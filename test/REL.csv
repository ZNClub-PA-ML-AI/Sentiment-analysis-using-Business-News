178,0.246525,"Reliance Communications Ltd (R-Com) is acquiring Sistema Shyam Teleservices Ltds wireless business for equity worth Rs.2,100 crore. It has also committed to paying Sistemas liabilities to the government, the present value of which is Rs.2,400 crore. 
				   
				These look like extremely high valuations for Sistemas loss-making operations, and the deal will only make sense if R-Com can monetize the spectrum assets through a favourable arrangement with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. R-Com has paid three times Sistemas annual revenues of Rs.1,500 crore. This is much higher than Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltds enterprise value to sales valuation of around 2.2 times. While these companies have operating profit margins of over 30%, Sistema reported operating losses were well over 30% of its revenues. Even if R-Com extracts all synergies possible and improves Sistemas operating profit to 30%a far crythe valuation still looks unpalatable at 10 times, far higher than 6-7 times EV/Ebitda valuation of incumbents. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. But Sistema holds 800 mega Hertz (MHz) spectrum in eight key circles, which can be extremely valuable for Reliance Jio. It will help in launching its LTE services, including voice over LTE, with much wider coverage, vis-a-vis spectrum in higher frequency bands.Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients, We see this transaction as just a precursor to a much larger transaction involving R-Com and R-Jio. We note that there is very little circle overlap between the liberalized 800MHz spectrum holdings of R-Jio and MTS (Sistema). Of the 10 circles in which Reliance Jio has 800MHz spectrum, six are in so-called C-level circles, which are the least lucrative in terms of revenue potential. Sistema holds spectrum in lucrative circles such as Delhi, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kolkata. Based on the discovered prices in this years auction (and using the reserve price in circles where there werent any bids), Sistemas spectrum in these eight circles is worth Rs.7,955 crore. Not all of this will necessarily flow into R-Coms books, even if Reliance Jio agrees to the price. This is because the governments spectrum-trading guidelines includes a clause that states that for any spectrum acquired in the March 2013 auction (such as Sistemas), trading will be permitted only if the price differential vis-a-vis the latest auction price is paid. The spectrum was acquired for Rs.3,639 crore, which means a differential of Rs.4,316 crore will need to be paid before this spectrum can be traded. Sistema has challenged this clause in the courts, and if it wins, R-Com will make it an additional payment of $300 million (approximately Rs.2,000 crore), according to a Sistema spokesman. R-Coms statement states, An appropriate payment/earn-out mechanism has been agreed in relation to disputed spectrum contiguity charges claimed by DoT. On the other hand, if the department of telecoms claim is upheld, Sistema will bear no liability. In either case, R-Com can only hope to recoup these additional costs when it sells the spectrum eventually to Reliance-Jio. All told, much depends on the outcome of this case. More depends on how much Reliance Jio is willing to cough up for spectrum in these eight circles. Doubtless, it will seek to tweak its outgo depending on R-Coms effective cost. R-Com chairman Anil Ambanis comments at the companys annual meeting suggested that a deal with Reliance-Jio is imminent. R-Coms market capitalization has risen by Rs.4,400 crore since then. Its doubtful Reliance-Jio will leave so much on the table, especially considering the fact that its capex has already reached unusually high levels. Investors should tone down their expectations.
Reliance Group companies have sued HT Media Ltd, Mints publisher, and nine others in the Bombay High court over a 2 October 2014 front-page story that they have disputed. HT Media is contesting the case.

439,0.178675,"When spot prices are lower than that of contracted long-term prices, it is natural for consumers to be reluctant to make long-term purchases. Thats what happened with Petronet LNG Ltd. Moreover, the anticipated revision of the RasGas, Qatar, contract led to further reduced offtake. 
				   
				For the December quarter, long-term volume was about 38 trillion British thermal units (trillion Btus), representing just two-fifths of the contracted volume. As a result of lower long-term volume, the firm had to bear ship idling charges worth about Rs.85 crore in the quarter.Sure, short-term volume and volume from services (tolling) increased, and compensated for the lack of long-term volume. Still, capacity utilization fell. Petronet LNGs Dahej Terminal has operated at around 109% of its nameplate capacity for the December quarter against 120% for the September quarter. The volume regasified at Dahej Terminal last quarter was 138 trillion Btus compared with 154 trillion Btus for the September quarter. The Kochi Terminal handled only a nominal volume of liquefied natural gas (LNG), according to the company.The outcome: Petronet LNG reported results sharply below expectations. Operating and net profits declined 32% and 28%, respectively, against the September quarter to Rs.316 crore and Rs.178 crore, respectively.But investors need not lose sleep over this. While the Petronet LNG stock has declined 7% from its annual high in January, it has substantially outperformed broader markets so far this fiscal year. The company has renegotiated the RasGas contract in December-end and that removes a key risk. The worst then could be behind us. Long-term volume is likely to recover in the current quarter. Outlook on spot volume too is not bad. Huge liquefaction capacities coming up in Australia and US will keep spot LNG prices subdued, resulting in higher demand for spot volume, point out analysts from Elara Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd.The Petronet LNG stock trades at 16 times next years earnings estimates, factoring in most of the positives. The firm maintains work for expansion of Dahej LNG Terminal from 10 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) to 15 mtpa is on track. The capacity expansion is likely to be completed by year end. Delays on that will not go down well with investors.

428,0.22025,"The ITC Ltd share has a resigned air about it as the budget day nears, as investors fear cigarettes may be hit by another round of excise duty hikes. The past few weeks have seen the share underperform the BSE FMCG index as well as the broad market. The surprise then, really, would be if it is spared an aggressive hike. In the past one year, the stock is down 26%, while the FMCG sector index is down by 17.2%.
				   
				Excise duties on cigarettes have been hiked in four consecutive budgets, knocking cigarette companies down every time they began to recover from the after-effects of the previous hike. ITC has protected its margins hitherto, passing on the full price hike to customers and reshaping its product mix to sell more premium products. Volume growth has suffered, however, as consumers shifted to cheaper products or if ITC were to be believed, to smuggled cigarettes.A Mint report on 24 February said retail cigarette prices have already gone up anticipating the hike and that stock market analysts are pencilling in an 8-10% hike in duties. That would not be considered a bad thing, especially if the increase were around the 8% level. The fear is if the government takes the duties up by a much higher quantum, say a 15% increase.In ITCs case, cigarette volumes have been hit hard, with an estimated 12% decline in volumes in FY16 as per an Edelweiss research report. Whats worse, its much feted profitability is also under pressure. In the December quarter, the cigarette segments profit margin declined by 1.6 percentage points over a year ago. That is a concern.There are two main triggers to watch for in FY17. A moderate hike in excise duty is likely to be welcomed. The second one is up in the air, really, at this moment. Broad urban consumption trends signals a revival may be in the works. What is common to buying shampoos and cigarettes? Nothing.Some years ago, cigarette consumption was considered to be relatively price-inelastic. Indeed, smokers puffed through price hikes without noticing it. But steep successive duty hikes and the price hikes that followed appear to haveat least temporarilydamaged this inelasticity. Affordability has become an issue. So, if urban incomes turn healthier, affordability should improve, which may in turn influence demand. Price may not be the only reason for declining volumes and maybe the anti-smoking efforts are also succeeding. That is another angle to this story. For the moment, the severity of the likely excise duty hike is rightfully hogging all the attention.",2016-02-24,xgaUWQC2pl889DJNqDp86J,"The ITC share has a resigned air about it as the budget day nears, as investors fear cigarettes may be hit by another round of excise duty hikes

27,0.244925,"Reacting to the railway budget, one industry stakeholder told a business news channel that he was happy with the announcements as long as he didnt think about how they would be funded. That aptly sums up the mood on the Street, which dumped railway-related stocks after the budget was presented.The highlight, of course, is the scaling up of capital expenditure (capex) to Rs.1.2 trillion for the next fiscal year, which is entirely commendable. But believing the big numbers requires a leap of faith.First, the targets set for the current fiscal year are seeing sharp cuts. Capex for the current year has been revised down from around Rs.1 trillion to Rs.82,192 crore. To be sure, thats far higher than what the railways has been clocking for years. But as of December, the national transporter spent only 64% of the revised capex target, an increase of less than one-fourth from the year-ago period.The second problem is resource generation. After meeting all expenditure, Indian Railways is estimated to generate net revenue of Rs.18,210 crore in the next fiscal year. It is not only 8% less than the current fiscal years revised estimate (which itself has been cut) but is also prone to serious downward revisions.Total traffic receipts (both from freight and passenger fares) are estimated to rise 10%, optimistic considering the lack of upward revision of tariffs. As in the previous budget, the ministry is projecting a double-digit (12%) growth in passenger earnings, when the number of passengers is actually declining. The expected fall is 1.5% in the current fiscal year. This year, passenger revenue is expected to go up by 7%. True, freight revenue growth projections are realistic at 5%. But lack of time-bound measures to revive the flagging volumesestimated to grow just 1% in the current fiscal yearhas been a disappointment.Of course, a significant part of the Plan expenditure is funded by support from the Union budget, borrowings and institutional finance. But as Religare Capital Markets Ltd points out, resources from all these sources have fallen short of budget estimates. If economic activity does not see a meaningful recovery and the governments fiscal position remains stretched, then it is likely the budgetary support for next fiscal year will also be constrained.The railways plans to further lower costs and boost non-traffic revenue. While the ministry has achieved some success in cost-control measures, non-traffic revenue is showing no signs of improvement yetin fact, it is expected to fall 8% this year.All this gives way to some doubts about the budget estimates. The poor performance in FY16 has few excuses, unless the projections for FY16 were too ambitious to begin with, Religare Capital Markets wrote in a note. One cannot help but be sceptical of FY17 projections, therefore, especially on the funding part of the planned expenditure.However, there is no denying that the railways capex is growing. As Dilip Bhat, joint managing director at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd, points out, even if the railways manages to achieve capex of Rs.1 trillion next fiscal year, it will be a significant improvement from the Rs.40,000-60,000 crore the organization was spending some years back.While that is a clear indication of the governments push to kick-start growth through increased public investments, the fact remains that the numbers need to be taken with a pinch of salt.",2016-02-26,4K3Wxb6Muf9pmFztI6WoqM,"The highlight of railways budget is the scaling up of capital expenditure to Rs1.2 trillion for the next fiscal year, which is commendable, but believing the big numbers requires a leap of faith

90,0.12645,"The telecom industry was among those that disappointed investors in the March quarter.
				   
				Growth in both revenue and profit declined, largely because of a higher-than-expected drop in realizations, but also because of lower volume growth.The big surprise in the results was the sharp deceleration in growth in the data segment. In the case of Idea Cellular Ltd, data revenue grew 45% year-on-year last quarter, a sharp drop from the over 80% growth just two quarters ago. Price realizations in the segment fell by as high as 17% year-on-year. For Bharti Airtel Ltd, data realizations fell 13.1% last quarter, much higher than the 5.6% drop reported in the September quarter.Idea Cellulars management said in a note to investors, (there is) intense pressure on the mobile data realized rate, as wireless broadband consumer demand growth is slower than increased supply from operators launching/expanding 3G/4G footprints. Its quite disheartening, from an investors perspective, that this is happening even ahead of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds launch. Supply will increase manifold when Jio launches its services commercially.Incumbents such as Idea and Bharti have spent vast amounts of money in purchasing spectrum, and have stepped up capital expenditure to capitalize on the data opportunity. The December quarter results suggest that data is proving to be a drag rather than a money-spinner. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities wrote in a note to clients, We are slightly concerned about the data volume trajectory, especially in the context of accelerated 3G/4G network rollouts by the operators. We, however, think it is too early to call out a definitive trend here.Investors are taking a very grim view of the future. Idea Cellulars shares have corrected by nearly one-fourth so far this year, and while Bhartis shares have been fairly resilient, returns for investors remain abysmal.

16,-0.0903,"An investment recovery and the health of the banking system are inextricably linked. The banking industry needs cash. Bloated with bad loans, state-owned banks require Rs.1 trillion in the near term, estimate brokerage firms and rating agencies. The government, on the other hand, has allotted only Rs.25,000 crore for this year under its so-called Indradhanush programme.
				   
				Consider this statistic: In the December quarter alone, banks posted a cumulative loss of Rs.10,911 crore, which is slightly over two-fifths of governments proposed capital infusion. Credit Suisse estimates that unprovided problem loans are now at 65-200% of public sector banks capital.The capital requirement will grow further as most banks are yet to recognize some more bad loans. The chart shows how badly banks need capital. Overall, estimated capital requirement for the banking system is between Rs.2.5 trillion and Rs.3 trillion over the next four years compared with the governments promise of Rs.70,000 crore.Clearly, given its fiscal constraints the government may not be able to cough up any huge amount upfront, especially after the Seventh Pay Commission and 14th Finance Commission recommendations. The solution to the bad loan problem, which will free up cash for banks and enable them to accumulate it out of profits, lies in policy measures.A comprehensive bankruptcy code was promised in the last budget; it is in the works and yet to become law. Another idea that has taken hold in recent times is the creation of a bad bank, some version of the USs Troubled Asset Relief Programme after the 2008 crisis. This would be a sovereign-backed asset reconstruction company. But that doesnt save taxpayers from taking a hit as someone would have to make good those losses. It also creates a moral hazard as banks arent made liable for their past bad decisions.Of course, the government can reduce its stake below 51% in public sector banks. It can always bring down its stake to 33% while still keeping voting rights intact. The big concern here is cheap valuations currently and hurdles from bank unions and accusations of selling the family silver.

				It was in April 2015 that USL informed shareholders that the board had lost confidence in Mallyas continuation as chairman. This was after an internal inquiry confirmed funds diversion from USL to UB group companies.But they could not make him go. When Diageo entered as a majority shareholder, it had agreed to keep Mallya as chairman, as long as the UB group held a 1% stake. That smart move on Mallyas part allowed him to remain chairman till date. The current arrangement breaks the stalemate.While Diageo is paying money to Mallya and has made certain other concessions, USL has decided to not proceed on the financial irregularities uncovered in the internal inquiry and also made some financial concessions. In turn, UB group entities will terminate old business agreements with USL, freeing it of further financial obligations.Shareholders may look at this as good riddance. The money was already gone and a long and messy legal battle awaited them if they tried to recover it. The companys management can instead focus their full energies on running the business. Operationally, nothing will change as Diageo-appointed managers are already running the show. The liquor industry is going through difficult times as it is, with regulatory and policy changes affecting growth. USL reported flat growth in the December quarter in volume terms.But the stink from this episode wont go away so soon. News reports indicate that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) may probe the current transaction. There are other investigations going on pertaining to these irregularities. There are questions on whether USL did right by settling or whether it should have tried to recover the amounts. It also raises uncomfortable questions about the quality of governance and oversight, even among well-known listed companies, if irregularities of this nature and magnitude come out only when a newcomer replaces the incumbent management.USLs share has risen by 20% since 18 February, whereas the announcement was made only on 25 February (a day when the share rose by only 2.4%).

In comparison, coal stocks at power plants were 9-10 days last year.February numbers were announced on Tuesday after market hours. On Wednesday, the CIL stock declined about 2%, on a day when the benchmark Sensex increased 2%.Nevertheless, performance for the year so far is nothing to complain about. Production and offtake growth between April-February was 9.2% and 9.3%, respectively, representing 97% of the targeted level for each. Achieving the full-year target looks difficult. The implied production/offtake year-on-year growth in March is 27%/41%, for the company to achieve its fiscal year 2016 targets. Thats a tall order.CIL shares showed a modest gain after it announced better-than-expected December quarter results. Demand concerns and muted outlook on realizations continue to weigh on the stock. There is hope that power sector demand could improve during the summer season and thus lead to better offtake in the near future. That remains to be seen. Demand from non-power sector (especially the cement industry) though, isnt particularly bright and the situation may persist for some time.Further, doubling of the clean environment cess on coal to Rs.400 a tonne is expected to have an adverse impact. Sure, this increase will be passed on to consumers. But the 3-7% rise in cost of coal-fired electricity generation triggered by doubling the cess arguably reduces the scope (capability and magnitude) for CIL to raise notified prices in fiscal year 2017, say analysts from Nomura Research.Also, the disinvestment overhang could persist. FY17 disinvestment target (excluding strategic sale) is set at a high level againRs.360 billion (Rs.36,000 crore) versus FY16 budget/revised target of Rs.410 billion/Rs.253 billionimplying a lingering equity overhang for Coal India, wrote Nomura analysts in a report on 1 March.

242,0.156875,"Life just got complicated for those who had rested their case for a prolonged bear market in iron ore. Falling iron ore prices have reversed swiftly and Mondays 19% increase surprised everyone. Even if this is a blip, it is no ordinary one as iron ore prices have gained 46% so far this year. Fundamentals have not changed though. Here are five reasons why the case for a sustained increase in iron ore prices does not seem convincing yet:
				   
				1. Globally, commodity prices are enjoying a reprieve from a punishing decline, with crude oil leading from the front. There are no visible reasons underpinning this recovery, making some wonder if this will continue. If global commodities resume their decline, then iron ore is likely to follow suit.2. One prime reason why iron ore prices had been falling is an increase in mined output at a time when the global outlook for steel was weak. There is no change in the situation. Large miners have deferred future capex plans but are looking to finish building factories where money is already sunk. All said, rising iron ore output remains a threat.3. Chinas weak economic outlook was another reason for depressed iron ore prices. Recently declared economic growth targets for 2016 and the next five years, and indications that the Chinese government will support growth, appear to have been taken at face value. Tuesday provided a reality check: Chinas exports in February fell by 25.4%.4. As of January, steel output trends based on the World Steel Associations data do not indicate a trend reversal, especially in China. Heres a twist. A Reuters report dated 7 March says steel mills in Tangshan, China may have to limit output between 29 April and 16 October, to lower air pollution to facilitate a horticultural event. Tangshan is a top steel producing region. The fear is that steel plants may produce more now to stock up for the period when production will be slack. This in turn may lead to higher demand for iron ore and, therefore, higher prices now, but wont be enough to support prices for more than a few months.5. Global steel demand continues to be weak. Chinas steel exports have been flooding global markets prompting countries to take anti-dumping measures. Two factors can reverse this flood; Chinas domestic steel demand recovers or it limits steel output through permanent measures such as shutting down plants. A demand recovery in other major economies too could be a trigger. Till that happens, it is difficult to accept that this iron ore rally has legs made of steel.For the moment, higher iron ore prices and the resultant likely increase in steel prices bode well both for miners and steel companies.

300,0.245825,"Cement prices in northern India have reversed after staying down for long. Dealers say producers hiked prices suddenly by Rs.10-15/bag of 50 kg in February and another Rs.50-70/bag in early March. With average cement prices in February at Rs.267/bag, thats a substantial increase in March.
				   
				This does not appear to be an isolated instance but is not yet a widespread trend. The price increase in the north does appear to have spread to the nearby central region. But the western Indian market is subdued and in the southern parts, prices have retraced a bit after ruling strong for over a year. As for the eastern market, where prices are normally firm, it faced challenges.Binod Modi, an analyst at Reliance Securities, wrote in a report that cement prices in the north had slid to unviable levels since September, which was reflected in the weak December quarter performance. A bounce was waiting to happen. North-based companies are also following the price discipline displayed by their southern counterparts. Lower production has led to a tighter market. In addition, there has been a slow but sustained increase in demand due to government spending on infrastructure and low-cost housing.Meanwhile, dealers hope that higher budgetary support in fiscal year 2017 for infrastructure and housing will have a multiplier effect on cement demand. That may still not be enough to solve the problem of oversupply. Analysts at India Ratings and Research Pvt. Ltd said in a Webinar that cement capacity is likely to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.9% in the fiscal years between 2015 and 2017. They watered down demand growth in fiscal year 2016 from the earlier 6.5-8% to 3%.If profit margins are expected to remain stable even then, it is because of lower freight and energy costs.From an investors standpoint, the sector is more stable now than in the past two-three years. But most of these positives are factored into valuations of large companies such as UltraTech Cement Ltd, Ambuja Cements Ltd and Ramco Cements Ltd. Besides, input prices have been subdued for long.

218,0.2005,"In late October, Silicon Valley venture capitalist Bill Gurley, speaking to The Wall Street Journal about technology start-up valuations, said, All these private valuations are fake. Theyre all on paper.
				   
				Gurley, managing partner at San Francisco-based venture capital firm Benchmark, has been openly critical for a while of the dizzying valuations attributed to technology start-ups in recent years. His criticism is directed in particular at unicorns, the common term for technology start-ups privately valued at $1 billion or more.Until a couple of months ago, Gurleys criticism had few takers in Indias start-up ecosystem. In fact, back in October, few venture capitalists and even fewer entrepreneurs would concede to a valuation bubble.Sure, there had been a few upsets. Zomato, the restaurant discovery platform backed by Info Edge India Ltd and Sequoia Capital, had fired 10% of its staff as part of a cost rationalization drive. Food ordering start-up TinyOwl, backed by Matrix Partners and Sequoia, had laid off more than 100 people and shut down offices in some cities as it battled a cash crunch. Property search and listings platform Commonfloor was on the block as it failed to draw fresh capital despite having investors such as Tiger Global Management and Google Capital on board.But, unlike elsewhere in the world, where unicorn valuations were being marked down with alarming frequency by mutual funds, Indias unicorns held their mythical valuations. E-commerce bellwether Flipkart was still going strong at $15.2 billion. Rival Snapdeal was cruising along at about $5 billion. Budget stays aggregator and unicorn aspirant OYO Rooms had just snapped up $100 million from Japanese investor SoftBank and others, taking its valuation to a reported $400 million. Even seed-stage start-ups were raking in $1 million rounds. What bubble?In the past two months, however, some of that exuberance has tempered. People still arent talking in bubble terms, but they admit that a correction is underway in Indias start-up funding market. The correction is evident from the numbers for the concluding quarter of 2015. A KPMG report, based on data compiled by research firm CB Insights, shows that venture capital-backed firms in India raised $1.5 billion in October-December 2015, down 46% from the $2.8 billion raised in the July-September quarter. The volume of deals also declined to 114 from 139 in the preceding quarter.The numbers are down primarily because of a correction in later funding rounds, specifically in the Series B and C stages where valuations were most frothy. A quick survey of deals reported across media shows that after September, there has been a marked decline in Series B and C stage deals, especially in terms of value. Compared with the past, only one deal crossed the $100 million markhyperlocal delivery service Grofers raised $120 million in a Series B round led by SoftBank. The ticket sizes of the remaining 15 deals in those stages were well below the $50 million mark. After Grofers, the three largest deals involved e-commerce company Naaptol ($52 million), PepperTap, another hyperlocal delivery service ($40 million), and ethnic products marketplace Craftsvilla ($34 million).Apart from the decline in deal ticket sizes, later-stage rounds are also in a somewhat different complexion in terms of the investors involved. Out of the 16 deals reported, six were led by strategic investors such as SoftBank, Paytm, Snapdeal, Amazon, Mitsui, and even a local family office backed by the Murugappa Group. Venture capital firms have been less visible, preferring to divert their resources to younger companies at the seed and Series A stages. Not because their resources are running scarceIndia-dedicated venture capital funds raised a little more than $2 billion in fresh capital last year, according to data compiled by the Emerging Markets Private Equity Association.Most venture capitalists believe that valuations will correct further. In January, Mint reported that practically every leading venture capital fund in the market expects valuations for mid-stage deals to be between 25% and 50% lower than the 2015 levels. That, most reckon, will take another 6-8 months to play out, and theyre willing to wait. They can afford to wait because hedge funds, notably New York-based Tiger Global (which invests in start-ups from a separate venture capital fund), are no longer breathing down their necks. Hedge funds, until recently among the most aggressive dealmakers in Indias start-up market, are on a hiatus due to the recent turmoil in the public markets.While venture capitalists have started to come to terms with the downturn, entrepreneurs are still holding out. This isnt unusual. Historically, private valuations have always lagged the public markets by a few months. But, theres no doubt that they will eventually correct. Entrepreneurs can take cues from the recent markdown of the value of Flipkart shares owned by mutual funds. The latest to do so is Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund Trust, which has written down the value of its minor stake to $58.9 million, as of 31 December, from $80.6 million in June.The Morgan Stanley markdown brings Flipkarts valuation down to about $11 billion from the $15.2 billion the company claimed when it raised its last round of funds. Thats a fairly big hit, assuming that the lofty valuations that Flipkart claims arent, as Gurley suggests, imaginary.Flipkart is a bit of a lodestar for the countrys start-up ecosystem. That makes the markdown the strongest manifestation yet of the correction that is currently underway in Indias start-up funding market.Winter is here. Make no mistake.

176,0.243475,"The government announced a slew of measures in the hydrocarbon sector on Thursday that are expected to have a positive impact on the Indian energy sector in the long run. Importantly, there will be a uniform licensing system which will cover all hydrocarbons, i.e. oil, gas, coal bed methane, etc., which should help companies explore all kinds of oil and gas resources under one licence.
				   
				The blocks under the new policy will be awarded through an open-acreage policy, which will enable E&P (exploration and production) companies choose the blocks from the designated area. Also, there is a shift to a revenue-sharing model, which will be easy to administer for the government. The measures announced are positive for the sector and are expected to simplify licensing rules and accordingly boost investments in the sector.Whats in it for investors?One of the key announcements made is allowing pricing and marketing freedom for natural gas produced from difficult terrain. This would be applicable to all discoveries in deep water/ultra-deep water/high temperature/high pressure areas which were yet to commence commercial production as on 1 January 2016 and for all future discoveries in such areas.However, there is a ceiling price, which means that prices will not be totally free. According to analysts, the ceiling price based on new guidelines, starting 1 April works out to $6-6.5 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). Domestic gas prices are at $3.82 per mmBtu currently. That looks attractive but its important to realize that the benefits from this development are not going to be visible in the near future.As Nitin Tiwari, an analyst at Antique Stock Broking Pvt. Ltd, says, the new pricing for production from difficult fields could be beneficial for Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) when its KG-DWN-98/2 starts production. Similarly, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) too could benefit when it starts production from its R-Cluster and satellite fields. However, production from the above mentioned fields may start by FY19 or beyond, which means benefits from the development are accordingly going to accrue in the longer-run, than in near term, points out Tiwari.Secondly, the state of the macro environment and commodity (crude/NG/FO) prices would also be crucial for above mentioned developments as policy itself is not a sufficient condition to facilitate investment, he adds. The government has also said that in case of pending arbitration or litigation pertaining to gas pricing covering such fields, the new rules will be applicable only on the conclusion/withdrawal of such litigation/arbitration. This does not augur well for RIL, which is currently in a legal battle with the government over gas pricing. On Thursday, the ONGC stock had increased marginally, while RILs share price declined about 3%.",2016-03-11,OtBsKD5ZpPBcVmeUXksTsM,"The government announced a slew of measures in the hydrocarbon sector on Thursday that are expected to have a positive impact on the Indian energy sector in the long run

89,0.24635,"Last November, when Idea Cellular Ltd agreed to pay top dollar for Videocon Telecommunications Ltds spectrum, it looked like the much-awaited consolidation in the industry was becoming a costly exercise. But Idea Cellular has walked out of the deal, and while Videocon has found another buyer in Bharti Airtel Ltd, valuations have come crashing down. 
				   
				Its premature to conclude that rationality has returned to the industry. Even so, the Videocon deal has some heartening takeawaysof course, for everyone except Videocon. The delay in Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds launch means companies can breathe a bit easier. And the likelihood that the government will harmonize spectrum in 1800 megahertz (MHz) band before this years auction means that this resource may not be as scarce as was earlier feared. Idea Cellular had agreed to pay Rs.3,310 crore for contiguous 1800MHz spectrum in Gujarat and UP (West) circles. This effectively worked out to a 133% premium vis-à-vis the latest reserve price recommended by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. By the same measure, Videocon may have expected another Rs.3,000 crore for the remaining four circles in which it has similar spectrum. That means the amount for all six circles would be about Rs.6,610 crore. Instead, it has agreed to sell spectrum in all six circles to Bharti Airtel for a much lower amount of Rs.4,428 crore. While Videocon has settled for lower valuations vis-à-vis last November, the sale price represents a 100% premium to its purchase price. Another way to look at the deal is that Bharti Airtel is acquiring the spectrum at 34% of the last discovered price for 900MHz spectrum in these circles, whereas Idea Cellular had agreed to pay as much as 55% for the two circles it had agreed to buy. According to analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, the price of 1800 relative to the price of 900 was 35% in A-category circles and 47% in metro circles in the March 2015 auctions. Bharti Airtel, therefore, appears to have struck a reasonable deal, especially keeping in mind that the entire spectrum is contiguous and hence suitable for deploying 4G services. The six circles contribute to 23% of Bharti Airtels revenue. Also, it will now have 4G spectrum in 19 circles, versus 15 earlier. Bhartis 4G-1800 spectrum footprint is now slightly better than that of Reliance Jio, JM Financials analysts wrote in a 17 March note. Interestingly, while Bharti Airtel shares rose 1.3% on the National Stock Exchange on Thursday, those of Idea Cellular gained 3.15%. Of course, investors will be relieved that Idea Cellular backed out of the expensive deal. And as far as the gaps in its 4G footprint go, the auction later this year is likely to provide opportunities to fill them. Besides, as pointed out earlier, with the delay in Reliance Jios launch, companies have been able to breathe a bit easy. Having said all this, the industry is far from being out of the woods. At best, Idea Cellular may have ended up saving about Rs.1,000 crore, which isnt much, considering that it had paid as much as Rs.30,000 crore in the March 2015 auction. Recent data suggests that growth in data revenue is falling and is calling to question the high amounts firms have spent on spectrum purchases and network roll-outs. Its little wonder that since April last year, Idea Cellular shares have nearly halved.",2016-03-17,BgcOlRFxdzfZCojoG4ZjbK,"Idea Cellular has walked out of the deal, and while Videocon has found another buyer in Bharti Airtel, valuations have come crashing down

184,0.248175,"The world remains on a fragile recovery path after the 2008 crisis, yet there has been no slowdown in the growth of extreme wealth. From 1996 to 2014, billionaires wealth worldwide has grown six-and-a-half times; for Indian (dollar) billionaires this growth has been a phenomenal 40%, says a paper from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in the US.
				   
				A majority of these billionaires are self made. Data from a paper, The Origins of the Super Rich: The Billionaire Characteristics Database, by Caroline Freund and Sarah Oliver, shows that 63% of Indias billionaires are self made, and their wealth accounts for about 49% of the total wealth of billionaires in the country. In emerging markets, close to 80% of billionaires are self made.In 1996, China did not have a single billionaire. Fast forward to 2014, and the list of Chinese billionaires has risen to 153. Only three of these billionaires have inherited their wealth, and only two have political connections that have helped them expand their fortunes. Within Europe, wealth has moved eastwards, while in Asia, wealth has moved from Japan to China.This fast growth of self made billionaires can be seen in India tooself made billionaires grew their wealth nearly 17 times since 2001, compared to nine times for those who inherited wealth. In Europe, in contrast, billionaire wealth is still largely inherited, and over 20% of inherited billionaires are fourth-generation or later. At close to 50%, Latin America accounts for the largest share of inherited billionaires, followed closely by the Middle East, where about 44% of all billionaires have inherited their wealth.The authors of the paper have one caveat though: their source of data is the Forbes magazine rich list. They say that it is possible that some private companies may not have made it to the list as valuation is difficult. The other concern is that inherited wealth is more likely to be diversified, and thus may have been overlooked. Here are four sets of charts that examine the characteristics of billionaires.The list of inherited billionaires includes names from Indias biggest corporate houses: Kumaramangalam Birla, Venugopal Dhoot, Pankaj Patel and Adi Godrej, to name a few. The technology sector accounts for the greatest share of self made billionaires in India. This is closely followed by the consumer sector, which has names like jeweller Nirav Modi and soft drinks maker Ravi Jaipuria.In 1996, India had only three billionairesDhirubhai Ambani, Lakshmi Mittal and Kumaramangalam Birla. By 2001, Mittal had left this list, but Shiv Nadar and Azim Premji made their entry. The entrance of Nadar and Premji, both of whom built their wealth in the IT sector, was a sign of the riches that leaders of this sector would reap. It took only 13 years for the list of billionaires to grow from five to 56. By 2014, the IT sector in India accounted for seven billionaires.Who are the billionaires who lead consumer firms in India? This list includes leaders of several automotive and related industries such as Rahul Bajaj, Vikram Lal, Baba Kalyani and Lachhman Das Mittal. The richest Indian billionaire is Mukesh Ambani, closely followed by Lakshmi Mittal and Premji.In 1996, there were 31 women billionaires worldwide. By 2014, that number increased by 480% to 180. However, this is way behind the overall rate of increase of billionaires worldwide. Only two Indian women, Savitri Jindal and Indu Jain, are billionaires. Globally, only 43 women are self made billionaires.

286,0.246,"Bata India Ltd hasnt had it easy.
				   
				In the last few quarters, weaker spending trends, supply chain issues and fierce competition from the online platform have weighed on the companys performance.But valuations at about 32 times next years estimated earnings are not cheap and the stock has risen 12% from its January lows.In the near future, therefore, there are few reasons for further appreciation.According to Ambit Capital Pvt. Ltd, under-investment in brand (Rs.110 crore over FY09-15) and over-investment in stores (Rs.500 crore over the same period) will mar asset turns (2.4 times in FY17 from 3.1 times in CY09), with increasing competition fuelled by e-commerce.Additionally, foreign brands pose a direct threat to 12-15% of Batas portfolio and can impede growth of the Power brand, pointed out Ambit, adding that every 5% fall in Powers revenues alone will impact earnings per share by 3%.Power is a sports shoes brand.It goes without saying that the impact on earnings will be greater if online competition eats into other parts of the product portfolio as well.In any case, the subdued macroeconomy means that substantial improvement in same-store sales growth will be at bay for some time.The companys performance for the year so far is not encouraging. For the nine months to December, Bata Indias revenue increased about 10%, compared with last year. However, a faster pace of growth in costs and a decline in other income meant pre-tax and exceptional items earnings declined nearly 10%.What can offer some comfort?Store rationalization is one factor. We understand that replacing its earlier aggressive store expansion strategy, Bata is adopting a calibrated approach in widening its retail footprint, wrote analysts from Spark Capital Advisors (India) Pvt. Ltd in a note to clients on 26 February.Secondly, optimizing rent expenses will be helpful in boosting earnings growth.We realize that not only are rental leases being re-negotiated to take advantage of the subdued real estate environment, but store sizes are also being optimized to drive efficiency, the Spark note said.According to the brokerage, Batas rental cost has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of ~24% versus ~14% revenue growth in CY10-FY16E, pegging rental at ~13.9% of sales in FY15 versus ~9% in CY10.

339,-0.2469,"Cigarette firms are stopping production, apparently in protest against the governments decision not to withdraw new graphic health warnings. This development could worry investors as lost output may lead to lost sales. Since the deadline was known, firms are likely to have stocked up in advance to ensure retail sales are not affected. The bigger worry for investors should be if these warnings are implemented and they lead to a further drop in cigarette consumption.
				   
				The new norms, in effect from 1 April, require cigarette firms to display a graphic warning that covers 85% of the cigarette pack on both sides from the current 40%. A parliamentary committee had recently submitted recommendations for a lower area of 50% to be covered, according to news reports. Since the government has not said anything yet, the new guidelines have taken effect. ITC Ltd says it is unprepared for the change and is stopping production.If this is a pressure tactic, the companies may keep output shut for long. If not, then companies will change their packaging and resume production. After all, this change has been in the works for long.Investors will be puzzled if this becomes a long-drawn affair. After all, analysts have said that most cigarettes in India are sold loose; so packets and their warnings are not that big a problem. In fact, a ban on loose cigarettes is what had them worried, and there is no sign of that happening. Therefore, the impact should be minimal.But it may not be that simple. Even if loose sale is not banned, the packs themselves are visible on shelves even now, making a bigger warning more visible. The portion of smokers who do buy packs may be influenced by bigger warnings.That brings us to the last question. Do bigger warnings really matter to smokers? They can already read them on the packs now. Global studies conclude that graphic warnings do play a role in reducing cigarette consumption. The Global Adult Tobacco Survey, prepared by the World Health Organization (WHO), states that the number of people thinking of quitting smoking due to health warnings has increased from 46.3% in 2008 to 53% in 2012. In India, in 2010, 28.6% were considering quitting smoking due to these warnings. If a pictorial warning more than doubles in size, this percentage may increase.Of course, thinking of quitting and actually quitting are two different things. However, concerted efforts to reduce smoking may work. The WHOs 2015 global report on trends in the prevalence of tobacco smoking says that Indias smoking population was 13% in 2010 and if tobacco control efforts continue at the same intensity then WHO projects that this will come down to 8% in 2025.That should be a worry for the industry.The immediate impact may be negligible as companies may already have inventory to sell. Eventually, if the government remains firm, companies will have to sell cigarettes with the new packs. After some years, the impact of the size and type of warnings can be assessed. Just as investors in cigarette stocks were relieved that the increase in excise duties was manageable, a new problem has landed at their doorstep.",2016-04-04,l7DQyNheesgzgsezHcBeGI,"Just as investors in cigarette stocks were relieved that the increase in excise duties was manageable, a new problem has landed at their doorstep

66,0.248475,"KEC International Ltd gained 2% on Friday after the company said it received new orders worth Rs.836 crore.
				   
				This is the second large set of orders KEC has won in two weeks. On 17 March, it had announced new orders worth Rs.1,041 crore.With the latest gain, the stock is up 23% from February lows, recouping almost half of the losses it saw earlier this year. It lost one-third of its value in January and February as the slump in crude oil prices stoked concerns about its business in the West Asian countries. Around 15% of KECs outstanding order book is from that region. In a conference call with analysts, KEC had said it is yet to see any slackening of its order pipeline in West Asia. But that did not cut much icethe stock fell after the third quarter results.Instead, what is helping the stock are strong order inflows and management commentary on prospects in India and other markets. The latest order wins comes on the back of a 26% rise in inflows till the first week of February. More than half of the 17 March orders are from overseas (Ghana, Americas). Last weeks orders are mostly from India. This lends credence to the belief that diversification (both geographical and in services) is helping KEC navigate the business environment better, especially the overseas markets from which it derives half of the business.The company is seeing large tenders opening in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. Operations in Mexico are turning around. In India, apart from transmission, opportunities are emerging in the railways and solar energy sectors. KEC highlighted it is also seeing healthy traction in solar and railway segments (tenders worth Rs.25 billion (Rs.2,500 crore) up for bidding), Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd said in a note.In 2016-17, KEC is targeting revenues to rise 10-12%, which will be a notable improvement from the year gone by. Revenues were flat, or increased just 0.2%, in the first nine months of 2015-16. From Rs.3,000 crore in February, KECs deal pipeline increased to Rs.4,200 crore, the company told ET Now. As these bids convert into orders, the order book will rise further.According to IndiaNivesh Securities Ltd, the outlook for KECs core transmission and distribution (T&D) business in India is strong with the sector estimated to see an investment of almost Rs.3 trillion over the next four years. So, even if West Asia sees any slowdown in T&D spends, KEC can maintain the revenue momentum.

120,0.241,"The first quarter of 2016 has been tough but not all grim for Indias start-up market. Start-ups across sectors continued to attract early and growth capital, even staging a small recovery from the slump reported in the previous quarter in terms of overall capital raised. Data compiled by London-based Preqin puts the total value of venture capital deals concluded during the January-March quarter at $1.6 billion, up 47% from the fourth quarter of 2015.
				   
				The surge comes largely on the back of a handful of big-ticket deals that closed despite the withdrawal of a host of later-stage investors, such as hedge funds, from the market. In January, online travel company MakeMyTrip raised a $180 million round from Shanghai-based travel services company Ctrip. The same month, private equity investors Temasek Holdings and Warburg Pincus participated in a $145 million round in auto classifieds platform CarTrade. February saw e-commerce marketplace Snapdeal announce a $200 million investment led by Canadian pension fund Ontario Teachers Pension Plan (though a sizeable portion was paid out to venture capital firms Saama Capital and Sequoia Capital, who sold stakes in the company). And in March, grocery e-tailer BigBasket raised $150 million from an investor consortium that included The Abraaj Group and Sands Capital Management.However, these deals dont necessarily indicate that the funding slowdown that became official in the last quarter of 2015 is now a thing of the past.Since were specifically concerned with how early-stage investors behaved during the quarter, we will take into account deals that were concluded at the angel and seed stages and, separately, at the Series A through C stages. At the angel and seed stages, investors closed 146 deals worth $35 million. That represents a 46% drop in value terms when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, even though the volume of deals grew 5%. This may have happened because of two factors. One, venture capital firms have cut back on the big seed-investment programmes that were all the rage till late last year. Now that entry valuations at later-stage start-ups, particularly at the Series B and C stages, are becoming less expensive, theyd much rather divert more capital that way. Two, the ticket sizes of deals at the seed stage may have started coming back to normal. Remember, not too many quarters ago, it wasnt unusual to hear of seed rounds closing at $2 million.Now lets look at the Series A through C stages, venture capitals traditional playground. Venture capitalists closed 33 early deals worth $172 million at the Series A through C stages. Thats a 19.5% decline in terms of volume and a bruising 57.5% decline in value terms compared to the October-December 2015 quarter. The big casualties are the Series B and C stages. This is where start-ups, fed on a staple of generous deal ticket sizes and even more generous valuations for most of last year, are hurting the most.Investors deployed just $34 million across eight Series B deals, against $130 million across 10 deals in the October-December quarter. The Series C stage reported $53 million deployed across four deals, compared to $179 million and three deals in the last quarter.The slower pace of investments at the Series B and C stages means that venture capitalists are still not comfortable with the valuations that are being sought by companies at those stages. By Preqins estimates, India-focused venture capital funds are sitting on dry powder or uninvested capital worth $3.4 billion. That capital, going by how investors have behaved in the first quarter, is not going anywhere in a hurry.Snigdha Sengupta is a freelance journalist based in Mumbai and founder of StartupCentral.

394,0.246775,"Just when you think Bharti Airtel Ltd already has all the mobile spectrum it needs, the company goes ahead and buys some more. Last Friday, it announced it will pay Rs.3,500 crore to buy spectrum in the 2300MHz band from Aircel Ltd in eight telecom circles. This is less than a month after it agreed to pay Videocon Telecommunications Ltd Rs.4,430 crore for spectrum in the 1800MHz band in six circles. The spectrum in both these bands is suited for fourth-generation (4G) telecom services.
				   
				Growth for telecom companies is already being driven largely by the data segment; in Bhartis case, voice revenue has declined on a year-on-year basis in the past three quarters. In this backdrop, it makes sense to have adequate spectrum to support efficient data services.Analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd point out in a note to clients, With this deal, Bharti will have 490MHz of broadband (3G+4G) spectrum on aggregate basis across the 22 circles, versus 486MHz of all 4G spectrum owned by Jio. Bharti now has 4G-spectrum (i.e. 1800MHz or 2300MHz) in all 22 circles, and both 1800/2300 frequencies in 13 circles.Besides the wide coverage, spectrum trading has opened a new avenue for purchasing the hitherto scarce asset. In spectrum auctions, the only avenue available earlier, companies often ended up bidding up prices to extremely high levels. After adjusting Aircels spectrum valuation for its remaining validity of roughly 14.5 years, Bharti Airtel has ended up paying around 10% higher than the reserve price set by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.If Bharti had let the opportunity pass and waited for the auctions, it may have had to shell out a substantially higher amount. JM Financials analysts say, We now expect Bharti to focus primarily on filling up its 2100 (3G) and 1800 (4G) gaps in the next auction; reduced competition for 2300 augurs well for other 4G-contenders like Idea/Vodafone. Of course, the deal is a win-win for Aircel as well; this helps it reduce its debt by about one-fifth, according to news reports.While the deal augurs well for Bharti in the long run, investors must note that the benefits may not be visible anytime soon. As it is, the pace of data subscriber additions has slowed, calling to question the large investments on this segment. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds launch later this year could put a spoke in the wheel as well.Even so, these are early days of consolidation and, eventually, subscribers may veer towards telecom operators who provide the best service.

In the March quarter, this segment, which accounts for some 65% of the firms revenues, grew its sales 21.8% from a year ago. A changing global regulatory environment and newer analytics products seem to be boosting this segments growth for Crisil, which started life as a credit rater.
				   
				Ebit (earnings before interest and taxes) growth for the research segment was 49.6% from a year ago, helped by expanding margins. Ebit margin grew nearly 6.6 percentage points from a year ago to 35.1% in the March quarter. One part of this rise in Ebit and margins in research could be explained by the depreciation in the rupee. Crisil registered a forex gain of Rs.3.3 crore in January-March compared with a loss of Rs.2.67 crore in the year-ago period.The rating business didnt do that well in comparison. Segment revenues increased by 5.2% and Ebit by 10.9%. While margins improved when compared from a year ago to 33.5%, they were still lower than the December quarter numbers. The ratings business has been lagging behind the research unit for quite some time now, simply because of the economic slowdown. Lower credit growth seems to have led to lower growth in bank loan ratings. Add to this factors such as a decline in government subsidy for small and medium enterprise ratings and rising competition in this space, and there is increased pressure on the rating business.Despite that, the research segment has boosted consolidated profit growth to 40%, the best in eight quarters. While an improving economy and increasing deals will benefit this business, there is some hope for the rating segment too. Declining interest rates could very well lead to an increase in short- to medium-term debt issuance and debt refinancing.

As a producer (investor), I might have all the right ingredientsa star-studded cast, a fantastic storyline, chart-busting music scores, breathtaking sets and cinematography, and a visionary directorbut whether or not the film does well at the box office is still somewhat of a gamble. You never know whether the reagents are just right to serve up a blockbuster.Except with the Internet start-up, its even worse since there is another twistthe simple fact that there are a bunch of other start-ups with the exact same storyline! This would be akin to several independent production houses producing the same James Bond movie (since they all own the idea or franchise)at the same time and trying to bring it to the market as fast as possible. This means that there are multiple, simultaneous, identical experiments all taking place at the same time, and no one knows who will win.But wait, I hear you say; doesnt the one who is first to the market end up winning since they will have the first-mover advantage? Well, not necessarily. The me too scenario also works. And not just with the Lyfts and Olas who are replicating Uber today. History also shows us this. Yahoo was the first, true large-scale search engine. It was upended by Google, which, apart from having (at the time) a better search algorithm, also quickly added other chemical reagents to the mixfree email, Web hosting, smartphone software, smart glasses and so on. The result? Googles market capitalization, as I write this, is almost 14 times that of Yahoo$517 billion compared to Yahoos $35 billion. I remember burning my fingers by investing in Yahoo prior to the dot-com burst of 2001. The stock first fell like a stoneand then remained at the bottom of the pond for years thereafter, before staging a weak comeback afterwards. Its still around, and is still a great company, but a Google it is not. And as a footnotewhile Yahoo went public in 1996, Google didnt go public until almost eight-and-a-half years later in 2004which in Internet terms is like a day and night of Brahma8.64 billion solar years, to be precise.In the interim, Yahoo, the firm, has had several chief executivesBartz, Morse, Thompson, Levinsohn and Mayer. (That string sounds almost like the name of a white-shoe law firm.) Not so Google, where, though Indias own Sundar Pichai is now CEO, the founding team of Larry Page, Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt agreed to work together for 20 years after the IPO (until 2024). Page handed the reins over to Pichai only last year, but still remains very involved.The same analogy can be drawn with our own earlier generation of labour arbitrage-based start-ups: the technology services firms. Firms like Infosys, Cognizant and Mindtree, while sometimes criticized for the collegiality of their founding teams, have ended up having had the last laugh despite having had to weather financial crises before. All said and done, Infosyslike Cognizant, Tata Consultancy Services and some other large Indian services companies with stable management teamsis now a global champion, and Mindtree is a strong contender in the next rung.Maybe there are lessons to be learnt from this for Indias array of current start-ups, which saw a market arbitrage opportunity to enter the Internet retail space before their larger global counterparts could enter the market, essentially creating the equivalent of Jack Mas Chinese Alibaba. Flipkart and Snapdeals valuations seem to have hit a wall. Much of the publicity associated with this has been focused on the fact that foreign investors, afraid of a global slowdown and unproven business models, have written down their existing investments in the sector and are unwilling to pony up more cash. And the global market leader, Amazon, has entered the Indian market in a big way.The current bearish scenario in international markets will surely change, just as it did post-2001 and then again post-2008, so the trick is just to hold on and fend off Amazons advance until the financial tide turns. Despite recent changes in the law, Amazon is after all not an Indian firm and will face more hurdles than the home-grown rivals. But, meanwhile, instead of signing long-term agreements to work together and weather what is just a simple financial stormso that they can later go public and monetize their holdingsmany senior executives at these firms seem to be using the revolving door.Just like in the movies, you can only have one or two heroes/heroines in the cast. And the same is true of the villains. Similarly each start-up can only have one or two sultans or sultanas, but constancy in the top teams is vital. Google has its Page, Facebook its Zuckerberg, Alibaba its Ma, and Snapdeal and Flipkart have their Bahl and Bansals. But the sultans need to think of Henry Fords maxim when it comes to business: Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success. A series of cameo appearances does not a blockbuster make.Siddharth Pai is a world-renowned technology consultant who has personally led over $20 billion in complex, first-of-a-kind outsourcing transactions.",2016-04-20,ZQFsl3WTYrbJ5oGFrfBQFM,"Each start-up can only have one or two sultans or sultanas, but constancy in the top teams is vital

329,-0.239525,"The strings attached to the governments relief measures for sugar mills are becoming visible. On Wednesday, shares of sugar mills fell after news that the government may impose stock limits. This is a regressive step, moving away from decontrol, but is not a surprise altogether.
				   
				Stock limits will mean sugar in excess of the limits will be sold, leading to more supply and lower prices. The governments concern must be rising sugar prices. But they have been rising since end-September, so why the late reaction? The increase in recent months has been rapid. Since end-January, wholesale sugar prices are up by as much as 17%, while they are up by 39% since end-September. Globally, sugar prices have risen because of bad weather affecting the sugar cane crop in major producing countries such as India, Brazil and Thailand.That stress is visible in Indias output. Sugar production as of 15 April is down by 8% at 24.3 million tonnes (mt) from a year ago, says the Indian Sugar Mills Association (Isma). Whether Ismas estimate of 26 mt will be met remains to be seen, as only 117 mills are operating as of 15 April, compared with 245 a year ago. Prices may keep rising, as this situation unfolds.So what? Prices rise and fall in a free market, sugar is a decontrolled sector, and prices had been lying low for years. Why deny mills a year or two of good profit growth in a cyclical industry?The government may think it has the moral right to keep prices in check. Sugar mills in India have wrung concessions from the government, in return for paying a higher price for sugar cane. Although the Rangarajan committee has advocated linking sugar cane purchase price to the price of sugar and by-products, major sugar producing states such as Uttar Pradesh have not implemented it.Mills in Uttar Pradesh are forced to pay a state-determined price. In turn, they delay payments to farmers, leading to huge arrears, resulting in a confrontation between mills and state governments. Over the past few years, the Uttar Pradesh government has given some concessions to mills.The central government too has taken a number of measures for the sector. These include levying higher import duties on sugar, making it mandatory for oil marketing companies to procure ethanol (including fixing the purchase price), soft loans and an excise duty exemption on ethanol.The idea was to give some financial support to sugar mills, and the government even looked the other way as sugar prices rose. The government asked sugar mills to export 4 mt of sugar by September 2016. The money realized was to be used to cut down cane arrears and limit domestic supply. However, exports have been below targeted levels as domestic prices were higher. That is unlikely to have gone down well with the government. Rising sugar prices are a bigger pain. People will complain, state elections are under way and it could push up inflation as well. Maybe, the government is only sounding a warning and does not actually intend to impose stock limits. If sugar prices cool down, it may hold back. Otherwise, stock limits are just one weapon in its arsenal.In the past, the government has come down heavily on rising sugar prices. It can do so again.

13,0.2494,"This week, India finally gave up its decades-old claim on the 106-carat Kohinoor diamond, which lies in the Tower of London, guarded by Yeoman Warders  and sometimes adorns the crown of the British monarch. Or so it seemed.
				   
				The legal arguments made by the Indian governmentarising from one more court petition seeking the return of the diamondwere distinctly odd. First it was claimed that the diamond was given as voluntary compensation to the British for the expenses they bore in the Anglo-Sikh war.That is a very strange reading of history. For history shows that give and take occurs between equals. Otherwise, its one or the other.It is likely that the fabulous piece of Indian diamond was presented by Maharaja Duleep Singh, son of the great warrior king Ranjit Singh and all of eight years old, to Queen Victoria in 1850, but not personally. Amid criticism even in those politically incorrect times, governor general Lord Dalhousie wrote to a friend in 1849, My motive was simply this: that it was more for the honour of the Queen that the Koh-i-noor should be surrendered directly from the hand of the conquered prince into the hands of the sovereign who was his conqueror than it should be presented to her as a giftwhich is always a favourby any joint stock company among her subjects.By any joint stock company he meant the East India Company. This week, after raising a predictable storm, the government told the Supreme Court of its resolve to make all possible efforts to bring back the Kohinoor diamond in an amicable manner The government has not conveyed its views to the court, contrary to whats being misrepresented.Solicitor-general Ranjit Kumar told a bench led by chief justice T.S. Thakur that if we start claiming the treasures from the museums of other countries, they will claim their treasures from our museums. There will be nothing left in our museums. To which, a clearly unimpressed Thakur informed the government lawyer that India has never been a colonial power. We have not colonized any other country and taken out their artefacts. What are you worried about?Ranjit Kumar then agreed that the foreign artefacts that are in Indian museums are gifts.The arguments are expected to conclude in the days to come. Is it Indian government policy to seek the return of the Kohinoor? Previous attempts by India soon after Independence and in 1953, joined by Pakistan in 1976, were rebuffed by the British as non-negotiable.Thakur stopped short of dismissing the petition on the understandable grounds that if the court does so, it will obviously nullify any future Indian claim on the Kohinoor.Hopefully, the Indian government will spell out its case clearly once and for all. It only makes sense because the UK has told not just India, but also other countries such as Greece, that the artefacts that have ended up in the UK arent going anywhere soon.Prime Minister David Cameron couldnt have put it more clearly on a visit to India: If you say yes to one, you suddenly find the British Museum would be empty. I am afraid to say, it is going to have to stay put.However, the petitionera non-governmental organizationdoesnt just want the Kohinoor. It wants the treasures of Tipu Sultan, Bahadur Shah Zafar, Rani of Jhansi, Nawab Mir Ahmad Ali Banda and other rulers of India.Tipu? Would that include the sword of the famous Indian warrior king? No, because that would be the one that was purchased in an auction for £175,000 and returned to India by businessman Vijay Mallya. This delicious irony escaped neither the judge nor petitioner.The gentleman who bought the sword has left the country, the government attorney informed the chief justice, prompting the judge to askjokingly, we are toldwhether the United Breweries chairman had taken the sword with him.Mallyas return to Indiato face debtors whom his grounded Kingfisher Airlines owes around Rs.9,000 crore ($1.3 billion)is another matter on which India has to spell out its stand. Indian investigative agencies most certainly want him back, but they face the acute embarrassment of having to answer why they allowed him to leave the country in the first place.There is one point of view that the member of the Rajya Sabha should return voluntarily. But I know of no one who has returned to India voluntarily from the UK to face the law. Instead, what always happens is that the UK courts take over once India places its request for the UK to extradite someone (that person needs to be charged in an Indian court first).This is because a person who is resident in the UK has the legal right to fight attempts to extradite them. The government case is usually led by the home minister, who can write to the court stating the government position seeking a persons extradition. But it is up to the courtand not the governmentwhether to accept Indias request or not.Mallya, who returned Tipus sword to India, may not be quite so ready to return himself. As to the Kohinoor, there is absolutely nothing wrong with great Indian artefacts and other objects being displayed in foreign museums as long as the circumstances of their acquisition are correctly explained, a historical contextualization that will take Indian sensitivities into account. Think of the hundreds of millions of people who have been able to marvel at and enjoy the Indian objects of art and history stored and displayed in the museums of London, New York and Paris.

287,0.248675,"Reliance Industries Ltds (RILs) March quarter results were better than estimates, but only just. Its stand-alone Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) last quarter stood at Rs.10,727 crore, or about 3% higher than consensus estimates. According to a Bloomberg poll of analysts, Ebitda was estimated at Rs.10,394 crore.
				   
				In fact, some brokerage firms such as Kotak Institutional Equities had estimated Ebitda of over Rs.10,700 crore, on the back of strong margins in the petrochemicals segment. As it turns out, margins in the petrochemicals business were strong at 14%, far higher than 10.6% for the March quarter last year. Petrochemicals Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margins were higher due to strong product deltas (rate of change in prices compared with the change in unit costs) and low absolute product prices. Petrochemicals Ebit increased 29% due to strength in polymer deltas, robust polymer demand and higher volumes in the polyester chain.Besides, RILs gross refining margin (GRM) at $10.8 a barrel was marginally higher than many analysts estimates. For instance, Morgan Stanley Research and BNP Paribas Securities (Asia) Ltd were expecting GRM of $10.6 per barrel and $10.5 a barrel, respectively. While the companys GRM has declined on a sequential basis, this was expected, considering that benchmark Singapore GRM had also declined compared with the December quarter. Whats more, the company has managed to maintain its premium over Singapore GRMs at $3.5 a barrel, as in the December quarter. Strong gasoline and naphtha cracks, robust demand growth and favourable crude markets helped boost refining margins, the company said. Higher utilization rates also helped.On a consolidated basis, while RILs organized retail business has seen a smart 26% year-on-year Ebit growth, this was offset by a sharp drop in the oil and gas segment Ebit (97% year-on-year decline). The stand-alone oil and gas business reported losses at the Ebit level due to lower realization for liquids and a decline in production, while a drop in prices affected the companys US shale operations.As pointed out earlier, the results were largely on expected lines and dont do much to move the needle as far as the stocks valuations go. Currently, one RIL share trades at 11 times its estimated earnings for this fiscal year. In the near-term though, the fact that refining margin has declined may cloud sentiments for the stock. So far, quarter-to-date, Singapore GRM has averaged at $5.2 a barrel, according to an analyst, compared with $7.7 in the March quarter. Of course, it would help if petrochemical margins remain steady.However, over the medium term, the outlook for the stock may turn positive as investors start looking at higher earnings on account of RILs expansion plans. As Amit Shah of BNP Paribas writes in a recent report, the benefit of expansion of petchem capacities, pet-coke and refinery off-gas cracker projects would be visible from FY18 onwards.But on the other hand, the prospects of the telecom business remain an uncertainty. BNP, for instance, has not assigned any value to RILs telecom business in its sum-of-parts valuation.

194,0.248525,"With a 9.2% volume growth, the March quarter was a smooth ride for Hero MotoCorp Ltd, but there are bumps ahead. The positives are: Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin has expanded 3.3 percentage points from a year ago to 15.6%; and net profit has jumped 71% to Rs.814 crore. But this was no less than what investors had expected. Now, a lot rides on a good monsoon with one out of every two motorcycles/scooters being sold in rural India. Even then, any spurt in volume growth might not be evident till the harvest season. Heros management said it is looking at a low to mid-single-digit growth in the first half of the current fiscal year.
				   
				Volume growth might not also be easy to come by in the medium-term because of its relatively weaker presence in the two fastest growing categoriesscooters and premium motorcycles.Heros forte is the executive segment which comprises about 56% of the motorcycle market, but this is also the category that is increasingly being cannibalized by scooters, owing to similar price points. Still, the companys two recent launchesMaestro Edge and Duethave helped it overtake TVS Motor Co. Ltd in the last quarter, even as it increases capacity.However, the premium bike segment launch pipeline looks a little lean right now. The management said in a post-earnings conference call that work is happening in multiple segments and products, when asked about premium bikes.Any ambitious increase in exports will also take time to come simply because the conditions are not right in major export destinations for Indian two-wheeler makers.Trying to get a better toehold in the fast-growing scooter and premium bike segments might increase the companys research and development, and advertising expenses. Other expenses in the March quarter were at an eight-quarter high of 13.7% (to sales) already.The firm might have also seen its margins peaking. The commodity price meltdown has bottomed out and prices are slowly increasing. Material costs were 66% of sales in the March quarter, an almost 4 percentage point improvement from a year ago. They are only likely to rise from here on. The firm itself has guided for a sustainable Ebitda margin of 14-15%, even as it continues its cost-reduction programme.Shares of Hero are trading at 16.8 times their expected earnings for this fiscal year, a tad above their average price-to-earnings multiple.

79,0.249025,"Eicher Motors Ltds strong growth in the March quarter failed to impress investors. The stock lost steam after the company released its earnings on Thursday and closed with a marginal loss, compared with a small gain for the Nifty index.
				   
				Revenue at the consolidated level increased 46.6% from a year ago, slower than the 50%-plus growth the Street was forecasting. The miss is largely due to the commercial vehicles (CVs) divisionVE Commercial Vehicles Ltd (VECV). The business continues to see high discounts, Siddhartha Lal, Eicher Motors managing director and chief executive officer said. Add to this an unfavourable product mix and realizations fell from both the year ago and on a sequential basis, Religare Capital Markets Ltds calculations show.The silver lining is the division had one of the best quarters in recent years. Volumes are up 41% and the business gained market share in buses and medium, light and heavy duty trucks. The strong volumes led to the belief that realizations and economies of scale will see significant improvement. But contrarily, Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin at the CV division is estimated to have risen by less than a percentage point to 8%, pointing to competitive pressures. Three brokerage firms had forecast the divisions margins to expand in the range of 1.4-2.9 percentage points.The motorcycle business on the other hand lived up to expectations. Revenues at the stand-alone level jumped 60.7% on an almost similar rise in volumes. Margins expanded 3.8 percentage points to 29.9%. This helped expand consolidated margin to 17%, driving up Ebitda and net profit by 75% and 71%, respectively.Investors will do well to prepare for growth moderation in the motorcycle business. From around five months in early 2015, the waiting period for the companys popular selling model has reduced to three months now. But then, the reduction is partly explained by increased production. A production plan of 675,000 units in 2016-17 translates to a growth of 33% (based on previous year sales). Sales in 2015-16 were up 53%. The company is giving a strong push to two new modelsContinental GT and Himalayan. But the models are yet to take off in a big way. That raises question about valuations, which at 30 times the current fiscal year earnings estimate is the most expensive automobile stock to own.To be sure, Eicher continues to expand its addressable market. It plans to ramp up its Himalayan model in coming months and improve its international reach.

443,0.24615,"At one point, packaged consumer goods makers were tipped to benefit immensely from falling prices. That did not happen. Now that inflation is gearing for a comeback, consumer companies (and their investors) may wonder if they can expect a return of good times. The Wholesale Price Index (WPI)-based inflation for April rose by 0.34%, reversing a decline seen for 17 straight months (the decline had tapered in the past six months).
				   
				Why did companies not benefit so much when costs declined? This period also coincided with weakening consumption demand, with urban demand initially affected by poor economic growth and then rural demand getting hit by bad weather and falling rural wage growth.When costs decline in such an environment, larger companies fear they will lose share to smaller ones if they keep prices unchanged. This has happened before. Tough economic conditions unhinge brand loyalty quite easily, as consumers try to make every rupee count. Smaller firms are quick to respond to near-term changes in costs.Since the larger companies feared they could lose share, they passed on lower costs by way of volume discounts or price cuts. They even spent more on advertising and promotion, and even in this difficult environment endured a substantial increase in salaries (blame that on the hiring boom for e-commerce, perhaps).Cutting product prices meant that sales growth in value terms and profit growth tapered. They did report having retained customers and market share. But the pain on the profit front has been a drag on valuations. In the past one year, the S&P BSE FMCG index has been almost unchanged.Therefore, news that deflation may have become history raises the question of whether the adverse situation will neatly reverse. Crude oil prices have come off their lows, which can affect related raw and packaging material costs. Rising vegetable oil and sugar prices can affect packaged food companies. Palm oil prices have been increasing and that could see related costs for soap production rise. Note that inflation is not widespread across categories, and the monsoon rains (if they are as good as predicted) may bring food prices down. But it does seem safe to say that inflation has reversed its declining trend.So, will the larger companies hike prices now? No. Smaller firms will feel the pinch initially and possibly increase prices as their procurement costs rise. The bigger ones will wait and increase prices only when they are confident it will not affect demand. That should see sales growth exceed volume growth and eventually benefit profit growth. How soon this reflects on their performance depends on how consumers respond to a hike in product prices, when it happens.Rising inflation may not be good news for some parts of the economy, for interest rates and even disposable income. Given how the past few years have turned out, packaged consumer goods makers may welcome a bit of support from inflation.",2016-05-16,zXHxVPTlPFVkn08mNMfeUK,"As inflation gears up for a comeback, consumer companies, and their investors, may wonder if they can expect a return of good times

Compressed natural gas (CNG) volume increased 8% from a year earlier and piped natural gas (PNG) volume grew 9%. The company derives about three-fourths of its volume from the CNG business. Unfortunately, a decline in price realization for both segments meant IGLs revenue for the quarter fell 3.4% to Rs.882 crore.
				   
				However, a decline in raw material costs led to a 300 basis points (bps) expansion in operating profit margin to 22%. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The current quarter saw IGL gross spreads at Rs.9.6 per standard cu. m (scm), up 10% from a year ago and 4% higher than estimates and well above the average gross spreads of Rs.9.1 earned over FY14-H1FY16, wrote analysts from IDFC Securities Ltd in their post-result note. A strong operating profit performance and a slower rate of increase in depreciation costs helped net profit growth of 12% to Rs.108 crore.Analysts expect profit margins to improve. We expect some margin improvement from 1QFY17 onwards due to a lower CNG price cut announced by IGL post the 20% domestic gas price cut since April, pointed out analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd.More crucial would be volume growth. Even though IGLs total volume for the March quarter increased 8.4%, for financial year 2016, volume grew at a relatively slower pace of 4.4%. But the outlook seems brighter. We believe FY17/18E growth will see a much improved demand trend of ~8% versus the average of just 3% seen over FY14-16, says IDFC Securities. IGL, in particular, would benefit from the additions to Delhis state transport fleet, continuation of the odd-even scheme and the steady rate of addition of PNG connections (~100,000 households p.a.), added the brokerage.Nonetheless, its worth noting that IGL shares have outperformed.

92,-0.066375,"Reserve Bank of Indias (RBIs) asset quality review is increasingly looking like a highly successful amnesty scheme for tax evaders: come clean with your hidden income or assets (bad loans in this case), and all shall be forgiven.
				   
				Over the weekend, six state-owned banks reported a combined increase in bad loans of Rs.24,622 crore in the March quarter. This is on the back of Rs.29,538 crore reported in the December quarter; thats when the results of the RBI review became evident. The chart shows the spike for these six lenders, whose combined bad loans top Rs.1.3 trillion, in the last couple of quarters.Their stocks took a hammering and investors were left with a spate of questions.One, with the economy showing signs of improvement and even corporate earnings coming off their bottom, what explains this sudden surge in bad loans? It is not as if asset quality recognition norms have suddenly changed overnight. Clearly, bank managements till now were kicking the can down the road.In fairness, some sectors such as iron and steel and infrastructure have not had it easy for the past many years. They have been the ones repeatedly highlighted by banks as responsible for the rise in bad loans. But only when RBI releases its next financial stability report will the true extent of the rotand how widespread it is, if at allbe known.Two, has the bleeding been stanched? Is this the bottom? The answer is a resounding no.After a fashion, some of the bigger banks have started declaring asset quality watch lists. Bank of Baroda has said that it has suspect quality loans worth Rs.26,900 crore, of which 57% could potentially turn bad this financial year. While the others havent been as forthcoming, the big pile of restructured loans, those refinanced under the 5/25 scheme and loans under the strategic debt restructuring (SDR) process throw up enough red flags.Union Bank of India, for instance, has an SDR portfolio of Rs.1,840 crore, Rs.2,500 crore under 5/25 and Rs.8,500 of standard restructured assets.The net result of this car wreck is losses and the erosion in net worth. Five of these six PSU bankswith the exception of Union Bank of Indiareported losses. Together, they topped Rs.7,000 crore. (To be sure, extra provisions mandated by RBI towards Punjab food credit were also responsible for an increase in provisions).Even if the bad loan pile-up ends here, banks problems dont. Many state-owned banks have a precarious capital position. UCO Bank, for instance, has a capital adequacy ratio of 9.63% at the end of March and Central Bank of India 10.4%.

409,0.2274,"Singapore: For years now, Indias generic drugmakers and their cheap copycat pills have raised the blood pressure of storied multinationals. Increasingly, though, the challengers are getting a taste of their own medicine.
				   
				For shareholders in these once-successful Indian stocks, the prognosis looks far from reassuring. A market capitalization-weighted index of the top six producers of generic treatments has lost a quarter of its value over the past year, after jumping ninefold since April 2009.The rudest shock to the industry has come from the US Food and Drug Administration. Its issued eight warning letters to Indian drugmakers since October, hauling up companies including Sun Pharma and Dr. Reddys Laboratories, the biggest and third-biggest generic producers by market value, for infractions ranging from using buckets to collect rainwater from leaky ceilings to not doing enough to prevent possible manipulation of lab data submitted to the regulator.Since October 2015, 35% of all warning letters relating to violation of good manufacturing practices have been targeted at Indian facilities, according to Goldman Sachs. Lupin, the second-biggest Indian generic company, saw its share price tumble 9% on Friday after posting better-than-expected quarterly profit. The one-day slide, the steepest in almost eight years, was fueled by concerns that FDA approvals for products made in its key Goa manufacturing unit may not be forthcoming soon. Lupin said on an earnings call that its facilities had been inspected as many as 12 times over the past year.Still, there are at least three reasons to expect a recovery in the medium term. For one, the market for generics and biosimilars has plenty of room to grow. By the end of this decade, drugs worth $190 billion in annual sales will be going off patent, globally. Second, treatments are moving away from simple tablets and capsules to more complex applications such as injections and inhalers. Assuming that the top Indian generic drugmakers succeed in cracking the code of complexity, as Goldman analysts term it, their stalling operating margins could start expanding again.Finally, rapidly aging populations in both developed and developing countries create a powerful incentive for governments to cut public healthcare costs by promoting cheaper medicines. For instance, Japan is targeting 80% generic use between 2018 and 2020, up from 56% by volume last year. To make the most of this opportunity, the industry will first have to bring down its cost of equity, which has shot up to between 13 and 14% for the top three Indian drugmakers, up from 9 to 9.5% three years ago.The easiest way to soothe investors nerves will be for companies to stop flunking their regulatory fitness tests.

				The company said last month that the total contract value of the large deals it signed last year stood at $2.79 billion, or 45% higher compared with fiscal year 2014-15. But does this mean the companys revenue growth rate will pick up as a result? Note that HCL Technologies Ltds results in the past few quarters have demonstrated adequately that large order wins do not necessarily result in faster revenue growth. According to the company, new order wins dont translate into commensurate incremental revenues because they also contribute towards making up for earlier projects that were completed.This is a moot point. JPMorgan India Pvt. Ltd said in a note to clients: A significant portion of project-based deals come up for renewal every year; (besides), ~20-25% of annuity-deals come up for renewal/backfilling. Unless technology companies such as Infosys have a high success rate with rebids, the existing base of revenues will get eroded. As such, the new large order wins will first help in plugging the gaps that arose because of completed projects, before contributing to growth.At HCL Technologies, large order wins have amounted to over $1 billion each quarter for over 12 quarters, but revenue growth has been declining. Revenue grew by 8.1% in constant currency terms in the March quarter, about half the rate at which it grew in the April-June 2015 quarter.The JPMorgan note says, The renewal pipe is critical to fill. Winning a very high percentage of renewal deals and more crucially, winning additional business from existing clients requires sound mining/farming skills, which we believe is far more important than hunting for big contracts. Of course, all of this is not to say that Infosys lacks in client mining skills. In fact, its quite likely that the increase in order wins is the result of better mining.Even so, its clearly premature to conclude that the sharp increase in the companys deal wins will be sufficient to plug the gaps that arise from completed projects, as well as contribute handsomely to future growth.",2016-05-24,mN7y9qkZCKNeLjw9jVydFN,"The sharp pickup in Infosyss revenue growth shows clearly that it has momentum on its side

391,0.1673,"Finally, in the last quarter (March) of fiscal year 2016, things did get better for Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T), after three quarters of titanic struggle. But even as it posted a stellar operating performance that beat forecasts on revenue, profit and operating margin, order inflows remained elusive.
				   
				If order inflows are an indication of the times to come, then the 9% year-on-year drop in fresh orders during the quarter is not good news. For the 12-month period ended March 2016, the 12% dip in orders inflows fell short of even the management guidance of flat growth. Not to forget that the management had watered down its estimate from 15% at the beginning of the year. Perhaps the loss of orders in the power segment and the pathetic state of the heavy engineering, metals, and electrical and automation segments explains this drop.However, set this factor aside, and L&Ts March quarter leaves nothing for investors to crib about. Consolidated net revenue jumped by 18.3% from a year back as the companys core business segmentinfrastructureclocked 20% revenue growth. Information technology and financial services too contributed sufficiently to revenue growth.Even better was the beat on operating margin. At 14.7%, it topped the 14-broker Bloomberg consensus by 220 basis points as it raced ahead of the year-ago number by 190 basis points. A basis point is 0.01%. Again, margin outperformance came from the infrastructure segment, which more than compensated for the deplorable performance of the heavy engineering and hydrocarbons divisions. Fortunately, these comprise a small portion of the overall business of the juggernaut.Operating performance trickled down and L&T saw a 19% jump in consolidated net profit, way beyond what the Street expected.This is not all. The management, in its media address, appeared optimistic of an economic recovery both on the domestic turf and in overseas markets like West Asia, other regions of Asia and Africa. And it is still sitting on a massive order book of Rs.2.49 trillion, assuring decent revenue growth over the next three years. Some analysts say that with a sizeable chunk of international orders, the company may not be able to sustain the March quarters operating margin in the near term. Interest costs during the quarter rose from a year back, underlining the pressure on working capital.The moot question is: will the stock continue to inch up as it has done in the last three months, after a spark in the March quarter results? Sure, the stock is among the best plays on the economy and has more often than not outperformed benchmark indices.Or, will a drop in order inflows dampen investor sentiment? Yes, the management has guided for a 10-15% growth in order inflows for fiscal year 2017. What must not be ignored, however, is that fiscal year 2016 too started on a similar note but then estimates were trimmed thereafter. After all, theres still uncertainty on the fate of the monsoon, and crude oil and commodity prices, all of which impact L&Ts performance.",2016-05-26,t4LEkhjGzFvYHKkD7MJaEJ,"Even as L&T posted a stellar operating performance that beat forecasts on revenue, profit and operating margin, order inflows remained elusive

385,0.24215,"Bajaj Auto Ltd expects to ride to glory on the back of domestic motorcycle sales this year. An ebullient management has given a sales guidance of 4.6 million units in fiscal year 2017. Of this, 3 million units are supposed to be domestic sales, which translate into a hefty 40% growth. That will compensate for an expected 10% drop in export volume.
				   
				Thats a gung-ho forecast from a firm which saw its volume decline 2% in April and is absent from the fastest-growing scooters segment. In fairness, the company has also hinted at a slew of product launches in the coming months.It also hopes to reap the full-year benefits of relatively fresh product introductions such as the Avenger in October and V in March. Bajaj Auto has also revived the economy segment in motorcycles with aggressively priced vehicles such as the CT100 and CT100-B in the past couple of years. Its entry into the cargo segment of commercial vehicles too should help boost volumes.The main worry for investors is whether this aggression in introducing new models and some of them lower priced ones at that, would erode margins. So far, that hasnt happened. In the March quarter, for instance, Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin came in at 21.3%, expanding 3.6 percentage points from a year ago.Bajaj Auto improved revenue per unit of sales and it was also able to reduce its materials costs-to-sales ratio. The latter might not be possible in the coming quarters as commodity prices start inching up. Another factor that would hit margins is the lower share of exports. With major export markets facing economic slump and currency weakening, it would be a surprise if exports perform ahead of the companys guidance, even though the management says that the worst is over. In April, exports had fallen 36%.That said, the management has guided for close to 20% Ebitda margin for the current fiscal year as well. An improving product mix with more sales from Avenger, Pulsar and V too should help.A strong volume and margin guidance, and the fact that Bajaj Autos realizations went up (an indication of pricing power) were the key reasons why investors cheered up the stock 3.96% after earnings were announced. Net profit at Rs.803 crore was in line with forecasts. While the stock trades at 17.6 times expected earnings per share for this year, after Wednesdays guidance, earnings estimates are likely to be revised upwards.",2016-05-26,rteoU7WQOP5ARbiuQGcBrJ,"The main worry for investors is whether the aggression in introducing new models, and some of them lower priced ones at that, would erode margins

33,0.24785,"Early-stage investors, it would appear, have rediscovered their love for the healthcare sector. Since March, investors have concluded around 17 deals that have something or the other to do with healthcare. There may be more deals. This is based on a quick scan of the deals that have been reported by various media outlets. Still , its a substantial number that looks suspiciously like another gold rush is in the making.
				   
				Lets break down the deals to see where the money is headed. There are at least five app-based start-ups in the mix. This month, HealthifyMe, an app that enables users to track their fitness and connects them with nutritionists and trainers, picked up $6 million in a Series A round of funds from IDG Ventures India, Inventus Capital and Blume Ventures. In April, DocsApp, an app that lets patients consult with doctors, raised $1.2 million in a seed round led by Japanese venture capital firm Rebright Partners. In March, LoveCycles, a womens health and menstrual cycle tracker, raised a $700,000 round from Prime Venture Partners.It wouldnt be a surprise to see more early-stage investors make a beeline for such app-based start-ups over other categories in healthcare. The space received a big push last year when Practo, the Sequoia Capital backed start-up, raised a $90 million Series C round of funds led by Chinas Tencent Holdings. The valuation of the eight-year-old company, following the round, reportedly jumped to over $500 million.Then there are a few companies that would fall in the so-called online pharmacy category. The most well known of the lot is 1mg, which raised a $15 million Series B round led by Maverick Capital Ventures, the venture capital arm of Dallas-based hedge fund Maverick Capital, last month. Another online pharmacy that got funded last month is CareOnGo. It raised an undisclosed sum in a seed round from FAO Ventures.There are also a couple of outliers. Accel Partners recently led a Series B funding round in medical devices firm Consure Medical. It is working on faecal incontinence management technology, which is aimed at helping critical care patients among others. Earlier in March, the Indian Angel Network invested an undisclosed sum in stem cells research firm Transcell Biologics.Brick-and-mortar healthcare services firms are still not back in favour with investors, relative to the interest in the healthcare technology segments. But there has been a smattering of deals in that area, too. A couple of days ago, AddressHealth, a pediatric services healthcare chain, raised $1.5 million from Gray Matters Capital and existing investor Unitus Seed Fund. Earlier this month, dental services chain Vatsalya Centre for Oral Health raised $1.6 million from S-Squared Capital Investments.The home healthcare services segment, within the brick-and-mortar category, may become more interesting to investors soon.In January, SAIF Partners led a $4 million funding round in Care24. India Quotient, which had seed-funded the company earlier, participated in the round. There have been some big funding rounds in this business in the recent past. Last year, Portea Medical closed a $37.5 million funding round led by its existing investor Accel Partners. World Bank arm International Finance Corporation jumped in to participate, contributing $7 million to the round.The other notable deal in the segment last year was a big $10 million Series A round raised by Medwell Ventures from Fidelity Growth Partners India and Fidelity Biosciences.It isnt entirely surprising to see the heightened interest in the healthcare sector. Mint reported in March, quoting a Deloitte research report, that Indias overall healthcare market is worth $100 billion and is expected to grow at a 23% compounded annual growth rate to touch $280 billion by 2020. The report further estimates that the market for pharma e-commerce alone will grow 10 times to $400 million by 2017.The healthcare sector has also had a good run at the bourses lately, reigniting interest among investors. Last year, diagnostics services chain Dr Lal PathLabss public offering, which was subscribed more than 33 times, created profitable exits for its two private equity investorsWestBridge Capital Partners and TA Associates. Other successful public market outings include Narayana Hrudayalaya, which runs a chain of multispeciality hospitals, in December, and diagnostics labs chain Thyrocare Technologies Ltd last month. Thyrocares investors include CX Partners, Norwest Venture Partners and Samara Capital.Healthcare should be on the radar of investors, both early and later stage. Its one of those sectors that holds the key to solving massive problems in this country and offers multiple opportunities for non-linear growth. Investors just have to be careful that healthcare doesnt go the food technology way. The after-effects would be disastrous.",2016-05-27,4Yswe3cNQbyVZh3oU0dwuK,"Since March, investors have concluded around 17 deals that have something or the other to do with healthcare

392,0.19415,"Sydney: When Indias Tata Motors bought Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford in 2008, many investors thought then-chairman Ratan Tata was making a big mistake.
				   
				Ford was selling the units for less than half what it paid to acquire them, just as early tremors of the credit crisis began sapping luxury demand. The day before the deal was announced on 3 January, 2008, West Texas Intermediate crude reached $100 a barrel for the first time, suggesting a tough environment for gas-guzzling sports cars and four-wheel drives.Tatas Nano, a super-cheap one lakh rupee ($1,500) minicar pitched at Indias emerging middle class, was seen as the best prospect, and Jaguar Land Rover looked like an expensive distraction. Moodys and S&P both downgraded Tata Motors, and the stock fell almost 30% in the six months it took to complete the transaction.How have those prognostications turned out?Wrong on almost every count. Jaguar Land Rover now accounts for more than half of Tata Motors unit sales, overtaking the trucks and passenger cars produced by Tata Motors India in the past two quarters, according to annual results released Monday.Helped by a weakening rupee, Jaguar Land Rovers British-pound-denominated sales have risen more than fivefold since the takeover to Rs.2.24 trillion ($33.3 billion) in the year through March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tata Motors Indias are up a relatively modest 74%.Jaguar Land Rover is also more profitable, even after one-time costs of £224 million ($329 million) during the fourth quarter related to Takatas airbags recall and damage from the 2015 Tianjin chemicals explosions. Operating margins averaged 11% over the past five years, versus 1% in the domestic business.Hows the much-hyped Tata Nano doing? Not so well. With sales rarely rising above 2,000 units a month, the Gujarat-based factory that was set up to build it is only running at about 10% capacity. Like the netbook computers that were launched around the same time and likewise failed to change the world, its entry-level pricing couldnt quite compensate for quality that was also a bit bargain basement.Tata Motors India is now focusing its attentions on the stronger mid- and high-cost vehicle segments, and has revamped the Nano with a Rs.1.99 lakh starting price. Spare capacity in the Gujarat plant will be used to make its new Tiago, which costs Rs.3.2 lakh and upwards.What should Ratan Tatas successor Cyrus Mistry do about this situation? One option sure to delight investors would be selling the legacy Tata business to focus entirely on Jaguar Land Rover, as canvassed by Gadflys Andy Mukherjee in March. The problem there is finding a buyer for an unprofitable arm thats also more indebted than its upmarket stablemate.A better idea would be to make the best of a bad job and work at applying lessons learned from the British business. As Nissan has shown since its 1999 alliance with Renault, troubled carmakers are often only a few blockbusting designs away from success. Many investors nowadays regard Tata Motors India as an irredeemable basket case thats lurched from one crisis to another for decades. They thought the same thing of Jaguar Land Rover eight years ago.

				But so far in fiscal year 2017, there has been some optimism on oil and thats good news for Indian state-run oil producing companiesOil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL), profits of which are highly leveraged to crude oil prices. Since 1 April, the Brent crude price has increased as much as 27% to $49.69 per barrel on Wednesday. Outages in several key producing countries such as Canada and Nigeria are responsible for the recent spike in prices.While the recent strength in prices augurs well, its not as if the outlook over a medium-term perspective has turned particularly bright. We do expect some improvement in global supply-demand balance for crude oil over the next two years, said a report from Kotak Institutional Equities Research on Tuesday. They forecast global crude oil price at $50 a barrel for FY2017 and $55 a barrel for FY2018, according to the report.For now, lower crude oil prices have meant disappointing net price realizations for the quarter gone by. ONGC and OILs net realizations came in at $34.88 a barrel and $32.62 a barrel, respectively. Further, the production performance wasnt impressive either. ONGCs crude oil production fell 2% year-on-year while its gas production declined at a faster pace of 10%. Sure, OILs gas production increased 8% year-on-year but it has declined 7.5% compared with the December quarter. OILs crude oil production declined both sequentially as well as compared with the year ago period.Shares of both companies have understandably lagged the benchmark Sensex in the past year owing to low prices. Currently, ONGC and OIL stocks trade at 11 times and 10 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year, respectively. What of the future? Says Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd, while the recent strength in oil is positive, upsides for ONGC and OIL may not be high, as cess burden (now calculated at 20%) will increase and the risk of subsidy sharing remains. Also, a sharp 20% cut in the domestic gas price will offset some of the oil price gains, pointed out analysts from Nomura in their March quarter results review, adding that they expect a further 17% cut in the gas price from 1 October.

249,0.248425,"Infosys Ltd has lagged peers on revenue and profit growth in six of the past seven years. But even when its competitive position rapidly deteriorated, it held on to the pole position for one important metriccash flow generation.
				   
				In the past seven years, cash flow from operations amounted to 23.3% of revenues for Infosys, compared to 19.8% in the case of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and 16.2% for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. But, as is well known, Infosys has lagged considerably in terms of shareholder returns during this period. Cash may be king, but it is clearly no emperor. Investors far prefer strong growth accompanied by a reasonable amount of cash generation to exceptional cash generation accompanied by sluggish growth.Is TCS now falling into the same trap? Its growth rate has fallen considerably and cash flow generation has improved in recent years. It has closed the gap with Infosys considerably in terms of cash generated from operations19.3% of revenues in FY16 versus 19.6% for Infosys. Besides, it has curtailed capital expenditure. As a result, it has overtaken Infosys in free cash flow generation in the past two years. The amount spent by TCS on capital expenditure and acquisitions accounted for just 12.5% of cash flow from operations in the past two years, compared to 28.7% in the case of Infosys.Should investors be worried? According to an analyst with a multinational brokerage firm, the company has chosen the organic route to invest for the future, compared to some of its peers who have preferred acquisitions to plug gaps in their portfolio. Analysts at JPMorgan India Pvt. Ltd said in note to clients after attending an 18 March analysts meet, We came away with an enhanced appreciation of TCSs digital capabilities and conclude that its lack of M&A in digital does not necessarily mean lack of capabilityit is strongly building the needed, differentiating digital strengths organically.Another reason cash flow generation has improved in recent years is that the company has reduced its exposure to some emerging markets such as India. Working capital needs are typically higher in these regions, and the lower exposure has meant that overall cash generation has improved. Both of the above points suggest that growth isnt necessarily being sacrificed. Of course, it remains to be seen if TCSs plan to grow organically helps it catch up with peers soon.Thankfully for Infosyss shareholders, its new leadership has made growth a priority. The company even beat TCS on revenue growth in fiscal year 2015-16. M&A (mergers and acquisitions) activity has picked up, indicating that it is getting bolder with its use of cash. And cash flow from operations fell to below 20% of revenues last year, compared to around 24% in the preceding three years.

171,0.07115,"Shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd rose by around 2.5% in early trading on Wednesday on news that the Telecom Commissions new formula for spectrum usage charge will result in lower costs for some telcos. But by the end of the trading session, the shares gave up more than half of those gains, as it became clear that cost savings will be immaterial. 
				   
				Mint reported earlier this week that Bharti Airtels spectrum usage charge is expected to come down to 3.74% of gross revenue, from 4.9% currently. The cost savings would have been meaningful, although the commission also said that aggregate charges would have to match payments made by telcos in fiscal year 2015-16. In other words, there will be no near-term benefits from the move. From a policy perspective, however, the commissions decisions on spectrum usage charges are heartening. The government is known to eke out maximum revenues from the sector. By capping spectrum usage charges at FY16 levels and agreeing to a lower (3%) charge for future spectrum auctions, there appears to be a slight shift in its stance. Of course, this alone isnt enough to move the needle. Investors in the telecom sector will like to see similar forbearance when it comes to pricing of spectrum in the auctions. Earlier this year, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India recommended an auction of 700 megahertz (MHz) spectrum with a recommended reserve price of $8.5 billion for a 5MHz block. At the time, Kotak Institutional Equities said that bids for 700MHz spectrum would cause irreparable damage to the industry. A company such as Idea Cellular Ltd, for example, would need to pay $4 billion just for its eight leadership circles. This would increase its already high debt levels by over 70%. The government has shown no sign of toning down its expectations. In the budget for 2016-17, it has factored in receipts of Rs.55,000 crore from fresh sale of spectrum. In other words, it expects bids worth more than Rs.2 trillion in the coming auctions in order to receive an upfront payment of Rs.55,000 crore. In the March 2015 auction, telcos had paid around 26.5% of the total value of spectrum as upfront payment. In this backdrop, its clearly premature to read too much into the softening of the governments expectations on spectrum usage charges.",2016-06-09,O2Nd5SwQzirKfm8P9ZSjFO,"It is premature to read too much into the softening of the governments expectations on spectrum usage charges

				In fact, InterGlobe Aviation Ltds (IndiGos) results met the guidance they had given in February which had already tapered Street expectations. IndiGos earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and lease rentalsor Ebitdarrose 7% from a year ago to Rs.1,505 crore, translating into an Ebitdar margin of 36.8% that was steady compared with a year ago and two percentage points lower sequentially.Meanwhile, SpiceJet Ltd had reported many adjustments in maintenance costs, re-delivery expenses and other income. Adjusting for all of that, Ebitda and Ebitdar at Rs.220 crore and Rs.460 crore, respectively, signify a strong operating performance, points out Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers Ltd.
Jet Airways (India) Ltds standalone Ebitdar jumped to Rs.1,361 crore last quarter from Rs.1,227 crore and Rs.196 crore in the December and March 2015 quarters, respectively. As expected, all three firms reaped the benefits of the lower crude price environment. In fact, fuel costs as a percentage of revenue dropped to as low as 25%, 20.6% and 22.7%, respectively, for IndiGo, Jet Airways and SpiceJet. Whats more, lower fuel costs also enabled Jet Airways and SpiceJet to report a profit for the year as a whole, too. IndiGo, on the other hand, saw a 53% growth in its net profit for fiscal 2016.Going ahead, the fact that traffic data is healthy is encouraging. According to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, passengers carried by domestic airlines in January-April 2016 rose 23%, compared with last year. We expect Indias passenger volume growth to remain strong in FY17-18E (expect 20% CAGR, or compounded annual growth rate) as ticket prices are unlikely to increase sharply (in line with our outlook on fuel costs) and economic growth momentum is likely to improve, says Kotak Institutional Equities.But crude prices are showing signs of strength.

				At the industry level, the brunt of this investment slowdown is seen in the financials and order books of capital goods makers. In the March quarter, the revenue of the top seven capital goods makers grew 5% from a year ago, which was a surprise. However, their aggregate order inflows fell 2%, according to data from Kotak Institutional Equities. Larsen and Toubro Ltd missed its order inflow guidance of 0-5% growth for fiscal 2016. In the March quarter, orders fell 9%. Crompton Greaves Ltds domestic business and ABB Ltd didnt fare much better.Things havent improved in the current quarter as well. The manufacturing sectors purchasing manager index (PMI) for May shows capital goods orders and production growth continue to fall. There is excess capacity (look no further than the power generation industry) in many sectors and firms are repairing leveraged balance sheets and selling non-core assets to stay afloat.With global growth also not in a rosy shape, and the Middle East, a key market for Indian capital goods makers, battling low oil prices, there is no confidence that foreign orders will save the day.Whats more worrying is that even the current order book might not lead to revenue growth. Take Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltds (Bhels) management guidance for instance. It said that of the current order backlog of Rs.1.1 trillion, at least Rs.50,000 crore worth projects are either slow-moving or stressed, according to a note from Religare Securities Ltd. Overall, the weak financials of client firms and the all-too-familiar problems of land and fuelwhich still affect many projectsdepress the outlook for revenue growth in the current fiscal.For Bhel, this translates into a shrinking of sales in FY17, compared with the previous year; in turn, leading to more margin pressure. Other firms, too, face margin pressure. As energy and commodity prices have resumed their climb, the margin kick from lower input costs will also wear away.Unless demand and order inflows perk up, there is no way to justify the rise in the stock prices of capital goods makers. The BSE Capital Goods Index has risen 12.7% since the start of this fiscal (till 2 June), compared with 6% for the Sensex.

396,-0.247775,"The March 2016 quarter will go down as one of the worst in the history of Indian banks as losses piled up and bad loans tumbled out of their cupboards. The five key takeaways are:
				   
				1) The central bank-instituted asset quality reviews full blast was spread over the second half of the year. Indian lenders added Rs.1.4 trillion in bad loans over the course of January to March. This comes on the back of Rs.97,404 crore bad loans addition in the December quarter. All said, gross bad loans for listed banks stood at Rs.5.8 trillion at the end of March, or about 8% of non-food credit. For state-owned banks, this ratio hovers close to 10%. This doesnt include restructured assets, which in many cases, would add half as much more to their stressed loans portfolio.2) The surge in bad loans was not restricted to public sector banks. Even big private lenders such as Axis Bank Ltd and ICICI Bank Ltd saw a sharp rise in bad loans, indicating that the rot runs deep. Whats more, the clean-up is not complete. Many banks have declared watch lists of assetsa good percentage of which they expect to go bad this year. For Axis, this was around Rs.22,000 crore and ICICI Rs.52,000 crore. Among state-run lenders, State Bank of India has declared Rs.31,000 crore worth of loans sensitive and Bank of Baroda about 27,000 crore.3) This big pile-up of bad loans necessitated higher provisions. Over the course of the year, banks had to set aside some Rs.1.75 trillion towards bad loans. Thus, the listed universe of banks in India ended up with losses of Rs.14,685 crore in the March quarter. This number is boosted by private bank profits. The combined losses of state-owned banks were higher at Rs.23,493 crore after a Rs.10,793 crore loss in October-December.4) These losses meant net worth got hit. For 25 state-run banks for whom data was available, net worth fell by Rs.65,350 crore, or 11.5%, in the six months to March. While the central bank had relaxed some provisions for recognizing capital, this kind of continued losses will start affecting their prudential ratios. For about one in three banks, stressed assets (net bad loans plus one-third of restructured loans) are higher than their net worth.5) With a precarious capital position, banks will find it difficult to expand lending.

290,0.247475,"Cement firms had a good March quarter. The combined operating profit for the 23 big cement firms grew 15% from a year ago. It had nothing to do with the base effect, too; operating profit grew 7.8% in March 2015.
				   
				The impetus for this growth came from the southern marketsmainly from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, where a new capital is coming up. A healthy pick-up in infrastructure projectsmostly government wardsalso led to an increase in cement demand. Thus, south India-based cement firms such as India Cements Ltd and Ramco Cement Ltd gained more. The latters operating profit margin soared to an industry high of 31% in the March quarter.Overall, cement shipments grew nearly 11% from a year ago in the March quarter. The big question now is whether this is a one-off or sustainable?The consensus seems to be saying fiscal 2017 will tend to be better than the previous year. This would be largely driven by the governments increased public spending and initiatives such as housing for all, smart cities mission and a dedicated freight corridor.But thats not saying much.Nobody expects the real estate sector to turn around. So, there is unlikely to be any significant demand in housing. Both rural and urban housing demand is likely to remain muted in FY17. The governments infrastructure push would not be adequate to sustain this demand; private investment also must rise.Overall, India Ratings Ltd see cement demand growing 4-6% in FY17. Cement firms themselves anticipate a 6-8% rise. All this again depends on a good monsoon after two years of drought.The margins also may not be sustainable. In the immediate quarter, the input costs may remain under check, but energy and commodity prices have already started to climb. Secondly, given the overcapacity in the industry, cement firms dont seem to have much pricing power, too. Yes, there was a strong increase in cement prices in the March quarter; but after that, the hikes have been muted. All-India average cement prices have improved merely by around 1% month-on-month, said a Reliance Securities note. For prices to rise further, a substantial improvement in demand is needed.

277,-0.24315,"Microsofts move to purchase LinkedIn for $26.2 billionthe largest company-for-company acquisition in the technology industry since Hewlett Packards 2002 purchase of Compaqis bringing out the predictable talk of irrational exuberance. But if the deal does indicate a bubble, its not necessarily in tech or in stocks.
				   
				First, the combination actually makes sense on many levels. The companies both cater to older, corporate users, and have similar missions, with Microsoft seeking to enable people and businesses throughout the world to realize their full potential, and LinkedIn to connect the worlds professionals to make them more productive and successful. Putting the two together could allow for some significant cost savings: Microsoft could economize a lot simply by imposing some discipline on LinkedIns profligate use of stock-based compensation, which the social-networking company has forecast at about $580 million in 2016, on revenues of between $3.65 and $3.7 billion.Second, this isnt a typical stock-market-bubble deal. In such transactions, a company with an inflated stock price issues equity to fund the purchase of another company with an inflated stock price, often driving the prices of both companies higher on some kind of 1 + 1 = 3 logic. Microsoft, by contrast, is paying for the deal in cash. The stock market, for its part, has initially reacted pessimistically: Microsofts market valuation has fallen more than LinkedIns has risen, leaving the combined entity worth less than the individual companies were on Friday.For a better sense of where the bubble might be, consider how Microsoft is raising the cash to fund the deal. The money will come entirely from new bond issues, adding about $25 billion to a debt load that has already increased by about $15 billion over the past year:Corporate debt issuance has surged since the 2008 financial crisis for a variety of reasons, including central banks easy-money policies, low or negative interest rates in much of the developed world and foreign central banks more recent moves to purchase corporate bonds directly. In the US, corporate bonds outstanding amounted to 27% of gross domestic product as of March 2016, up from 20% at the end of 2007:To be sure, some of the debt issuance is a form of tax arbitrage: instead of incurring tax liabilities by bringing in cash from abroad to pay for stock buybacks, US tech and pharmaceutical companies are instead borrowing the money at home. That said, when a source of funding is too cheap it will be abused, and excess issuance is generally a big danger sign, whether it involves tech IPOs in the late 1990s, mortgage debt in the middle 2000s, energy debt in the early 2010s or corporate debt today.

222,-0.23175,"Over the last fortnight, capital goods giant Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (Bhel) has been in the news as it has commissioned several thermal units. For the year ended 31 March 2016, the firm also boasts the highest number of projects commissioned in the last five years. Whats more, it has an order book that is four times its trailing annual revenue. Simply put, it means that Bhels Rs.1.1 trillion order book is enough to generate revenue for the next four years.
				   
				But all this has mattered little to investors. In the past year, the companys stock is down by over 50%. Why?Nearly half of Bhels orders are from the power sector, where projects are stranded for want of clearances. Obviously, projects are moving at a slow pace, leading to cost overruns.On the industrial side, too, clients are in no hurry to get projects off the ground. Recent macroeconomic data echoes the same. Manufacturing activity in the country is down and gross fixed capital formation during the March quarter contracted from a year ago by 1.9%, making it the lowest in two years.Besides, analysts concede that most of the recent orders were at low margins because of the stiff competition in the industry. All these factors mean that there will be challenges to revenue and profit traction.The companys March quarter performance bears testimony to this. Revenue declined by 22% year-on-year and operating margin at 3.6% was way below 7% that the Street had forecast. The management too appears worried about such projects. The quarters profit was below expectation partly due to provisions made towards doubtful debts and liquidated damages.Thats not all. The next three years may be challenging for order inflows too. Data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy paints a rather gloomy picture for power equipment manufacturers. The annual plant load factor for Indias thermal and nuclear power stations is down from 78% in fiscal year 2008 to about 62% in FY16. Whats worse is that the peak energy deficit is also dropping, indicating that there is no demand for power. These circumstances undermine the need for more power capacity. According to a note by Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd, Bhel accounts for about two-thirds of the industrys power equipment capacity of 30 GW (gigawatts), whereas order inflows over the next two to three years, is unlikely to cross 12-15 GW. This implies stiff competition and weak pricing power, impairing profit margins.Given these challenges, it is not surprising that a huge order backlog and a steep 55% jump in order inflows, even in the recent March quarter, failed to cheer investors and power the stock. Macro challenges are likely to tell on Bhels profitability and are too steep to tide over in the near term.",2016-06-17,UBdHphJekVbJ3r5NQvAYJO,"In spite of an order book of Rs1.1 trillion, analysts see challenges to Bhels revenue and profit traction

58,0.171925,"The Cabinet has approved the spectrum auction plan recommended by the department of telecommunication. The value of the spectrum that is being put up for the auction is more than Rs.5 trillion, based on the proposed reserve price. Hardly anyone expects telecom companies to bid for the entire spectrum; although based on past experience, with Indian telecom firms, you can never say never.
				   
				About three-fourths of the total spectrum on offer, in value terms, is in the 700 megahertz (MHz) band. Telecom firms such as Bharti Airtel Ltd have said that the pricing makes it unaffordable. Also, if the government has managed to make contiguous blocks of 1800MHz spectrum available in the auction, the demand for spectrum in the 700MHz band will naturally be low.Most importantly, the sectors debt is already at monumental levels and based on leverage metrics such as debt/Ebitda, there is hardly any leeway in terms of taking on much additional debt. As such, the Rs.4 trillion worth 700MHz spectrum should ideally be left untouched.Even so, some telecom firms may still explore bidding in a few circlessuch as B and C circles where pricing of this spectrum is not as expensive vis-à-vis other bands. If bidding is restricted to these circles, investors will be largely unconcerned. But if extends to other circles, and telecom firms get bold as they have in some previous auctions, investors have much to worry.As pointed earlier in this column, the governments approach leaves much to be desired. It seems to be least bothered about the financial health of the industry, and is treating it as a golden goose.Of course, the government cant be entirely blamed when telcos themselves have been reckless while bidding in past auctions.

True, investors expect Mahanagar Gas Ltds initial share sale to unlock value for GAIL, which is selling 12.5% stake in the city gas distributor. However, in the overall scheme of things, it may not amount to much. For perspectiveat the higher end of the price band of Rs.380-421 per share, GAIL will fetch about Rs.520 crore through the offer for sale while its market capitalization on Thursday was Rs.47,618 crore. Also, at Rs.421 per share, GAILs remaining 32.5% stake is valued at around Rs.1,350 crore, hardly moving the needle.
				   
				Nevertheless, investors have reason to rejoice. So far this fiscal year, the share price has increased 10% from a closing low of Rs.340 at the beginning of April. A recovery in its petrochemicals business is on the cards. Overall, fiscal year 2016 was a challenging one. Stand-alone pre-tax and one-time earnings declined by a fourth from a year earlier to Rs.3,173 crore. The petrochemicals business has been a major source of pain what with the segment posting earnings before interest and taxes (Ebit) loss of Rs.807 crore in FY16. Performance was impacted on account of lower sales volume and weaker prices.However, the business is expected to swing to profit this year. The re-negotiation of RasGas long-term LNG (liquefied natural gas) contract at lower prices is expected to reduce raw material costs, helping petrochemicals performance. GAIL has commissioned its petrochemical plant expansion in Pata (Uttar Pradesh) with capacity of 0.4 million tonnes per annum or MMPTA (taking total capacity to 0.81 MMPTA). Accordingly, the segment should also benefit from a gradual ramp up in volume. Further, if crude oil prices continue to rise, an improvement in petrochemicals prices can be expected.Also Read: Mahanagar Gas IPO gets subscribed 64.51 times

344,0.2488,"In 2015, Indian Internet and e-commerce companies received funding worth $5.8 billion from private investors, according to research firm Venture Intelligence. In the same period, Amazon.com Inc. reported operating cash flow of $11.9 billion. Free cash flow (FCF), after deducting capital expenditure, stood at $7.3 billion.
				   
				And while funding from private investors has decelerated considerably since the fourth quarter of 2015, it looks like Amazon has upped the tempo with cash flow generation. In 2015, its free cash flow jumped 284%.Should Indian e-tailers just throw in the towel? According to an analyst with a domestic institutional broker, its an uneven playing field. Cash is becoming a scarce resource for home-grown companies, while Amazon appears to be flush with cash.But appearances can be deceiving. Amazons FCF, on a closer look, is nowhere near $7.3 billion. More than half of its capital expenditure is done by purchasing property and equipment using leases. If the purchases had been made outright, FCF would reduce by $5.2 billion. At the least, principal repayments for these leases should be reduced, in which case FCF would reduce by $2.6 billion. Then, the company regularly makes acquisitions, and adjusting for this would reduce FCF by another $800 million. A look at the chart alongside shows how far removed Amazons adjusted FCF is vis-à-vis FCF derived from the traditional calculation. In 2015, free cash amounts to only around $1.3 billion after making these adjustments, less than a fifth of what headline numbers suggest.Also Read: Would you buy a policy or a fund on Flipkart or Paytm?

Some analysts also suggest adjusting for stock-based compensations ($2.1 billion), stating that this should be viewed as normal cash wages, which is how employees see them. But that may be taking things too far. The fact remains that stock-based compensations are a non-cash expense, and thanks to Amazons premium valuations ($336 billion), they result in negligible equity dilution.Even so, Amazon isnt as flush with cash as some perceive. Why else would its long-term debt and other long-term liabilities (leases etc.) rise to $18.2 billion at the end of December 2015, from $15.7 billion a year before that. The value of cash and marketable securities rose from $17.4 billion to $19.8 billion; but adjusted for long-term liabilities, theres not all that much cash left to speak of.Besides, the company continues to invest heavily in established markets, largely on its cloud computing services initiative, Amazon Web Services. So its not like Amazon has firmly rooted itself in developed markets, and now has the luxury of using all its cash to conquer emerging markets such as India. Indeed, a clear sign that it is far from being well established in its main markets is the widening deficit between its shipping revenue and shipping costs. The deficit stood at $5 billion, $4.2 billion and $3.5 billion in the past three years5% of net sales in each of the years. This is hardly a sign of a company raking in the money. Instead, Amazon continues to underprice some of its services even in markets where it is well established. In the process, it is sacrificing profit margins as well as cash flow in order to grow revenues and establish customer loyalty. Yet, having said all this, Amazon India is still miles ahead of counterparts such as Flipkart when it comes to funding. The latter are utterly dependent on private investors to fund their cash burn. If the current ebb in funding continues, they will struggle to survive. Amazon, on the other hand, can raise $6 billionmore than what all Indian e-commerce and Internet companies raised last yearby selling less than 2% of its equity.Also Read: Flipkart gets tougher with its sellers

One hope for Indian e-tailers will be that public investors start acting tough with Amazon, and force it to be less profligate, just as private investors have with them.

Investors are still buying into his pitch of building revenues now and profits coming in later. Some of them are clearly buying into the cash flow generation story.As pointed out earlier, Indian e-tailers neednt be overawed by Amazons seemingly huge free cash flow.

				Utility vehicle (UV) sales, within the auto segment, are growing at a robust pace. The demand for farm equipment is expected to get better soon on the back of a normal monsoon. Its Korean unit, too, is clocking reasonable sales numbers.The March quarter has reignited hope for the M&M stock. A host of new launches in the passenger vehicle segment made up for lost market share, at least partly, in the UV segment. Note that the company faced bad times in this segment for about eight quarters, with UV sales plummeting as increasing diesel prices and higher duties turned away customers.Add to this, M&M was caught on the back foot as foreign automobile firms flooded the markets with compact UVs, a segment that M&M did not brace itself for.Further, farm equipment sales that have languished, thanks to weak demand after deficit rains for two consecutive years, are inching up.During the March quarter, the companys sales were 15% more than a year ago in the auto segment and 13% in the farm equipment business. Pent up demand with better prospects for farming should rev up tractor sales, in the coming months.A higher farm share in M&Ms product mix will boost the companys operating margin.That said, the downside risk to profit margins comes from rising raw material costs and marketing expenses to combat competition.Besides, M&Ms initiative to have petrol variants for its vehicles will take time to establish in the market.Its portfolio is predominantly diesel-driven, which itself is a threat to sales growth, given the ban on large diesel passenger vehicles in some states and the losing cost edge versus the petrol ones.In any case, the Street has charted out a 15-16% revenue growth for M&M, including its unit, Mahindra Vehicle Manufacturers Ltd, during FY17. This is good news as it comes after a revenue contraction in FY15 and a low single-digit growth in FY16.Meanwhile, Ssangyong Motor Corp., its South Korean subsidiary, clocked two consecutive quarters of operating profit, which is valuation accretive.All this optimism across business segments has taken the stock up by about 15% since the beginning of April.However, at the current market price of Rs.1,390, M&Ms shares are trading close to their five-year highs as the Street was quick to price in the positives in the firm.",2016-06-27,aRHI5y9K9P3aEleFzf9jRL,"In the March quarter, the companys sales were 15% more than a year ago in the auto segment and 13% in the farm equipment business

225,-0.0621,"Call it crony capitalism or any other term you wish. Large borrowersand significantly the top 100 largest debtorsare primarily responsible for the bad loan problem in Indian banks. Thats the inescapable conclusion from the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBIs) June financial stability report.
				   
				Consider chart 1: The share of large borrowers in total gross non-performing assets (NPAs) has increased to 86.4% at the end of March. Their share in loans is only 58%. Large borrowers are described by RBI as those who have aggregate fund-based and non-fund based exposure of at least Rs.5 crore. Their share of gross bad loans has increased faster than their share of total bank credit over the past year.Even among large borrowers, it is the largest, the top 100 entities, who are responsible for the sharp deterioration seen following the central banks asset quality review.Consider chart 2: The gross bad loans of the top 100 borrowers, among the largest corporate groups in the country, have jumped to 22.3% of bad loans of large borrowers, up from 0.8% a year ago. Put it another way, these top 100 borrowers account for 19.3% of all bank bad loans at the end of March compared with 0.7% a year ago.That, of course, leads to the question: whats the reason for the sudden spike in bad loans? If anything, economic growth has been improving according to official figures.The answer lies in chart 3.Large borrowers have been enjoying the fruit of banks forbearance for quite some time. After the central banks asset quality review, lenders have been forced to reveal all these skeletons and re-classify them as NPAs. As chart 3 shows, there has been a sharp decline in advances classified as SMA-2 and restructured standard. SMA-2, or special mention account-2, are those accounts where principal or interest payment was overdue between 61 days and 90 days.The decline in these two categories is almost equal to the rise in gross bad loans. That there is still more pain to come is reflected in the 35% increase in assets classified as SMA-1 (principal or interest overdue between 31 days and 60 days), which is an early signal of stress in asset quality.",2016-06-29,URelrQgfpNPeGpDsnIs0xN,"Large borrowers, and significantly the top 100 largest debtors, are primarily responsible for the bad loan problem in Indian banks, says RBIs June financial stability report

308,0.21595,"The first repercussions of the impending departure of Raghuram Rajan from the Reserve Bank of India could now be visibleand it looks like those who argued the independence of Indias central bank was under threat may have been right.
				   
				Indias aspirations
Rajan declared last month that he would not be seeking the expected extension of his terma move widely seen as being forced on him by the Narendra Modi-led government in New Delhi, which had publicly disagreed with several of his decisions and statements as governor. This was troubling. The government appeared to be uncomfortable with its inability, under Rajan, to direct the central banks actions. The implications for the RBIs institutional stability and strengthand for the credibility of India as an investment destinationwerent good.Some of Rajans latest speeches suggest the government is close to knocking a further hole in the RBIs authority. The governor has spoken out against a suggestion, which is gathering force in New Delhi, to use surplus funds with the RBIits contingent reserve, set aside for emergenciesto recapitalize stressed state-owned banks.The governments motivations are understandable. It has committed itself to a pretty stringent path of fiscal consolidation over the next few years, one that would bring the fiscal deficit down to 3% of gross domestic product. However it has to do this at the same time as Indian banksin particular, the state-controlled banks that comprise 70% of the sectorare dealing with a full-blown bad loans crisis. Estimates of bad loans vary widely, but may total anywhere between six and 12% of GDP. The RBI itself estimates they may hit 8.5% of GDP by next March.Recapitalizing the banks is urgentthey need about $140 billion in capital by 2019, according to Fitch Ratingsbut the government has set aside very little money to do so as yet. And soon after the next federal budget is presented at the end of February 2017, Modis government will probably go into election mode. Polls are due in 2017 in the crucial northern state of Uttar Pradesh, and the next general elections will be just two years away at that point. Its obviously tempting to use the RBIs funds instead of finding money from the general budget.Such a move would reverse years of institutional evolution at the central bank. The RBI used to own significant stakes in some major Indian banksa conflict of interest for the central bank, which regulates the banking sector. Even though a government-appointed committee recommended as early as 1998 that these shares be sold, it wasnt till 2010 that the sale actually took place. Rajans fear is that the current administration wants to reverse this processand hes right, doing so would be disastrous.Other bad ideas for plundering the RBIs reserves have been floated before. In 2004, some ministers wanted to tap $5 billion a year from the surplus fund to finance Indias infrastructure-building program. Fortunately, the RBIwith some timely help from the International Monetary Fundmanaged to hold off the government, greatly enhancing its reputation for independence. (Its worth noting that in this, it did better than the US Federal Reserve, which wasnt able to stave off a law passed by the US Congress last December that dipped into its surplus to pay for US highways.)An attempt to use the RBIs rainy-day cash pile would not just dent the central banks independence, but also the credibility of Indias already shaky fiscal arithmetic. It would make accounting for the exact amount that the government was spending impossible, as well as have unpredictable effects on inflation. It would thus vastly set back the RBIs efforts under Rajan to establish a reputation as an inflation-fighting central bank.Worryingly, the governments apparent willingness to compromise RBI independence seems in keeping with several of its recent decisions. The controversial departure of Rajan is one such. The purpose was presumably to replace him with a choice with whom the government is more comfortable, perhaps its chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian, who first suggested dipping into RBI funds in his annual economic survey earlier this year.The fact that the government has chosen to ignore the obvious means of recapitalizing banks is also revealing. The state-owned banking sector shouldnt be bailed out using RBI funds, of coursebut not by using tax money either. Instead, it should be guided towards privatization, and funds for recapitalizing the best banks should be raised from the markets. But movement on this is slow. Modi himself doesnt seem too sympathetic to privatization.Indias prime minister came into office promising maximum governance, minimum government. Thats what both the RBI and the banking sector need, not renewed state control.

348,0.2448,"In May, a government of India Press Information Bureau release stated that the ministry of urban development had directed state governments to convert census towns to urban local bodies to allow for planned development and efficient service provision. Census towns are areas that are governed by village panchayats but are recognized by the census of India as being urban. This mismatch leads to a host of problemsfrom misallocation of resources to unsafe development of densely populated clusters. Much of India has long left her villages, and it is a welcome sign that the government is starting to acknowledge this. But the extent of urbanization in India is still widely underestimated. Urbanization has an important role to play in a countrys economic growth and so it is critical to get it right.
				   
				According to the 2011 census, there are 3,894 census towns spread across states. Maharashtra paid heed to the ministrys notice and recently granted urban local body status to 19 census towns in the Pune region.The ultimate decision to convert census towns to statutory urban local bodies rests with state governments. Municipal laws in some states specify guidelines such as population and density thresholds for notifying areas as urban local bodies, but these guidelines vary widely. For instance, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra have population thresholds of 30,000 and 25,000, respectively, for classifying an area as urban, whereas states such as Kerala and Punjab have no such criteria. Moreover, these guidelines are not binding and state governments can exercise discretion in notifying areas.An IDFC Institute paper by these authors along with Mudit Kapoor found that only 26% of India is governed by urban local bodies as of 2011. The rate varies across states with small hill states such as Mizoram (37%), Nagaland (26%) and Manipur (25%) surprisingly having a higher percentage of its population governed as urban than larger states such as West Bengal (23%), Bihar (11%) and Kerala (16%).Having differing and flexible guidelines makes sense given the heterogeneity across states. But differing guidelines are only meaningful if they are able to capture the true urban and rural characteristics of places across states. In our study cited, we found that this is not the case. At the state level, we found that the extent of areas governed as urban has a weak relationship with income, poverty and population working in non-agricultural activities, all of which are thought to be correlates of urbanization.In an opinion piece in this newspaper (Chasing definitions in India

), we argued that the official modes of recognizing urban areas in India underestimate the true extent of urbanization.Using the census definition, India is 31% urban. But we found that if we apply Ghanas definition of urban, India is 47% urban, and if we apply Mexicos definition, India is 65% urban. The differences in urbanization rates are even starker at a subnational level. For instance, Kerala is an anomaly and goes from being around 16% urban as per the administrative definition to over 99% urban using Ghanas and Mexicos definitions.Following the news of the central governments directive to convert census towns to urban local bodies, a national newspaper reported that the secretary of local self-government in Kerala, A.P.M. Mohammed Hanish, suggested that the minimum population threshold to upgrade areas to an urban status should be increased to 25,000a benchmark that is so high that no country uses it in its urban definition to the best of our knowledge. He stated, If the parameters prescribed by the Union ministry were strictly followed, there may not be any panchayat left in the state. This corresponds exactly to our findings of Kerala already being almost completely urban when we apply other definitions. It also emphasizes the reluctance of state governments to recognize that urbanization is a reality.This desire to stay rural may stem out of perceived advantages that are enjoyed by rural areas, such as access to funding through rural development schemes or lower taxes. However, these advantages may not necessarily exist. In our study, we investigated whether areas that are urban in nature but governed by panchayats make disproportionately more use of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, but found no evidence to support this conjecture. Thus, while staying rural may not confer the benefits some imagine they will receive, the real losers from the state governments actions are the de facto urban areas that are deprived of the benefits of planned development and amenities and services provided to officially urban settlements.India cannot afford to govern its settlements in such an arbitrary manner, and the ministry of urban developments move is one in a series of many steps required to address the lacunae in the current rural-urban categorization system, prevent misallocation of resources, provide efficient services and governance structures, and leverage the ongoing structural transformation to boost economic development.India is more urban than we think. Finally, policymakers are coming round to reckoning with this reality.Comments are welcome at

441,-0.242825,"A day after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) released its biannual Financial Stability Report, outlining the significant challenges being faced by Indian banks, 31 of 33 big banks in the US cleared the final round of the Federal Reserves annual stress tests, signifying the resilience of the US financial system.
				   
				Only one of the largest banks of the USMorgan Stanleygot a conditional passing grade and two others, Deutsche Bank AG and Santander Bank NA, both US subsidiaries of European banks, failed. In the previous year too, the duo did not qualify.The stress tests essentially gauge whether the banks in the US with at least $50 billion in assets each have enough capital, management bandwidth and other safeguards to survive a financial crisis. Ahead of the stress tests results on 29 June, the Fed had said that all big banks would be able to make it through a recession. Since the global financial crisis in the aftermath of the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in September 2008, the banks have been directed to create a cushion of large capital against likely losses from a recession or any other developments that shock the market. The 29 June statement has also outlined areas where the Fed expects further improvement next year.The RBI stress test, on the other hand, indicates that risks to the banking sector increased significantly in the second half of 2015-16, driven by deteriorating asset quality and lower profitability. Indeed, the financial system is resilient but it could become vulnerable if the macroeconomic conditions deteriorate sharply.ALSO READ:
 S4A wont solve the bad loans problem

Saddled with bad assets, the banks are expected to remain risk-averse and not lend money to corporations; besides, in the absence of adequate capital, their ability to lend will also be impacted.Simply put, Indian banks are caught in a vicious cycle: They are not willing to lend for fear of adding to bad assets; this dents their interest income and profitability; and that, in turn, further erodes their ability to lend as they are not able to plough back profits to bolster their capital.The credit growth of Indian banks slowed to 8.8% in March 2016 from 9.4% in September 2015; the growth in deposits too declined from 9.9% to 8.1% during this period.The gross non-performing assets (NPAs) as a percentage of advances rose to 7.6% from 5.1% and, overall, the proportion of stressed advances rose to 11.5% from 11.3%. After setting aside money, the net NPAs of banks rose sharply, from 2.8% to 4.6%, between September and March. On every parameter, the state-owned banks are in a far worse shape than their private peers.In March, the top 100 borrowers accounted for almost 28% of credit to all large borrowers and little over 16% of Rs.75.3 trillion bank credit. They also accounted for more than one-fifth of the gross NPAs of the Indian banking system.The RBI stress test suggests that gross NPAs of the banking system may rise to 9.3% by March 2017 under a severe stress scenario. For the state-owned banks, it could be as high as 11%. Higher bad assets will force banks to set aside more money, dent their profitability, and they would need capital infusion to be able to support the demand of loan from the corporate borrowers.Unlike the US Federal Reserve, which identifies the banks that fail the stress tests, the Indian banking regulator does not expose individual banks and rightly so, as this could lead to a run on a bank with a large number of depositors rushing to withdraw money simultaneously, due to concerns about the particular banks solvency. In such a scenario, the money kept by a bank with RBI in the form of cash reserve ratio as well as the government bond holdingwhich could be liquidated to generate cashmay not be enough to cover the deposit withdrawals. RBI prefers to talk in terms of number of banks at risk and not who they are. For instance, stress tests on banks credit concentration risks, it says, is significant for eight banks, accounting for a little over 12% of advances, and they may end up having capital less than what they require.ALSO READ: 
How many banks are swimming naked?

Since 2010 when the first signs of stress were seen, the government has pumped in Rs.67,734 crore capital to keep the public sector banks running. It has agreed to infuse an additional Rs.70,000 crore even as the state-owned banks will have to raise over Rs.1 trillion from the markets to meet their capital requirements. Media reports suggest that the finance ministry has already finalized the plan for the first round of capital infusion of around Rs.10,000 crore. After pumping in Rs.25,000 crore in 21 state-owned banks last fiscal year, the government has committed to offer Rs.25,000 crore capital to these banks in the current year and another Rs.10,000 crore each in 2018 and 2019.For the big US banks and their investors, the annual stress tests are extremely critical as those who pass the grade are entitled to pay dividends and buy back stocks from their shareholders. In the Indian context, such a test still largely remains an academic exercise as the government seems to believe in a perpetual unconditional bailout theory.In the thick of global financial turmoil, the US Treasury announced a Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, of up to $700 billion to save its privately managed banks from the so-called subprime mortgage crisis. Most of this amount has been invested, loaned or paid out by the Treasury and the banks have returned more in the form of interest, dividend and fees. The band-aid approach that India follows will keep the system alive but one cannot expect a turnaround till such time the government accepts that capital infusion is just one of the tools and it needs to do more to revive the weak banks. Meanwhile, wary of corporate credit, now they are chasing retail loans; the trend will continue till they burn their fingers.ALSO READ:

146,0.2435,"Indias largest mobile services operator, two of the largest pharmaceutical companies, a top-tier IT services firm and the second largest tower infrastructure company have chosen the buyback route to return cash to shareholders this year. This is the first time so many large companies have announced buybacks in quick succession; fiscal year 2016-17 looks set to break all prior records with regards to share repurchases. Along with three large buybacks by government-owned companies, Indian companies have announced buybacks worth over Rs.2,1000 crore so far this year.
				   
				Of course, it will be a while before buybacks topple dividends as the preferred means to return cash. According to data collated by Mint Research, S&P BSE 100 companies alone paid dividends worth Rs.1.51 trillion in FY16. (See bit.ly/29xe7dk). In the same period, the amount spent on buybacks by all listed companies was only Rs.1,800 crore.But this may well be the beginning of a trend where buybacks are used nearly as much, if not more, as dividends to return cash. Research by Credit Suisse shows that in the US, S&P 500 companies spent $572 billion on buybacks in 2015, or 1.5 times of what they spent on dividends. For a number of shareholders, buybacks trump dividends both in terms of tax efficiency and the flexibility they offer. Ironically, in India, the government seems to have overplayed its hand and magnified the relative advantages of buybacks. In the 2016-17 Union budget, finance minister Arun Jaitley introduced an additional tax of 10% on any dividend income of more than Rs.10 lakh. Dividend distribution tax already amounted to 20.4% of payouts.For stocks that have been held for over a year, the buyback route entails a tax outgo of only 0.1%, which is essentially the securities transaction tax (STT) applicable for the transaction. Since 1 July 2015, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has allowed listed companies to make tender buyback offers through stock exchanges. For such transactions, long-term capital gains tax is exempt.Earlier, when companies werent allowed to make tender buyback offers through stock exchanges, investors would end up paying a 10% long-term capital gains tax. To be sure, buybacks through tender offers have picked up since FY16.For high dividend earners, the tax savings through a buyback issue are substantial. Bharti Airtel Ltd holds a 71.7% stake in Bharti Infratel Ltd. The latter has announced a buyback of Rs.2,000 crore. If the promoter tenders shares in proportion to its shareholding, it will take home more than Rs.1,400 crore after accounting for STT and other costs. If Infratel had chosen the dividend route instead, the net take home would be only around Rs.1,000 crore.There is likely to be increasing pressure from shareholders to shift to buybacks, given the tax efficiency. One likely pushback is that Sebi imposes a restriction on companies buying back sharesi.e. that they cant issue fresh equity for a period after the buyback. From a shareholders perspective, buybacks offer the flexibility of foregoing the payout by the company and staying fully invested with the company. They can do this by simply opting to not tender shares in the buyback. With dividends, there is no such option. Of course, one can always use dividend proceeds to buy additional shares, although academic studies show that reinvestment is typically rare and forms a fraction of all dividends received.Another peculiarity about buybacks is that while all shareholders are treated the same with dividends, the pricing of the buyback determines which category of shareholders benefit. Michael J. Mauboussin and Dan Callahan of Credit Suisse point out in a note titled Disbursing Cash to Shareholders, Buybacks benefit ongoing shareholders when management buys stock that is undervalued and benefit outgoing shareholders when the stock is overvalued. Since management should focus on building value per share for continuing shareholders, it should always try to buy back shares that are undervalued.This shouldnt normally matter in a tender offer, where investors can participate in the same proportion as their shareholding. Even so, empirical evidence shows that some shareholders fail to participate, even when they are incentivized by a substantial premium. Needless to say, investors need to keep a close eye on the pricing of the offer; but companies, too, would do well to avoid buybacks by paying a large premium.",2016-07-11,JdsOi2pXYKNjGVP8vvJUFP,"Along with three large share buybacks by government-owned companies, Indian companies have announced buybacks worth over ,2,1000 crore so far this year",01:58,Govts second dividend tax spurs buybacks
105,0.2463,"This month marks the 25th anniversary of Indias big bang economic reforms. This newspaper and many others have recounted the turbulent times preceding July 1991. The backdrop was a succession of unstable governments with a rapidly deteriorating macroeconomy and the commencement of the first Gulf war leading to a spurt in oil prices. There was great drama too, with secret airlifting of Indias sovereign gold to pledge as collateral for an emergency foreign loan.
				   
				Even though 1991 is the marker, it is fair to say that reformist thinking was evident even in the mid-1980s. For instance, there were trade reforms (easing of capital goods imports), financial sector reforms (abolition of control of capital issues) and several other smaller reform measures in the administration and running of the public sector. This prior incremental journey has been forgotten because it was overtaken by the tumultuous events of 1990 and 1991.It is also clear by now that support for the reforms process was sprinkled across different ministries. Some well-known bureaucrats (now acclaimed as the architects of Indias reforms) occupied key positions in the economic ministries and the Prime Ministers Office and saw eye-to-eye on what was needed to be done. Their synergy and collective intellect provided the force for the reforms roll-out. The political cover ultimately came from prime minister Narasimha Rao, whose leadership was crucial for the success of the reforms. Rao managed to obtain key cabinet decisions and consensus without the advantage of a mechanism like the group of ministers, used extensively by his successors.By far the biggest reform of 1991 was industrial delicensing. In one swoop the licence-permit raj was dismantled, eliminating the need for permission to set up a new factory, or indeed even to add capacity to an existing factory. It is true that cement decontrol had commenced earlier in 1989, but an order affecting Indias entire industrial sector was 1991s big move. Interestingly, this particular reform was announced by the then industries minister in the forenoon of 24 July 1991the same day that finance minister Manmohan Singh gave his historic budget speech. The next days jubilant headlines missed out that crucial detail, that the licence raj had been demolished by the industries minister, who was none other than the prime minister himself.The dismantling of the suffocating licensing regime was supposed to unleash the industrial sector in a big way. Just like our East Asian peers, we should have seen a jump in the share of manufacturing in national gross domestic product (GDP). Unfortunately this promise was never fulfilled. The share of manufacturing was 16.41% in 1989-90 and is 16.2% in 2015-16 (new GDP series). If anything, it has fallen just a bit. This is a big puzzle. Additionally, even employment in the organized manufacturing sector, especially the public sector, has remained stagnant. It is true that in real terms GDP has quadrupled, which means industrial production too is four times bigger (since its share has remained constant). But it should have galloped and increased its share. The National Manufacturing Policy (NMP) aims to increase the share from the current level to 25% in the next seven years. This seems almost impossible in light of the experience of the past 25 years. The reasons for the stagnation could be many: excessive tax burden, inadequate infrastructure and connectivity, unreliable electricity, non-availability of credit or appropriately skilled labour, lack of research, development or technology adoption and so on.One of the members of the 1991 reforms team and former Reserve Bank of India deputy governor Rakesh Mohan also pointed out another troubling feature. This is manifest in Indias trade balance. If you take out the 6-7% earnings from remittances and software exports, and add 1-2% as healthy current account deficit for a growing economy like India, then our merchandise trade balance is a negative 8-9% of GDP. This is largely the shortage of industrial goods in the country. This gap reflects our inability to service our domestic market in a variety of industrial sectors, from electronics and cellphones to capital goods and machinery. Foreign imports, superior in quality and cheaper (thanks to an overvalued exchange rate), manage to swamp our markets and harness our purchasing power. E-commerce companies are probably sourcing the bulk of their merchandise through imports anyway. According to a Ficci study, the logistics cost component can be as high as 17% of the domestic cost of industrial production. (This includes the ad hoc entry taxes arbitrarily slapped on interstate movement of goods).The NMP document of 2013 already has the blueprint of what needs to be done. Initiatives like Make in India and Mudra Bank loans to small and medium entrepreneurs, the nationwide roll-out of the goods and services tax, easing of power shortagesall will cumulatively give a fillip to industrial production. But as we deal with and solve the problems of yesterday, the challenges of tomorrow are already at our doorstep. This means dealing with the rise of robotics, 3-D printing, vastly diffused and distributed value chains across countries and falling trade barriers thanks to free trade agreements. Raising the share of manufacturing in GDP: this is a hard nut to crack, but crack it we must.Ajit Ranade is chief economist at Aditya Birla Group.

				But while Infosys Ltd and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) have presented contrasting images of each other at times, together the two big Indian software exporters have held a mirror. Analysts have used them to view global spending on those invisible lines of computer code that enable large corporations to run themselves. No longer. The picture the duo are displaying now is more about how their own industry is at risk of being overrun by robots.Infosys operating margin 
Before last quarters results, Infosys was doing a relatively better job of gaining investor approval. This time last year, TCS shares enjoyed a 15% higher valuation than Infosys, based on analysts expectations of future earnings. By this week, that had turned into a small discount.Then on Thursday, TCS beat revenue and profit estimates for the June quarter, but operating margins shrank to 25%. Thats below the managements targeted range of 26% to 28%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Infosys, which reported on Friday, cut its sales forecast for the year. Worse still, its operating margin came in at just 24.1%, extending a nearly four-year decline in relative profitability for the Bangalore-based group.Two years ago, Infosys tapped SAP executive Vishal Sikka to take over from the founders, who all seemed bent on having a go at running the company before retirement. For a while, it looked like they might run it aground. But while Infosys has steadied under Sikka, its increasingly clear that the new normal for operating margins for both Infosys and TCS may be around 25%, and not the 29% to 31% that at least Infosys used to hit fairly regularly before its management merry-go-around left it dizzy.Profitability is now capped by robots, or, to be more specific, a combination of artificial intelligence, digital technologies, blockchain and other innovations that are challenging the traditional strategy of throwing people at complex software problems and charging clients for their time. But while the large Indian vendors are themselves investing in these new areas, so much of their legacy business depends on exploiting the price difference between techies in the West and in developing countries, its not clear if theyll be able to switch to a people-lite business model in time.For the top four Indian vendors, growth in total employment has slowed to 8% levels, from 106% in the year ended in March 2012. But nimbler challengers are threatening to nibble at juicy businesses faster than the Indian companies can slim down. For instance, UK-based start-up Thought Machine has created a new, blockchain-based core banking package that resides in the cloud and wont require expensive in-house data centers, according to a report this week in Artificial Intelligence Online. TCS has made two acquisitions of more than $500 million in value, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. The last was in 2014. Infosys hasnt done any of that size with its $5 billion in cash. TCS fell as much as 3.8% in Mumbai on Friday, while Infosys slumped almost 11%. The relative performance of the two is no longer much of an investment theme. Of far greater importance is how they take on those robots. Bloomberg

87,0.24595,"Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) had reported a premium of $3.1 per barrel over the Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) for the March quarter. For the June quarter, that premium was expected to expand further. However, the reported premium of $6.5 per barrel, the highest in the last eight years according to RIL, far exceeded Street estimates. Most analysts had estimated the companys GRM to be in the range of $9.5-10 per barrel. On the contrary, RILs GRM in the June quarter came in at $11.5 per barrel.
				   
				There are a couple of reasons for this outperformance. One, as Alok Agarwal, chief financial officer at RIL, said, We did have a build-up in inventory towards the end of last quarter and we were able to liquidate that inventory at better prices than at the end of the last quarter. Secondly, middle distillates, which include gas oil (diesel) and aviation fuel and account for nearly 45% of the companys product slate, performed better. Our crude sourcing was competitive too, pointed out Agarwal.Even as the GRM beat is strong, not everybody is impressed. Theres no point in taking a call on GRM alone, said independent analyst S.P. Tulsian. He added that looking at inventory at the end of the last fiscal year, it is likely that inventory gains, perhaps to the extent of approximately $2.5 per barrel, are included in the reported GRM.Nonetheless, the fact remains that a strong performance by the refining segment did help the company beat analysts estimates by a good margin. But its worth remembering that the RIL stock has already gone up in the past five trading sessions.Moreover, the performance of other business segments is not very encouraging. Sure, petrochemicals business Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin improved to 14.9% from 14% in the March quarter. But that was largely in line with Street estimates. While the oil and gas business reported an Ebit of Rs.48 crore compared with a loss in the March quarter, it hardly moves the needle for RIL. Losses of US shale operations increased.Stand-alone revenue declined about 19%, reflecting the decline in broader crude oil prices, while net profit increased about 19% to Rs.7,548 crore. That was because of a 628 basis point jump in operating profit margin to 20%, while depreciation cost declined 3% and other income increased 18.5%, helping net profit growth. A basis point is 0.01%.What of the stock? RIL shares have underperformed the benchmark Sensex since it announced its March quarter numbers. Some reasons for the underperformance can be attributed to the fact that the company had guided analysts about delays in commissioning of its downstream projects, lower refining margin environment and lack of clarity on the timelines of its telecom launch.Currently, one RIL share trades at about 11 times its estimated earnings per share for this fiscal year. Of course, news flow on the telecom launch will be an important measure to track and so will developments on commissioning of downstream expansion projects. In the near term, what is worrisome is that Singapore refining margins have hardly improved. Even as RIL delivered a great beat in the June quarter, the pertinent questions are whether that will sustain. As of now, analysts dont see inventory gains recurring for the current quarter.The crude spreads that are relevant to RILs refineries have contracted in June and July 2016 from levels in April and May 2016, according to ICICI Securities Ltd. This contraction of light-heavy crude spread would hit RILs GRM if it sustains, wrote analysts from ICICI Securities in a note on 7 July. Unfortunately for investors, it could well mean that the robust GRM performance seen last quarter may not be repeated in the current one.The writer does not have positions in the companies discussed here.",2016-07-16,BYyVceR6MiTJTGQ0FWjPEK,"Most analysts had estimated its gross refining margins to be $9.5-10 per barrel; on the contrary, RILs margins in the June quarter came in at $11.5 per barrel

183,0.24255,"Hong Kong: SoftBank is set to fork out $32 billion for the British chip designer ARM Holdings, just one week after Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlins Dalian Wanda Group sealed a $1.2 billion deal to buy the UKs Odeon & UCI Cinemas Group, citing the cheaper pound.
				   
				Sterling is now down 7.4% against the yuan this year, chiefly because of the 23 June vote to leave the European Union, and has fallen 10.3% against the dollar  and a massive 21% against the yen. That left Cambridge-based ARM, whose stock has risen 17% in pound terms since the referendum, still looking like a good bet.Thats because its a bet on the future, in particular the so-called internet of things. ARM isnt the worlds biggest chip designer, but it has been among the nimblest, shifting into smartphones while the likes of Intel remained more dependent on computers. As smartphone sales slow, ARM is selling licenses for chip designs that can boost computing power in everyday devices ranging from connected beds to farm sensors. ARM also has a tiny debt load of 9.5 million pounds ($12.6 million) at the end of last year.This is SoftBanks biggest deal since the Sprint purchase was announced in 2012, and its being done at a premium of 43%  on the face of it, a massive strain on the Japanese companys total debt of about ¥11.9 trillion ($112.8 billion) at 31 March.SoftBank shares have fallen in the past year as the company reeled from losses at Sprint, and efforts to turn around the US wireless carrier forced the company to sell almost $10 billion of its stake in a much more successful asset, the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, last month.Affordability isnt necessarily a problem for SoftBank. The stock dipped after founder Masayoshi Sons heir apparent Nikesh Arora abruptly stepped down the day before the UK referendum. But last month, the company sold its majority stake in Supercell, the Finnish maker of the popular Clash of Clans game, for $8.6 billion. Proceeds from that deal, and from the Alibaba disposal, should be booked this year.And SoftBank still has almost $60 billion in Alibaba stock, Japanese mobile operations that make money, and 43% of the countrys biggest and most profitable search engine, Yahoo Japan, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Michelle Ma.Crucially, SoftBank also has ¥2.6 trillion in cash, and operates in a country with negative interest rates.ARM isnt cheap: Its trading at 49 times current earnings, compared with Intels 14.4 times. Only much smaller Chinese peers like Zhuhai Orbita Control Engineering, at 145 times earnings, are more expensive.Unlike Sprint, however, which was struggling before SoftBank bought it, ARM looks like a smart investment that the pounds decline made smarter.

				Bloombergs consensus on the price-to-earnings multiple forecast for FY17 has risen several notches since April on the back of rising earnings estimates. But this is not alarming, given the host of positive developments in the company over the last few months.The management decision pencilled several quarters ago to gradually exit non-core businesses has started unfolding. Last week, it said that it plans to sell about 15% in its subsidiary, L&T Technology Services Ltd. This comes close on the heels of the success of L&T Infotech Ltds initial public offering, another unit where the parent sold about 10%.Indeed, these may be a drop in the ocean; considering the huge cash-flow requirement for its engineering and construction business, it has set the wheel of value-unlocking rolling.That is not all. The company intends to sell some operational road assets, power and ports, which are losing money.A Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd report dated 14th July, echoes the same sentiment, saying, these businesses together total losses of about Rs.1,000 crore, which, once sold, will add at least 2% to its return on equity.But then, selling loss-making businesses is not a cakewalk and could take time.There is a leap of faith on the Street. Investors seem to be buying into the management vision that cash flows from better operations and exit from non-core businesses should significantly reduce working capital from current levels. Note that net working capital had shot up from about 17% of sales to 24% in just three years, due to delays in project execution, customer payments, vendor support and so on. The economic revival should also alleviate these problems over the next 12-24 months.That said, there are concerns still on order inflows and margin trajectory. Order inflows for FY16 shocked the Street, declining 12% from a year ago, unable to meet the managements watered down forecast of flat order inflows. This fiscal, they are likely to grow by 15%. However, a report by Religare Capital Markets Ltd points out that order inflows are likely to be flat over FY15 levels, highlighting the plateauing of order inflows, given the high base and a weak investment cycle. Analysts are also apprehensive that a shift to Indian Accounting Standards norms can hurt margins.The macroeconomic clouds are clearing up, what with rising oil prices, a normal monsoon, along with the governments push on infrastructure. This should accelerate order inflows from the Middle East region, where L&T has a presence, and on home ground, albeit a few quarters later.Until then, a firm focus on executing its existing order book, which is about thrice the current revenue, will hold it in good stead. This is one reason why investors may choose to ignore near-term challenges on project execution and margin weakness. After all, it still remains the best equity play on infrastructure.",2016-07-18,NnFWaoNCbXOhaAqhxArq4I,"Investors seem to be buying into L&T management vision that cash flows from better operations and exit from non-core businesses should reduce working capital

289,0.248725,"The inordinate delay in Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds commercial launch is giving incumbents time in preparing for the coming onslaught. They first incentivized data consumption by cutting rates only for non-peak hours with so-called night plans. This week, Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd increased data benefits on some of their pre-paid data recharge packs. Vodafone India Ltd hasnt bothered to respond yet. 
				   
				These arent signs of an industry desperately adjusting to the reality of a new large entrant; instead, the moves by incumbents suggest a carefully calibrated strategy that is aimed at ultimately blunting the price advantage of Reliance Jio. Consider the latest changes in pricing. Most headlines screamed Bharti, Idea cut data tariffs by 67%; but this is far from the truth. To start with, these companies havent cut tariffs by 67%; they have increased data benefits by 67%. And that too, only in some packs. Its important to note that the majority of data subscribers use plans ranging from 500MB to 1.5GB, with the flagship plan being the 1GB plan. The latest changes in tariffs havent touched this plan at all. In other words, incumbents arent yet ready to sacrifice revenues and margins with their flagship plans. Idea Cellular has inched towards making its data services more affordable in this segmentits 2GB plan now comes at the cost of the earlier 1.5GB plan. But clearly, theres no hurry to cut prices meaningfully in the most popular plans and drive volume growth. Also Read: Reliance Jio to go for Rs15,000 crore rights issue

This column has pointed out earlier that growth in data volumes has dropped sharply in recent quarters. For the top three telcos, incremental data volumes fell to 14,680 terabytes in the March quarter, compared with an average of 31,230 terabytes in the preceding four quarters. In this backdrop, its imperative that incumbents cut tariffs meaningfully to attract new customers and drive consumption. But it now looks like these significant changes in pricing will happen only after Reliance Jio launches. Evidently, incumbents dont want to play all their cards upfront.For now, they are teasing subscribers to increase data consumption by reducing the price of larger packs (exceeding 2GB). Considering that these companies are running under-utilised networks, these incentives dont entail additional costs. As such, revenues and margins are pretty much protected.But what this effective reduction in prices for larger packs does is that it further blunts the price advantage that Reliance Jio can offer when it eventually launches operations. Of course, theres no limit to how low Reliance Jio can go with prices to win market share. Even so, with the every successive calibration in data tariffs, incumbents have managed to reduce the extent to which Reliance Jio can disrupt the market.",2016-07-21,beknhdWUSzBNA8rY1yyXGJ,"Moves of Incumbents suggest a carefully calibrated strategy that is aimed at ultimately blunting the price advantage of Reliance Jio

38,0.2495,"There is something about magical realism that appeals to our innermost human emotions. Literature has many examples where magical elements exist as part of the real world. Consider the ordinary wooden cupboard which opens up to Narnia in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; or platform 9¾ of Londons Kings Cross station, the secret entrance to board a train to Hogwarts in the Harry Potter series; or the town of Macondo in One Hundred Years of Solitude, where the surreal is the normal.
				   
				The success of Pokémon Go is also in the realm of magical realismas augmented reality brings magical pocket monsters to our real world.It is no secret that the Pokémon Go craze has swept across the world. It has players in the US, Australia, New Zealand and major parts of Europe hooked. Terms such as PokéStops, Pokémon gyms and Pokéballs have already become common parlance.The first home video game consolea device that outputs a video signal or visual image to display a video gamewas manufactured as early as 1972, much before the days of Nintendos Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda. This bulky ensemble of a black, white and brown box called the Odyssey, manufactured by Magnavox, pales in comparison to the sophisticated modern-day versions of Sonys PlayStation and Microsofts Xbox. Nevertheless, it marked the beginning of a new mode of entertainment.Today, according to statistics published by the Entertainment Software Association, a majority of frequent gamers find that consoles hold more value for money than DVDs, movies and music. Four out of five US households own a device used to play video games with the average age of a player being 35 years.Thus, it is not surprising that Pokémon Go did well in a region which has been addicted to gaming for decades. Augmented reality via a smartphone as opposed to the virtual world created within the confines of homes by consoles offers something of a fresh perspective to the ordinarily sedentary gamer. It lets an individual walk about his locality, represented by an avatar guided by his phones GPS, and catch, train and battle with virtual creatures superimposed on the real world. Even if one accounts for the incidents of falling off cliffs and mugging, or the claims that video games decrease the grey area of the brain, the game has a charm to it and an unreal one at that.The video game mania of the modern-day world is not however, restricted to its fetish for the unreal. It is also the huge level of self-actualization and gratification that a gamer feels when he catches them all as the catch phrase for any Pokémon game reminds us. Within the human brain is the reward system which is responsible for desire, pleasure and positive reinforcement. When rewardedsay with virtual monsters or other awardsthe brain releases a compound called dopamine which encodes information about the salience, value, and context of a reward. This reward system is the one which induces appetitive or consummatory behaviour. Psychological theories like operant conditioning say that the frequency of a behaviour will increase if rewarded and decrease if penalized. Other theories such as the one given by Wolfram Schultz propounds that unexpected rewards or rewards greater than expected can also increase dopamine levels.The most popular video games of the past few years such as Diablo and World of Warcraft have been known to capitalize on this reward-seeking mentality of the human brain. Pokémon Go provides all the key ingredients responsible for activating the reward systemgratification, fast pace and unpredictability. The key towards maintaining the public interest in the game in future will also lie in these very ingredients.Meanwhile, another gameto monetize Pokémon Gois already emerging in the backdrop. Ad agencies are already neck-deep in research to find out ways to lure customers to nearby shops and restaurants from PokéStops. According to an article in the Financial Times, Niantics previous release Ingress which also involved virtual portals mapped on streets had found good commercial footing owing to the willingness of retailers and service providers to pay for promotions in the game. Pokémon Go too shows similar, if not higher potential. The trick is to reap the benefits before the crescendo dies. Theythe programmers, the advertisers and entrepreneurshave just one motto too: Gotta Catch Em All.Will Pokémon Go find similar success rates in India?

130,0.241775,"The Ashok Leyland Ltd stock gained 3.64% on BSE on Thursday, after the company surprised the Street by reporting a strong performance for the June quarter (Q1). A slowdown in sales of the better-priced medium and heavy commercial vehicles (M&HCV), which grew 12% in Q1 compared with 44% growth a year ago, together with a rise in input costs had been expected to dent profitability.Contrarily, Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margins expanded 1.1 percentage points to 11.2%. Operating profit jumped 21% as raw material costs remained under control and pricing did not deteriorate much. According to Religare Capital Markets Ltd, net realization per vehicle fell by less than 1% compared with estimates of a 2-3% drop.The better-than-expected realizations helped Ashok Leyland comfortably beat revenue and profit estimates. Revenue grew 10% and profit doubled. Further, the company sounded optimistic on exports. Key export markets were down in Q1 but are expected to bounce back in Q2 and beyond, Vinod K. Dasari, managing director, Ashok Leyland, said in a statement. Tepid exports were part of the reason for the slowdown in sales.The strong show fuelled gains in the stock whose valuation, at 19 times earnings estimates for the current fiscal year, is not cheap. For it to continue its upward journey, the company needs to maintain sales momentum. It is here that there is a bit of concern. Sales in the last two months grew at an unexciting pace of 6-7%. Channel checks by Nitesh Sharma, auto analyst at PhillipCapital (India) Pvt. Ltd, indicate subdued volume growth in the near term. Another analyst, who does not want to be named, says he wants to see the demand and pricing environment for another quarter before deciding on earnings upgrades.Of course, purchases ahead of changes in pollution norms can aid sales in the later part of the current fiscal year. But that is more of a long-term view. In the near term, much depends on the demand environment and the kind of monthly sales numbers the company will clock.",2016-07-22,HGLq7XM95ICJudxAyJuj5J,"Better-than-expected realizations helped Ashok Leyland comfortably beat revenue and profit estimates

24,0.2478,"Vodafone India Ltds June quarter results suggest competitive pressures eased in the voice segment for the mobile services industry; although the data segment continues to struggle for growth.The company said last week, Voice revenues returned to growth as competition eased, although the 2.2% year-on-year growth in June is nothing to get too excited about. Revenues were flat in the March quarter.Data revenue grew by 22%, year-on-year (y-o-y), down from 35% in the March quarter and as high as 65% just a year ago. Nevertheless, its heartening to note that the company has taken some steps to spur growth. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, data volume grew by 6.5%, up from a mere 0.7% growth in the March quarter.In the fourth quarter of the last fiscal, some companies such as Idea Cellular Ltd and Vodafone had reduced promotions in the market, which had resulted in slightly better price realizations, but had hit growth. There seems to have been a reversal in strategy in the June quarter. Its likely ldea, too, may report a bounceback in data growth sequentially.Of course, the key is for this growth to sustain. As things stand, the incumbents in the sector seem to be content upgrading existing users to 3G and 4G services. The total number of data users has more or less stagnated at Vodafone India. They have grown by only 4% in the past one year. The only reason data volume is growing at a faster pace is that a much larger proportion of users have shifted to 3G/4G services, where consumption is about three-to-four times higher, compared with 2G data services (see chart). Of course, theres a limit to how much the data segment can grow with this strategy.This month, Bharti Airtel Ltd, Idea and Vodafone increased data benefits in an attempt to get subscribers to increase usage. But such a strategy is unlikely to provide a breakthrough in attracting new data customers.As such, it seems like it will only be after Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds launch that data prices will crash meaningfully enough to attract new users. Until then, the incumbents seem content to coast along as far as volumes and revenues go. Its important to note that despite sluggish volumes and a drop in price realizations, they have managed to maintain (in some cases, even improve) profit margins and generate large amounts of cash. Vodafone Indias profit margins stood at 28% two years ago, and are at over 29% now. Avoiding a mad rush for volume growth looks like a sane choice after all.",2016-07-25,3yLNXVt9kLeUIx2XURqvJJ,"It seems like it will only be after Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds launch that data prices will crash meaningfully enough to attract new users

321,0.245025,"Nintendos Pokemon Go profits are about as real as Pikachu.
				   
				The companys late Friday revelation that the global craze for chasing imaginary creatures with a smartphone wont be a huge earnings driver confirms what many had suspected, but which the stock had not yet reflected. That changed Monday with Nintendo falling by its 18% limit in early Tokyo trading. The plunge left the shares 73% higher than a month ago, before Pokemon Go was unleashed.Also read: Behavioural science and Pokémon GoTo put that move in context, the massive run-up leaves Nintendo only 42% higher for the year to date and just 15% up on 12 months ago. In other words, Pokemon Go may have driven the stock, but a lot of that gain has been recovering lost ground over the past year.But theres an even more important issue to consider here. Why isnt a top app-store ranking, incessant media coverage and sponsorship deals with fast-food restaurants turning into a windfall for Nintendo?The company itself outlined one of the reasons in its statement last week. Pokemon Go isnt developed or distributed by Nintendo, but by Niantic, a spinoff from AlphabetGoogles parent company. Pokemon itself is owned by The Pokemon Co., of which Nintendo only owns 32%, and The Pokemon Co. gets a licensing fee and compensation for collaboration in developing Pokemon Go. So any earnings from Pokemon Go make their way to The Pokemon Co. through a filtered process, details of which arent public. Nintendo only gets to recognize its portion of those profits through the equity method of accounting.Hence Nintendos headline statement: Because of this accounting scheme, the income reflected on the companys consolidated business results is limited. It also means that movie rights, fast-food deals and any other spinoffs Pokemon Go inspires only get to Nintendo through The Pokemon Co.All of this would have been taken into account when Nintendo laid out on 27 April its forecast for the 12 months to 31 March 2017 . The fact that it said on Friday that its not modifying the consolidated financial forecast for now indicates how underwhelming the upside is from the Pokemeon Go craze and why investors are right to finally start questioning it.If The Pokemon Co. has done a poor job of extracting more from the likes of McDonalds amid the Go craze, then theres not a lot Nintendo can do about it.To further rain on Pokemon Gos parade, investors need also to understand that a hit game does not a windfall profit make. The app, and thus the game, are free and free is a very low barrier to getting users to download it to their smartphonesespecially when every media outlet in the world is hyping it as a phenomenon.Also read: How Pokemon Go went from Google prank to Nintendo phenomenonThe revenue model is in-app purchases of items that could help players improve their scores. Pokemon Gos conversion rates, which track dollars per user or how many users buy items, arent yet publicly available, and may never be made so. One estimate puts the conversion at about $1 per download so far, which is actually quite good but falls far short of justifying Nintendos share-price runup.What Nintendo really needs is for Niantic to find a way to extract even more money per user, and for The Pokemon Co. to get more cash out of the characters before the phenomenon dies down.Choosing not to raise its outlook amid the craze indicates that Nintendo may have trouble doing either, and thats a bad omen for its hopes of repeating this hit.We already know Pokemon Gos success is about as big as any augmented-reality and mobile-app spinoff is ever likely to get. In that light, dont bet on Mario, Luigi or Donkey Kong beating Pikachu to the profits.

241,-0.21705,"What started as the government poking its nose into a straightforward commercial arrangement is threatening to become another blot on Indias record of dealing with foreign investors  and New Delhi has only itself to blame.
				   
				In early 2009, NTT Docomo invested Rs14,500 crore ($2.2 billion) in an Indian wireless business on the understanding that if certain targets werent met in five years, its partner, Mumbai-based Tata Group, would either find a buyer for the Japanese companys 26.5% stake at fair market value, or would take over those shares at half the original value of the investment, whichever was higher. When Docomo decided to exercise the option in April 2014, there was no taker for the unprofitable operations, so the Tatas sought central bank permission to pay out the equivalent of Rs7,250 crore.By then, however, the Reserve Bank of India had a new set of rules that banned any exit by a foreign equity investor at an assured price. Still, the central bank, under Governor Raghuram Rajan, wanted to allow the payment because it was a question of an Indian company honouring an agreement, struck at a time when there was no clear law against options embedded in such an investment. Also, this clearly wasnt a case of foreign-currency debt masquerading as equity. How many creditors agree in advance to a 50% haircut after five years? Yet the Indian government, which had the final say, decided the Tatas shouldnt be allowed to pay Docomo.In January 2015, Docomo took the dispute to the London Court for International Arbitration. Last month, the court awarded the Japanese firm $1.17 billion (Rs7,840 crore at the current rate) in compensation from Tata Sons, the Indian conglomerates holding company.The saga should have ended there, except that:Bloomberg News reports that New Delhi intends to block the arbitration payment, too; Japans Nikkei says Docomo might ask a US court to seize Tata assets; The Financial Times has learned from a person close to Docomo that the Japanese company might seek enforcement action on Tata Groups British businesses; and The Tata Group is countering that the struggling Port Talbot steel plant in south Wales, as well as UK-based Jaguar Land Rover, are owned by Tata Steel and Tata Motors  theyre not Tata Sons properties. So the whole thing has become a spectacle. The Indian governments refusal to take a commonsense view of Docomos claim was a poor decision. New Delhi is now making bad judgment worse by threatening to block the arbitration award.Such actions have consequences. Not only has the governments pigheadedness created unnecessary risks for minority shareholders of publicly traded Tata Steel and Tata Motors, it has also cast doubts on Prime Minister Narendra Modis resolve to change investors experience of doing business in India. The Docomo debacle is the depth of dumb.

				The average revenue per user (Arpu) at Rs.174 for the June quarter remained unchanged, compared with the March quarter, despite a price increase. Arun Kapoor, chief executive officer, Dish TV, says the company effected an average 4-5% price hike in packs in March, but that did not translate into better Arpus for the June quarter as it takes time for people to get used to it. Also, there was some downgrading that happened. Still, for the year as a whole, Arpu is expected to grow 3-4%, adds Kapoor. Even though the company intends to effect another round of price hike during Diwali, meeting the Arpu growth guidance could be challenging.Dish  TVs consolidated revenue increased 5.7% over the same period last year to Rs.779 crore. However, starting 1 April, the company changed its accounting of entertainment tax in keeping with industry practice. Earlier, entertainment tax was a part of operating expenditure; it is now netted off against subscription revenues. According to the company, on a like-to-like basis, revenue growth is 10.9%, compared with last year.To that extent, netting off entertainment tax from revenues did boost reported earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) margin. The measure showed a 200 basis points expansion to 34%. But, on a like-to-like basis, Ebitda margin has improved only slightly. Further, a free cash flow of Rs.62.7 crore in the June quarter is lower than the Rs.104.7 crore notched up in the March quarter. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Dish TV did well on the subscriber additions front, adding 402,000 subscribers. The company met its guidance of 1.5 million net subscriber additions in fiscal 2016. For the current fiscal year, Dish TV has a target of 1.5-1.9 million net subscriber additions. That shouldnt be an issue. If one assumes the June quarter subscriber addition run rate for the rest of FY17, then it would comfortably surpass the lower end of the guidance.Overall revenue growth guidance is 12-15%. Dish TV shares have underperformed the BSE-200 index since the beginning of the calendar year. One factor that could change the trend is better Arpus and a better Ebitda margin, considering the company has provided a guidance for 35% Ebitda margin for FY17. Investors would do well to watch those parameters in the coming quarters.",2016-07-29,uXM735InTSCNOoQECcHbIL,"Even though the company intends to effect another round of price hike during Diwali, meeting the Arpu growth guidance could be challenging

114,0.1985,"Paris: Facebook and Google are the 800-pound gorillas in online advertising because of audience reach and superior targeting. They enjoy another lesser-known advantage: theyre largely immune to ad blocking.
				   
				People install ad blockers to strip out marketing messages and the trackers used to target ads. Theyre more widespread on computers but theyre migrating slowly to mobile too. Analysts estimate that ad blocking cost web publishers nearly $22 billion in lost ad sales last year, compared with total internet ad sales of $160 billion.Yet its becoming clear that the pain isnt being shared equally, and this is more bad news for newspaper, magazine, and television companies. What started as a consumer movement sparked by rage about intrusive ads, security and privacy seems to be strengthening the internets big beasts.Not only does old world media lack the tech chops to beat the blockers, their fragile finances make it hard to turn away ad dollars in the name of user experience. Google and Facebooks resources dwarf the legacy publishers. But even when looked at on a proportional basis, old medias investment in its own future is anemic. Last year, Google spent 16.4% of revenue on R&D, according to Bloomberg data, and Facebook almost a quarter. At Daily Mail & General Trust, owner of one of the most popular news sites, it was 3.6%.Facebook is a textbook example of how technology enshrines advantage. While it was prey to ad blockers when most users preferred computers, its played a blinder in the shift to mobile. The ads within the mobile Facebook app (and its photo-sharing app Instagram) cant be stripped out by blockers. Theyre delivered by Facebook servers with none of the usual identifiers.Googles main defence is its iron grip on search ads. These paid-for links, which appear by results when users look for information on plane fares or movie tickets, arent as annoying as pop-up ads or videos. One caveat: Googles display advertising, such as banner ads or videos on YouTube, is more threatened by ad blockers than Facebooks. Unlike the social media giant, Google ads arent sheltered within an app.Yet this is small comfort for traditional media. Once ad blocking usage hits about 20% of the population, it really starts to hurt publishers, according to John Montgomery of WPPs GroupM. The New York Times and others are desperate for online ads to make up the shortfall from print, but its hard going as the chart below shows. Falling prices for their online ads, which cannot match the targeting precision of Facebook or Google, are the main culprit, but ad blockers arent helping.Since most publishers rely on external networks to sell their online ad space, the ads are easily identified and cut out by blockers. Efforts to coax people to turn off the blockers are becoming common, but have yet to prove effective. Blocking increases pressure on free sites such as the Daily Mail and Guardian to impose paywalls. But its tough to sell general news, which is freely available elsewhere.One answer could be to turn to the web giants for help. A year ago, Facebook created a tool that hosts publishers content within the social network, theoretically taking them off the ad blockers radars too. Google has a similar initiative.Yet such assistance isnt free and makes old media ever more dependent on Silicon Valley for its future. Hardly a secure prospect for a beleaguered industry.

112,0.2476,"The goods and services tax (GST) will undoubtedly give India a facelift on the taxation front. Of course, the suspense over the rate at which GST will be levied remains.
				   
				While it is difficult to quantify the impact on various sectors until the government announces the final GST rate, analysts and economists are assuming a standard rate of 17-18%.If that happens, then companies in the manufacturing sector are expected to benefit, while those in the services sector stand to lose.Also read: GST: The road ahead for industry

Of course, even though the bill has been passed in the current session, it will be another couple of years until GST is fully rolled out. As such, its premature to conclude how this reform will impact stock prices in the near term. In any case, there are various other factors that impact stock prices, and while GST is an important reform, analysts are more keen about indicators of the economic recovery.The winners 
1) Automobiles: The auto sector is likely to emerge as a winner from GST implementation, provided the rate is below the total tax incidence for the sector (>27%). GST is expected to lead to lower prices for the end user and thus boost demand. Companies to benefit include Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. Both stocks have outperformed the market so far this fiscal year. Analysts believe some impact of GST could well be priced in at current levels.2) Multiplexes: Multiplex companies pay around 25% of the average revenue per user (average ticket price + food and beverage spends, or F&B per head) as taxes, according to Kotak Institutional Equities. This is in three broad areas(a) entertainment tax on net ticket sales, (b) Value-added tax (VAT) on F&B, and (c) service tax on input costs for which there is no set-off available. No wonder, GST is expected to reduce the tax burden and improve the Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin. Stocks of PVR Ltd and Inox Leisure Ltd have increased 50% and 30%, respectively, so far in FY17, suggesting the shares are factoring in most of the positives. Of course, there are other factors that are driving these shares.3) FMCG: If the GST rate is less than or equal to 18%, then it should be positive for most consumer goods companies, point out analysts at Citigroup. Of course, much depends on which exemptions are retained and which of the current excise benefits are grandfathered. In addition, there will be gains from warehouse rationalization and a better competitive position vis-à-vis unorganized firms. But gains arent expected to be massive and will occur gradually; as such, stocks may not react dramatically just because the GST bill is passed.If cigarettes attract a higher tax incidence under the GST regime, then it will have an adverse impact on companies such as ITC Ltd.4) Logistics: Supply chain management is expected to get a boost and transit time will reduce. Further, interstate trade barriers would reduce and eventually result in better interstate commerce. Consolidation of warehousing facilities is expected. Stocks that may benefit include Container Corp. of India Ltd and Transport Corp. of India Ltd. Citis analysts point out that the better operating environment could lead Gateway Distriparks Ltd to enter the domestic business.5) Cement: The anticipated 18% GST rate is far lower than what cement companies are paying currently, and analysts expect cement makers to pass on the benefits to consumers as demand continues to remain weak. Whether this alone will help revive demand is another matter altogether.6) Retail: The opportunity to set off input tax credit on rent is expected to aid margin expansion. But retail companies are facing other problems. Shoppers Stop Ltds stock has underperformed the benchmark Sensex this year, as underlying demand remains weak and like-to-like sales growth has been lacklustre.Also read: GST reforms: Are companies prepared?

The losers
As mentioned earlier, services-related sectors are expected to be negatively impacted, as they may have to shell out higher taxes than what they are currently paying. Service tax rate is currently at about 15%.1) Telecom: The moderate rise in tax outgo could hit demand and revenues. But there would be a simultaneous set-off of taxes (Cenvat, or central VAT) paid on certain capex inputs. So, the impact would be marginal. But telcos have bigger problems. Data volumes are slowing and the Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd launch can worsen matters.2) Consumer staples and discretionary: Many consumer staples currently have low indirect tax. Hence, GST will be negative for companies in food processing, bakery, edible oil, dairy segments and personal care items. Quick service restaurants too will be adversely impacted. Kotak Institutional Equities sees some impact on Britannia Industries Ltd and ITC.

In the mainstay voice business, average realization per minute improved for the second consecutive quarter, due to a reduction in promotional offers. But this strategy backfired as far as volume growth was concernedvoice volumes fell by 1% sequentially.

In all, revenue grew by 8% y-o-y. At the same time, thanks to a vigorous expansion in its data network coverage, network operating costs rose by 16% y-o-y. Profit margins naturally fell. Adjusted for one-offs, Kotaks analysts estimate Ebitda margins fell 90 basis points y-o-y. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. A basis point is 0.01%.Profit after tax slumped 65%, which was more or less on expected lines, as interest costs almost tripled on network expansion, spectrum renewal and acquisition costs.

				Five out of the seven public sector banks that reported quarterly results on Friday made a loss and the profit-makers, State Bank of India (SBI) and Oriental Bank of Commerce, showed a worse bad loan ratio. But their shares surged, with SBI rising more than 7%, and Bank of India gaining over 10%. Here are a few reasons why investors believe theres value in bank stocks, despite the rash of bad loans.Falling rate of slippages: This is one of the clearest signs that public sector banks are getting a grip on the bad loan problem. Lenders labelled a massive Rs.1.5 trillion worth of loans as non-performing in the March quarter. In the June quarter, the addition has come down to Rs.50,000 crore. This is something investors are cheering.Provisions: Banks have provided for most of the big troubled accounts in the March quarter, courtesy the Reserve Bank of Indias asset quality review. Provisions have halved for the 25 public sector lenders in the June quarter. Sure, some more skeletons may tumble out of the cupboard. But these are unlikely to be of the magnitude of provisions made in the March quarter. What do lower provisions mean? Higher profits, of course.Retail loan growth: Barring big banks such as SBI and Bank of Baroda, public sector lenders were slow to wake up to Indias consumption story. But now, every public sector bank has announced its plan to focus on retail lending. Rising retail consumption, which is fuelled by personal loans, could well pull them out of their credit abyss. Retail loan growth at Bank of India was 13%, at Union Bank of India 14% and that at SBI 20% in the June quarter.Merge or perish: For the public sector lenders to survive, some will have to die. The government is more open now than before for consolidation that would create a handful of strong and valuable lenders. A start is the merger of its associates with SBI. It will be tricky to forecast a turnaround in the fortunes of banks, although some bankers say this could happen in the first quarter of 2017-18.  Barring SBI, all public sector lenders have a price-to-book value ratio of below one. Until the dust settles, these rock-bottom valuations will keep calling to investors.",2016-08-15,5yRFwAXonxqCjpTtnGYJxN,"To foretell the timing of the turnaround of the public sector banks is tricky, although bankers insist that this would happen as early as the first quarter of FY18

7,0.2432,"For the third consecutive quarter, Asian Paints Ltds volume grew in double digits, buoyed by the performance of the decorative paints segment. This is impressive, given the subdued consumer demand environment. 
				   
				Consolidated revenue rose 9% on a year-on-year basis to Rs.3,590.16 crore and net profit increased by 18.5% year-on-year to Rs.552.56 crore. Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margins improved 220 basis points to 21.5%, courtesy benign raw material prices, but higher advertisement and employee costs restricted further improvement in operating margins. Revenue from the paint and industrial segments grew 10.03% and 23.68% year-on-year, respectively. A basis point is 0.01%.It has been a stellar quarter for Indias largest paint maker and that is reflected in its valuations and share price movement. Asian Paints is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 51.33, higher than peers Berger Paints India Ltd and Kansai Nerolac Paints Ltd. The stock has run-up nearly 30% on a year-to-date basis. But the key questions areis such a premium valuation warranted? Is there more upside left?Analysts have mixed views.Positive aspects of Asian Paints business model are priced in, but the risks of investments in new initiatives are not,  Religare Capital Markets Ltd said in a report.Asian Paints has earmarked overall consolidated capital expenditure of Rs.700 crore for FY17 and is augmenting capacity expansion in Mysuru. Also, it has revised proposed capacity plans for the Vizag unit and is now looking at setting up a plant with a maximum capacity of 0.5 million kilolitres, which will require capex of Rs.1,785 crore.Concurring with that view, Reliance Securities Ltd said that while it expects Asian Paints to deliver double-digit volume growth over the next couple of years, valuations appear to be expensive at current levels. One of the key risks would be a sharp increase in input costs, Reliance Securities cautioned. Raw material prices have seen some uptick in recent months and we need to monitor this trend going forward, the Asian Paints management said in a conference call. On a year-to-date basis, Brent crude oil prices, one of the key ingredients, have risen by 26%. On the other hand, Edelweiss Securities Ltd believes even if inflationary pressures come back, the company has sufficient pricing power to counter them.Asian Paints shares have outperformed the Sensex on a year-on-year basis.",2016-08-15,1ioAqcsK4fpxZA061FlAoI,"Asian Paints faces risks of investments in new initiatives because of a sharp increase in prices of raw materials

188,0.248625,"More movies, from more genres have done well in recent months and the big winners, as a result, are multiplex firms PVR Ltd and Inox Leisure Ltd. The companies also have the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) to look forward to. Not surprisingly, shares of both companies have outperformed the Sensex so far this fiscal year. The PVR stock has gone up 63% and that of Inox Leisure by 35%.
				   
				PVR will benefit with around 4-5% Ebitda margin expansion, if GST rate is at 18% while Inox Leisure will benefit with an approximately 2-4% Ebitda margin expansion, pointed out analysts from Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and is a measure of operating profit. For the June quarter, even though both companies saw decent consolidated revenue growth, profit declined a bit primarily on account of muted operating performance. Advertising revenue growth was slower than expected. PVRs advertising revenue increased 13%, slower than in the previous two quarters. This was mainly on account of an increase in the share of regional (Sairat) and Hollywood-dubbed (Jungle Book) movies during the quarter, explains Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd in its post-results update. Regional and dubbed Hollywood movies attract lower advertising rates compared with Bollywood movies. During the June quarter, a higher proportion of box-office collections came from Marathi movie Sairat and the dubbed Jungle Book. Inox Leisures advertising revenue increased by a low 3%. Thats because after ad rates increased in December 2015, markets have not yet adjusted. The fall in occupancy rates was compensated to some extent by an increase in average ticket prices for both companies. PVRs operating profit increased 5.4% year-on-year to Rs.117 crore while that of Inox Leisure declined 3.8% to Rs.62 crore. Both companies saw a decline in operating profit margin compared with last years June quarter. Despite higher other income and decline in finance costs, PVRs reported profit after tax declined 1.7% to Rs.43 crore. PVRs tax outgo was substantially higher. Inox Leisures net profit declined 1.3% to Rs.25 crore.Inox Leisure added five screens in the June quarter and intends to add another 54 screens for FY17 taking the total screen count to 479. PVR expects to take total screens beyond 600 (including DT Cinemas screens) in FY17, informs Motilal Oswal.The content pipeline remains healthy this quarter. Movies such as Jason Bourne, Suicide Squad, Mohenjo Daro and Rustom are expected to do well. Moreover, new screen additions will add to revenues. The only hitch is that investors seem to be factoring in most of the good news.

412,0.2494,"Global economic growth has slowed considerably in the past few years and black swan events have only aggravated matters. The US economy grew slower than forecast for the first two quarters of this year, and it is likely to grow at around 1.5% for the whole year. No wonder Chinese and Indian economies are getting the attention they are from the global community. However, some experts are worried that an untoward event might occur in China, hurting its development and, by consequence, the entire world.
				   
				China is still the main engine driving global economic growth. During the first half of this year, its economy grew at the rate of 6.7%, reaching 34 trillion RMB. Seven hundred and seventeen million new jobs were created in urban areas, retail inflation rose to 2.1% and per capita income rose by 6.5% nationwide. The economic structure continued to improve, with the contribution of the service sector to the economy reaching 59.8%. Transformation of the economic development pattern saw progress. Fiscal and financial reforms as well as the reform of state-owned enterprises also witnessed steady progress, and innovation started playing a bigger role in economic growth. Although the non-performing loan ratio of commercial banks rose to 1.81%,  the overall financial system remained stable with no systemic financial risk. Overall debt ratio of central and local governments stood at around 40%, which is quite low when compared with developed countries. The fiscal deficit rate was only 3%, still under the internationally recognized safety limit. The process of reducing capacity has already begun in iron and steel, and coal industries. The aim is to reduce production of crude steel by 45 million tonnes (mt) and of coal by 2.5 mt this year. Production of crude steel and coal will be reduced by 100-to-150 mt and 500-to-800 mt, respectively, in the next five years. This de-capacity process is aimed at improving the economic and energy structure of the Chinese economy, so that 1.3 billion Chinese people can lead a healthier life in a cleaner and greener environment. China is fully capable of achieving 6.5-7% growth this year, and its contribution to the worlds economic growth will remain around 25%. The new round of economic reforms, rapid urbanization, technological progress, improvement in quality of labour and deepening of international economic cooperation will support Chinas medium- to high-speed economic growth in the long run.However, owing to the large size of the Chinese economy and some structural, cyclical and external factors, the transformation and upgradation of Chinas economic development pattern will require more time. The country faces many difficulties in the task of promoting economic restructuring and upgrading, and even more difficulties in fulfilling the responsibility of boosting world economic growth.The good news, nonetheless, is that this year India is still the third largest engine pulling the world economy forward. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has focused on economic reforms and economic development since taking office, and launched many encouraging plans such as Make in India, Smart Cities and Startup India. He has travelled far and wide within India and visited various countries around the world. He is perceived as actively promoting economic cooperation between India and the rest of the world. The business environment in India has also witnessed improvement, and foreign investments have increased significantly; infrastructure has gained momentum, fiscal consolidation has strengthened, and inflation has come down. India, like China a few decades ago, is seeing the setting up of industrial parks, construction of new skyscrapers every day, and a continuous forward extension of railways and roads. India has remained the fastest-growing major economy in the world for the last two years. On the back of a great monsoon, this year is going to be a bumper year for Indians. Timely monsoon and bumper crops would help India achieve 8% GDP (gross domestic product) growth as hoped by finance minister Arun Jaitley. It would increase Indias GDP by nearly $180 billion, which may be only about $100 billion less than the increment of the US economy. It deserves mention that India has firmly taken over the role of the third engine driving global economic growth.During a meeting, Jayant Prasad, director general of the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, told Liu Jinsong, charge daffaires of the Chinese embassy, that our confidence in the future of Chinas economy is just like that in our own economic outlook. In the present era of profound economic globalization, our big world has turned into a small global village where the fate of every country is so closely intertwined with anothers that no one can go it alone. The Chinese and Indian economies are highly complementary to each other as reflected through increasing number of cooperation projects. Indias growing economy is actually helpful in easing the downward pressure on Chinas economy. Only if China and India help each other and forge ahead can they bring hope to themselves in a very depressed world economy and illuminate the world as well. It is always better to have more engines powering the worlds economic growth.

317,-0.2377,"The flock of frightened pigeons that calls itself Indias telecom industry had a violent reaction recently when their regulator set a cat among them.
				   
				The impending entry of a new fourth-generation operator would anyway mean a trip to the slaughterhouse for a few of the dozen existing players, some of whom are already making a run for the coop door. But thats a known risk. Its the threat of having to cede market share to billionaire Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Jio faster than imagined thats causing nervousness.That latter possibility has been raised by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of Indias (Trai) consultation paper on scrapping the compensation one wireless service receives for calls routed to it by another.That proposal to do away with the calling-party-pays system, the incumbents allege, smacks of bias. It would give a pricing advantage to a new network like Jio, which would be more likely to originate calls than terminate them. Meanwhile, Jio has complained that existing operators are sabotaging its ongoing beta trials by not offering adequate interconnection, leading to call drops.Incumbents have denied the allegation, and accused Ambani of running a service in the garb of testing. The dispute is fast turning into just the kind of melee the government, looking to hold its biggest-ever auction of spectrum a little more than a month from now, can ill afford.Also Read: Reliance Jio vs the rest: Trai, PMO dragged into the fightTo the extent the fracas is the harbinger of a bruising price war, its also bad news for shareholders of Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular, which together with Vodafone control more than three-fifths of the market. The quest to expand data usage on their networks ahead of Jios long-delayed entry has already caused prices to head south:While data usage is indeed picking up, capital expenditure is accelerating. Ideas net debt is almost 5.7 times annual earnings before interest and taxes (Ebit); its 3.3 times Ebit for Bharti. With Reliance boasting to the regulator that its $20 billion investment in Jio is already more than any of its competitors, incumbents have little breathing room.When Kumar Mangalam Birla, Idea Cellulars controlling shareholder, sought to streamline his fiber-to-finance empire, minority shareholders balked at the prospect of being asked to fund his money-guzzling telecom venture. Ambani, on the other hand, has been lucky. His petroleum-refining business is minting cash, so creditors are giving him the chips to spin the roulette wheel and grab those 100 million Reliance Jio subscribers he craves.The stakes are high, and so are anxiety levels. With the regulator adding to the uncertainty about future market share, investors can expect more volatility.

372,0.249,"When Anoop Kumar Sharma quit state-owned Shipping Corp. of India Ltd (SCI) in 2008 as senior vice-president overseeing the chartering operations after three decades with the Mumbai-based firm and joined Essar Shipping Ltd, he would never have imagined returning to his former employer as chairman and managing director.
				   
				Eight years hence, this is what has happened.A government that is open to trying out private talent in a company that runs ships where quick decision-making means a lot, cleared the path for Sharma to take a shot at the top post.While contemporaries and colleagues give him the thumbs up, it is not clear he would have got the top job at Shipping Corp. had he stayed on because appointments there merely went by seniority.A little before he left SCI, Sharma lost out due to the lack of seniority on becoming a director for bulk carriers and tankers at the company when interviews were held by the Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB), the government headhunter. He impressed the PESB, but the much senior K.S. Nair got the job.In a way, selecting Sharma, seen as a lifetime SCI man, would be a motivating factor for the rank and file of SCI. Bringing a rank outsider could have been a de-motivating factor for people who work for the company.It was not that the government has now hand-picked Sharmait ran a proper selection process by inviting applications, short-listing candidates, conducting interviews and securing approval from the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC). Sharma was one among the eight who were interviewed by a panel headed by Indias cabinet secretary.In a way, Sharma, who started his career at Shipping Corp., has seen the best of both the worlds. The rigid and often time-consuming decision-making process that characterized state-owned firms, keeping government oversight bodies such as the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) and the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in mind, on the one hand, and the greater operational freedom in the other.Whether Sharma can put his eight years in a private shipping company to good use at Shipping Corp. remains to be seen. Because, running a shipping company, a government-owned one at that, is a different ball game altogether.For instance, despite being a so-called navratna company, a tag that allows state-owned firms greater freedom from government control, Shipping Corp. just does not have the flexibility to buy used or second-hand vessels and sell ships for further trading, which is a normal part of the shipping business globally.Asset play requires taking quick decisions.There are times when selling a ship makes much more commercial sense rather than operate it at rates that dont even allow recovery of operating costs. This is one of the ways fleet owners shore up their financials in a depressed freight market. SCI, once a target for privatization during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, had never sold a ship for further trading since starting operations 54 years ago. Successive chairmen and managing directors (CMDs) have been reluctant to take a call on selling trading ships (which can be run for many more years) due to fear of agencies such as CVC, CAG and the Central Bureau of Investigation.If CMDs are given immunity from such oversight bodies, the company would be able to improve its efficiency and profitability by several notches. Similarly, buying second-hand ships requires securing time-consuming government approvals.Since April 2013, SCI had cancelled orders for building 12 new ships after shipyards jumped delivery dates. This allowed the company to preserve cash between 2011 and 2014 when it reported three consecutive years of losses.Shipping Corp. needs to re-deploy Rs.330.65 crore of refund money received from the shipyards on order cancellations which were originally part of the proceeds of the follow-on public offer (FPO) in November 2010. This money can only be used for buying ships because that was one of the purposes of the follow-on public offer.For close to a year now, the company has been looking for at least six second-hand ships but managed to buy just one shipan offshore oil exploration support vessel from a subsidiary of Indias The Great Eastern Shipping Co. Ltd. With ship prices at record lows, buying ships at low prices would help when the market picks up.Last week, the company issued a tender for buying a 7-11 year old suezmax tanker (called so because it can transit the Suez Canal fully laden) which can carry as much as 160,000 tonnes of crude oil. In the private sector, whether in India or abroad, ship acquisitions, both new buildings and second-hand, are never through tenders; they are always done through negotiations.Sharma will have to contend with such restrictions unless the government decides to ease them in the larger goal of professionalizing SCI.In much the same way as Shipping Corp., the government could consider hiring professionals from the private sector to run some of its state-owned ports that have always remained a fiefdom of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS).P.

400,0.2425,"When Britain voted to leave the European Union, it seemed like Tata Motors Ltd would be among the worst hit Indian companies. Its shares fell as much as 8% when the news hit the Street because of worries about the impact on its UK subsidiary, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR).
				   
				At first look, the companys June quarter results seem to revive some of those fears. JLRs profit before tax and exceptional items fell as much as 45% year-on-year, largely on account of adverse forex movement. In addition to the sharp fall in JLRs profit, the adoption of Ind-AS also worked against the company in the past quarter. Net profit on a consolidated basis fell by as much as 57%.But investors are likely to ignore these as one-off impacts and focus on the strong growth in JLR sales and the reception some of its new models have received in the markets.The company said in a call with analysts that the F-Pace model it launched earlier in the year has been received well and has a waiting period of three-to-four months. Launched in April this year, the F-Pace accounted for nearly 40% of total Jaguar sales last quarter. The XE did well, too, accounting for one-fourth of total Jaguar sales. In the Land Rover stable, the recently launched Evoque Convertible has created some excitement in the market.As a luxury car maker should, Tata Motors spends large amounts on research and development. With the recent success it has had with new product launches, it looks like these investments are coming good. To be sure, Tata Motors shares have risen by about 90% from its lows in February, when fears of a slowdown in China had hit investor sentiment. And the stock has not only recovered all of the losses since the Brexit announcement, but has risen compared with pre-Brexit levels.In the backdrop of improving sales and the success of new models, investors may ignore the large drop in the June quarter profit, since a large part of it was owing to currency fluctuations. The pound had depreciated sharply post Brexit, resulting in losses on derivatives contracts used by the company to hedge its exposure to other currencies. Besides, the restatement of assets and liabilities as on 30 June also led to forex losses worth £84 million.According to the company, a weak pound will result in losses only till the time the derivatives contracts it executed when the pound was stronger are in force. In the long run, a weak pound will work to its advantage, since JLR sells about 80% of its vehicles outside the UK. It does import 40% of its components, on which it will take a hit on the forex frontbut on a net basis, it will gain from a weak pound. Of course, Brexit could lead to other complications, such as incremental tariffs, but this depends on how the trade agreements are negotiated.Thanks to the adoption of Ind-AS, the profit for the year-ago June quarter was restated upwards by around Rs.2,500 crore, largely owing to the difference in the way gains/losses on forex derivatives is accounted for. Devoid of such a large gain this time around, profit fell sharply.",2016-08-28,uPBMemHoy2F3IKg63BGlGI,"Amid improving sales and success of new models, investors may ignore the large drop in June quarter profit as a large part of it was owing to currency fluctuations",23:36,"As JLRs new products impress, Tata Motors June quarter profit fall may be ignored"
292,0.121775,"The August sales numbers of leading commercial vehicle manufacturers are worrisome.Not only does it weigh down on investor sentiment towards this segmentwhich was the first to turn around in the auto sectorit also raises questions on the strength of the economic recovery.Market leader Tata Motors Ltd reported a shocking 17% year-on-year drop in the domestic sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles (M&HCVs) during August. It was also lower, compared with sales in July.Ashok Leyland Ltd, the second largest truck and bus maker, reported a 7.9% drop in sales in overall M&HCV sales, too.This is not sudden.Tata Motors sales hit a roadblock in May. It has not recovered since. Sales of Ashok Leyland have been sliding, too. One could argue that the segment clocked heady growth for nearly two years before falling and, hence, the high base has challenged growth prospects.If M&HCV and auto sales reflect the state of economy, then it questions the sustainability of green shoots of economic recovery, too.Further, although manufacturing in select sectors that back consumption has picked up, it has not enthused investment demand and capital expenditure.Further, heavy industries such as construction and mining are still limping.India Ratings adds that the robust growth in M&HCV sales in FY15 and FY16 was perhaps pent-up demand.Meanwhile, truck rentals have also fallen in the past few months.One could blame this on the cut in diesel prices in the recent past and a heavy monsoon that may have disrupted the movement of goods.However, a note by Reliance Securities on the sales numbers for August says that replacement demand, which was robust a few quarters ago after the long lull in truck sales, has tapered off. Meanwhile, the inadequate rise in freight rates and a slow pick-up in construction activity, along with a high FY16 base, has kept truck sales subdued. Growth in light commercial vehicle sales, though rising, has also moderated.Fleet operators appear to have another concern, too. The new goods and services tax (GST), when introduced, will no doubt reduce logistics hurdles and reduce time at check posts, thereby improving fleet productivity, too.So, perhaps operators may not feel the need to expand until GST comes into existence.A Tata Motors presentation highlighting its June quarter performance says growth in the freight rate index shows a decelerating trend since the December quarter of FY15 on the back of weak economic activity.This may weigh down on truck sales, unless there is a post-monsoon revival in economic activity.For now, one hopes that it is a seasonal blip.All eyes are, therefore, on the second half of FY17, which should set the pace of growth for commercial vehicles.",2016-09-04,buuWX52Vy2iLRf58Gq3n1M,Not only does the decline weigh down on investor sentiment towards this segmentwhich was the first to turn around in the auto sectorit also raises questions on the strength of the economic recovery,20:18,Drop in truck sales a reason for worry
273,0.242525,"Price discounts on online platforms and frequent sales drives are unsettling Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail Ltds (AB Fashion) premium brands business and driving a strategy rethink.
				   
				Sales at Madura Fashion and Lifestyle, which has premium brands, fell 3% in April-June, the second consecutive quarterly drop. As the company refrained from deep discounting to protect brand value, throughput volumes fell, impacting the units operating profit.Sales at Pantaloons, which operates in the value segment, grew 31%, helping the company register a respectable revenue growth of 8%. With the division seeing good traction, analysts expect it to continue to drive growth at AB Fashion and Retail.But it will be lopsided growthnot least because Madura is more profitable than Pantaloons.A significant part of AB Fashion and Retails capital is invested in Madura (roughly half of stand-alone assets are in Madura). The division generates more than half of AB Fashions revenues and weak performance is weighing on the overall performance.The company is recalibrating the Madura business.It is reducing fixed costs, increasing the season cycles and is driving digital transformation through the omni channel programme (shoppers can check unavailable inventory at stores and order online).The measures and inventory drawdown process are estimated to take another quarter to begin showing results, which means Q2 could also be weak.Aided by the wedding and festive season, the company expects Maduras performance to recover from October or in the second half of the fiscal year. But the street is sceptical. The stock fell sharply after the Q1 results and is yet to recover.That is due to weak pricing power. Discounts have become sales drivers. Online platforms continue to offer high discounts and retail stores are being forced to follow suit. Further, with the consolidation in e-commerce firms (such as the Myntra-Jabong combination), analysts fear the market will continue to see pricing pressures.To be sure, the problem is not typical to AB Fashion.The whole apparel and retail industry is facing pressure on prices and realizations.It looks like now that it is a new normal that there will be discounting, there will be schemes and you have to live with those and then really still ensure that you can make money out of it, Shoppers Stop Ltd told analysts last month.But companies are getting around this. Branded apparel divisions of both Arvind Ltd and Raymond Ltd registered good sales growth in the June quarter. It is a different matter that these companies are yet to attain decent profitability.But AB Fashions Madura is yet to even reach this stage.

427,0.00945,"The benefit that cement manufacturers got from low input prices in the June quarter, which translated to better margins, is likely to reverse. And some brokerages have started raising red flags about it. Cement companies should brace for some erosion at the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) level in the September quarter due to hardening fuel costs.
				   
				Data provided by S&P Global Platts shows that globally, the prices of thermal coal, the FOB Richards Bay 6,000 kcal/kg, surged from $50.283/mt in the beginning of the year to $62.445/mt in July. Richards Bay 6,000 kcal/kg NAR (net as received) is a grade bought by Indian buyers, especially cement companies. The chart represents the monthly average price of this grade of coal on a free-on-board (FOB) basis. This is the price the buyer pays to purchase coal and get the cargo loaded on to a mother vessel at Richards Bay Coal Terminal in South Africa.Similarly, average petroleum coke, or petcoke, prices rose from $45/mt in January this year to $81/mt in August. Supramax cargo of imported petcoke with typical 6.5% sulphur is delivered to Indias east coast port of Krishnapatnam. S&P Global Platts has been tracking the price of petcoke delivered to India on a weekly basis from March 2015 and this is highest price since then.Petcoke prices were trading at about close to $40/mt CFR India (CFR=cost and freight) in March this year. Cement companies found this price very attractive and started procuring in huge quantities, shifting from thermal coal. In fiscal 2016, total India petcoke imports stood between 3.5-4 million tonnes . But this year, in July alone, more than 1 million tonne of petcoke arrived in India, Deepak Kannan, managing editor, Asia Thermal Coal, S&P Global Platts told Mint.Maintenance issues with a few US refineries earlier this year tightened supply while demand continued to rise, leading to a steep increase in petcoke prices, while thermal coal prices have been driven by supply cuts and a shift in demand, he added.According to some experts, while it is certain that margins will begin to erode from hereon, it is difficult to quantify the exact impact now because some cement companies may have petcoke inventories acquired at low cost. Also, the hit on margins would vary from one company to another based on their usage of petcoke and coal.In the last three months, domestic petcoke prices have surged from Rs.1,200-1,500/tonne and players like ACC, Ambuja and UltraTech have increased petcoke usage to 60-75%; hence, operating cost is expected to harden from current quarter. Considering 50% of impact in current quarter, power and fuel cost is likely to surge by Rs.50-100/tonne. Further, increase in crude price also has an impact on packaging costs. However, looking at price trend of first two months of 2QFY17E, average price tends to be higher by 2-3% year-on-year, which may provide a cushion and arrest margin erosion, an analyst with Reliance Securities said.Further, Kannan cautioned that as the monsoon season ends, Indian buyers are expected to come back into the market for restocking, but they are staring at very high coal prices.The second quarter of the fiscal year is a seasonally weak one for this industry.

125,0.245275,"For years, private investors have lived with a rigid model concession agreement (MCA) that outlines the terms and conditions of a cargo contract at ports owned by the Indian government.
				   
				This may be about to change as India embarks on an ambitious programme for port-led development that entails the setting up of 400 projects requiring an investment of some Rs.4.5 trillion.The new MCA written by the shipping ministry seeks to replace the rigidity associated with the present one to deal with market dynamics over a contract period that typically lasts 30 years. In its place, the new MCA will give more flexibility to investors. Mechanisms are being introduced to better balance risks between stakeholders rather than subject the private developer to more risks than the port authority, as is currently the case. For instance, the new MCA will facilitate the extension or reduction of the contract tenure to deal with cargo volatilities. It will allow private developers to extend the concession period if the traffic demand is lower than forecast due to regulatory changes. Accordingly, if the actual average traffic for 15 years from the start of commercial operations falls short of the target traffic by more than 20%, then for every slab of 2% shortfall above the threshold of 20%, the concession period shall be increased by one year. Such increases, though, will be restricted to 10 years overall. The target traffic will be equivalent to 70% of the capacity of the project. For instance, in the event of a shortfall of 25% in target traffic, the concession period will be increased by two years. On the other hand, if the actual average traffic for 15 years exceeds the target traffic, then for every slab of 2% excess above the threshold of 20%, the concession period shall be reduced by one year and such reductions will be capped at three years overall. However, the private developer can avoid the reduction in the concession period by opting to pay a further premium equal to 10% of the gross revenue in the respective years. Port contracts are decided on the basis of revenue sharethe entity willing to share the most from its annual revenue will get the deal.The new MCA seeks to introduce the minimum guaranteed revenue (MGR) concept in place of the existing minimum guaranteed cargo (MGC) norms.A private developer is currently bound by the MGC prescribed by the MCA. Failure to achieve the prescribed MGC for three consecutive years can lead to termination of the contract.However, the minimum cargo levels may not be achieved due to a variety of reasons, including those beyond the control of the private developer.For a multi-cargo terminal, the MGR gives more flexibility. Because, even if the facility is not doing well in one particular cargo, it would be able to perform better in some other cargo which has a higher tariff. Whereas, in the case of MGC, the developer will only target a particular cargo of a certain capacity. This makes the contract more stringent. The MGR gives more flexibility because in case the tariff goes up or revenue rises, even with lesser cargo, the developer will be able to meet the MGR. In a way, the MGR concept takes the cargo pressure out of a developers mind. This could bring in revenue pressures. MGR, still, is the right approach because it makes more logical sense. The revenue share payable by the private developer to the port authority will be computed on the maximum/ceiling rate allowed to be levied on users. The discounts given to users are excluded from the calculation of gross revenue.However, if the discount offered to users is more than 10% of the ceiling rate, the private developer will be allowed to pay revenue share on the discounted tariff, with the approval of the port authority, according to the new plan.Storage charges will also now be excluded from the computation of gross revenue in a departure from the current practice.The original promoters of the project should hold 51% of the equity for three years after the start of commercial operations, 26% equity for another three years and thereafter exit the project completely. The promoters, however, can exit the project earlier by seeking a waiver of the 26% equity holding requirement from the port authority subject to achievement of performance parameters during the three years after commercial operations. In the existing MCA, the promoters have to hold 51% equity for three years after commercial operations and a 26% stake during the balance period of concession.Cargo-handling contracts to be auctioned by the Indian government-owned ports will allow flexibility to its operators to move to new tariff regimes than the one prescribed at the time of signing the deal.Currently, private developers are bound by the tariff guidelines applicable on the date of signing the concession agreement for setting the rates to be collected from users of the facilities, according to the current MCA.However, in the event the said tariff guidelines are either amended, revised or replaced by a fresh set of tariff guidelines at any time during the concession period, such amended, revised or fresh set of tariff guidelines, as the case may be, shall be the applicable tariff guidelines, provided the concessionaire (the private developer) exercises an option to recover tariff under such amended, revised or fresh set of tariff guidelines within a period of 30 days from the date of its publication in the official gazette, the shipping ministry wrote in the draft of the revised MCA.So far, in case the existing tariff guidelines are later amended, revised or replaced by a fresh set tariff of guidelines, it has not been made applicable to an existing private developer.  The large-scale overhaul of the contract terms is a big positive for port investors.P.

426,0.2467,"Undoubtedly, it was under A.M. Naiks stewardship that Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) earned a pride of place in the Indian equity markets.
				   
				From the time he took over the reins as chairman and managing director in 2003 and until date, L&Ts market capitalization has surged three times to Rs.1.425 trillion. This implies a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25%, which surpasses the 21% CAGR in the MCap index of BSE 100 companies during the period. Not just this. L&Ts stock, which trades at Rs.1,519, is reckoned by analysts, brokers and investors as the best play on the economy.The first major decision in his 13-year old journey at L&Ts helm to sell its cement business to the Aditya Birla group in lieu of the equity stake held by them in the firm, was creditable. For, it marked the end of takeover threats by big industrial groups and established greater employee and public shareholding. It also ended its presence in its only commodity playcement. Importantly, it marked L&Ts transition from a sizeable engineering and cement conglomerate into an indomitable edifice spanning several businesses such as hydrocarbons, heavy engineering, finance and information technology (IT).That said, L&Ts key focus area remains infrastructure, engineering and construction that today comprises about 45% of its revenue, compared with 83% from engineering and construction way back in 2004.Some analysts have been critical of Naiks diversification into unrelated areas such as finance and information technology (IT), though others consider these as cash-accretive businesses that would provide a hedge against economic recession.Proof of this was seen in the companys financial results during the last two years, when profit growth in the infrastructure segment dropped to single digits. Overall profitability got a leg-up from IT and financial services that did well and helped buck an economic slowdown.Again, Naiks decision to enter these businesses can be lauded in that the two recently announced public issues of L&T Infotech Ltd and L&T Technology Services will help unlock shareholder value as the money deployed in these businesses generates good returns.Further, Naik leaves behind a legacy of not just diverse businesses but diverse markets, too. From a pure domestic infrastructure firm a little over a decade ago, L&T is now present in new markets, such as West Asia. Today, almost one-third of its annual order inflows come from overseas, offsetting the slow pace of infrastructure development and order inflows in the country.Of course, in West Asia, the firms timing was perhaps wrong as the crude oil price crash stymied expansions in this region.L&Ts strength lies not just in diversification, but also in attaining size and scale in its businesses, enough to compete well.From FY03 till FY16, L&Ts consolidated revenue has grown at a CAGR of 19% to touch Rs.1.026 trillion. Growth in profit after tax has been even better at 23% CAGR.That said, sustaining fixed costs and overheads in the face of an economic slowdown is challenging. This is mirrored in its operating margin that has slowly started trending lower from 13-14% about a decade ago and is unlikely to improve in the near term.That apart, L&T could boast of a sizeable order book, enough to generate revenue for the next two years. But then, its balance sheet is also weighed down by the same. Economic slowdown and project delays due to tight liquidity conditions among customers has led to a surge in working capital requirements that is one-fourth its net revenue.The change of guard comes with huge challenges, too. Through Naiks tenure, L&T has been unable to churn out profits from some businesses. Its shipbuilding, heavy forgings, hydrocarbons, power and road subsidiaries are either loss-making or have wafer-thin profits.The scene is far from cushy in developmental projects that include roads, ports, bridges and urban infrastructure. For example, the FY16 annual report shows that while its road projects clocked single-digit revenue growth, high interest costs and depreciation translated into losses.The street is also concerned about the Hyderabad Metro project, mired in clearance hurdles and delays. It is likely to bleed once it is fully operational and weigh on L&Ts overall profitability.A Religare Capital Markets report says that decisions of capital misallocations in the recent past may not be addressed in the expected timelines. If so, it would tell on profitability. Meanwhile, analysts feel that FY17 will mirror the full impact of the new accounting (Ind-AS) norms, which could hurt profit growth given the more stringent provisions required.Be that as it may, Naiks successor is faced with the task of precariously balancing the juggernaut, until macroeconomic winds turn more favourable.",2016-09-09,x0cXVktXgElid8CsJZMZpL,"AM Naiks successor is faced with the task of precariously balancing the juggernaut, until macroeconomic winds turn more favourable

119,0.247775,"Steel Authority of India Ltds (Sail) physical steel sales rose by only 3.7% from a year ago in the June quarter, and even an increase in steel prices doesnt appear to have benefited it much.
				   
				The companys per-tonne steel realization shows an increase of just 0.5% over a year ago. What saved the quarter for Sail was a decline in its raw material costs.Sails revenue declined by 2.7% from a year ago to Rs.9,238 crore, while its operating profit improved to Rs234 crore compared with Rs89 crore. A sequential comparison is not possible due to the shift to Ind-AS accounting standards from the current quarter.Although its operating profit has improved, an increase in depreciation and finance costs, and a decline in other income has contributed to a loss of Rs535 crore versus a loss of Rs248 crore in the year-ago period.The substantial widening of its loss is what may have caused the 5.68% decline in its share on Friday.Sails share has been gaining ground in the past three months to 9 September,  and is up by 12.9% compared with a 21.4% increase in the BSE Metal Index. Although its operating margin has improved, it is not enough to cover the increase seen in depreciation and interest costs.The scenario for steel companies had improved with the imposition of anti-dumping duty and minimum import price on steel imports. The months of July and August have seen some improvement in Sails output, on a sequential basis. A gradual pick-up in sales will give investors confidence that its output can reach higher levels, justifying the investments it is making in adding to steel capacity.The outlook for domestic steel prices has improved with the government lending support and global prices rising. Domestic demand remains a worry though. In April-August, steel consumption rose by only 1.3% over a year ago, according to data from the Joint Plant Committee. However, an increase in exports and a decline in imports is supporting an increase in domestic production.Investors will be happy even if Sails output does not increase by much but is able to report a much higher jump in profits.

133,-0.24455,"Indias exporters and importers have for long grappled with the extra charges levied by container shipping lines and their agents in different ways.
				   
				So, it came as a surprise when Indias maritime administration, the Directorate General of Shipping (DGS), issued a circular last week that carriers and their agents have finally agreed not to collect some 25 different charges primarily concerned with imports.Pressure was building up on Indias shipping ministry after a Rajya Sabha panel questioned the government over the lack of transparency and reasonableness in the various charges levied by the shipping lines and their agents in export-import (EXIM) trade.The Prime Ministers Office (PMO) waded into the issue and asked the finance ministry to look into it. The finance ministry, in turn, asked the shipping ministry to find a solution.The shipping ministry then formed a committee led by a deputy DGS and comprising representatives from stake-holders in the maritime sector to identify and examine the grievances of the trade and submit its recommendations. The panel discussed some 58 extra charges levied by shipping lines/agents on import shipments alone, of which there was consensus not to levy 25 different extra charges including the winter season charges, terminal handling charges (THC) and inland haulage charges (IHC); the rest were either not accepted or were yet to be discussed.The committee is yet to examine the extra charges on the export side.The eventual outcome of the committee recommendations is that any charge that is not shown in the bill of lading cannot be charged or recovered.A bill of lading is a document issued by a carrier or his agent to acknowledge receipt of a shipment of cargo. But the question that is uppermost in the minds of exporters and importers is whether the consensus among the stakeholders and the recommendations of the committee are binding without legal backing.Still, what gives hope is the support of the Container Shipping Lines Association (CSLA), a key constituent, to the committees recommendations. CSLA is a lobby representing container shipping lines operating in India.On 7 September, DGS issued a circular acknowledging the consensus that led to the unanimous recommendations and reiterating an advice to the carriers/agents not to collect these 25 different extra charges involved in the transportation of EXIM goods as a good/best practice.Two of the 25 charges mentioned in the DGS advisoryTHC and IHCcannot be scrapped because it is a part and parcel of the container trade globally, says shipping executives.THC is a charge levied by the port and terminals from the shipping lines, which, in turn, recover it from their customers.While the THC levied by the government-owned ports on the shipping lines are a notified tariff item regulated by the Tariff Authority for Major Ports, or TAMP, THC recovered by the shipping lines from the customers is not regulated by any agency. TAMP does not have powers to regulate THC collected by the shipping lines from their customers. THC is supposed to be a reimbursement of the actual amount paid by the shipping lines to the ports and terminals. But in actual practice, that is not the case, according to shippers (cargo owners).Shippers say THC is a substantial amount and sometimes exceeds 70-80% of the ocean freight. There is a big difference between what they are paying to the ports and what they are recovering from customers as THC.Besides, exporters claim that the shipping lines are resorting to a so-called double-dipping by using THC to pass on the trade risk to the shippers.Typically, the money paid by the shipping lines to the ports is a part of their operating costs and is factored in the freight rates.Ocean freight includes the cost of loading cargo containers onto ships and unloading containers from ships. Despite this, the expenses incurred for loading and unloading containers are recovered from shippers separately as THC, leading to double-dipping by the lines.Exporters argue that the exorbitant THC charged by the lines contributes to high transaction costs, making Indias exports uncompetitive in the global market. THC is increased arbitrarily, often without consulting the exporters. The shipping lines have been hiking THC without disclosing the actual expenses incurred by them for the amount recovered. Overseas customers dont pay these charges as they are incurred within the country of export. Shippers have consistently favoured an all-inclusive cost without any of the extra charges and have sought government intervention to prohibit lines from collecting THC in India. Container shipping lines are against regulating THC and have refuted charges by shippers that they were over-charging customers by recovering a higher THC than what they were paying to the port and terminals.IHC is the cost involved in carting the cargo container from the ports to customers inland by road or rail. Both THC and IHC are globally accepted pricing practices. It has to be charged. Obviously, these cannot be scrapped. But if the DGS wanted this to be reflected in the bill of lading, thats a different issue, says shipping industry veteran Sabyasachi Hajara, a former chairman and managing director of state-owned Shipping Corp. of India Ltd. The problem of extra charges has more to do with agents and freight forwarders than with the carriers, according to experts. For container lines having local agents, the agents levy the extra charges which dont even go to the lines; they go to the agents kitty.  What the shipping ministry can insist on, according to Hajara, is that any charge that is proposed to be levied by the lines has to be registered with some agency such as the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) in the US. It has to be transparent and be available for anyone to see. In the US, nobody can complain because shipping service providers have to file their rates with the FMC, which has to include every charge and that is available for the exporters and importers to see.P.

				Rapid expansion helped the firm build a brand and scale up during the boom phase in real estate, but size has become its bane now.Small doses of positive news on the sales of non-core assets may have helped support the stock at lower levels. But this has done little to ease the balance sheet pressure and improve operating cash flows for the firm. Consolidated net debt has risen from Rs8,526 crore in  FY14 to Rs22,120 crore at the end of June 2016.Paring this down further requires sales recovery, which is not happening at the desired pace. In spite of news about a slow improvement in the residential real estate market, DLFs  June quarter net sales fell by 21% over a year ago. That was way below what the Street had forecasted.A look at relevant sales parameters over the last eight quarters shows how bad the situation is. The sales pickup is not enough to ease cash flow stress in the near term. Quarterly sales booked have been consistently low at 0.2-0.9 million sq. ft. with a downward bias. In fact, the June quarter had no sales from existing completed projects. On the other hand, Rs270 crore worth of legacy bookings were cancelled.Add to this the huge closing balance of existing projects. Although this has been reducing, DLFs June quarter closing balance was 21.9 million sq. ft. The balance sheet for FY16 pegs the inventory at Rs17,000 crore, which is a grave concern as it is nearly twice the annual sales (including lease income of commercial assets).Perhaps, the main issue is that the National Capital Region, where DLF has a major exposure, is saddled with huge inventory. The company is left holding a massive land bank in a region which may not be of much use in current conditions.According to Santosh Yellapu, senior research analyst (infrastructure) at Angel Broking Pvt.

The firm is, perhaps due to regulatory fears, now focusing on completing and delivering existing legacy projects than launching new ones. While this is good, it eats into its cash flows.Meanwhile, investors are patiently waiting for promoters to sell a stake in DLF Cyber City Developers Ltd.

				Mobius, who oversees the Templeton research team based in 18 global emerging markets offices, said he would give high marks for the performance of the Narendra Modi government so far. He cautioned that after  the passage of reforms, the focus would shift to implementation.We have got to see implementation of those reforms so that the economy can grow and accelerate and continue on the high growth rate. So, I would say India offers an opportunity and a pitfall, and we have to keep an eye out for it, he added in an interview.Edited excerpts: India has recently seen three big reforms over the past few monthsthe goods and services tax, a relaxation in foreign direct investment norms and the bankruptcy law being passed. As an investor, how do you view these steps? Are these the last of the big reforms from the Modi government?All those steps are very good and the tax one is excellent. Now, what has to be done is implementation, because implementation with each state is really the key going forward. So, we have to look and see how fast implementation can take place, because that will determine the success of this reform. But, we are very excited about these changes, and the impact, of course, will be far-reaching, and will really be very dramatic going forward. Thats really the key, because we must not overlook the fact that implementation is probably more difficult. Getting passed in Parliament is one thing, but getting each state to implement it, to reduce the bureaucracy, to make things more efficientthat is really the key to success.The perception among investors outside is that the Indian markets are expensive. We are very excited about the Indian market. If you look at global firms, youll notice that India rating has been increasing. We are definitely very focused on India. Growth rate is very high, and we believe that this will continue with the reforms that we have seen, and so we are quite excited about it.Which are the sectors in the Indian market that you are excited about?First one, of course, is techsoftware, in particular, is very good for us. Secondly, it is the consumer sector and, particularly with the tax reform, I believe that the consumer sector will really surge ahead. Also, the companies and industries that will benefit from the revolution in communications with RILs (Reliance Industries Ltds) entry into telecoms, they are going to make telecommunicationsdatacheaper for everyone in India. This will set off a revolution in innovation and, I believe, companies that can benefit from that will really be the ones that you would want to look at. A lot of that will be consumer-oriented.How do you see RILs entry into telecoms? Will it be a game changer?No question about it. It is going to be a game changer. By bringing down the cost of the telecoms, and by enabling people to utilize telecommunications in a bigger way, cheaper, faster and more efficient way, the entire composition of the economy will change. This goes for the financial sector, it goes for the consumer sector, even goes for the industrial sectorso, everybody will be impacted by this. Its true that the competition has been hurt temporarily with RILs entry, but I think they will step up to the plate and be ready to compete.Which sectors in the Indian market should one avoid at this time?I think it is not avoidbut we have to be very cautious when it comes to the finance sector. As I mentioned, the changes that telecommunications and mobile will bring about to banking and transfer of moneythat is going to have a big impact on the financial sector. Those financial sector companies that are not able to keep up, they will be at a disadvantage. The other area is the companies that have benefited from the restrictionsstate restrictions, border control restrictions, tax restrictionsthese companies are going to be impacted soon, and we have to be very careful. Again, the companies which had state monopolies in certain areas because of the inability of competitors to come inthose companies are going to be impacted, too. So, we have to be careful about not picking these companies. Recently, in your blog, you had said while India is growing faster than China, the latter continues to be your top bet among emerging markets.Thats mainly because of the size of China. You have a lot of liquid and large companies in the China market, and access is easy through the Hong Kong market, which enables us to get in and out of Chinese companies. However, with these reforms in India, you will see the rating on India increase. If you see our global funds, you will see that happening already.Overall, how worried or optimistic are you on China?I am pretty optimistic about China. I know people are concerned about the debt, about the leverage, etc., but at the end of the day, it is a communist-controlled society, and they can control the heavy leverage that a lot of the companies have. As you know, the big banks and big companies there are all controlled by the government... Its a big economygrowth is continuing not only because of government spending, but also because of private sector growth. So, were optimistic. But in a country like that, just like in India, there will be winners and losers. We have to be very careful in stock selection.In a recent blog, you said that in 2016, emerging markets have outperformed developed markets in US dollar terms. What is your take on the mid-term and long-term performance of emerging markets equities when compared with the developed markets?In the long term, there is no question that emerging markets will outperform for the simple reason that economic growth in emerging markets will continue to be at least double that of the developed countries. So, as long as that is the case, we can expect emerging markets to outperform. If you look at history, there is a correlation between market performance and economic growth. So, thats an important point to keep in mind. The other thing is that there is a slew of frontier marketscountries that are just starting out in the market economy adventure and these companies and countries will be growing at a very fast pace because theyre starting from a low base. That also will boost emerging markets generally.How do you see the emerging markets being impacted by the gradual increase in US interest rates?Its very important to look at the history of interest rates and emerging markets performance. If you compare the US Feds funds rate against the emerging markets performance, there is no real correlation. For example, the period between 1988 and 1993, interest rates went down and the emerging markets went up. Everybody expects a correlation between interest rates and performance; but then, if you look at the period from 2003 to 2007, interest rates went up and the emerging markets boomed. From 2007-09, the correlation held because interest rates went down and the emerging markets went down. So, its different from what you would expect. I think people are putting too much weight on the interest rate, particularly the US Federal Reserve rate and what the markets will do. There is a good chance that if the US Fed raises the interest rate, then emerging markets could outperform. You just cannot say that when interest rates go up, the market goes down. It doesnt work that way. History shows thats not the case.How do you rate the performance of the Modi government so far? Do you think it has delivered on many of its promises in terms of reforms, in terms of ease of doing business?I think there was too much euphoria when they were elected, and we foresaw that they would have difficulty in the beginning. So, we didnt expect the tremendous surge of reforms because we knew the barriers that they were facing in Parliament and so forth. However, the fact that they have been able to pass the tax reform and that they have been able to make changes is very heartening to us. To us, it indicates that the Modi government has done a pretty good job. I would have like to see (former Reserve Bank of India governor) Raghuram Rajan to stay on in the central bank. That is probably one negative to the Modi government; but then, if his successor continues on the same policies in a quiet way, then it should be OK. I would say we would give them high marks for performance.In India, what do you feel are the challenges and risks going forward?Again, it is not just the degree to which reform takes place. We have got to see implementation of those reforms so that the economy can grow and accelerate and continue on the high growth rate. So, I would say India offers an opportunity and a pitfall, and we have to keep an eye out for it.How do you see the private equity space in South-East Asia?Its very good. It is a great opportunity here in South-East Asia because there are so many new enterprises that are getting started and, of course, the impact of China on South-East Asia, in most parts, is very positive. China is, of course, the main trading partner, and as China surges ahead, these countries will be pulled along with them. So, lots of opportunities in the private sector area.",2016-09-22,kFXB0BUoKhEy9eTdD8w8JM,"Templetons emerging markets fund manager Mark Mobius says Reliance Jios launch will only  impact the telecom space, but also other sectors and the Indian economy",07:50,Reliance Jios entry a game changer: Mark Mobius
0,0.1302,"Global steel production rose by 1.9% from a year ago in August, up from the 1.5% growth seen in July, according to the World Steel Association (Worldsteel). China is the main reason why steel output has risen by this much, but global output ex-China too has risen in the past few months. Still, China dominates the steel discussion; in August, for instance, its output rose by 3% versus 0.9% for the rest of the world.
				   
				The rise in output may seem problematic, for Worldsteel had predicted in April that the global demand for steel would decline by 0.8% with Chinas demand declining by 4%. That appears to have changed, especially as China has taken steps to stimulate economic growth. ArcelorMittal said, in its June quarter results statement, that it expects global steel consumption to grow slightly in 2016, without giving a number. It said Chinese steel demand will benefit from growth in the infrastructure and automotive sectors, although real estate has lost momentum.Not just China, India too is contributing to global output growth. The ramp-up of new capacity at its major steel plants has seen its crude steel output increase by 9.4% in August. Sadly, its domestic demand is unable to absorb this level of steel output, as demand for finished steel increased by only 1% in August, according to data from the Joint Plant Committee. In the April-August period, it rose by only 1.3%.Thus, producers have been forced to export finished steel, although domestic sales fetch higher realizations. Exports of finished steel in April-August were up by 23.6%, with August alone seeing an increase of 87.3%. On the positive side, the governments steps to prevent the dumping of steel have benefited local steel producers on the pricing front.Globally, as in India, the main worry is when demand will recover to healthier levels to support this increase in output. Else, it will eventually lead to excess steel on the market that will spill into the global market and upset prices. While everyone appears to look to China to rein in its steel output, it has not shown much sign of relenting so far, although it has been promising to do so.In a move towards consolidation, this week came news that Baoshan Iron and Steel  (part of the Baosteel Group) will acquire Wuhan Iron and Steel, combining to create 60 million tonnes of steel capacity, according to Reuters. If this form of consolidation leads to more discipline on the production front, that is good for the world but if it leads to lower costs for the group while output grows unhindered, then it is of little use for the global steel industry.",2016-09-22,0A79xlrcIAFkQLkItzRBDP,"The rise in output may seem problematic, for Worldsteel had predicted in April that the global demand for steel would decline by 0.8% with Chinas demand declining by 4%",23:38,Steel output goes up and away
74,0.2487,"The first ever London Design Biennale opened this month at Somerset House. Around three dozens nations from six continents were invited to present installations on the theme of Utopia by Design. The India Design Forum spearheaded the Indian installation: Chakraview, curated by Rajshree Pathy. In an interview, Pathy who is chairperson and managing director of Rajshree Sugars and Chemicals Ltd and founder of the India Design Forum, spoke about the exhibit, and the precarious position of design in Indian life. Edited excerpts:
How did you approach the two very complex ideas of India and utopia, and then combine them for this exhibit?It was very challenging for us actually because the Indian utopia exists at multiple levels. We asked a few people around what is their idea of utopia. The answers are so diverse. It could be easily, somebodys meal. On the other hand, it could be a flat in Gurgaon. It could be a private jet. It could be your son going to a good school. Utopias for India are so diverse and yet we coexist with this tension that comes out of these diverse desires. Taking on from that premise, I needed to base this installation on something that had a thread of consistency in every Indians mind. Therefore, as a curator, I thought its best to have references to our mythology, to our learnings. And I tried to keep it as far removed as possible from any political or religious inferences.Then we looked at references to utopias in our mythologies. There are, in fact, many instances of utopian references. There was one reference to this ideal community called uttarakur. The other idea that came to my mind was the whole chakravyuha. We all go through a chakravyuhaevery individual goes through this manoeuvring of lifes passageways, ultimately to emerge into enlightenment or liberation. Therefore, along with the designers, we thought the chakravyuha would be a good manifestation of this installation. We eventually settled on Chakraview as the title. And then we interpret the seven chakras in our utopian view of India.You chose to stay away from religion or politics in your interpretation of an Indian utopia. This is an interesting approach. Do you think both of those thingsreligion and politicsstand between many Indians and the utopian life they desire? I think politics and religion play a role in any nations existence. You cannot remove the importance of politics and religion.One unique aspect of Chakraview is that it is one of the few exhibits here that are orderly and have a certain spatial symmetry. Does this reflect the fact that one common aspect of every Indians personal utopia is orderliness and symmetry? Is that the thread that binds all these visions? A harking for order?Symmetry is very important because it brings a certain order to disorderliness. It requires a certain discipline. I think in all the noise and colour of the exhibit, there is an order. There is also an element of government policymaking and collaboration in the exhibit. There is a video that connects the history of Indian design to the future of Indian policymaking.Why not? This is also a country-branding exercise. All such biennales are an opportunity to highlight what a country has to offer to the design world. It took a lot of work to get the government to endorse it. Because governments are used to trade fairs. They are used to exhibitions. They are used to conferences. Not design biennales.They want to sign MoUs (memorandums of understanding) at the end of something like this presumably?They didnt understand biennales. Im very happy that weve broken that constraint. We have put India on that map. It is about tourism, it is about textiles, it is about manufacturing, it is about everything else and this is quintessential India. We are a progressing country, and we have our own utopias. That is a challenge to show off. But this is all part of a broader plan you have for Indian design, especially as part of the India Design Forum.The larger agenda is to really create or design infrastructure which is both policy driven and private sector driven that will enable young designers. We have an NID (National Institute of Design) and a few other private design schools. Is that sufficient for a country the size of India? Absolutely not. I want to help designers to actually create businesses and add value to the businesses, allow them to market themselves and be Indian global designers as well. Today all your automotive companies have their design studios out of India. This has to change.What is holding us back from becoming a global design powerhouse?The problem is the mindset. We have to stop saying we are a poor country, we are a poor country. We have our multiple utopias because multiple problems exist, but you have to handle them at the same time. You cannot reduce everything to the common denominator of poverty. Once you reduce everything to a single metric then we start thinking: This is not better or that is not well, this is not important that is not important. Everything is important. We have killed the creative legacy of India by reducing everything to good or bad.Is that because of this tremendous utilitarianism that we have?Utilitarianism is fine, but design and innovation are part of utilitarianism. How can you design a pen, how can you design anything without thinking about its utility? There is a central philosophy: we must do more with less. We are obsessed with this. Why not do more with more? Instead we design products that do their job in the most basic ways possible. We dont care how many people will use it, we dont care about the different people who use a product, we dont care about ease of use. But we should. Unfortunately design is seen as being a superfluous. Design is art and therefore unessential. But that is totally wrong. Design is all about making functional products.Is that the problem. That we dont see the difference between those two things? Design and art?No, we dont see the difference. Even journalists dont understand it. Im forever asked this question. What is the definition of art and design? And then there are people who think that good design is all about handbags and shoes.Im passionate about it. We have lost our creative legacy which is why despite all the big, huge Indian conglomerates that are in IT, we will never produce a Steve Jobs. Because we only do jobwork. We have to learn to create.How do you stop that? How do you intervene? What intervention do you need?You need a change in the mindset. You need a government that thinks that creativity is important. That it is innovation and design that transforms cities into liveable harmonious spaces. You have to have more design schools. You have to have design thinking. You have to have design in your vocabulary in government. But we think good design is elitist. Because it is art. And we think art is elitist. While the procurement of art may be elitist, the people who make art are not elitist. Art itself is not elitist. We need to drill this into people starting from the government and downwards.",2016-09-23,AaHEkZsUBTt2iDpOuGaF6L,"Rajshree Sugars and Chemicals CMD Rajshree Pathy on growth of the India Design Forum, which she founded, and how to establish design thinking in India",23:47,Why cant we do more with more in India?: Rajshree Pathy
47,0.249125,"Rajeev Samant, 49, used to be a gin and tonic guy. Samants G&T, in fact, was famed at Stanford University, from where he graduated in 1990 with a dual degree, a bachelors in economics and a masters in engineering. I had a secret ingredient up my sleeverose and lime juice cordial, he says. At all the parties, I used to be the mixologist.
				   
				But this was more than 25 years ago, when he was yet to get acquainted with wine. Today, he is the chief executive of Sula Vineyards, Indias largest producer of wine, with a 60% market share. We meet in the lobby of a hotel in New Delhi Aerocity and settle down for a chat over cappuccinos and cookies.Sula will crush more than 13,000 tonnes of grapes in 2016, up 20% from last year, according to the company. Samant says they are well on track to sell one million cases in 2016-17.We continue to be the pioneers of the Indian wine industry. Every two years or so, we come out with a new wine that nobody has produced before, says Samant. We now export to more than 25 countries and are listed on the menus of Michelin-star restaurants. It says a lot about the quality that we have sustained over time.Yet there are new, urgent challenges. Global warming and climate change are among the biggest, he says.Sustainability is the companys primary focus area todayreducing waste, reusing and recycling its topmost goals. It has recently appointed a chief sustainability officer. Every inch of the roof of our Nashik plant is covered with solar panels, says Samant. About 40% of our power consumption comes from solar energy. We want it to reach 70% in the near future.Water conservation is his next target.In April, the Maharashtra government declared drought in 27,723 of the states 43,000 villages. Scanty rainfall and erratic weather patterns in the recent past have affected Sulas production as well. We recycle every single drop of water we use. But there is a long way to go, says Samant.Sustainability is an essential but a very new concept in India, he says. In fact, India is one of the major resistors at global climate change negotiations. We have to start changing our position. We have to find a way to reach our economic goals while being sustainable. India is one of the main sufferers of global warming, says Samant.Wine is particularly susceptible to the challenges of global warming because grapes are delicate, dependent heavily on the terroir of the place where they are grown. The soil is very important. It needs to be a good mix of clay, silt and sand. If its very deep clay, it is that much harder. Wine grapes love the Mediterranean climatewarm days, cool nights, dry weather, not too much rain, says Samant. *****Samant vividly remembers tasting the first bottle of wine that Sula produced, in 2000. I was sitting with Kerry (Kerry Damskey, the master winemaker from California who helps Samant in winemaking) on the veranda of our Nashik home. Are you ready? he asked. I nodded. And then he poured. The wine was cloudy. It was unfiltered. It was the first fermentation. But it tasted amazing. It was the best white wine made in India.It was the result of painstaking work done through a decade full of indecision, wandering, research, learning and perseverance.In 1991, Samant joined Oracle in Silicon Valley as finance manager but quit two years later. For a year, he backpacked through the US, Asia and India, before returning home to Mumbai in 1994 and asking his father for a job. He refused. Rajeevs father Suresh Samant owns Samson Maritime, a maritime and oil services firm. But my father said he would support me if I did anything on my own, says Samant. My father is a first-generation entrepreneur. Entrepreneurship, therefore, is in my DNA. Samant did decide to do something on his own. What, he did not know then. It was in Nashik that Samant found his calling. His father wanted to sell some land he owned. Samant asked him not to and started experimenting with organic farming. He grew roses, tomatoes and teakwood but soon realized that the infrastructure and economics were not with me there; organic farming is labour- and cost-intensive and unless it was done on a large scale, it wouldnt be profitable. He also realized that while Nashik was a cradle for table grapes, nobody was making wine. In that moment, everything came together, he says. Samant started growing table grapes in 1995 and wine grapes in 1996-97. The first crush was done in 1999.  Sula was founded in 1999, with Rs3-4 crore in seed capital, on the 20-acre plot that his family owned. The money came from family, friends and banks. We had to mortgage everything, says Samant. If the wine business didnt work, we could lose all of the Rs3 crore and some more. It was all or nothing. Today, Sula is worth more than Rs1,000 crore and buys grapes from 3,000 acres of vineyards, mostly under contract farming. Its wines are priced from Rs250-1,750 in Maharashtra. The medium-bodied, food-friendly Sula Cabernet Shiraz, the herbaceous, crisp and dry Sula Sauvignon Blanc, and the semi-dry Sula Chenin Blanc that works as a delightful aperitif are some of Sulas best-sellers. Samant says Maharashtra, Karnataka, Delhi and Goa are their biggest markets.I had never thought Sula would become this big, he says.Not surprisingly, he is now primarily a wine drinker. I have wine fridges at home and I have all my Sula wines there as well as the wines that we import, such as Hardys and Cono Sur. When he wants a break from wine, he falls back on the old favourite: a good gin and tonic with a dash of nostalgia. *****Sula has put Nashik on the world map, says Samant. Some people might disagree, but, in my opinion, Nashik didnt exist before Sula, he says. Today, Sula has the biggest non-religious tourist site in Maharashtra. We had 230,000 visitors last year.The company has also transformed the surrounding villages, providing a livelihood to locals. In Sawargaon village, at least one person from every family works for us in some way. We have among the highest proportion of tribals in our workforce. I just hope this can be sustained, says Samant.Samant is upbeat about the future. Consumption has been growing at about 20% every year for the past couple of years, and we have still only seen the tip of the iceberg. Wine is still less than 1% of the total alcohol consumption in India, and I see no reason why the industry shouldnt grow at about 10-15% every year in the next decade. There is a lot of potential for brands to grow. It is a great time to be in the business.So where does he sees Sula in, say, a decade from now? I dont know. If someone had predicted 10 years ago that I would reach here, I would have laughed at them, Samant says. Now I dont know where the limit is.",2016-09-23,6InfSbJq3ObxfblrwddaoL,Sula Vineyards CEO Rajeev Samant on his journey from Napa Valley to Nashik and the challenges that remain,15:19,Rajeev Samant: The Winemaker
118,0.24995,"At 62, Max Group founder Analjit Singh is trim and fit and says he is at peace with himselfa state of mind achieved because he doesnt feel the need for habra any more. Translated from Punjabi, that means he is no longer in a tearing hurry, as he was 30 years ago.
				   
				In January, Analjit Singh stepped down as chairman of the group he founded in 1982 and built into a Rs15,000 crore empire, with interests in life insurance; health and allied businesses; and speciality packaging films. In August, the board of Max Life Insurance Co. Ltd signed off on a merger with HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd that will create Indias largest private-sector insurer, with Rs1.1 trillion in assets.The promoters of Max Financialessentially Analjit Singh, his family and related family firmswill hold a 6.5% stake in the merged company and also get a non-compete fee of Rs850 crore. Analjit Singh, who within Max Group is called BAS (short for Bhai Analjit Singh, bhai being an honorific meaning brother), doesnt like being called a promoter, preferring the term sponsor, and seems to have achieved what most business family owners can only think of wistfullya degree of detachment from the business that allows him to take decisions without any emotional baggage.Analjit Singh stands out among the top echelons of business leadership in India for his ability to spot an opportunity like he did with telecom (Singh made Rs561 crore in 1998 by selling his 41% stake in a joint venture with Hutchison Whampoa Ltd)  and insurance and healthcare early on, and  more than that to quit when on top. He ascribes that to foresight and luck; but in reality, it is the mark of a businessman who can read the tea leaves.Analjit Singh, with the reputation of a serial entrepreneur, is also exploring new businesses, including information technology, real estate and education, under Max Ventures and Industries Ltd (MVIL). In an interview at his elegant home on New Delhis tony Abul Kalam Azad Road, Analjit Singh patiently explained his philosophy of life, his current state of mind and how the two relate to his business. Edited excerpts:As a strategic businessman, what are the things you are looking at now? When you look at these opportunities, what excites you the most?
I am not so sure that people in my situation look at entrepreneurial opportunities from purely a new-world perspective, as you pointed out. I think they look at entrepreneurial and future opportunities in rather a traditional way but think of these developments as enablers.What is the traditional way?
It is perspective of the market, key differentiators, compatibility of extensive weaknesses of the individual and the firm to be able to do something like this. So, therefore, in the traditional criteria of finding these opportunities what I meant was market, differentiator, opportunities, regulation...new factor, completely new factor in the decision-making set. The market is over-crowded. Everybody is in the business of over-promising and under-delivering. Capital is no longer a constraint like it was before. To some extent, even technology is no longer a constraint to those people who have some experience and network, you can find the technology. Anything is possible. If you run a world-class airline, technology is available. So, execution is the key. Team is a big factor. Team was never a question in our mind in the past 10-15 years. Today, if I were looking to be in a big business, probably the first question that I will ask apart from market and differentiator is people and team; and then you look at these new-world solutions that you are talking about as how they can become enablers to what they can do.Besides that, this question is not so pertinent to me. I am not super-engaged to be so rattled about what am I going to do and what will be my next big play. It is not top-most of my mind.But you will do new things, right?
I will do new things, but I will say I am not besotted with it anymore. My interest is more to tame myself and tame my mind and tame my life. Do you know this word habra? I have no habra.Were you like that when you did the diversification?
Of course not! Thirty years ago, I was always in a rush.If you forget about the future for now and look at the past 16 years, what are the things that you have picked up?
I dont call myself a promoter. I prefer the word sponsor. I think if a sponsor does not have an affinity with the business, that business unless by luck things take-off, I think that business drags. The affinity of a sponsor to a particular business segment is very important. If (Bharti Airtel Ltd founder) Sunil Mittal did not have an affinity for telecom or for technology, Airtel would not have been what it is today (Indias biggest phone services provider). If I did not have an affinity for being in the businesses of life and, therefore, focus on healthcare and insurance for 15-16 years, it wouldnt have worked.Affinity and focus leads to execution, passion capital, heavy-lifting, good team equals to success. Therefore, you can apply that mantra to anythingold world or new world. What would you call an old-world business? Pick anything. If I say to myself that I am going to leave everything in my life and get into steel and cement, I will find a new way of doing it and I will be successful in 5-7 years. I will find a way because the need for steel and cement is not gone. If you do it as another unit with the traditional way and traditional people, it is a recipe for disaster. So, we have to find an IndiGo (Indias biggest airline) way of getting in steel or cement. IndiGo is a very good example of what I am saying. What is the revolution and reinvention of being in the airline business? People have been in the airline business. They are in the airline business. They will be in the airline business, but most companies fail. So, why is IndiGo successful? Do you think (IndiGo co-founder) Rahul Bhatia goes and fixes the tyres of the plane every day? No. But somewhere between Aditya (Ghosh, IndiGo president) and him, the way they work is set. So, the way we work in insurance and healthcare is set, and everybody then would perform to that tune. Thats because you have affinity. Thats a clear lesson and experience that I can share.Somebody asked me the other day that you are not even now non-executive chairman of your companies. I am of the MVIL (Max Ventures India Ltd) because I am having fun again after 30 years to nurture a new company. Of those, you are of Vodafone.My point there was: to be a non-executive chairman of a company where you are a sponsor is very different from a non-executive chairman of a company where you are not a sponsor. My remake, role, life, expectations, contact, engagement, communication has to be very different if I am a non-executive chairman of a Max company. The deliverables and expectations are different when it comes to  being non-executive chairman of Vodafone. I am not a sponsor. They dont have the same expectation.When do you as a promoter decide that it is time that you should become a sponsor? Let us assume that this second wave of successful diversification that you did were not successful, would you still be saying all this?
So, in a way, it also gets linked to your expectations from future and living with disappointments from your past. Thats in a way what you are saying. I think the honest answer has to be that if the outcomes were not as exciting as they have been, I think, I would have not been as restful in my mind about it as I am appearing right now. I think thats possibly the case, but it also means in my current way of thinking that I would have to work harder at myself to become restful about the disappointments of the past.So, luckily for meand luck is a factor or the blessing that I havethe way I see it from nature and everything else is that these have moved reasonably in tandem. If they had not, the stretch would have been more and one would have to work harder to overcome those disappointments.Is there someone else in your fraternity who has done this really well? Is there a role model?
I wont go to the extent of saying whether I have a role model. I wont say that I am looking at somebody and say look how he did it. But I can tell you who has done it and done it very successfully. He is Vikram Lal (promoter of Eicher Motors Ltd). He is very restful and peaceful as a person. Look what has happened to Eicher. He wanted a particular life for some reason and he went after it and he has got it.I so solidly believe in impermanence that for me to be attached to a business, in this case, life insurance, it is stupid to be attached to it. When life is impermanent then what is this stigma about a business being permanent. Today, when you look at it, the power of this sector in this business is moving to banks. Whether these (insurance) companies are going to be profitable or not will not be because our premiums will get higher. We have the highest persistency (a measure of policy renewals) in the country84%. It is unheard of. The No. 2 company is 63%. So, I cant have more persistency in this business. The banks are now controlling distribution virtually. So, the only way to improve profitability is expense management. So, power shifting from agency to bankers, premiums not going up, expense management, regulators everywhere in this world are tightening the screws on the companies. Solvency margin, shareholder profits, expense allowance and disallowance, participating account versus shareholder account. No. 3 some sort of going back to expense management and market share, some sort of geographies have emerged for different companies. We are very strong in Gujarat; Gujarat is our second or third largest territory. But, more or less, we are more strong in the north and the south than we are in the west or east. HDFC (Life) is more strong in the west and the south than they are in the north. So, if you take the bank they are, you take the opportunity to consolidate and, therefore, cut some unessential costs and you take the link and fourth, product. In our time, we were heavily into protection and savings products. Even today, 80% of our business comes from protection and savings products, not from ULIPs (unit-linked insurance plans) and the like. HDFC is other way around, may be two-third or one-third.These are the four things that I saw writing on the wall about. And I have to tell you that when as a sponsor, among the 23 or 24 companies that are in life (insurance), if you take the balance sheet of the sponsor, we must be one of the smallest, I think. So from being in that position to sitting at No.3 of 23-24 with all the names you know sitting below us, you can get spoilt; and then, one fine day, because of these four factors, nobody gives you notice of failure in life like you never get notice of death.The same is in this business, some things just happen, and they change and then all of a sudden you say, oh shit what has happened?Six months ago, we were like this. And you come from 3 to 6 to 8 to 9. I dont want to take that chance; but then, it will go back to the question you asked me that if at the end of all this it was not good, would you have felt the same thing and I would have said no and I would have to start again, building again. I can see it happening, but my responsibility is I must not let it happen. Here is my opportunity that God has sent to me, I must take it.But you do take impulsive decisions? You do take decisions on the basis of your instinct?
Of course, you do.In South Africa, for instance.
Of course, I did. But hang on, yes and no. The impulsive decision that was taken about South Africa was not for business. The impulsive decision was to want to be there and enjoy the location. Like I may have a home. So, that was the impulsive decision. When it started to go away from becoming a holiday home or retreat to business, then I am very conscious, not impulsive. So, today that operation is being run exactly like any company of the Max group, with a board, people, CEOs, accountability, targets, budgets, matrix and data.Is it a part of the Max group?
No, no, private. Max has nothing to do with it.Could you elaborate a little bit, what is it about?
It is about hospitality, lifestyle, hotels, rooms, agriculture, plums, wines, almonds, wine-making, selling wines, three hotels, beer. We have a similar property in the UK. The first property is Linthwaite (Lake District Hotel, Linthwaite House), which is in the UK. So, we will grow in the UK. We have just acquired it in April. On 25 April, we took over.Whats the vision for it?
I have always wanted to be in the hospitality business. When I started vision 2000 of Max, I picked four areas: it was insurance, healthcare, education and hospitality. When we got cracking on insurance and healthcare, we did not have five rupees, or five minutes or five calories of energy to invest in anything other than insurance and healthcare; so we left it at that. In a way, Antara (homes for senior citizens) and remotely Vana (wellness resort) were born out of this idea of hospitality. And now, I am starting my life in education. Education is one of them, but it is a little too premature to talk about. In education, we have started some work. Are we engaged in it? Yes, but what are we going do, I dont know. But we have decided to be in that sector, so I dont know whether its 0 to 11 or KG to 16.Is someone thinking about this?
Yes. Very much. But just now, in August, its too soon for me to say whether its going to be Boeing or Airbus or north only or all India or only abroad... But it will be top three. I just like that expression of top three. And it should be, otherwise whats the point?Why are you interested in the real estate business?
I have a bit of khurak (itch) here. Actually, my grandfather was in the contracting business. That was my great grandfathers business in Pakistan. The bhai family were contractors. They built the road from India to Burma as a case in point. So, even now, you go to Lahore and all, and you will see a lot of buildings built by them. People in the street remember them as a family. So, I have a khurak for civil, real estate and stuff. I like land. I like construction, I like design. I like building. Every time the economy is on the cusp, and every time we talk about India being the next big thing... there are sections which are being talked about such as manufacturing, real estate, education... Do you see the economy like that?
I do and on the manufacturing side, I cant tell you anything today. I hope I can tell you in 60 days. We will, if all goes well, we will be in that space, in the prime ministers central part of his vision... Make in India. I will give you a beautiful project, if it succeeds, I dont know, I cant tell you today, we are working on it. I cant tell you what it is today. But if it succeeds, Mr. (Narendra) Modi will use this as an example of Make in India.Manufacturing is huge right? Its like a huge umbrella.
Our manufacturing space is only in one sector, which is polymers area. I am talking about that area, I am not talking about planes or furniture or phones or cars. Lets see. See, we never looked at anything else all these years. Thats why I coined this expression that I will look now at WWOBwider world of business. Education is that. Differentiated real estate is that. Investing is that. Everybody did investment. Other than financial services companies, people didnt use investing as a business. And you dont have to be financial investor to invest. So, investing will be a vertical of ours. Could be in shoes, could be in water, could be in plants.Do you see growth opportunities in the healthcare business?
Huge growth opportunities. Healthcare, if done and executed right. But most people will not be able to get it right. Most people will try and fail because of the population in our country, because of a very small percentage of it that can actually access healthcare, because of technology in this sector.Answer to your question is Alpha. But we worked 10-15 years to create that foundation. In Saket we will build the single largest hospital in Asia. But why we have not broken the ground there because we are not designing the hospital that is not so difficult to do. We are designing an ecosystem around Saket with a world class company who is doing all the planning and master planning for us.Which is this company?
HKS Architects. So we would change the shape of that part of Saket.So its a complete revamp?

6,0.247975,"Reliance Industries Ltds (RILs) announcement at its annual general meeting of the imminent commercial launch of services by its telecom unit has offered a fresh leash of life to the companys shares. 
				   
				The RIL stock has risen 9.5% since 2 September to Rs1,109.35. During this time, the S&P BSE Sensex index has fallen 0.8%.Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds long-awaited commercial launch has reduced the prolonged period of uncertainty that surrounded this venture. While it was clear that RIL was betting big on the telecom sector, there was no clarity on the launch date or  pricing strategy. Both questions have now been answered, and some analysts are excited about the companys prospects of gaining reasonable market share.To be sure, Jios success cant be taken for granted, especially as far as returns from the venture go. In a recent interview, RILs chairman Mukesh Ambani suggested that Jio was targeting a return of 18-19% on capital. That wont be easy to achieve. Analysts from Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd indicate that achieving that would require revenues that are close to market leader Bharti Airtel Ltds; and a similar Arpu (average revenue per user) profile as the top three companies in the sector (around Rs210) at Bharti Airtels subscriber base (250 million). We believe such returns can be difficult to achieve in the first four years, they wrote  in a note to clients on 19 September.But Jio isnt the only reason for the renewed excitement around RIL shares. Benchmark Singapore complex gross refining margins (GRMs) have surged this month. GRM is a measure of profitability for refining firms. According to an analyst, Singapore GRM, the difference between the per barrel price of crude oil and the value of products distilled from it, touched $7 a barrel on Friday. In the June quarter, average GRM was at $5 a barrel. RILs refining business contributed as much as 68% of the companys stand-alone earnings before interest and tax in the June quarter. Additionally, RIL is also expected to benefit from higher light-heavy and lower Brent-Dubai spreads.Besides, analysts expect it to generate high free cash flow (FCF) from 2017-18. RIL is coming out of its capex phase, which in our view will pave the way for a multiyear cycle of strong FCF generation averaging $5 billion per annum over F1Y8-20, implying >11% FCF yield, wrote analysts from Morgan Stanley Research in a report on 25 September. RIL will benefit from the start of earnings delivery from downstream, which we expect to add ~$3.2 billion in Ebitda by FY18, assuming oil prices remain low at $50 a barrel. Ebitda, or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, is an indicator of operating profitability.But note that despite the recent outperformance, investors have lost out considerably from a long-term perspective.  The RIL stock has underperformed the Sensex in the last seven years by a huge margin. Currently, one share trades at 12.6 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year.

343,0.152975,"June quarter results are not easily comparable on a year-on-year basis due to the change in accounting standards for non-financial companies from 1 April 2016. Even so, on a relative basis, small-sized firms remain laggards vis-à-vis large and medium-sized companies.
				   
				This is interesting especially in light of the ongoing rally in mid- and small-cap stocks. Of course, while there will be a variance in the performance of different companies and sectors, as a category, small firms have done quite poorly. The chart shows net sales and operating profit growth of listed companies in the June quarter. Banks and financial institutions have been left out because their businesses are very different and they have been affected by the clean-up of bad loans started by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Firms in the oil and gas sector have been excluded because of the volatility in their earnings.These non-bank, non-oil firms have been divided into six categories based on the size of their revenues. As the chart shows, the growth in net sales and operating profits for small-sized firms has been dismal in the June quarter. Firms with net sales of below Rs100 crore reported a 12.3% decline in revenues on a cumulative basis, while companies with net sales of over Rs1,000 crore reported a 2.1% growth in revenues. The subdued performance of smaller firms is also reflected in bank credit data. Latest RBI data shows that bank credit to large industrial units grew on a year-on-year basis while that to medium and micro and small industrial units declined.Despite the unimpressive earnings performance, many mid-cap and small-cap stocks are trading at expensive valuations after the sharp run-up that they have seen this year. But that, according to some experts, is largely driven by the underlying bullish sentiment in the market rather than these firms earnings.According to a recent Kotak Institutional Equities report, earnings will become more relevant as the effects of global and domestic macro factors fade. Domestic positive events such as implementation of the seventh pay commission recommendations, a good monsoon and a decline in interest rates have partly played out but are largely priced in, and the markets focus is likely to shift increasingly to earnings and fundamentals as the scope for re-rating of multiples is quite limited, the report said.As such, investors should be increasingly cautious about riding the mid- and small-cap rally blindly.",2016-09-26,m53fkCkiFeDPkBvq5zyYjM,"while there will be a variance in the performance of different companies and sectors, as a category, small firms have done quite poorly.",23:34,Small firms remain on a weak footing in June quarter

				Ambani, who introduced Anmol as the grandson of Dhirubhai Ambani, said he had been lucky for the firm and its investors as its stock price had rallied since the 24-year-old was named executive director in late August.The mood was cheerful at the AGM with a packed house. The junior Ambanis appointment was welcomed by shareholders and a few elderly ones even gave him their blessings. Anmol has brought the group and, specifically Reliance Capital, tremendous luck, as the stock price of Reliance Capital, has risen nearly 40% in just a few months since the induction of Anmol onto the board, Anil Ambani told shareholders at the AGM.Ambani said a key task for Anmol and the young team of RCap would be to see how they embrace technology to drive the company further.Also Read: Reliance Communications sees debt falling three-quarters in a year

305,0.248875,"Kolkata: Giving his group a new identity five years ago, Sanjiv Goenka said he was breaking away from legacies to build new ones. 
				   
				Less than a year earlier, he and his brother Harsh Goenka, chairman of the RPG Group, had partitioned between themselves a bunch of family-run businesses and personal assets spread across India.Things were still volatile within the extended Goenka family when in July 2011 Sanjiv Goenka announced the launch of the RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group, creating a new identity for the companies managed by him.Five years on, as he reflects on the cultural transformation of the group, Goenka says his group has earned the right to grow by improving efficiencies. The task was to shift focus from revenue to efficiency, and Goenka turned to consulting firms McKinsey & Co. and Boston Consulting Group for advice on how to lead this transformation. In the process, he ruffled a few feathers within the group. Fathers long face notwithstanding, he led the transformation, Sanjiv Goenka said, referring to the late Rama Prasad Goenka, who died in April 2013. Edited excerpts from an interview:What was the mandate for the consulting firms?Historically, the undivided RPG Group was focused primarily on revenue and not on operational efficiency. Because previously we operated in a protected environment, efficiency was not as relevant as it is now in a highly competitive environment.But once the partition happened, we brought in McKinsey & Co. and Boston Consulting Group to advise us on two things: structurally, what we should do to grow and operationally, how to improve efficiencies. The two firms worked across the group.Internally, at that stage, I took a call that we will not expand unless we could manage the expanded capacity in the most efficient manner by global standardsno growth at all, unless operationally we could make the most of it. So, breaking from tradition, I said we have to earn our right to grow.It initially took a lot of courage, a lot of self-assurance to take that standto say, for instance, that we will not chase ultra-mega power projectsbecause I was swimming against tide. But it was clear in my mind that we will not add scale only for the sake of scaling up. We will instead focus on how to get our house in order, weeding out inefficiencies.So, we started to have two review meetings a month for every company: one to discuss operational efficiencies and another to review strategic initiatives. These were unknown in our group previouslypeople here were rarely asked questions.How did your employees react?There was, for the first couple of months, some resistance from within the group. But that was only for about two months or so.One day, three of our CEOs (chief executive officers) and a CFO (chief financial officer) walked into my room and I immediately realized something was amiss. They said that I had started to act like the owner. So, I asked them if I should not. They said, of course, I should, but at the same time, they said they felt that I had stopped to trust them. By the time I met my father later in the day, they had taken the matter to him. And with a long face, he told me that I had hurt key people in the group and that he wasnt happy about it at all.To my mind, these people didnt resist change because they were incapable of coping with it. They resisted the change because they were being forced out of their comfort zone. The tussle went on for about two months, but after that, everyone rallied around the change.Today, we are a leaner and more efficient organization of some 52,000 people. The average age of our CEOs now is 50 compared with 65 previously.How has the group gained from this change?Traditionally, executing projects ground upor greenfield ventureswas not our strong suit. But in the last five years, we have executed several projectstwo power plants and two carbon black facilities, to name a fewand all of them have been completed on time and within budgets.Then McKinsey advised us to get into business process outsourcing (BPO), and we came across the Firstsource opportunity. We closed the acquisition within four weeks. We have turned around Firstsource, which was effectively in losses at the time we took it over, to deliver profits in excess of Rs300 crore in three years.We have pared its indebtedness from Rs2,400 crore at the time of acquisition to Rs600 crore. And we have done all these by scaling up competencies.As a group, our revenue has jumped from Rs7,800 crore five years ago to Rs18,000 crore. Our gross assets have gone up by Rs20,000 crore to Rs32,000 crore, and if you look at annual cash flows, our Ebidta (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) has gone up from Rs1,200 crore to Rs3,500 crore.And by the end of 2018-19, the groups net profit is going to go up from Rs1,500 crore to Rs2,200 crore as Spencers and the Chandrapur power station starts to turn in profits. Its been a quiet period, but at the same time, a period of intense growth.How is Spencers doing?Spencers has just turned Ebidta-positive. Every month, it is making enough money to meet all costs except interest on its loans. The outstanding loans arent big and very soon we will pay off everything. I am happy that because of Shashwats (Goenka) personal intervention, we have managed to pare costs by about Rs300 crore. (Spencers Retail Ltd, an arm of CESC Ltd, runs department stores.)Phillips Carbon Black also appears to have turned around...Yes, it is now turning in a profit of Rs10 crore a month. We have completely reinvented the business. Whereas previously feedstock used to come from the US sailing for six months, we now source it from other countries which are closer by. The biggest problem with the earlier arrangement was inventory losses. Now, our working capital cycles have shortened, and we dont have the problem of booking losses even before the feedstock had arrived.What is the strategy for CESC going forward?We have decided that we will avoid businesses that are government intervention intensive. So, for CESC, the future lies in distribution. We generate about 2,500MW currently, which we will increase to 3,000MW, but our focus will be on expanding our distribution business. The Chandrapur unit, which had some difficulties earlier on, is coming out of the woods. We now have buyers for almost its entire capacity, which means all our costs are covered, except interest.And Saregama?It is being transformed into a Mumbai-headquartered production house, generating content for online consumption. With data getting cheaper on every network, we are of the view that the demand for content is only going to grow. So, from being one of the richest repositories of Indian music of different genres, we are turning ourselves into a production house, which will also leverage our strengths from the past. Currently, 14 films are under production by not-so-famous directorssay by people who have assisted award-winning directors. Each has a budget of Rs1-1.5 crore and is to be produced in 2-3 months. I am not saying that they are not to be released in theatres, but the primary aim is to release them online.

150,0.2477,"There seems to be a bright rainbow over Escorts Ltd, after the rains. From June, when it was certain the monsoon was on track, until now, the agri-machinery manufacturers stock skyrocketed 123% in just three months.
				   
				Many factors came together to fuel investor confidence, which continues in the companys favour. At the forefront is the strong recovery in tractor sales on the back of a normal monsoon after two successive failed years. From April to August, tractor sales jumped by 17.5% year-on-year, with August sales alone soaring 55%.And this momentum is likely to remain through this fiscal year as the company expands its presence in the southern markets, which have steadily bucked the slowdown and outperformed growth rates. Meanwhile, Escorts continues to grow in its stronghold markets in the northern and central belts.The sudden turnaround in tractor sales after several quarters of contraction is a reason for re-rating the companys stock. In fiscal year 2016,  Escortss net revenue had contracted on the back of declining tractor sales. Its valuation had so far tailed that of other farm equipment manufacturers like VST Tillers Tractors Ltd, as other divisions dragged overall performance. However, at current levels, the stocks one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple has doubled to around 16 in a span of six months. Another fillip to valuation comes from the managements decision to sell the loss-making auto products division which was bleeding and a drain on profitability for several yearswhich has signalled its intent to focus on the companys core business.But then, profit expansion is important to sustain the current valuation. Yes, besides farm equipment, Escorts is focusing on revving up revenue growth in other divisions like construction machinery and railways too. A slew of new products have been planned across these segments to improve utilization and improve profitability. However, this may take some time to start contributing to profits in a big way.A key hurdle is that the company is saddled with high costsa function of low output and high fixed expenses too. Forecasts by the management to trim raw material costs and employee costs through a voluntary retirement scheme are likely to give a leg-up to profitability. Analysts have pencilled an operating margin of about 9% by FY18twice that of FY16. The caveat, however, is that with nearly 85% of its revenue dependent on the vagaries of the monsoon, the stocks earning trajectory will be cyclical and unpredictable. Unless Escorts is able to stabilize profit margins over a longer term, the stocks valuations may see wide fluctuations.",2016-09-29,KHbAjUP1ySXtnmnSCz5pnJ,The sudden turnaround in tractor sales after several quarters of contraction is a reason for re-rating the companys stock,23:28,Margin expansion key to support high valuation at Escorts

Still in the incubation stage, FCB Play will primarily be creating audio video content, branching into on-ground and even stand-up acts.

The mandate for the Mumbai office is not only doing deals but also help the global portfolio. India is a very key market which they look for market access or a place to manufacture things, sourcing or from supply side. Some of our portfolio companies have also made add-on acquisitions in India.You have only done four deals in the region while others such as TPG, KKR, Blackstone have raised Asia- or India-dedicated vehicles and have been extremely prolific. One would argue the capital allocation from Advent has been slow in the region and that India is not a key market for you.I would turn it differently. We are a true partnership, consensus model, and we try to take that slowly and do it steadily. Clearly, if you raise dedicated funds for the region, then the local team is under huge pressure from day one to put money at work in that region. Actually, what we have seen in our global fund, pre-crisis, post-crisis, and so on, that these regions and countries and sectors dont go in sync. So if you see, what we call dynamic capital allocation, the various funds and which sectors the money goes in and which countries, that can vary from fund to fund.Our model is that we have our own way to find businesses and build businesses. But then, we are agnostic where they are, which size they are; so thats why we felt the advantage of having a Mumbai office as part of the global fund which gives us the benefits of building sustainable businesses without being under pressures.But your capital allocation pattern suggests its pretty much spread across Europe, America taking chunk (40% each) and remaining, about 20%, coming to Asia?We have 180 investment professionals globally, and we have five chosen sectors that we like globally for investments and all of the colleagues look globally for investments. We have no macro overlay. When our investors ask us the same question, what is your capital allocationEurope, the US, Germany, Asiawe dont have. But then, they ask us you must have sector allocationhealthcare, TMT, industrialswhich also we dont have. We have a different way of doing what an Advent deal is. And when we find these deals, we do them irrespective of where they are.So, there is no portfolio construction where we say X% has to go somewhere. What ends up happening is that somewhere 40 Europe, 40 West and 20 Asia, that more happens, but we are not being prescriptive or aiming for these.Clearly in the healthcare space, we have invested in generics quite a bit. Of course, you have the Mumbai team on board, and if you take the global centre of excellence for generics it is in India.How important is India as a market for you?Clearly, very important because its a very big market and fast growing. It is relevant not only from a domestic perspective but also from an international perspective. When we started setting up a team here, building an office, we took a long term view. Currently, the outlook is great if you see various metrics: the stock markets, M&A volumes, the GDP, the wealth being created and so on.On a relative basis, if you compare developed and developing market, India definitely stands out. Lot of the acronyms that emerged such as BRICS vanished but the shining spot globally is clearly India. There is a lot of progress both on the political side and the value being created in this economy.Does that mean you will enhance your commitment here?We are very committed to the region. We are fundamentally oriented and not financial engineers. We really look for companies which have a strong earnings profile. We invest at a sensible valuation with a sensible governance in place and I wouldnt mind putting a billion at work in India. We have a global $13 billion fund, so there is no reason why we wouldnt put a billion at work in Mumbai. We have a successful great team. Shweta (Shweta Jalan is the India head for Advent) is a global partner in the partnership.I think we have all the right ingredients: so the team wouldnt stop us, the capital wouldnt stop us and like in any market, we need to find the right opportunities.Deal-making has become very competitive, with almost every major global PE firm having an India presence now. What is your uniqueness?We would do investments from 100 million to $1 billion which is a fairly unusual size. Because typically what you do is that you have a PE fund and you divide it by 20 which is the average size of the deal and you add and subtract a little and that range becomes your sweet spot. We are completely different as we dont care whether its $100 million or a billion in equity or which country it is  we are attracted by the opportunity.Also, what you see in a lot of private equity firms is that the dominating factor is the office. Where the company is headquartered, that office works on it. We are different. So, if you have a healthcare deal here, the healthcare team from London and Boston are in here. If you look at the cement deal, then clearly the building materials team is on board.We are thrilled whenever we find an interesting deal and thats what keeps us going. Also, we set up the investment committees closer to the region. Our structure doesnt have a CEO, no CIO. We are a true partnership that works in consensus. We also have investment committees which are close to the region. So, you dont have to go to NY Investment committee where nobody knows the local fundamentals, governance, the rule of law etc.So, would we see Advent doing more deals in India?Of course. If you look at the size of the funds, we have been fortunate and successful that our funds were bigger than the last funds and were heavily oversubscribed. As the funds grow, we all have to invest more. PE on the whole is a growth industry. When I joined Advent 17 years ago, we were investing out of a billion dollar fund or something like that. We are now $30 billion assets under management and we raised our last fund at $13 billion in six months and couldnt even talk to outside investors much because there was so much demand. Because our firm is growing strongly, we need to do more everywhere. The question is not if, but a question is how much more the teams can do.",2016-10-02,owQCaeyt7xj8nRBbYeGGGI,"Jan Janshen, managing partner at Advent International, says the private equity fund looks for companies which have a strong earnings profile",23:15,Advent wouldnt mind putting $1 billion at work in India: Jan Janshen
149,0.2429,"Bengaluru: Mu Sigma Inc. founder Dhiraj Rajaram has taken charge as chief executive officer (CEO) of the data analytics start-up he calls Indias only profitable unicorn, replacing his former wife Ambiga Subramanian after buying out her stake in the firm.
				   
				Rajaram has also entered into an agreement with Subramanian to buy back her holding in the companya deal that will make him the single largest stakeholder in the company with a 51.6% stake.Rajaram, who made the announcement on Tuesday, did not disclose who funded the deal. He and Subramanian both held a stake of around 25.5% in the company before the deal, he said. The announcement came within months of Rajarams divorce from Subramanian in May.Subramanian, who held multiple roles in Mu Sigma, including director of innovation, head of talent management and chief operating officer, before becoming CEO in February this year, will continue to serve on the board in a non-executive capacity. It was not immediately clear if Subramanian will continue to be associated with the firm once the transaction is completed.Due to personal circumstances, it is time for me to move on from the management team of the company and do something different. All rumours about me starting a competitive firm are untrue, Subramanian said in a statement.Mint first reported on 21 September that Dhiraj Rajaram plans to acquire control of the firm by buying out the 48% owned by his former wife Ambiga Subramanian and private equity firm General Atlantic.There has been some uncertainty over the future ownership and management of Mu Sigma, one of Indias hottest start-ups and earliest unicorns, valued at more than $1 billion, after Rajaram and Subramanian finalized their divorce in May.Founded in 2004 by Rajaram, who previously worked for consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, Mu Sigma raised about $178 million from investors such as General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital, Mastercard Inc., Fidelity Investments and Accel Partners in three rounds since 2011. All the existing backers, including General Atlantic, will stay invested in the firm.There has been a lot of needless and inaccurate speculation around our involvement in Mu Sigma. We are extremely excited about being a partner and shareholder with Dhiraj and his management team and look forward to continuing to help build the company for many years to come, Mark Dzialga, chairman of General Atlantic, said in a statement.The divorce between Subramanian and Rajaram followed the departure in July last year of managing director Ganesh Lakshminarayanan, who had joined the company a year earlier. Mu Sigma had hired Lakshminarayanan, former Dell India president and managing director, in 2014 to lead its Indian operations. Chief financial officer Atul Bansal left the firm in March 2015.This apart, a string of senior executives have quit the firm since April this year, including Goutham Ekollu, head of operations; Anuj Krishna, a nine-year veteran at the company in charge of the companys business on the East Coast of the US; Aditya Kumbakonam, delivery unit lead; Manu Sharma, associate director; Adarsh Kumar, delivery leader; and Sankar Sekar, apprentice leader.It would be incorrect to say there has been no impact (from the separation between Rajaram and Subramanian). But the focus continues to be on the good work we are doing. There is a lot of demand for the narrative that we are offering. We have been one of the last companies to have started in the space. Mu Sigma is not about cost arbitrage. It is about innovation arbitrage, Rajaram said. He declined to comment on the companys valuation and revenue.The firm was valued at $1.5 billion when it raised $45 million in February 2013 in a round led by Mastercard.

154,-0.139625,"Domestic gas prices have been cut again. This is the fourth consecutive cut since November 2014 (see chart). For October-March 2017, prices have declined 18% to $2.5 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) on gross calorific value basis. What is worse is that analysts expect another round of price cut in April 2017 when the next price change is due. So far, trends in regional benchmarks that determine domestic prices indicate another cut is likely.
				   
				So who wins, who loses when domestic gas prices are cut?Earnings of gas producers such as Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) will be adversely impacted. This comes at a time when ONGC and OILs crude oil price realizations are already under pressure due to the lower crude oil price environment. According to Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd, for ONGC, the impact on revenue will be nearly Rs2,500 crore, with a post-tax impact of Rs2 a share (6.5% of its FY18 EPS of Rs31). For OIL, the impact on revenue would be nearly Rs350 crore, and a post-tax impact of Rs4 per share (7.5% of Nomuras FY18 EPS of Rs52). EPS is earnings per share. Very low production from KG-D6 (D6 field in the Krishna-Godavari  basin) means that the impact on Reliance Industries Ltd will be marginal.On the other hand, GAIL (India) Ltd is expected to benefit from low gas prices. The company uses domestic gas for its LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) production. Margins for the LPG business should expand by ~10% with this price reduction, said analysts from Religare Capital Markets in a report on 3 October. After a 20% domestic gas price cut on 1 April, GAILs operating costs fell sharply, 25% quarter-on-quarter in the June quarter for both LPG and gas transmission segments, said Nomura in a report on 30 September. Needless to say, another decline in prices will benefit GAIL further.City gas distributorsIndraprastha Gas Ltd, Mahanagar Gas Ltd and Gujarat Gas Ltdare expected to benefit too. The quantum of benefit, though, will depend on the extent of gain they decide to pass on to consumers in the form of retail price cuts.Meanwhile, the government has also reduced the ceiling price for gas produced from new difficult fields by 20% to $5.3 per mmBtu. This hampers the investment outlook for domestic gas output. With another round of price cuts likely in domestic gas, as mentioned earlier, and the crude oil environment largely muted, the outlook for ONGC and OIL will continue to be challenging.",2016-10-04,L8cE6YaDGUhLBwQdjbKJeM,"With another round of price cuts likely in domestic gas and the crude oil environment largely muted, the outlook for ONGC and OIL will continue to be challenging",00:49,Gas price cut: the gainers and losers

				This was only to be expected, given the increase in revenue expenditure on account of the hike in government salaries.Capital expenditure went down slightly over April-August 2016, compared with the same period a year ago. In sharp contrast, as the chart shows, the governments revenue expenditure went up sharply compared to the year-ago period. The upshot has been a substantial rise in the revenue deficit. The economy, however, has received a substantial boost thanks to the higher deficit.Ratio of forex reserves to external debt hits a high Indias foreign exchange reserves-to-external debt ratio rose to a 3.5-year high of 75.2% by end-June 2016, Religare Institutional Research said in a note to clients. The countrys external debt fell slightly to $479.7 billion in the quarter ended June, on the back of a consistent decline in commercial borrowings. However, according to Religare, since the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) added nearly $80-90 billion to forex reserves over the last three years, Indias external position remains benign versus other emerging market peers.The upshot: India has sufficient forex reserves to weather external shocks.

The US, which consumed 123,114 tonnes of frozen Indian shrimps in fiscal year 2016, remains the largest export market for the seafood from India. In value terms, it is about Rs7,435 crore.

48,0.22565,"Tough negotiations are under way between GAIL (India) Ltd and two bidding groups that applied to charter nine new liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers required by the state-run gas processor and distributor for shipping gas from the US.
				   
				The intense bargaining is over the three LNG tankers that are to be built in India as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modis Make in India programme. The two consortiums comprising mainly Japanese fleet owners with a strong presence in LNG shipping want GAIL or the government to take on potential risks associated with the Indian-built LNG tankers, which would be the first such sophisticated ships built locally. GAIL doesnt want to assume the risks and is waiting for the government to take a position.A consortium of Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd (MOL)-Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha Ltd (NYK Line) and Mitsui and Co. Ltd and another group comprising Mitsubishi Corp.-Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd (K Line)-GasLog Ltd and Foresight Ltd are eyeing the long-term deal because of its sheer sizeworth around $7 billion. Such long-term shipping contracts translate into huge cost savings for GAIL and for the end-use consumers of LNG, a clean source of fuel which India is seeking to rely on to cut carbon emissions.Executives briefed on the tender issued by GAIL for the second time in two years (the first one failed because no one showed up), says there was an attempt by global shipowners to scuttle the bidding process and the Make in India plan by putting conditions that either GAIL or the government may find it difficult to accept.Conversations with these executives, who declined to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media, gives an insight into the role played by local representatives (mostly looking after crewing and other ship agency functions and not well versed with ship construction) of bidding groups in influencing their top bosses in the Tokyo headquarters on the perils of building LNG ships in India and to avoid taking perceived risks associated with this. A GAIL executive summed this up pretty well by saying that the company faced more resistance in pursuing the tender from the local representatives of the bidding groups than from senior executives based in Japan.To illustrate the point, a local representative with one of the bidding groups voiced concern during a meeting on the possible de-hiring of Indian-built LNG ships by GAIL, citing the example of Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd, which a few months ago prematurely cancelled contracts on ships taken on a long-term basis to support its oil exploration activities after daily rentals crashed due to a plunge in crude prices. However, those were small and old vessels which cannot be compared with the sheer scale of the Make in India project, intended to promote local manufacturing.Initially, even GAIL was not willing to get three of the nine LNG ships built in India, but had to change course following a directive from the ministry of petroleum and natural gas.Similarly, fleet owners were extremely reluctant to build these tankers in India due to concerns over construction time line, quality issues and risks associated with running such ships. Again, they had to relent after the government clearly indicated that it was going to use its LNG buying clout to get local yards to enter the highly lucrative LNG shipbuilding business.The LNG cargo purchasing power has been used by other nations such as South Korea and China to promote and augment their local shipping fleet or to build ships locally.Much has happened since the plan was unveiled. Indias state-owned Cochin Shipyard Ltd has managed to get a technology tie-up with South Koreas Samsung Heavy Industries Co. Ltd to build the LNG carriers. It has also secured a licence from French firm GTT to use its patented Mark-III LNG containment systems.It is imperative for both the government/GAIL and the bidders to meet half way to make this a reality. There should be give and takes in such an exercise; thats how plans such as Make in India can work.It would be childish on the part of global fleet owners to assume that Indian-built LNG ships may lack quality and run into operational problems, resulting in financial implications for them.After all, even the Japanese and the South Koreans, who are reputed LNG shipbuilders in the world today, got started at some point. There is always a first time.Having said that, the government and GAIL should not let go of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to start building LNG ships locally for want of a final push in the last lap of the tendering process.There are many upsides to this, one among them being the huge employment it can generate, which is also a political plank of the government.The government needs to guard against those trying to derail the process. The stakes are high for India. It is now or never.P. Manoj looks at trends in the shipping industry.",2016-10-07,6OWdgnJENnnaqIitbGQXpO,The government and GAIL should not let go of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to start building LNG ships locally for want of a final push in the last lap of the tendering process,01:14,LNG shipbuilding: its now or never
387,0.228175,"One look at the rally in the BSE Realty index and one would believe that the sector is doing very well indeed. Since April, it has returned around 30%, outperforming the benchmark BSE Sensex.
				   
				Certainly, the sectors woes have receded, although they are far from over. A June quarter earnings review shows some positive signs. The key is reducing inventory levels, which had soared to 18-24 month levels in some cases in the residential property market. This came about with a slowdown in new launches by developers, mainly in urban property markets.Meanwhile, commercial leasing activity, the bright spot in the sector, has been steadily rising in the past four quarters, supported by an expansion in the services sector.Although residential property sales have picked up in some regions, pan-India traction remains a distant cry. So, while the Mumbai and Bengaluru markets are showing slow sales improvement, the National Capital Region (NCR) is reeling under over-capacity. Firms such as DLF Ltd, with a high exposure to this market, will be weighed down by the burden of unsold projects for some more quarters.This explains why mid-sized firms such as Oberoi Realty Ltd, Godrej Properties and Sobha Ltd, which have a balanced exposure to residential, commercial and hospitality sectors, have weathered the downturn. Whats more, they have fewer legacy projects and less of a debt burden. That said, June quarter sales were not up to expectations across the residential real estate market. So, the recent rally in realty stocks is in response to positive developments on the macroeconomic front. One, the 7th pay commission recommendations of higher salary and pensions for government staff and retirees may trigger demand for mid-segment housing. Two, developers are selling non-core assets and monetizing land parcels to trim debt. Three, the regulatory changes to open the sector to investments is leading to private equity interest in realty projects, which could ease balance sheet pressure for developers.That said, it is safe to await a consistent increase in property sales before rushing in to invest in realty firms.",2016-10-09,sUdmPTYYxAxfaTvpDaeGoM,It is safe to await a consistent increase in property sales before rushing in to invest in realty firms,23:12,Real estate: flashes of recovery in some pockets
161,0.19765,"The June quarter performance of construction firms continued the trend set over the past few quarters. The action is mainly concentrated on construction of roads, given that there has been limited ordering out in other areas of infrastructure such as power and ports.
				   
				Within this universe, mid-sized firms such as NCC Ltd, KNR Constructions Ltd and IRB Infrastructure Developers Ltd continued to fare better. Ashoka Buildcon Ltd, a strong player in roads and in power transmission contracts, disappointed due to slow execution. Otherwise, most firms revenue moved up in high double-digits from a year ago. This was due to a combination of higher construction revenue and toll collectionsa function of higher traffic movement.The June quarter saw fresh order inflows, taking the total order backlog to about 2.5-3 times the net sales of FY16. This implies strong revenue growth at least for the next eight quarters. Meanwhile, the operating margin across firms was in line with brokerage estimates for the June quarter. That is perhaps why the BSE Infra index has risen steadily since April.Of course, there are a few rotten apples in the basket of infra firms. Typically, these are firms that are saddled with stuck legacy projects and, therefore, reel under a huge debt burden and weak operating cash flows. Investors must steer clear of these, although the governments recent proposal to settle disputed projects where there is a hearing in the developers favour, set these stocks on fire. However, it may be many quarters before their balance sheets turn favourable enough to lure investors.For example, the one-time hot favourite on the bourse, IVRCL Ltd, which outperformed street expectations year after year for over a decade, is weighed down by interest costs that are about one-fourth of its net revenue. The June quarter revenue contracted from the year-ago period for some firms with legacy projects due to weak execution.But the quarters robust net profit traction among the mid-sized road construction firms has raised investor hopes for FY17. The reason is that traffic movement and toll revenue will move up on the back of rising traffic movement as the economic recovery gathers speed.",2016-10-09,MEPTJngbMVfqpksj7QQwMJ,Robust net profit traction has raised investor hopes as toll revenue will move up on rising traffic movement when the economic recovery gathers speed,23:12,Infrastructure: its roads all the way
294,0.231175,"Given the rally in commodity prices and the tepid sales growth across auto companies, auto manufacturers put up a decent operating performance for the June quarter.
				   
				On an average, the gross margin, after accounting for only raw material costs, declined. However, most firms contained staff costs and other expenses to sustain operating profitability at year-ago levels. Within the listed universe, Hero MotoCorp Ltd, the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world, posted the highest operating margin in six years. Bajaj Auto Ltd, too, which makes two- and three-wheelers, excelled on profitability in spite of lower exports.Disappointment came from the most unexpected quarters. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the countrys No. 1 carmaker, had a production setback due to a fire at a vendors plants. Lower sales, adverse currency movement and higher commodity prices together culminated in a contraction in operating margin.Likewise, Tata Motors Ltd, contrary to its usual outperformance in the pack, hugely disappointed the Street, as a negative foreign exchange impact and lower sales incentives for its subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover Plc, along with tepid performance by commercial vehicles and cars in the domestic market, dragged consolidated profit down to about one-third the year-ago period.However, investors are hopeful that these currency adversities wont recur. Two-wheelers are likely to gain from rural offtake after a favourable monsoon and from urban demandan offshoot of higher disposable income with consumers after the 7th pay commissions award of salary and pension hikes to government employees and retirees.The resulting sales boost will improve pricing power, enabling auto makers to pass on cost increases. Discounts, too, are likely to be lower than in the past few quarters.These factors will, at least partially, offset the margin pressure on account of rising costs. Only premium product manufacturers such as Royal Enfield, from the Eicher Motors Ltd stable, would buck margin pressure, as the motorcycles are hardly price-sensitive.Meanwhile, within auto firms, two-wheelers and utility vehicles manufacturers may post better margin traction, going by the July and August sales trend. The one segment that may drag earnings momentum in the sector is medium and heavy vehicles. Here, growth is slowing, given the high year-ago base and also since industrial activity has not picked up to the estimated levels.That said, the Street is quick to discount positives in the auto sector. All the auto stocks have returned 25-60% from April till date and trade at near-peak valuation on estimated one-year forward earnings.Investors should watch out for sales growth in the festive season and its sustainability thereafter, which is the key to the next round of upward earnings revision.",2016-10-09,c8toKhBeomPEEly23kdBBL,"Investors should watch out for sales growth in the festive season and its sustainability thereafter, which is the key to the next round of upward earnings revision",23:12,Auto: operating margins hold out in spite of odds
207,0.24055,"Since 1 April, the BSE FMCG Indexs gains have been just shy of the broader markets. That should give some clue of how the June quarter has panned out for makers of FMCGshort for fast-moving consumer goods, or packaged consumer goods. While thats nothing to write home about, nobodys expecting anything dramatic to happen. Morgan Stanley has downgraded the sector, saying it will continue to tail the broader market, according to a 24 September report in The Economic Times.
				   
				In the June quarter, many firms reported urban demand continued to be weak and rural growth continued to slow. Hindustan Unilever Ltds domestic consumer business reported a volume growth of 4%, the same as in the March quarter. Pricing pressure continued to be visible in its soaps business, mainly responsible for pulling down value sales growth. Others did not fare too well either. Dabur India Ltds volume growth was 4% against 7% in the March quarter. If volume growth did not impress, pricing pressures meant sales in value terms, too, was under pressure.However, raw material costs continued to be in their favour, as both food and non-food commodity prices remained low. Also, firms cut back on direct advertising, which led to a lower advertising to sales ratio. Instead, they passed on the cost savings in the form of price cuts or volume discounts, in a bid to drive sales growth and protect market share. Lower input costs and the cut in advertising costs meant most firms saw margins improve although the absolute level of profit growth itself was nothing to get excited about. ITC Ltds results were slightly different. Its volume growth improved, probably because the excise duty hikes in the FY17 budget were relatively moderate. Its consumer products business also did well, with sales rising by 9.5%.There are some silver linings. Monsoon rains have been good, which is expected to have a lag effect on rural demand. Among the events that were eagerly awaited, the hike in central government pay has happened and the goods and services tax will be rolled out in FY18. These are all boosters. The only thing thats missing from the mix is a revival in demand for consumer goods.",2016-10-09,Sb9pnv23k4I3M8K5uGqtUO,"Raw material costs continued to be in their favour, as both food and non-food commodity prices remained low",23:12,Consumer goods: slow growth remains a bugbear

Considering that domestic gas production is not going to improve overnight, the outlook for LNG is bright. Further, it helps that expected global LNG supply is likely to be more than demand, ensuring lower prices for some more time. In that backdrop, Petronet LNG, a company that imports LNG, finds itself in a sweet spot.
				   
				Its share price has surged an impressive 49% so far this fiscal year. Not without reason. For one, the company has brought forward the completion of 5 million tonne per annum (mtpa) capacity expansion at Dahej to October from its earlier guidance of end-2016. That will take the total capacity at Dahej to 15 mtpa.Unlike the Kochi terminal, Dahej has uninterrupted pipeline access and the lowest regas charges, pointed out analysts from IIFL Institutional Equities, adding that weak LNG prices will foster speedier terminal ramp-up. Use-or-Pay contracts and customer advances shield Petronet LNG from volatility in gas prices and demand, said IIFL analysts in a report on 29 September. Under use-or-pay contract, the customer will have to pay even if cargoes are not taken.If demand remains strong, Dahej could have a volume of 14 mt in FY17, said analysts from Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd in a report on 16 September. The brokerage firms current FY17 Dahej volume assumption is 13 mt. Each 1 mt in higher volume results in 9% higher earnings per share, according to Nomura.Petronet LNGs June quarter results were strong. Capacity utilization at its Dahej terminal increased to as much as 130% during the quarter from 111% in the March quarter. The company processed its highest ever volume in the June quarter. The September quarter, too, is expected to be strong.Given the above scenario, it is not surprising that the stock has outperformed the benchmark Sensex and the BSE Oil and Gas index so far this fiscal year. Currently, it trades at 22 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year. Thats not cheap. Moreover, concerns on underutilization of Petronet LNGs Kochi terminal remain, thanks to pipeline connectivity problems. Completion of the pipelines is essential for the improvement in the performance of the Kochi terminal, although thats not expected any time soon.",2016-10-09,wowxpyU2LLtbc4VlYKc0wN,"Considering that domestic gas production is not going to improve overnight, the outlook for liquefied natural gas is bright",23:39,Petronet LNG stock fuelled by better demand outlook

				Voice revenues grew 3.8% and 4.6% year-on-year, respectively, for Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd, and declined by 0.9% for Vodafone India Ltd.But worse still, growth in data revenue decelerated further. As the chart alongside shows, growth in data revenue fell to 35% and 27%, respectively, for Bharti and Idea, from as high as 70-80% just a year ago.In fact, in the June quarter, Idea and Vodafone slowed investments on their networks considerably, which is perhaps an indication that the data opportunity is not as big as was earlier thought.Idea added close to 6,500 3G + 4G sites (in Q1), compared with 17,000 in the previous quarter. Vodafones site additions also slowed to 6,000 3G + 4G sites as compared with 15,000 in Q4. Ideas and Vodafones lower rollout numbers are largely a reflection of the relatively limited spectrum portfolio, especially in 4G. However, it might also be an indication of their view on the market, where both companies have been relatively conservative, compared with Bharti, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities wrote in a note to clients.Ideas voice volumes and revenue grew at a sedate pace as the company attempted to curb promotions. Since the move has backfired, it can be expected to be flexible with pricing to drive growth from Q2 onwards.In any case, industry dynamics have changed considerably since Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd launched operations in September. While data tariffs were anyway expected to be under pressure, Jio has also targeted the voice segment by offering unlimited voice calls at fairly low tariffs.The full impact of the Jio launch on average realizations and the growth metrics of incumbents will be visible only next year; but, its likely that some impact of additional promotions may be visible this year itself, especially in the December quarter.",2016-10-09,iVwWBc2fFY7BUcqAzKzMXP,"Growth in data revenue fell to 35% and 27%, respectively, for Bharti and Idea, from as high as 70-80% just a year ago",23:12,Telecom: slowing data growth a worry for industry

Power Grids net profit grew by an impressive 33% in the June quarter, though capacity additions lagged Street estimates. NTPC clocked strong volumes, while hydro power generator NHPC Ltd saw healthy revenue growth, thanks to incentive income.
				   
				Performances of private power firms Tata Power Co. Ltd and Adani Power Ltd, on the other hand, continued to be affected by one-offs. Adverse orders at its Mumbai business and cost under-recovery at the Mundra plant dented Tata Power profit. Adani Power was hit by low generation and revenue.Reliance Power Ltds revenue fell slightly from a year ago. JSW Energy Ltds numbers were boosted by the acquisition of hydro power assets; otherwise, the firm continues to see pressure on realizations. CESC Ltd reported a steady performance. Revenue rose 12%, helped by better power off-take in Kolkata distribution. But profit remained flat due to high fuel costs.Overall, public sector utilities drove earnings. Private firms are seeing incremental positives, such as CESCs Chandrapur plant tying up a power purchasing agreement (PPA), JSW Energy Ltd getting short listed for a Karnataka PPA and Adani narrowing losses.But the firms are yet to reach a stage where their earnings will begin to see positive momentum. For instance, Adani Power and Tata Powers compensatory tariff issues for their plants are yet to be settled; CESCs Chandrapur plant still has free capacities that need to be tied up and PPA finalization for JSW Energy is awaited. So, despite inexpensive valuations of private firms, analysts continue to prefer state power utilities.NTPC faces demand concerns and Power Grid faces project commissioning worries. But the issues are seen to be transitory and the firms are preferred for steady financial performance. We believe NTPCs PLFs (plant load factors) will be impacted, to an extent, as we enter a seasonally weak quarter for thermal power.

				The Singapore complex gross refining margin (GRM), a measure of the difference between the per-barrel price of crude and the value of products distilled from it, dropped to $5 a barrel in the June quarter, compared with $7.7 a barrel in the March quarter. Still, the reported GRMs of Indian refining firms on a sequential basis fared better. However, these GRMs got a boost on account of inventory gains, thanks to the rising oil price trend over the quarter.Adjusted for refining inventory gains, the GRMs of oil marketing companies (OMCs) were in the range of $4-5 a barrel, according to Spark Capital Advisors (India) Pvt. Ltd. OMCs include Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC). OMCs results beat Street expectations. IOCs operating profit increased by one-third, compared with last years June quarter. HPCLs operating profit rose 17% year-on-year, while BPCLs operating profit increased at a much slower pace of 3%.GRM is a measure of profitability.Reliance Industries Ltds (RIL) reported premium of $6.5 per barrel over Singapore GRM was the highest in the past eight years, according to the firm, and exceeded Street estimates by a good margin. Most analysts expected RILs GRM to be $9.5-10 per barrel. But RILs GRM came in at $11.5 per barrel. The management indicated $2 per barrel can be attributed to gains from inventory, hedging and risk management. RILs stand-alone revenue fell 19%, reflecting the decline in the broader crude oil prices, while net profit rose about 19%. That was because of a 628 basis points jump in operating profit margin, a 3% decline in depreciation cost and an 18.5% rise in other income. A basis point is 0.01%.Meanwhile, oil producers have had it tough what with oil prices languishing.

250,0.2413,"Unlike group firms Adani Enterprises Ltd and Adani Power Ltd, transmission assets owner Adani Transmission Ltd has proved to be a good bet for investors. Despite the volatility, the stock gained 45% in the last one year. Last week it saw another bout of gains after the company said it agreed to buy three transmission line assets from Reliance Infrastructure Ltd, priced at around Rs1,900 crore.
				   
				The agreement comes on the back of two transmission line buys from GMR Energy Ltd for an equity value of around Rs100 crore. The latest acquisition from Reliance Infrastructure has an equity portion of Rs400-500 crore, with the rest Rs1,500 crore being debt that will be transferred to Adani Transmission. Last fiscal year, the company generated an Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of Rs1,863 crore. Roughly half of this was spent on finance costs, leaving the company with a net profit of Rs357 crore. Net cash flows from operations were at Rs1,581 crore.So, given the cash flows, analysts expect Adani Transmission to comfortably close the deal. Further, the transmission revenue for all three assets are collected by a central government-owned utility as a part of a pooling mechanism. This reduces the counter-party risks and helps derive better ratings for its debt instruments, which is important as Adani Transmission is highly dependent on borrowed money.Three global ratings agencies have said that the deal will not affect the companys current rating. With the assets operational and generating revenue, they do not expect the acquisition to weaken the current financial position of Adani Transmission. Fitch estimates that EBITDA contribution from the assets will be sufficient to keep Adani Transmissions financial leverage, as measured by gross debt to EBITDA, at less than 5x in the medium term, Fitch Ratings Singapore Pte Ltd said in a note.What ratings agencies are wary about is the financial leeway for the company. Post the acquisition, Adani Transmission will be left with little financial elbow room, be it for liquidity or for contingencies. While the company itself is in capex mode (building five new lines), it is lapping up assets from the market. We believe the current rating level can accommodate the acquisition although it would leave no headroom for any further material cash outflow, said S&P Global Ratings.Another ratings agency warns that the acquisition is credit negative and leaves little scope for ratings improvement, which could have helped the company refinance or raise funds at even cheaper rates. Further it warned of a downgrade. Adani Transmissions rating could be downgraded if it undertakes aggressive expansion, or if revenues from non-transmission business rise consistently above 25% of total revenues, said Moodys Investors Service Singapore Pte Ltd. On the other hand, the ratings are unlikely to be upgraded in the near term, based on the companys business profile and financial strategy.That said, Adani Transmissions finances are no reason for worry yet.

84,-0.160375,"Singapore/Seoul: Samsung Electronics Co. is corporate royalty in South Korea. Its also a company recognized for its marketing smarts and engineering savvy worldwide, so much so that consulting firm Interbrand ranked it as the worlds seventh most valuable in its 2016 survey, ahead of Amazon and Mercedes-Benz.
				   
				So how is it that the pride of South Korea has so botched the recall of 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 smartphones after complaints of exploding batteries  and a ton of negative publicity by the media in the US, Europe and China, not to mention the vast echo chamber of social media?When it recalled its phones last month, it assured consumers it had diagnosed the problem and that its replacements were safe. Not so it turns out: Customers reported the lithium batteries in new phones went up in flames too, in some instances. On Tuesday, Samsung took the dramatic step of killing off the Note 7 for good.This is a calamity, said Srinivas Reddy, director at the Center for Marketing Excellence at Singapore Management University. The threat for Samsung is how soon they can get back. If they dont get back soon, it provides a vacuum for others to creep in.The company has not said how many new or replacement phones will be affected. Analysts estimated that the original recall would cost between $1 billion and $2 billion, but that figure will now certainly rise.The move sent Samsung shares down 8% on Tuesday, vaporizing $17 billion in market value. Samsungs sterling brand image built up over decades is at risk unless the management team led by vice chairman Jay Y. Lee, 48, doesnt get out in front of the crisis soon.Its a very critical moment for Samsung, said Martin Roll, a brand strategist and author of Asian Brand Strategy. How Samsung is handling this crisis is kind of a way for Samsung to step into the modern era because Asian firms have only started to emerge as very iconic, contemporary consumer brands like Apple. The history of Samsung as a brand is still being written. Also Read: Samsung to kill off Galaxy Note 7 after second round of battery firesSome six weeks after the first reports of exploding phones surfaced, Samsung engineers, as well as US and South Korean government investigators, have yet to discover why lithium batteries in the companys new smartphone product overheat and in some cases explode.The Korean Agency for Technology and Standards (KATS) said in an e-mailed statement on Tuesday, it is investigating the possibility the Note 7 smartphones may have a new defect. An official at the ministry of trade, industry and energy didnt rule out the possibility that the problem may be tied to the overall product design or production. Samsung has said its working with investigators and still trying to identify the source of the battery problem.Whether the Samsung brand takes a lasting hit will depend, in part, on how long the mystery of the Note 7 batteries continues and whether the company is perceived by consumers as stonewalling.Samsung must come clean with a thorough explanation as the previous explanations dont completely add up now, said Mark Newman, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein in Hong Kong.The company needs to find out the exact cause and communicate it clearly to consumers, according to Yoo Jong Woo, an analyst at Korean Investment & Securities Co. I think the company will be able to recover from the blow to its image over time, if the problem does not spread to other phones, he said.Brand strategist Roll agreed that consumers will be forgiving if this is viewed as an aberration at an otherwise reliable company. Consumers need to be kept in the loop here because theyve put trust in Samsungs brand, Roll said. Its a partnership.Until Samsung can come up with some answers, it faces thorny challenges. Six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had originally estimates that Samsung would ship 13 million Note 7s this year. Now it has a hole in its product lineup, just as Apple begins selling its iPhone 7 and high-end devices from Google hit the market.Theres also the risk that the Note 7 troubles spill over to other smartphones in the Galaxy lineup, dampening overall sales momentum against key rivals such as Apple and Huawei Technologies Co. Samsung faces a serious image problem in China, where customers and government-owned media have railed about Samsungs handling of its recall.Theyre done in China, said Shaun Rein, managing director of Shanghai-based China Market Research Group. For the Chinese, they dont differentiate between the Note 7 and all Samsung phones. So theyre not willing to buy any Samsung phones right now.Also Read: What to do with a Galaxy Note 7, now you know it might explodeBack in South Korea, some consumers are more forgiving. Several customers shopping at a smartphone retail store in Seouls Jonggak neighbourhood shrugged off suggestions the latest crisis could hurt Samsungs image. They said they would still consider Samsung phone as an option despite reports of Note 7 catching on fire. One customer said it was a matter of national pride. As a South Korean we should purchase Samsung phones because we should think about the country, said Shin Young-su, 50, who is self-employed. He said he was encouraging more young Koreans to buy Samsung phones to help the company.Another customer who prefers Apples iPhone because of functionality with his other Apple devices said he didnt think the latest crisis would hurt the Samsung brand. The igniting issue is a problem for only few phones, Kim Sung-min, 38, who would only say he works in the service industry. Even if a phone ignites in my hands, I believe Samsung will take care of everything for me. I believe in the brand.Samsung will almost certainly take a meaningful financial hit in the fourth quarter from the Note 7, according to Bernsteins Newman. That said, he estimates the entire Note line only accounts for 8.5% of his 2017 net profit forecast and thinks Tuesdays market reaction was overdone.Dan Baker, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Hong Kong, pegs the direct cost from the initial Note 7 recall at as much as 1 trillion won ($892 million). But the damage to reputation and future sales is probably going to be bigger, he said. Its not just the phone: their whole ecosystem is behind this  displays, memory chips. If their phone sales drop, then their sales of other parts of the business will be impacted. Its a spiral.Baker expects Samsung to try to shift the focus to the next version of the smartphone. Theyre probably going to double the testing on it, he said. They dont want this to happen again.

52,-0.230225,"San Francisco: Facebook Inc. is carrying on its fight with the US Internal Revenue Service over taxes relating to its transfer of global operations to Ireland in 2010 even as the social media giant pledged cooperation with the governments investigation.
				   
				The company is prepared to comply with seven extraordinarily broad summonses demanding information about virtually every aspect of Facebooks core business, but needs more time to do so, it said in a filing Tuesday in San Francisco federal court.The dispute stems from that IRSs claims that Facebooks tax adviser Ernst & Young LLP undervalued the companys property as it was transferred to Facebook Ireland Holdings Ltd by evaluating pieces of the online platform separately. Facebook assigned a base value to the transferred assets in 2010 of $5.8 billion, not including intellectual property, while the IRS estimate is closer to $13.9 billion, according to a filing Tuesday in the Washington-based US Tax Court.Facebook has estimated the value of its future liabilities in the case at $3 billion to $5 billion.Facebook denied that it failed to respond to US summonses involving a tax bill springing from its move of global operations to Ireland in 2010.During the audit, Facebook produced thousands of pages of documents in response to more than 200 IRS requests, voluntarily extended the statute of limitation five times, and made employees available for interviews, the company said in a filing in San Francisco.IRS representatives in Washington and San Diego werent immediately available for comment on Facebooks filings.Bloomberg",2016-10-12,7JPIT2pGhqbpqwgCE1W5OK,"Facebook assigned a base value to the transferred assets in 2010 of $5.8 billion, not including intellectual property, while the IRS estimate is closer to $13.9 billion",10:33,Facebook continues fight over US taxes after Ireland move
239,0.1607,"Delhi and Mumbai are such important markets for Indias top telcos that they have allocated over a third of all their investments in spectrum on these two markets. Not so for Idea Cellular Ltd. Less than 11% of its total outlay for spectrum purchases since 2010 has gone to these markets. 
				   
				And these arent the only markets the company has remained underinvested in after the latest spectrum auction. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities wrote in a note to clients that while Idea Cellulars pan-India ambitions remain, it still has a weak mobile broadband footprint in five large marketsDelhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The company has only a single 3G or 4G carrier in these markets, compared to multiple FDD and TDD carriers acquired by its larger competitors. Lets face itIdea doesnt have a parent that can write a $7 billion cheque. Building strong capacity in these markets is an expensive affair; Idea has to use its resources judiciously and direct them to markets where it has a high share, says an analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage firm. To be sure, Idea Cellulars investments in the remaining 17 circles are even higher than those of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone India Ltd. In the above-mentioned five markets, Idea Cellular has a relatively low market share, which means that its customers in these markets generate low Arpu (average revenue per user) and are unlikely to use 4G services anytime soon. As such, the firms strategy in these markets appears to be to compete largely in the low-end of the market, with some broadband capacity to cater to those who want to upgrade. Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd have acquired significant capacity in these markets, which will result in faster connectivity as well as the ability to handle large volumes of data. High Arpu customers will naturally gravitate to one of these companies. A moot question from Idea Cellulars perspective is if there is a business case at all to continue investing in these markets. Operating in the low-end of the market is a low-margin business, which will get further compressed with the ongoing fall in tariffs after Reliance Jios launch. That Idea sees the possibility of building a business case in these circles at some point is a bold assumption, but gritty bold moves are not new to the company, Kotaks analysts say in their note. Vodafone India , despite the $7 billion cheque from its parent company, decided to stay without either 3G or 4G capacity in five marketsAndhra Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir. These markets account for 19% of the industrys revenues, and about 9.5% of  the companys revenue. So, while both companies have a pan-India presence as far as voice services go, their mobile broadband footprint is either weak or absent in some markets.

314,0.2442,"Bengaluru: Tata Group chairman Cyrus Mistry has a new worry in the growing pile of troubles afflicting Indias largest conglomerate. How to revive growth at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), which accounts for 16% of the groups $103.5 billion revenue?
				   
				The troubles at Tata Motors Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd are well-documented. Despite TCS reporting a 3.7% sequential dollar revenue growth in the April-June period, the company is likely to report weak numbers in the second quarter, results of which will be declared on 13 October.Worryingly for investors, TCS now risks growing at a slower clip this year than last year, when its revenue expanded 7.1%, the slowest annual growth at TCS since 2009, when Natarajan Chandrasekaran took charge as its chief executive. TCS is expected to report an at-best 1.6% sequential dollar growth in the second quarter, according to brokerage BNP Paribas. This, on the back of 3.7% growth in the first quarter, translates into TCS doing $8.79 billion business in the first six months of the current financial year. TCS now needs more than $8.92 billion in revenue in second half of the year if it intends to grow at 7.1% this year. Simply put, TCS will need to record a better show in the October-March period this year than in the second half of last year. This certainly is a tall task as technology outsourcing firms report soft growth in the second half of the financial year.Undoubtedly, Chandrasekaran faces a tough task given the size of TCS.At the heart of TCSs slow growth is its inability to build a stronger consulting practice and reluctance to buy small firms for technologies like design consulting and automation platform providers. These tiny buyouts not just improve the current solution deliveries but also bring in growth. May be now, Mistry could nudge Chandrasekaran to start buying.With this as a backdrop, Mint puts the spotlight on five things to watch in TCSs second quarter earnings on 13 October:1. Revenue growthBrokerage BNP Paribas expects TCSs dollar revenue to rise 1.6% to $4.43 billion in the July-September period on a sequential basis. This is a big worry as this will mean that TCS needs to put forward its best foot forward in the remaining six months of the year if it wants to save itself from the humiliation of recording an even slower growth than last year. Management commentary on demand levels from its customers in Europe, after Britain voted to leave the EU, will be crucial.2. Pressure on profitability poses a double whammySince January this year, TCSs operating margins have been under pressure. TCSs 26.1% Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin at the end of March quarter was 54 basis points less than margins at the end of October-December period last year. The companys margins further contracted to 25.1% at the end of March quarter, which the management claimed to be largely on account of annual wage hikes. Now, as commoditized deals come under further pricing pressure, and TCS continues to spend money in reskilling its workforce and building digital technologies, traditional levers like going slow on hiring, will not be enough to offset the gradual decline in profitability. Analysts say that TCS is unlikely to end the current financial year with its stated guidance of 26-28%.3. What really is the problem among TCSs BFSI clients in the US?On 7 September, TCS in a mid-quarter update, said that some holding back of discretionary spending particularly in the BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance clients) vertical in the United States had led to sequential loss of momentum at the company. Is this just an one-off development or does this suggest a structural malaise? We know all IT vendors are seeing less business from big banks as these banks are spending less in application development work. Homegrown technology vendors are further seeing erosion in current revenue from the embrace of automation platforms, which is cannibalizing the existing model of billing clients on human hours. 4. Rain check of weak sectors and geographiesTCS does not expect growth to rebound in Japan. The company claims to have arrested any loss of business from its UK-based insurance platform Diligenta. Growth from telecoms segment continue to be wobbly. Together, an underperformance from the three units eroded about 2% growth from the companys 11.9% growth on constant currency basis in 2015-16. TCS needs to report some growth on a consistent basis if it has to better last years growth.5. Is higher net erosion of existing business biting into TCSs growth?During the July-September period last year, TCS claimed its order book was the strongest ever, with about 30% more than the company ever managed in any quarter. The company, however, does not disclose its order book size. Outsourcing deals are long-term contracts, and IT vendors can generate only about 3-4% of revenue from new orders in the first year, according to JPMorgan Chases George. Agreed, IT firms lose about 3-5% of current business every year, which in TCSs case, translates into a loss of about $500-825 million a year. This clearly suggest that TCS is losing more business from existing clients because even some business generated from its record order book has not offset the annual loss of business, thereby resulting in a sluggish y-o-y growth.",2016-10-12,hesaBaeP0eIEHrwSnqJO5K,TC is likely to report weak numbers in the second quarter and risks growing at a slower clip this year than last year,01:16,TCS Q2 earnings: Five things to watch for today

Nilekanis observation comes at a time the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is preparing to launch an upgraded version of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), called UPI 2.0, by early next year. Nilekani, who serves as an honorary adviser to NPCI on innovation and public policy and was one of the key brains behind UPI, said that once some of the teething issues with the current version of UPI are sorted out, the system will be ready to take off in a big way, especially in e-commerce. In an interview, he spoke about how UPI was created in the first place, the role played by the likes of NPCI and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its development, and whats next for UPI. Edited excerpts:
How was UPI conceptualized in the first place and how did you go about building it?The foundation of UPI is really the highly successful IMPS (Immediate Payment Service) that NPCI launched five-six years agoaround 2011. This was a remarkable innovation because for the first time it gave you 24x7 instant credit. For example, in a very short period of time, in less than five years, the volume on IMPS has gone to Rs24,000 crore a month and it has become the de facto way of doing remittances in India. Thats the great success story that NPCI created and is really the first product to do instant credit. But it couldnt be used for merchant payments because for that you need instant debit Then some of us got together and were discussing that with the rise of smartphones, there was a need to build on the success of IMPS and to build something which was world-class, could do both credit and debit, smartphone-to-smartphone, etc. Then NPCI appointed me as an honorary adviser on innovation and public policy so that I could share my inputs and entered into an MoU (memorandum of understanding) with iSpirt (software product industry lobby group)... This all happened in late 2014. Then in February 2015, we had the launch of UPI by (RBI) governor (Raghuram) Rajan, who was always a big supporter of the idea. It took them a year to get the software built by RS Software, etc. So it was basically built as a layer on top of IMPS with debit. And then all these great innovations came, like virtual payment address (VPA), push-and-pull payments, etc.all that was the work of the iSpirt and NPCI teams... It took us more than a year to get it done. Then the actual launch happened in April 2016. Then another two-three months to test out everything and get all the banks going. And finally they went live about a month ago.What were some of the triggers behind the creation of UPI?We felt we were in a unique position because there was an organization like NPCI which was a very strong organization on payments, set up by the banks and owned collectively by the banks. And this organization had come into being coincidentally around the same time as UIDAIboth came up in 2009. There has been a very close working relationship between UIDAI and NPCI, which led to the creation of Aadhaar payment bridge, etc. Since it was a bank-owned utility, it was well-geared to offer an interoperable system. RBI was supportive, not just the governor but also the department of payments.How is UPI different from other payment systems in countries like the US and China?In the US and China, its like a walled garden where a couple of key players control the system. For example, in China you have the likes of WeChat and AliPay. With UPI, anyone can build on top of it and innovateits open and inclusive. Its almost like being on a highway without any toll gates.Whats your assessment of where UPI is at right now? What are some of the things that still need to be fixed?This is a mammoth task taking a countrys payments system and make it go into the completely 21st century online real time...across smartphones, fully secure, encrypted, virtual payment addresses, etc. This is a major thingthere are bound to be teething issues. There are some teething issues in onboarding customers and so on, but I think its all par for the course. Itll take a couple of months to settle that down. But as more banks like SBI (State Bank of India) and HDFC (Bank) come online, more and more of Indias banking terms will be on UPI. And then once all these teething issues are sorted out, Im very confident itll take off because it is such a superior value proposition. Both for online and offline merchant payments and both for online B2B (business to business) payments.Whats next for UPI? What should we expect in the next 6-12 months?The idea is that in the next couple of months all the technical issues, all the onboarding issues, all the user interface issues would have been shaken outany concerns that people have. All the banks will be live. All the major merchants should be live. There will be a few hundred thousand customers who will be ready to transact with their VPAs and apps. And there will be choice for consumers to select very attractive apps from a number of banks. Once you have that, you have the ground conditions for take-off. My sense is that the first take-off will happen in the online, e-commerce world. And then the same thing will migrate to the offline world...The big thing to remember is that in the typical card world, you went from offline to online. In the UPI world, were going from online to offline.",2016-10-12,zV5lj7FoBJ2s1KM8orBEKJ,"UIDAIs former boss Nandan Nilekani on the origins of Unified Payments Interface, NPCI and RBIs role in its development, and whats next for UPI",03:32,UPI is almost like being on a highway without toll gates: Nandan Nilekani
104,0.2474,"When Dell Inc. said it would acquire EMC Corp. for $67 billion last October, analysts were sceptical since both companies primarily sold commoditised products like personal computers (PCs), servers and storage in a world where clients had begun demanding solutions aimed at digital transformation.
				   
				On Wednesday, Alok Ohrie, president and MD, India Commercial of Dell EMC, insisted that the combined company, christened Dell Technologies, is now uniquely positioned to provide customers with solutions that will secure their digital future with a single window of engagement. The combination creates a $74 billion company with a technology portfolio which  includes virtualization company VMware, security firms RSA Systems and SecureWorks, software and services (including cloud and big data analytics) firm Pivotal, and cloud management software company Virtustream.In an interview, Ohrie said he believes there are three pillars of digital transformation: IT infrastructure transformation, workforce transformation and security transformation. Effectively, we now play in all the elements of a modern data centre, he said.Dell doesnt break up country-wise revenue, but according to estimates by Dataquest, a Cyber Media (India) Ltd Publication, Dell Indias revenue stood at Rs17,480 crore in FY 2015-16. It pegged EMC Indias revenue in 2014-15 at Rs2,452 crore (combined about Rs20,000 crore, or $3 billion).Tom Sweet, chief financial officer, Dell Technologies, recently said that the combined revenue of the two companies in India was closer to $2.5 billion.According to International Data Corp. (IDC), in the overall PC shipment for the April-June quarter of 2016, HP Inc. reclaimed its top spot with 28.4% market share, while Dell captured the second spot with 22.2% backed by focused efforts on growing branded consumer desktop category.In the India x86 (Intel-based servers) market, HP maintained its lead position in the October-December quarter of 2015 with 36% market share in terms of unit shipment, followed by Dell with a market share of 24% and Lenovo with 12%. EMC led in Indias external storage industry with a 28.4% market share in the January quarter.Nevertheless, the fact is that the shift to cloud is transforming and cannibalizing hardware markets, and technology companies, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), Oracle Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc.,  need to evolve their strategies in order to survive, according to Forrester analysts.Ohrie pointed out that Dell Technologies, with 140,000 employees, annual revenue of $74 billion and over 20,000 patents and patent applications, has over the last few years made significant investments in R&D that will stand it in good stead.Dell and EMC have made a cumulative R&D investment of $12.7 billion over the last three years and we have publicly stated that for this year, $4.5 billion of investment will be made in R&D, which is multiple times what the competition is investing, Ohrie said. Going forward, Ohrie said, we are going to focus on the digital transformation space and help our customers take that journey at a faster pace.But what will happen to jobs made redundant by the Dell-EMC merger? On 7 October, Dell Technologies confirmed there would be layoffs following their acquisition of EMC.Ohrie countered, Nothing that I know of.

215,0.24915,"New Delhi: Director general of hydrocarbons Atanu Chakraborty is presiding over the transition to a new regulatory regime for Indias hydrocarbon pursuits aimed at wooing investors with liberal terms when the global oil and gas industry is sailing through a painful phase of low prices. 
				   
				In an interview, Chakraborty said steps will be taken to reduce disputes in the sector and to make the terms for producing unconventional and difficult to extract fuels as investor-friendly as possible. Edited excerpts:Will India be able to cut import dependence on oil and gas by 10% as planned, considering cooking gas consumption and its import is rising?The Ujjwala programme (of distributing LPG without upfront payment to the poor) is part of a shift towards using cleaner fuel and improvement in the quality of life, which is bound to happen. The demand for fuel on account of this has been captured in the consumption growth of fossil fuels. We have to produce that much extra over and above what can be produced on a business as usual scenario. We are looking at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 5.6%. Year on year growth has been almost 11% in 2014-15. The planned 10% reduction in import dependence by 2022 is called for to make us reasonably strategically secure. To achieve that, we need to increase acreage (under exploration and production). We have launched the auction of the discovered small fields this year, after a gap of about six years. In the last two years, fuel price volatility was a reason not to go ahead with the offer of blocks. The blocks currently on offer are relatively small and have many hydrocarbon discoveries so that investors do not have to spend a lot on exploration. There are other incentives too (such as pricing and marketing freedom and duty free import of equipment). The idea is to incentivize investments and to add to overall production. Having more players in the market will increase competition and efficiency in the industry.With global energy firms now cutting back on their investments, the auction of small discovered fields is going to be a test of their appetite for further investments, isnt it?Under the new hydrocarbon exploration licensing policy (HELP), pricing and marketing freedom is given to gas produced from deep-water, high pressure and high temperature areas. Also, the new royalty structure favours investors. Under the revenue share regime, which replaces profit sharing prescribed in the earlier licensing policy, governments share remains the same (as a percentage of revenue), which gives investors the comfort and incentive to produce more and benefit more in absolute terms. With stable policies, robust economic growth and improvement of our ranking in ease of doing business, the country risk for energy firms is very low. We have to leverage it to get investments and then hold their hands to ensure that they get access to market quickly. We have also ensured that they get the processing facilities of ONGC and Oil India Ltd on a commercial basis. There is no gas utilization policy, the entire market for gas is open to producers. People do talk about other incentives in the case of shale gas. Perhaps we will again revisit the regime to see what more can be offered for production of tight oil and shale gas. We need to tap all these resources simultaneously. Increasing productivity and acreage under exploration and getting to difficult reservoirs is broadly the contours of the strategy. Auction of the small discovered field is the first step. The response to the roadshows has been tremendous. As we learn from the process, if we need to tweak our offering, we certainly will do it in a transparent way. Nothing is cast in stone.What is the strategy on unconventional fuels like gas hydrates and shale gas?In the east coast, we are working together with Japan and the US Geological Survey to extract gas from gas hydrates. It is still at a research stage and we have to reach a stage where the molecules are stable. While tight oil and shale gas are within the realm of possibility, gas hydrate has to reach a stage when we can think of commercial production. Considering our reliance on import, we need to be there on all these emerging areas from day one so that we can monetize any upside at the earliest. The gas market in India is rapidly developing with new transmission lines coming up, including for city gas distribution and for fertilizer plants. The share of gas in the national hydrocarbon basket is expected to go up from about 7% now to 25% in some years. In the case of Gujarat, it is already 25%.What are the tax breaks available for gas producers?Income-tax exemption no longer exists for gas, but import of equipment enjoys customs duty exemption.Price volatility in a highly capital intensive and risky sector such as energy, could in no time bankrupt a successful company. Disputes in such a scenario is normal as we have seen in the past. How do you plan to address this?There would be differences in perception, and hence disputes, in big contracts such as those for natural resources. We have to continuously fine tune the resolution mechanisms. We have made many corrections in the production sharing regime and we keep improving the existing system. If the contractor wants to produce hydrocarbons, the government will always help them. Those who are well intentioned, will always do well. We have a large number of fields which have in the last 20 years added to our energy basket. As a regulator, we want every energy company to bring investments and produce more. We will be taking many steps to further improve regulations.What are the specific areas you would be working on to reduce disputes?Communicating right at the time of auctioning the fields, the different aspects of executing the contract and the issues where perceptions could differ between parties, can eliminate avoidable disputes. We keep examining the models elsewhere that could help in reducing the time required for dispute resolution. For example, invoking force majeure provisions in a contract is one area around which many disputes take place. Creating awareness about this among investors is important. A lot of education is required on contract management by the parties. In the road shows for the discovered small fields, we tried to educate businesses about these aspects. We are also thinking of having a portal to facilitate communication among stakeholders that will help in reducing disputes.",2016-10-13,TbkBDUN0P9dE8WGxSKoC0N,"Steps will be taken to reduce disputes in the energy sector, says director general of hydrocarbons Atanu Chakraborty ",01:41,The entire gas market is open to producers: Atanu Chakraborty
238,0.2489,"The fact that IndusInd Bank shares have easily beaten the sector indices in terms of gains over the last six weeks should not be a surprise anymore. The private sector lenders results for the September quarter showed enough improvement to cheer investors, starting with a net profit growth of 26% to Rs704.25 crore and an all-time high net interest margin of 4%.
				   
				Since 1 September, its shares have risen 3.19% while banking indices fell by 2%. Clearly, the run-up to its results release has been in anticipation of stellar numbers.What makes IndusInd Bank such an attraction for investors?Besides an improvement in its net interest margin for the eighth straight quarter, the bank reported a loan growth of 26% and said the growth emerges primarily from its high-yielding retail portfolio. This, along with an improving low-cost current account and savings proportion of deposits, has added 12 basis points to the margins during the quarter. A basis point is 0.01%.The 22-year-old lenders net interest income clocked a growth of 33% to Rs1,460.31 crore while non-interest income grew by 24% to Rs1,094.28 crore.An efficient lender is often rewarded, especially in the banking sector awash with inefficiency in both lending and cost management. IndusInd Bank continued to maintain the health of its loan book with asset quality metrics largely unchanged. Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) as a percentage of total loans stood at 0.91% at the end of the September quarter, little changed from the previous quarter. But gross NPAs rose 4.4% sequentially to Rs899 crore at the end of September because of one account, said the management.A diversified loan book, growing low cost deposits and a steady asset quality puts IndusInd Bank in a sweet spot. But at a price-to-book value of 4.2 times earnings of FY16, is it too hot to handle? Analysts have recommended a buy rating even at these valuations.Here is a thread of caution. The lender was expecting relief from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on its exposure to Food Corporation of India. RBI had mandated all banks to make 15% provisioning against this exposure. This shows up in the 35% jump in the provisions of IndusInd Bank. And, despite a diversified book, the lender still relies on a robust performance of the commercial vehicles market.",2016-10-13,VsZfk6SyiiWs3KSAW02egI,"IndusInd Banks results for the September quarter showed enough improvement to cheer investors, starting with a net profit growth of 26% to Rs704.25 crore",01:46,IndusInd Banks bull run continues

144,0.249575,"Mumbai: When Dilip Shanghvi wants something, he has a track record of getting it. 
				   
				One executive, Srinivas Lanka, recalls the founder of Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd calling more than 100 times over three years with a job offer two decades ago. Shanghvi was setting off on an acquisition-fueled strategy to transform his small generic drugmaker into an industry powerhouse, and he wouldnt take no for an answer.In the end, Shanghvi won over Lanka, who agreed to leave his job at global pharma giant Novartis AG and sign on as the executive director in charge of Suns Indian business in 1996, staying until 1999. A lot of entrepreneurs used to call me, but not many had this kind of fire in their belly, said Lanka. I thought this guy has some different blood in him.That kind of relentless drive has helped make Sun Indias biggest drugmaker and best performing stock over the last 20 yearsand Shanghvi the countrys second richest person, with an estimated net worth of $15 billion. Yet now, with Suns shares on track for their worst annual decline since 2008, Shanghvi, 61, has seen his deal-making mystique called into question as Sun faces an array of challenges at home and abroad.Shanghvis largest ever deal, the purchase of Indian rival Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd in 2015, has been bogged down by a slowdown in emerging markets and bans by US regulators at acquired factories that threaten his record as a turnaround artist. Meanwhile, the political uproar over drug prices in the US means additions to Suns portfolio there that have driven revenue and the share price look increasingly unsustainable.After 15 years where sales grew at a compound annual rate of about 30%, Sun this year has forecast growth would slow to between 8 and 10%, according to company statements. The shares have tumbled more than 7% this year.Nothing is visible at the moment which will provide positive upside, said Ranjit Kapadia, an analyst covering the stock at Centrum Broking Pvt. Ltd. Theres nothing on the plate.Shanghvi declined to be interviewed for this story.Theres no denying that Shanghvi, who graduated with a degree in commerce from the University of Calcutta, has had a terrific run since launching Sun in 1983. Early on, the company differentiated itself from the crowd of Indian makers of generic drugs with a focus on high-margin psychiatric drugs, then branched into medicines targeting chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease, now more common in prospering India.They focused on chronic diseases much before everybody else did, said Nilesh Gupta, managing director of Lupin Ltd., Indias second biggest drug company by market capitalization. Thats how they got completely entrenched in the market. A chronic prescription is a lifetime prescription, an acute one is a ten day one.All the while theres been a steady stream of acquisitions, alternately bolstering the firms growth or catapulting it to the next level. Since 2001, there have been more than 20 deals worth $5.6 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Always a voracious consumer of industry intelligence, when it came to acquisitions Shanghvi would mobilize the whole firm to do due diligence and look for troubled targets that could be bought at a discount, said Shyamal Ghosh, a former Sun executive director who retired in 2011. Finding weaknesses of the acquired companies was very easy for him, he said.Both Shanghvis eye for value and his tenaciousness were exemplified in the 2010 takeover of Israel-based Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. It took a three-year legal battle to force Taros former chairman to abide by the terms of a previously terminated takeover agreement requiring him to sell his controlling stake to Sun, but soon after taking Taro in hand Sun had ferreted out a way to squeeze out more profit: steady price increases on Taros portfolio of medicines.Since taking control those price hikes have amounted to a 300 percent increase across Taros portfolio, according to data provider IMS Health. The move lit a fire under Taros profit margin, which reached nearly 60 percent last year, according to Bloomberg data.With each year profit margins grew at Taro, Suns shares climbed, setting the stage for its biggest ever acquisition, the $4.1 billion purchase of Ranbaxy. With the success of Taro as a precedent investors celebrated the closing of the Ranbaxy deal in 2015, sending Suns shares to a record.Since then, Sun has led a less charmed life. Shanghvi now faces an array of challenges, starting with a share price which has tumbled about 35% since its peak in April 2015, wiping out more than $12 billion in shareholder value.The exposure to emerging markets Sun bought with Ranbaxy has proven ill-timed as a collapse in commodity prices abruptly sent nations like Brazil, Russia and Venezuela into recession. Their plunging currencies translated into an immediate hit to the 13% of revenue Sun now gets from emerging markets outside India.Worse has been the hit to Suns US revenues, 50% of the total, from sanctions by regulators in that country. With the Ranbaxy deal, Shanghvi bought four plants saddled with export bans from the US Food and Drug Administration because of deficient manufacturing practices. But just as he was getting started turning them around one of Suns own key facilities received a warning letter of its own from the US FDA. Though less severe than the outright bans faced by the acquired factories the warning letter prevented the launch of new US products from the plant and hampered production there, slowing revenue growth in Suns core business as it added regulatory costs on top of those he bought with Ranbaxy.Drug pricesWhats more, the US political backlash over high drug prices that has drawn scrutiny to the business practices at drugmakers like Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. and Mylan NV adds a political risk to price hikes at Taro, which combined with increased competition is starting to make the strategy look unsustainable. Last month, Taro said it had received a subpoena from the US department of justice asking about pricing for its products and communications with competitors. Taro didnt respond to a request for comment.What the street is waiting for is for other businesses to sort of take over from Taro, said Nitin Agarwal, an analyst at IDFC Securities Ltd who follows the company. To an extent thats not happened and the stock had been soft the last year and a half.Sun has requested the US Food and Drug Administration reinspect its facility under a warning letter and cannot say when that will occur, Freddy Castro, a company spokesman said in an e-mailed statement. The company is also planning to submit one of the four Ranbaxy facilities for re-inspection this year, he said, declining to comment on Taro.The Ranbaxy transaction is living up to expectations and is on track to realize the expected $300 million of synergies by year three, he said.Looking aheadNevertheless 61% of analysts covering Sun, including Agarwal, have the equivalent of a buy rating on the company, according to a survey conducted by Bloomberg. Most point out that while it may have been the acquisitions that catapulted Sun to the number one spot it was years of steady growth, fueled by Shanghvis ability to spot the next big treatment area, that got him within striking distance.With the market for the simple generic medicines he built his business on getting saturated, Shanghvi has already begun steering his company into more complex ones that promise higher margins, like dermatological creams, injectable medicines and highly regulated pain killers. Next up is building a portfolio of completely novel medicines, some of them developed in house. All that means increased spending on research and development -- for a bigger, though less certain, payday.Of course theres always acquisitions. But with Sun still waiting on the full benefits of Ranbaxy, Shanghvi has said hes not on the lookout for big deals at the moment, even as theyve avoided totally shutting the door should an opportunity arise.Nevertheless, Suns stock remains becalmed as Shanghvi continues searching for a lever that can return his companys growth to the form its had most of the last 20 years. Those whove worked with him closest in that time say, in true Shanghvi fashion, he wont rest until he finds it.He has an insatiable hunger to grow bigger and bigger, former executive director Ghosh said. Hes extremely focused. Hes not interested in anything else except the pharmaceutical business. Bloomberg",2016-10-13,JO3Q4ROOkEeIKlvt25ZpcO,Dilip Shanghvi s deal-making mystique is called into question as Sun Pharmaceuticals faces an array of challenges at home and abroad,09:41,"Dilip Shanghvi, M&A artist behind Indias best stock, now faces his greatest test"
83,0.2444,"Seoul: Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd said Friday that the discontinuation of the Galaxy Note 7 would cost the company about $3 billion during the current and next quarters, bringing the total cost of the recall to at least $5.3 billion.
				   
				The Note 7 discontinuation will cost in the mid-2 trillion won range during the October-December period and another 1 trillion won ($884 million) during the January-March quarter, the company said in a statement.Samsung already slashed its third-quarter profit forecast by $2.6 billion earlier this week, an amount that could wipe out its entire mobile business profit. That did not include the cost of Samsungs first recall, which analysts estimated at 1 trillion won to 2 trillion won.Samsung has enough cash and other businesses to absorb the shock from the phone recall. It said it expected to generate 5.2 trillion won ($4.6 billion) in operating income during the third quarter after the recall cost. Analysts said most of the income will be generated by sales of advanced displays and semiconductors.Samsung added that it will make significant changes in its quality assurance processes to enhance product safety for consumers. It did not elaborate.The company said it will expand sales of two other smartphones released in spring, the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge, quashing rumors that it may try to release updated versions of those devices. Samsung usually releases a new iteration of the Galaxy S series in spring, so the company may have to provide a strong incentive to sell the 6-month-old phones, such as lowering their prices.Due to unexplained fires and overheating problems, more than 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 smartphones were recalled before the product was discontinued earlier this week just two months after its launch in August.In the United States, 1.9 million Note 7 phones are subject to the two recalls. Samsung also recalled about 200,000 phones in China and about half a million phones in South Korea.The US Consumer Product Safety Commission said there were 96 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the country, including 23 new reports since the first recall announcement last month. The company received 13 reports of burns and 47 reports of property damages associated with the phones.Consumers should immediately stop using and power down all Galaxy Note 7 devices, including Note 7 devices received as replacements in the previous recall, the agency said.The botched recall raised questions about Samsungs initial analysis of the Note 7 phones problems. At first, Samsung said a minor manufacturing error in the batteries for the Note 7 was causing the phones to overheat.The problem with the replacements is still unclear. Experts say Samsung may have rushed to conclude the Note 7s problem was a battery issue and it may take a long time to find the real cause.Seeking to retain customers, Samsung is giving an incentive of a $100 credit to Note 7 owners who switch to another Samsung phone.The Note 7 device was one of the most expensive smartphones in the market with all the latest technologies from Samsung, including the ability to unlock the phone by scanning a users iris.

				Infosys cut its full-year dollar revenue forecast for the second time this fiscal, and now expects to grow between 8.2 and 9.2%, and 8-9% in constant currency terms.The sharp cut in FY17 USD revenue growth guidance, despite the recovery in growth momentum in 2QFY17, reflects a shift to a conservative approach on guidance after two successive cuts on the aggressive stance adopted at FY17-start, Pankaj Kapoor, director of India IT services and software equity research at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, wrote in a note. Chief executive officer Vishal Sikka said Infosys was scaling back its growth target because it had performed poorly in the first quarter and on account of near-term uncertainties.Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., which has most of its employees in India, has also cut its revenue growth forecast twice and expects to grow at 8.5-9.5% in 2016. Cognizant follows the calendar year. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Indias largest software services firm, does not give forecasts, but after it reported a poor 0.3% sequential dollar revenue growth on Thursday, it will be a tall task for the company to better the growth rate of 7.1% reported last fiscal year.Worryingly for both Infosys and TCS, it is not just sluggish revenue growth which is of concern. Both firms sounded less confident of maintaining profitability, with Infosys conceding that operating margin may be below its stated range of 25-26%.Infosyss sharp downward revision from the first growth outlook of between 11.8% and 13.8% dollar revenue expansion in April means that Infosys has shaved off $440 million in business from its first projection of adding $1.31 billion in incremental revenue this year. For Infosys, an at-best 9.2% growth means it expects to do $870 million in new business this year compared to $790 million last year.Infosys Ltd shares ended the day 2.53% lower at Rs1,025.70 on NSE even as the Nifty index rose 0.12% to 8,583.40 points.ALSO READ | Is Infosys being overly conservative with its guidance?Infosys said on Friday that revenue for the three months ended 30 September improved 3.5% to $2.58 billion from $2.5 billion in the preceding quarter. This was on account of the company partially recording $20 million in business from the Goods Services and Tax Network project, and a 4.5% growth in business from clients in banking and financial services segment.In constant currency terms, revenue grew 3.9% sequentially. Net profit rose 5.5% to $539 million from $511 million in the April-June period as the company deployed fewer people at expensive overseas client sites. A Bloomberg survey of analysts expected Infosys to report revenue of $2.58 billion and profit of $529.81 million in the September quarter.Operating margin expanded 80 basis points to 24.9% at the end of the September quarter, compared with 24.1% at the end of June. There are a couple of heartening takeaways in Infosyss performance during the second quarter, say analysts. First, a 4.6% sequential increase in business from banking clients suggests that Infosys may be winning customers at the expense of other large technology vendors.Second, Infosys reported over $1.2 billion in large deal wins during this quarter. This means that in little less than 18 months, Infosys has managed to increase its large deal wins from a little over $400 million a quarter to $1.2 billion.Analysts at Citibank said in a note after Infosys declared its earnings that fairly all-round growth in key geographies and verticalsbetter than what peer TCS reported is another positive for the company. The US business, which brings 61.5% of Infosyss revenue, improved 2.6% sequentially, while business from India, which accounts for 3.4% of overall revenue, jumped 29.1%.The company added 78 new clients in the second quarter, taking the total number of customers to 1,136.

67,0.2478,"Tokyo: It turns out Masayoshi Son isnt ready to retire after all.
				   
				Just a year ago, SoftBank Group Corp.s founder looked poised to fulfil his long-stated plan of stepping aside in his 60s. He had a global telecom empire, track record of spectacularly successful investments and a bright young successor. Instead, the 59-year-old edged aside his heir apparent, cut the biggest deal of his career yet and revealed on Friday his ambition to become one of the worlds most powerful investors.SoftBank said it is forming a new fund to put as much as $100 billion in the global technology industry in the next five years, partnering with Saudi Arabias public investment fund to find companies that will become influential in the future. By comparison, all the venture capital funds in the world disbursed a record $129.5 billion in funding in 2015, according to CB Insights.The man who once proclaimed his goal of creating the worlds most valuable company isnt hiding his ambition: Over the next decade, he aims to be the biggest investor in technology.In other words, Japans second-richest man isnt going anywhere. Son in 2014 brought in Nikesh Arora, luring the former Google executive with a pay package that rivaled those of Apple Inc.s Tim Cook and Walt Disney Co.s Bob Iger. He spent two years grooming him as a successor only to change his mind in June. A month later SoftBank announced plans for a $32 billion takeover of chip designer ARM Holdings Plc, Sons biggest bet to date and a wager on the future of interconnected devices.For some time, it seemed like Son has fatigued, considering retirement and bringing in Arora. It is pretty clear now that he is still full of zeal, said Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive officer of Myojo Asset Management Co.It is not yet clear who will call the shots at what is tentatively named SoftBank Vision Fund and the Japanese company declined to comment further, noting the fund had not yet closed. SoftBank named Rajeev Misra, its head of strategic finance, to lead the project.Son has made tens of billions in returns from investments in companies including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, Yahoo and Supercell Oy, and the new fund will likely pursue a similar strategy of backing technology companies at all stages. While Arora was SoftBanks president, the company had plans to put about $3 billion into startups each year.During his two year tenure, Arora spearheaded investments in Indian e-commerce provider Snapdeal.com, ride-hailing service Ola Cabs, real-estate website Housing.com and hotel-booking app Oyo Rooms. In October 2015, SoftBank led a $1 billion fund-raising round for US-based online lender Social Finance Inc.Over the next decade, the SoftBank Vision Fund will be the biggest investor in the technology sector, Son, chairman and chief executive officer of SoftBank, said in a statement Friday. We will further accelerate the information revolution by contributing to its development.The Saudi government will consider putting money into the fund and become the lead investment partner, SoftBank said in the statement. The Tokyo-based company, which will invest as much as $25 billion, signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with the Saudis, who may put in as much as $45 billion over the next five years. Other large global investors may participate to increase the pool to $100 billion.Also Read: SoftBank tech fund to invest up to $100 billion with Saudi ArabiaSoftBank said that the fund will be reflected on its consolidated financial statements, without giving further details. Its shares rose as much as 3.7% in Tokyo. The stock had gained 5.8% this year before today, compared with a 12% decline in the benchmark Nikkei 225 index.The company is stepping up investment activity even though it has more than $100 billion in debt. SoftBank has relied on borrowing and earnings from its domestic telecom operations to pay for investments in start-ups in India, US and China while balancing losses at its US subsidiary Sprint Corp. By tapping outside investors, Son will be able to cut more ambitious deals than he could on his own.Also Read: SoftBanks robot Pepper gets to work at Taiwan bankARM acquisition has brought Son to a limit of how much he can invest just with SoftBanks balance sheet, Myojos Kikuchi said.The companys high-speed Internet and wireless services in Japan generated 1.16 trillion yen ($11.2 billion) of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the fiscal year ended 31 March. SoftBank has 3.5 trillion yen of bonds maturing in the next five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Its conceivable that after capturing the core of the Internet of Things with ARM, Son will next look to other semiconductors, electronic components and software, said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute in Tokyo. SoftBank has a proven track record of investment successes.

281,0.2455,"Earnings of refiners for the September quarter are likely to decline compared to the June quarter. Indian refining firms had benefited from substantial inventory gains in the June quarter, but that advantage will not be available for the September quarter, as there may not be a major inventory impact considering oil prices have not moved dramatically.
				   
				Whats more, refining margins have inched up only a bit. Benchmark Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) last quarter came in at $5.1 a barrel against $5 a barrel in the June quarter. In short, even though refining margins have risen a bit, lack of substantial inventory gains will mean that reported GRMs of Indian refining firms are likely to be sequentially lower.State-run refining and marketing companiesBharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd are no exception to that trend. On an overall basis, subdued refining performance will more than offset the benefit of robust market margins (calculated diesel retail margins up 32% QoQ) and healthy marketing volumes, wrote Edelweiss Securities Ltd analysts in their September quarter preview. Five brokerage firms previews studied by Mint show  that Ebitda of all three companies is expected to fall against the June quarter. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. But investors are sitting on good gains so far this year. In general, improving profitability, robust product demand and lower crude oil price environment have helped sentiment for these stocks.On the other hand, earnings of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) are expected to be reasonably resilient, Arya Sen and Ranjeet Jaiswal of Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd wrote in a report on 10 October. The brokerage firm estimates RILs stand-alone net profit to increase by 11% year-on-year and only 4% quarter-on-quarter decline, helped by strong refinery throughput and higher petrochemical earnings. Its GRM is expected to be close to $10 a barrel compared to $11.5 a barrel in the June quarter. Updates on its expansion projects and telecom business will be crucial for the stock. The RIL stock has gone up about 8% from its recent low on 2 September following the announcement of the forthcoming commercial launch of services by its telecom unit, at its annual general meeting.Meanwhile, the story continues to be grim for oil producersOil and Natural Gas Corp.

				While this does not indicate the central banks propensity or willingness to intervene in the market, the unwinding of RBIs forward position has brought down premiums. The one-year forward premium, or the extra that companies are willing to pay to either sell or buy dollars at a future date, is 5.42%, down more than 80 basis points over the last seven months. RBI took huge positions in the forward market to hedge the outflows of foreign currency non-resident (FCNR) deposits that have begun to mature now.Global oil demand growth continues to be weakGlobal oil demand growth continues to be dawdling. It dropped from a five-year high of 2.5 million barrels per day (m b/d) in the September 2015 quarter to a four-year low of 0.8 m b/d in the September 2016 quarter, accor-ding to International Energy Agencys (IEAs) latest oil market report. Thats on account of vanishing OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) growth and a marked deceleration in China. However, the December quarter is expected to be better. After unusually mild winter weather in much of the northern hemisphere in 4Q15, year on year growth should rebound somewhat in 4Q16 (+1.4 mb/d), said IEA.

Four out of eight sectors showed better growth than last year. In fact, growth rates in sectors such as refinery products, steel, cement and electricityall leading indicators of economic recoverywere at a faster pace than in the previous fiscal year. Refinery products signal higher consumption of crude oil-linked products such as diesel and petrol. This is ratified by higher auto sales.

				The company was granted a formal licence on 14 October. BP granted licence to market Motor Spirit (petrol) and High Speed Diesel (diesel)another milestone for BP in India, the company tweeted. The UK-based firm, as also Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd, was given approval by the oil ministry to retail petrol and diesel, officials said. A significant step in #BPs partnership with Indiabeen granted licence to market Motor Spirit and High Speed Diesel, it said. A BP India spokesperson had earlier this month stated that: BP sees a strong future for transportation fuels in India. We are keen to be involved in this market and contribute to its development. The company had in January this year won in-principle approval to retail aviation turbine fuel (ATF) to airlines in India. Subsequently, it got full approval for that. We can confirm we have been granted approval for marketing for ATF, the BP spokesperson said. For a licence to retail auto fuelspetrol, diesel and ATF, a company should have invested a minimum of Rs2,000 crore in exploration or production of oil and gas, oil refining, gas or product pipeline or terminals leading to additionally to the existing assets or creation of new assets in the eligible activities. BP, which had in 2011 bought 30% interest in 21 exploration blocks of Reliance Industries for $7.2 billion, had cited investment of nearly $500 million in oil and gas exploration and production for gaining the licence. India currently has about 56,190 petrol pumps, with public sector firms operating a majority of them. Private sector operators are limited to Essar Oil and Reliance Industries, who between them have some 3,500 petrol pumps. Royal Dutch Shell operates 82 petrol stations.

373,0.202325,"Oil majors including Statoil, Shell and Chevron are experimenting with various technologies, from drones and drill design to data management, to drive down costs and weather a deep downturn. 
				   
				Crude prices have more than halved since mid-2014, forcing companies to cut billions of dollars in costs. Determined to shield dividends and preserve the infrastructure that will allow them to compete and grow if the market recovers, they are increasingly looking to smarter tech and design to make savings. French oil and gas major Total said it was now using drones to carry out detailed inspections on some of its oil fields following a trial at one of its Elgin/Franklin platforms in the North Sea. Cyberhawk, the drone company that led the trial, said this kind of work was previously carried out by engineers who suspended themselves from ropes at dizzying heights. It said the manned inspection used to take seven separate two-week trips with a 12-man team that had to be flown in and accommodated on site.The drones do the work in two days and at about a tenth of the cost, according to the UK-based firms founder Malcolm Connolly, who said it had also worked with ExxonMobil, Shell, ConocoPhillips and BP. Total declined to comment on how long the manned or drone inspections took, or specify how much money was saved.Statoils giant Johan Sverdrup field, the largest North Sea oil find in three decades, is a leading industry case study for cutting costs in the era of cheap oil.The firm has cut development costs for the first stage of the project by a fifth compared with estimates in early 2015, to 99 billion crowns ($12.2 billion). The savings have largely been made by focusing on the most efficient technology and designs from the beginning, Statoils technology head Margareth Oevrum, told Reuters in an interview. Executives say the growing attention on technologies that have been around for some time shows how wasteful the global industry had been in the years before the downturn.For example, simply finding a more efficient route for the oil pipeline that would carry the crude from the Sverdrup field to the onshore refinery cut 1 billion crowns, Statoil said. It has also developed a drilling template that is acting as a guide for the first eight wells to be drilled at the field. It said it had reduced the overall drilling time by more than 50 days, saving about 150 million crowns per production well.Global upstream oil and gas spending has fallen by more than $300 billion across the industry in 2015-16, according to the International Energy Agency. Around two-thirds comes from cost cuts, it said. Alex Brooks, oil and gas equity analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said tech innovation in the industry was about 100 tiny things, adding: The bottom line is you end up with a much lower cost.Another way firms are looking to cut costs is by using their vast amounts of data to better predict their needs. Since the price slump, firms such as Shell, ExxonMobil and Statoil have started using software to better manage their data to cut wastage in the ordering of construction materials. Gunnar Presthus, Nordic energy lead at consultancy Accenture, who advises oil majors and national oil firms, said the downturn had led to the industry waking up to the potential of the data they store. The oil industry, to some extent, is one of the most digitalized industries, he said. Companies are now able to use this wealth of data to make changes that will save money.",2016-10-17,pK4u37UCcXUpnNABQ8lkvL,"Crude prices have more than halved since mid-2014, forcing oil companies to cut billions of dollars in costs and look at smarter tech and design",01:50,Oil giants explore new technologies to cut costs
223,0.2415,"Mumbai/Ahmedabad: The Rs86,000 crore ($13 billion) of cash the Essar Group will get from selling a 98% stake in its oil unit and other assets will not only help it reduce operating company term debt by half, but will also wipe out a substantial part of the holding companys debt, making it the largest debt reduction exercise by an Indian business.
				   
				Even as bank investors cheered, the transaction with a group led by Russias Rosneft PJSC points to the fact that the Indian banking system still has to depend on sale of assets by debtors to achieve true resolution of soured loans.The operating company debt, which includes (that of) Essar Oil, Vadinar Port and Vadinar Power, where the total debt is about $5 billion, will become part of this transaction. This would be a shade over 50% of the operating companys term debt. In addition to this, another $5 billion debt of holding company will also be deleveraged, said Prashant Ruia, director, Essar Group. He didnt reveal the total debt of the group, which brokerages such as Kotak Institutional Equities estimate at Rs1.3 trillion. The deal value of $13 billion is the enterprise value of the assets being sold. The remaining proceeds from the deal will be used to restructure the debt of Essar Steel, settle some of the working capital debt and some will go to the promoters, said Ruia.While we are yet to sit down and discuss this in detail with the Essar Group promoters, the expectation is that some parts will come to the steel company too, a senior official at a large state-owned bank said on condition of anonymity.According to Ruia, the promoters are open to investing further equity in the groups steel company if the restructuring proposal requires them to do so. Prospects at Essar Steel are looking up. We are functioning at about 70% capacity. The project is already completed. We will reach close to full capacity in two quarters, said Ruia. Whatever were the problems of the past, (they) have now been overcome. Essar Steel will soon become the crown jewel of the group, just like Essar Oil was.Most lenders in Essar Steel have classified the Rs40,000-crore account as a non-performing asset, with some such as ICICI Bank Ltd, HDFC Bank Ltd, Federal Bank and Axis Bank Ltd selling either part or all of their exposure to Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Co. Ltd.I will not talk of company-specific future-looking statements, but I would say that possibilities of resolution only increase as the industry does better and as promoters are able to bring in part of their equity, ICICI Bank managing director and CEO Chanda Kochhar told CNBC-TV18.ALSO SEE | Why has Rosneft paid a packet for Essar Oil?ICICI Bank shares gained the most, 6.91%, among Essar lenders as investors cheered news that part of the funds from the oil deal would be used to clear pending bank liabilities.

283,0.2499,"Steve Hasker, global president and chief operating officer at Nielsen Holding plc, was in India to meet clients and speak on the growing importance of mobile in advertising at the Mobile Marketing Association conference in Gurgaon. 
				   
				During the trip, he met executives from PepsiCo, Nestle, Reckitt Benckiser, Tata group, BARC India and Facebook, among others.India is a very important market for us. The visit was to ensure our success continues and we stay connected with clients, Hasker said as he explained the importance of Nielsens newly launched Total Audience Measurement tool in the US. Edited excerpts:What does Total Audience Measurement include?Total Audience Measurement, thats been launched in the US, has the ability to measure any piece of video, audio or text, on any device at any time and to do it seamlessly and consistently. It has an advertising measurement component and a content measurement component and the ability to put them together. It obviously has a TV, PC, connected device and tablet, and smartphone component and in the US, we have rolled out all those pieces.Here in India, we have started with the digital ad ratings. So, we started with the advertising component. In the coming months, we look to launch the content ratings. But Total Audience Measurement is more than just digital?What Total Audience Measurement does is, it takes all the digital touch points and combines with TV advertising. So, for any campaign, an agency will say, okay, I should think about TV relative to these digital touch points. Should I buy more TV or less TV? This is very important because different markets have different objectives in terms of reach and frequency. Right now, Total Audience Measurement is available in the US; but we have also launched in Mexico and a version of it in Brazil.When will you introduce it in India?To a large extent, that is dependent on BARC (Broadcast Audience Research Council). They have the TV data. In theory, we could do it today because BARC data and digital ad ratings are consistent; but it requires an advertiser to put those two together.Is linear TV declining?What we have seen in a number of countries is the pressure on TV ratings. The size and frequency of audiences watching television has come under pressure in some of the more developed markets like the US, UK and Australia. And that has meant growth in terms of time spent on digital devices. However, what marketers are trying and have now started to understand is that TV has a reasonably unique value proposition in terms of the ability to tell a story to consumers in a way that is accepted by them. And that many large brand campaigns need a TV component. So, the ability to come out of TV altogether and going to digital was overstated. Particularly in 2016 in many markets, we have seen a reversion back to TV and more reliance on TV from an advertising perspective. But the UK and US numbers suggest digital ad revenue has surpassed TV numbers.In the UK, digital surpassed TV a number of years ago; and in the US, it has surpassed in the past 18 months. Those numbers are for real. But this year, in what we call the upfronts which is the mechanism of buying and selling advertising on TV in US, we have seen some reversion back to TV. What a number of major advertisers found that they probably swung the pendulum too far toward digital; and in doing so, they saw some decrease in reach of their campaigns to their target audience. Was losing Indias TV market to BARC a big setback for Nielsen?We certainly enjoyed being part of the TAM joint venture (between Nielsen and Kantar Media owned by WPP Plc) for quite a long period of time. We are very supportive of BARC. We met BARC and have a good relationship. Wed like to help them if we can. So we are looking forward. We think therell be an opportunity to do that. Which are the successful digital models globally? What we have seen in the last couple of years in the US and many countries is the emergence of truly spectacular digital models. One of course is Google with its search model thats been extended to YouTube. And the second is Facebook. In fact, Google, Facebook and, increasingly, Snapchat are proving to be very successful digital models partly because they have attracted disproportionate amounts of consumer time and attention and partly because they have an economic model which is very efficient. Facebook announced last week it had 4 million advertisers. And one of the great things about Facebook and Google platforms is that for an advertiser, they are extremely easy to use. You can target a particular audience and you can buy using your credit card So for advertisers and agencies, it is a great model. It is also a highly profitable model.What about newspaper publishers?It is more difficult for traditional publishersnewspapers or magazines or what we call pure play digital content websites and portals because the audiences access their content through Google, Facebook and Snapchat. In other words, the means in which they get content is through one of these larger players and, secondly, the time and attention is smaller on their properties.So, whats their future?In an increasingly fragmented and complicated world, great journalism, great video production, great TV production is not easier to do. So, even though we have got this great democratization of information and it is freely available in many different places, the ability to interpret news and write insightful commentary around the news, does not become easier in that environment. So, the value attached to that goes up not down.Whats happened here is that theres been a significant disruption in the distribution mechanism; so, whether it is a newspaper or a TV channel , or magazine, consumers now have many different ways to get to that content but, ultimately, the content itself has to be incredibly valuable. And now, done properly, there are more ways to monetize great journalism than there were previously. Right now, what media formats is venture capital (VC) chasing?VCs are very good at sniffing out areas of growth. So they are focused on a couple of thingsone is video. That is, players who are in the digital video space, either producing or distributing video content. Secondly, they are focused on players who have interesting data setson consumer identity or consumer behaviourpurchase behaviour or media consumption behaviour. The other place VCs are more focused on is fintechlike mobile payments and also on healthcare related apps and start-ups.Nielsen acquired Indicus Analytics in India. Are you eyeing more firms here?We would like to make more, provided they enhance our business and make sense financially. For us, India is a very important market. What is the next big thing for Nielsen?The big area of focus for us will be the connected system. We have two businesses. One measures media behaviour, the other measures consumption of consumer packaged goods and provides all kinds of analytics around that. In the media business, the big investment is Total Audience Measurement, and, as we said, we have rolled that out in many countries and we are in the process of bringing that to India. The second area is to build the connected system which links the market share data to explanatory analytics. Say, for instance, did the market share of Kinley water go up because of better product innovation like a new bottle size, different packaging or concept, or did it go up because its marketing has been more effectivetheres been more money on digital and more money on TV. Or did it go up because of in-store execution, its pricing, promotion and assortment was better.

362,0.240775,"A $13 billion deal involving Russia in India threatens to weaken the grip of Middle East crude suppliers in the worlds fastest growing oil market.
				   
				Rosneft PJSC is part of a group of investors that beat suitors from Saudi Arabia and Iran to buy Essar Oil Ltds Vadinar refinery, Indias second-biggest, in a deal announced over the weekend. Russias largest oil producer is following a strategy by resource-rich firms and nations to secure outlets for their output, and may supply the facility with Venezuela crude and challenge Middle East exporters that provide about two-thirds of the countrys imports.India will be the most important product-growth market over the next 25 years, making it important to Russia, according to Neil Beveridge, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.With the Essar deal, Rosneft is targeting a market of 1.3 billion people that imports more than 80% of its crude requirements and which is forecast by the International Energy Agency to be the worlds fastest-growing oil consuming nation through 2040. The country has emerged as a bright spot for global demand as the quickest economic expansion among major economies spurs increased use of trucks, cars and motorbikes.Market accessThe transaction also includes about 2,700 Essar Oil retail stations, a market that has attracted top oil companies such Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc. Most of Essars output is sold domestically, either through its own outlets or to government-owned fuel retailers.The access to the Indian market attracted Rosneft the most, Prashant Ruia, chairman of Essar Oil, said in an interview in Mumbai on Sunday. It is one of the worlds largest markets. They wanted to have a piece of the market.Also read: Engineers India, Gazprom to prepare India-Russia gas pipeline blueprintRosneft also sees the potential to expand in the Asia-Pacific region by supplying fuels to Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Australia, it said in a statement.The deal will enable Russia to have greater influence over the Asian market, said Abhishek Kumar, an analyst at InterfaxEnergys Global Gas Analytics in London. This would be in response to Saudi Arabias attempts to penetrate the European market, which is dominated by Russian oil.Venezuelan crudeThe need for oil-rich nations to invest in overseas refineries to secure market share has intensified amid a global glut. Saudi Arabia is buying stakes in refiners through its state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco in countries from Indonesia to the US. Kuwait is also investing in processing facilities.Essar Oils Vadinar refinery in Gujarat can process about 400,000 barrels a day. It was designed to run on low-quality crudes from Venezuelan or the Middle East, rather than Russian grades. Venezuela made up almost half the refinerys supplies in the first six months of the year, followed by Iran, according to shipping data obtained by Bloomberg.The best way for Rosneft to supply crude to Essar is via its equity in Venezuela, said Tushar Tarun Bansal, director at Ivy Global Energy, an industry consultant in Singapore. Bringing this crude to India helps Rosneft and Russia the most by securing their equity crude supply and not adversely impacting its own market in Europe.By comparison, Middle East exporters led by Iraq and Saudi Arabia provided more than 65% of Indias overall crude imports during the April-June quarter, according to oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan.Strategic dealsRosneft and Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the state oil company, agreed earlier this year to terms on swapping crude oil and fuels. The Russian oil giant also has interests in five projects in VenezuelaPetromonagas, Petrovictoria, Petromiranda, Boqueron and Petroperijathat contain estimated oil reserves that exceed 20.5 billion tonnes (about 150 billion barrels), the company said in February.India has been deepening its energy ties with Russia, which has also developed nuclear reactors in the South Asian nation and has discussed increasing supplies of natural gas through both LNG and pipelines. Indian state-owned companies have so far spent almost $6 billion for new stakes in Russian oil assets in Siberia.After letting India companies invest in Russian exploration and production projects, India is reciprocating by allowing Russian oil major Rosneft to invest in refining in India, said Bernsteins Beveridge. These agreements are very strategic, aimed at boosting Indias energy security and boosting Russias access to the most important long term growth market. Bloomberg",2016-10-17,oMDuiVNGQqQXrS5QCOYSKM,"With the Essar Oil deal, Rosneft is targeting the Indian market which is forecast to be the worlds fastest-growing oil consuming nation through 2040",12:27,Rosnefts Essar Oil deal takes Russias turf war to Middle East backyard
204,-0.24805,"New Delhi: In a setback to Cairn India, the Delhi high court on Tuesday rejected its plea seeking permission to export surplus crude from Barmer oil fields in Rajasthan.
				   
				Under a production sharing contract (PSC) between Cairn India, a Vedanta group company, and state explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC), it could sell surplus crude oil only to government and its nominees.The terms of the PSC allowed Cairn get 70% of crude from the well while the state-owned company would get 30%. The plea is bereft of merits, stands dismissed, said Justice Manmohan who pronounced the order.He added that company could resort to dispute resolution mechanism under the PSC to address the issue of export of surplus crude.The oil and gas exploration company through the hearings had maintained that it should be allowed to export its surplus crude as private domestic refineries in India were not offering competitive prices with respect to the international market.It said that they were agreeable to offering the domestic players in the country the first option to buy the crude, but at international prices.Due to neither the government, nor its nominees or public sector refineries willing to purchase its crude, Cairn contended that it was forced to sell to two private refineriesReliance and Essar, at a loss since these prices were not internationally competitive.The Centre had reiterated that the countrys no-export policy on crude as long as the country does not attain self sufficiency could not be changed.Additional Solicitor General, Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre told the court crude oil per se was not allowed to be exported. He said that India had a total refining capacity of 223 million tonnes. However, at present only 38 million tonnes of crude oil was available. It would not be in the interest of the country to export crude, he argued.Cairn India, however, argued that the countrys foreign trade policy did not bar export of crude.",2016-10-18,S3WuY3SsNVQ7NJkpCXiXvN,Delhi HC cites a production sharing contract between Cairn India and ONGC to bar the Vedanta group firm from exporting surplus crude to any third party,11:36,Cairn India cannot export surplus crude from Barmer oilfields: Delhi HC
62,0.23405,"Bengaluru: The appointment of D.N. Prahlad, a relative of founder N.R. Narayana Murthy and a former employee of Infosys Ltd, as an independent director on the companys board hasnt gone down well with at least one proxy advisory firm.  
				   
				Prahlads appointment last week seems to suggest that the founder-promoters, none of whom are on the board, finally have their man on it. Prahlad certainly seems to be a nominee of the founders, said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of proxy advisory and corporate governance firm InGovern Research Services. It is clear that by having Prahlad on the board, the founders want access to the board and ability to influence decisions.Prahlads Bengaluru-based firm, Surya Software Systems Pvt. Ltd, also does some business with Infosys.Infosys maintains that work done by Surya with Finacle, Infosyss core banking platform, is not large and Prahlads appointment is in compliance with the relevant definition under the Companies Act. That could well be the case. The Board receives several inputs from various quarters, and takes decisions solely in the best interest of the Company. These include CEO compensation and inductees to the Board, said a spokeswoman for Infosys. Murthy did not respond to queries on the appointment.Subramanian said his firm will surely question Infosyss decision to appoint Prahlad when the company seeks shareholder approval.An Infosys executive who spoke on condition of anonymity claimed the appointment of Prahlad was yet another indication of Murthys continued influence at Infosys. The worrying thing of this appointment of an executive perceived to be close to the founder is what message it sends to the senior leaders at the company, said the Infosys executive. If the board agrees to have a representative of the founder, then leaders clearly are told who is more important. So, can the CEO really have his team rally around him?Current chief executive officer (CEO) Vishal Sikka is Infosys first non-founder CEO. To be sure, Infosys has categorically denied the existence of twin power centres at the company. First, there is no such twin power centres. That is completely wrong, and that will be very unfair to the promoters, R. Seshasayee, non-executive chairman of Infosys, said in an interview last month. Because, like I mentioned, Murthy has been an exceptional leader who has chosen to stay away and only give advice when sought from. So it will be utterly wrong (to claim otherwise).Seshasayees response came against the background of several reports, including in Mint, that said the promoters were unhappy with the high compensation offered to Sikka, the appointment of Punita Kumar-Sinha as an independent director, the high severance package initially offered to former chief financial officer Rajiv Bansal and its subsequent termination. Seshasayee clarified in the interview that the severance agreement would be administrated in line with the rights of the parties.Infosyss board has Sikka and chief operating officer U.B. Pravin Rao as executive members and eight independent directors. Other than Seshasayee and Prahlad, the other independent directors are Kumar-Sinha, Ravi Venkatesan, John Etchemendy, Jeffrey Lehman, Roopa Kudva and Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw.Sikka became the firms first non-founder CEO in August 2014. Murthy and two other founders, S.D.

91,0.2461,"The Essar Group may have been in a debt trap, but there are no signs of distress in the Essar Oil Ltd sale to PJSC Rosneft Oil Co and a consortium led by commodities trader Trafigura and private investment group United Capital Partners. Essar said it has sold a 98% stake in the oil company at an enterprise valuation (EV) of $10.9 billion or Rs72,800 crore.
				   
				This works out to around 12.5 times Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization). Most analysts value Reliance Industries Ltds refining business at an EV/Ebitda multiple of around seven times at best. Prima facie, Essar has got itself a good deal.Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients, The formal announcement of the deal at the recent BRICS summit in the presence of the political leaders of India and Russia suggests a high degree of involvement of the Indian government in the transaction. We note that Indian PSU oil companies had earlier purchased a 49.9% stake in the Vankor oil block of Rosneft.Besides, according to a Bloomberg report, Essar was in talks with as many as five overseas oil companies for the asset sale. Its natural that Rosneft and the consortium ended up paying a premium when the competition was as high.That aside, the Essar asset offers decent growth opportunities. The company has had plans to double capacity at the existing plant, but couldnt do so because of financial constraints. The buyers should be able to follow through on these expansion plans and drive growth. Besides, Essar Oils refinery is in close proximity to the deep draft Vadinar port, which lends greater efficiency to the operations. The port has been acquired in a separate transaction at a valuation of $2 billion. Essar Oil also operates a network of 2,700 retail outlets. They may not have added much to overall profits until now, but their prospects have improved because of increased deregulation of prices of petroleum products.Rosneft can drive synergies by shipping relatively cheap crude oil from Venezuela and the Trafigura connect will help in selling oil products to Asia-Pacific markets.Essar Oil currently processes around 145 million barrels of crude oil annually. According to an oil industry analyst who did not want to be identified, its safe to assume that the company makes an Ebitda of around $6 per barrel, resulting in an annual Ebitda of $870 million. While this results in an expensive valuation of 12.5 times for the refining asset, this must be seen in light of other growth prospects, the added advantage of the port facility and the retail outlets, he adds. What about implications of the deal for Indian companies?The Essar Groups total debt in the system is estimated to be about Rs1.3 trillion, and this is expected to reduce substantially after the deal. While the group will use the proceeds to pay off debt, bank debt will also reduce, as part of Essar Oils debt is being refinanced by a Russian lender, according to news reports.ALSO SEE | Rosneft-Essar Oil deal cuts Essar Groups debt, lifts banksICICI Bank Ltd, one of the largest lenders to the Essar Group, has already seen a nearly $1.5 billion rise in market capitalization after the deal announcement. According to Kotaks analysts, The deal is a significant event for the Indian banking sector for several reasons...

369,0.0161,"According to balance of payments data released by the central bank, gross inflows from computer services stood at $18.24 billion in the April-June quarter this year. 
				   
				Whats striking about the data is that this represents a year-on-year growth of just 0.3%, suggesting growth in inflows from IT have practically dried up. As the chart alongside shows, growth has come off substantially compared to pre-crisis levels, when growth rates averaged over 30%.But it must be noted that the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBIs) data shows FY16 gross inflows from computer services of around $74 billion, while Nasscom puts the industrys revenues at $108 billion in the year till March 2016. Besides, while Nasscom estimated FY16 growth at 10.3% in dollar terms, RBI data puts growth in inflows at merely 1.4%. Growth in gross inflows, of course, need not be the same as growth in IT sector export revenues.Having said that, its true that growth rates of IT exports have come down substantially, as is evidenced in the September quarter results of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd. Indias IT industry is set to grow in single digits this fiscal year, its weakest performance since the global financial crisis. Based on TCS and Infosyss comments, growth is likely to be in the 7-8% range. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a recent note to clients, At present, Indian IT Industry faces three broad headwinds: (1) weak IT spends in financial services and healthcare verticals coupled with rise in insourcing or expansion of captives by select financial services clients, (2) deflationary impact of automation on revenue. Automation savings built in large deals/renewals puts downward pressure on revenues; downward pressure on contract values has been an ongoing pattern but has accelerated in the past 12-18 months, and (3) lack of adequate participation in digital.

304,0.247275,"New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modis government is planning a Rs.21,000 crore package of state aid for Indias solar panel manufacturing industry, according to two officials.
				   
				The so-called Prayas initiative, short for Pradhan Mantri Yojana for Augmenting Solar Manufacturing, a central-government plan designed to lift Indias installed photovoltaic capacity as well as to create an export industry, according to two senior government officials with direct knowledge of the plan. They asked not to be identified because the policy isnt yet public.Modi wants to raise renewable capacity to 175 gigawatt by 2022 from 45 gigawatts at present. In addition to meeting its own energy targets, which Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates may cost $200 billion, India wants to emulate industrial developments in neighbouring China, where solar manufacturers have created a world-leading export industry.The Prayas programme, part of Modis Make in India campaign, is intended to create 5 gigawatts of photovoltaic manufacturing capacity from 2019 and build 20 gigawatts of projects in the country by 2026, according to the officials. The policy, which is being developed by the ministry in charge of renewable energy and industrial policy, along with the Niti Aayog government research group, will be presented to the finance ministry within a month before going to the cabinet for final approval, they said.Catching ChinaLast month power minister Piyush Goyal said in Mumbai that a policy to encourage domestic manufacturing of solar equipment is in works. When reached on phone, the spokesman for the power and renewable energy ministries declined to comment.India has become one of the biggest clients of Chinese photovoltaic manufacturers and in the absence of its own domestic capacity, that reliance could potentially grow. In the first six months of 2016, India imported 18% of Chinas production worth $1.1 billion, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.Indias policy proposal, expected to create thousands of jobs, is also in response to the industrys demand for help to the countrys solar manufacturers, one official said, adding that multiple tenders of a few hundred megawatts each would be issued for the manufacture of everything from wafers to modules.Price advantage?The government could offer about Rs.90 lakh a megawatt for manufacturing tenders and Rs.50 lakh a megawatt for local deployment, according to one of the officials, who said the numbers are subject to change.The plan might give a price advantage if the manufacturing-hub logistics are well planned, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst Jenny Chase. Money alone isnt a sufficient incentive for companies to set up the most high-tech automated factories needed to compete, she said.Japans SoftBank Group Corp. told Bloomberg News last month its considering a manufacturing joint venture in India that could produce the solar panels needed to meet Modis energy targets.To build large-scale manufacturing efficiency matching Chinese economics of scale will require government support, Manoj Kohli, executive chairman of SB Energy said in an interview in New Delhi.

34,0.24715,"Mumbai/New Delhi: Infrastructure conglomerate GMR Group has initiated discussions with SembCorp Industries Ltd of Singapore and US-based Lone Star Funds for selling a significant stake in GMR Chhattisgarh Energy Ltd (GCEL), a 100% subsidiary of GMR Energy Ltd (GEL), three people familiar with the matter said. The move is part of the groups efforts to bring down its  debt that stood at Rs43,400 crore at the end of September.
				   
				GCEL has two power plants with combined capacity of 1370 MW at Raipur, Chhattisgarh,  that commenced commercial operations in March.While SembCorp has been in talks with GMR for a while now, the discussion with Lone Star Funds is a new development and is exploratory in nature, said one of the three peoplea senior GMR Group executive who did not want to identified.The second person, a banker, said SembCorp is keen to pick up stake in the project. He added that the absence of long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) is a hurdle. These make the transaction viable given significant cost over-runs in the project.Currently, GCEL has only short-term PPAs. It is hoping to sign long-term PPAs with state-owned utilities in Uttar Pradesh and Telangana. It has already bid for such agreements in the case of the former.According to its most recent filings, GCEL has an overall debt of Rs8,290 crore and needs to start paying back money from March 2017. The three people said its enterprise value (EV) is close to Rs12,500 crore and includes two captive coal mines valued at Rs750 crore.During the normal course of business, We talk to various parties for different transactions. we would not like to comment on any specific transaction, said a GMR Infra spokesperson. Analysts say that GCEL will have to sign PPAs in the range of Rs3.80 per unit to make the project  viable. A slightly lower tariff could be sustainable but only if banks agree on a moratorium and a possible restructuring.We are talking to banks; everyone understands that the current situation helps no one, said the GMR executive. India is one of SembCorps key markets and an integral part of the companys emerging markets strategy. Were constantly on the lookout for suitable opportunities to grow our business in India especially in the areas of thermal power, renewable power, water treatment and urban development. However, we do not comment on  specific opportunities, a SembCorp spokesperson said. A spokesperson for Lone Star Funds declined comment. The GMR Group, which has interests in airports, energy, transportation and urban infrastructure, is monetizing assets to repay creditors after years of debt-driven expansion.In May, it sold a 30% stake in some of GMR Energy Ltds assets for $300 million (around Rs2,000 crore) to Malaysias largest electricity utility Tenaga Nasional Bhd.  In July, it sold 74% stake in Maru Transmission Services Ltd and 49% in Aravali Transmission Services Ltd to Adani Transmission Ltd for Rs 100 crore.Both SembCorp and Lone Star Funds were among the shortlisted bidders for SunEdisons India assets which were acquired by Hyderabad-based Greenko Energy for $392 million.The Singapore-based SembCorp Green Infra, a subsidiary of SembCorp Industries, has over 900 MW of wind and solar power assets in operation and under-development in southern, western and central India.Last year, it acquired a controlling stake in Green Infra from IDFC Alternatives for Rs1,060 crore, marking its entry into Indias renewable energy market. According to credit rating agency Crisil, Indias power generation capacity has grown at a compound average growth rate (CAGR) of 10% since 2009. Of this, the private sector contributed the mostclose to 60% of the coal-based capacityand invested Rs3.2 trillion.Despite the growth in capacity, the demand for power from distribution utilities (power discoms) has grown barely at 0.4% during this period.

232,0.249625,"One of the authors of this article built a speech recognition engine in the early 1990s. It was built on a special purpose digital signal processor, in a lab that was especially dedicated to this project. The engine required two days of training, could recognize a single voice and had a vocabulary of close to 50 words. It was close to state-of-the-art at that time. 
Cut to the present. All smartphones today have the ability to recognize speech. No special hardware is needed. Training needs are minimalthe technology works straight out of the box and can be trained to recognize anybodys voice. And the vocabulary is infinite. The phenomenon that enabled this rapid change is the advancement in processing power, storage and communication. Computing speed is doubling every year, as per Moores law, which predicted an exponential growth in the number of transistors in integrated circuits within processors. Similar stories of transformation can be told about storage and communication. Todays technology road maps have gone beyond the classical Moores law with the advent of distributed computing, rapid development of smart devices packed with sensors and the Internet of things.While we have seen a lot of technology transformations over the last 20 years, what is even more fascinating is the expectation that the next two decades will see technology innovations being rolled out at a faster pace than ever before. Technological change will continue to be exponential. Noted inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil argues that there is even an exponential growth in the rate of exponential growth! What this means is that in the 21st century, we wont see a 100 years of technological progress. We will see 20,000 years of progress at todays rate.FIVE BIG TECHNOLOGY THEMES FOR THE FUTUREWhile there are many technological advancements taking place all around us, we think five big themes will play a very important role in defining the next 20 years.Gene is the new Byte: In the grand scheme of things, we are all very similar. In fact, 99.9% of our genes are identical. Its the last 0.1% that makes all the difference! In April 2003, the human genome was completely mapped for the first time. The rate of reduction in the cost to sequence a persons genome has outpaced even Moores law, from $10 million in 2008 to just $1,000 today. Going forward, this cost is likely to continue dropping and in the near future, we would be able get our complete genome mapped and stored in USB drives or on the cloud for a mere $100. This will open the doors to fantastic possibilities for preventive healthcare and personalized medical treatment. Genome mapping has large implications for agriculture as well, with possibilities like the development of more productive and disease resistant crops, or the creation of diet plans tailored to suit our respective heredities!Disruptions in energy: The end of energy as we know is near. Advancements in technology have reduced the cost of solar energy to 45 cents a watt from $100 a watt in 1970. Interestingly, during this period, other forms of energy have seen a 16-fold increase in price. The average cost of solar panels fell by 75% between 2009 and 2014, and is expected to decline by another 25% by 2018. Solar power tariffs are expected to reach grid parity in India in 2018, and then go below that level. Battery technology is advancing rapidly to help store this energy. Polymer and hybrid-flow battery technology being developed currently will increase energy density, increasing the storage capacity of a given physical space. It is likely that in the near future, many of us will be able to generate, store and use clean solar energy right off our rooftops, at a cost cheaper than buying electricity from the grid. With smart micro-grids, one will even be able to sell excess energy back, creating a truly distributed energy network.Advancements in material science: In Star Trek, the science fiction television show, the crew on-board starships used food replicators to synthesize any meal they wanted while travelling through space. This surreal concept is now inching towards reality. 3D printers have come a long way since the 1980s, and are soon going to be affordable enough for educational and residential usage. Nanomaterials with unique optical, electronic and mechanical properties are driving the next generation of consumer electronics, filtration systems and biomedical treatment. Similarly, advances in biodegradable plastics augur well for environmentally friendly packaging in the future. Ubiquitous digital connectivity: Ubiquitous digital connectivity has been elusive so far although it has been widely talked about by policymakers and technologists. But it is inevitable. Digital access will become more and more affordable as prices reduce. Consumers will increasingly bracket digital connectivity among needs as basic as roti, kapda and makaan (bread, clothes and home), and will allocate a larger share of wallet for it. Digital governance platforms will help governments significantly improve the distribution of subsidy programmes targeted at people with limited means and lastly, corporates that stand to benefit heavily from a burgeoning consumer class may make the economic trade-offs differently. AI and robotics revolution: Artificial intelligence (AI) is already a reality today with Google Search, Siri and IBM Watson being some examples. Todays AI tools excel at complex analytics. In 2016, AI mastered Go, widely considered the most difficult strategy game. However, it struggles with cognitive tasks that a two-year-old can dofor example, knowing the difference between the pictures of a cat and a dog. Genetic algorithms being developed today will strengthen AIs cognitive reasoning capabilities. Limitations on raw computational power will soon be overcome, powering AI tools to do what human brains can. Meanwhile, rapid advances in robotics, such as the development of bio-hybrid robots built using living tissue, are starting to take shape. We are on the cusp of an explosion in AI and robotics, which could make androids a reality in the near future.The interplay between these technology megatrends has the potential to significantly change the world as we know it today. Imagine solar energy-powered 3D printers being airlifted to disaster zones to provide food to people trapped there. Or, a mother in Salem, Tamil Nadu, getting her sons genome mapped, and later getting on a video conference with a New York-based doctor to seek allergy treatment options.Fundamental paradigm shifts driven by accelerating technologyChange in technology fundamentally shifts the production possibility frontier. Every time we hit the law of diminishing returns, newer technology provides a breakthrough. In addition to fundamental shifts in the cost curvewhich are a giventechnology expands the gamut of the possible by significantly altering core trade-offs. Let us look at three conventional business and economic trade-offs, which are getting busted:Two-way real-time interactions versus one-way outreach: In the past, businesses could either focus on rich information tailored to a niche market or reach out to a larger market that sacrificed richness for the additional reach. However, today, two-way, real-time communication with rich and relevant content has become a reality. Digital technology enables access to global platforms for buying and selling, marketing and financing from anywhere. Advanced analytics, combined with mobile technology, is allowing companies to target each consumer individually, across their entire client base. For example, if it is raining, your regular coffee shop can tempt you to brave the weather and visit it by offering you a promotional scheme on your favourite drink, through an app on your smartphone.Supply and demand mismatch: With the shift towards elimination of bespoke hardware, and value migrating to software, it is possible today to match supply with demand almost perfectly. Increased access and connectivity via technology is driving a revolution in the sharing economy as well. Sharing is not new to us. The barter system has been in place for centuries, long before money was invented. Today, we are not only sharing digital information, we are also sharing physical things like homes and vehicles with each other, using digital market places.Scale versus cost: Technology is not only rapidly reducing servicing costs, it is also increasingly enabling businesses to move to an opex spend model, from the erstwhile capex heavy approach. This is helping expand firms reach to new consumers at a faster rate than ever before. For example, consumers with very low deposits can be served economically in an opex spend model, telecom base stations no longer need minimum efficient scale, retail distribution can be customized economically at a micro-market level, and 3D printing can significantly change manufacturing scale. SPECIFIC IMPLICATIONS OF ACCELERATING TECHNOLOGY FOR INDIARadical innovation with next-generation technology architecture:The Internet has served as the main platform for disruption across industries. Its architecture is decentralized, modular and stacked. Lower down the stack, the focus is on scale and efficient utilization, for example, server capacity. Higher up the stack, however, the focus is on content related to user needs and innovation. This stack-based architecture eliminates the trade-off between efficiency and innovation, as higher-layer innovators can rent scale from lower-level platform providers to conduct experiments at lower costs. This is already a reality in our lives. Case in point, Uber, which uses a stacked architecture comprising GPS, Google Maps, electronic payments and connected smartphonesnone of which it ownsto offer a disruptive and consumer-friendly transportation solution.In India, we are witnessing the rising usage of a similar stacked architecture, called the India Stack, in the financial services sector. Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar and mobile phones have created a fundamental layer of customer identification and access, on which multiple digital transactions can be built. This has the potential to solve our financial inclusion problem by eliminating the classical roadblocks of paper-based identity proofs, interaction with a physical bank and the availability of hard cash. The entire stack is an open resource, which means anyone can access and leverage it. A similar open stack architecture is being used by the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) to provide a platform for tax data management and reporting. The platform will provide the plumbing to bring together all GSTN stakeholders including taxpayers, banks, and central and state governments to completely transform Indias tax landscape.This is paradigm shift in technology architecture where innovation happens at the bottom of the stack and is available as a public good at a very low cost to everybody. The implications of this shift are quite profound and if deployed well can be used to address some of our very core socio-economic challenges.Ability to address Indias chronic challenges: Healthcare is one of the most complex challenges of our time, with the infrastructure and capital required to fix the problems and reduce the inequity in healthcare access being insufficient so far. Despite making progress over the last decade, India accounts for a disproportionate percentage of global incidences of disease. We have seven doctors for every 10,000 people, which is only half the average global doctor-patient ratio. Large-scale change is never easy, but technology holds extraordinary promise in helping address our healthcare challenges.By leveraging the technology stack already in placewide connectivity through mobile phones and high-speed data networks, Aadhaar, digitization of health recordswe can significantly improve every element of our health system, from education for prevention, to treatment and management. Big Data and analytics can fundamentally alter healthcare delivery and transform our public health and medical research initiatives through the establishment of national registries. India can become data-rich very rapidly. And a nationwide, connected, many-to-many health information highway with common data standards and interoperability features can just be what the doctor ordered! A similar approach can also be deployed in critical areas such as education and skilling, and it can fundamentally transform how India teaches and learns.Enabling organizations to be trailblazers: Historically, Indian firms have found it hard to address the challenges of low average purchasing power, lack of minimum efficient scale and widespread socio-economic inequity. With the acceleration of technology, these challenges get decimated. Acceleration in technology, coupled with relatively lower legacy investments, gives Indian firms the opportunity to leapfrog their peers to become global trailblazers. Technology makes investments modular, reducing capital outlays and experimentation costs, while increasing speed and agility, which are critical advantages in todays dynamic macroeconomic environment. There is every reason to believe that the next Alibaba, Amazon, Google, Tesla or Uber can emerge out of India.GOING FORWARD, WE NEED TO ADDRESS THREE KEY AREAS TO UNLOCK THIS TECHNOLOGY REVOLUTION1. How do we ensure sufficient investment in infrastructure at the lower level of the stack?Private returns on infrastructure investments are often substantially lower than the underlying social benefits generated. While benefits accrue to the economy at large through positive externalities, this does not assure returns for the infrastructure investor. Also, when infrastructure investment requires an entirely new generation of expensive technology, such as fibre, 4G or 5G, it can compound market failure. The government, through policy formulation, has a key role to play in encouraging sufficient investment in infrastructure.2. What changes should be make in our education system to equip our youth for the technology revolution?There is a need to rethink technology and vocational skills being imparted at higher education institutions. Future jobs will be very different from those in the market today. In addition to solving the existing challenges our education system faces, we need to ensure that it equips our youth with the necessary multidisciplinary skills to meet the needs of tomorrow. 3. How do we drive collaboration across stakeholders to unlock the full potential of technology-enabled transformation?The government, large corporates, start-ups and NGOs have different strengths and capabilities. There is a need to draw upon the expertise of all these stakeholders, and marrying together their complementary skills. We need the right policies and construct for public-social-private partnerships to make this happen.In summary, technological change is accelerating at an unprecedented pace and will change the world as we know it. If we get our act right as a nation over the next decade, technology can help us take India back 1,000 yearswhen we were the most advanced and thriving economy in the world.Neeraj Aggarwal is managing director, and Rohit Ramesh is partner and director at BCG India.",2016-10-19,UoAUwuuIFV498ndi95U3PI,"If we get our act right, technology can help us take India back 1,000 yearswhen we were the most advanced and thriving economy in the world",04:59,Accelarating technology: Indias opportunity to leapfrog

				Your home is ready to rise and shine, the virtual assistant replied.Inside this four-bedroom stucco house in Alameda, California, Kaiserman, president of the technology division at construction company Lennar Corp., was pitching a vision of a home controlled via iPhone or iPad.Tap your phone, and AC/DCs Back in Black blasts. Tap again, and the bath runs at a blissful 101 degrees. Sweet, right? Of course, your dad might view it as a bit over the top. All told, $30,000 worth of gadgets and gizmos were on display here, many run with Apples free HomeKit app. As iPhone sales growth slows, Apple is teaming up with a handful of builders and using these kinds of test beds to inch its way into the market for Internet-connected home furnishings, a nascent field that has attracted rivals like Alphabet Inc.s Google and Amazon.com Inc.Video Doorbells?The gamble is that pricey wireless home devices will be an easier sell when bundled into the home itself. Builders market granite countertops and brushed-nickel fixtures at thousands of models homes across the U.S. Why not video doorbells?Unlike Google and Amazon, however, Apple isnt hawking hardware meant to connect the home. Instead, the HomeKit app could increase the value of its iOS ecosystem -- and make it tougher for users to switch to Android phones and tablets. Also read: Why Nokia couldnt beat the iPhoneWe want to bring home automation to the mainstream, said Greg Joswiak, Apples vice president of product marketing. The best place to start is at the beginning, when a house is just being created.The convenience on display in the Alameda stucco doesnt come cheap. A single motorized, battery-operated Lutron shade starts at $349. Or consider the Schlage touchscreen deadbolt, which can be controlled remotely, so you can text an unexpected visitor a code. It can retail for $200. A regular deadbolt fetches $32 at Home Depot -- and theres always hiding a key under the flower pot.In Fremont, California, about 15 minutes from Facebook Inc.s headquarters, Los Angeles-based KB Home is also getting its own Apple house ready.

With a good morning, it switches to white.KB offers wireless devices as upgrades. A basic package runs about $2,000, which once rolled into a mortgage is pennies a month, according to spokesman Craig LeMessurier. Lennar builds the cost into the price of homes. The Alameda house sells for $1.2 million, though it was a beta model and an actual dwelling wouldnt include $30,000 worth of gadgets.Apple is also working with Brookfield Residential Properties Inc. and other builders. The companies declined to say when the homes would go on sale.Consumers will buy about $24 billion worth of connected home devices in 2016, according to Strategy Analytics Inc. Though thats a drop in the bucket compared with smartphones, the research and consulting firm expects those sales to nearly double by 2020.For most people, connected homes remain a ways off, said Jonathan Gaw, an analyst with research firm IDC. The proliferating devices remain difficult to install in older homes and, in some cases, seem useless. Gaw cites the wireless candle he saw the other day.Give me a break, he said. That only hurts the message. It tells people that we have gone too far. Theres too much crap out there, its only diluting stuff thats really cool.Wi-Fi OnesieEven some who sell such gadgets say the hype may be getting ahead of the reality. The discount retailer Target Corp. opened its own Target Open House showroom a year ago in San Francisco. Shoppers walk through a futuristic home, watching prerecorded displays projected onto its transparent acrylic walls and furniture.In the nursery, a baby wears a Wi-Fi onesie -- made by a company called Mimo, founded by whizzes from MIT. It tracks the infants breathing, skin temperature, sleep and body position. When she stirs, it triggers the homes lights, turns on soothing music on the Sonos wireless speakers and even tells the coffee maker downstairs to start brewing java for red-eyed parents.You can pick one up for $199. Many parents brew the coffee themselves and let their babies wail -- or buy a traditional baby monitor for as little as $19.99. Connected home devices can cost five times the price of the old-fashioned version, according to Target spokeswoman Jenna Reck.The smart home will get there but its not there yet, Reck said. Adoption is happening even slower than people predicted.Disobedient DevicesAs with all things tech, there is the matter of glitches, frustration and complexity. Markus Giesler, 40, equipped his 1924 house with an Apple home system so he could be a subject for his own academic research at the Schulich School of Business at York University in Canada.When the associate professor of marketing pulls up to the house in his BMW, the GPS on his phone alerts the garage door to open and turns on lights in various colors and brightness throughout his home, depending on his preferences and the time of day. At least, in theory, they do.Certain devices obey, and some do not, Giesler said.Homebuilders started offering smart devices such as automatic locks and thermostats more than five years ago. In its current model homes, Miami-based Lennar works with a company called Nexia, a unit of Ingersoll-Rand Plc.Lennars Kaiserman hopes working with Apple will have a halo effect, helping convince customers that a new home in a subdivision can be a cool alternative to an existing one.No doubt, Apple would be heartened by the experience of Ken Bieber. Last year, Bieber, a 39-year-old executive at a consulting firm, bought a $357,000 Lennar smart home after visiting a model north of Tampa, Florida.With his Nexia system, his lights automatically start dimming in the evening, signaling that its time to get ready for bed. When his wife, April, went into labor two months ago, he stayed with her in the hospital and texted a temporary entry code to a friend who walked the dog.Since buying his house, Bieber has spent another $1,000 for wireless motion detectors, a video camera and controls for his light dimmers, ceiling fans and irrigation system.Neighbors ask him for advice on their own smart home device purchases, and he plans to add motorized blinds. Ill be watching a movie and suddenly I have to get up and pull blinds -- apparently its just too much for me at that point, Bieber said. Im so used to saying things and they just happen. BloombergWith assistance from Alex Webb",2016-10-19,W9kvhREszSoZo4H8q8LS4L,"As iPhone sales growth slows, Apple is teaming up with a handful of builders to inch its way into the market for Internet-connected home furnishings",22:14,Apple wants to get inside your home before you even buy it
11,0.237525,"Saudi Arabia will soon choose a site for its first nuclear power plant as the worlds biggest crude exporter seeks to diversify its sources of energy.
				   
				We will be selecting sites very soon that we will reserve for our first nuclear energy power plant, Khalid Al-Falih, the countrys energy minister, said Wednesday at the Oil and Money conference in London. We hope within the next 12 months that we will be announcing concrete plans. The government wants to make sure all regulatory steps are taken beforehand, he said. Wind and solar power will also play a very significant part of Saudi Arabias energy mix, Al-Falih said. Saudi Arabia, which laid out its ambitions for diversifying energy supplies in 2012, is trying to reduce the economys dependence on hydrocarbons as low oil prices strain the budget. The country raised $17.5 billion this week in the biggest bond sale from an emerging-market nation as it seeks to bridge a deficit that widened last year to about 15 percent of gross domestic product.UAE ReactorsThe kingdom has a target of generating 6 to 7 gigawatts of electricity from nuclear power by 2032, rising to 17 gigawatts by 2040, Maher al-Odan, an adviser to the government on renewables planning, said in April of last year. Abu Dhabi in the neighboring United Arab Emirates is building the Gulf Arab regions first nuclear power plant. The reactor, one of four that the emirate is planning, is scheduled for completion in 2017. Emirates Nuclear Energy Corp. and Korea Electric Power Corp. signed a joint-venture agreement on Thursday for a long-term partnership in the U.A.E.s nuclear program, ENEC said in an e-mailed statement. Korea Electric is taking an 18 percent stake in a venture representing the commercial interests of the U.A.E.s Barakah nuclear-plant project, with ENEC holding the rest, according to the statement. Construction of the U.A.E.s four reactors is more than 71 percent complete, and all the plants are to be finished in 2020, ENEC said. The U.A.E., like Saudi Arabia, a fellow member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, is trying to reduce its reliance on oil exports. It expects to produce nearly a quarter of its electricity from nuclear energy by 2020, according to ENECs website.

421,0.22335,"Bengaluru: Wipro Ltd will spend $500 million to buy Appirio Inc., an Indianapolis, US-based cloud services firm, underlining the aggressive acquisition-based strategy Indias third largest software services firm has scripted for its transformation.
				   
				Appirio helps companies move applications to hosted servers offered by Amazon, Google and Salesforce.com.The privately held company, founded in 2006, has raised more than $110 million from investors including Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic, and counts Facebook, Home Depot and IBM as its clients. It is estimated to have revenue of more than $200 million.Wipro chief executive officer Abidali Z. Neemuchwala said it is important for companies to transform the way they engage with customers and employees by leveraging the power of the cloud. Since Neemuchwala joined the company in April last year, Wipro has spent $1.13 billion to buy four companies, including Appirio.Wipro spent $95 million in July 2015 to buy Denmark-based design firm Designit, with a revenue of $30 million, to give a boost to its newly created business division, Wipro Digital.In December, it paid $78 million to buy Cellent, a German technology company with over $90 million in revenue, that implements and maintains SAP software for clients in automobile and manufacturing segments. In February, Wipro paid $460 million to buy HealthPlan Services, a Florida, US-based technology firm that brings over $220 million in business by offering solutions to health insurance firms. Wipro also tried buying Viteos Group but later called off the buyout, citing inordinate delays in the completion of the acquisition. The Times of India first reported the Appirio deal.Wipros decision to buy Appirio mirrors the approach followed by its larger peers Accenture Plc. and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM). Accenture bought Salesforce partner, Cloud Sherpas in September last year while IBM bought Salesforce partner Bluewolf Group in April this year.This deal is about giving Wipro the capabilities to scale out IT services in the cloud world. What it gains are some strong methodologies in delivering in the cloud, and  significant partnerships such as Workday, Salesforce, Amazon, and Google, said Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm.More importantly, Wipro can take those methodologies and scale out to adjust for building revenue in the cloud. Every vendor is trying to figure out how to scale out cloud services and make money. Appirio and its chief competitor Blue Wolf have been the pioneers in this field.Cloud computing poses a threat to companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Wipro, whose customers  have started to use hosted servers. This means system integrators no longer just lose business in buying hardware and writing software needed for large data centres but even lose out in revenue which comes from maintaining the applications which move to hosted servers. The applications which moved to the hosted servers offered by Amazon and Microsoft use artificial intelligence and automation platform technologies which can be managed by  significantly fewer engineers.

81,0.140725,"Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is likely to report an increase in its quarterly profit, as stronger petrochemical margins offset weaker earnings from its refining business. 
				   
				Consolidated net profit is likely to increase to Rs7,282.5 crore on a revenue of Rs63,669.9 crore for the three months ended on 30 September, according to a Bloomberg poll of six analysts. In the year-earlier quarter, the company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs6,720 crore and revenue of Rs75,117 crore. RIL will announce its second-quarter earnings on Thursday. After six consecutive sequential earnings increases, we expect RILs standalone earnings to moderate 2% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), mainly due to weaker refining. But, RIL may surprise again. We expect another record petchem EBIT, said Nomura Research in a 7 October note to clients. Ebit stands for earnings before interest and taxes and is an indication of a companys profitability. RILs refining and marketing business, which accounts for over 75% of revenue and more than 60% of profit, could be hurt due to lower refining margins.Analysts expect RILs gross refining margin (GRM) to be $9.5-10 per barrel. GRM is the realization from turning every barrel of crude oil into finished products. We estimate GRM to be down 10% QoQ (quarter on quarter) while throughput 7% higher QoQ following a restart of special economic zone crude distillation unit after 20 days maintenance shutdown in May 2016. Refining EBITDA will therefore fall 6% QoQ, said Edelweiss Research in a 5 October report. During the September quarter, Singapore GRM averaged at $5.1 per barrel compared with $5 in the preceding three months.We expect RIL to report a $10 GRM versus $11.5 in 1Q, the latter including $2 of hedging & inventory gains, said Citi Research in its report dated 4 October. Earnings from the petrochemicals segment, however, are expected to rise on higher volume and wider margins. We expect petchem earnings to show strong growth led by higher volumes (some expansion projects are gradually reflecting in earnings) and improved spreads in the polymer chain, said IDFC Securities in a report dated 5 October. On the exploration and production (E&P) front, which includes domestic assets and US shale gas assets, the second quarter could also be a loss-making one for RIL as crude oil and domestic gas prices are lower compared to last year. Production from the KG block is also expected to be lower. RIL is likely to report losses in a small EBIT profit on domestic E&P. US shale will continue to remain loss-making. Crude oil and domestic gas prices are lower year-on-year. KG D6 production is expected to be down 3% year-on-year, said Bank of America Merrill Lynch in a report dated 10 October. Though RIL launched its telecom services on 5 September, the numbers are not likely to be included in September quarter. We do not expect the company to account for Jio in its consolidated results despite its launch in September as it is currently being offered to customers for free.

				Aggregate losses of these discoms are expected to decline by 46% to about Rs.20,000 crore from Rs.37,000 crore now, Crisil said in a report.This gap or loss is calculated as average revenue realised minus average cost of supply. The gap will still be well above the nil that UDAY targets because some states with high aggregated technical and commercial (AT&C) losses are not adequately prepared for various reasons, the report said.Rajasthan, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, and Uttarakhand are expected to fare better in the implementation of UDAY, so are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries. However, UP, Bihar and Jammu and Kashmir are expected to be the laggards. These three states would account for almost two-thirds of the gap in fiscal 2019, said Gurpreet Chhatwal, business head - large corporates, Crisil Ratings.State discoms have collectively borrowed more than Rs.4 trillion till the end of March 2015.The government had launched the UDAY scheme last year for operational and financial turnaround of power discoms.

332,0.241625,"Moscow/London: Two years ago, the Kremlins oil flagship was foundering, hit by falling prices and international sanctions just as it faced $20 billion in debt payments.
				   
				Short of cash, Rosneft got about $15 billion of emergency aid with help from the central bank. But the deal spooked investors, requiring a massive rate increase to stem market turmoil. Chief executive officer Igor Sechin, the man Vladimir Putin had for a decade relied on to build Rosneft into a giant, faced rare disfavour from his patron, senior officials said at the time.Now, Putin is turning to Rosneft for help. Sechins energy colossus is helping fill a yawning budget gap at home and support the Kremlin abroad. The companys turnaround is a triumph for the Russian president, who vowed to protect the pillars of his state-dominated system from US and European Union pressure when they were slapped with sanctions two years ago.Russia is among dozens of petro-states that are learning to make do with less as oil prices show no signs of major recovery. For some, like Saudi Arabia, the rout has provided an added impetus for economic overhauls, while othersincluding Putins Russiathe priority has been to paper over cracks with short-term fixes that dont reduce their reliance on petroleum.Also Read: Rosneft buy of Bashneft gives impetus to privatization: Vladimir PutinIts very important to the Kremlin that Rosneft is a strong company, said James Henderson, a former banker who is now a senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. Russias foreign policy as much as domestic policy relies on it.Shopping spreeJust last week, Rosneft spent 330 billion rubles ($5 billion) to buy control of another oil company from the government, the biggest privatization deal yet this year. Then Putin backed a plan under which Rosneft could provide an even bigger cash infusion, spending as much as $11 billion to buy a chunk of its own shares from the government. On 15 October, it announced a deal to buy a big refinery and other assets in India, under which it will pay $3.5 billion for a 49% stake. Putin presided over the signing of that agreement on a visit to Goa, confirming that Rosneft remains a favoured Kremlin tool for binding political ties with business links.Even Putin seemed surprised at Rosnefts recovery. At a meeting with budget officials, he said hed instructed the appropriate agencies to check that Rosneft had the funds on its accounts and wouldnt need to borrow to make the payments to the government.The Kremlin, too, has managed to weather the worst of the pain so far, thanks to billions in petrodollars saved up when oil prices were high, the sharp devaluation of the ruble and help from China and other friends outside the West. His economy steadying, Putin shows no sign of softening his confrontational approach to the US and Europe. Hes pushing his advantage in Syria, moving new missiles to Europes borders and, according to US intelligence, deploying hackers to meddle in the presidential elections.The key to Rosnefts turnaroundeven as oil prices have languishedwas a combination of financial engineering, the weakened ruble, political support and a little help from some friends: billions of dollars in advance payments from buyers in China. Rosnefts cash pile stood at more than $22 billion at the end of the second quarter, almost double what it had early last year.A Rosneft spokesman didnt respond to a request for comment for this article.Once an also-ran made up of the scraps of the Soviet oil industry that the 1990s oligarchs didnt want, Rosnefts fortunes turned as Putin moved to restore Kremlin control of the strategic sector in the early 2000s. He installed fellow intelligence veteran Sechin to lead the company in 2004. Rosneft took over the bulk of Yukos, a company the government seized from Putin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky. In 2013 Rosneft became the largest publicly traded oil producer on the planet when it purchased TNK-BP, a venture of the British company and a trio of Russian billionaires, for more than $50 billion. It borrowed more than $30 billion for that deal, one of the largest-ever financings by a Russian company.But soon after the TNK-BP deal, Rosnefts proximity to Putin became a liability.Also Read: Will Rosneft deal benefit Essar Oil shareholders?Eager to hit the Russian leader in his pocketbook after the March 2014 annexation of Crimea, the US announced sanctions targeting Sechin, citing his utter loyalty to Vladimir Putin. Later, the US and EU slapped limits on Rosneft, restricting access to technology and capital markets. Igor sanctionForeign lenders whod once battled for Rosnefts favour couldnt do business with it. BPs CEO joked that Sechins new nickname was Igor Sanction.By that fall, Rosneft was again walloped as oil fell below $100. Soon, it was asking the Kremlin for a $43 billion rescue. Putin balked at the huge sum, which was nearly as big as the bailouts the largest US banks got back in 2009 and would have used up much of one of Russias two sovereign wealth funds.The crisis of 2014 made investors panic, said Oleg Popov, a Moscow money manager who owns Rosnefts bonds. It was a perfect storm.But just days before a $7 billion payment to western banks came due in December 2014, Rosneft got its lifeline. Through a complicated series of transactions that stretched over several months, it issued 1 trillion rubles in bonds that a local bank used as collateral to borrow as much as $15 billion from the Russian central bank to lend on to the oil giant. The state bank that came up with the scheme couldnt participate because of sanctions, so Rosneft took the idea to another lender, according to a person familiar with the deals. Apparently fearful the US could extend the restrictions to squeeze the institution involved, Rosneft kept the nature of the deal a secret.But when word of the bond issue leaked out, its huge size alarmed local investors, who dumped the ruble.Only an emergency 6.5-percentage-point rate hike and heavy Kremlin pressure on exporters to sell foreign currency were enough to stabilize the exchange rate. Sechin publicly denied any role in the rubles plunge, threatening to deal with provocateurs who alleged the company was involved. Rosnefts London-traded shares dropped to the lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis.Putin criticismThe botched bailout angered top officials including Putin, people familiar with the situation said at the time. Sechin faced a rare public criticism from the president in a late-night meeting. A prominent Moscow newspaper editor tweeted that rumors were swirling among the capitals elite gathered at the Bolshoi Theater for a ballet premiere that Sechin was about to be fired. Rosneft denied it.Sechin tried to make amends, selling tens of billions of dollars earned from oil sales to buy rubles, helping steady the currency. He cut capital spending. To raise cash, the company pitched stakes in major Siberian projects to investors in China and India.The plunging ruble became a blessing, lowering Rosnefts costs in dollar terms and cushioning the blow of low oil prices, since crude is sold in dollars. A fifty-dollar barrel is worth 53% more, in ruble terms, today than it was two years ago.Also Read: Essar Oil-Rosneft deal likely to escape capital gains tax due to Mauritius treatyFurther relief came when customersnever publicly identified by Rosneft, but assumed by analysts to be led by state-controlled China National Petroleum Corp.made $15 billion in prepayments for future crude supplies in the third quarter of 2015. By early this year, Sechin had reclaimed his traditional position in Putins good books, touting Rosnefts results in a personal meeting with the leader. He also installed a veteran executive whod built up government connections during a stint as a deputy energy minister, Pavel Fedorov, as his de-facto No. 2.Rosnefts market capitalization topped that of Gazprom, the state gas monopoly and its traditional rival for political affections, for the first time in April. BP, which owns a 20% stake in Rosneft, reported that its share of the Russian companys profits last year contributed almost a quarter of its earnings, the largest share ever. In June, Sechin said he thought his company could be worth as much as $130 billion, twice its current value and more than BP. Crude production would be up after several years of declines, he said.By accidentOver the last year, we cut our debt load in half, he told state television. For a company like ours thats under sanctions, thats a brilliant result, he added. Topping the market-capitalization ranks of Russian companies just happened by accident, he said with a smile.Still, investors have cause for skepticism. In its presentations, Rosneft doesnt count the billions of dollars of pre-payments as debt. Rating agencies believe it should, since the company has to repay them, with interest, in oil. When the prepayments are included, Rosneft had reduced its net debt since 2013 by only about $6 billion as of the end of the second quarter, according to Alexey Bulgakov, an analyst at Sberbank-CIB in Moscow. That compares with the companys claim to have cut net debt by more than $22 billion over the period.S&P Global Ratings this month called Rosnefts financial policy aggressive, warning that future acquisitions could lead debt to spike.The company faces as much as $16 billion in debt repayments before the end of next year, including the bulk of the central-bank facility, which the regulator is eager to see repaid, according to officials. At the same time, Rosneft still is pumping money into projects in Venezuela, where the business outlook is murky at best but the Kremlin is eager to maintain political ties.Goldman Sachs this week cut Rosneft shares to neutral from buy, warning that the company could start diverting its cash to value-eroding M&A.Political controlEven Rosnefts plan to buy its own shares is in part a reflection of weakness. The government efforts to find other buyers for the 19.5% stake it wants to unload have fallen flat, leaving Rosneft itself as the acquirer of last resort. Real privatization would happen at a later date, with Rosneft reselling it to unspecified outside investors at higher prices, Putin told reporters on the trip to India last weekend. On that visit, a jacket-less Sechin was sighted playing pool with the head of a state bank during a break in the talks. (Sechin won.)Concerns about the giant companys efficiency were among the reasons Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and senior members of his cabinet cited in opposing Rosnefts bid for Bashneft, the company Rosneft bought in the privatization this month. They argued the sale should be used to boost the private sector. But Rosneft offered as much as $1 billion more than rival bidders and after months of mixed signals, Putin ruled against his officials, saying he was a bit surprised theyd ever been opposed.The current leadership believes that political control is more important than market efficiency, said Edward Chow, a former Chevron executive who is now a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

299,0.24855,"The announcement of the imminent commercial launch of services by its telecom unitReliance Jio Infocomm Ltdat its annual general meeting has augured well for the Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) stock. Its share price has risen 7.5% from its recent low on 2 September. But its worth remembering that the stock has been an underperformer compared to the benchmark Sensex so far this year.
				   
				If you thought September quarter results would change sentiments dramatically, you are likely be disappointed. Stand-alone revenues have declined year-on-year but better operating profit margin, strong other income growth, and decline in finance and depreciation costs have helped the company report 20% growth in its pre-tax earnings. But that wont impress investors. Heres why: stand-alone Ebitda for September quarter came in at Rs10,555 crore. A poll of Bloomberg analysts was expecting the companys Ebitda at Rs10,569 crore. Thats pretty much in line. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.Unlike the June quarter when RILs gross refining margin (GRM) had surprised the Street positively, this quarter was fairly lukewarm. To be fair, GRM of $10.1 a barrel is not bad at all. The companys premium over Singapore GRM has dropped to $5 a barrel from as much as $6.5 a barrel. But investors are unlikely to punish the stock for that. For one, the companys GRM margin is slightly better than some brokerage firms estimates. Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd was expecting a GRM of $10 a barrel while analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd had forecasted a GRM between $9.5-10 a barrel.What really came as a big surprise this quarter is the performance of the petrochemicals business. According to the company, consolidated petrochemicals Ebit margin expanded to a 14-quarter high of 15.2% for the September quarter as product deltas held up well despite lower prices. Delta is the rate of change in prices compared with the change in unit costs. Strong volume growth also helped. Stand-alone petrochemicals Ebit increased to 16.3%, higher sequentially as well as on a year-on-year basis.As usual, the oil and gas business was a laggard, with Ebit declining as much as 83% year-on-year, adversely impacted by lower upstream production in domestic blocks along with lower prices. Sure, RILs organized retail business has done well but the segment is too small to make a big difference to overall numbers.On a consolidated basis, the companys debt service coverage ratio has declined to 0.88 from 2.79 in the June quarter. Is that a worry? According to independent analyst S.P. Tulsian, the decline in debt service coverage ratio should hardly be a concern for a company with RILs cash flows. Other analysts say the fall in the debt service ratio below 1 is just for one quarter and should not be extrapolated.What of the stock? Currently, RIL trades at 12.4 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year. Valuations arent exactly cheap considering that the refining environment is still sluggish. So far this quarter, benchmark Singapore GRM has averaged only marginally higher at $5.3 a barrel, says an analyst. RILs net debt has increased by about Rs10,000 crore sequentially to Rs1.06 trillion. Investors should watch out for that measure in the days to come.

59,0.2051,"New York: AT&T is reportedly on the verge of announcing yet another massive merger, this time with $71 billion Time Warner. The goal here sort of makes sense: AT&T has the distribution network and it wants the content of Time Warner, parent of HBO, CNN and TBS.
				   
				But should AT&T follow through with a Time Warner purchase, its debt may balloon to levels that would put it at risk of a downgrade. Thats a significant concern for both AT&T, the second-largest US wireless carrier, and the broader $8 trillion corporate-bond market, considering that this company already has more than $120 billion of debt outstanding.Lets put that debt load into context. Its more than any other non-financial issuer in the US corporate bond market and more than four times as much as the biggest US junk-bond seller.At a minimum, any downgrade would dent the value of AT&Ts debt and send its borrowing costs higher. So what would it take for that to happen? Its current rating is BBB+ at S&P, three levels above junk, after being cut in 2015 in the wake of its $18.2 billion purchase of AWS-3 wireless spectrum licenses. AT&T has said it wants to reduce debt to regain its higher rating, but this deal very well could move it in the opposite direction.Lets say it were to pay all cash for the transaction and a 20% premium to Time Warners current market value, which has already risen amid the takeover speculation. AT&T would have to borrow billions of dollars in additional debt because it currently only has $7.2 billion of cash on its books. Net debt would then potentially surge to more than three times the combined Ebitda that AT&T and Time Warner are forecast to generate next year. That would be enough for a downgrade, according to a recent S&P Global Ratings report.AT&T is already nearing its leverage limits for its current rating at Moodys, so a material increase in debt over Ebitda will put it at risk for a downgrade at that credit-rating company.This is all hypothetical, of course, and if recent reports are correct that an agreement could be reached as soon as this weekend, well learn the actual deal terms soon enough. Bloomberg reported late Friday that AT&T is talking about buying Time Warner for about $110 a share, in a deal structured as half stock, half cash. While that wouldnt boost AT&Ts overall leverage ratio as much as if the carrier used all cash, it will still probably require its incurring more debt. That means the combined company needs to demonstrate its even more profitable than the two separate corporations or else face higher debt-to-income ratios, and a possible downgrade. The potential for this type of disruptive development happening matters greatly at a time when investors are pouring near-record amounts of cash into the US credit market. Just last year, a Moodys downgrade of Sprint, the biggest US junk-bond issuer, sparked a tumble in that wireless carriers debt and sent jitters through the high-yield market, showing how unsettling it can be when a dominant corporate-bond sellers rating is cut. And in Sprints case it was already junk-rated. Were AT&T to lose its investment-grade status, that could trigger more disruption as some bondholders cant hold high-yield debt and would be forced to sell. AT&T still has a fairly long way to fall before it loses its high-grade status, but a massive deal like this needs to be monitored closely by credit investors to make sure that its creating more value than its destroying.Investment-grade corporate bonds are poised for their best annual performance since 2009. Going forward, its idiosyncratic events like this that may drive whether the investments remain winners or turn into losers.

				Bengaluru-based Wipro does not give an annual forecast (it provides quarterly guidance) and for this reason, it has clarified that this should not be interpreted as a target.Still, Wipro, which over the last few years has struggled to keep pace with its larger rivals, believes that measures taken since February this year to generate more business from existing clients, investments in building capabilities in new technologies, such as cloud computing platforms and Internet of things, and an aggressive mergers and acquisitions (M&A) strategy should help it get to industry-matching growth.Im always careful of putting a timeline and so I believe it is not unreasonable to expect this industry-matching growth number by March 2018, Neemuchwala said in an interview on Friday.I feel very confident and I see that green shoots (are) coming in a more sustainable manner. Im very hopeful that four-five quarters is a good time for a very visible outcome or metric for an industry-leading growth or margin.Also see | What ails Indian IT?Wipro under Neemuchwala, who joined the company in April last year as chief operating officer and was elevated to his current role as CEO in February, posted a 0.8% decline in dollar revenue growth in the second quarter, mirroring the growth pangs faced by countrys $150 billion outsourcing sector. Wipros large rivals, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd, run the risk of slower growth this year than the 7.1% and 9.1% growth recorded last year. To be sure, some of the early signs of the measures taken have started reflecting well, with the company improving its ability to generate more business from existing clients, and arresting declining profitability.Wipro has managed to improve average revenue per client to about $6.6 million at the end of September from $6 million at the start of the financial year in April.The firm managed to hold on to a 17.8% operating margin, same as during the April-June period, despite giving salary raises to close to 174,000 employees during the July-September period. Wipros margins had narrowed sharply after it reported 19.7% profitability in the March quarter. Wipros muted 0-2% QoQ dollar revenue growth guidance for third quarter is a disappointment and belies hopes for a turnaround in the core business.

174,0.084225,"New Delhi: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), operator of the worlds biggest oil-refining complex, has forayed into cooking gas retailing, launching a 4-kg LPG cylinder on pilot basis. Four-kg LPG cylinder launched in 4 districts on pilot basis, RIL said in an investor presentation on second-quarter earnings. 
				   
				LPG consumption is growing by over 10% and private refiners RIL and Essar Oil want a pie of it. Currently, public sector retailers Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum control retail LPG market, selling cooking gas in 5-kg, 14.2-kg and 19-kg cylinders. They sell 12 cylinders of 14.2-kg or 34 bottles of 5-kg per year to households on subsidized rates and any requirement above that on market price. The 19-kg cylinder is for commercial use. Private firms are not entitled for government subsidy and they have to sell fuel at market price. But with the government restricting volume of subsidy as well as barring consumers earning more than Rs10 lakh per annum from subsidised LPG, a ready-made market is now available for private oil companies. Mobile App rolled in all operating states to enhance customer experience, RIL said in the presentation. The company sells most of the LPG produced by its twin refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat to public sector retailers. While RIL did not disclose the price at which it is marketing the 4-kg cylinder, a 5-kg subsidized domestic LPG cylinder costs Rs58.50 in Delhi. A 5-kg cylinder for domestic use is priced at Rs181 while it costs Rs252.50 for non-domestic use. A subsidised 14.2-kg cylinder costs Rs427 in Delhi and a non-subsidized bottle comes for Rs490. A 19-kg cylinder is priced at Rs895. Domestic LPG consumption rose 10.8% in April-September this year to 10.2 million tonnes, nearly half of which was imported. The government had last year permitted RIL to sell up to 1.2 lakh tonnes of LPG produced at its plants to private cooking gas marketers. The LPG Control Order mandates that all cooking gas (LPG) produced locally must be supplied to state-run fuel retailing companies as India is deficient in LPG and has to import a part of the requirement. However, under the Parallel Marketing Scheme (PMS), private companies are allowed to import and market LPG to bulk consumers. Packed LPG business sales grew at 10% year-on-year basis, the company said in the presentation.

230,0.24995,"For the past two decades, every time the management of Dabur India Ltd met to finalize a new product, it ended up also debating whether to stick to Ayurveda or to focus on non-Ayurvedic products.
				   
				The decision to launch non-Ayurvedic products came 113 years after S.K. Burman set up Dabur in 1884 in Kolkata. In 1997, the home-grown Ayurvedic products maker launched Project STARS (Strive to Achieve Record Successes) to accelerate growth through diversification. It launched Real, a fruit-based beverage.Ayurveda cannot take Dabur far, the Burmans were convinced. So, the family that popularized Ayurveda in India moved away from its core strength.Over the next 19 years, the companys focus intensified so much on non-Ayurveda products that just the food business accounted for about 11% of its Rs8,436 crore revenue in the year to March 2016 and 18% of domestic sales came from foods. Not just food, it launched a number of non-Ayurvedic products in segments like personal care and home care as well. Overall, about 40% of its sales came from non-Ayurvedic products in the year to March 2016. The wheel of change was set for a spin. But then came yoga-guru-turned-businessman Baba Ramdev. Under his company Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd, he launched a range of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) based on Ayurveda. In recent months, ever since Patanjali started aggressive advertising on television, it has challenged companies such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), Colgate-Palmolive (India) Ltd, Nestlé India Ltd that compete in Indias Rs3.2 trillion-a-year consumer packaged goods market.Theres more. Going by Ramdevs projections, Patanjali will cross Rs10,000 crore in revenue in fiscal year 2017from Rs5,000 crore in FY16. This is more than what brokerage firm Morgan Stanley India Co. Pvt Ltd projected as Dabur Indias revenue in FY17Rs 9,630 crore.Besides, Dabur started feeling the pinch as sales of its honey (a product that is estimated to have more than 65% market share) started declining earlier this year as people  bought Patanjalis cheaper variety.The Burmans realized that Dabur needs to get back to basics and return to its coreAyurveda.The future, says Dabur India chief executive officer (CEO) Sunil Duggal, will be driven by Ayurvedic products. With this validation (success of Patanjali), we are more committed to staying and growing the natural equities and not string into other domains. So it provides a lot more focus to the companys activities and a lot more opportunities to grow within spaces that we are familiar with rather than to get into unfamiliar spaces which obviously would be much riskier, he adds.There were reasons why Dabur was unsure about sticking to only Ayurvedic products.The Burmans wanted to build an empire outside Indiaacross the Middle East, Africa, Europe, North America and South Asia, which together accounts for 32% of Daburs consolidated sales at present. Across all these countries, Ayurveda was never a popular or saleable concept. So the shift was only  natural.Although Dabur was probably the only Indian company that was selling products made of Ayurvedic formulations nationwide, it was unsure about how far it could take Ayurveda. Till recently, the ability of Ayurvedic products to go deeper was under some question. Ayurveda can go deep in certain areas, not all. Like skin care, it may not go that deep. But we are now beginning to question that paradigm. Now we are far more convinced that Ayurveda can go far deeper in many areas than what we thought earlier, says Duggal.Faith vs evidence A couple of months ago, the company revamped its marketing communications with a new taglineScience-based Ayurveda. So far, it was celebrate life. All our advertisements and other communications are now based on one themeScience of Ayurveda. There have been changes in packaging and marketing communications as well. We need to be relevant to the youth, says K.K. Chutani, executive director (marketing) at Dabur India. Besides, in February this year it tied up with e-commerce marketplace Snapdeal to set up an e-store for its Ayurveda products called LiveVEDA. Chutani believes, e-commerce was an imperative for Daburs future.The rationale behind Daburs new communication is its history. The Burmans have been marketing Ayurveda for more than 130 years. But it cant just bank on its history or legacy. The platform that we are going to leverage is the science-based Ayurveda, backed by research, validation and hard evidences. It will appeal to a lot of people who may not believe in faith-based Ayurveda (unlike Ramdevs followers), adds Chutani. Emergence of Patanjali, believes CEO Duggal, is a blessing in disguise for Dabur. Patanjali products are sold primarily based on peoples faith in Ramdev. His marketing and Patanjalis well-spread retail presence has already, and probably would, convert a lot of non-Ayurdevic product users into regular users of Ayurvedic or herbal products. There has been some learning from Ramdev. To my mind, he has given a big impetus to Ayurveda and his large number of followers are driving it. The desire for Ayurvedic solutions runs very deep in Indian psychology. It would be very silly of us not to take advantage of that, says Duggal, who joined Dabur in 1995 and became CEO in 2002.By 2020, Dabur targets Ayurvedic products to constitute more than 75% of its sales in India, from around 60% now.To focus more on Ayurvedic formulations, the company is doubling its herb cultivation. By March 2017, Dabur will have 3,800 acres for medicinal herb farming, up from about 2,000 acres at present that it has developed during past two decades. It also has a greenhouse at Pantnagar in Uttarakhand. The company will be spending Rs600 crore in back-end supply chain. The medicinal farming will be spread across eight states in India and Nepal, and engage about 2,500 farmers, up from 1,200 at present.We have been marrying the age-old Ayurvedic heritage and traditions with cutting-edge scientific prowess. We have a strong in-house research wing that follows a bush-to-brand approach. We have our in-house nursery, which grows several rare herbs that go into various products. Dabur is probably the only company which is involved in both classical or ethical as well as OTC (over-the-counter) formulation research for close to 40 years now, says J.L.N. Sastry, head (research and development, Ayurveda) at Dabur India. In a note on 21 September, Citi Research, a division of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., said, Dabur claims to focus on science-based high quality Ayurveda products with an emphasis on R&D, which makes it well positioned to ride this wave.Countering PatanjaliIn May, Dabur launched an advertisement for its honey which said it was approved by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) that ensures safety. Patanjalis honey does not have FSSAI approval. The ad came on the back of a drop in sales of Dabur honey at the beginning of the year. The company has been selling honey since 1994  and dominates the market with close to a two-thirds share.However, Patanjali honey directly hit Dabur primarily because of the price difference. Daburs honey was priced about 40% higher than Patanjalis. We got things corrected through offers and other things. We find people who switched are returning. But there is a section of people, financially stressed, who may not come back. But we have to deal with that. We cant have all things for all people, says Duggal. The company also launched brand extensions like honey fruit spreads.Interestingly, in an earlier Mint interview, Ramdev said his rivalry was with multinational companies (MNCs) not the home-grown ones like Dabur. But a Patanjali spokesperson said that even if Dabur is an Indian company, it has no right to loot people. Products are overpriced. Be it an Indian company or MNC, it should operate ethically, and products should be economical. With Patanjali, backed by Baba Ramdevs marketing, the market for Ayurvedic and herbal or natural products has expanded, which certainly is an opportunity for everyone, he added.Commenting on FSSAI certification, or the lack of it, the spokesperson said that Patanjalis honey had passed all required tests and is safe. As honey is a products that is consumed both as a medicine and a food item, FSSAI approval is not mandatory, he added.Besides honey, even Daburs toothpaste sales were impacted but Duggal dismisses concerns about it by saying the category has not been growing. In fact, Dabur Chyawanprash, the market leader with an estimated 65% share, also faced stiff competition after Patanjali started mass marketing Chyawanprash at a much lower price last year. But its impact was not severe, maintains Duggal.However, Dabur narrowed the price gap with Patanjali and tried establishing Chyawanprash, a predominantly winter product, as a product relevant for others seasons like monsoon through intense promotional activities. With Patanjali coming in, the category might grow better. He (Ramdev) will convert a lot of non-users into Chyawanprash users. He could be a good ambassador for Chyawanprash, adds Duggal.In a note on 21 September, Citi Research  said, Dabur has been managing competitive intensity well through brand building (strong digital push), value-added variants or formats and by reducing price premiums in segments like honey with price-offs and promotions... Reducing the pricing premium with extra weight (such as 1.25 kg for the price of 1 kg) and / or price-offs, upping the ante on honey brand building and the extension to value-added variants and formats are examples of a well-rounded approach to tackle the aggressive competition from Patanjali.Daburs challenge, according to Sunita Sachdev, an analyst with UBS Securities India Pvt. Ltd, is to re-invent its brand and make itself relevant to the current crop of consumers. Getting back to its rootsAyurvedais very appropriate, said Sachdev.Peer pressureDabur India isnt under pressure from Patanjali alone. Competition in the domestic market in the last few years has increased as almost every packaged goods companyhome-grown and multinationalhas rolled out products that are herbal or natural. The trend has been triggered largely by Patanjalis success and the opportunity the category offers for premiumization of products.In recent years, HUL and Colgate, local units of MNCs, have ramped up their portfolios with premium Ayurvedic products in key brands. Home-grown Emami Ltd and Himalaya Drug Co., which have been selling herbal or Ayurvedic products for long, have gained from their traditional herbal positioning. These companies are extending brands into new and emerging segments to improve profitability. And all of them are trying to expand. While Emami bought Ayurvedic hair oil and shampoo brand Kesh King from SBS Biotech Ltd in June 2015 for Rs1,651 crore, HUL acquired Kerala-based Indulekha hair oil brand for Rs330 crore earlier this year to boost its presence in Ayurvedic space.Interestingly, Dabur was the first to tap the hair oil space with a herbal product Dabur Amla hair oil back in 1940 and expanded its hair care portfolio in early 1990s with Vatika brand. But it failed to leverage the advantage of an early entrant.Admits Duggal, We never thought products like shampoo can be marketed as an Ayurvedic product. With recent developments in the market, we are now thinking of launching Ayurvedic shampoo. Some of our bets will work, some may not. But Ayurveda can go beyond the imagination of people.Herbal or Ayurvedic still constitutes a very small part of personal care market in India. According to a research report (September 2015) by UBS Securities India, herbal products comprise 6-7% of the personal care products market, but the volume is growing at about twice the segment average. The report estimated herbal to grow to about 10% of the segment by FY20 as the trend accelerates.Duggal, however, believes Dabur has the advantage of being a company that has been the original marketer of Ayurveda in India. There are differences between Ayurveda and herbal. Herbal is a step before Ayurveda. Ayurveda is a completely different ball game, he adds.Distressed economyBesides increasing competition, slow growth is a serious worry for Dabur too.In April-June 2016 quarter, the companys sales grew just 1.2%. In the quarter ended March 2016, it reported a 4% increase in volume in the domestic market compared to a 7% growth in the preceding quarter. Post results, the management had painted a cautious outlook for FY17. It expects things to get better only in the second half of FY17. The key challenge that we are facing today is that theres a radical downward shift in the overall consumption of consumer goods because of tapering of the stimulus that was provided by the earlier government and has not been taken forward by the current government. The current government is following an investment-led growth and not consumption-led growth that has triggered a consumption stress, primarily in rural market, which was the prime driver of growth between 2008 and 2014, says Duggal.A double-digit growth is very unlikely in the next one-two years for the packaged consumer goods firms. I am hoping for 6-8%. I never expected this sharp a decline in consumption. I knew it will come down but not from 12% to 3-4%, says Duggal, adding that consumption will improve in  a gradual manner starting 2018.Two consecutive poor monsoons also hurt consumption. A relatively good monsoon, coupled with the seventh pay commission money in the system, is likely to provide some impetus that would help consumption recover. However, the picture is not that dismal as packaged goods companies like Dabur are enjoying high marginsthanks to stability in commodity prices resulting in low input costs. Its a good thing. But the downside of the combination of high margin and low demand will typically lead to a lot of pricing activities. Reduction of prices in some cases and aggressive promotions are obvious. Well have to deal with that aspect. Some of the margins may be passed on to the consumers, adds Duggal.Rewriting ruralAbout 45% of Dabur Indias domestic revenue comes from rural markets and, as mentioned above, consumption in rural markets has not been growing for the last few years. Naturally, the company not only stopped expanding its distribution network in rural areas, in the last one year it also stepped out of certain markets to minimize its risk.Thats not all. It also reorganized its sales force in rural markets. The company hired about 1,000 people to sell its products in villages starting this April. Earlier, village sales representatives were under the payrolls of third-party human resource companies. Dabur is shelling out the same amount of money but the village sales representatives are earning more as their salaries are not being shared by third-party firms. They are the sons of the soil. They understand these markets. With them coming on our rolls, productivity and sales have improved. Rural markets will start growing again. Well ramp up distribution and marketing to capture the growth prospects thats expected in the second half of the year, adds Duggal. Dabur typically pays Rs2 lakh a year and incentives to the village sales representatives.Tweaks in distribution and go-to-market efforts, according to the Citi Research note, will help Dabur improve productivity of the enhanced footprint, besides doctor detailing could be a key driver for healthcare offerings.For urban markets, the company, in June, divided its portfolio in four pieces home and personal care, healthcare, OTC medicines, and food and beverages. Theres a separate sales team for each of these segments. Earlier there were three segmentsOTC, FMCG and food. The change is aimed at bringing a deeper focus on individual segments.Dabur products now reach around 5.3 million outlets. In comparison, HUL reaches about 6.3 million of the estimated 8 million retail outlets in India. Cigarette-to-shampoo maker ITC Ltd reaches to around 4.3 million retail stores.Advantage spreadDabur has a unique mix of diverse growth enginesjuices, healthcare, skincare, international business and home care. And, it has four cash cowshair oils, digestives, health supplements and toothpastes. The growth engines, noted Morgan Stanley in a report, can use cash cows to generate consistent, superior growth. Dabur has the ability to launch highly differentiated product offerings across its product portfolio, catalyzed by the recent success of Patanjali, increase in disposable incomes, lifestyle changes and increasing awareness of Ayurvedic products, it report added.OTC products are seen as the most exciting growth opportunity for Dabur, backed by the companys brand strength, knowledge of Ayurveda, doctor advocacy, and product heritage. We expect a slew of launches over the next few quarters with a focus on daily healthcare and lifestyle ailments. This business also has one of the best gross profit margin profiles. We believe growth will inflect as consumers perceive these products as being efficacious for overall health and wellness and likely balance out the adverse impact of rapid changes in lifestyles currently under way, said the Morgan Stanley analysis.Eyes on buysAcquisition was one of the routes that helped Dabur grow, mainly in markets outside India. The company, which has more than Rs2,200 crore of cash on its balance sheet, is now looking for buyouts in India to ensure faster growth. In the last few years, organic growth has been slow and Dabur has not made a pitch to acquire any firm. The companys deals team is already working on a few targets. Despite the fact that the management is open to spending about Rs1,000 crore on acquisitions, Dabur is only looking for small buys. I like small brands that are scalable, primarily regional brands with national relevance. I hope to close at least one deal by end of this financial year, says Duggal.Dabur is looking at Ayurvedic brands and brands in the adjacent areas. It is unlikely to buy any company that is in the generic products space as that could conflict with its existing product offering. There are a few generic products, but buying a generic product maker would be replication. Thats one of the reasons why we did not buy Zandu (which got sold to Emami in 2008), he adds.Likely acquisition targets could be companies that make branded proprietary products in areas such as digestion, cough and cold, fever, lifestyle disease management, among others. However, there are not many targets in the market.Acquisitions make sense. Despite high valuations, Emamis acquisition of Kesh King and HULs Indulekha buyout were relatively successful, says Sachdev of UBS Securities.Its key acquisitions in India include Balsara Hygiene Products Ltd, maker of Babool toothpaste and Odonil air freshner, in 2005 and female skin care products maker Fem Care Pharma in 2008. Over the years, some of the brands it acquired from these two firms, such as Fem, Babool and Odonil, have crossed the Rs100-crore sales mark. Even its international business has primarily grown through acquisitions post- 2010. International woes About 32% of Daburs consolidated revenue comes from international markets by selling personal care products across the Middle East, Africa, Europe, North America and South Asia. The Middle East is the biggest market that accounts for 33% of the companys international sales, followed by Africa (22%), Americas (17%), Asian markets excluding India (17%) and Europe (11%).But companies, including Dabur, have been facing challenges in these markets mainly due to political uncertainties, currency fluctuations and falling oil prices. Low oil prices have led to a downward pressure on oil producing economies with governments adopting austerity measures, curbing spending on major projects and reducing subsidies which has eroded disposable incomes. Most of the markets have witnessed sharp depreciation in their currencies which has led to lower value realizations in our business. Geo-political turmoil in MENA (Middle East and North Africa) has, to a large extent, impacted markets such as Syria, Libya, Yemen, Iraq and others where there has been a reduction in consumption due to large scale displacement of human population, says Mohit Malhotra, CEO of Dabur International Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dabur India.Dabur, however, will continue to invest in these marketsin brands, distribution and building local supply chains to ensure better pricing and margin.Also see | Our aim is to make Dabur a multinational from India: Amit BurmanIn July, Dabur India acquired Discaria Trading, registered in South Africa, for just Rs4,679 (1,000 South African rand). It was a small but important acquisition. With this, the company got an entry to South Africaa market it has been trying enter for a long time. Dabur already has two manufacturing plantsone each in Nigeria and Egypt.Africa has been on the radar of Indian packaged goods and personal care firms for the past few years primarily because of projected consumer spending. Consulting firm McKinsey and Co., in a report in 2010, projected consumer spending in Africa to double to $1.8 trillion by 2020. Dabur made its first foreign acquisition in 2010 by buying Hobi Kozmetik Group, a leading personal care products company in Turkey, for $69 million. It also acquired US-based Namaste Laboratories for $100 million in the same year. Our twin acquisitions took place almost a decade after our entry into the overseas markets and these acquisitions have helped us further consolidate our overseas business. We have emerged as the Indian-born FMCG transnational entirely through the organic route, says Malhotra. Prior to these acquisitions, the company primarily sold hair oil under Dabur Amla and Vatika brands in the overseas markets. Now, its international portfolio is dominated by products it got from acquisitions. According to Citi Research, hair oil accounted for about 39% of sales from international markets together, followed by shampoo (14%), hair cream (13%), oral care (11%), skin care (7%) and styling products (about 12%) in FY16, contrary to hair oil contributing about 93% to the business in FY06.Namaste business has been steady and we believe local manufacturing and distribution in Africa should provide a fillip to the business from 2017 onwards. Local manufacturing would enhance the price competitiveness of Namaste products that are currently imported and thus at a significant price premium. Steps to enhancing sales and distribution for Namaste products in sub-Saharan Africa should help Dabur deepen its presence. For the other overseas operations, management talks of a somewhat lower adverse forex impact vs the previous year. Geopolitical or economic issues in Saudi Arabia and parts of North Africa remain, but the companys foray into Iran could be a new positive driver from second half of FY17, Citi Research said in the 21 September report.Going forward, Dabur will deepen presence in many of the countries in Africa, primarily where it already has presence, and across markets in South Asia. Two markets where it sees a better future are Myanmar and Iran. The company already has a presence in Myanmar, and it is setting up a factory in Iranprobably the last big market thats left unexplored due to blockadeto start selling products early next year.We are open to exploring inorganic opportunities to fill gaps in our existing portfolio and geographic presence, says Malhotra, adding that the company has not earmarked any amount for buys and can fund acquisitions through internal accruals and debt. Sachdev of UBS Securities, however, says there is risk in the international business. Theres also sub-scale which hinders their ability to generate quicker higher returns, she adds.Analysts darlingCompetition may be stiff and growth may be slow but Dabur India is considered an attractive investment proposition in consumer staples by equity analysts.Over FY16-18, noted Morgan Stanley in its report on 25 April, Dabur will become the most expensive staples stock from one of the cheapest now. It added, Even as the stock has outperformed the Sensex by 6% over the past six months, it has underperformed peers like Godrej Consumer Products Ltd, HUL and Marico Ltd by 10-30% on concerns of rising competition, especially from Patanjali Ayurved.Brokerage firm CLSA, in a report on 29 April, noted that the Dabur stock was up 11% in the past three months and it will continue to outperform as growth visibility is improving.",2016-10-23,UgUhTXwedPBnKgK0sgqIiO,"Feeling the heat from Baba Ramdevs Patanjali Ayurved, Dabur returns to its roots: Ayurveda ",23:42,Dabur goes back to basics to take on Patanjali

However, the Burman family member currently spends about a third of his time on Dabur even as he steers Lite Bite Foods Pvt. Ltd, a company that runs restaurants chains in India and abroad. The 47-year-old licensed pilot is unruffled by the much-talked-about emergence of Patanjali as a competitor to Dabur. Burman says his focus is to build Dabur as the multinational from India. Edited excerpts:
How big a threat is Patanjali?Besides that fact that you cant fight faith in India, I see Patanjali as an opportunity builder rather than a threat. Ramdev and Patanjali have expanded the market, turned a lot of non-users to users of Ayurvedic products. We have been selling Ayurvedic and natural products for more than 130 years. Our products are based on scientific research based on old Ayurvedic knowledge. We have the advantage. With time, more people will turn to science-based Ayurveda from faith-based Ayurveda. Innovation and efficient communication will definitely help us in staying ahead in the curve.But it has impacted Dabur. Except honey, there has not been much impact. We have taken some steps to address this, and sales of honey have already picked up. Overall growth, primarily in the past couple of quarters, was impacted due to many reasons, such as slowdown in rural markets.With the good monsoon, coupled with government initiatives, things should get better in the coming quarters.At Dabur, I involve in strategy, and expansion in new markets. Our aim is to make Dabur a multinational from India. Thats the long-term goal we have been working on.What are the things you would like to change if you were to run Dabur?Hunger for acquisitions should grow. Theres a limit on how much you can grow organically. Mergers and acquisitions are the route for faster growth. But that does not mean you can go for overpriced buys. The focus on international markets should increase. Markets outside of India should contribute more to overall sales. The third thing is the focus should be on healthcare. This is one area that would be very big in future. Everything, even food, should have a health focus. These are not new areas but enhanced focus on these will ensure faster growth.Market analysts have indicated a potential change in management. Will there be more involvement of the family in Daburs day-to-day operations?No. There is no plan of changing the management.

307,0.248775,"Wipro Ltd reported another quarter of sluggish revenue growth; in constant currency terms, revenue grew just 0.9% in the September quarter. Besides, it has guided for growth of only 0-2% in the December quarter.
				   
				But investors have got used to sub-par growth rates from the company. Whats unusual is the aggression it has shown lately in trying to get out of this low-growth rut.On Thursday, Wipro announced the acquisition of Appirio Inc., a US-based cloud services firm for $500 million. The firm has annual revenue of less than $200 million, implying a pricey tag of around 2.5 times revenue. Note that such firms typically operate with single-digit operating margins, which means the price-earnings valuation of the asset may be as high as 50-70 times.Analysts are convinced the deal will be earnings dilutive in the near term. But they are also excited about the companys prospects. Appirio is one of the largest independent cloud services implementation partner for SaaS (software as a service) vendors such as Salesforce and Workday. Wipro  also gets access to one of the largest crowdsourcing communities called Topcoder. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients, The acquisition leapfrogs Wipro in Salesforce and Workday implementation over other Indian IT (firms) and places it among the top-5 players globally along with IBM, Accenture and Deloitte. Besides, they said the deal would enhance Wipros ability to take this capability to its existing large clients; improves its digital positioning and also open up opportunities for integrated deals as opposed to simple reliance on implementation revenue.While Wipro is already present in this segment, revenue from the practice stood at just $40 million. Analysts at Nomura said the acquisition will put Wipro ahead of its Indian IT peers, besides helping the company transition well in the ongoing shift from on-premise software to SaaS.On 11 February, Wipro announced the $460 million acquisition of HealthPlan Services, a leading business process as a service (BPaaS) provider in the US health insurance market. It had also closed in on another BPaaS provider, Viteos, although the deal was called off after it took too long to close. Kotaks analysts point out that the company is also actively engaged in in-house development of BPaaS solutions, and has been investing in platforms and intellectual property. Wipro is playing quick catch up after initial lag in digital with clear identifiable bets. Some of the acquisitions will hurt the P&L (profit and loss) and lead to dilution of earnings. Wipro is willing to take the hit in order to create a more sustainable growth engine and business model, the analysts said in the note.Peers have been relatively cautious and have lagged in terms of investments in emerging technology and solutions. As a result, their growth, too, has slowed, while competitors such as Accenture Plc have done far better, thanks to numerous acquisitions in recent years.Of course, the Streets response to Wipros deals has been a bit restrained. The companys shares have underperformed again this year. One reason is investors tend to be myopic and focus on short-term performance. The other is that Wipro, like most Indian IT firms, doesnt have a great track record of integrating acquisitions well. According to analysts at JPMorgan India Pvt. Ltd, Infocrossing, the companys last large acquisition, had not helped Wipro consolidate its then-leadership position in IT infrastructure-management. It was acquired for $600 million in August 2007. If anything, they add, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd took over leadership in infra-management despite Wipros large acquisition.But clearly, Wipro cant be faulted for not trying. Investors will hope that it keeps its eye on the ball and works on integration issues in its attempt to regain industry-leading growth.Investors can also take comfort from the increasing return ratios. Wipro has increased its payout ratio to 48% in fiscal 2016, from 41% in FY15 and 30% in the preceding four years.Whether the companys bets in the SaaS and BPaaS space work out well or not, investors should be pleased that Wipro is at least choosing not to sit on a pile of cash that earns poor returns.",2016-10-23,er5KBSodjk95kttSnsjrNO,"Whether Wipro bets in SaaS and BPaaS space work out well or not, investors should be pleased it is at least choosing not to sit on a pile of cash that earns poor returns",23:47,Is Wipro showing IT industry how to use its cash?
397,0.249725,"Bengaluru: Wipro chief executive officer Abidali Neemuchwala, who is based out of Dallas, US, could not fly down to Bengaluru when the company declared its second- quarter earnings last week because of a prior engagement. 
				   
				However, in a telephone interview with Mint, Neemuchwala said that Wipro is well-positioned and on its way to make itself a future-ready firm. The former Tata Consultancy Services Ltd veteran, who joined the company in April 2015 as the chief operating officer and took over as the CEO in February this year, has taken steps to improve Wipros delivery and sales capabilities. Edited excerpts: Due to slow growth and declining profitability, and the way technology is changing, many commentators and analysts have questioned the Indian IT outsourcing industry and are pronouncing the death of Indian IT. What are your thoughts? I would not agree with the death of Indian IT. Indian IT has always had the resilience or ability to transform itself. It has the flexibility, the nimble-footedness. One of our industrys core competencies has been our ability to train a large number of people. Now is the market changing? The answer is definitely yes. So what has made us successful in the pastis that going to make us successful in the future? The answer is certainly no. Will change be required? The answer is yes. Will Wipro be able to undergo that change? Absolutely yes. I am absolutely confident. Are we well-positioned as a company? The answer is yes. This is because I have always believed Wipro as a company is entrepreneurial. We are also very technology-centric. We have made investments in digital technologies, like Internet of Things and cloud. We are making the organisation simple and nimble-footed. We are democratising the operating structure where every single unit can run with that. We started hyper automation and now we are ahead of our plan. So going forward times for Wipro will be better than in the past and I wouldnt call it a doomsday scenario.Its now been over eight months and two full quarters with you as CEO. What has been, say, two heartening features for you as the boss and issues which have disappointed you, which you believe could have made your company do better?Two most heartening things which I have seen in the eight months are that our strategy and ambition resonates and percolates to employees and customers. This is very important for any CEO. Simply, because no single CEO can do magic in a company unless the CEO has the power of the organisation. And at the same time making employees believe that their future is tied to the future of the company. I am very glad that we have been able to do this and that is a very heartening thing for me. We had a very stable CEO transition (on 1 February Neemuchwala was appointed as CEO and his predecessor T.K. Kurien was appointed executive vice-chairman). We have a very stable top management team. The kind of changes we wanted to do at the top, we have been able to do without losing the senior leadership talent pool. The second thing is that as we started articulating our strategy, our customers are lapping up to this strategy. The newly-acquired and newly-built capabilities like Wipro Digital or Wipro Consulting or our hyper automation journey combined with Wipro Holmes, or our investments through Wipro ventures... we are able to take these capabilities to each one of our customers. On the other hand, the speed of change which is required and the speed of change a knowledge-based organisation can undergo is something which I would be happier if we could do it faster. Yes, we are an over 170,000-people-strong company. But the pace of change, the training, the way we are changing our processes, all of it I wish I could get done faster. Its not to say Im dissatisfied with the pace but it would be heartening if we could bring this change faster than what we are doing.Two-full quarters as CEO, and you have embarked on a journey by articulating six broad themes. Given these measures you have started, the management has said in the past that a complete turnaround will take time. Will it be fair to ask if the company can come back or say end March 2018 with industry-matching growth or Nasscom-projected growth numbers?Im always careful of putting a timeline and so I believe it is not unreasonable to expect this (by coming to industry-matching growth number by March 2018). I feel very confident and I see green shoots coming in a more sustainable manner. Im very hopeful that four-five quarters is a good time for a very visible outcome or metric for an industry-leading growth or margin.One of the things which is of concern now for many is that despite making three buyouts, with a combined revenue of $340 million, in the last financial year, and this fourth buyout of Appirio, Wipro is not able to record impressive growth. So on the merger and acquisition (M&A) front, how are you going to make sure Wipro is able to integrate buyouts well and scale up business?I think there are two parts. First is having a bold and risk taking ability to buy. And second is staying the course and making these acquisitions successful. We have shown that we certainly have the former. Now, its time to focus on the latter. So take for example, our acquisition of DesignIt (Wipro Ltd acquired Denmark-based DesignIt for $95 million in July last year). When we acquired it, we had 300 designers. Now we have 450 designers. That company on its own has never seen that kind of explosive growth. I feel very confident that we have the right balance where we dont give our buyouts such a tight embrace that we squeeze the company. We keep these buyouts in our shadow but not alone. I believe we have learnt from our past mistakes. Now HealthPlan Services (Wipro spent $460 million to buy HealthPlan Services in February this year) is a recent buyout but I do see very early synergy wins there. Although right now because of US elections and some issues in the Healthcare Payer market, there is a level of uncertainty. Cellent (Wipro paid $78 million in December last year to buy German firm Cellent) is taking a bit longer than the other two but that is because of cultural issues. Also, Im very focused that every business unit should not have more than one acquisition to integrate and digest. So Cellent is under manufacturing and Continental Europe. Appirio will sit with business applications. DesignIt sits with digital.These four buyouts bring over $550 million in revenue. So clearly M&A is going to play a big part of your ambitious target of becoming a $20 billion firm by 2020. What percentage of revenue do you expect to generate from M&A?We dont break out organic or inorganic revenue growth because it can be a bit misleading. But directionally, I can tell you that M&A will not be insignificant. It will be substantial and not small. The ticket size you are seeing is already bold from the Indian IT perspective. But we will not acquire to buy revenue or scale.",2016-10-24,u0swvRQUwz7X2V8n7hWWYN,"Indias IT sector has always had the resilience or ability to transform itself, says Abidali Neemuchwala ",10:45,IT sector not looking at doomsday scenario: Wipro CEO Abidali Neemuchwala

				The board of the group holding company did not specify a reason for the abrupt move, which was announced after markets closed.Tata Sons in its collective wisdom and on the recommendations of the principal shareholders decided that it may be appropriate to consider a change for the long-term interest of Tata Sons and Tata group, a spokesperson said. A selection committee comprising Ratan Tata, Venu Srinivasan, Amit Chandra, Ronen Sen and Kumar Bhattacharyya was given the mandate of finding a replacement for Mistry, 48, who became chairman of the $103 billion conglomerate in December 2012, at the end of Tatas over two-decade tenure at the top. The board was given four months to complete the task. In the interim, the board has requested me to perform the role of chairman and I have agreed to do so in the interest of and reassurance to the Tata group, Ratan Tata, 78, said in a statement addressed to colleagues.ALSO READ | Uneasy lies the Tata crownThe development, which portends at least short-term turmoil, comes at a time when the conglomerate, whose business interests range from tea to telecom and salt to software services, has been trying to recast or dispose of the key UK steel business, which it acquired in a $12.9 billion purchase of Corus Group Plc. in 2007 under Ratan Tata.This is quite an unusual situation, unexpected from a group like Tata which stands for its values. This means there could possibly have been some governance issue or some major disagreement with either the style of functioning or decision that Mistry may have taken, said Kavil Ramachandran, professor and executive director at the Thomas Schmidheiny Centre for Family Enterprise at the Indian School of Business.According to a person aware of the development, the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, of which Mistry is a scion and which is estimated to hold an 18% stake in Tata Sons, is protesting the move, paving the ground for what could be a messy battle. About two-thirds of Tata Sons is held by philanthropic trusts such as the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Mistry will continue as a Tata Sons director, the spokesperson cited earlier said. However, the group executive council (GEC), a brainchild of Mistrys, has been disbanded, said a person aware of the development. The GEC page has been pulled down from Tata Sons website as has Mistrys September interview to the in-house magazine in which he stated his views on some of the underperforming companies in the group. Our individual companies need to earn the right to grow, he said in the interview.The boardroom putsch has been some time in the making, according to a person close to Mistry, who asked not to be identified. Differences have surfaced over how Mistry has been dealing with the significant challenges facing the group.Several of Mistrys operational decisions were challenged by Ratan Tata, according to this person. Still, it is the prerogative of the largest shareholder to do this, the person said a few weeks ago. Mint couldnt ascertain if there was an immediate trigger for this ouster.Primarily, it was a lack of communication between the shareholder and the management. A lot of decision-making was done unilaterally by Tata Sons and was not approved by Tata Trusts, said another person briefed about the matter.Among the six chairmen Tata Sons has had so far in its history, Mistrys is the shortest tenure at just short of four years.ALSO READ | Ratan Tata says intolerance a curse we are seeing of lateSince taking over, Mistry has repeatedly talked about continuing to seize business opportunities, especially in emerging technologies.

435,0.24975,"India remains attractive for foreign investors despite the imminent interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve and UKs decision to leave the European Union, John Woods, chief investment officer for Asia-Pacific at Credit Suisse Private Banking, said in an interview. Edited excerpts:
				   
				In January, you had written that you are neutral about India as the growth and reform potentials are still suppressed by political factors. Has your view changed since then? We are cautiously constructive on India from a fundamental perspective. We know it is one of the fastest growing economies among the major economies. We are positive about its valuations. We think capital inflows into India is likely to accelerate as the focus on emerging markets continues. Thats why we are overweight on India within our asset allocation for the Asia-Pacific region and just recently turned overweight on China as well. We are recommending these two markets to our clients.Some people say the Indian equity market is overvalued.We were looking at the price earnings ratio for the next year, which is at around 16 times. For us, that is not particularly expensive. It is not particularly cheap either. It is fairly priced. The problem seems to be consumer-related stocks are quite expensive and capital consumption stocks are quite cheap. What we would like to see certainly is greater evidence of growth in the manufacturing and industrial sector, greater evidence of capital expenditure and therefore profitability growth. That would paint a more balanced picture of the choices open to investors.What are your growth projections for India?We are looking at GDP growth of 7.8% and 8% for next year. We expect the Sensex to close this year at around 28,500. We got a pretty positive outlook for next year. We are looking at 30,500, equivalent of 10% growth from current level, which would be a record high for the Sensex. We are absolutely positive on the equity story.What makes you so bullish about India?It is the fundamental story relative to the rest of Asia that is actually quite attractive. It has a growth rate most economies will die for. It has quite a positive story on consumer spending, which pretty much the rest of Asia is also seeking to expand as well. The reality is we have a positive forecast for a large number of countries in Asia because we think the emerging markets will continue to benefit from the inflows from developed markets. We have seen evidence of some of those inflows already. 2016 has been a great year for a number of emerging markets, particularly based in Asia. Our forecast is a combination of our views on dollar, on commodity prices, on interest rates and domestic factors as well.So, how will a US Fed interest rate hike change those assumptions?We think the Fed will hike interest rate in December, but we only anticipate one or two hikes next year. In other words, it is going to be a very shallow trajectory. That is pretty positive for emerging markets. It means dollar is likely to stay soft, liquidity continues to seek yield and carry. They will continue to be attracted towards economies like India, which offers both yield and carry. In May 2013, we saw the taper tantrum and we saw foreign investors attack India because it had quite unmarked external imbalance in terms of its current account deficit. Thats corrected quite dramatically since then. Foreign exchange reserves have improved quite substantially since then. The economy itself has got a much better reputation among foreign investors due to the liberalization programme.But what are the risks for emerging markets like India?The risks are focused on unexpected spike in inflation in the US because of rise in commodity prices. Then we have to start repricing the Fed, the US dollar, the term structure of bond yields and that would have quite profound effect because then the US will become the yield and carry story and all the money that were seeking carry and yield in emerging markets will go back. But the important point is we are seeing an end to deflation. The last two years or so, the global economy was hammered by deflation. Chinas latest PPI (producers price index) was for the first time positive in five years. As you know people have been accusing China of exporting deflation to the global economy, that has now ended. So we are seeing more signs of positive inflation, which leads to positive sales growth, improved profitability, improved earnings and a healthier stock market. Thats the kind of virtuous cycle that shapes emerging markets such as India.But do you think Brexit has been priced in completely by the investors?The positive effect of Brexit has certainly been priced in. As you know there were a lot of dooms day predictors. They have been proven wrong. Unemployment is now extremely low, the PMIs (purchasing price indices) are extremely high, the stock exchange is getting higher and higher, sterling itself is a great shock absorber. The UK has one of the highest current account deficits among the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries and 20-30% correction in sterling is a very good way of correcting that imbalance. The medium term implications of Brexit are uncertain. But the UK has a huge trade deficit with the EU. So I cant see it necessarily why it is in the EUs interest to burn its bridges with one of its important markets in the world. So I do think there will be mutually beneficial agreement ultimately because both parties want access to each others markets.The government is exploring ways to deal with the bad loans in public sector banks. Do you think a bad bank will be an effective tool in Indian context?In principle, recapitalizing the banking system through the vehicle of bad bank makes perfect sense. If your banking system is unable to extend credit because it is too focused on repairing its capital adequacy and provisioning for its non-performing loans, then how will the economy grow? How can credit be extended particularly to the manufacturing sector and it is one of the problems facing India right now. So the idea to create a vehicle to recapitalize the financial sector by taking out the impaired assets and thereby improving the quality of the balance sheet clearly is a very good idea. The devil always is in the detail. How do you actually do that? Who takes the hit? Should shareholders pay up or should the government pay up? In China, for example, that was originally done at face value.Do you agree with the IMF assessment that credit is growing at a dangerous pace in China and its economy risks an eventual disruptive adjustment?We dont think there will be a credit event in China over the next year because there is an extremely important national Peoples party congress in October 2017 and it is our view that until that meeting happens, the government will continue to provide support and cushion any downturn in economic growth. We have in fact upgraded Chinas economic growth to 6.5% this year and 6.3% in 2017 (from 6% earlier). So not only do we not see a hard-landing, we actually see some evidence of economic acceleration vis-à-vis our previous forecast.10-India has proposed a BRICS credit rating agency as it thinks the current rating system is quite biased against developing countries. Do you agree? Do you see scope for another rating agency?I think it is a fantastic idea. Any effort to provide independent, impartial view of an operating environment through the rating of individual companies can only increase transparency of a business environment. The problem that comes up is how impartial this rating will be? Can I trust the quality of the rating and that clearly has to take time. Initially, there will be some caution and wait and see attitude among investors whether the quality of this credit analysis replicates other rating agencies. But the big problem that I see is when you have a niche rating agency, foreign investors are unable to make a rating assessment at a global level based on a consistent set of rating methodology.",2016-10-25,y93PTvzUvdnZZYE9ZPmK4L,"Capital inflows into India likely to accelerate as focus on emerging markets continues, says Credit Suisses John Woods",01:27,"Sensex could touch  30,500 points in 2017: John Woods"

25,-0.139025,"Last month, The Economist published a story on the Tata group with the title Mistrys Elephant, where the magazine compared the conglomerate to a ponderous pachyderm.
				   
				In what now appears to be a remarkably prescient remark, the magazine said, That the revered Mr (Ratan) Tata still chairs the Trusts that bear his name may make it trickier for Mr (Cyrus) Mistry to be his own man.Was Mistrys performance so bad that he had to be removed? The Street seems to think otherwise.One obvious yardstick is the market capitalization of the group. On 1 January 2013, soon after Mistry took charge, the market capitalization of listed companies of the Tata group was Rs4.97 trillion. On Monday, when the decision was announced, the market capitalization stood at Rs8.71 trilliona massive 75% higher in less than four years.The Tata groups increase in market capitalization beats benchmarks such as the Nifty, which has risen 47% and big groups such as Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) with a market capitalization growth of 27% in the same period. Of course, one cannot ignore the market cap of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), one of the groups premium firms that spews  cash, alone is higher than that of RIL. And it does paper over the fact that many of the group companies are not doing so well. But, on key return ratios such as return on equity, the groups leading firms are on par with peers. As far as revenue goes, compounded revenue growth between FY13 and FY16 of TCS, Tata Motors Ltd (led by Jaguar Land Rover Plc) and even Indian Hotels Corp. Ltd have outperformed their peers.ALSO READ | Cyrus Mistry removed as Tata Sons chairman, Ratan Tata returnsYes, there were some bad eggs in the basket. For instance, Tata Steel Ltds acquisition of European steel giant Corus was sinking under its own weight. But its performance has perhaps more to do with the severe cyclical downturn in commodities, with global players bleeding and shutting down plants.Tata Docomo likewise was caught in a long-drawn and bitter legal tussle, the genesis of which predated Mistrys taking charge.If anything, media reports suggest Mistry was trying to put the vast and diversified conglomerate in order. He put Coruss steel assets in the UK on the block and took firm steps to sell off assets of the non-performing businesses of Indian Hotels and Tata Chemicals. There were also reports that he was telling managers to pull up their socks. At the Tata Motors annual general meeting on 9 August, Mistry was reported to have said, I think the journey is going to be long and not for the faint-hearted.ALSO READ | Uneasy lies the Tata crownIn any case, analysts and industry experts say that four years is too short a time period to judge Mistrys performance by or even compare it with that of Ratan Tata, who was at the helm unfettered for three decades. It may also be a trifle unfair to hold Mistry responsible as chairman for the weak performance of some of the companies in his group, considering that he inherited massive problems.Clearly, Mistry was attempting to change the course of the ship, with a sharper focus on shareholder value. Unfortunately, he was not very communicative about his plans.What impact will the announcement have on Tata group shares? It is now up to the board to take immediate steps to restore investor confidence. Unless the uncertainty is resolved soon, Tata group shares may pay a price for the abrupt and opaque decision to replace Mistry and the failure to communicate to investors that the board had cogent reasons for doing so.",2016-10-25,408Zf7yPvqLWnOmSQTyfDL,"Tata group shares may pay a price for abrupt, opaque decision to replace Cyrus Mistry with Ratan Tata as interim chairman",07:33,The elephant unseats Cyrus Mistry

				According to a person familiar with the development, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the government on 12 October received a favourable order on two issues relating to its share of revenue from the fields.The panel ordered that marketing margin levied by the companies from customers have to be included in the revenue to be shared with the government and that only the actual taxes paid by the contractors can be allowed as a cost and not any notional tax rate mentioned in the contract signed in 1994. In the 1994-95 financial year, corporate tax rate ranged between 45% and 65% depending on tax residence (domestic or foreign) and public interest in the company, compared to 30% at present without surcharge.On a third aspect, the government received mostly a favourable order with an option for companies to file appeals before the tribunal within a month. Based on the two orders that are final with no option for appeals, the oil ministry will calculate the dues and issue notice without waiting any further, said the person. The dues are yet to be calculated.The companies maintained that the order was only partial and that they still have a window to fight the case.Even after the panel decides on every aspect of the dispute, dissatisfied parties are free to approach English courts for further relief.The arbitration was filed by Reliance and British Gas Exploration and Production India Ltd, while ONGC did not participate. BG, the operator of the field, has been taken over by Shell in a deal between the parents Royal Dutch Shell Plc. and BG Group Plc, completed in February.A Reliance spokesperson said, With respect to the arbitration in Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields, the arbitration tribunal has by majority issued a final partial award (FPA), and separately, two dissenting opinions. RIL is presently in the process of reviewing the FPA and the dissenting opinions in detail and shall be taking the appropriate next steps based on legal advice.A spokesperson for Shell India said the company was reviewing the final partial award in detail and was unable to share any further specific details due to confidentiality restrictions.We respect the decision of the Tribunal and are committed to following the due processes applicable to legal proceedings of this nature, said the spokesperson. The Reliance spokesperson added that the tribunal has scheduled a procedural hearing on 18 and 19 December, where the procedural timetable of the arbitration is likely to be decided. At this point in time, the financial consequences of the findings in the FPA are difficult to ascertain and clarity shall emerge after the tribunal decides upon the liabilities accruing to either parties after further hearings.",2016-10-26,SiOo4yJsye7OykJVwAKl5N,Oil ministry looks to recover revenue share dues from hydrocarbon production at the fields in the Arabian Sea after an arbitration panel ruled mostly in favour of the govt,01:16,PMT fields: Govt to serve demand notice to RIL-ONGC-Shell consortium

That led to the higher growth of 14% in its operating profit for the September quarter from the dismal 7.5% growth in the preceding three months. In the previous quarters, the companys run rate in operating profit growth was rather slow, compared with its loan book expansion.

2,0.247075,"Seoul: Samsung Electronics Co Ltd on Thursday said it aims to recover quickly from the disastrous withdrawal of the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 that dragged third-quarter mobile earnings to their lowest in nearly eight years. 
				   
				The worlds top smartphone maker saw its mobile earnings plunge 98% from a year earlier to its lowest since the fourth quarter of 2008, barely avoiding its first-ever loss and dragging the firms overall profit to a two-year low. Samsung said July-September operating profit was 5.2 trillion won ($4.57 billion), matching its revised guidance. The South Korean firm had initially estimated a 7.8 trillion won profit but cut its guidance to reflect losses incurred in the withdrawal of the fire-prone Note 7s.Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the company expects earnings to improve (from a year earlier) driven by strong performance in the components business, Samsung said in a statement. The mobile business expects a recovery in its earnings to a similar level with that of the fourth quarter of 2015.The mobile division booked an operating profit of 100 billion won in the third quarter. Earnings from smartphones and tablets have been the main driver of Samsungs rise into a global tech giant, accounting for 38% of total income last year. Samsung said it aims to bolster fourth-quarter earnings through its Galaxy S7 phones and new lower-tier models in a bid to record profit close to the 2.23 trillion won it reported in October-December of 2015. I am not positive about Samsungs mobile business until the first quarter, although the components division will remain solid, SK Securities analyst Kim Young-woo said.The Apple Inc rival has already warned of another $3.1 billion hit to profit through the first quarter of 2017, all but guaranteeing a third straight year of earnings decline for the smartphone business. Investors now expect sweeping management changes and restructuring in response to the Note 7 failure, while warily watching for signs of long-term impacts on the sales of other Samsung brands.Samsung shares were up 0.5% in early trade after the results announcement, compared with a 0.4% gain for the broader market.FrustrationsMany are frustrated that Samsung still does not know what caused the fires in some of the Note 7 devices that were sent to customers as replacements for the initial 2.5 million phones it recalled due to fire-prone batteries.The company gave no further insights in its earnings announcement. Development of the next Galaxy S smartphone  expected to launch in March 2017  has slowed as Samsung works to make sure there will be no repeat of the over-heating problem, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. The launch is unlikely to be brought forward to make up for Note 7 sales, the source said, contrary to some investors belief that the new Galaxy S will be fast-tracked. Stronger earnings from the companys components businesses was a bright spot in the third-quarter results. The semiconductor division reported a 3.37 trillion won profit for July-September, its highest since the third quarter of 2015.

318,0.243775,"Singapore/Seoul: Lee Jae-yong, the crown prince of the founding family that controls Samsung Group, is getting expanded corporate power. Now comes the guessing game about what hell do with it.
				   
				On Thursday, Lee officially joined a nine-person board at Samsung Electronics Co., whose botched roll out of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone has delivered a blow to a premier tech brand and cost the company billions of dollars in profit. The move gives the low-profile executive, also known as Jay Y., a big say over top management and strategic calls, including restructurings, mergers and asset sales.His ascension comes on the same day that Samsung reported a sharp decline in profits, as the recall took its toll. Net income fell to 4.41 trillion won ($3.9 billion) in the September quarter; the debacle that may ultimately cost more than $6 billion. Shares in the company rose 0.4% at the close of trade in Seoul.Lee, 48, is already vice chairman of Samsung Electronics and has gained influence since his father, Lee Kun-hee, suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized in 2014. The founding family controls Samsung Group, whose tentacles extend into financial services, hotels, biopharmaceuticals and fashion, through a complex network of cross ownership. So in a way, Lees elevation to the board of the flagship will be something akin to a coronation.We can now say that Lees regime has officially begun, said Lee Chaiwon, chief investment officer at Korea Value Asset Management Co. I think a new era is coming. Lee believes Jay Y.s enhanced influence will be an adrenaline shot for a company in crisis. The company will become more market-friendly, he said, predicting the new board member will quicken its restructuring process.Samsung Electronics has no shortage of challenges, urgent ones. In addition to mopping up after the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, the younger Lee faces a threat from activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. thats pushing Samsung Electronics to simplify its ownership structure. The New York-based fund, founded by stock picker Paul Singer, also wants the company to add independent directors and dish out a special $27 billion dividend to investors.Being a board member means management responsibility, said Heo Pil-seok, chief executive officer of Midas International Asset Management Co. The market will expect Lee to come up with some follow-up steps to settle the Note 7 problem.Samsungs management and board are carefully reviewing all of Elliotts proposals, senior vice-president Robert Yi told a conference call. After buying back more than 11 trillion won of stock since last year, the Suwon-based company plans to shed more light on its shareholder return policy next month, he said.While about 400 investors attended the meeting to vote on Jay Y.s appointment, the man himself wasnt there. Instead it was vice chairman Kwon Oh-hyun and co-chief executive officer Shin Jong-kyun who spoke about the crisis and management shortcomings.Shin said the number of incidents with the Note 7 was in the hundreds and Samsung was continuing to investigate as it revisits every aspect of its hardware, software and production processes.It is not acceptable that we did not meet our own quality assurance standards, said Shin, a former head of the phone business. We know we must work hard to earn back your trust and we are committed to doing just that.Then theres the broader sales slump at Samsung Electronics, which also makes semiconductors and display panels. The company is coping with a drop in LCD panel prices and lower-cost Chinese rivals in the television market. Total third-quarter sales fell to 47.8 trillion won and the company could record its third straight year of decelerating annual revenue, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. For the coming year, Samsung said its planning to spend a record 27 trillion won on plants and equipment as it boosts production of OLED displays.What Samsung needs the most now is the total shake-up of its system and personnel in order to refresh its collapsed brand image following the Note 7 crisis, said Chung Sun-sup, CEO of corporate research firm Chaebul.com. He sees Lees influence being felt across the entire Samsung empire, starting with groups annual management shake-up at the end of the year. He will legally play a lead role in the groups key affairs, including making big deals, personnel reshuffle and other financial agendas, he said.Owing to South Koreas tradition of filial piety, its been difficult for the younger Lee to take command since his father fell ill. That said, Lee attracted media attention in 2015 when he apologized on live television for a Samsung-owned hospitals failure to contain a Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome.Franz-Hermann Hirlinger, the first foreign outside director ever to serve at Samsung Electronics, remembers Lee as a young man who always sat in a corner with his back straight and hands neatly folded on his knees, quietly observing board meetings. Everyone in the room, including Hirlinger, knew that it was part of his training to succeed his father one day.That day has arrived. And Lee is already drawing criticism. Sustinvest Inc., a Seoul-based proxy-advisory firm, said in a letter to shareholders this week that Lee isnt qualified to be on the board because he benefited from inter-affiliate transactions at the Samsung group.There is a widespread expectation for vice chairman Lee to show that he is able to take charge and lead Samsung out of the crisis and usher in change, said Kim Sang-jo, a professor at Hansung University.People who have worked closely with Jay Y. describe him as a polar opposite of his larger-than-life father. The younger Lee is an affable, approachable man with a global view, who wants to modernize South Koreas largest business group, according to Hirlinger.In his new and expanded role, Lees performance will come under even greater scrutiny. Until now, Lee could just enjoy the good times and avoid the bad times and didnt have to take any legal responsibilities, said Chung with Chaebul.com. But if things like the Note 7 happens again, he said, many fingers will point at him. Bloomberg",2016-10-27,iCeczLlNyM59tEfmNqRosK,"Lee Jae-yong, 48, is already vice chairman of Samsung Electronics and has gained influence since his father, Lee Kun-hee, suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized in 2014",16:02,Samsung scion Lee Jae-yong begins reign amid Galaxy Note 7 smartphone crisis

On the software side, Apple delayed the release of iTunes 11 in 2012 by a month to fix bugs.Reviews of pre-production models of the AirPods suggested the device needed fine-tuning. During my testing one of the AirPods had trouble holding a charge, so Apple swapped it out, Walt Mossberg, of the technology website The Verge, wrote in September. Other reviewers noticed problems with music playback, a key feature of the AirPods.The introduction of the product spurred criticism that the cordless earphones could easily be lost. Comedian Conan OBrien mocked the device with a spoof of an iPod ad that showed people dancing and the AirPods flying out their ears into a sewage drain.The device is planned as part of a growing number of accessories that work around Apples most important product, the iPhone. Chief design officer Jony Ive last month referred to the AirPods as the start of a new wireless future for the company.

210,0.16685,"New Delhi/Singapore: India may turn into a net importer of fuel oil as its state-owned refiners are making multi-billion dollar investments to upgrade their refineries and produce more profitable refined products such as gasoline or diesel.
				   
				India has traditionally been a net exporter of fuel oil, the residue oil left after initial crude refining that is typically used in shipping and power generation. That is about to change. Three state-run energy firms  Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum  plan to spend $20 billion on refinery expansions to add units by 2022 that would process fuel oil into gasoline and diesel, boosting their output to meet growing local demand for transport fuels.Our fuel oil production will be less because everywhere we are going for residue upgrades, said B. Ashok, chairman of the countrys biggest refiner Indian Oil Corp (IOC).Private refiners Reliance Industries and Essar Oil have already invested heavily to build advanced refineries which produce gasoline at the expense of fuel oil.With state refiners now doing the same, India will soon have to sharply raise imports of fuel oil, two traders that participate in the market said. Indias net fuel oil exports averaged 109,000 tonnes from April to September, according to the countrys Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell, and the traders estimate this could flip into a need to raise fuel oil imports as early as late 2017.As a result, the price difference between diesel and fuel oil could narrow further from its current $17.61 a barrel, as Indian shipping fuel demand rises with the governments thrust on the coastal movement of cargoes, considered more cost efficient than road transport.Already, gasoil and fuel oil differentials have started shrinking from about $30 three years ago to $16-$18 now and it is likely to narrow further as refiners are destroying fuel oil to produce gasoil and gasoline, said S. Thangapandian, director at Gulf Petrochem.Indian refiners expansion plans almost coincide with changing shipping fuel norms from 2020 requiring the use of low-sulphur fuels.IOC is the biggest expansion investor, planning to spend Rs50,000 crore ($7.48 billion) by 2022 to raise its refining capacity by about 30% to 2.08 million barrels per day (bpd) including expanding its Panipat refinery in northern India to about 400,000 to 500,000 bpd.HPCL and BPCL plan to spend $11.25 billion to expand refineries and install fuel oil upgrading units, halting fuel oil output in almost all plants.

173,0.2325,"New Delhi: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has received the delivery of the worlds first very large ethane carrying ships that will be used for ferrying the fuel from the US.
				   
				Reliance had in 2014 ordered building of six Very Large Ethane Carriers (VLECs) at Samsung Heavy Industries Pvt. Ltd shipyards in Korea. The vessels are the first to feature new membrane technology from French specialist Gaztransport & Technigaz SA(GTT), considered key to the execution of the project.With a capacity of 87,000 cubic meters, the two vessels are the largest ethane carriers built to date.In a ceremony held in Geoje (South Korea), RIL inaugurated its very first two VLECs, GTT said in a statement.The two vessels, named Ethane Crystal and Ethane Emerald, are the first in a series of six VLECs ordered by RIL in 2014.Japans biggest shipping company Mitsui OSK Lines Pvt. Ltd will manage and operate the ships for RIL.Ethane, a natural gas component, is expected to be produced in large volumes in North America due to the shale gas revolution, which has generated an abundance of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Ethane is primarily used as a petrochemical feedstock to produce ethylene by steam cracking.RIL plans to ship 1.5 million tonnes a year of ethane from its US shale joint ventures to its chemical complex in Gujarat. The firm has two joint ventures (JVs) in Pennsylvanias Marcellus Shaleone with Chevron Corp., in which it has invested $1.7 billion, and another with Houston-based Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc., in which it has invested $392 million. It has a third JV, in which it invested $1.5 billion, in Texas Eagle Ford Shale group with Dallas-based Pioneer Natural Resources Co.The worlds richest energy billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led RILs business spans petrochemicals, exploration and production, retail and telecommunications. As per the original contract, Samsung was to deliver the ships to be used for ethane transportation, from October 2016 to January 2017. Each ship is priced at $120 million.VLECs are a hybrid of LNG and LPG carriers. Due to the expectation of competitively priced ethane as opposed to naphtha, a crude oil byproduct, petrochemical producers are hoping to lower their production costs by using ethane.The VLECs are to transport liquefied ethane from the US to the Dahej terminal in Gujarat, which will be used to supply feedstock for RILs crackers in Dahej, Hazira and Nagothane.RIL has an ethane supply contract in place with Enterprise Product Partners out of their Morgans Point terminal in the US Gulf, which exported its first ethane cargo in September on a 27,500 cubic meter vessel for Ineos.Earlier this week, RIL had stated that it has secured a $573 million of loan for part-financing of the vessel construction costs.",2016-10-28,OGRgM8F15eacBFWFH19ugP,"The two vessels, named Ethane Crystal and Ethane Emerald, are the first in a series of six Very Large Ethane Carriers ordered by RIL in 2014",20:22,RIL gets worlds first very large ethane-carrying ships
28,0.248425,"Canadas Brookfield Asset Management Inc. is in talks to buy the operational wind energy assets of Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners-controlled renewable energy platform Continuum Wind Energy, two people aware of the development said.
				   
				Brookfield has been keen on acquiring renewable energy assets in India. They have recently started talks with Continuum to acquire the entire operational portfolio of the company, said one of the two people, requesting anonymity as the talks are private.Continuum has almost 400 megawatts (MW) of operational wind energy assets in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, he said. Investment bank Moelis and Co. is advising Continuum on the transaction, he added.According to the second of the two people, the transaction size could be in the range of Rs1,700-2,000 crore in terms of enterprise value. He also spoke on the condition of anonymity.Brookfield manages assets worth around $250 billion across various geographies and asset classes such as real estate, infrastructure, renewable energy and private equity.Continuum has been in talks for sometime to sell these assets. They had reached a deal with SunEdison, which later got scrapped because of SunEdisons financial troubles. Recently they were also in talks to raise primary capital with Partners Group, but those talks havent reached any conclusion and now they have engaged in discussions with Brookfield, the second person added.In June 2015, SunEdison had announced that it would acquire Continuums assets. In September, however, the deal was scrapped owing to SunEdisons financial problems. Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners is the majority owner in Continuum Wind, a Singapore-based, India-focused firm, in which it invested $212 million in 2012. Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners manages $4 billion globally.Continuum was set up in 2009 by Arvind Bansal and Vikash Saraf. Moelis and Partners Group declined to comment. Emails sent on Tuesday to Brookfield and Morgan Stanley did not elicit any response.Continuums asset sale talks with Brookfield come against the backdrop of a strong consolidation drive in Indias renewable energy industry.In June, Tata Power Co. Ltd acquired around 1.1 gigawatts of solar and wind power assets from Welspun Enterprise Ltd at an enterprise value of $1.4 billion.In September, Hyderabad-based renewable company Greenko Energy Holdings, acquired SunEdison Inc.s Indian solar asset portfolio for around $392 million. Also, in September, Mint had reported that Rahul Puris Hindustan Powerprojects Pvt. Ltd had initiated discussions with investors to sell around 300MW of solar assets, which could fetch the company around $300 million.Brookfield has become one of the most active infrastructure asset buyers in India in the past 12 months.Since announcing its intent to acquire nine infrastructure assets from Gammon Infrastructure Ltd in August 2015, it has been actively scouting for more.On 15 October, Brookfield signed a term sheet to acquire a 51% stake in Reliance Communications Ltds telecom tower assets for around Rs11,000 crore. Brookfield was also in talks to buy Reliance Infrastructures road assets.In one of the largest real estate deals in recent years, Brookfield is acquiring office and retail assets of Hiranandani Developers Pvt.

31,0.2392,"Sydney: India is scouting for new liquefied natural gas contracts globally as part of a push to secure cheap supplies for its under-utilized gas-fired power plants.
				   
				Australia, Qatar and Iran could all act as potential suppliers of long-term LNG contracts, power minister Piyush Goyal said in Sydney on Thursday. The global search for LNG comes as Indias gas-fired plants, which can generate nearly 25 gigawatts of power, run at less than a quarter of their capacity because of a shortage of the fuel at affordable prices.I think gas needs to be between $5 and $5.50 landed at my power plant. That is what Im looking for in the medium- to long-term, Goyal said in an interview. Otherwise I wont be able to start those gas plants.NTPC Ltd., Indias biggest power producer, is said to be seeking to terminate a long-term supply contract for LNG because the fuel is too expensive to be used in power generation. That highlights the countrys difficulty in switching from coal to natural gas for power generation, undermining Prime Minister Narendra Modis efforts to cut carbon emissions and promote clean energy.As of now I dont have any credible offer on the table but Im fairly confident from talking to people across the world that if not Australia, maybe Qatar will give it to me, or Iran might be able to get me something, Goyal said. Ill go to Europe next week to discuss the same thing. I am sure Ill find a seller.Spot LNG in Singapore rose to $6.542 per million British thermal units this week, the highest since December, according to the Singapore Exchange Ltd. Prices are up more than 65% from a low in April.Australia investmentsIndia is also targeting investments in Australian LNG projects and coking coal mines to secure fresh sources of supply, Goyal said.We could buy stakes, we could buy the whole LNG plant itself, we could look at coal mines, Goyal said.Petronet LNG Ltd., Indias biggest LNG importer, signed a pact with Exxon Mobil Corp. in 2009 for supply of 1.5 million tons of the super-chilled fuel for 20 years from the Gorgon LNG project in Australia. Supplies are expected to begin next month.Goyal also expects Indian companies to boost their investments in Australia despite delays to Adani Enterprises Ltd.s Carmichael mine in Queensland, which was hampered by environmental protests. The Queensland government earlier this month invoked special powers to accelerate the project.

280,0.24745,"Bengaluru: Google parent Alphabet Inc. bested analysts estimates for third-quarter profit and revenue on Thursday as the search company showed it has honed its core business for the mobile era and is closing in on the next wave of computing. 
				   
				Propelled by strong advertising on mobile devices and video site YouTube, Alphabets net income climbed 27% to $5.06 billion. Revenue jumped 20% to $22.45 billion, marking the search giants seventh straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth. The company authorized a $7 billion repurchase of its Class C stock, pleasing investors who had been craving more after a $5 billion repurchase last year. Google is competing fiercely with social network Facebook Inc. for dominance in the fast-growing mobile advertising market. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai touted the companys gains in the space, and was bullish about recent product launches such as the Google Assistant, the Google Home smart speaker and refinements to the enterprise cloud business.The products are aimed at the rise of voice search, which many analysts believe will succeed keyboards and touch screens as a primary way users interact with devices. We feel well positioned as we transition to a new era of computing, Pichai said in an conference call. This new era is one in which people will experience computing more naturally and seamlessly in the context of their lives, powered by intelligent assistants and the cloud.Shares of Alphabet, the worlds No. 2 company by market value, were up 1.6% in after-hours trading.The company posted third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $9.06, beating expectations of $8.63 a share on revenues of $22.05 billion, according to Thomson Reuters estimates.Google has been dogged by concerns about how it would nudge its vast web advertising business towards mobile, but the companys recent performance has reassured Wall Street that the transition is well underway, said analyst Colin Gillis of BGC Partners.Its showing that even though theyve hit lifetime highs, theres still room to run, he said. Advertising revenue, the companys lifeblood, rose 18.1% to $19.82 billion in the third quarter. Paid clicks, or ads for which advertisers pay only when users click on them, rose 33%, compared with a rise of 29% in the second quarter. Cost-per-click, or the average amount advertisers pay Google, fell 11% in the latest period, but investors are willing to forgive the slump for now, as it suggests strong mobile growth, said analyst Kerry Rice of Needham & Co. YouTube continued to post robust gains, Pichai said. Over the past year, Google, Facebook and Twitter Inc. have all doubled down on video, a format where advertisers are willing to pay a premium for a few seconds of users undivided attention. Advertising accounted for 89.1% of Googles total revenue in the quarter, and analysts are eager for the company to tap new sources of growth. One of the leading contenders is Googles cloud business, which drove a 38.8% rise in the companys other revenue.As we head into 2017, I expect cloud to be one of our largest areas of investment, Pichai said. A relatively late entrant to the cloud business, Google is trying to steal market share from industry leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Amazon on Thursday reported a 55% revenue increase in its cloud business.I would hesitate to say they are competing head-to-head, but they are making up for lost ground, Rice said. Alphabets Other Bets unit generated revenue of $197 million, primarily from Nest, Google Fiber and Verily units, chief financial officer Ruth Porat said during the call. Alphabet said this week it was pausing the rollout of Fiber, a high-speed internet service, in some US cities and that its leader Craig Barratt would leave. Porat played down analysts concerns of instability at Other Bets, which has suffered a wave of executive departures, including Nest founder Tony Fadell, self-driving car technology chief Chris Urmson and, most recently, Barratt.As we reach for moonshots that will have a big impact in the longer term, its inevitable that there will be course corrections along the way, and that some efforts will be more successful than others, Porat said.Other Bets, which also includes research unit X, reported an operating loss of $865 million, down from a year-ago loss of $980 million. The narrowing loss suggests Porat is instilling the financial discipline investors have long hoped to see from the company, said Gillis.Everybody loves Ruth, he said.

377,0.2448,"Wipro Ltd, for now, is lagging behind Infosys Ltd in growth. Still, when it comes to mergers and acquisitions (M&As) and investments in start-ups made by the two rivals over the last two years, Infosys Ltds boss Vishal Sikka may want to look at Wipros playbook, overseen by chief strategy officer Rishad Premji. 
				   
				Rishad Premji is the son of Wipro chairman Azim Premji, and reports to Wipro chief executive officer Abidali Neemuchwala.Over the last year, Infosys, surprisingly, has shied away from buyouts, despite spending $390 million to purchase three firms in the first year of Sikkas tenure (see chart). Infosys is grappling with finding a stable management team to steer its M&A division. In July this year, Sikka asked Deepak Padaki to head the M&A team, just 18 months after Infosys reposed faith in Sikkas former SAP colleague, Ritika Suri, to oversee the M&A division.Finally, the pace of investments in start-ups made by Infosys has slowed; the firm has made only two investments since January. Infosys has spent some $33 million (out of its $500 million fund to invest in start-ups) to buy stakes in eight start-ups and an undisclosed amount in Vertex Ventures, a Palo Alto-based venture capital firm. Seven of these investments were made in 2015.M&A is an important theme for Infosys as the management expects $1.5 billion in new revenue from buyouts as part of Sikkas ambitious target of hitting $20 billion in revenue by March 2021. The three buyouts made by Infosys, for now, are estimated to bring less than $90 million in revenue.Wipros strategy is the most aggressive among home-grown IT firms, and can become a template for both Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys, its bigger rivals, in how to better deploy cash and also invest in areas which can make outsourcing companies future-ready.Wipro, in the last 18 months (since April last year, when Neemuchwala joined the company as chief operating officer), has spent over $1.13 billion in making four buyouts which, in addition to making the firm future-ready, together bring in over $550 million in revenue. TCS boss N. Chandrasekaran has not made a single buyout or an investment in start-ups in the last two years. Wipro has done a better job of M&A than most IT services firms to date, said Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm. They (Wipro) have been more deliberate whereas Accenture has been very aggressive, although the net results are the same. Wipro has got new service mixes and capabilities along with new clients. One aspect is the emphasis of taking company cultural considerations into play.Wang said that it appears that Infosys has slowed down M&As and venture activities. Infosys maintains that it continues to evaluate firms and start-ups and there is no slowdown in decision-making. Im very focused that every business unit should not have more than one acquisition to integrate and digest, Neemuchwala told Mint last week, explaining that M&As will bring in a significant share of revenue in Wipros ambition of becoming a $15 billion firm by 2020.Wipro has spent over $22 million (of a $100 million fund) in picking minority stakes in seven start-ups and a venture fund.Sikkas and Rishad Premjis style of running their M&A and venture arms is also different, as none of Infosyss executives, including Suri (who oversees Infosys Innovation Fund), have any experience in the venture capital space. In contrast, Wipros venture arm is run by Venu Pemmaraju, a former senior investment manager at Intel Capital, and company executive Biplab Adhya, who both report to Rishad Premji.One of the biggest benefits Wipro has accrued from its buyouts is that it has managed to retain the tag of Indias third largest software services firm, leaving HCL Technologies Ltd to be content at the fourth position.Wipro does not spell out the growth brought in from its four buyouts and the organic growth, but a senior executive conceded that the growth in core IT services has considerably slowed down. If Wipro manages to grow at the upper end of its 2% growth forecast in the fourth quarter, it will add $445.3 million in incremental revenue in calendar year 2016. The four buyouts are estimated to have accounted for at least $350 million in new business, translating to about 78% of all new business.HCL Technologies, which reported $6.23 billion in yearly revenue at the end of March 2016, will end with $7.04 billion in revenue at the end of March next year if it manages to grow at the managements at-best 13% annual guidance. Wipro, which does not give annual growth guidance, is expected by analysts to report at-best 5.5% growth, translating to the company recording $7.75 billion in revenue at the end of the current financial year.",2016-10-29,qeaQ9hDqenc00ogIsHBKlM,"Wipros M&A strategy, overseen by Rishad Premji, is the most aggressive among home-grown IT firms, and can become a template for TCS and Sikkas Infosys",00:03,Has Wipros Rishad Premji triumphed over Infosyss Vishal Sikka?

OVL will tie-up long-term financing in the next six to nine months to replace the bridge loan, he said. Besides OVLs 26%, a consortium of comprising Oil India (OIL), Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Bharat PetroResources (BPRL) has acquired 23.9% stake in the field at a cost of $2.02 billion, giving them 6.56 million tons of oil.Also Read: Cabinet allows ONGC Videsh to buy 11% stake in Russias JSC Vankorneft After the stake sales, Rosneft holds 50.1%  stake in JSC Vankorneft, the company that operates the Vankor oilfield.

That agreement was subject to certain conditions including approvals from the Indian and Russian governments. All approvals are in place, leading to closure of the deal, he said. The completion within very short period of the binding agreement reflects the speed and cooperation with which both OVL and Rosneft have moved and the support that the investments by Indian companies in Russian oil sector enjoy with the Russian and Indian governments. Vankor is Rosnefts (and Russias) second largest field by production and accounts for 4% of the countrys production.Also Read: OVL, Rosneft sign pact for 11% stake in Vankorneft The daily production from the field is around 410,000 barrels per day of crude oil and 26% stake would give OVL about 107,000 bpd. The acquisition of additional 11% would add about 30% to the existing OVLs production at the current rate and approximately 2.2 million tons of oil and 1.0 billion cubic meters of gas annually, he said.

				Provisions and contingencies surged 755% to Rs2,074.94 crore in the July-September quarter from Rs242.70 crore a year earlier. The loss during the second quarter was restricted due to a tax write-back of Rs197.12 crore against tax expenses of Rs189.87 crore a year ago.This is one of the biggest losses reported by an associate bank of the State Bank of India (SBI). In the April-June period, State Bank of Travancore had reported a loss of Rs743 crore due to deteriorating asset quality concerns.The drop in profitability of associate banks might be a result of the impending merger with State Bank of India, which has been approved by all of them. In August, the respective boards of SBI, State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Travancore, State Bank of Hyderabad and Bharatiya Mahila Bank had all approved the mega merger, which will create a large banking conglomerate in India. According to a Mint analysis, this will put SBI in the ranks of the top 50 lenders in the world.The associate banks reported large losses as a direct result of the asset quality review (AQR) conducted by RBI in the October-December period last year, SBI management had stated earlier.Their AQR was very different from ours and this was required in order to align our books, so that when it (merger) happens, there are no surprises.

37,0.2479,"Beijing: China is seeking to build up export markets for its power amid signs the nation has invested too much in new generation plants.
				   
				State Grid Corp. of China, which runs the majority of the nations electricity distribution network, is considering how to build links to India, South Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia, a move that would require billions of dollars of investment in long-distance, high-voltage power lines.Interconnections would allow grid managers throughout the region to more flexibility use variable supplies coming from wind and solar farms cropping up from Vietnam to Mongolia. For China, the links would provide customers for power from hundreds of power plants finished in the past few years as demand in its domestic market stagnates.We can export to India and Southeast Asia where the power supply is inadequate, Zhang Qiping, chief engineer of State Grid, said on Tuesday at a conference hosted by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) in Shanghai.China, which is the worlds biggest investor in fossil-fuel generation, started more than 70 gigawatts of new coal projects last year and had 200 gigawatts under construction at the end of April, the Paris-based International Energy Agency said in September. At the same time, most plants are sitting idle more than half the time, and low-carbon sources of electricity including nuclear and renewables are covering additional demand.That report added weight to concerns voiced by environmental groups such as Greenpeace that China is apt to waste 1 trillion yuan ($148 billion) on excess power capacity by 2020.At the BNEF conference in Shanghai, energy policymakers from China, Thailand and Mongolia spoke about the merits of building a regional network of power interconnections, which would help reduce the cost of electricity and make grids more flexible in dealing with renewables. The issue is biggest for China, which has the largest power network in the region.Asia will be an important part in the global energy interconnection, Wang Min, vice general manager at State Grid, said at the BNEF meeting. The region, he said, has the biggest potential in energy economic growth and is a region with the most and fast-growing energy demand.Shift indicatedThe remarks at the BNEF conference are the fullest indication yet that the bid for interconnections has backing from the Chinese government. Wang said the effort fits with president Xi Jinpings effort launched in September 2015 to reduce pollution in Chinas power utility industry, part of the nations commitment with the US to hold back greenhouse gases damaging the climate.Regional interconnections will help each nation achieve targets to cap carbon emissions under the United Nations climate deal agreed in Paris last year, said Yao Qiang, vice general manager of Power Construction Corp. of China Ltd. The effort to replace fossil fuels with renewables is an unstoppable trend, he said.Also Read: China steel behemoth gets finishing touchesSignals pointing toward the priority that China places on inter-connectors emerged in March.

Created in March, Wangs organization is designed to promote links throughout the region.Its doable in technology, said Wang, adding current ultra-high voltage lines can transmit as much as 15 gigawatts of power through 5,000 kilometers.The organization is planning to draft a plan by the end of this year for transmitting power from East China to South Korea and then to Japan, Wang said.

351,0.246,"The anonymity of bitcoin gained its myriad adherents among anarchists and drug dealers around the world. Now, though, its looking like the digital currency isnt quite anonymous enough.
				   
				Consider the sudden popularity of Zcash and Monero, two new cryptocurrencies that offer confidential transactions. When Zcash first became available last week, demand was so strong that its founders temporarily became paper billionaires. Monero rose to fame after a popular marketplace in the dark webthe portion of the Internet where people sell everything from guns to hacking toolsadded it as a payment option. The newcomers sense opportunity in one of bitcoins flaws: Analytics companiesfueled by government research grantshave gotten really good at exposing users identities, which were supposed to be hidden by public keys that reduced them to a mere string of numbers and letters. This is possible because all transactions are recorded in a permanent public ledger, allowing anyone to see the entire history of each bitcoin and all the activity of each account. A single payment to an online retailer can be enough to reveal a users identity, which in turn reveals everything that person has done with that account.In other words, the same transparency that guarantees the validity of bitcoin transactions also allows people to find out whether a users bitcoin previously passed through dirty hands. Such information is both an asset and a liability. Its useful for helping service providers make informed decisions about whether they want someone as a customer, but it can come with the responsibility of having to screen those customers to stay on the right side of the law. The US government, for example, has outsourced some of its crime-fighting job by requiring financial institutionsincluding digital currency exchangesto enforce anti-money-laundering regulations. Drug-dealing and tax evasion can be tough to stop at the source, but the perpetrators typically have to move money, so banks and exchanges are in a good position to identify and report illicit activity.On the surface, privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies seem designed precisely to undermine such controls. Monero mixes multiple transactions together so that a source cannot be directly linked to a destination. Zcash creates shielded transactions where everything is hidden except for a string of data that proves the transaction is valid. Bitcoin also plans to add some of these features in the near future.As bad as it looks, though, developers arent creating anonymous payment systems because they want to help criminals evade the law. Theyre doing it because thats the only way a decentralised currency can work. If, say, users have to evaluate the acceptability of each bitcoin based on its transaction history, then one coin can be worth more than another and the currency loses its reason for existence.The dollar is successful because its pretty much always worth a dollar, backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. Thats true whether its freshly printed or old and torn, whether it has a pristine history or has passed through the hands of Al Capone. A publicly controlled digital currency doesnt have that legal tender status and probably never will, so it must find some other way to achieve the same fungibility.Anonymity achieves this by preventing merchants or service providers from seeing any blemishes that might prevent them from honouring a unit of currency. Reducing the opportunity for external judgment is pretty much the goal of privacy protection in general. Ideally, so little information is revealed that everyoneand every valid transactionis treated equally.Decentralised currencies arose because people wanted to transact in a digital world without having to ask permission. The extent to which this facilitates criminal activity depends entirely on the prevalence of criminal activity in the real world. Maybe thats a problem that needs to be addressed outside the monetary system.

336,0.236475,"Tokyo: Sony Corp. cut its annual profit forecast by 10% after taking an impairment on the sale of its battery unit in the latest move by the consumer electronics giant to focus on its most lucrative businesses.
				   
				Operating income will be 270 billion yen ($2.6 billion) in the year ending March, down from a projected 300 billion yen, the firm said on Monday. Analysts had earlier expected 307.5 billion yen of earnings this fiscal year, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Sony agreed to sell its battery unit to Murata Manufacturing Co. for about 17.5 billion yen and also transfer 8,500 workers, resulting in a 33 billion yen impairment for its components business. The company had announced the sale in July without disclosing a price, but warned the deal would likely negatively impact earnings. The charge was less than some analysts expected, with Credit Suisse Group AG predicting a 40 billion yen writedown earlier this year.Its very positive because its one division that has been underperforming, said Amir Anvarzadeh, Singapore-based head of Japanese equity sales at BGC Partners Inc. 8,500 employees is a lot of employees for a loss-making division.

263,0.235575,"Tokyo: Japans Sony Corp. on Tuesday reported a 48% drop in operating profit for the July-September quarter as earthquake damage continued to affect its cash-cow imaging sensor business.
				   
				Second-quarter profit fell to 45.7 billion yen from 88 billion yen a year earlier. That compared with a Thomson Reuters Starmine SmartEstimate of 46.27 billion yen drawn from 10 analyst estimates.The result came a day after Sony lowered its full-year profit forecast by 10% to 270 billion yen due mainly to an impairment charge of 33 billion yen brought about by the sale of its battery business.Investors were unfazed by the downward revision as Sony maintained its sales outlook of 7.4 trillion yen, and losses related to the battery business sale had been flagged earlier.Its shares closed down 0.75 ahead of the earnings release, compared with a flat finish in the benchmark Nikkei stock price index.Emerging from years of restructuring, the consumer electronics manufacturer is refocusing its business to concentrate on video games, entertainment and imaging sensors, and the sale of its battery business was part of that effort.Its sensors business continued to struggle in the second quarter as a key factory damaged by a series of earthquakes in April took almost half a year to recover to pre-disaster levels.The business is part of Sonys semiconductor division, which swung to an operating loss of 4.2 billion yen from a year-before profit of 34.1 billion yen.The company nevertheless trimmed its estimated quake impact on full-year earnings to 53.5 billion yen from 80 billion yen.In gaming, operating profit fell to 19.0 billion yen from 23.9 billion yen as income earned abroad was dulled by a strong domestic currency.Investors are betting on momentum in the gaming business to pick up toward the year-end holiday shopping season with the launch later this month of the PlayStation 4 Pro, an upgrade capable of rendering high-definition graphics.Sony is also widely expected to build an early lead in the fledgling virtual-reality (VR) market, with a headset priced more modestly than those of rivals and available to its 40 million existing users of its flagship consoles.Analysts said VR could help Sony attract non-core gamers to its PlayStation platform as the firm looks to extend content for the headset into non-gaming areas such as music, TV and film.

350,0.249025,"Bengaluru: Customer support software maker Freshdesk Inc. on Tuesday said it raised $55 million in funding, in a round led by new investor Sequoia Capital, with participation from existing investor Accel Partners.
				   
				Freshdesk, which is based in San Bruno, California and has a large presence in Chennai, raised $50 million from Tiger Global Management in April 2015. This latest round of funding brings the total amount raised by the company to $150 million, making it one of the most well capitalized product start-ups in India. The firms earlier investors include Google Capital.The six-year-old start-up makes software that helps small and medium businesses handle their customers. It sells this software to companies over the Internet for a monthly fee, in a model known as software as a service (SaaS). Although enterprise SaaS dominates now, small and medium business SaaS will overtake it by 2020, according to a March 2016 report by Google and Accel India, which predicts that the $24 billion revenue from the small and medium business SaaS market in 2015 will increase to $76 billion by then.Freshdesk said it will use the additional funds to focus on the new products it launched earlier this year.After starting out with one product, also called Freshdesk, a cloud-based customer support platform, in 2014 it launched Freshservice, which helps companies meet their internal IT support requests.In February, it launched Hotline.io, which allows businesses to provide support to their customers from within apps, and its most recent product launch is called Freshsales, a CRM software to help sales teams.While typical SaaS companies build one product, and invest heavily in sales to conquer the market for that one product, Freshdesk believes there is great scope in building an ecosystem of products that complement each other.Also Read: Freshdesk buys chat-bot firm ChatimityAnalysts say this is prudent for a company catering to small businesses.Although a multi-vendor approach is the most popular when it comes to CRM, for the SMB (small and medium business) market, it is easier if they pick everything from one company. The smaller the company is, the easier this will be, said Olive Huang, research director at advisory firm Gartner.Huang also said that Freshdesk needs to create differentiation to stand out. What if their bigger counterparts reduce price in their segment? They wouldnt have any space. Eventually they cannot sell only because they are cheaper; they have to have a differentiator. That hasnt come up yet, she said.Freshdesk serves more than 80,000 customers, although it doesnt disclose how many of these are premium paying customers and how many use the free service it offers. It has around 850 employees and has regional offices in London, Sydney and Berlin.According to the Magic Quadrant research report for CRM vendors, published by Gartner earlier this year, Freshdesks solution is very good at the basics.

353,0.24785,"Global private equity firm KKR-backed Avendus Capital will be managing $2 billion by the end of the current financial year, a top executive of the firm said.
				   
				We should reach assets under management (AUM) of almost $2 billion (approximately Rs13,300 crore) in the next three to four months. Currently, we are at Rs10,000 crore. We have grown substantially in the past couple of years. Around two-three years ago, we were at Rs4,000 crore, said George Mitra, chief executive officer of Avendus Wealth Management.The rapidly growing wealth management practice was started by Avendus Capital in 2009 out of a need to build a business with recurring revenue stream as compared with the firms advisory business.Avendus Capital has been at the front-lines of Indias start-up funding boom, engineering several transactions and emerging as the top new economy-oriented investment bank. But the business of an investment bank is a transaction-oriented one.Till 2008-09, the only business Avendus was in was financial advisory. We realized if you have to grow to become a major financial institution from a boutique investment bank, you need recurring revenues, said Mitra.Towards this end, Avendus entered the asset management and wealth management businesses, although it smartly leveraged its strength. We were creating value for a lot of entrepreneurs on the advisory side. The thought process behind the wealth business was that it provided us another touch point with those same entrepreneurs. Wealth could provide a bridge between transactions; so, as a platform, we could maintain a continuity of relationship with the entrepreneur, said Mitra.Later, Avendus also added more clients in the form of general partners (GPs) of private equity funds that the firm dealt with regularly on the advisory side. The Avendus wealth management practice continues to focus on this inner circle of relationships built through the advisory practice. We are very focused. We dont service anyone outside the sphere of entrepreneurs, family offices and GPs of funds. We dont have too many clients. Today, we have a little more than 300 clients, said Mitra.That focus has worked.While we appeal to people who have more than Rs25 crore (to invest), we have had clients whom we have taken on board with Rs50 lakh to Rs1 crore and who have, over time, grown to become Rs200 crore and more. Thats how we have grown as a firm, by continuing (to be) with entrepreneurs on their life journey, said Mitra.The growth has also been helped by the exit of several foreign banks from the wealth management business over the past four-five years. Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, UBS and EFG Group have exited the wealth management business. Taking advantage of this disruption, we expanded our team big time. At the end of last calendar year, we were a 20-member team. Today, we are almost 50-strong. We have doubled our sales force; but on the product and operations side, the growth has been far more, said Mitra.The KKR brand too has helped. There is a lot of brand recognition for KKR and the rub-off effect of a large institution which has strong processes. It gives people the comfort that there wont be mis-selling, said Mitra.According to Kotak Wealth Managements Top Of The Pyramid 2016 report, the number of ultra high net-worth individuals in India is estimated to have grown to 146,600 in fiscal 2016, from around 137,100 the previous year.In 2015-16, these individuals had a combined net worth of Rs135 trillion, the report added.",2016-11-02,myJJCficvpQScVcVKWJmyH,Avendus Capitals growth in the wealth management business has been aided by the exit of foreign banks such as Morgan Stanley and BofA-ML from the sector,23:55,Avendus aims to manage $2 billion assets by fiscal end
326,0.248825,"Hong Kong: Its not the e-commerce business thatll command the most attention when Alibaba Group Holding Ltd posts earnings Wednesday. Its the nascent cloud computing division that investors will scrutinize instead.
				   
				Chinas largest Internet company reports just a week before Katy Perry and other stars headline a launch party for the annual Singles Day online shopping extravaganza. Yet its the less flashy Internet-based computing unit thats in the spotlight now that its e-commerce juggernaut is plateauing and the payoff from nascent businesses such as entertainment remains years away.Taking Amazon.com Inc.s approach, Alibaba has placed cloud at the heart of its global expansion, eyeing top share in Japan in two years and beefing up its presence from the Middle East to the US. It already hosts more than a third of Chinas websites. The companys fastest-growing division probably helped power 53% growth in group revenue to 33.9 billion yuan ($5 billion) last quarter, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. And unlike other businesses such as video streaming or on-demand services, it may be close to contributing to the bottom line. People have really high expectations for the cloud unit, said Billy Leung, an analyst at Haitong International Securities Co. For me, its already in the books, in the share price.Shares of Alibaba have surged 24% this year compared with a rise of just 2.7% for the NYSE Composite Index.Alibaba has only recently begun to make inroads beyond China and into a global cloud market dominated by Amazon and Microsoft Corp. Its the biggest provider of Internet-based computingeverything from storage and data analysis to server hostingfor government agencies and corporations within its home market, but abroad its more narrowly focused on supporting Chinese-based organizations on foreign soil. The division now accounts for less than 5% of Alibabas revenue, the lions share of which comes from an e-commerce division still growing at double-digit rates.But that proportion is climbing steadily and could help the company grapple with a profusion of difficulties facing the wider economy. Chinese gross domestic product grew 6.7% in the third quarter, its slowest pace of expansion since 2009. One of the key focuses this quarter will be Alibabas cloud unit performance, said Li Muzhi, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Arete Research Services LLP who expects the units revenue to soar 130% to 1.49 billion yuan. If Alibabas cloud unit breaks even this quarter, that would be a confidence booster for investors.Like Amazons, Alibabas cloud service emerged from the enormous computational power needed to handle millions of online shopping transactions. But unlike its US counterpart, it enjoys home-field advantage in a vast Chinese market where web-based computing is still novel to many enterprises. Its push into cloud, where software and services are provided to customers via server farms the size of football fields, prompted a second data center in Silicon Valley and preparation for its first in Europe. Along the way, Alibaba forged partnerships with industry giants like Intel Corp. and Nvidia Corp. In July, the divisions president proclaimed it could match or even surpass Amazon within three to four years.Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma once referred to data as the new oil. Chief executive officer Daniel Zhang said last month that cloud computing will underpin the upgrading of Chinas $4 trillion retail market, one of the companys biggest opportunities. He envisions building a system that monitors in-store sales as they happen, giving retailers and brands the ability to adjust in real time.If that happens, the cloud could well become one of Alibabas bigger profit centers. Amazon Web Services earned $861 million of operating income last quarter, by far the US companys most lucrative division.Alibaba said in August that the unit was close to breaking even, driven by some 577,000 paying customers. Overall, Alibaba is expected to post 7 billion yuan of net income, a 69% drop propelled in part by the integration of loss-making online video streaming business Youku Tudou and Lazada Group SA, acquired earlier this year.Cloud is the next revenue driver, Credit Suisse analysts Evan Zhou and Monica Chen wrote in a note last week, tagging its growth for the September quarter at about 147%.

221,0.2498,"Mukesh Ambani-promoted Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJio) has changed the metrics of the telecom business in India to such an extent that market leader Bharti Airtel Ltd has taken note. 
				   
				After a series of allegations over issues related to points of interconnection, predatory pricing and Internet usage charge, there seems to be a truce between Airtel and Jio.ALSO READ | Reliance Jio is here to stay: Airtel CEOIn an interview, Airtel chief executive Gopal Vittal said Jios entry strategy is good and bold and that the firm is here to stay. Vittal, however, said Airtel will continue to bank upon its spectrum assets, brand, network expansion and capital expenditure. Edited excerpts:How do you look at your operations in the wake of Jios entry?We still feel there is an opportunity in the rural areas and we are going deeper there to drive penetration. We believe managing price volume trade-off to maximize Arpu (average revenue per user) is very important. Driving penetration of data is a very important piece; we have seen a slowdown in last six months. We have put in a bunch of initiatives in the last three months and we see some early signs of success.ALSO READ | Airtel to combat Reliance Jio on price, bundling and cost front: CEO Gopal VittalThe metric we chase is our revenue market share (RMS) because we believe that RMS is the only metric that determines if customers are giving you a higher share of their wallets. And in the last one year, the highest increase we have seen is an almost 1.5% growth in market share and the incremental revenue that is generated in a year, we got about 50% of that last year.The long answer to your short question is, its not about the next three or six months, it is really about continuing to drive this passionately because we have seen competitors come and go. I mean in the last 10 years, its been a brutally competitive industry. There used to be 13 players and many players were operating at half the pricing of what we are operating at. We have had bumps, ups and downs on the road, it is not that every year has been great. We have had years where we have actually lost market share and then we had to come back. And consequence of losing market share is that you lose everything, revenue and margin, you lose it all. So this is a metric which is very important to us to make sure we are competitive.Why is the slowdown in data happening?I think the barriers to it are many, one is the price of the devicethe difference between a Rs3,000-3,500 phone which is the cheapest device for data and lets say a Rs1,000 device which is a feature phone is still a big deal for many customers. Second is that a lot of customers dont know what to do with the Internet; even if they need it, they dont know how to use it. The other part is that they have a perception that its expensive and there is a perception of value that you need to create. So, its a combination of all of these things. Amongst women, its much lower than men, penetration rate is substantially low even in urban areas, let alone in rural.So, contrary to the perception that Jios entry will boost data consumption, it hasnt really?I think there is a difference between penetration and consumption. Consumption will continue to grow. As pricing comes down, people use a lot. I think in the long term, penetration will grow, there is no question about it. I am just saying that this is an important piece that we should acknowledge, do a bunch of things to actually shape it.  Do you think what Jio is doing is sustainable?I think it is sustainable. Ultimately, its got linked to revenue. To that extent, they have chosen to play in a certain way, which is good and bold. Hopefully, it works for them.But the strategy that they have come out with, has the industry seen similar strategies before?Firstly, you have not seen that. You have seen one of the players who operates in six circles, who operates in voice pricing, which is 50-60% lower, which is Telenor. There again, they have bundles. At certain price points (for voice), speak as much as you want. That we have seen. They also have very simple tariff plans, which has worked for them, but they have come under some pressure in terms of whats happening in the context of the industry. How will you assess the impact of Jio? I would say they are certainly going to stay. You would see consolidation in the market. Even today, you have eight players; and in the next three years, you may see four players. Thats a good thing.From our position, it would come back to whether we have spectrum assets, capex and financial wherewithal to invest in the network and the answer to that is, yes.How do you see the data and voice play turning out in the coming quarters? We have seen erosion in both voice as well as data. Data has been more secular. It has been growing year on year. I think the data tariff erosion is okay as long as we get data-driven revenue growth. What we have seen most recently is revenue growth softening. Part of that is on account of free services because there are people who want to try it for free.On voice, we have seen elasticity. We have seen strong growth on volumes and erosion on tariff for us. Voice revenue growth has been pretty good. Last quarter we had 9-10% growth, which is reasonably good. We will see some softening of this growth because of free services being offered and some point when they get priced in, we will come back and look at how do we respond to that.Which of the twodata or voicewill have more growth?In India, the average use of minutes is 415 or 420. It is among the highest in the world. The only market which is higher is the US because you have voice free in all their plans. But the pricing starts $40-$50. So, there it is 50% higher. There is a finite limit to how much I want to speak to the other person. That will see more secular growth. On data, sky is the limit because you can do everything through the Internet. Do you see a point where voice can be made completely free like you said about the US?I think there will be a duality to the market. Voice will be free when someone is paying for the data. If everything is free, then we are not having this conversation. But if you are making something free, then you have to charge something else. So, the key question that comes out is, how much Arpu do you get? I think there will be a set of customers who will demand that through bundles. So, that will happen. Will that happen all across the market? I dont think so. I think there will still be some amount of duality in the market.So, you do not see a tipping point for making voice free?Even today, we are doing it. The 1599 price has come down to 999. At 999, voice is free with a bundle of data. But, people are paying for the package. Whether I am paying for voice or data, it does not really matter. I am paying for the aggregate. If that numbers comes down then the question is for competing whats the price you want to compete at? Thats a stroke of the pen decision. This market is complex and nuanced enough that you cant do a call and odd approach. It is not this or that. You have to play together because the scale that we have, the number of customers we serve, we will have to play them together. This is true for the industry: 20% of customers give you 50-60% of your revenue. This is true for all categories. Does that mean that 40-50% of the revenue is not important? No. It is absolutely important but we will have to find the right cost to serve them. So, thats where the and comes in. You have to do both. For a new entrant, it is easier because you will say I will only operate like this. In the context of planned investments by Jio and Vodafone, how do you look to fund your expansion? We generate close to Rs. 15,000-16,000  crore of cash on an annual basis. Our net debt to EBITDA is 2.2, which is very comfortable and very competitive with the best run telcos around the world. So whether you look at it from the spectrum perspective, or rolling out capex a year and half in advance, or brand in terms of who owns 4G today, or best broadband experience or whether its our customer base of 260 million, in all respects we are in a solid position. But from a financial position, the fact is that this industry is in deep debt and the return on capital of the entire industry is less than 1%, which is really low. Even for us as a leading player, we earn just 8% which is no different than a fixed deposit. So that is the function of the humongous cost of spectrum that we have purchased and some of that was a function of what happened in 2014, where we did the renewals. Where we were actually forced to buy, there was not enough spectrum and so if we didnt buy we would be forced out of business and we may have overpaid because of the design of that auction. What is your road map on cutting down the debt? We have just announced a process with a proposed significant stake sale of Infratel. A committee of directors has been appointed, they will look into it, study it and look at all the options on the table for the board.

				The Deen Dayal field is GSPCs primary asset, located off the coast of Andhra Pradesh.GSPC  approached ONGC to sell a stake in the Deen Dayal field earlier this year. GSPC is the operator of the block with 80% participating interest in it. On 25 September, the ONGC board approved  a preliminary agreement to buy this stake.If ONGC decides to acquire our block, we will have to undertake a restructuring to keep it separate. We will be taking a decision on the legal and financial viability of this after ONGCs decision on acquisition, said one of the two people mentioned above, a senior GSPC official.In an email, GSPC said that the proposed transaction between GSPC and ONGC is at a nascent stage and it is not possible to comment on either the timeline for completion, deal structure, valuation or use of proceeds.GSPC is the flagship company of the GSPC Group, involved in exploration and production (E&P) of oil and gas. The government of Gujarat owns 87% of the companys equity capital.In August, Mint reported that consulting firm EY has been appointed to value GSPCs onshore blocks. The exercise is aimed at finding out whether it is possible to induct a strategic and technical partner by farming out a part of GSPCs participating interest and improve the performance of the producing onshore blocks. GSPC has undertaken a business restructuring exercise to improve its credit profile.GSPC holds a participating interest in 24 blocks of which 20 are onshore, and four are offshore. Of the 20 blocks, 17 are  producing blocks.We intend to transfer our major E&P portfolio to GSPC Offshore Ltd and the rest of the business portfolio to GSPC Energy Ltd. However, the finality of this would depend on various statutory and government approvals which are still pending, J.N. Singh, chairman and managing director, GSPC Group, said in an emailed response on 20 September.GSPC has invested $3.5 billion (approximately Rs20,000 crore) in the Deen Dayal field and taken on about Rs19,500 crore of debt. Though it started test production from the block in 2014, it is yet to begin commercial output.A deal with ONGC will reduce its debt burden of nearly Rs20,000 crore as of December 2015.GSPC has been trying to sell a majority stake in the block to ONGC to avoid defaulting on loans. ONGC initially was not keen, but subseque-ntly said it would evaluate the block.GSPC is a government company and would not want to default on the loan payment. The realization from the stake sale to ONGC will be used to retire debt, said the second person cited above.In April, the Comptroller and Auditor General said GSPC had mismanaged its exploration and development-related activities in its KG basin and overseas assets, leading to higher costs and financial losses.In 2015-16, GSPC incurred a net loss of Rs804.42 crore as it wrote off exploration expenditure. It recorded income from operations of Rs10,607.30 crore on a stand-alone basis, compared with Rs10,946,30 crore the previous year.",2016-11-02,sFfAu7UD63fbfA5AkdjecK,"GSPC  had approached ONGC to sell a stake in the Deen Dayal field, GSPCs primary asset, earlier this year",00:02,GSPC may hive off Deen Dayal field to ONGC to avoid loan default
415,0.249875,"Have you seen sci-fi movies like A.I. Artificial Intelligence, a 2001 US science fiction drama directed by Steven Spielberg that portrays a childlike android programmed to love, or Bicentennial Man, which starred the late Robin Williams and was based on a 1976 novel by Isaac Asimov? Have you seen the movie Surrogates which starred Bruce Willis and portrayed a futuristic world where people live within the safety of their homes while their robotic surrogates carry on their daily chores?
				   
				If yes, you are also likely to believe that machines endowed with artificial intelligence (AI) can emulate, or even surpass, human intelligence. However, nothing can be further from the truth, say researchers. At least not till date.The frightening, futurist portrayals of artificial intelligence that dominate films and novels, and shape the popular imagination, are fictional Unlike in the movies, there is no race of superhuman robots on the horizon or probably even possible, insists a Stanford University-hosted report. Titled Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030, this year-long investigation is the first of a series of reports to be published at regular intervals as part of a 100-year study on AI. While the rate of progress in AI has been patchy and unpredictable, there have been significant advances since the fields inception 60 years ago In reality, AI is already changing our daily lives, almost entirely in ways that improve human health, safety, and productivity, the report added.AI has undoubtedly risen like a phoenix from the ashes of the so-called AI wintera period of time in the late 1970s and early 1980s when funding dwindled and research almost went underground. Peter Stone, a computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin and chair of the 17-member panel of international experts who wrote the Stanford report, says he and the panel believe that specialized AI applications will become both increasingly common and more useful by 2030, improving our economy and quality of life... But this technology will also create profound challenges, affecting jobs and incomes and other issues that we should begin addressing now to ensure that the benefits of AI are broadly shared.The Stanford report traces its roots to a 2009 study that brought AI scientists in a process of introspection that became ongoing in 2014, when Eric and Mary Horvitz created the AI100 endowment through Stanford. It investigates eight domains (see more at the end of this article) of human activity in which AI technologies are beginning to affect urban life in ways that will become increasingly pervasive and profound by 2030.Computer vision and AI planning, for example, drive the video games that are now a bigger entertainment industry than Hollywood, notes the report. Deep learning, a form of machine learning based on layered representations of variables referred to as neural networks, has made speech-understanding practical on our phones and in our kitchens, and its algorithms can be applied widely to an array of apps that rely on pattern recognition. Natural language processing, and knowledge representation and reasoning, according to the report, have enabled a machine to beat the Jeopardy champion and are bringing new power to Web searches.While impressive, these technologies are highly tailored to particular tasks. Each application typically requires years of specialized research and careful, unique construction. In similarly targeted apps, substantial increases in the future uses of AI technologies including more self-driving cars, healthcare diagnostics and targeted treatments, and physical assistance for care of elders can be expected.But what exactly is AI?Curiously, the lack of a precise, universally accepted definition of AI probably has helped the field to grow, blossom, and advance at an ever-accelerating pace, says the Stanford report.According to the study panel, Nils J. Nilsson has provided a useful definition: Artificial intelligence is that activity devoted to making machines intelligent, and intelligence is that quality that enables an entity to function appropriately and with foresight in its environment. Nilsson is Kumagai professor of engineering (emeritus) in the department of computer science at Stanford University and one of the founding researchers in the discipline of AI. The late John McCarthy, an American computer and cognitive scientist who coined the term AI in 1955, defined it as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.AI adopts an interdisciplinary approach. Other than computer science, AI also relies on subjects like math, psychology, linguistics, philosophy and neuroscience. Its growth has been triggered by the maturation of machine learning, stimulated in part by the rise of the digital economy, which both provides and leverages large amounts of data, according to the Stanford report. Other factors include the rise of cloud computing resources and consumer demand for widespread access to services such as speech recognition and navigation support.Machine learning has been propelled dramatically forward by impressive empirical successes of artificial neural networks, which can now be trained with huge data sets and large-scale computing. This approach has been come to be known as deep learning. The leap in the performance of information processing algorithms has been accompanied by significant progress in hardware technology for basic operations such as sensing, perception, and object recognition. New platforms and longer term, AI may be thought of as a radically different mechanism for wealth creation in which everyone should be entitled to a portion of the worlds AI-produced treasures, says the report.AI experts predict that intelligent and semi-intelligent autonomous systems such as self-driving cars and autonomous drones will march into our society in the next two-three years, according to a 6 February briefing at the 2016 American Association for the Advancement of Science Annual Meeting.To be sure, major research universities devote departments to AI studies, and technology companies already spend heavily to explore AI applications they regard as critical to their futures.On 28 September, for instance, Google Inc.-owned DeepMind Technologies Ltd, Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corp. and IBM Corp. said they will create a non-profit organization that will work to advance public understanding of AI technologies and formulate best practices on the challenges and opportunities within the field. Academics, non-profits, and specialists in policy and ethics will be invited to join the board of the organization, named the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society (Partnership on AI).The objective of the Partnership on AI is to address opportunities and challenges with AI technologies to benefit people and society. Besides conducting research, recommending best practices, and publishing research under an open licence in areas such as ethics, fairness and inclusivity; transparency, privacy and interoperability; collaboration between people and AI systems; and the trustworthiness, reliability and robustness of the technology, the organizations founding members will each contribute financial and research resources to the partnership and will share leadership with independent third-parties, including academics, user group advocates, and industry domain experts.On 29 September, Microsoft announced the formation of a new Microsoft AI and Research Group, bringing together over 5,000 computer scientists and engineers focused on the companys AI product efforts. The new group will be led by computer vision expert Harry Shum, a 20-year Microsoft veteran whose career has spanned leadership roles across Microsoft Research and Bing engineering. Several of Microsofts engineering leaders and teams will join the newly formed group, including those from the Information Platform, Cortana and Bing, and Ambient Computing and Robotics units. Effectively, the Microsoft AI and Research Group will encompass AI product engineering, basic and applied research labs, and New Experiences and Technologies.According to Satya Nadella, chief executive of Microsoft, this newly formed unit will help Microsoft focus on empowering both people and organizations, by democratizing access to intelligence to help solve our most pressing challenges, for which we are infusing AI into everything we deliver across our computing platforms and experiences.Microsoft is adopting a four-pronged approach to its initiative to democratize AI. The first involves harnessing AI to fundamentally change human and computer interaction through agents such as Microsofts digital personal assistant Cortana. The second is about infusing every appfrom the photo app on peoples phones to Skype and Office 365with intelligence.The third focuses on making these intelligent capabilities that are infused in Microsofts appscognitive capabilities such as vision and speech, and machine analyticsavailable to every app developer in the world. The fourth strategy revolves around building the worlds most powerful AI supercomputer with Azure and making it available to anyone, to enable people and organizations to harness its power.Facebook AI Research, according to a November 2015 note by Mike Schroepfer, chief technology officer at the social network firm, has been conducting ambitious research in areas like image recognition and natural language understanding with developments in a new technology called Memory Networks that add a type of short-term memory to the convolutional neural networks that power the deep-learning systems, allowing those systems to understand language more like a human would.In March,  DeepMinds computer programme, AlphaGo, beat Go champion Lee Seedol once again, triggering a deep-seated fear about the prowess of AI-driven bots. On the flip side, Microsofts AI chatbot Tay turned racist and sexist within 24 hours, forcing the company to issue an apology and take Tay offline. Microsoft, though, does have a chatbot called XiaoIce in China, which it claims is being used by about 40 million people.On 6 October, Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd announced it has agreed to acquire Viv Labs Inc., which has developed an AI platform that gives third-party developers the power to use and build conversational assistants and integrate a natural language-based interface into renowned apps and services. The deal underscores the companys penchant for virtual personal assistants and is part of its broader vision to deliver an AI-based open ecosystem across all its devices and services.Will AI machines surpass us?Such developments do give the impression that machines will soon become more intelligent than us. But we are not beaten yethuman skills are still superior in some areas, concludes a recent study by Danish physicist Jacob Sherson, published in science journal Nature. Sherson and his research group at Aarhus University, according to a 13 April statement, have identified one of the abilities that still makes humans unique compared to a computers enormous processing powerour skill in approaching problems heuristically and solving them intuitively.Technology luminaries such as Bill Gates, Elon Musk, even physicist Stephen Hawking, have expressed fear that robots with AI could rule mankind. But there are those who believe that AI machines can be controlled. Marvin Lee Minsky, who died in January, was an American cognitive scientist in the field of AI and co-founder of MITs AI laboratory. A champion of AI, he did believe that some computers would eventually become more intelligent than most human beings, but hoped that researchers would make such computers benevolent to mankind.On the other hand, Raymond Ray Kurzweil, an American author, computer scientist, inventor and futurist, in his 2006 book The Singularity is Near, predicted, among many other things, that AI will surpass humans, the smartest and most capable life forms on the planet. By 2099, he forecast that machines would have attained equal legal status with humans. However, Ray has sought to allay such fears that smart machines will dominate humans by pointing out that we can deploy strategies to keep emerging technologies like AI safe, and underscoring the existence of ethical guidelines like Isaac Asimovs three laws for robots, which can prevent at least to some extent smart machines from overpowering us (Should we fear AI?).So will these intelligent machines rule over humans?The answer to this question, however, is not easy because much will depend on how you approach, or address, the issue. The Stanford report concludes: Over the next several years, AI research, systems development, and social and regulatory frameworks will shape how the benefits of AI are weighed against its costs and risks, and how broadly these benefits are spread.What the Stanford AI report saysAutonomous cars, trucks and, possibly, aerial delivery vehicles may alter how we commute, work and shop, and create new patterns of life and leisure in cities.Home/service robots like robotic vacuum cleaners already in some homes and specialized robots will clean and provide security in living/work spaces. They will be equipped with sensors and remote controls.Healthcare devices to monitor personal health and robot-assisted surgery are hints of things to come if AI is developed in ways that gain the trust of doctors, nurses, patients and regulators.Interactive tutoring systems already help students learn languages, math and other skills. More is possible if technologies like natural language processing platforms develop to augment instruction by humans.The conjunction of content creation tools, social networks and AI will lead to new ways to gather, organize and deliver media in engaging, personalized and interactive ways.Investments in uplifting technologies like predictive models to prevent lead poisoning or improve food distribution could spread AI benefits to the underserved.Cameras, drones and software to analyse crime patterns should use AI in ways that reduce human bias and enhance safety without loss of liberty or dignity.Work should start now on how to help people adapt as the economy undergoes rapid changes as many existing jobs are lost and new ones are created.Source: Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030",2016-11-02,w2pku8z1u69nY9mVRp6rUM,Your fortnightly guide to how cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence will shape lives and businesses,01:29,"Artificial Intelligence is coming of age, slowly but surely"
75,0.24785,"With the addition of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Code, the Indian lending system has gotten teeth in dealing with stressed borrowers and a difficult macroeconomic situation. As the Indian banking system stares at a Rs6.3 trillion bad loan pile, with more being added almost every quarter, a legal stress resolution mechanism is the need of the hour.
				   
				As some of the finer points of the Code get clarified, before it takes effect at the end of the year, there is speculation around how it will be implemented in a market like India, which is famously known for its slow resolution rate.At a panel discussion at the Mint conference on Bankruptcy ActImpact of the new law on the banking landscape, held on 24 October, industry professionals, law professionals and stressed asset consultants came together to discuss the Code, and the opportunities and challenges associated with it. As divorce is important for marriage, I think insolvency resolution is important for investments, whether Indian or foreign capital, said Cyril Suresh Shroff, managing partner at Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas. According to Shroff, the impact of the bankruptcy code will be widely positive, leading to a better management of stressed companies in India. M.R. Umarji, a member of the Bankruptcy Law Committee set up by government, believes that while the code bestows significant powers on the legal system to deal with stressed companies, the intended effect is that there will be better financial discipline among companies, which will work to ensure that all their creditors are paid on time. Abizer Diwanji, partner and national leader, financial services and restructuring services, EY India, said, About 70% of our banking business is government-led. They have restraints in the way that they can make rational decisions in a timely manner. The law says that in 270 days there has to be a decision or the company goes into liquidation, but that does not mean that in 270 days there will be a rational decision.Rashesh Shah, chairman and chief executive officer at Edelweiss Finance, is of the view that the lending system in India has entered into yet another zone of conflict between the lenders and the borrowers. According to him, back in the late 80s and early 90s, when infrastructure lenders were faced with high non-performing assets (NPAs), they would convert a significant chunk of their debt into equity and then make huge returns a few years later. Back then, the lenders won the tug of war.In the era of corporate debt restructuring (CDR) and other debt recast mechanisms, lenders have ended up taking haircuts while the equity holders didnt feel much of the pinch. Shah believes that the equity holders or the borrowers had won that round. With the bankruptcy code coming into the picture, the powers have once again come into the hands of lenders as they are far above equity holders in the payout structure that the code mandates in a liquidation situation, said Shah.The bark is more important than the bite. As a practitioner I would never like to get into a situation of resolution under this Act, but I think it is desirable that we would be outside this or before this is invoked, said Vishakha Mulye, executive director, ICICI Bank.As a system, Mulye said, everyone must work together to demonstrate that resolution and liquidation can be done in an effective and efficient manner, if there has to be a future for the bankruptcy code. However, not everyone is convinced that India has done enough to move the stressed asset situation in the right direction.Anurag Das, founder and managing partner at Rain Tree Capital Singapore, is measured in his optimism. Some of the best practices around the world need to come to this market too, he said, adding that a very hands-on approach has to be taken to ensure that a turnaround takes place.According to Das, even though his optimism is measured, the expectation is that in about five years from now, there will be a number of Indian stressed companies where turnaround will take place because of the code.Some flaws in the way that the code is drafted include the fact that lenders too are held at gunpoint in case the resolution plan does not get finalised in the time assigned by the code, according to Rajendra Chitale, managing partner, MP Chitale & Associates.There should be a provision to get extensions if needed, Chitale said, adding that these flaws might have been unintended, but are part of the way bankruptcy play out in the future. Another issue, Chitale points out, is that the law assumes that the resolution plan that is being implemented in the stressed company will work out in the first attempt.  This may lead to an increase in the number of credible assets in the economy which may go into wind-up. Having said that, Chitale believes that the bankruptcy code is a landmark legislation which can change the way business is done in India.",2016-11-02,Ab3yPyjl9xhcHsOJtF2GeK,"At the Mint conference on the Bankruptcy Act, industry professionals, law professionals and stressed asset consultants discuss opportunities and challenges",00:51,Measuring the impact of the Bankruptcy Act
166,0.247075,"New Delhi: With its eyes set on doubling Indias present installed wind power by 2022, the ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE) has revised guidelines for onshore wind power projects. 
				   
				At present (till end-September), India has 28.1 giga watt (GW) of wind power installed capacity across the country and the Central government has set an ambitious target of generating 60GW by 2022. To achieve that target, MNRE believes that the current rate of deployment of wind power capacity is required to be more than doubled. The guidelines were revised to address new-age problems and reduce delays.India first came out with guidelines for development of onshore wind power projects in 1995 to ensure proper growth of the wind power sector. The guidelines were then revised in 1996. Since then, this is the first major revision.The guidelines aim to facilitate development of wind power projects in an efficient, cost effective and environmentally benign manner. They address all major issues like land use permission, availability of wind resource, grid connectivity, transport logistics, environmental acceptability, micrositing, health and safety, hybridization, repowering and decommission plan.The project developer should ensure that the land being selected for the wind power project can be legally used for the purpose and all regulations regarding land use/land cover are complied with, said the guidelines which were issued on 22 October. They clarified that in case of land allotment by the state government for the wind power project, a maximum period of four years may be allowed for development and start of commissioning of the project. But if there is a delay, then the land allotment may be cancelled.To address the issue of grid connectivity, the guidelines said that the project developer should ensure that grid connectivity is technically and commercially feasible at the site selected.If the site being selected falls in the area of forest land or in the vicinity of habitat of migratory birds and their flight routes, civil aviation, defence and heritage establishments the project developer should ensure availability of necessary clearances from concerning authorities, they added.It added that to ensure health and safety of people working/residing near the wind power installations the NIWE (National Institute of Wind Energy) will prescribe criteria for noise and shadow flicker in consultation with stakeholders.The guidelines also stated that a proposal to establish wind power project should necessarily include a decommissioning plan of the wind turbine after completion of its useful life.The NIWE will formulate guidelines for decommissioning of the wind turbines in consultation with stakeholders, it added.As per the MNRE, the need for such guidelines were felt because of advancement in the wind turbine technology, requirement to comply various standards and regulations issued by CEA (Central Electricity Authority) and other regulatory bodies, to address issues related to micrositing, decommissioning, health and safety.For instance, over the past 20 years, the wind turbine technology in India has evolved from less efficient turbines with low capacity of 225 KW to more efficient turbines with high capacity of 3 mega watt being manufactured in India.Indias total installed renewable capacity currently is around 44.2GW and significance of wind power in India can be assumed from the fact it amounts to over 60% of the total installed renewable power. India is globally ranked fourth in terms of wind power installed capacity.",2016-11-02,Ml9Urs18BVl7hvF1geHyrI,The Centre revises guidelines for onshore wind power projects to meet ambitious target of generating 60GW of wind power by 2022,11:06,Onshore wind power project norms revised in boost to Modis clean energy goal
162,0.24905,"Tokyo:  Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs at least $100 billion more to finance countrys goals for clean energy even after his governments policies brought in record investment in wind and solar power stations.
				   
				Thats the conclusion of a report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, which found $10.5 billion flew into renewables in India for the fiscal year ended 31 March, almost 60% more than the $6.6 billion invested two years ago. It also said 7.3 gigawatts of clean-energy projects were built for the latest fiscal year, which is 71% higher than the previous period.The findings represent the broadest assessment yet of the money going into Indias clean-energy industry. Growth in the renewables business has helped India become the third-biggest power market in the world after China and the US, according to the BNEF report. Modi has set a goal of building 175 gigawatts of clean-energy capacity by 2022 to supply more of the 62 million households that lack access to reliable grids and feed demand for electricity thats projected to rise fourfold by 2040.Hes taking the right steps, but the targets are quite ambitious, said Shantanu Jaiswal, the lead author of the report at BNEF. The question is where do people get the money$100 billion is a lot of money for this industry, especially given where were starting from.An investment of $100 billion is equivalent to almost 5% of all the goods and services produced annually by the nation of 1.3 billion people, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Diversified financingThe report, sponsored by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, a US non-profit working to mitigate climate change with renewable energy, was released at BNEFs conference in Shanghai on Tuesday. It also found that India has installed clean-energy capacity of 42.6 gigawatts. That accounts for 14% of the nations total generation capacity, up from 12.5% three years ago.Jaiswal said the nation needs to diversify its sources of finances to reach the goal, bringing in big international banks to complement the lending done by Indias state-backed institutions and the development banks active in the country. It also needs to reduce the cost of debt financing for solar projects, which is more than double the rate charged in China and six times interest rates available in Japan, according to the report.State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank, along with Axis Bank Ltd and Yes Bank Ltd, have helped supply much of the finance along with non-bank lenders such as Tata Cleantech Capital Ltd and L&T Finance Ltd. Development institutions include the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency, the World Banks International Finance Corp., the Asian Development Bank and KFW of Germany.The huge capital needed to meet the targets, as well as the high cost of capital, mean that fundraising from the public markets will be critically important, according to the report. Along with green bonds, India is turning to infrastructure investment trusts, which are used to free up and recycle developers capital stuck in operational projects by securitizing the revenue streams and offering the units on the public market.The arrangement, expected to help the inflow of foreign capital and reduce the exposure of domestic financial institutions, was approved in September 2014 by the Securities and Exchange Board of India. Infrastructure investment trusts are similar to yieldcos in helping developers combine multiple projects.To create safeguards for investors in infrastructure investment trusts, regulators have set a requirement for a minimum number of independent directors in the investment management firm and have also placed restrictions on transactions done between related parties, according to the report.India also needs to improve on the management of power distribution companies, according to BNEFs Jaiswal.Right now, Indias power distribution utilities are in huge debts, so they dont buy power even when theres demand, Jaiswal said.Retailers held total debt of almost Rs.4.1 trillion ($60 billion) at the end of March 2015, Power Minister Piyush Goyal said in August. That leaves the countrys power plants running below capacity, while one in five people go without electricity.

346,0.2485,"Seattle: Microsoft Corp. unveiled a corporate team-chat service that works with its cloud-based Office and Skype products, aiming to take on Slack Technologies Inc. and Atlassian Corp.s HipChat in a growing market.
				   
				The new product is designed to facilitate real-time conversations and collaboration while maintaining and building up that institutional knowledge of a team, said chief executive officer Satya Nadella. The product has team chat, private messages and voice and videoconferencing.Big companies like Microsoft and IBM are showing renewed interest in the corporate-messaging market as customers flock to internet-based tools like Slack for setting up team communications, said Vanessa Thompson, an analyst at IDC. Microsoft relied on Office 365 and other products to rack up almost $10 billion in commercial cloud revenue for the fiscal year that ended 30 June, and is adding services to draw in more customers.Microsoft is trying to get more airtime with customers that might want something to augment their existing investment in Office 365, Thompson said. What we have started to see is a bunch of companies trying to attack the enterprise versions of WhatsApp and consumer messaging. IDC hasnt published a market size or forecast for the space, which it calls workplace application messaging.A preview of the service, dubbed Microsoft Teams, is available now for Office 365 commercial customers in some versions. It will be generally available in the first quarter and will be included in all Office 365 Enterprise and small business versions.Coordinated tasksMicrosofts product allows teams to add what its calling Tabs, to quickly link to frequently used files and applications. These tabs can relate to Microsoft products like the OneNote note-taking program or to outside productsthe company said its adding support for Zendesk and Asana soon. Teams can also bring in notifications from services like Twitter and GitHub. Like Slack, it also supports the usage of botsprograms that chat with users to automate tasks.Its not Microsofts first foray into this areathe company paid $1.2 billion in 2012 to buy Yammer Inc., but hasnt been able to build up the same kind of usage as Slack and HipChat. Slack raised $200 million at a valuation of $3.8 billion in April. The startup, which introduced its product in 2013, said it reached annualized revenue of $100 million over the summer and surpassed 1.25 million paid users. HipChat was founded in 2010 and acquired by Atlassian two years later. That company declined to break out specific numbers for the product.Microsoft said Teams tight connection with Office and ability to do more than chat give it an advantage over rivals, some of which integrate with parts of Office, but not as closely.Just creating another persistent chat tool isnt all that interesting, said Office vice president Kirk Koenigsbauer. The notion of having this hub for teamwork is a new spin on it. Its not for people who just want to have conversations.Race dayNascar racing company Hendrick Motorsports has been trying out Teams and will use it on the track at the Daytona 500 in February, said Matt Cochran, the companys information technology manager. During a race, Hendrick will use Microsofts product to coordinate pit stops and share feedback among teams supporting its four cars. For example, if one car is seeing a certain kind of wear on tires its crew can alert the other three, which have similar equipment, to make adjustments. Chat is important because the crews need information quickly while audio channels of communications are reserved for conversations between the driver and the crew chief.Hendrick was using Slack, but will switch because Teams works more smoothly with the firms existing Microsoft software and has better security, Cochran said.Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft considered acquiring Slack, but the discussions never got serious enough to involve Nadella or the companys board, and it opted instead to build its own similar software, said two people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the process wasnt public. TechCrunch reported Microsofts potential interest in Slack in March.In a very tongue-in-cheek acknowledgment of the competition, Slack took out a full-page ad in the New York Times Wednesday and posted a copy on its website welcoming Microsoft to the field and noting that all this is harder than it looks.Atlassian president Jay Simons said HipChat has an advantage by focusing purely on communicating, while Microsoft Teams is another feature intended to sell Office 365 subscriptions.The success Atlassian has had in focusing on teams has probably been a wake-up call to Microsoft, he said. On one level, you welcome the competition but on the other level, Microsoft is always a little scary because its a huge company with a lot of customers.Bloomberg Beta, the venture capital arm of Bloomberg LP, is an investor in Slack.

Rajapur is a city in the Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra, around 385km from Mumbai. The OMCsIndian Oil Corp. Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL)plan to jointly build a 60 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) refinery at a cost of Rs1.5 trillion in two phases of 40 and 20 mtpa.The piece of land identified is exactly what we wanted. It is near a potential port and around 14,000 acres. We recently received a confirmation from the Maharashtra government that they have found the required land. Now MIDC (Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation) will go ahead with the acquisition of this land, said the first of the officials cited earlier. Emails sent to the three OMCs on 28 October remained unanswered. The second of the officials added that the land identified is only for the refinery. We still need some piece of land to set up a jetty and a desalination plant for captive water supply. So we are looking for land for that, he said.Mint had reported in September that the OMCs and the state government were finding it difficult to find 15,000 acres of contiguous land in the Konkan region for the complex. Government officials had asked the OMCs to reduce the land requirement. The first official cited earlier said around 20-30% of the land parcel identified is rocky and the OMCs may need to invest Rs10,000-15,000 crore to flatten this portion of land. However, we are happy that the land that has been finalized, he added. The OMCs will form a special purpose vehicle for the project. While Indian Oil will hold a 50% stake, HPCL and BPCL will hold 25% each. The official said they are keen on bringing in a strategic partner in the project and may rework the equity structure post that. Some international partners have shown interest in the project but they will participate only after we have some concrete plans in place (for the refinery) to present to them, said the official. Pradhan had said on 6 June that the refinery had been offered to Saudi Aramco as a prospective partner.The OMCs have finalized the configuration and petrochemical linkages that the refinery will have. The government has appointed Engineers India Ltd as the technical agency to prepare a detailed feasibility report (DFR). The two OMC officials added that with the identification of the piece of land, the DFR can now be commissioned and that the report may take 8-10 months to prepare. Besides, the process for environmental approvals, deliberations on financing options, tax concessions and various board approvals can be put in place now. An analyst with a domestic brokerage said, India has been an exporter of petroleum products and its existing refineries are also being further expanded. Though the countrys own demand for petro products is growing at a fast pace and there is infrastructure development happening, it remains to be seen how far we will be able to absorb additional supply (of products).",2016-11-03,mcGavvC8r4wdBuQE8a4jyO,"Oil marketing firms, Maharashtra government have been looking for land for the project for the past 10 months",02:07,Rs1.5 trillion refinery complex to be set up in Rajapur
352,0.2454,"Jindal India Thermal Power Ltd (JITPL), a part of the BC Jindal group, is in talks with prospective buyers to sell its 1,200MW thermal power plant in Odisha, three people familiar with the development said.
				   
				The plant in Odishas Angul district has so far received competing offers from Singapores SembCorp, Adani Power and JSW Energy, one of the three people cited above said, requesting anonymity.The sell side mandate was given to EY around three months ago following which SembCorp has made an upfront cash offer of close to Rs1,600 crore for the equity component of the project, said the person cited above.JSW and Adani have offered a higher price of more than Rs2,000 crore, but the offer involves an upfront cash payment of around Rs500 crore to Rs600 crore towards equity and the remaining upon fulfilment of certain conditions linked to singing of power purchase agreements and coal linkages, the person said.JSW is keen to replicate the same structure it followed while buying JSPLs (Naveen Jindal-led Jindal Steel and Power Ltds) 1,000MW thermal unit this year, where it paid Rs500 crore cash advance while tying up the rest of the payment to pre-defined conditions regarding fuel security and power offtake, the person added. Emails sent to Adani group, SembCorp and EY did not elicit any response at the time of going to press.A JSW Energy spokesperson denied that the company is in talks to buy the asset.Your query is completely speculative and baseless. The company reiterates that there is no truth and categorically deny any discussion by JSW Energy with them, the spokesperson said.JITPL is controlled by listed firms Jindal Poly Investments Ltd (JPIL) and Jindal Photo Ltd (JPL) through Jindal India Powertech Ltd, a holding company owned by JPIL and JPL.The promoters have been in talks to sell the unit in the past too, but a deal did not materialize due to valuation mismatches. However, things are likely to be different this time because JITPL needs some immediate cash infusion to pay lenders and is already behind its repayment schedule, the second person said, also declining to be named.Also, a section of minority shareholders want the promoters to divest from power and focus on the core poly films business, the person added.An email sent to JITPL and BC Jindal group did not receive a response.The Angul project was completed at a cost of Rs7,537 crore with overall debt of Rs5,900 crore and an equity of Rs1,637 crore.Industry analysts said that if the SembCorp offer is accepted, JIPL and JPL could get Rs600 crore and Rs160 crore, respectively, of the proceeds and another Rs685 crore to Jindal Poly Films Ltd, the listed operating entity of the group.JITPL currently has long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) for 256MW capacity (156MW with Odisha Gridco and 100MW with Kerala State Electricity Board Ltd) and has also executed a 12-year PPA with Tata Power Trading Corp. Ltd (TPTCL) for a capacity of up to 900MW at a guaranteed base tariff of Rs2.70 per unit.Concerns over fuel supplies, high interest cost and absence of long-term PPAs among thermal power producers in India has led to distress among several power companies and has led to many assets changing hands.In July, Sajjan Jindal-promoted JSW signed a definitive agreement to acquire Jaiprakash Power Ventures 500MW thermal plant at Bina in Madhya Pradesh at base enterprise value of Rs2,700 crore. In April last year, Adani Power completed the acquisition of Lanco Infratechs Udupi Power plant for Rs6,300 crore, one of the largest takeovers in the countrys thermal power space.Mint on 19 October also reported about SembCorps ongoing talks with GMR group for a possible acquisition of GMR Chhattisgarh Energy Ltd, a unit of GMR Energy Ltd with 1,370MW generation capacity.",2016-11-03,mwehR8tSyF72OMTd4vwfnO,"Concerns over fuel supplies and high interest cost, etc., have led to distress among several power firms, leading to many assets changing hands",00:45,"Adani, JSW and SembCorp in race to buy BC Jindal groups Odisha power plant"
366,0.24775,"Mumbai/New Delhi: Global oil majors BP Plc and Rosneft PJSC are eyeing a piece of Indias $117 billion retail market for fossil fuels, threatening to shake up government-owned companies that have faced little competition for a decade.
				   
				BP has already secured licenses to open as many as 3,500 fuel stations in the worlds second most-populous nation. Rosneft gained access to about 2,700 pumps through last months acquisition of Essar Oil Ltd, which has plans to add 2,600 more outlets. Along with Reliance Industries Ltd and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, the private players will try to chip away at the dominant position of three state-owned enterprises that control 90% of market volume.Competition is expected to intensify with the entry and expansion of private players and multinational companies, said Rahul Prithiani, a Mumbai-based director at CRISIL, a unit of S&P Global Ratings. Private players and multinational companies are expected to increase their market share though government companies will probably still dominate given their vast network of fuel retailing stations, he said.Retail sales have become more viable for private-sector refiners ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modis government scrapped diesel-price controls two years ago. Pricing freedom coupled with record oil consumption as the number of trucks, cars and motorbikes multiply is helping India stand out as a country that global oil majors cant ignore.The Paris-based International Energy Agency predicts India will be the worlds fastest-growing oil consuming nation through 2040.This sort of growth they will not get anywhere, said Lalit Kumar Gupta, chief executive officer of Essar Oil. Europe is virtually saturated, there is hardly any growth. In the US there is tough competition. India is the only country which is growing and which is growing by a big number and they feel there is scope.Companies including Saudi Aramco and Frances Total SA have shown an interest in India, while existing players such as Shell are planning to expand their footprint, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said in June, flagging further reforms in the oil and gas sector. More fuel retailers will increase competition and benefit consumers, he said.This is Indias second attempt at deregulation. Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries had captured 14% of retail diesel sales and 7% of petrol sales in 2006, after the government deregulated prices more than a decade back. The company had to close down pumps after price caps were re-introduced.The October 2014 deregulation is an opportunity for Reliance Industries to re-enter the retail market and ramp up volumes, according to the companys latest annual report. RIL plans to launch aggressive customer acquisition programs to quickly regain targeted market share, it said.Reliance Industries has re-secured over 4.5% of sales to bulk users of diesel, such as railways and state-operated bus services, the company said. It has opened about 1,100 stations so far, with plans to increase the number to 1,400 by March.Rising consumptionIndias fuel demand grew 11%in the year ended 31 March, the fastest pace in records going back to fiscal 2001. Consumption expanded 8% in the first half of the financial year that started 1 April, according to the oil ministrys Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell.BP sees a strong future for transportation fuels in India, the British oil major said in an emailed statement last week. We are keen to be involved in this market and contribute to its development.Still, private players have a long battle on their hands given the dominating position of the three government-owned companies, Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd, which together operate almost 53,000 fuel stations in India.If we compare with 10 years ago when private players had come, since then the state-run oil marketing companies are much better prepared, said Sanjiv Singh, head of refineries at Indian Oil, the countrys biggest fuel retailer. It will definitely bring in efficiency. The challenge before us is that while private players target the very-prime market, our commitment is to feed the total market.International companies may first make a dent in the large-scale industrial and commercial market, since public-sector companies have established themselves at prime locations for fuel pumps, Vikas Halan, vice president at Moodys Investors Service, said by phone.Thats where the competition heats up with the foreign players, he said.

247,0.24995,"New Delhi: The annual Yes Bank Transformation Series in which Mint is a knowledge partner, is focused this year on innovation and impact as the key drivers of growth and productivity. Designing a solution to redefine Indias solar energy market to conceptualizing an ecosystem for Indias fintech start-ups or laying the road map for a cashless Indian economy, these are some of the case study challenges provided by this years contest for teams from B-schools in India and across the world.
				   
				Launched in 2010, the Yes Bank Transformation Series is a unique platform that offers students across the world an opportunity to work on real-life industry challenges faced by the financial sector and urges them to push the envelope, in a bid to transform Innovation to Impact. Over the years, the focus has been on various disruptive concepts such as digital financial inclusion and complete digitalization. So far, more than 35,000 students have participated in this challenge, making it Indias largest case study challenge.Rana Kapoor, managing director and chief executive of Yes Bank, said: At Yes Bank, it is our constant endeavour to interact with the young minds and channelize their entrepreneurial spirit in the right direction with an emphasis on Innovation. The Yes Bank Transformation Series is a great opportunity for aspiring students to put themselves in the shoes of business leaders, test their mettle against the world and showcase their innovative thinking. I strongly believe that this case study challenge will help us find the next big thinkers and innovators of the country.The Yes Bank Transformation Series is an attempt towards nurturing and promoting the talent inherent in the brightest young minds of the country, while also infusing the spirit of DICE: Design, Innovation and Creativity-led Entrepreneurship in them. The central idea is establishing a nationwide Innovation Lab that would create a sustained culture of growth, entrepreneurship and innovation in India. The challenge has seen the series climb new heights this year, with participation from more than 25,000 students across the top B-schools of India including Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ahmedabad; IIM, Calcutta; IIM, Lucknow; IIM, Indore; Indian School of Business (ISB), Hyderabad; Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT); National Institute of Industrial Engineering (NITIE), Mumbai; IIM, Kozhikode; and IIM, Shillong among others. In this edition, the Yes Bank Transformation Series has emerged as Indias largest case study challenge for B-school students. Using a mix of digital and social media and with a strong focus on innovation, the competition engaged with more than 300,000 students from across the world.Innovative use of social mediaOne of the unique aspects of the fifth edition of the Yes Bank Transformation Series was the innovative use of social and digital media to interact and engage with the student community. The core idea was to reach and engage young minds in the language they converse inat the places they frequent the mostsocial media.The campaign spread across Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn and helped facilitate interactions with more than 300,000 students across the world.Coming up on social mediaMeet your mentor: This will provide an opportunity for budding entrepreneurs to interact with the advisory council via Twitter chats and LinkedIn and get live answers to their queries.Innovation focus: An awareness campaign to highlight the key disruptive innovations in financial services industry that redefined the boundaries of the industry.Innovation Quiz: This quiz on disruptive innovation and the questions will focus solely around innovations which changed the facets of the industry in which they were conceived.Prelims of Edition V of Yes Bank Transformation Series: The preliminary round saw four diverse organizations addressing four key issues in the fintech space. Taisys Technologies, an organization which in collaboration with Yes Bank has created a unique solution which enables feature phone users to access essential banking services, T-Hub, Indias largest incubator, which is creating a comprehensive centre of excellence to accelerate and scale-up fintech start-ups with Yes Bank, Zaggle Prepaid Ocean Services Pvt. Ltd, a prepaid solution provider, and Ezetap Mobile Solutions Pvt. Ltd, one of the worlds largest mobile point of sale (m-PoS) solution providers, shared their challenges with students around the world.In this round, the top participating institutions were divided into four groups, each addressing one of the aforementioned case studies. Here is a bit about the case studies: TaisysThe case from Taisys focused on the Sim-Se-pay solution launched by Taisys with Yes Banka wafer-thin sticker which can be stuck on any type of SIM card of any telco service providerstandard, micro and nano. This sticker installs a sim tool kit-based app which can be accessed by the consumer on any mobile phone without the need for Internet connection.This Sim-Se-Pay wafer is linked to a prepaid wallet which can be loaded by the consumer to perform various types of transactions. The case challenged students to work on increasing commercial usages and socio-commercial usages of the SIM Sleeve and create a comprehensive marketing strategy for the same.T-HubThe second case focused on the unique public/private partnership between T-Hub, the government of Telangana, three of Indias premier academic institutes (IIIT-H, ISB and NALSAR) and key private sector leaders. It stands at the intersection of the start-up, academic, corporate, research and government sectors, and Yes Bank.In April 2016, Yes Bank signed a memorandum of understanding  with T-Hub to create a centre of excellence (CoE), to enable the Indian start-ups across segments with primary focus on fintech. This association will help create a conducive business environment and support system for a large number of fintech start-ups. In addition, Yes Bank will offer its various products and payment gateways and open application program interfaces (APIs) to the start-up community. This challenge tasked the worlds finest minds to create an innovation strategy to leverage the relationship between Yes Bank and T-Hub and to create a holistic innovation program for fintech start-ups, as well as to create a detailed marketing strategy and implementation programme to promote the CoE initiative in a cluttered and highly competitive market.Zaggle In case 3, the focus shifted to Zaggle one of Indias fastest growing prepaid card companies with over 1,000 corporates and 600,000 cards (Visa/Master/proprietary platform) in circulation.Yes Bank and Zaggle have entered into an association to offer prepaid cards to Yes Bank customers. Zaggle has aligned itself with Yes Bank as a total solution provider for its prepaid instruments services across India. This collaboration formally marked Zaggles first engagement with Yes Bank to issue prepaid gift cards and subsequently follow it up with other prepaid cards and allied products with respect to digital payments. This collaboration with Yes Bank would enable Zaggle to further cement its position as a leader in the digital payments space.The case challenged the students to device a cashless innovative pre-paid solution for individuals, giving employers a hassle free product construct and the recipient a potent solution with a wide bouquet of options along with a focused marketing strategy.EzetapThere has been much talk about the gradual shift to a cashless society and the fourth case in the Yes Bank Transformation Series focused on that. This case was shared by Ezetapthe fastest growing mPoS company in India today. Since launching in 2011, Ezetap has over 80,000 terminals deployed in the market, processing over $2.5 million in gross transaction value daily.Despite the phenomenal growth of mobile wallet and m-PoS providers in the country, there is a still major reliance on cash transactions (almost 94% transactions are cash-based). Bright young minds across the world were tasked with devising a strategic road map for Ezetap to tap this huge potential market (there is a potential of 19-20 million PoS  terminals in India while currently only around a million exist). Students were also advised to integrate the revolutionary UPIUnified Payment Interface technology.Campus connectAfter a gruelling opening round, the top five teams were identified by senior leaders from the partner organizations and Yes Bank leaders. The Yes Bank Transformation Series hosted campus challenges across the top 25 campuses in the country to identify the 15 finalist teams of the challenge. The campus round saw students ideas being judged on criteria such as research methodology, understanding of current regulatory framework, depth of analysis of core issues, innovation quotient, and feasibility of implementation and scalability.Apart from naming the winners and runners-up in the campus round, additional prizes were given away for the most innovative idea, most implementable solution, best marketing plan, and Y-Star presenter. This year saw a number of online engagements that generated a huge buzz in the student community. For instance, prior to the campus rounds, teams that submitted their entries before 21 August were eligible for the early-bird submission prize. There was also a Cheatcode Day, through which the top five winners got the opportunity to have their queries addressed by the case-study partner.Students were equally ecstatic about the competition and shared their feedback. Said Janaki Thakkar, student at IIM, Ahmedabad: This year, the theme was around Innovation and National Impact, and the case study we received was a live project Yes Bank was working on. This made the competition appealing, knowing that our work would add value to the organization, and hence we decided to participate. Of course, the attractive prizes helped! Since we worked on a live problem statement at Yes Bank Transformation Series, the competition gave us an opportunity to apply our classroom learnings to real world scenarios. Further, this competition helped us in exploring the current trends across various sectors and keep us informed about recent developments in the business world. While working on this case, we not only looked into developing marketing plan for the target group but also multiple use-cases that would add value to the customers. Says Pramod Suresh of ISB Hyderabad: The transformation series was a challenging competition which required the use of both our left and right brains to arrive at creative yet logical solutions to an actual problem. Yes Bank and T-Hubs brand ensured that there would be stiff competition. The competition exposed us to the accelerator and fintech ecosystem. It also pushed us to think on new disruptive business models. We also got a holistic exposure into various facets of business and also helped polish the soft skills.According to Rashmi Yadawad of IIM, Calcutta: A competition like Yes Bank Transformation Series gives me an opportunity to know about this in detail and stay updated with the current industries and trends. Apart from knowing about current industries and trends, direct interactions with officials from Yes Bank and Ezetap gave me insights from their perspective, a direct picture of what they have already tried. Competing with the campus winners across different B-school campuses will also give me more learnings and the fire to give my best!The grand finaleIn a first-of-its-kind collaboration, the ministry of new and renewable energy, Government of India, shared a challenge focusing on popularizing solar energy with the 15 finalist teams. The final case study will provide a gruelling test to Indias future business leaders. After proving their worth in real-life business cases, the finale takes them to uncharted territories as they pit their wits on a challenge of national importance. The final case challenges finalists to provide innovative financial solutions for solar, or photovoltaic, installations while also creating a strategy for solar consumer products.India is now at a juncture when we must turn to solar to power our future. The government is fully committed to boosting generation and use of solar energy and aims to add 1,00GW of solar power by 2022. The non-polluting nature of solar energy further underlines its status as the most preferred fuel. We must look to integrate solar energy with the lives of the common Indian by making it cheaper, more reliable and easier to connect to grid. High quality research, technological advancements and innovative financing solutions are the means to ensure solar energy becomes affordable and accessible to all. In this regard, I am happy to note that the Yes Bank Transformation Series will see teams from top B-schools in India offering innovative and path breaking ideas regarding the future growth of solar as a medium of energy. I look forward to receiving some valuable insights and suggestions from the sharp young brains and wish them all the best, said A.K. Tripathi, adviser, ministry of new and renewable energy.The grand finale will be held in New Delhi on 16 and 17 November, where the finalists will get to present their ideas to a jury comprising industry experts and mentors. To kick off the final proceedings of the case challenge, Yes Bank will conduct a curtain-raiser on 16 November in New Delhi, where the final 15 teams will get the opportunity to fine-tune their solutions with the advisory council. They will also get to hear the success stories of some of Indias most successful start-up founders as they prepare to start their own quest to entrepreneurship.On 17 November, the teams will present their solutions to the jury, who will pick three winning teams that present the most innovative ideas that can create an impact.

				Some of the worlds largest technology companies are banking on a future where people will send text messages to airlines, banks, restaurants or stores and receive automated responses. Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corp., IBM and Tencent each held events this year centered around promoting their bot-related initiatives to software makers. Twitter Inc. introduced chatbot-like functions with Pizza Hut and other brands on Tuesday to field customer service inquiries.Many are betting these tools will soon be everywhere, with bot avatars for pop stars and mom-and-pop shops. (The band Kiss already has one.) For that bot-filled future to unfold, several startups are hoping to enable anyonenot just software developersto build a bot.The latest is Octane AI, which raised $1.5 million from General Catalyst and other investors. It joins Chatfuel, Olabot and Motion.ai, all of which have either raised money or rolled out their DIY-chatbot tools in the past year. They let people choose from a list of basic commands and edit scripted responses. Some generate revenue through subscriptions.The race among these startups heated up in April, when Facebook made chatbots available to Messengers billion-plus users. Facebook has said there are more than 30,000 chatbots available through its app. In September, Google bought Api.ai, a service that helps developers build bots.Making chatbots accessible to people who cant code is going to be a way a lot of businesses end up building their first few bots, said Phil Libin, a partner at General Catalyst. He compared these nascent bot-building tools with Squarespace Inc. or Wix.com Ltd., which make it easy to build a website.The chatbots you can create with these services are fairly rudimentary. If the bot sees a word or phrase it doesnt recognize or doesnt have an answer for, the conversation hits a dead end. To keep the chatter flowing, many chatbots act like an automated phone system: They nudge users to pick from a small set of responses, displayed as buttons. In most cases, you cant press 0 to get an operator.Its very important to set expectations, said Dmitry Dumik, whose company Chatfuel powers news-delivering chatbots for the New York Times and TechCrunch. You cant have a chatbot like in the movie Her.Octane co-founder Matt Schlicht is optimistic that bots will someday become more useful and benefit from advancements in artificial intelligence. When the iPhone first came out, we had things like the fart app, said Schlicht. Were in the fart app stage with bots.Schlichts startup is targeting brands with loyal followings for its chatbot builder. Octane recently teamed up with 50 Cent to answer messages sent to his Facebook page. The rappers bot can help fans do a few things, such as buying a G-Unit hat or signing up for updates from the musician. If you ask it a question it doesnt know how to answer, the bot simply replies: whats up fam.People message these Facebook pages all the time, and for the most part, no one responds, and the message goes into a black hole, said Schlicht. Its a huge missed opportunity.There are build-your-own chatbot tools that try to replicate dead people, and others that cater to the living. Olabot lets users create a bot version of themselves in minutes just by talking to it. The end result functions as a kind of social profile: Users can link their Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Medium and Spotify accounts, and then answer multiple-choice questions about their interests and views, such as, Would you rather talk about relationships or politics? The goal, according to Olabot CEO Esther Crawford: It should be as easy as creating an Instagram account. Bloomberg",2016-11-03,w1EyIubK0fuxqHzMXKumKP,Some of the worlds largest technology companies are betting on a chatbot future.

233,0.245525,"In 2011, only about 9% of all transactions made using credit and debit cards in India happened at a point of sale (through the swiping of the card at a merchant location), with the remaining 91% being accounted for through ATM withdrawals.
				   
				In August 2016, the latest month for which data is available, this number had risen to 17%. In other words, Indians have gotten significantly more comfortable swiping their credit and debit cards at points of sale in the last five years.There are two factors that have contributed to this trend.First, the use of credit cards (seldom used at ATMs) has gone up in this period. While the absolute number of credit cards in circulation has only gone up by about 50% between April 2011 and August 2016 (from 18 million to 26 million), their usage has increased by nearly a factor of four, from Rs7,100 crore in April 2011 to Rs26,000 crore in August 2016.Looking at it another way, each credit card in circulation was used an average of 1.3 times a month in April 2011, a number that went up to 3.2 times a month in August 2016. Second, the usage patterns of debit cards has changed in the last five years. In April 2011, less than 3% of all debit card transactions (by value) was at a point of sale, while in August 2016, this figure had gone to nearly 8% (by number of transactions, the corresponding figures are 5.3% and 14.7%, respectively).Interestingly, as the usage of debit cards at points of sale has gone up, average per-transaction value of a debit card swipe has actually gone down over time. In other words, people have over time become more comfortable with using debit cards for small transactions.ALSO READ | How to deal with loss of credit/debit cards and online frauds?Coming back to the overall use of credit and debit cards at points of sale (relative to usage at ATMs), the months where Diwali has occurred in the last five years show an interesting pattern.

50,0.242125,"Hong Kong: BlackRock Inc., the worlds largest money manager, said that India is the biggest opportunity for the firm within Asia as it expands lending where banks fear to tread.
				   
				The asset manager is pushing into private credit in the region as unprecedented monetary easing by central banks has weighed on bond market rates. Almost $10 trillion of securities from around the world still offered negative rates at the end of last month and thats spurring investors to seek out alternatives. Lenders are also retreating from extending money to smaller companies, leaving gaps that asset managers in search of yield are looking to fill.Private credit provides an attractive return paradigm for investors in the current low-rate environment, said Neeraj Seth, Singapore-based head of Asian credit at the firm. India is at a very, very interesting juncture when you think about the opportunistic credit investments.Gross domestic product in India rose 7.1% in the second quarter from a year earlier, the fastest among Asias major economies. The improving outlook for the worlds second most populous nation and progress in overhauling the nations bankruptcy procedures is also reviving investor confidence.India constrainedBlackRock sees significant opportunities across the spectrum, ranging from growth capital to stressed refinancing and distressed opportunities. Indias banking system is the most constrained in Asia due to bad loans, according to Seth.While the asset manager sees scope for lending in China, the east Asian nation is a little lower on the list due to ample onshore liquidity, according to Seth. When onshore liquidity is high, the premium shrinks, he said.BlackRock has expanded its private credit team for Asia, having hired former hedge fund manager Justin Ferrier as a managing director earlier this year. It expects the pullback among lenders to continue, creating gaps for alternative financiers. We are looking at the footsteps of banks and seeing what gaps they leave behind, said Seth.

279,0.2473,"New Delhi: In a setback to energy firms like ONGC and Cairn India, the government will from this fiscal levy service tax of about Rs730 crore on royalties they pay to the exchequer on oil and gas they produce.
				   
				Companies currently pay 9.09% of the price they realise on oil and gas produced from onland or onshore fields and 16.67% on the same from offshore areas. The Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC), in a recent clarification, has stated that the licence granted by the government to a company to exploit a natural resource is a taxable service and hence liable for service tax.As a rule, service tax is paid by the entity providing the service, but in certain cases it is the liability of the party that receives the service to remit the levy under a system called reverse charge. In the circular clarifying on service tax liability on use of wireless spectrum, CBEC stated that all periodic payments such as royalty on use of natural resources will attract 15% service tax.Following the clarification, the Service Tax department has sent letters to companies like Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), Cairn India Ltd and Reliance Industries seeking information on royalty payments, industry sources said.These companies had paid a total of Rs4,885 crore royalty on oil and gas produced in 2015-16. Considering change in prices and production profile, the service tax liability would come to over Rs730 crore this fiscal on top of the royalty payout. CBEC is using the logic that since service tax is leviable on wireless spectrum, which is a natural resources, the same should extend to oil and gas as well.Sources said energy explorers through their association have taken up the matte with the oil ministry saying their profitability has been severely impacted by slump in oil and gas prices to multi-year low and the additional levy would erode it further. CBEC in the circular stated that one-time payments for natural resources are exempt from service tax but not any periodic payments. Oil companies have to pay royalty on a monthly basis. Exemption from payment of service tax is applicable only to one time charge, payable in full upfront or in installments, for assignment of right to use any natural resource and not to any periodic payment required to be made such as Spectrum User Charges, license fee in respect of spectrum, or monthly payments with respect to the coal extracted from the coal mine or royalty payable on extracted coal and other natural resources, CBEC has said.

220,0.2487,"London: Some of the worlds biggest oil companies will invest $1 billion over the next 10 years to develop technologies to capture and store emissions of greenhouse gases and improve energy efficiency.
				   
				The investment, announced in a joint statement on Friday from companies including Saudi Arabian Oil Co., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA, BP Plc, Eni SpA, Statoil ASA and Repsol SA, aims to deploy low-carbon technologies on a large scale. Those energy producers, which together plan more than $90 billion of capital expenditure this year, are part of the oil and gas climate initiative, which is seeking ways the industry can support a global deal to tackle climate change while continuing to produce their hydrocarbon reserves.The creation of OGCI climate investments shows our collective determination to deliver technology on a large scale that will create a step change to help tackle the climate challenge, according to the statement. By working with others our companies play a key role in reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases.The investment comes as last years Paris climate accord enters into force, and three days before delegates from almost 200 countries gather in Marrakesh, Morocco for the latest round of talks to flesh out the deal. The companies, which together account for about a fifth of the worlds oil and gas output, last year backed policies consistent with limiting the increase in average global temperatures to within 2 degrees celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).Not enoughWe have got to welcome any positive move like this particularly, from the oil and gas industry, said Anthony Hobley, chief executive officer of the Carbon Tracker Initiative, a London-based group that studies the effects of climate change and policy on capital markets. $1 billion is not enough and it should be spent on clean energy and not squandered on carbon capture, he said.To give the world a 50% chance of limiting the temperature increase to below 2 degrees Celsius, about one third of oil reserves, half of natural gas and 80 of coal must remain unburnt, according to the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, a London-based researcher.The world needs to focus on ways to capture greenhouse gas emissions, not think about keeping oil in the ground, former Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali Al-Naimi said at an event in London Friday. Theres absolutely nothing wrong with fossil fuels and since the Paris climate agreement the kingdom, which has about 260 billion barrels of oil reserves, is focusing on ways to capture emissions, he said.Carbon captureThe OGCI said it has identified two initial focus areas: accelerating the deployment of carbon capture and storage and reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, which also warm the planet.The group, which was formed in 2014, also includes China National Petroleum Corp., Petroleos Mexicanos and Indias Reliance Industries Ltd. They have reduced greenhouse gas emissions from their own operations by 20% since 2005, according to the initiatives website. No US-based companies are part of the group.Even after the Paris climate deal agreed last year, the world still remains on track for as much as 3.4 degrees of warming by the end of the decade, according to the United Nations. Countries must make further pledges to cut at least 12 gigatons of carbon dioxide in order to meet the Paris goals, it said in a report on Thursday.

				Titans revenue fell marginally by 0.1% to Rs2,659.83 crore during the period.In April, Titan announced a voluntary retirement scheme for employees who had either finished 10 years of service or were above 40 years of age in a bid to improve productivity and cut costs. The move appears to have paid off in terms of profit growth.Gross margins were very good during the quarter. We are at 42% studded ratio and that added to the margin substantially. Another fact is also that in plain gold jewellery our margins were significantly higher thanks to the higher gold prices, senior executives at Titan including CEO (jewellery) C.K. Venkataraman, told analysts in a conference call on Friday.Still, both net profit and sales missed Street expectations of Rs192.20 crore and Rs 3,040.20 crore, respectively, based on a survey of analysts by Bloomberg.Net sales at its jewellery and eye-wear segments, and other businesses, including precision engineering and accessories, grew while revenue from watches declined from year-ago period.This was an extremely good quarter for the company,  with respect to profit.

				The bank cut the interest rate on home loans up to Rs 75 lakh to 9.20% from 9.35% for male customers. The interest rate for women has been lowered to 9.15% from 9.30%. For underprivileged customers, loans up to Rs25 lakh have been repriced to 9.15% from 9.30% earlier. The new rates became applicable starting 1 November, the bank said in a notification on its website.One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. The reduction in home loan rates follows ICICI Banks 10 bps rate cut in the one-year marginal cost based lending rate (MCLR), reduced to 8.95% on 28 October.ALSO READ | This or that: floating rate or fixed rate for a home loan?The private sector lenders move is in response to the new home loan rates announced by State Bank of India (SBI).Indias largest lender has cut its home loan rate to 9.15%, a cut of about 15 bps. Home loan rates for SBIs women customers has been dropped to 9.1%.The new rates are being offered under SBIs festive season offer. The state-owned bank is also offering a waiver on processing fees on home loans for customers who want to buy SBI approved projects and are applying online, those who want to transfer their home loans to the bank, and certain government employees.The housing finance market is currently dominated by SBI, which had a home loan portfolio worth Rs1.97 trillion, as on 30 June. In comparison, ICICI Bank had a home loan portfolio worth Rs1.13 trillion at the end of the first quarter.ALSO READ | Banks cut lending and deposit ratesAccording to Sumit Bali, senior executive vice-president and head-personal assets at Kotak Mahindra Bank, lenders have been passing on the benefit of falling interest rates in the system to their retail and small and medium enterprises (SME) customers over the last few months and the festive season should see more such offers coming up.Between August and September, Kotak Mahindra Bank ran a special monsoon offer where it waived processing fees for home loan customers who were also given an interest rate of 9.35% on their new loans. According to Bali, the bank may look at reintroducing these offers, depending on market conditions. Our six-month MCLR, which is the basic rate on which we price our home loans, is at about 9.2%. Presently, we are charging a premium of about 5 bps and we can reduce it to nil, depending on the customer profile. We wouldnt want to lose our customers over a 5-10 bps difference, he added.As experts see it, lenders will be using festive season demand as a means to prop up their lending portfolios which have been growing slowly over the most of this financial year. As of now, lenders are being quite selective in announcing festive offers. As corporate loan growth has been lagging for many quarters now, home finance seems to be the safest growth option for banks. Whether these rate reductions would go beyond the festive season, will determine if we are in a rate war- type situation, said Karthik Srinivasan, senior vice-president and co-head of financial sector ratings firm Icra Ltd.According to fortnightly data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), as on 14 October, the outstanding non-food credit for the banking system was reported at Rs72.7 trillion, showing only a 9% year-on-year growth.In comparison, home loans have been showing a growth of at least 18-20% year-on-year for the past many months and stood at over Rs8 trillion at the end of September, RBI data shows.

				Production by the worlds biggest miner in October fell 2% from the same month last year, while shipments dropped 3%, the company said on Tuesday. Both missed targets. Meanwhile, national inventories at power plants have fallen by almost half since hitting a record in April. Stockpiles were enough for 14 days of demand on average, though several plants were running with less than a weeks stockpiles, a level considered critical by Indian regulators, according to data from the Central Electricity Authority.The demand from the power sector continues to remain subdued, but it should start looking up now, said Abhisar Jain, an analyst at Mumbai-based Centrum Broking Ltd. Power plant coal stocks have been falling and good monsoons this season should boost industrial activity. We expect these to have a positive impact on coal demand in the coming months.The surge in international coal prices will also support Coal Indias efforts to displace imports of the fuel with domestic supplies, Jain said. Coal India reduced prices of higher grades of coal in May to compete with imports. Australias Newcastle coal, a seaborne benchmark in Asia, has more than doubled this year, ending last week at near $106 a metric ton, according to data from Globalcoal.Indias power generators had stocks for 18 days of demand on average a year ago, and 26 days as of 4 April, when inventories peaked, according to CEA data that tracks 102 facilities.

109,-0.247525,"Mumbai: As the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) delays releasing guidelines for the so-called S4A (sustainable structuring of stressed assets) scheme, lenders to some of Indias most debt-ridden companies are keeping those accounts on standby.  
				   
				According to three bankers with knowledge of the matter, creditors of textile maker Alok Industries Ltd and Bhushan Steel Ltd have evaluated the books of these companies and are waiting for RBI to clear the path ahead for them to implement S4A.  As of March 2016, Bhushan Steel had consolidated debt of Rs44,477.93 crore and Alok Industries Rs22,075.15 crore.RBI introduced the S4A scheme in June, allowing banks to convert as much as half the loans held by corporate borrowers into equity or equity-like securities. The move was intended to help restore the flow of credit to crucial sectors such as infrastructure and iron and steel, among others, reduce the stress on corporate borrowers and stanch bad loans across banks.In case of Alok Industries, the evaluation study has established that less than half of the companys debt is actually sustainable. We are expecting RBI to give some leeway in the structuring of the guidelines, so this case might benefit from the restructuring, said a senior official at a state-run bank, with direct knowledge of the case. The banker spoke on condition of anonymity as the discussions are confidential.  Lenders to Alok Industries decided on a strategic debt restructuring (SDR) of the company in November 2015, the company had said in a stock exchange notification. Under this scheme, lenders would be allowed to convert part of the debt in a company to majority equity, thereby taking over operational control. In January, it said lenders planned to acquire 65% of the company by converting debt to equity under SDR.  The S4A option was considered after lenders failed to find a suitable buyer for the company.In the case of Bhushan Steel, the lending consortium led by State Bank of India (SBI) and Punjab National Bank (PNB) has conducted a forensic audit, but hasnt moved ahead on the case since it is waiting for the final S4A guidelines, said the deputy managing director of a large state-owned bank, also on conditions of anonymity.  In January-March, lenders to Bhushan Steel started classifying the account as a non-performing asset under RBIs asset quality review. This was done after efforts for debt resolution such as joint lender forum (JLF) discussions and the 5/25 refinancing plan, which allows banks to extend the tenure of infrastructure loans, failed. The JLF was set up after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested Neeraj Singhal, vice-chairman at Bhushan Steel, in the cash-for-loans case in 2014. At the monetary policy announcement on 4 October, RBI governor Urjit Patel said the regulator would announce reworked guidelines around the S4A restructuring scheme by the end of that month. The regulator had said that it was looking at changing certain aspects of the guidelines which might come in the way of practical application, such as allowing banks to classify so-called sustainable debt as a standard account. The final guidelines are yet to emerge.  There is a time component to turning around stressed assets. These cases have already seen a lot of delay in the reworking of their debt, things need to move fast now, said the second banker cited above. Alok Industries and RBI did not respond to queries mailed to them. A spokesperson for Bhushan Steel did not respond to messages sent to his cell phone.The regulator's delay in issuing revised guidelines points at RBIs need for making S4A a more inclusive restructuring mechanism. While the banking regulator does not want to seem like it is being too easy on restructuring cases, it does want to bring in more cases under S4A, the managing partner of a stressed asset consulting firm said on conditions of anonymity.Others say delays in restructuring are also a function of banks inertia.""Regulatory delays are one thing, but lenders are also not really willing to take tough calls in difficult situations. Most public sector banks seem to be too scared of vigilance-related investigations, which acts as a deterrent when they have to decide on taking big haircuts during such turnaround cases, the head of the restructuring practice at a global consulting firm said, also seeking anonymity.According to the S4A norms issued by the central bank in June, banks are allowed to split the debt of a stressed company into sustainable and unsustainable parts.  According to RBI norms, the unsustainable debt can be converted into long-term, equity-like instruments that will be on a banks investment books while the rest of the debt can be restructured.Under S4A norms, promoters will be required to dilute their shareholding in exchange for converting a part of the unsustainable debt into equity. These promoters shares would be given to banks, which will continue to hold them till a company turns around, after which lenders can sell the equity.  Promoters will continue to have the first right of refusal to these shares.  Most other restructuring options on offer have not delivered satisfactory results, resulting in higher accumulation of bad loans on the books of banks, which collectively hold Rs6.3 trillion of non-performing assets.",2016-11-07,EJzIYX2yzAzPfPgv2Dg8DJ,The creditors of Alok Industries and Bhushan Steel are waiting for RBI to issue fresh guidelines,00:49,Lenders put top NPA cases on standby over S4A norms delay
141,0.248775,"London/ Hong Kong: HSBC Holdings Plc reported third-quarter profit that beat analysts estimates as chief executive officer Stuart Gulliver pared costs and bolstered the lenders capital cushion. The shares jumped by the most in two months in Hong Kong.
				   
				Adjusted pretax profit, which excludes one-time items, rose 7% from a year earlier to $5.59 billion, Europes largest bank said in a statement on Monday. That compared with the $5.29 billion average estimate of five analysts compiled by Bloomberg News.A UK regulators altered treatment of HSBCs stake in Chinas Bank of Communications Co. cut the British banks risk-weighted assets by $120.9 billion. That freed up $5.6 billion, which increased the lenders capital ratio and will help to support its dividend and any future share buybacks, as well as providing a buffer for the continuing uncertain regulatory environment, Gulliver said.This should be enough to allow the bank to maintain the dividend next year, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analysts led by Chirantan Barua said in a note. For yield investors who have been the source of support for valuation of this stock, this keeps the stock in the safety zone into the next six to nine months.The companys shares rose 2.3% in Hong Kong as of 1.28pm after earlier gaining as much as 3%.The banks common equity Tier 1 ratio rose to 13.9% from 12.1% three months earlier. That beat estimates of Morgan Stanley analysts, who expected an improvement to 12.9%.Almost six years into his tenure, Gulliver is striving to maintain revenue while paring global operations to trim $5 billion of annual expenses. His efforts to redeploy more assets into Asia have been complicated by Chinas slowing economy, while the bank is also navigating tougher capital rules, low interest rates and misconduct scandals.The stock had climbed 11% in London this year, the second-most among major European lenders behind Standard Chartered Plc at Fridays close. Both get the vast majority of their profit in Asia and report in dollars, limiting the impact of Britains vote to leave the European Union. Even so, HSBC still trades below its book value.Adjusted revenue gained 2.4% to $12.8 billion. Adjusted operating costs fell 3.5% to $7.25 billion, compared with the $7.33 billion average estimate of the five analysts surveyed.Since Gulliver started restructuring the bank in 2011, hes slashed headcount by about 44,000 and pledged 25,000 cuts last year, exiting at least 80 businesses. Globally, its retreated to 71 countries and territories from 88. Nevertheless, as with most European lenders, HSBC has been struggling to boost profitability. In August, management removed a target to surpass a 10% return on equity by the end of 2017, citing economic and political uncertainties, and stepped back from its progressive dividend policy.Adjusted pretax profit in Asia climbed 10% to $3.8 billion in the quarter from a year earlier, while Europe reported a 5.4% gain to $863 million.At the retail banking and wealth management division, adjusted profit rose to $1.8 billion from $1.5 billion a year earlier. In global banking and markets, which houses the investment bank, adjusted profit jumped to $2.5 billion from $1.93 billion in the period. The gain was primarily driven by the banks fixed-income businesses, which gained market share in Europe, HSBC said.Finance director Iain Mackay has said revenue is suffering because of record-low interest rates around the world, a particular problem for HSBC because it houses more than $400 billion of surplus deposits. Mackay said in August the lender would lose about $100 million of net interest income a year as a result of the Bank of England cutting its main interest rate by 25 basis points after Brexit.Adjusted loan impairment charges increased to $566 million in the third quarter from $434 million a year earlier.

96,0.24945,"When was the last time you listened to music on an actual CD? Or read the days headlines in a physical newspaper? Chances are it has been years. Digital technology and software has replaced a lot of things in our lives.
				   
				According to media futurist Robert Tercek, going forward, we will see more of vaporization, a term he has coined to refer to the process of replacing physical things with software that can be downloaded to any device. The apps on your phone have quietly replaced newspapers, books, music players, diaries and countless other things.We are moving from millions to billions, to trillions of connected devices, and the invisible world of software is growing at twice the rate of the normal economy, says Tercek.As more people connect to the network, the software of the network becomes more valuable and that drives even more people to connect, increasing the value of the network. In an interview, Tercek, the former president of digital media at The Oprah Winfrey Network and author of the book Vaporized, talks about how software is disrupting society. Edited excerpts:You say we are moving to a software-defined society. How is that changing the way the economy functions?The first rule thats important for the software world is this idea that the network is more valuable and the devices get cheaperthat changes the economics. Its very difficult for manufacturing companies to understand that in the future products will be cheaper, but also more valuable. Devices will get cheaper and smarter. Metcalfes Law says the network will get more valuable over time. For the end-users, things cost less, so they expect devices to be cheaper and smarter and they expect to get more value out of them. For companies that manufacture products, this is very difficult. Those companies are vulnerable to Internet economics, the economics of Facebook or Google. Thats a challenge that most havent realized.All companies will become software companies. The implication of that has not yet sunk in and many companies are still operating in old industrial styles. They seldom realize that software is far more important than the physical product. Auto manufacturers, for instance, dont see themselves as software companies; they see themselves as car makers. They think the value is in the metal, rubber and plastic. The value is very quickly moving to software. The companies that focus on software for auto are going to be most successful. We saw the same thing in personal computers, mobile phones and consumer electronics: software eventually became more important than the physical device.Which industries are most prone to vaporization? Are any immune?No industry is immune. I also think that governments, education and healthcare will soon be affected, so this is a mega trend that will reshape the whole society. The industries that have been most affected so far are finance, media, consumer electronics and advertising. The next that will be transformed are healthcare, transportation, education and insurance. Everything that happened in infotech during the past 40 years will soon happen to every other industry in the world. So, in a way, you can see that any business that involves geographytransportation, logistics or shoppingwill be transformed into information businesses. Biology is becoming an information science as well, so agriculture, pharmaceuticals, healthcare and the food industry are going to change. We are now able to program biology in the same way we program a computer.Manufacturing is going to be transformed in a couple of ways. The first one is, of course, robotics. Robotics is the replacement of human labour with software, thats what software automation is. The other trends that are important as well are 3D printing and nanotechnology. Theres already now a 3D printer from Revolution Medicine that will take any substance and break it down to its molecular parts, sort them out and then using software, recompose those molecules into new forms, including combinations that dont exist in nature When things are replaced by software, it means that the barriers that constraintime and spaceare eliminated, because software can deliver instantly. China and Asia, the places that we have been outsourcing manufacturing for the US and Europe, (will) no longer have their big advantage. It will erode because now you will be able to manufacture in any place using software.How are governments changing the way they function?In the past, most governments used human labour to enforce regulation and process paper and handle information. In both cases, software can do a better job. When you have sensors measuring everything, you dont need human regulators checking everything. You can simply do that with software and have better data than we get from human inspectors, so enforcement regulation will change tremendously. In future, we will be able to write the rule in software and encode in a bitcoin(-style) blockchain. All the sensors that are connected to the system will simply report the data and we will have software-defined regulation.In a representative democracy, voting is also [going to be] encoded in the blockchain very soon. We have already seen some parties in Scandinavia use the blockchain for their own internal voting.Whats the future of big corporations like the GEs of the world?The reason we have big corporations is because its more efficient for a company to avoid transaction costs for managing a group of freelance suppliers. As long as its cheaper to do a job internally within a corporation, the job will be done internally. But now the Internet makes it very easy for companies to hire workers who arent on the payroll, workers who are outside the corporation. You can use software to manage them. One way to look at Uber is that it has vaporized managementthe management of the dispatcher is a software program, so job functions have been turned into software. It suggests that we may not need corporations in the future. A company called Ethereum in Canada is trying to replace the entire corporation with software. They are trying to write a software robot program that has all the job functions in the corporation which is kind of a crazy idea, (but it is) actually quite possible.Do big corporations need to drastically change their business models?In industry after industry, corporations move too slowly. They dont go out of business, they just become less relevant because they are not where the growth is. So, if you choose not to participate, you choose not to turn your company into software or replace jobs with software, you wont disappear overnight. A future growth (driver) will emerge and your company will not be part of it. Auto makers and watch makers have a difficult choice to make: they cant stop making cars or watches, thats their business today. At the same time, they see that the future is going to be all about software, and cars or watches will be less important, but they are not good at making software. They certainly arent good enough to compete with Google or other software giants. Should that company embark on a rapid course of action and try to become a software developer or should they partner with Google? If you partner with Google, thats not a great strategy because look at what happened to the smartphone companies. All the companies that manufacture smartphones dont make much money on smartphones: Google literally commoditizes these companies because it sucks the value out of the device and into the network.This is a very difficult challenge for every company that manufactures products: they must become a software company. The question is do they build it themselves, do they buy a company or do they partner with a giant company like Google and become part of their ecosystem? All difficult choices.What do you see emerging as the new sources of competitive advantage in this new world?The companies that understand they have a proprietary data asset will (succeed). What I mean by proprietary data asset is any information asset that grows. In the case of Facebook, thats the social graph. There are many other companies that are mapping the world right now, they are building a location graph. Google has tremendous knowledge about where people are surfing and where they are going, so they have the interest graph. Each company can thereby define a graph.The idea is that each business has at its core, a unit of information, a body of information. When we move business to the network, that information asset should grow if you design your business in the right way. That will emerge as the most important thing for that company over time: an information asset that continues to grow as more people and more devices are connected.Companies that dont rush to embrace often lose their information advantage and someone else comes and steals that from them. So, one way to look at all the struggles that are happening around the world right now, is theres a battle happening for control of data assets. You see this when Google is confronted by the European government about privacy, or when Apple is confronted by the FBI about secrecy and security. Most companies do not understand how to manage or protect their data assets. The successful companies make (data protection) a priority.So, what do you think the Fortune 500 list will look like 20 years from now? What kind of companies will you see there and which ones would be gone?Big automotive makers will be replaced by big companies that provide transportation as a service. Banks will be replaced by companies that provide automatic, secure transactions using the blockchain or something similar Today, the businesses of pharmaceutical companies is a bit like Hollywood: they spend lots of money making drugs and they hope that one becomes a big hit and they make billions of dollars. In the future, you will have customized medical treatment designed for your genome. It will be individualized healthcare. So, pharmaceutical (companies will) shift from mass manufacturing drugs to more of a service delivery model that will be customized to individuals. The companies themselves may stay and remain successful, but they will change into software companies that provide digital services.What other areas will feel the impact?Education will be delivered in software in the future and this bothers a lot of people who feel very sentimental about college education. Its obvious that most people in the world cant afford to go to a private college, most university systems [cannot] take in millions of new students. There has to be an alternative. Software delivery education is the reality today. Its not as good as college education, but remember, these are early days. We have to educate a billion people a year, theres no way we can do that within campus. Robotics will shift so many people out of jobs, everyone will have to retrained. Every worker will have to reskill and retrain consistently. One of the things we will have to do is learn how to work with machines, robots and software automation.If you think about all the really big industries in the worldhealthcare, food supply, transportation, energyall these enormous systems have been designed to serve human beings. That worked well for the last 200 years, but heres the question: if you can vaporize everything, the ultimate expression is to replace the human body by software. Can we replace the human body with software? It seems preposterous, yet there are scientists working right now to model the human brain and replicate the human being in software. Some scientists are working on whole brain emulation. Why? One, there are a lot of places we cant explore: in the depths of the ocean, inside volcanoes, deep inside the earth and also in space. Human beings cant survive in those environments, machines can. If we travel to other stars or planets, the only way thats going to happen is if we can replace the human body, because too much of the weight of spacecraft cargo is life support for human bodies.Is everything about this good?Theres always danger with technology. Technology always makes something that we are familiar with obsolete. You can think of it as super power: it introduces new powers that can be used for good or bad. We shouldnt judge the technology, its really how it is used we should judge, that is a human decision. People are worried about artificial intelligence. This is silly. Its artificial intelligence thats poorly written, (that is used in) the wrong way by human beings, those are things we should be concerned with.Read an unabridged version of the interview on www.foundingfuel.com, published in an exclusive partnership with knowledge.ckgsb.edu.cn/",2016-11-07,CkPEF5bEOBXf98u5jbt98L,"Robert Tercek, futurist and author of the book Vaporized, talks about how digital technology pushes us towards a software-defined society",02:41,No industry is immune from vaporization: Robert Tercek

Shree Cement said it will set up a grinding unit in Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan with a capacity of 3.6 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) with an initial plan to set up a blending unit. The expansion will cost about Rs300 crore, which will come from internal accruals. The project is expected to be completed by April-June 2017-18, it added. The firm also revised its earlier expansion plan for the Bihar unit. Now, it will expand the existing capacity from 3.6 MTPA to 4.5 MTPA through installing blending equipment and de-bottlenecking with a cost of about Rs17 crore, which will be met through internal accruals. In August, Shree Cement had said it will expand capacity of its cement grinding unit at Aurangabad (Bihar) to 5.60 MTPA at a cost of around Rs285 crore.

134,0.246775,"The US election is upon us. We watch the see-sawing in the polls with bated breathlast Wednesdays Mint carried a blurb that Donald Trump now has a slender lead over Hillary Clinton. The truth is we will not know the result until all is said and done on 8 November.
				   
				While I am apolitical, at least in public, I cant help but observe with interest the political process itself, and to note how this process has been affected in so many ways by the use, misuse and timing of data. Never has a US election campaign been smudged with as much invective as the current one. Mutual hatred seems to be the one constant theme, and constructive debate on the issues, both inside America and within its large sphere of global influence, has been pushed to the fringes. And much of what lies at the core of this shift to hatred is the use and misuse of data in ways that one simply couldnt imagine a few years ago.Data never dies in the Internet age. Everything one has ever written or has been recorded saying is saved forever, in some obscure server somewhere on the planet. Going in and deleting data doesnt work either. It can simply be recovered, even by a hacker with limited skills. Try pulling out of Facebook, for example. While your account will be shut down, Facebook will tell you that you are better off deactivating it so you can come back to it at some future time. It brings to mind Don Henley and Glenn Freys immortal line from the song Hotel California, the Eagles greatest hit, which says you can check out, but you can never leave.Data is now referred to in zetabytes (where one zetabyte is equivalent to one trillion gigabytes). Studies show that in 2006, the Internet produced about 0.16 zetabytes of data, which then grew at a compound annual rate of 25% for the next decade, going to 8.5 zetabytes at the end of last year. Someone trawling the Internet is bound to stumble upon something of shock value, which can be used at the appropriate time to completely take the wind out of a candidates sails.The media has had a field day discussing the various October surprises that came out last monthFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director James Comeys decision to reopen the email case against Clinton (yes, those are still live on a server somewhere)and Trumps foul language against women, which was taped and digitized a decade ago. And so they shouldthe voting public has a right to know about these things, and the media, however biased it may or may not be, still has a duty to bring these sorts of issues out into the open when people are trying to decide on who their next leader is.And then there are the ubiquitous polls. For a confidence level of 95% with a margin of error of 5%, all you need as a sample size to reflect the mood of the 300 plus million US population is a sample of about 380. However, poll organizations like Gallup use a sample size of around 1,000 for most of their polls, in an attempt to ensure a lower margin of error, and conduct these polls on a regular basis during the election season. These polls are then made public in the media, and take on more significance each time an Octoberor earlier surprisesurfaces. The New York Times, in an article on 31 October, pointed out that some of these surprises were held out as events that were true turning points that permanently shifted the race, but in truth, while many of the polls have shifted back and forth, and despite state maps, FBI flip-flops and Bayesian flips which involve sophisticated statistical reasoning, we are no closer to knowing who will win the race.What say you, fans of analytics and big data? If we have truly crossed the chasm of being able to understand how data functions and how it can lead businessesand by extension, election campaignsinto making the right decisions, we should not be where we are. Given all the so-called intelligent data algorithms that have been written over the past few years, a clear winner should have emerged some time ago. These same algorithms have been guiding the decisions made by businesses for a while nowespecially with respect to strategic decisions and shifts in company direction based on consumer behaviour. In a world where corporations have had to make binary choices (either path X or path Y, but not both), these algorithms fall short.The New York Times piece goes on to say that this may well be because many voters are still undecided, or like me, will refuse to divulge their choice to a pollster. These voters sit on the margin, which is where the final result always lies in a binary choice; they will be the ones who finally decide who wins on Tuesday. It also points out that a majority of voters dislike both candidates and would prefer not to vote for either of them. This is a sad state of affairs for American polity. That said, in a quote variously attributed to Alexis de Tocqueville and to Joseph de Maistrethe people get the government they deserve.And the big data experts get back to the drawing board to continue to create fear, uncertainty and doubtall of which can only result in more business for them and their ilk.Siddharth Pai is a world-renowned technology consultant who has personally led over $20 billion in complex, first-of-a-kind outsourcing transactions.",2016-11-08,IPLgVL2bWf1JSABCgqclHI,"Big Data experts get back to the drawing board to continue to create fear, uncertainty and doubtall of which can only result in more business for them and their ilk",00:39,Big Data and the US election

This is likely to make lenders nervous, and they may show restraint in extending any further credit, until there is clarity regarding the evolving relationship between Tata Sons and the operating businesses.

95,0.24525,"Private equity (PE) firm Kedaara Capital Advisors Ltd, co-founded by PE veteran Manish Kejriwal, is gearing up to float its second fund to raise around $600-650 million, two people familiar with the matter said. The formal process is expected to begin by mid-2017, one of the persons said on condition of anonymity.
				   
				Kedaara was founded in 2011 by Kejriwal, former India head of Singapore sovereign wealth management fund Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd, Sunish Sharma and Nishant Sharma, who were managing director and principal, respectively, of global PE firm General Atlantic in India.The PE firm raised its debut fund with a corpus of $540 million in 2013, in one of the largest fund-raisings by an independent, home-grown PE platforms until then.Originally targeting $500 million, the fund was oversubscribed, attracting investors from all over. Canadian pension fund Ontario Teachers Pension Plan anchored the vehicle and was joined by other sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, family offices, fund of funds and endowments.On its second outing, the PE firm is currently sending feelers to prospective limited partners (LPs), or investors in investment funds.They are initiating soft conversations with prospective LPs now and will embark on a formal fund-raising process only by mid-next year, said the first person cited above on condition on anonymity.The move to launch a second fund comes on the heels of two stellar exits recorded by the firm.They have registered stellar exits in a short frame of time. They have made about 75% IRR (internal rate of return) in Au Financiers and about 55% IRR in Bill Forge, added the second person.In September, automotive components supplier Mahindra CIE Automotive, a joint venture between Mahindra Group and CIE of Spain, agreed to acquire a 100% stake in Bengaluru-based machine components manufacturer Bill Forge, for about $200 million.Kedaara, which acquired 50% stake in Bill Forge last year for around $48 million, exited completely. In June, it exited Au Financiers Ltd, a retail non-banking financial services company and one of the 10 firms to receive in-principle approval to start a small finance bank.A report in VCCircle said that foreign investors sold their holdings in Au Financiers in part or full in a deal worth $110 million to help the latter bring down the foreign holding to 49% from 64% to comply with one of the prerequisites for a small bank licence.When contacted, Kedaaras co-founder and managing director Kejriwal said, We do not comment on market rumours.Both Kedaaras recent exits have been quick compared to the usual PE  investment horizon of three to five years.The speedy exits by Kedaara could well be a good thing for the PE firm. A recent study by McKinsey & Co.s Private Equity and Principal Investment Group showed that PE returns drop as holding periods increase. According to the study, PE investments with holding periods of between one and three years delivered above 40% return, higher than any other holding period.The performance on exits shown by Kedaara also comes at a time when the Indian PE industry, notorious for its poor exit performance, has witnessed over $16 billion worth of exits in the past two years.According to data from Venture Intelligence, so far in 2016, PE funds have registered exits worth $6.7 billion, while in 2015, PE funds recorded exits worth $9.4 billion. The 2015 exit performance was the highest in the past five years.Kedaaras debut deal was an investment of Rs200 crore in Mahindra Logistics Ltd in April 2014. It has also invested in companies such as Parksons Packaging Ltd and Manjushree Technopack. Its latest investment was the buyout of Au Housing Finance, the mortgage arm of Au Financiers, along with Swiss PE firm Partners Group, for around $140 million.The private equity firm is about 55% committed across six investments which is about $300 million and has invested across sectors, said the second person cited above.Kedaara positions itself as an operationally oriented PE firm pursuing control and minority investment opportunities in India.

60,0.24815,"Ousted Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry was pushing C. Sivasankaran, who had played dealmaker in several Tata group transactions in the past, to pay up the Siva groups share of the DoCoMo award, and also discussed with the board of the holding company possible legal action against the sometimes controversial, Seychelles-based entrepreneur, documents seen by Mint show.
				   
				On 15 September, at his penultimate Tata Sons board meeting as chairman, Mistry raised this issue, the documents show. He was removed as chairman when the board next met on 24 October.Interestingly, on 19 September, Tata Sons (Tata Teleservices Ltd and NTT DoCoMo Inc. are named as co-respondents) received a legal notice from a firm retained by Sivasankarans Sterling Info-tech Ltd, alleging mismanagement of Tata Teleservices and reserving the right to seek damages to recover its (Sterlings) losses.Mint learns that a decision on how to respond to this email had not been taken till Mistrys exit.Tata group spokesperson Debasis Ray said in an email response to Mints queries that in 2008, when Docomo agreed to acquire shares of Tata Teleservices, Tata Sons voluntarily offered other shareholders of TTSL an opportunity for a pro-rata sale of their holdings. This was subject to the shareholders agreeing to bear a pro-rata portion of any claims or amounts payable to Docomo should such an event arise.... Thereafter in 2014, Docomo exercised the put option. In terms of the agreement with the selling shareholders, Tata Sons demanded from Mr Sivasankaran his pro-rata share of the amount payable to Docomo.Ray added that Tata Sons is pursuing all legal options for recovery of this amount.Mint couldnt ascertain whether the company had responded to Sivasankarans notice. Sivasankaran could not be reached for comment immediately.The notice from Sivasankarans law firm mentions his long-standing association with the Tata Group of Companies on account of his close association with Mr Ratan Tata.Sivasankaran has had several dealings with the group, taking Barista, Indias first coffee chain that the Tata group had acquired, off its hands, selling Dishnet DSL to the Tata-owned VSNL, which subsequently became Tata Communications, and facilitating the sale of the Tata stake in the Birla-Tata-AT&T telecom venture to the Aditya Birla Group, resulting in the formation of Idea Cellular Ltd.In early 2006, the Siva group acquired 520 million shares in Tata Teleservices at Rs 17 per share or Rs884 crore. It paid Rs102 crore towards this, the documents show. It paid the balance in February 2006. Of the Rs782 crore, the documents show that Rs650 crore was funded by a loan from Standard Chartered Bank effectively guaranteed by Tata Sons. The balance Rs132 crore came from Kalimati Investments, a subsidiary of Tata Steel.Ray confirmed both and said that to ensure that in the event of a default on the repayment of the loan, the shares of Tata Teleservices were not sold to a third party, Tata Sons agreed to an arrangement whereby the bank would sell the shares to Tata Sons.He added that a part of the consideration was funded by another Tata company for a few days on market-linked terms.In 2006, when the loan was refunded, the Tata group withdrew this guarantee, and the Siva group had to provided other collateral to the bank, the documents show.Then came the 2008 deal with DoCoMo under which the latter bought shares amounting to 26% of Tata Teleservices equity. Of the 26%, 20% was to be fresh equity and 6%, a sale by existing shareholders. Under this, the documents with Mint show, Sivasankaran sold 20.74 million shares at Rs117.81 apiece, turning a tidy profit.The DoCoMo investment eventually turned sour, and with no initial public offering in sight, the Japanese company exercised a put option. The resulting litigation led to an award of Rs8,450 crore to DoCoMo. Of this, the Siva groups share was Rs694 crore.The September legal notice from the Siva group and a letter to Mistry in October 2013 from Sivasankaran refer to Tata Teleservicess dire need for equity, and present the Siva groups investment in the company as a sort of lifeline.This representation was disputed by Mistry in his response to the letter. I have been advised by Mr (Ratan) Tata that the investment made by the Siva Group was made principally on the consideration that the telecom sector was fast-growing and represented a good investment opportunity. In his letter, Sivasankaran referred to an earlier letter to Ratan Tata in 2011 seeking assistance in finding a buyer for the Siva groups holding in Tata Teleservices.He further asks Mistry for a fair resolution (presumably a buyback of his holdings) in line with the mutually benevolent relation between the Tata group and Siva group which made the Siva group walk the extra miles to support the Tata group by undertaking risks which no financial investor acting in self-interest would.From Rays comments, it looks like that resolution is headed for the courts.",2016-11-09,8UuRA0q7zaqX07hXw3QxPL,"At his penultimate Tata Sons board meeting as chairman, Cyrus Mistry raised the issue, the documents show",01:31,Cyrus Mistry was trying to get Siva group to pay share of DoCoMo award
153,0.22275,"Shares of Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) jumped nearly 3% on Tuesday after the firm beat analysts estimates on all operating parameters for the September quarter. But order inflows were poor and they paint a gloomy picture of the economy.
				   
				First, a look at the positives that drove the stock price up. Dogged execution and the 12% year-on-year (y-o-y) increase in net revenue were many notches higher that what the Street expected. Along with this, the firms tight control on expenses, be it raw material costs, employee costs or other expenses helped BHEL post a Rs155 crore operating profit from a loss in the year-ago period. This compares with Bloombergs consensus estimate of a profit of Rs68 crore. BHELs net profit of Rs109 crore was a huge 82% above consensus estimates.But one cannot overlook the negatives. In sharp contrast to the profit outperformance was the paltry Rs1,800 crore order inflow during the quarter, down 30% from a year ago. The first six months tally of Rs4,800 crore is barely one-fifth of what the firm secured in the previous comparable period. The order backlog fell to Rs1.03 trillion as opposed to Rs1.12 trillion a year ago. This is of concern as it points to a paucity of capital investment both in the power sector and industry.To add to this, the management, in its analysts concall, has stated that some existing orders may be cancelled. Investors are also aware that a large part of the order book is in slow-moving projects, which may lead to slower revenue growth in the future.If that happens, there is a lurking danger of the firm slipping again on the profitability front. After all, its operating margin was a wafer-thin 2.3% during the September quarter.Lack of orders is a grave concern in light of the firms massive capacity. BHELs capacity for boiler-turbine-generator is 20 gigawatts (GW) and the entire industry pipeline of estimated orders is much lower. According to a report by Jefferies Equity Research, BHELs return on equity (RoE) will peak at 7% over the next two-to-three years. At 100% capacity utilization, it would achieve an ROE of 13%, it says, adding that this is before the 7th Pay Commission changes come into consideration. Obviously, staff costs will inch up thereafter, dampening profitability.The quarters performance was stellar.

However, Tuesdays announcement is unlikely to help Fords India operations immediately and the focus will be more on feeding into the Detroit-based companys global operations.Ford in India continues to struggle even after being present in the country for more than 20 years, in which the Indian market has changed drastically.In the six years between 2010-11 and 2015-16, the American car makers annual sales in India have grown only twice.

An email sent to the Edelweiss spokesperson on Tuesday did not elicit any response.In one of the largest buyouts in the multiplex business, Carnival acquired Big Cinemas, a division of Anil Ambanis Reliance MediaWorks Ltd, for around Rs700 crore in December 2014.Carnival, which bought 252 screens of Big Cinemas, had added 30 screens with the acquisition of HDIL Broadway for Rs110 crore in January 2014. In 2015, Carnival made its third acquisition by buying out Stargaze Entertainment Pvt.

189,-0.2358,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday eased the rules for various stressed asset resolution schemes and expanded the scope of a loan recast plan previously limited to the infrastructure sector.
				   
				RBI also streamlined the process for change of ownership of stressed assets outside of the so-called strategic debt restructuring (SDR) process, which allowed creditors to convert debt into equity and take over the management of defaulting companies.Under its latest loan resolution plan, the scheme for sustainable structuring of stressed assets (S4A), RBI has allowed banks to classify at least half the debt involved as a standard assets.Under S4A guidelines, first announced in June, banks were allowed to split the funded liabilities of a stressed company into sustainable and unsustainable debt. The sustainable debt would be left alone to perform or be restructured if necessary, while the unsustainable debt would be converted into equity or equity-like, long-dated securities and redeemed at a later date.The revised norms say in case a non-performing asset (NPA) is restructured under S4A norms, the sustainable part of the debt can be classified as standard if banks set aside provisions equal to at least 50% of the debt classified as unsustainable or 20% of aggregate debt, whichever his higher.For this purpose, the provisions already held in the account can be reckoned, RBI guidelines said. When these norms were introduced in June,  if the account was an NPA on the reference date, banks were asked to classify both halves as an NPA even when S4A restructuring was under process. In case the account is standard when it goes into S4A, the entire outstanding debt will remain standard, subject to provisions made upfront by the lenders being at least 40% of the unsustainable amount or 20% of the aggregate outstanding, whichever is higher.Since standard assets require lower provisions, this would require banks to set a smaller amount aside.RBI also said the unsustainable part of debt in any S4Awhether the account was NPA or standard at the time of restructuringcould be upgraded to standard, if the sustainable half of the debt performed satisfactorily for one year. Banks would also be allowed to reverse all provisions made when the unsustainable half of the debt is upgraded. However, in all cases, the required mark-to-market provisions on instruments after conversion of unsustainable debt must be maintained at all times.In the so-called 5/25 scheme, which allowed loan payments to be stretched out, RBI has increased the coverage to all sectors. It has also allowed smaller projectswhere banks have at least Rs250 crore exposureto qualify for this scheme.Not all rules have been eased. In SDR, RBI said banks cannot book income after 90 days of invoking the scheme even though they continue to classify the asset as standard.In cases where banks have decided to change ownership in a firm outside SDR norms, deadlines were set for these changes. According to RBI, the conversion of debt into equity  should be completed in  90 days from date of approval by a lending consortium or the joint lender forum. In case  a pledge of equity shares is invoked, it has set a deadline of 180 days.

364,0.16899999999999998,"Tata Sons Ltd has removed Cyrus P. Mistry as chairman of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and sought to replace him as a director of the software services provider as the fight between the holding company and its former chairman (and significant shareholder) enters a new phase.
				   
				Tata Sons, which has a 73.26% stake in TCS, nominated Ishaat Hussain, a Tata group veteran, as the interim chairman of the company with immediate effect. Thus, Mistry ceases to be chairman of the TCS board, the company said in a stock exchange statement on Thursday.Separately, Tata Sons has requested a shareholder meeting of Indian Hotels Co. Ltd (IHCL) to pass a resolution for the removal of Mistry as director. On 4 November, IHCLs independent directors unanimously backed Mistrys board position as chairman.This could mark the beginning of a protracted battle,  analysts said.Also read: Did Tata Sons violate insider trading norms?According to the articles of association of TCS, as long as Tata Sons (and associates) holds at least 26% of the firm, the holding company has the right to nominate the chairman of the board of directors.People close to Mistry have questioned TCSs move, saying that Tata Sons has the right to only nominate a candidate.TCS had to then convene a board meeting and table the nomination at the board at a meeting or through a circular resolution. Nothing of this nature was done. In pre-meditated haste, by a letter of the same date, TCS has directly gone on to announce that Mistry stands replaced, one of the people said.A TCS spokesperson said the due process was followed. Under Article 90 of the articles of association of the company, the majority shareholders of Tata Sons are vested with the power to nominate the chairman. Accordingly, it informed all the board directors that Hussain is being nominated as the chairman, the spokesperson said. Sumit Agrawal, partner, Suvan Law Advisors, said that under the Companies Act, where articles of association specifically and categorically provide a right to a major shareholder or group of shareholder to nominate a chairman, exercising that right effectively removes the incumbent with immediate effect till a regular appointment of someone else through a shareholder resolution is made.The concept of shareholders right in the modern corporate world denotes the shareholders supremacy in the governance of the business and the affairs of the corporate sector either directly or through their elected representatives, said Agrawal.These shareholders, he pointed out, have certain statutory rights which nobody can take away, except in accordance with prescribed norms under articles and provisions of the Companies Act.That said, the process followed in TCS to nominate a new chairman neednt necessarily be followed in other group companies. Thats because the method of appointment or removal of chairman is incorporated in the articles of association of a company. In Tata Motors, for instance, the right to appoint the chairman lies with the board and not Tata Sons.Also read: Is trust deficit widening on Tatas narrative on Cyrus Mistry?For removing Mistry as a director, shareholder approval is needed and the request for an extraordinary general meeting in TCS by Tata Sons points to that.Under the provisions of the Companies Act, anyone holding at least 10% of a company can call for a shareholders meeting and propose a special resolution to remove directors before the end of their tenure.Amit Tandon, founder and managing director of Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS), a proxy advisory firm, said that the latest move marks the beginning of Tata Sons moving shareholder resolutions to remove Mistry from the board of operating companies.In the case of TCS, as they have more than 70% stake, they are quite confident of pulling it through, he said.In other Tata group operating companies where Mistry is chairman, Tata Sons (plus other group companies that have cross-holdings) owns a 30-35% stake.In Tata Chemicals, whose board met on Thursday, it has only a 29.98% ownership.To pass a resolution supporting the removal of Mistry as director, the Tatas will need a 51% majority. Thus, the role of institutional shareholders, particularly Life Insurance Corp. of India, becomes important.The state-owned insurer holds around 13% each in Tata Steel Ltd and Tata Power, and 10% in Tata Global Beverages Ltd.The vote of institutional investors will be decisive. Perhaps, this is a reason why Tata Sons has come out with a detailed statement today explaining its need to replace Mr. Mistry and also rejecting claims made by him in his letter to the Board of Tata Sons, said a statement by InGovern Research Services Pvt. Ltd.Hussains nomination comes on the heels of a snub the promoters faced on 4 November when independent directors unanimously backed Mistrys board position at Indian Hotels, which owns the Taj group. On Thursday, the independent directors of Tata Chemicals too backed Mistry.Interestingly, Hussain, who is also on the board of Tata Sons, abstained from voting to remove Mistry as chairman of the holding company in its 24 October board meeting.",2016-11-10,oQZzLk3MfdxNik2CRdYXGM,"Tata Sons, which has a 73.26% in TCS, has nominated Ishaat Hussain, a long-time Tata group veteran, as the interim chairman of TCS with immediate effect",08:42,"Tata Sons seeks Cyrus Mistrys removal from TCS, IHCL boards"

				Rising Straits has acquired an existing NBFC and is raising around $100 million from a financial investor to capitalize the NBFC, which has been named Rising Straits Finance Co. Pvt. Ltd. The NBFC will start lending operations from the beginning of 2017 with around $150 million, including capital infused internally.Apart from the regular residential and office projects, the new NBFC will also lend to projects in the logistics, hospitality and healthcare sectors. Traditional banking channels are unable to fill the funding gap in the sector today, which is why so many NBFCs are coming up. NBFCs are stepping in to address those gaps, said Bedi, chairman and managing director, Rising Straits Capital. Bedi, who also co-founded Red Fort Capital, said that the NBFC will take off with $100-150 million and then increase it to about $300 million of debt. Mint wrote in a 13 September article that Rising Straits Capital was in the process of acquiring an NBFC. Rising Straits is currently also raising capital from offshore investors, through the managed account route, to invest in real estate projects. In a managed account, a few large limited partners (LP) participate, instead of multiple investors in a blind pool format.So far we have got commitment of around $300 million. We will be investing in both residential and office projects, that are in early stage or under construction, Bedi said. This would be Rising Straits first fundraising after it was formed last year, following a separation between Red Fort Capital co-founders Bedi and Parry Singh. As part of the separation, Bedi sold his stake in Red Fort Capitals NBFC.There has been a slew of new real estate NBFCs entering the market. NBFCs, which primarily offer debt through various structured instruments, today are directly competing with private equity (PE) funds, with the latter mainly doing debt and non-equity deals. With NBFCs getting aggressive, real estate developers now have greater access to capital though the money comes at a high price.  NBFCs provide innovative financing and flexible repayment terms that banks typically, dont offer.

320,0.240675,"Mumbai:  I woke up early on Thursday morning and got dressed quickly to get out and convert the sole Rs500 currency note in my wallet. Typically, we journalists dont carry a lot of cash in wallets (not that our bank accounts have much either). Banks were opening after a days break and India had seen the largest currency withdrawal programme in nearly 40 years, and a moderate to large crowd was certainly expected. But then it was just one note, how long would it take to exchange? I thought while clearly underestimating the average Indians need to be first in a queue.
				   
				I thought of visiting the closest bank branch I could find in Bandra West. A sole Greater Bombay Cooperative Bank branch gave me some hope. I could see some people waiting for the bank to open so that they may feel rich again. As soon as the branch started its operations, I could see eager customers in the queue look spiffy, only to see the branch staff come out and tell them that they had not received any new currency notes and they did not have a ny new notes. The notes would only arrive after  4pm.  Six hours for a lousy Rs 500 currency note? Whats this, the iPhone 7? I muttered under my breath while angrily kicking the ground.Maybe the branch of a bigger bank might be a good idea, I thought to myself, carefully caressing the Rs500 note in my hand. I walked up to an Axis Bank branch nearby, only to find out that the staff had run out of Rs100 currency notes in the first couple of hours. The staff told all of us to come back by tomorrow to get the new Rs500 and Rs 2,000 currency notes. Maybe a public sector bank will be more amenable to my needs and ensure that I have enough liquidity to last the day before the automated teller machines (ATMs) start working from Friday. I got into an autorickshaw and asked the driver to drop me at a bank branch. Any bank branch would do, I said to myself. An Allahabad Bank branch on Pali Hill Road was the closest we could find. So I walked up to the gate, which was teeming with people at the door. Apparently they wanted my original identity proof and self-attested photocopy to ensure that my money is converted into an acceptable currency over which I shall have ownership rights again. However, I quickly moved to the neighbouring private bank ICICI Bank, thinking the documentation system would be much easier. ICICI Bank, I thought, would have a more streamlined process where the authorities wouldnt want me to give them a hundred different documents. Of course, I forgot that this withdrawal of currency was a government initiative, so every possible box for paperwork has been ticked.Besides, I had lost my old wallet only recently and all of my original government identity proofs were gone though I had the photo copies of them. The Rs500 note in my wallet was staring back at me with disdain, even as I tried to look for a way to get rid of it.The staff at the ICICI Bank branch was considerate enough to come and tell me that there was no rush to come and convert my money to the new currency on Thursday. And, I could come back anytime later in the week. Of course, I didnt tell her about my lost identity proofs, but it felt good that these options were readily available for some more time. Anyway, I was getting late for a meeting and had to leave in a hurry. Thank God! Uber does not depend only on cash payments.

15,0.2358,"Bengaluru/Mumbai: The governments clampdown on black money will have major repercussions on the real estate sector and could not have come at a worse time for developers.
				   
				The withdrawal of Rs500 and Rs1,000 denomination notes is expected to lead to a freeze in property transactions, significant cash flow issues, slower project approvals and softer prices.The move has led to considerable panic in the real estate sector that was already caught in a three-year-old slowdown. Transaction volumes are expected to come to a standstill, and developers are worried about short-term cash flows. Receivables from customers are likely to get delayed and cancellation of bookings may happen because buyers or investors may rethink as asset prices are likely to go down, said Rajeev Bairathi, executive director and head of capital markets at Knight Frank India.Cash forms a major component in most transactions in the real estate sector such as land purchases, procuring approvals from government departments or civic bodies, selling homes or plots of land and paying contractor and architect bills.To be sure, the initiative to eliminate black money aims to rid the real estate sector of corruption and lack of transparency but in the short term it is sure to add to the pain.Purchasing of land and all real estate transactions are going to be impacted. People used to park money in cash and cheque in a certain ratio, but there is going to be restriction on that, said Avneesh Sood, director, Eros Group, a Delhi-based realty firm. The number of people who want to purchase may drop and hence, sales may drastically drop. Property markets such as National Capital Region (NCR), which is mainly investor-driven and Tier II and III cities, where also cash plays a major role in transactions, are expected to be more impacted than others, property analysts said.NCR real estate developers would be the worst hit, followed by Mumbai and Bengaluru. Sales will go down dramatically and most may have to reduce prices, said a property analyst, who did not want to be named. In smaller property markets such as Surat, Ludhiana or Kochi, the difference between the Ready Reckoner rates and market value of property is wide, much more than say, Mumbai. Developers often tend to sell the properties based on the ready reckoner value, and charge the remaining amount in cash. Ready Reckoner rates are residential and commercial rates for a given area published every area by the state government. We suspect land deals will not happen for the next six months in the state. But most developers in the state have started streamlining their businesses and putting processes in place because of RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Act) which is being implemented, said Vijay Shah, promoter of Ahmedabad-based Vijay Builders Pvt. Ltd.  On Wednesday, the BSE Realty Index fell 10.23%, its steepest fall since 24 August 2015, to close at 1,324.75 points -- a level last seen on 4 May. Shares of DLF Ltd closed down 17.47% at Rs118.55 a share on the BSE, their steepest fall since 14 October 2014. Indiabulls Real Estate fell 18.51%, the steepest fall since 7 January 2009, to close at Rs65.60 a sharea level last seen on 28 April.Land deals had become speculative, because investors in residential diverted to land and office projects, when residential fared badly. The land economy thrives on cash and that is set to change. The move will also disrupt the smaller property markets, which also involve a lot of cash dealings. But in the long term, this will be a game changer for the sector, said Sanjay Dutt, chief executive, India operations, Ascendas-Singbridge India.Not just sales and prices, the cash network is deeply entrenched in the system through the approval process that every project has to go undergo.Rohit Poddar, managing director of Mumbai-based Poddar Developers Ltd said bureaucrats who take money in cash will face challenges. ...There might be a scenario where approvals may not happen on time. The maximum impact will be seen through land transactions and on the approval side, he said. In the long term, this is likely to bring more consolidation in the sector, where a large number of smaller, unorganized developers may cease to operate and the established firms may get stronger and hopefully, more transparent. Knight Franks Bairathi said foreign institutional funding in real estate will go up as a result, as risks concerning a parallel economy and cash transactions decrease.  Diwali sales were subdued under recessionary conditions, and business has dropped for many. Despite the immediate negative sentiment, consolidation is bound to happen. At least 40-50% of companies who are involved in real estate development, may stop business, said M.R.

401,0.2496,"Bengaluru: As start-up exits continue to be elusive, venture capital (VC) firms have been forced to seek more time from investors to return their money.
				   
				Most VC firms in India started out in 2006 and 2007. Now, many of them, including Nexus Venture Partners, Kalaari Capital, Matrix Partners and IDG Ventures India, have already extended or will extend the timeline of their first funds by two years to return cash to their investors, according to a dozen VC firms and limited partners (LPs) familiar with the matter. LPs are firms that invest in VC firms.Usually, LPs are happy to offer extensions, depending on the portfolio of the VC. Most people are okay hanging on for two more years, if it means a better chance at extracting more value. Usually, LPs have an option of giving or not giving an extension, but they typically exercise it positivelywhen you want to get good returns, you have to give them some time, said Mohandas Pai, chairman of Manipal Global Education and an active investor in the Indian start-up ecosystem.The first funds of most VC firms expired this year; those that havent will do so next year. Funds are usually set up as 10-year legal entities, with clauses that allow for extensions of one or two years, sometimes more.The expiry of the first funds was collectively a seminal moment of sorts for Indian VC firms. It passed unnoticed because many of the bets made by VC firms havent paid off yet and no investor wants to highlight that, the people cited above said. VC portfolios currently comprise duds, struggling companies, promising young companies and the so-called unicorns, many of whose futures are far from clear.Two VC firmsSAIF Partners India and Accel Partners Indiaboth of which began investing in India before 2006, have bucked the trend. In its first two funds totalling just $70 million, Accel uncovered gems such as Mu Sigma, Myntra and Flipkart, which have already yielded exponential returns through sales of shares to other investors. SAIF Partners similarly returned its first fund to LPs on the back of blockbuster exits through the initial public offerings of Makemytrip and JustDial. Another VC firm, Seedfund, also generated attractive returns on its first fund of $14 million, mostly because of the gains from its early bets on RedBus and Carwale.However, even for Accel and SAIF, the success of their subsequent funds is far from clear. Its also unclear if Seedfund will continue to operate after two of its partners launched their own start-ups this year.Indias start-up business began in earnest when US-based VC firms such as Sequoia Capital, Matrix Partners as well as home-grown fund managers such as Nexus Venture and Helion Venture Partners set up shop in the country in 2006 and 2007. In that period, more than 20 VC firms launched in India.Investors were testing the strength of Indias consumer Internet market and software-building capabilities.After the initial boom and bust cycles that are typical in any Internet economy, three of these VCs, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Canaan Partners, shut shop, conceding that Indian start-ups wouldnt deliver meaningful returns or that they had placed the wrong bets.Some rebranded: Erasmic Venture Fund became Accel Partners; NEA-IndoUS Ventures shed NEA from its name then became Kalaari Capital in 2012; WestBridge Capital Partners spun off from Sequoia.For the most part though, VC firms plodded along for the first seven years and then reaped the benefits of the extraordinary 2014-15 funding boom for Indian start-ups. Companies such as Flipkart, Snapdeal, Ola, Paytm, Quikr and others that comprised early bets of VC firms raised billions of dollars at eye-popping valuations.Large investors in the US, Europe and Asia, who either missed out on the record public listing of Chinas Alibaba Group or were handsomely enriched by it, together with VC firms poured more than $9 billion into Indian start-ups, believing that the mobile Internet boom would yield their next big pay-off. Some early investors in Flipkart, Snapdeal, Quikr sold part of their stakes and realized massive gains. Three large acquisitions (Freecharge, Myntra and TaxiForSure) strengthened the theory that India start-ups will finally deliver exits.Traditional VC firms raised billions of dollars in new funds. And, why not? Their portfolios showed the kind of paper gains that would fill any LP with confidence.However, the rapid expansion of Amazon India and Uber India caught Flipkart, Snapdeal and Ola by shock (bit.ly/2dkf8J0). Most importantly, though Indias Internet market is huge in terms of number of users, but making money from these users is another matter altogether (mintne.ws/1TYtIRu).These two factors together with other smaller ones have shown that many of the investments made by VC firms in 2015 are simply unviable and the future of the VC scene in its current form hangs in the balance.To be sure, most investors are still sanguine about Indias Internet economy. The mobile Internet boom that is being turbocharged by the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd will attract hundreds of millions of potential new customers for start-ups. Ola has shown this year that it can hold its own against Uber; Flipkart, too, finally seems to be in the early stages of a turnaround. Plus, theres hope among investors that some newer investments such as enterprise product or SaaS (software as a service) start-ups will pay off.Its true that things havent gone according to plan, but LPs are still very positive about India. They realize it will take longer, but they also believe that India is a market you cannot ignore. They will continue supporting VCs. There are only a few blue-chip VCs out there, so I dont expect (a shakeout), a managing director at a VC firm said.None of the VC firms and LPs Mint contacted for this story spoke on the record.mihir.d@livemint.com",2016-11-10,uV83c63pJGmVDYxeZUXTVJ,"Amid a bleak exit scenario, VC firms are extending the timeline of their funds by two years",00:05,VC firms seek more time to return money to investors

275,0.245875,"Tata Sons Ltd on Thursday accused ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry of betraying the trust it had reposed in him and seeking to control the main operating companies of the Tata group to the exclusion of Tata Sons and other Tata representatives.
				   
				Mistrys aides issued a rebuttal saying the Tata Sons statement reflects desperation.It is unfortunate that Tata Sons, acting in good faith, did not anticipate such devious moves by Mr. Mistry and thereby did not inform the other directors of the operating companies about its dissatisfaction with Mr. Mistry at the level of Tata Sons. However, we will now do whatever is required to deal with this situation, the group holding company said in a statement.It added that Tata Sons had expected Mistry to resign as chairman of the group operating companies once he was ousted as chairman of the holding company and his refusal demonstrates his absolute disregard of longstanding Tata traditions, values and ethos.This is the first time since removing Mistry on 24 October that Tata Sons has elaborated on the ostensible reasons for his ouster. Since then, the independent directors of Indian Hotels Co. Ltd (IHCL) and Tata Chemicals Ltd have backed Mistry.Pointing to the first instance, the Tata note said this reveal the true colours of Mr. Mistry and his ulterior objective. It accused him of trying to gain control of IHCL by ensuring he would be the only Tata Sons representative on its board over the years. The statement said this seems to have been Mistrys strategy, planned and executed over the past four years.A person close to Mistry refuted charges of an ulterior motive of taking control of companies. He said giving the example of Indian Hotels only because independent directors, one of whom is also a director of Tata Trust, demonstrated true independence, is not in keeping with Tata governance standards, the person said.A look at the board composition of the top six listed Tata group firms where Mistry is chairman shows at least half the board was appointed before 2012, when he took charge. The Tata statement, which runs into nine pages, also cited falling dividend income and increasing impairment provisions, ballooning debt and low return on investments as reasons for removing him as chairman of the $103 billion group.Tata Sons also alleged that under Mistry, the edifice of the group founded in 1868 had been consciously dismantled, resulting in operating companies drifting away from the promoter company and their shareholders.With the exception of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), dividends received from all 40 other firms (many non-dividend paying) in its portfolio have continuously declined from Rs1,000 crore in 2012-13 to Rs780 crore in 2015-16 but the latter figure includes additional interim dividend of Rs100 crores which would have been normally received in 2016-17 (due to budgetary changes), the statement said. It added that in the past four years, the groups debt had increased by Rs69,877 crore to over Rs2.25 trillion.Despite huge investments by firms, the returns are not visible in increased profits, though, in all fairness, some major growth projects like the new steel plant at Kalinganagar will show results only in coming years, the statement said.The person close to Mistry said the Tata Sons statement had selective data, unsubstantiated claims and half truths, without a word of explanation as to why it became necessary to remove him summarily, violating natural justice and without explanation.This person pointed to the high operating profit margin of 14% for Tata Steel Europe in 2014 and the narrowing losses in the Mundra power project (admittedly because of lower coal prices) as examples of improvement under Mistry. This was the largest turnaround in Indian corporate history involving multiple companies and is still a work in progress, said this person.Proxy advisory firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS) said the Tata statement is inconsistent.You cant blame him (Mistry) for non-performance of one company and not give any credit for the good show of the other, said Amit Tandon, IiAS founder and managing director. Mistrys aide cited earlier said the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of Tata Sons lauded his performance on 28 June and its report was adopted by the entire board. Tata Sons is yet to state what necessitated the replacement of Mr. Mistry on October 24 without any notice or an opportunity to defend himself, this person said.

				 TidalScale creates computing architecture for customers trying to solve large computing problems. This is Bengaluru-based Infosyss 10th investment in a start-up from its $500 million innovation fund, though only the third this calendar year, even as the pace of investments in startups and buyouts has considerably slowed down. Homegrown IT firms, including Infosys and Wipro Ltd, are tapping start-ups in an effort to get products based on new technologies faster to the market and serve the emerging needs of their customers.As a pioneer of SoftwareDefined Servers, TidalScale provides solutions that are extraordinarily simple to use, requiring absolutely no changes to existing operating systems, databases, or applications, said Ritika Suri, executive vice-president of corporate development and ventures at Infosys. Among our client base, we see a need for inventive and cost-effective approaches to derive business value from big data, and our investment in TidalScale underscores our commitment to our clients to bring innovative new solutions across our platforms and offerings.Nassi was chief scientist at SAP and is credited with having started its Global Business Incubator when Sikka was the chief technology officer at the German software firm. In addition to being the chairman at TidalScale, Nassi is also on the board of advisors of the non-profit Viewpoints Research Institute, run by Alan Kay, Sikkas friend and mentor. Nassi quit SAP in October 2011. Infosys has surprisingly shied away from buyouts over the last year, despite spending $390 million to buy three firms in the first year of Sikkas tenure. Since Sikka set aside $500 million to invest in start-ups at the beginning of last year. It has spent more than $33 million on investments in nine start-ups and buying a stake in a venture capital firm.Last year Infosys spent more than $200 million to buy Panaya Inc., an automation firm in which Sikkas mentor and SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner was an investor.

420,-0.203725,"Mumbai: Indias withdrawal of larger banknotes from circulation is sparking a surge in cash deposits and raising hopes the added liquidity will allow banks to lower lending rates more aggressively.
				   
				Lower lending rates have long been seen as a needed boost to Indias economy, which grew at a 15-month low in the April-June quarter, in part due to a dearth of corporate investment.Tuesdays withdrawal of Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes, aimed at curbing corruption and counterfeit currency, has sparked long lines of people looking to exchange their worthless notes.State Bank of India (SBI), Indias largest lender by assets, said on Friday it had already received Rs18,000 crore ($2.68 billion) in savings and current account deposits since Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the measure.Also Read: Why are ATMs still out of service and out of cash ?Economists at SBI estimate banks will receive an influx of Rs5,07,000 crore in cash, of which 10% is likely to be left at lenders. That type of influx could allow banks to lower their deposit rates, and in turn, their lending ratesproviding a vital deployment of credit.What I do in a month, Ive done in a day, said SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya, regarding the influx of low-cost deposits. Surely the cost of funds is something that is going to ease, she said, adding the bank believed that would result in a fall in lending rates.Banking shares have surged, with SBI up 11.3% in the two days after the announcement, although it fell 3% on Friday.Also Read: Rs500, Rs1000 note ban: Tax evaders engaging in illegal transactions on I-T dept radarMuch will depend on how many deposits end up actually coming in, but there is room for hope. Unlike their western counterparts, deposits account for the majority of Indian bank funds, with total deposits of Rs99,63,000 crore ($1.5 trillion) as of 14 October, according to central bank data.RBI officials have long expressed frustration that banks are lowering their lending rates too slowly, even after the central bank moved to cut interest rates by 175 basis points since early 2015 and injected liquidity more aggressively.Also Read: Can you game the Rs4,000 daily cash limit?By contrast, lending rates have come down by an average of just over 100 basis points during that period.R.K. Takkar, chief executive of state-run UCO Bank, said lower lending rates were just a matter of time. Under the so-called marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) rules passed by the RBI this year, lenders must more quickly reflect changes in deposit rates in their lending rates. All the banks are reviewing MCLR every month. Once my cost of funds go down, deposit rates are reduced, MCLR will also go down. Thats in-built in the system. Reuters",2016-11-11,wQ3wvnnUsu644fZ0Tj1OHN,"SBI said on Friday it had already received Rs18,000 crore in savings and current account deposits since Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the measure",18:41,"Ban on Rs500, Rs 1000 notes provides a boon to struggling Indian banks"
274,0.2495,"Tim Davie, director, global, and chief executive at BBC Worldwide, the commercial arm of British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), was in New Delhi  as part of the group of executives that came for the India-UK Tech Summit.  
				   
				In an interview, Davie talks about BBC Worldwides revenues, potential of the Indian market and the companys joint venture with Sony Pictures Network to launch a new infotainment channel, Sony BBC Earth.  Edited excerpts:BBC Worldwide monetizes BBC brands and programmes. How big is BBCs brands business?Critically, we are separate from the news business. We are in the content business and we work on co-producing and distributing programmes around the world. We are a profitable organization, doing just a bit more than £1 billion in revenue. In terms of cash returns, we returned over £200 million to BBC group last year.What kind of content do you focus on?We often focus on content largely originating from British creatives. In the area of factual programming, we do programmes like natural history documentaries. In entertainment, we have programmes like Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa in India; we have produced that in over 50 countries. Most of our sales are in drama and fiction, whether it is Sherlock or Doctor Who. In the UK, we are the biggest drama distributor, and outside the US, we have the biggest catalogue of television programmes.Which are your best markets? If you are in the media business, the US is the biggest market and that holds true for us as well. We have a big business with BBC America, plus we produce Dancing with the Stars for ABC Network. Outside that, we tend to work well in markets where there is a deep cordial connection or historic ties with the English language or the UK. We are into markets like Australia, Singapore and also places like India where obviously the cordial connection is so strong. We have an amazing growth area in India. India and the UK have common cultural ties that go to our programming and are not just limited to cricket.What are your expectations from India?India currently contributes under 5% to our global revenues. This is a market where we are going to see continued growth. We have three primary businesses in Indiaproduction, TV sales and digital sales, and what we are really looking forward to is launching a channel in India. It will be a joint venture with Sony Pictures Network. The channel will be called Sony BBC Earth and focus on natural history, science and adventure. It will showcase international content. We are currently waiting for government approvals.There is no doubt that the media market in India is set for continued growth. I cant give you an exact number, but the potential here is significant.Globally, what is the most striking trend in the media and entertainment industry?From a broadcasting perspective, there is huge growth in dramaglobal drama and fiction. There has been unstoppable growth in the industry of scripted dramas like Sherlock. There is an appetite for cut-through content that makes a real difference. Like Sherlockpeople are hungry for the next episode.In music, live music and music streaming is growing. This kind of content is not available on demand or on YouTube. We did a live special with Adele in London, which sold brilliantly around the world. We are seeing a more event-based programming in music.How rapidly is BBC Worldwide growing?Last year, our revenues grew at 6.7%, profit was broadly 3-4%, but we sold a part of BBC America. I cant say about the targets, but we have promised to return £1.2 billion to our shareholders in the next five years. We are looking for over 20% growth in the next five years.How big is BBCs digital division? In US, we have announced that we are going over-the-top with a BBC service that people will be able to subscribe to. Separately, in places like Singapore, we have a BBC Player where people can access certain content. So, clearly, we are not constrained or limited by a linear channel.There are a lot of opportunities for us in India as well.Where is the future of digitalin advertising or behind a paywall?It would be presumptuous at this point to say definitely that one model works and the other doesnt. It depends on the content. I will say, in our experience in the digital market, it certainly seems that subscription services are for long-form programming. It has its attraction to the consumers.But that doesnt mean we have a hardened policy in this area. We are light on our toes and have to be flexible towards the market.",2016-11-11,aNlSyx6u7kkwMjESbc2CqN,BBC Worldwide chief executive Tim Davie on the potential of the Indian market and the firms joint venture with Sony Pictures Network to launch a new infotainment channel,00:40,BBC has an amazing growth area in India: Tim Davie

416,0.166075,"New Delhi: Putting speculation to rest, filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali joined hands with Viacom18 Motion Pictures for his epic project Padmavati in October. Scheduled for a 17 November, 2017 release, the estimated budget of the Ranveer Singh, Shahid Kapoor and Deepika Padukone-starrer is around Rs180 crore, making it one of Indias most expensive movie productions, said trade experts who declined to be named. About Rs150 crore has been set aside for production and the remaining for promotions, advertising and other expenses.
				   
				Media reports in the past two months suggested that the film would mark the unique collaboration of two major Bollywood corporate housesEros International that had backed the previous two films directed by Bhansali, Bajirao Mastani and Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela, and Viacom with which he had co-produced Mary Kom and Gabbar Is Back. But Eros backed out of the deal in October, industry experts say, because of a financial crunch. Eros International Plc.s stock has fallen since August this year. Its shares, as of Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, reads last traded at $18.13 apiece, down from $19.23 apiece on 8 August . Bombay Stock Exchange listed Eros International Media Ltd stock witnessed a sharper fall in the same period, falling to Rs176.90 on Friday from Rs230 apiece on 8 August. Padmavati is the second film that Eros has let go of recently; it earlier backed out of Ajay Devgn-starrer Shivaay, which also had a budget of over Rs100 crore. The studio declined to comment for this story.The deal makes sense for Viacom despite the massive budget, say trade experts. For one, it involves Bhansali, who is riding high on the Rs184 crore net box office collections of Bajirao Mastani. A director is always assured a budget equal to the recovery that his last film made. The challenge is to go beyond that and there is always about 10-20% risk for the studio involved, said Jayantilal Gada, chairman of film-producing and presenting company Pen India. Plus with him (Bhansali), its a case of take it or leave it. Look at any of his films and you can see the money spent on every scene, they are all meant to be big screen experiences.To be sure though, in absolute terms, Padmavati will have to equal the Rs500 crore plus gross collections of war epic Baahubali: The Beginning to recover the investment, said Atul Mohan, editor of trade magazine Complete Cinema, given obstacles like rising ticket prices and rampant piracy in the movie business.He is a very sensible director and you definitely need these larger-than-life films once in a while to provide variety for audiences. But the Indian box office is highly unpredictable and a big-budget film gone wrong can totally break a studio as the examples of Mohenjo Daro and Bombay Velvet show, Mohan said. Viacom shelled out about Rs40 crore for the satellite rights of Bhansalis Bajirao Mastani. The Rs150 crore production budget for Padmavati means that Viacom will spend about Rs75 crore from its own funds and the remaining will come as loans from banks. A mere Rs35 crore extra would give them rights to a Bhansali film that would, as most people agree, stand a class apart. Plus there are a variety of revenue streams available for Viacom to recover its investment in Padmavati.Earlier films were dependent on theatrical, music and satellite rights for earnings. Now there is such a huge revenue proposition in the form of digital apps, every mobile is a shop now, said Sanjay Bhandari, a financial adviser to the film industry.Viacom especially stands to benefit thanks to its video-on-demand service Voot, a joint venture with Reliance Industries Ltd, which in September launched its telecom operation. The studio remained unavailable for comment.Producers arent just looking at recovery on the table now, at least 30-40% of the recovery happens after the release.

When there are restrictions on withdrawal of cash in the aftermath of demonetization of notes, usage of payment cards at PoS for all day-to-day purchases is the ideal way to transact, said A. P. Hota, managing director and chief executive officer, NPCI.RuPay is enabled on all three channelsATMs, PoS and e-commerce channels. India has 14 lakh PoS terminals and all the terminals accept all brands of debit and credit cards. The use of RuPay cards at the e-commerce channel has also been growing rapidly. It can be used for booking railway tickets and bus tickets, shopping on the internet or paying bills and taxes.The usage of Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) and Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has also doubled. IMPS and UPI are 24x7 remittance services.NPCI officially launched the UPI in April, allowing banks to develop applications in a way that will let customers instantly transfer money to each other.

HDFC Banks market value was at Rs3,25,210.41 crore while its shares closed at Rs1,275.70 on Friday, down 0.04% from previous close. Year to date, the script rose 17.82%.On 25 October, HDFC Bank reported a steady 20% net profit growth of Rs3,455.33 crore boosted by higher net interest income and other incomes.Investors are considering its robust growth profile, superior asset quality and ability to gain market share, said Motilal Oswal, chairman and managing director of brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd , in his 25 October report to its investors.HDFC Bank is well positioned in the current environment, and with strong capacity building amid moderate growth cycle and significant digitalization initiatives, the bank is well placed to benefit from the expected pick-up in economic growth cycle, the report added.Shares of RIL fell 0.9% to Rs1,001.40, after which the companys market value stood at about Rs3,24,791.58 crore.

Ltds (ONGCs) deep-water block in the Krishna-Godavari basin for seven years.However, RIL said it is planning to initiate arbitration against the government. RIL remains convinced of being able to fully justify and vindicate its position that the governments claim is not sustainable, the company said in a emailed statement on 4 November.We felt that the penalty, if any, that RIL could be liable to pay should be limited to the net cumulative earnings before interest and taxes (Ebit) earned by it from the disputed volumes, which we had estimated at Rs16 billion.

310,-0.13485,"New Delhi: Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Thursday that his ministry was assessing the actions of former officials at Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) and upstream regulator, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), since 2007 relating to a dispute between the state-run company and Reliance Industries Ltd around flow of gas between their connected reservoirs in the Krishna-Godavari basin.
				   
				Once the assessment is completed, the ministry is expected to bring provisions to penalize energy firms for not disclosing all material information to the regulator at various stages of field development and give DGH more enforcement powers and technical expertise.Also, the ministry may take action if any individual official is found guilty of suppressing relevant information.These measures were recommended by the single-member justice A.P. Shah committee that looked into ONGCs claim that Reliance gained by producing gas from their connected reservoirs.There must be clarity on what roles the stakeholders played (relating to the dispute.) We should have transparency. We are making an internal assessment. We will bring to light whoever is responsible, Pradhan said at the economic editors conference in the capital.The Shah panel also said that the government should probe ONGCs alleged long periods of inactivity in developing the blocks awarded to it. ONGC chairman and managing director D.K. Sarraf said on 8 September that the company came to know that the reservoirs of the two companies in the KG basin were connected only in 2013, the year in which it approached the DGH on the issue. Sarraf also said then that the company had informed the Shah committee that it had no prior knowledge about flow of gas between the fields, but there was no mention of its submission in the panels report.The panel said, citing a report by DeGolyer & MacNaughton, a US-based consultancy that was hired earlier by the firms, that between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2015, about 11 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas migrated to KG D6 from adjacent fields, of which 8.9 bcm was appropriated by RIL. In a stock exchange filing on 5 November, Reliance contested the $1.5 billion claim the government made on the same day relating to the gas that seeped into its field, saying the company had worked within the boundaries of the block awarded to it and has complied with all applicable regulations and provisions of its lease.Disputes relating to natural resources do not augur well for the development of the sector.

Since it is a three step merger process and Max Financial Services, which is an NBFC, is also involved in the scheme, Irda wants to ensure that at no stage any amalgamation is happening between Max Financial and any insurance company.

				The company had made a pilot-run for the nations first LNG powered bus in Thiruvananthapuram last week and hopes to launch first in Kerala. The company had unveiled the first LNG truck at the Delhi Auto Expo 2014. If all goes well, we are planning the commercial launch next April. We are working overtime to get regulatory approvals including those from Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), Tata Motors engineering head Ajit Jindal said. He, however, denied the plans that the company has inked an agreement with Kerala. We have not signed any agreement with Kerala as yet or any other state. Kerala is keen to place an order for 1,000 buses with us and we have offered to make 10% of that (100) to be LNG-powered, Jindal said. He said these fully-built buses will be produced at its Lucknow plant, where it makes the CNG buses also, and the body will be built at its Dharwar plant. Going forward, if the demand is good, we can also offer just chassis, he said. When asked about the advantages of LNG over CNG in terms ownership cost for a customer, he said there is no significant cost advantage over CNG, but coastal states can gain considerably from fuel transportation cost. From the point of view of diesel, the gains are huge as cost of ownership will be cheaper by around 30%, while acquisition cost may be higher by Rs4-5 lakh, he added. In terms of ease of usage, the LNG buses offer a great advantage over CNG variants as the dead weight of a CNG cylinder and that of a cryogenic cylinder is huge apart from very low filling time, he said. With a full tank, an LNG bus can run as much as 700 km in one filling, while a CNG bus can at best deliver just about 200 km per cylinder, Jindal said. He also said an LNG-powered bus (Tata LPO1613) is lighter in weight compared to buses powered by conventional fuels and has enhanced levels of payload.Jindal said they have not spent too much on developing this bus which will be sold initially as fully built units of 9 meters or 35 seaters, and 12 meters or 50 seaters, the engines are same as that of its CNG buses. About fuel supply, Jindal said the company is talking to Petronet LNG Ltd and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd to set up special filling stations. But again, he said, no agreement has been reached between them.

Banks have introduced a slew of relaxations for making it easier for the customers, including extending the banking hours and keeping branches open on the weekend. According to a report, Rs60,000 crore was deposited into accounts till Friday evening, which will only ride up with time.

45,-0.2453,"Over the past few years, several policymakers have been heard complaining that Indian firms are not investing enough. The latest data on asset sales provides a clear and stark answer for that phenomenon: the Indian economy is currently going through the biggest deleveraging of the past quarter century, if not the biggest in history.
				   
				Data sourced from Thomson Reuters Eikon show that Indian companies have sold more assets in 2016 than they have in any year since liberalization. It is no wonder then that private investments have been tepid as the deleveraging process picked up pace over the past year or so. The data shows that asset-sale deals announced, pending or completed in 2016 are worth $40.85 billion. This beats the previous peak of $27.96 billion announced in 2007 by a wide margin. The Reuters data covers any tangible asset, branch, division, operations or subsidiary sold off by a parent firm.While the previous peak was driven by demand from investors who wanted a stake in the India growth story, the current round of asset sales has been driven largely by distress of indebted corporations. Essar features in the list of top deals in both 2007 and 2016. The top deals in 2007 include Vodafones acquisition of Hutchison Essar and Matsushita Electric Works acquisition of Anchor Electricals. The top deals of 2016 include the sale of controlling stake in Essar Oil to PJSC Rosneft Oil Co by the heavily indebted Essar group, and UltraTech Cement Ltds acquisition of Jaypee Groups cement assets. However, in terms of completed deals, 2016 has seen lower amount of such deals compared to previous years but that is largely because many of the asset sales are yet to receive regulatory approvals.As the charts below show, the asset sales have been led by stressed firms in the debt-laden sectors of the Indian economy such as energy, real estate, and metals. Many of the leading firms in these sectors are owned by some of the most indebted corporate groups of the country.The debt overhang of Indias corporate sector has been many years in the making and the unwinding of debt is taking almost as much time as the accumulation of debt. The seeds of the current debt problems were sown during the effervescent lending of the boom years in the mid-2000s. The credit boom leading up to the great global financial crash of 2008 witnessed a dilution of lending norms by banks and an aggressive asset-buying spree by Indian corporations. The financial crash brought an end to such excesses, and the boom turned to bust. In a 2012 report, Credit Suisse pointed out that the borrowings of the top 10 indebted conglomerates in the country (which included Essar, Reliance ADAG, Vedanta, Adani and the Jaypee group) had grown five times in the five years leading up to 2012 to Rs5.4 trillion, which equalled 13% of total bank loans.Even then, delayed recognition of bad loans by banks and regulatory forbearance by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) ensured that indebted firms and conglomerates did not face the pressures of paying back their debts that they are faced with today. In a 2015 update of their original report, Credit Suisse pointed out that the total borrowings of the top 10 indebted groups stood at Rs7.3 trillion.Thanks to tightening of norms related to restructuring of assets, and greater power provided to lenders to recover dues, promoters have been forced to consider selling distressed assets and subsidiaries to retire some of their debt. Some of the top deals of the past year feature firms owned by the top 10 indebted corporate groups and other large indebted conglomerates.But does this years asset-selling spree signal an end to Indias debt woes? Most analysts suggest that is unlikely. In fact, the debt problem has become more acute for companies which are not able to meet their interest obligations or have an interest cover less than 1. Contrary to expectations of a recovery in stressed companies, the share of debt with interest cover (IC) saw a slight increase up to 39% vs 38%. The share of chronically stressed companies also increased to 34% vs 32% QoQ, and 30% (vs 34%) debt was with loss-making companies, noted a 19 September Credit Suisse report by analysts Ashish Gupta, Kush Shah and Prashant Kumar. Bankers have pointed out that cash from many asset sales is only enough to stay out of debt trouble for a year or so. And once cash-generating assets have been sold, it could lead to fresh problems for indebted groups as the cash from the deals run out. It is likely that bankers or promoters, or more likely both, would have to take a hit in the coming quarters. A 20 September Religare Capital Markets Ltd report, which examined six steel companies to analyse their debt servicing capability, noted that EBITDA (or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) would have to triple for these companies to be able to meet their debt obligations. Given the limited upsides to EBITDA (ex-sale of non-core assets), we believe debt servicing will be possible only post a 35-40% loan haircut by banks, said the report authored by analysts Pritesh Jani, Parag Jariwala and Vikesh Mehta. The continuing spectre of further deleveraging seems to have affected risk appetite across the economy. As the chart below shows, cash levels have witnessed a rise for Indian firms after the crash of 2008 even though indebted firms have lagged others. Yet, the hangover of debt and the turning of the credit cycle seems to be deterring firms from making new investments.The tepid investment climate has affected overall demand in the economy and in turn hurt the debt-servicing capabilities of the indebted groups, analysts say.Indias debt issues will not be solved without an improvement in growth or a pick-up in demand, said V.

126,0.23455,"New Delhi: With long lines before automated teller machines (ATMs) and bank branches to withdraw and exchange currency notes continuing on Sunday, the government allowed higher withdrawal and exchange limits to make the transition easier. Banks have also been instructed to ensure that lower-denomination notes are easily made available to customers.
				   
				The government also sought to step up efforts to ensure adequate availability of cash in rural areas, which typically have fewer bank branches and ATMs.Customers can now exchange Rs4,500 for old bank notes at bank counters, compared to the existing ceiling of Rs4,000. The limit on cash withdrawals from recalibrated ATMs has also been increased to Rs2,500 from Rs2,000.The weekly limit of Rs20,000 for withdrawal from bank accounts has been raised  to Rs24,000, the finance ministry said in a statement. Bank notes in the new Rs500 denomination will also be available from now, the statement added.Since the government announced partial demonetization, declaring existing 500 and 1,000 rupee notes illegal, around Rs3 trillion worth of currencies of these denominations have been deposited in banks, against Rs50,000 crore which has been withdrawn through ATMs and from bank branches. The government estimates that around Rs14 trillion of these old high denomination notes are still in circulation.To ensure last mile access to funds to people living in remote rural areas, chief secretaries of states have been asked to identify rural areas where cash is a problem and work with banks to ensure that mobile banking vans and business correspondents help the people access cash.Further, the cash withdrawal  at business correspondents have also been increased to Rs2,500. Arrangements have also been made for separate queues for the elderly and differently abled.The government has also increased the last date for submission of the annual life certificate for government pensioners to 15 January from November end.Since cancelling the existing 500 and 1000 rupee notes, the government, Reserve Bank of India and the banks have struggled to meet the demand for cash and put in place the backend infrastructure. There have been long queues at bank branches and unavailability of cash at ATMs. On Saturday, finance minister Arun Jaitley had said that it will take around 2-3 weeks for the ATMs to be recalibrated to dispense the new Rs500 and Rs2000 notes, appealing to people to visit banks only to meet urgent requirements.",2016-11-14,GbxSAgkKMCp9c0iSLMM7XP,"Customers can now exchange Rs4,500 for old bank notes at banks, compared to  Rs4,000 and can withdraw from Rs2,500 from ATMs, from the earlier Rs2,000",01:00,"Cash withdrawal limit for ATMs, currency exchange increased "
97,-0.105375,"Mumbai: The US-based stressed asset specialist Lone Star Funds has applied to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to set up an asset reconstruction company (ARC) with an eye on the massive bad loan-related opportunity in India, three people aware of the development said.
				   
				They have been scouting the Indian market for the last couple of months for stressed assets opportunities in the power and infrastructure sectors. As part of their strategy to tap this opportunity they have applied to RBI for setting up an ARC, said one of the three persons cited above, requesting anonymity as he is not authorized to speak to reporters.The ARC will be part of an India platform that Lone Star is looking to build, said the second person mentioned above. They are in the process of setting up a team to manage stressed infra assets in India. They are also looking to raise a new fund currently, a significant part of which will likely be dedicated to India, he added.Lone Star Funds declined to comment on the development. Lone Star is a global private equity firm that invests in real estate, equity, credit and other financial assets. Since the establishment of its first fund in 1995, Lone Star has raised 16 PE funds with aggregate capital commitments totalling over $65 billion, according to the funds website.Lone Star seeks opportunities in markets where liquidity is restricted and financing is constrained, where balance sheets of financial institutions are in stress and there is a need to dispose of high volumes of assets to manage capital, deleverage and build liquidity.Mint reported 19 October that Lone Star is in discussions with infrastructure conglomerate GMR Group to acquire a significant stake in GMR Chhattisgarh Energy Ltd, a unit of GMR Energy Ltd.With its plans to start an ARC, Lone Star joins the ranks of funds and financial services institutions that are looking to tap the huge bad loans mess that faces the Indian banking system. The gross bad loans of 39 listed Indian banks, in absolute terms, rose 92% in fiscal 2016 to Rs5.79 trillion.The Lone Star move comes after the government, seeking to resolve problem of mounting bad loans in Indias banking sector, decided in May to allow foreign institutions to fully own ARCs.Although local banks have trillions of rupees worth of bad loans on their books, the capital lying with existing ARCs in India is enough to buy only a fraction of the stressed assets available.Indias attempt to rid its banking sector of stressed assets is providing an opportunity for those with experience and the funds to turn around assets. Amongst those who have applied for setting up ARCs are global stressed asset specialist JC Flowers and Co., in partnership with Ambit Holdings Pvt. Ltd,  domestic financial services firm IIFL Holdings Ltd and Sudhir Valia, the former chief financial officer of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.Other global private equity funds, such as KKR and Co., Hong Kong-based SSG Capital Management and International Finance Corp. (IFC), the investment arm of the World Bank, have already acquired stakes in existing ARCs to buy bad loans.In January 2015, IFC invested in Encore Asset Reconstruction Co. Pvt. Ltd.  In March this year, the Foreign Investment Promotion Board gave approval to KKR & Co. for picking up a stake in International Asset Reconstruction Co. Pvt. Ltd.Most recently, ICICI Bank Ltd, State Bank of India (SBI) and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. announced plans to launch joint ventures to invest in stressed assets.In July, the countrys largest lender SBI tied up with Brookfield Asset Management Inc. to form a join venture fund for purchasing distressed assets.

				We will open two Panda Express outlets in Bangalore next year, said Jay Singh, co-founder and executive director, JSM. Panda Express operates over 1,800 outlets across six countries.Currently, JSM has 26 outlets and six brands in its portfolio, which include restaurants such as Shiro, The Big Kahuna, Ginger Tiger and Asilo, a rooftop bar in Mumbai. We will soon introduce a new restaurant format as well, said Singh, refusing to divulge further details.Celebrating 10 years of Hard Rock Cafe in India, the company is also hoping to add two more outlets to the international chain which contributes almost 40-45% to JSMs overall revenues. JSM clocked a revenue of Rs200 crore in the year ended March 2016.However, Singh added that the growth has slowed for the past few months.Rajat Wahi, partner and head (consumer markets) at consulting firm KPMG, agreed that restaurants have been facing consumption challenge since a few months. However, the sentiment in the market is changing and consumption might improve in the times to come. The restaurateurs are trying to figure out the problems behind consumption decline, he said.Earlier in April, JSM had announced that it was planning to raise Rs200 crore to expand the number of current outlets in India and to bring in new international brands. However, the company has put its plans on hold due to negativity around the food sector, said Singh.We were trying to raise funds almost a year ago but we had to pull out our plans because of unfavourable economic environment, said Singh, adding that the company is currently focusing on introducing new restaurant formats in the country.According to a study VCEdge Funding Insights by News Corp. VCCircle, investments in food and agriculture businesses hit a five-year low in 2016.The food and agriculture sectors have so far seen a total investment of $250 million in 2016, a 78% decline from 2015 (full year). Total fund inflow touched a five-year low after the sector received $523 million of investments in 2014, $406 million in 2013 and $435 million in 2012, according to the study.There have been only 62 deals in the sector in 2016, as compared with 153 in 2015, the study said.The Indian food and beverage industry is expected to reach Rs3.8 trillion in sales by 31 March 2017, expanding at a rate of 24%, according to a 2015 report by consulting firm Grant Thornton India and lobby group Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).",2016-11-14,MAXer4BMeEwb0hDEmN6AbO,"JSM is also hoping to add two more outlets of Hard Rock Café, which contributes 40-45% to the companys overall revenues",09:38,Hard Rock Cafe firm to launch fast food chain Panda Express in India by March 
410,0.22605,"Sydney: Australia should follow Indias lead and scrap its biggest bank notes, UBS Group AG said.
				   
				Removing large denomination notes in Australia would be good for the economy and good for the banks, UBS analysts led by Jonathan Mott said in a note to clients on Monday. Benefits would include reduced crime and welfare fraud, increased tax revenue and a spike in bank deposits, he said.The report came after India last week banned its existing Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes as part of a crackdown on tax evasion and the black economy that the government hopes will force people to declare unaccounted income and boost tax coffers. The government is issuing newly designed Rs500 and Rs2,000 bills with additional security features to deter counterfeiters.In Australia, 92% of all currency by value is in A$50 and A$100 notes, the larger of which is rarely seen, according to the UBS report. Removing bigger denominations would boost digital payments in a country where the use of cash payments is continuing to fall, the analysts wrote.Since 2009, ATM transactions in Australia have fallen 3.4% a year, while credit-card transactions have increased 7.3 % a year, UBS said.The programme would also be positive for banks. If all the A$100 notes were deposited into accounts at the lenders, household deposits would rise by about 4%, the UBS analysts said. That would likely be enough to fill the big banks regulatory-mandated net stable funding ratios and reduce reliance on offshore funding, they said.The European Central Bank in February said it was considering withdrawing 500-euro notes because of an increased conviction in world public opinion such high-value notes are used for criminal purposes.

70,0.248325,"Mumbai: With the government having de-legalized Rs500 and Rs1,000 bank notes, there is mounting interest in electronic payment mechanisms, with mobile payment firms Paytm, Ola Money and Mobikwik reporting increased downloads of their apps.
				   
				The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), on its part, has also been goading people to use electronic modes of payments.Such usage will alleviate pressure on the physical currency and also enhance the experience of living in the digital world, RBI had said on Saturday.Is India ready to go fully cashless then? The short answer is no. The long answer, is slightly more nuanced, but still a no. A look at the cashless payment infrastructure tell us why this is so.As of 30 September, the number of point of sale (PoS) devices, which accepted debit and credit cards as modes of payments at merchant outlets, was only 1.49 million, RBIs monthly bulletin shows. Still, the number is higher than the 1.38 million reported on 31 March. These outlets include railway stations, airports, hospital counters and supermarkets.In comparison, Indians had nearly 730 million debit cards and 27 million credit cards at September end. It isnt clear, however, how many people have more than one card.These debit cards in the system also include about 200 million RuPay cards linked to over 250 million bank accounts under the Prime Ministers Jan Dhan Yojana. So far, about 24% of Jan Dhan accounts have zero balance, as reported by the financial inclusion movements website. And, according to a 13 September report by The Indian Express, 18 public sector banks and their 16 regional rural subsidiaries had just over 10 million accounts with only Rs1 in them, as bankers try to cut down the number of zero balance accounts under them.An even better indicator would be the money that is spent at these terminals. According to RBI data, people used debit cards to make nearly 1.2 billion transactions worth Rs1.6 trillion across India in FY16.While the transactions and amount may seem high, India also used debit cards to make over 8 billion transactions worth Rs 25.37 trillion at automated teller machines (ATMs) during that period. These were mostly cash withdrawals and some transfers made to other accounts and credit card bills.Credit cards recorded 785 million transactions on PoS terminals, where an amount of over Rs2.4 trillion was spent. It is clear then that India is largely using its plastic cards to withdraw cash, which it spends later.Mobile wallets, where services such as Paytm, Mobikwik and Ola Money offer ease of transaction to customers are still in the starting phase of adoption as only around one-fifth of Indias population has a smartphone where these services can be used. According to GSMA Intelligence, a mobile operator database, there were about 275 million smartphones in India as of June.RBIs monthly bulletin points out mobile wallets were used to make 604 million transactions in FY16 by customers who spent about Rs20.6 billion. Mobile bankingor transactions done via applications provided by banks to transfer money, pay utility bills and check balancesrecorded 390 million transactions worth over Rs4 trillion. Unified Payments Interface (UPI), the National Payments Corporation of Indias (NPCIs) ambitious payments interface which enables person-to-person transactions without the need to exchange sensitive bank account information is yet to fully take off. While NPCI has been able to sign up 26 banks to the UPI platform, which went live in August, the number of downloads and transactions hasnt picked up. Only about 20-25% of all transactions that happen in India are cashless. With this demonetization drive, we should see this rising and people opting for mobile wallets more. However, it is true the infrastructure for acceptance is still an issue that needs to be overcome. Possibly, this would be the time for improving that, said Karthik Srinivasan, senior vice-president, ICRA Ltd.Another factor that works against cashless transactions is the perceived security problems. Last month, details of about 32 million cards were likely to have been compromised due to a security breach in an ATM network. This led to State Bank of India (SBI) issuing 600,000 new cards to customers who could have been victims of this. In September, The Economic Times reported that about 100 customers of FreeCharge, a mobile wallet provider, lost money due to a phishing attack.",2016-11-14,9rs3VGFypR0tBWsa6J1ojJ,"As of 30 September, the number of point of sale devices, which accepted debit and credit cards as modes of payments at merchant outlets, was only 1.49 million",00:31,Cashless future is a long way off despite big surge in e-payments
432,0.212625,"As the nation begins cleaning its cash hoard, its banks are still struggling with the hygiene of their loan books. State Bank of India (SBI), the countrys largest lender, was no different. 
				   
				Against hopes of a better asset quality, the lender saw its fresh slippages increase again, the stock of gross non-performing assets (NPAs) double from a year ago and its net profit drop by 34% in the September quarter.Slippages during the quarter were Rs10,341 crore and the tally of slippages for the first six months of this fiscal year is at Rs19,131 crore.Its gross NPA stock got the distinction of crossing the Rs1 trillion-mark in the June quarter and it inched up a little more in the September quarter as well.To be fair, investors should have seen this coming especially after the disappointing results of other corporate lenders such as ICICI Bank Ltd and Axis Bank Ltd. Perhaps there was a thread of doubt that had investors playing safe as the SBI stock has hardly moved over the last two months. But the stock was rightly punished on Friday, with the disappointing results driving down its shares by over 3% to Rs272.90 apiece.But there is more bad news. Out of SBIs Rs19,131 crore loans that slipped during the six months ended September, 40% was from its declared watch list. The management had put out a corporate loan watch list of Rs34,776 crore in March and at that time, analysts were comforted by the quantum given the lenders huge loan book size. But 60% of SBIs slippages have come from outside its watch list. While the list is now down to Rs25,951 crore, it is not sufficient to look at it excluding the larger book. A quarter of the watch list has already slipped, much of it stemming from the weak sectors like construction, roads, and iron and steel. Asset quality of its mid-corporate segment and small and medium enterprises hasnt stabilized for over a year now.Given that SBI would soon be a bigger behemoth after the merger of its associates, a look at the consolidated balance sheet is a must. The picture gets worse as the bad loan ratios of its associates are massive and their combined gross NPA ratio was 13.77% for the quarter and that of SBI was 7.41%. All of its five associates were loss-making for the six months ended September. By the very nature of its vast franchise and size, SBI would command a premium to its other peers. Further, the management has given a positive outlook on asset quality in the quarters ahead. The lender is betting on the recent leeway allowed by the Reserve Bank of India that effectively reduces the need for provisioning towards stressed assets. With leveraged corporate groups in the throes of selling off their assets to pay back the lenders, SBI is hoping that resolution would be fast. For the stock to trade at a price-to-book value multiple of 1.04 its projected fiscal year 2017 earnings, this hope is the saving grace.",2016-11-14,y3gvFPBepeBhUETL7pwGwO,"Out of State Bank of Indias Rs19,131 crore loans that slipped during the six months ended September, 40% was from its declared watch list",05:19,Swachh SBI?

What is it? The approximate number of companies that had contended the right of states to impose entry tax (levy on movement of goods from one state to another).Why is it important? The Supreme Court on Friday ruled against these companies and upheld states rights to levy entry tax and said that this did not violate the principles of free trade. According to estimates, companies would have to reportedly pay Rs30,000-Rs35,000 crore in entry tax to states. The government is trying to roll out the goods and services tax, which is to subsume all indirect taxes (including the entry tax) in the country, by 1 April 2017 but this could be delayed by another six months.Tell me more: Companies including the Jindal Group, Vedanta, Tata Steel and Steel Authority of India had argued that the imposition of the entry tax by states on the movement of goods into their respective territories was against the right to freedom of trade and commerce in India, which is guaranteed under Article 301 of the Constitution.Rs2,500What is it? The cash withdrawal limit at ATMs per day, up from Rs2,000, as per a government notification.Why is it important? One of the consequences of the shock announcement of withdrawal of old currency notes in Rs500 and Rs1,000 denominations by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday has been the long queues outside bank branches and ATMs. The governments apparent lack of preparedness at dealing with the moves aftermath has been criticised and there have been instances of daily wage labourers losing out on their livelihoods, low-income workers struggling to get their hands on cash due to not having bank accounts or means/awareness to transact digitally.Tell me more: After a review by the finance ministry, the limit of old notes of Rs500 and Rs1,000 that can be exchanged with new notes of Rs2,000 and Rs500 have been increased from Rs4,000 to Rs4,500 per day. The weekly limit of withdrawal from bank accounts has been hiked to Rs24,000 from Rs20,000 and the limit of Rs10,000 has been removed.6What is it? The number of years of negotiations to arrive at a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement between India and Japan signed during Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit to Japan.Why is it important? This will help India buy nuclear technology from Japan and for Japan, it is its first civilian nuclear pact cooperation with a country (India) that has not signed the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. However, this exception has been made by Japan reportedly due to a separate note that says that it would suspend nuclear cooperation with India if it conducts a nuclear test, though unnamed Indian officials have insisted that this is not legally binding but only included keeping in mind Japanese sensitivities. This has raised apprehensions that this may lead to re-negotiations with other countries with whom India has signed nuclear pacts to insert similar clauses.Tell me more: Another clause in the note reportedly says that if Japan scraps the deal in the event of India conducting a nuclear test, the latter cannot ask for compensation for disruption of electricity from a nuclear plant or for the resultant economic losses. Japan is the only country to have suffered the impact of nuclear weapons being dropped on it and, therefore, has been uncomfortable signing such a pact with India, which is outside the nuclear non-proliferation regime.0.2%What is it? The expected increase in global carbon emissions above the 2015 levels from fossil fuels and industry in 2016, according to a study.Why is it important? This is the third straight year with an almost flat growth rate and a significant decline from the 3% recorded in the 2000s. One of the main reasons for this could be attributed to a decline in emissions by China and the US, the two largest emitters. Emissions by China and the US are expected to decrease by 0.5% (from 0.7% in 2015) and 17% (2.5% in 2015) this year, respectively. However, researchers said it is too early to say whether this is a temporary blip or the making of a long-term trend.Tell me more: Indias emissions, which were growing by 6% per annum over the last decade, slowed down to 5% in 2015 and such levels are expected to continue as it expects to double its coal production by 2020.$40.85 billionWhat is it? Asset sales by Indian companies pending or completed in 2016.Why is it important? This is the highest-ever asset sales by companies since liberalisation in 1991 and around 46% higher than the previous high of $27.96 billion recorded in 2007. This could be one of the main reasons why private investment has been muted in the recent past. While the 2007 asset sales were due to investors wanting a bigger pie of Indias growth story (its economy grew by 9% or more between 2005-06 and 2007-08), 2016 asset sales are due to the high debt levels of corporates.Tell me more: Some of the deals in 2016 include sale of controlling stake in Essar Oil to Russias Rosneft and its partners for nearly $13 billion and sale of Jaypee Groups cement assets to Aditya Birla-controlled UltraTech Cement for around $2.4 billion.howindialives.com is a search engine for public data",2016-11-14,uhljG1EgkoKTaCSia10yCP,"In other news, $40.85 billion is the highest-ever asset sales by companies since liberalisation in 1991",11:30,"News in Numbers | New withdrawal limit from ATMs is Rs2,500 per day "

376,0.24995,"Mumbai: Dell Technologies chairman and chief executive officer Michael Dell is determined to change the common perception of his companythat its a traditional maker of low-margin products like personal computers, servers and storage systems.
				   
				The view changed little even after Dell said in October 2015 that it will buy EMC Corp. Now that the merger of the two companies is complete, Dells strategy to alter this view is revolving around quickly rolling out new infrastructure products that have been jointly developed by Dell and EMC teams, cross-selling them to clients of both, strengthening existing partnerships with firms like SAP AG, Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp., and forging new ones even with competitors like Amazon Web Services Inc.Dell executives say they are best suited to help clients go digital with the combined entitys broad technology portfolio, which not only comprises computing products but also services and solutions in the areas of hybrid cloud, software-defined data centres and converged- and hyper-converged infrastructure (integration managed by software), platform-as-a-service, data analytics, mobility and cybersecurity.This multipronged strategy was evident when Dell took the stage at the first-ever Dell-EMC World 2016 event in Austin, Texas, on 18 October, and gave an impassioned speech that had all the trappings of a successful road map for next-gen computing.Beginning with a reiteration of the Go Big or Go Home, Baby! slogan delivered at last years Dell event, he peppered this years speech with technology buzzwords like digital, the Internet of things (IoT), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI).Alluding to Dells Digital Transformation Index , Dell underscored the presence of a digital fear among the 4,000 business leaders across 16 countries and 12 industries that were surveyed as part of a recent report. His pitch: This (digital) future is coming very rapidly and the future does not care whether you are ready. But we do... (We are) the trusted provider of essential infrastructure for the next industrial revolution.Dell evidently believes in economies of scale, made evident by his Go Big slogan. The Dell-EMC merger, announced last October, was the largest deal in tech history, topping Avago Technologies Ltds $37 billion purchase of Broadcom Corp.Dell Technologies is now a $74 billion company that comprises a PC business and affiliated businesses including virtualization (the partitioning of a physical server into smaller virtual servers in a bid to reduce costs) company VMware Inc., security firms RSA Security Llc and SecureWorks Inc., software and services (including cloud and Big Data analytics) company Pivotal Software Inc., and cloud management software firm Virtustream Inc. Dells eponymous combined business now comprises two segmentsDell EMC is the sub-brand for the companys enterprise business, including products and solutions, and Dell is the sub-brand for the companys client solutions for consumers, business and institutional customers.Dell plans to go about the task of ramping up business growth also by touting that the combined company stands as a market leader in many of the most important and high-growth areas of the information technology (IT) market, including positions as the Leader in 20 Gartner Magic Quadrants and a portfolio of more than 20,000 patents and applications.Does the pecking order bear out Dells claim?To be sure, the worldwide IT spending figure augurs well for technology companies like Dell Technologies, which figures in the top three in PCs, servers and storage.Overall IT spending is forecast to reach $3.5 trillion in 2017, up 2.9% from estimated spending of $3.4 trillion this year, according to Gartner Inc. According to the research firm, software and IT services segments have been the bright spots. Software spending is projected to grow 6% in 2016 and another 7.2% in 2017 to total $357 billion, while IT services spending is forecast to grow 3.9% in 2016 to $900 billion and 4.8% in 2017 to $943 billion.ALSO READ | Dell Technologiess road map for IndiaThe total worldwide enterprise storage systems factory revenue remained flat year-on-year at $8.8 billion during the second quarter of 2016, according to research firm International Data Corporations (IDCs) Worldwide Quarterly Enterprise Storage Systems Tracker. EMC and HPE (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) accounted for 18.1% and 17.6% of spending, respectively, of the enterprise storage market (IDC declares a statistical tie when there is less than 1% difference in the revenue share of two or more vendors.). Dell held the next position with 11.5% share of revenue during the quarter. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and NetApp Inc. accounted for 6.8% and 6.7% of global spending, respectively.Sales of server-based storage were up 9.8% during the quarter and accounted for almost $2.4 billion in revenue. External storage systems remained the largest market segment, but the $5.7 billion in sales represented flat year-on-year growth. However, according to Liz Conner, research manager of storage systems at IDC, spending on all flash-based storage deployments continues to grow and help drive the market, following the decreasing cost of flash media, deployments and availability of flash-based storage products (a sharp focus area for the combined entity, Dell Technologies).ALSO READ |In firms, PCs and smartphones coexist in a multi-device world: Michael DellIn the same period, worldwide server revenue declined 0.8% year-on-year, while shipments grew 2% from the second quarter of 2015, according to Gartner. Dell moved into the top spot in shipments, while HPE remained the worldwide leader in server revenue.Dell garnered 19.3% of the market and moved into the No. 1 position in worldwide server shipments due primarily to growth resulting from programmes it has in place in the Asia-Pacific region, most notably in China. HPE continued to lead the x86 server (Intel-based server) market in revenue with 26% of the market. IBM secured the third position with 9.1% of the market, but experienced the largest decline among the top five vendors, according to the Gartner report.Contrarian betsNotwithstanding the scepticism over the merger, there is certainly some merit in Dells claim over the economies of scale that this merger can achieve even as there remain formidable challenges that continue to keep some analysts and clients sceptical. The challenges include concerns over the sum paid for the acquisition, integration challenges, some overlap in products and technologies between Dell and EMC, leadership issues in the combined entity, and partnership conflicts since some Dell partners compete with EMC and VMware.Michael has an opportunity to redefine computing if he reinvests on innovation and can pare back the debt, said R Ray Wang, principal analyst, founder and chairman of Silicon Valley-based Constellation Research Inc. He, however, pointed out that customers and partners remain sceptical, wondering if this is an exercise to sell off the parts of the acquisition to pay down debt and save Dell, or a strategic play to own the cloud and the future of the data centre.Shedding the enterprise software assets leads us to believe that this may not be an innovation play yet but a move to sell off assets to save Dell. The experience at HP Enterprise is what customers are scared of. They dont want to see their favourite vendors exit the market where massive investments have been made. The challenge is having two legacy players come together for innovation. The math in the accounting makes it hard to believe what innovations will come about. Dell did attempt to address this road map at Dell World but most of our clients remain sceptical, said Wang.Dell is also a contrarian when it comes to defying certain technology trends. For instance, Dell became a private company on 5 February 2013, in a deal led by Silver Lake that was valued at $24.9 billionthe biggest leveraged buyout since the financial crisiseven as other tech firms seek stock market listings. Second, he believes in mergers and acquisitions even as competing companies like Hewlett Packard have split their businesses. Third, while the world is betting on smartphones, his company no longer makes them.I dont think the world needs another smartphone company, says Dell. A smartphone is just another node, explains Dell, adding that all the information you get on a smartphone comes from a data centre. And what you upload, goes back to the data centre.This, for Dell, is a business opportunity since his company provides servers that are used by data centres.Wang agrees that the smartphone market is a bad one to be in and is not worth it when you dont own the OS (operating system).However, the fact is that even as Dell remains optimistic over the future of the PC (desktops and laptops), worldwide PC shipments totalled 68.9 million units in the third quarter of 2016, a 5.7% decline from the third quarter of 2015, according to the preliminary findings of Gartner. This was the eighth consecutive quarter of decline in PC shipmentsthe longest streak in the history of the PC industry.Lenovo Corp. continued to be the worldwide market leader based on preliminary PC shipments, but HP Inc. is nearly tied for this top spot. Segment-wise, Dell claims his company is No. 1 in PCs in terms of revenue but Dell ranked third in terms of shipments with a share of 13.5% in the third quarter of 2016. (All these rankings could change when final shipment results are published by Gartner.) Dell is insistent that revenue is more important than shipments.Banking on innovationWe have been growing (the PC business) for 15 quarters. We want to be profitable so that we can reinvest in innovation, he says. Part of his companys innovation is around the PC computing system, as Jeff Clarke, vice- chairman of operations and president of client solutions, puts it. There is much innovation in the PC computing system... like the computer becoming personal and new experiences with AR/VR that provide users with new ways to interact, explains Clarke. In a 7 September blog, Clarke also points out that beyond the device, workforce transformation requires a cloud-based infrastructure to support peoples new behaviors, new devices and new expectations, which EMC can provide. He also underscored the importance of Airwatch (now a Dell company) as an EMM (enterprise mobility management) solution for managing phones and tablets.And with cloud client-computing VDI (virtual desktop infrastructure solutions) from VMWare, we are the only true end-to-end VDI provider in the industry, from planning to deployment, data center to the endpoint, on- and off-premise. Bottom line: Combining EMCs cloud capabilities with our award-winning PCs, we have just created a very powerful solution, wrote Clarke.For instance, the Dell-EMC product collaboration has resulted in products like VxRaila hyper-converged infrastructure solution from VMware that includes fifth generation Intel Xeon processors and Dells PowerEdge servers. As opposed to a converged infrastructure model (also known as hardware-defined) where the server, networking and storage can be separated if needed, in a hyper-converged infrastructure (referred to as software-defined) the components are integrated and hence cannot be split.The other part of innovation revolves around Dells belief that IoT is fundamentally changing businesses. Explaining his rationale for why we created Dell Technologies, Dell says the planet is becoming more intelligent and more connected by the minute, and ultimately will become intertwined with a vast Internet of Things, paving the way for our customers to do incredible things.Dell elaborated in his speech that as the cost of making something intelligent approaches zero dollars, intelligence is being embedded into every aspect of our physical world. We have about 8 billion connected devices on the planet, and 15 years from now there will be 200 billion or more, and all these sensors and nodes in those devices will provide access to a host of new digital applications, creating massive new sources of information. Using this information to provide better insights and build a better world may be the biggest opportunity in history, he said.Using the premise that everything improves about 10x every five years, Dell in his speech also envisioned a future with smart cities, driverless cars and nanobots that cure cancer and repair cell damage. He added that overnight shipping will seem like snail mail compared to the instant gratification of drone delivery... AR and VR will redefine work, learning and play... machine learning, deep learning, AI and unsupervised learning to all this data will unleash a torrent of innovation and progress and solve some of the worlds greatest challenges.Towards this end, Dell and EMC have made a cumulative research and development (R&D) investment of $12.7 billion over the past three years and plan to invest $4.5 billion in R&D this year, which is multiple times what the competition is investing, Dell said.Dell, for instance, has invested in six worldwide global command centres where technicians constantly monitor events like flight delays, traffic jams, weather conditions, earthquakes or even unsettling events like riots that might impact the companys ability to handle a support call. The technicians track live tweets, live broadcasts of news and weather, and map the location using geographical information systems and Google Earthall in a single window using a customized interface. India (Bengaluru) does not have a global command centre but has a social media listening command centre.In June, Dells Extreme Scale Infrastructure group unveiled Tritona liquid cooling technology that scores over traditional air-cooled solutions for data centres. It designed this water-based system to cool server chips (developed with Intel Corp.) in eBay.coms data centres.In an 18 October note, Mike Krell, lead IoT analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, agreed that Dell Technologies was uniquely positioned to help customers solve their IoT puzzle. Dell, Krell wrote, combines experience and credibility with specific vertical market enterprises, a curated partner ecosystem with deep vertical knowledge, the industrys broadest offering of IoT-focused infrastructure, and an ability to provide a world-class customer experience to help customers solve specific IoT problemstoday.But will Go Big work for Dell?Dells growth strategy also revolves around acquisitions, which Dell says will continue. Ever since Michael Dell returned to the company as its chief executive in 2007, the company has spent as much as $15 billion on more than 30 acquisitions prior to the $67 billion EMC purchase. These included EqualLogic ($1.4 billion; storage area networks, where EMC dominates), Perot Systems ($3.9 billion; IT services), SecureWorks ($612 million; security services, where EMCs RSA division has a big presence), Force10 ($700 million; data centre Ethernet switches) and Quest Software ($2.4 billion; system management and security software), among others.However, not all of those acquisitions have done well for Dell, including some with a significant presence in the Indian market (security provider SonicWALL, for instance). According to a 20 June report on TechCrunch, while Dell had reportedly paid $3.6 billion for Quest Software and SonicWALL, it was only able to recoup around $2 billion for the duo when it sold them to private equity firm Francisco Partners and hedge fund Elliott Management. Dell also had to sell Perot Systems to Japans NTT Data Corp.  for $3.1 billion in March.Nevertheless, analysts like Ashish Nadkarni, program director for IDCs worldwide infrastructure practice, believe that having a bigger, more full-service portfolio allows the combined company (Dell Technologies) to address a wide range of use cases in a very holistic fashion. In a 16 April note, he pointed out that these solutions could be diverse and even emerging, like IoT and real-time analytics. Dell and EMC can likewise take advantage of synergies when it comes to joint go-to-market efforts around compute, storage, and networking solutions,  wrote Nadkarni.He also believes that since Dell Technologies is a privately-held company, it will be able to offer the flexibility of interesting product road maps and solutions as well as additional purchasing options, like subscription-based offerings, free from the 90-day shot clock pressures typically exerted on public companies.On his part, Dell is clear that his company needs to savour customer relationships. He concludes: There are many customers who do not want to change, and we dont want to change them. There are plenty of opportunities for cross-selling. When we looked at the top 5,000 Dell customers and the top 5,000 EMC customers, we found only 1,000 common ones. So there are enormous opportunities to cross-sell among the portfolio. Customers are excited about that toothey actually like the fact that we are bringing everything together with these engineered and integrated solutions. Thats what we are focused on.",2016-11-15,qV03Hr8aiVWnLwqzhDJqpM,Dell is leveraging its EMC acquisition to offer services and solutions for companies to cope with the fast-transforming digital landscape,04:42,Will Dell make it big with EMC?
128,-0.225725,"New Delhi: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) on Friday served a notice to the government, demanding arbitration after the ministry of petroleum and natural gas asked it to pay $1.55 billion for allegedly producing gas from a reservoir in the Krishna Godavari basin geologically connected to that of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC), said a person aware of the development. 
				   
				The move is set to secure more time for RIL to resolve the dispute and help it avoid any immediate financial impact. The ministry raised the demand on 4 November, giving RIL one month to pay up, after the justice A.P. Shah panel told the ministry on 31 August that RIL should make up for the unfair enrichment it had obtained by way of retaining the gains of gas that seeped into its field from that of ONGC. The one-member panel, which looked into ONGCs complaints of gas flow between the two companies blocks, had also said that it is the government, not the state-run firm, which is eligible for compensation from RIL.The Mukesh Ambani-promoted firm has questioned the way the government interpreted the production lease for its KG-DWN-98/3 (KG D6) block and alleged that the manner of claiming compensation neither conformed to law nor to global practices, the person cited earlier said, on condition of anonymity. RIL, as the operator of the KG D6 block, has sought arbitration on behalf of the consortium comprising Canadas Niko Resources Ltd and BP Exploration (Alpha) Ltd, the person said. Emails sent to the three companies remained unanswered at the time of going to press. A government official privy to the developments, however, said there was no way of resolving the dispute other than RIL paying for the gas that did not belong to its field. With both sides hardening their positions, the dispute is set to slip into a protracted legal battle. According to a report by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, a US-based consultancy selected by both ONGC and RIL which was relied upon by the Shah panel for confirmation of the gas flow between the blocks, about 11 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas migrated to KG D6 from adjacent fields between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2015,  of which 8.9 bcm was tapped by RIL. The government official cited above said the ministry has not applied any discretion in arriving at the compensation figure.The government merely multiplied the amount of gas found by independent consultants to have flowed between the fields with the applicable gas price, the official said. Prolonged disputes are not in the interest of the industrys development.

3,0.235325,"Mumbai: Private sector lender Axis Bank Ltd is looking to sell its approximately 8% stake in Mswipe Technologies Pvt. Ltd, a mobile payments services provider, two people aware of the development said. 
				   
				The bank wants to sell its entire stake in the payments terminal company Mswipe and they have initiated discussions on the same. They are talking to some of the existing investors of the company, too, to pick the stake from them, said one of the two people cited above, requesting anonymity, as the talks are private.According to the second person cited above, the bank is looking to sell its stake at a price that would value Mswipe at $200-250 million.Around the last time they raised funds, the company was valued at close to $150 million. The price which they are seeking could get them up to $20 million for their stake, he said.The last fund-raising at Mswipe was in July 2015, when the company raised Rs160 crore in a Series C round from new investors such as Falcon Edge Capital, Ola Cabs and Meru Capital.Existing investors Matrix Partners India, Axis Bank Ltd and DSG Consumer Partners also participated in the funding round.Axis Bank first invested in the company in early 2013.Emails sent to Axis Bank and Mswipe on Friday went unanswered.Mswipe was founded in 2012 by Manish Patel, a doctor by education, who previously co-founded an alcoholic beverages distribution company called Milestone Merchandise. Mswipe provides a mobile payment solution with a card reader, which can be attached to any mobile phones audio (headset) jack. The company also provides similar card payment solutions for smartphones.It works closely with smaller banks such as Corporation Bank, RBL Bank Ltd, Shamrao Vithal Co-op. Bank and large banks such as Axis Bank.It is also present in the Middle East, the US and South-East Asia through partnerships. Its clients include small and medium enterprises.In the payments services market, Mswipe competes with companies such as Ezetap and Paynear.In August 2015, Ezetap raised Rs150 crore from Social+Capital, Helion Advisors and Berggruen Holdings, Horizons Ventures and the Capricorn Investment Group.In December 2015, Paynear raised around Rs16 crore from a high net-worth individual investor.According to a March 2015 report by Ken Research, the payment services industry grew at a compound annual growth rate of 147.6% between the financial years 2012 and 2014.The research firm believes that the Indian payments market will continue to grow at a strong rate going ahead. The payments market is driven largely by transactions through mobile point of sale terminals and mobile banking, the report said.For Axis Bank, plans to sell its stake in Mswipe come at a time when the bank is facing stress due to loans that soured.In the quarter to September, the private sector bank reported a 83% plunge in net profit at Rs319 crore, primarily on account of higher provisioning for bad loans.The bank had posted a net profit of Rs1,915.64 crore in the same period in 2015-16.Gross non-performing assets (NPA) and net NPAs at the bank rose to 4.17% and 2.02%, respectively in the quarter.",2016-11-15,0SArJpfqkiCBj82GYYIncL,Axis Bank may sell its 8% stake in mobile payments firm Mswipe for around $20 million in a deal that is likely to value that firm at $200-250 million,00:47,Axis Bank in talks to sell Mswipe stake
55,0.24105,"Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) reported another set of sub-par results, with revenues and operating profit for the quarter ended 30 September declining by more than 4% sequentially in its India operations. The company doesnt report results for its wireless business separately anymore, and the India business is therefore the best proxy for it. 
				   
				Earlier, Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd had reported sequential revenue declines of around 2%, largely due to the seasonality factor. RCom said in a press statement that results for the quarter were impacted by an increase in competitive intensity, migration of CDMA customers to 4G LTE and seasonality factors. Its understandable that the migration attempt will result in some disruption. Average revenue per user rose 5% sequentially, suggesting a larger proportion of low-value customers have been lost. But overall, given the continued sluggishness, theres hardly anything for investors to get excited about. RCom shares have more than halved in the current year, and initial enthusiasm about the companys strategic deals with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd as well as its deleveraging plans has waned.All of the debt-reduction plans the company has talked about are still a work-in-progress and some of them are at fairly preliminary stages. And while the merger of its wireless business with Aircel Ltd may come through, the success of the deal depends largely on how successful the two are in raising a large amount of equity capital in the combined entity. And the current environment, where telecom stocks have fallen at a fast pace, is hardly conducive for raising equity. There is also lack of clarity about RComs arrangements with Reliance Jio for use of the latters 4G network, and how beneficial the deal will be. A look at how the companys shares have moved this year suggests investors are not very hopeful about RComs prospects.Reliance Group companies have sued HT Media Ltd, Mints publisher, and nine others in the Bombay high court over a 2 October 2014 front-page story that they have disputed.

208,0.23075,"New Delhi: Reliance Jio had a jump-start with cheap data and free calls, and there are others who have shared in the spoils.
				   
				The launch of high-speed telecom services by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in September prompted Swedish telecom equipment and network services provider Ericsson AB to fast-track the roll-out of its 4G network.Jios launch definitely accelerated the development of high bit-rate mobile broadband. Without Jio, we wouldnt have seen such a quick roll-out of 4G. It would have happened a little bit more slowly, said Paolo Colella, head for the India region at Ericsson.We have already seen the 4G wave happening in many of the Western countries. In the Far East, China, Korea (and) Japan have already invested heavily in building up infrastructure. Jio has contributed to the acceleration and aligning of India to the rest of the big economies, Colella added.The limited spread of wireline fixed infrastructure in India has led to limited usage of broadband. As the country moves to 4G, there is expected to be massive demand for smartphones.We are anticipating by 2020 we will have at least 800 million smartphones in the market, so the Internet, for Indian people, is mobile. That is a major difference, Colella said.(The other difference is) the industry was not predicting to have Android phones at $40 per unit at the end of 2016, probably expecting it to happen in at least 12 months, if not 18 months further, he added.True Software Scandinavia AB, which makes the Truecaller mobile app to identify incoming calls through a crowd-sourced database, is another Swedish company that has gained from the Jio launch.The number of Truecaller users on the Jio network is already three times that of any other carrier, its co-founder Alan Mamedi said.We see that Reliance Jio right now is three times bigger than other carriers for us, as new users are joining every day. It is not that users from other carriers are droppingthey actually continue to grow. So, the trend we are seeing is that more people get connected for the first time because it is affordable, which is very interesting, Mamedi said.Mamedi added that Reliance Jio will remain a game-changer even after the expiry of free services offer since the tariffs are 10 times cheaper than the competitor.Truecaller, which entered India in 2009, struggled in the initial years as the data market had not developed, and found its feet only after the widespread adoption of 3G and 4G services.Mamedi said as more people use 4G services, it will give tools to smart people to create something magical, driving more start-ups.Home-grown mobile handset manufacturer Lava Mobiles is another company that has gained from the Jio launch. The company hopes widespread 4G adoption will help double its market share to 20% by 2020.In the operator sector, they are doing disruption, but this disruption will increase the operator business also, pushing it to double. Each company is going to gain, Lava Mobiles chairman and managing director Hari Om Rai said.Lava Mobiles is currently investing at least Rs2,600 crore for capacity expansion to produce 18 million devices every month by 2021.4G phones have witnessed a very a high demand in last six weeks. For our industry, it is very valuable. There will be disruption and explosion in the industry.

88,0.246725,"Vodafone Group Plc said it was hit by an impairment charge of 6.38 billion ($6.86 billion) with respect to its investment in India. After accounting for a deferred tax asset, the net impairment charge was lower at 5 billion. A little over six years ago, it had written down goodwill and other intangible assets by £2.3 billion ($3.33 billion).
				   
				On both occasions, the company cited an increase in competitive pressure, leading to a reassessment of profit growth projections, which led to large write-downs in the carrying value of Vodafones India assets. Its worthwhile noting here that Vodafone had paid a hefty premium while acquiring the India operations in 2007, and it isnt surprising that the bloated value of intangible assets have to be periodically written down.Even so, Vodafones impairment charge this time around looks fairly high, at more than double the previous one. Note that so far this year, market capitalizations of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd have fallen by around $2 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, reflecting the large value erosion in the sector. As such, the large write-down only underscores the troubles the sector is facing. Six years ago, when the previous impairment charge was taken by Vodafone, it had assumed Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) growth of 17.5% on an average in the five years till March 2015. Interestingly, organic profit growth ranged 15-20% during this period, although it fell sharply to 4.1% in fiscal year 2015-16. With the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, sluggish growth rates are expected to continue. The growth assumptions for the current impairment testing assume Ebitda growth of 7.8% on an average in the next five years. A new entrant has recently launched free trial services for an extended time period and commercial price plans that were at a significant discount to prevailing market pricing, resulting in competitive responses from other operators. This has created a high degree of uncertainty over a range of commercial planning assumptions including future pricing, profitability and market structure, the company said in a statement. This is perhaps the first official acknowledgment that Reliance Jios launch has been hugely value destructive. Strangely enough, despite the diminishing returns from the sector, large companies are increasing capital expenditure to retain market share. As a result, return ratios are falling from already low levels. The only silver lining, from an investors perspective, is that share prices of Indian telcos have already fallen sharply in recent months, and seem to be pricing in a fairly bad future.",2016-11-16,Bd3qtEbVPw0PwNRCxQwYxH,"At 6.38 billion, Vodafones impairment charge this time around looks fairly high, at more than double the previous one",07:51,"Vodafone sees sluggish growth, thanks to Reliance Jio"
54,-0.144175,"Chennai-based cement maker India Cements Ltds net profit surged 62.1% to Rs62.41 crore year-on-year (y-o-y) in the September quarter, aided by lower finance cost and tax expenditures. Net sales improved 6.7% y-o-y to Rs1,307 crore. Both net profit and net sales exceeded Bloomberg estimates of Rs58.09 crore and Rs1,145.60 crore, respectively. 
				   
				Volumes grew more than 10% y-o-y, but realizations slipped. Also, the quarters Ebitda at Rs2,244 crore was marginally below estimates of some analysts. This miss was primarily due to increase in minimum wages, which resulted in a sequential rise in employee cost/tonne. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.While the stock has lost 2.2% after the September quarter earnings were announced, i.e. in the last three trading sessions, the anticipated short-term negative impact of currency ban has led to correction of 26.4% since 9 November.In a post-earnings conference call, the management said demonetization of Rs500/1,000 notes has not affected sales volume till date and the proportion of cash in cement purchase is only 10-15%. But some brokerage firms have raised a red flag by trimming their Ebitda estimates. Our channel checks indicate pressure on demand in most parts of the country. We expect dispatches to get impacted going ahead. We revise our Ebitda estimates downwards by 3.3%/13.8% for FY17E/FY18E to factor in lower demand in H2FY17 due to the demonetization issue, Emkay Research said in a report. Sharing a similar view, Reliance Securities Ltd too has cut Ebitda estimates by 6% and 15% for FY17E and FY18E, respectively. Meanwhile, in the first half of this fiscal year, India Cements has repaid Rs80 crore debt and aims at debt repayment of Rs170 crore in the second half.

103,-0.2376,"Public sector banks have been blamed for the unprecedented pile-up of bad loans since the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) ordered a clean-up of books last year. Indeed, the quarterly results that followed the clean-up showed government banks held the most toxic assets. Their private-sector counterparts were hailed for their high asset quality.
				   
				But the September quarter results show private-sector lenders, at least some of them, are as deep in troubled waters as their public sector peers. At the aggregate level, private-sector banks saw bad loan stock double on a gross basis to Rs66,314 crore and provisions treble to Rs1.2 trillion from a year ago. For the public sector group, the surge in bad loan stock was similar, but provisions rose only 49%. This could mean private-sector lenders were slow in recognizing distressed assets and making provisions. The casualties were Axis Bank Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd, Yes Bank Ltd and South Indian Bank.Axis Bank saw a significant portion of loans on its watchlist turn bad, provisions climbed fivefold and the provision coverage ratio dropped to 60% from 72% in the March quarter. At ICICI Bank, gross bad loans doubled and it had to provide Rs7,082.69 crore for them. Yes Bank and South Indian Bank also posted weak asset quality metrics.But the real worry is these private-sector lenders net non-performing assets (NPA). The accretion in net NPAs for these lenders was far higher than that of gross NPAs. This means upgrades and recoveries are slowing even as fresh slippages are showing no signs of abatement. On an aggregate basis, private-sector banks net NPA stock jumped 132% while that of the public sector banks surged a shade lower by 103%.Private banks have always been perceived to be more efficient and having a firm hand on errant borrowers. But the net NPA accretion shows they are no better than their public sector counterparts.Granted, public sector lenders are still the worst lot but it is time that private-sector banks, especially corporate lenders, are valued more realistically.

163,0.248,"Bengaluru: Back in 2008, 25-year-old Rohan Murty embarked on an unusual road trip. He travelled to various US cities around the Washington, DC metro area on his own, often walking for miles from one city to another. It was far from a thrill-seeking adventurehe was a man on a mission. Murty drove more than a thousand miles through forests and in the middle of nowhere.
				   
				Using a technology system he had built at Harvard Universitywhere he was at the time pursuing his PhD in computer scienceMurty was attempting to measure the actual usage of licensed and unlicensed spectrumwhich is typically used by telecom companies, TV and radio stations, as well as for technology such as Wi-Fi. He stopped every few miles, in order to validate the correctness of his research and the software he had built. What he found out during that study would lay the basis for his research into technology that is referred to as White Space Network or White-Fi. In laymans terms, White-Fi refers to unutilized television broadcast frequencies or white spaces that are potentially capable of delivering low-cost Internet connectivity to rural and remote parts of a country. What I found out during that trip was that spectrum in general is severely underutilized, says Murty. Murty jokingly recalls that at one point, he was even stopped by a state police officer, who wondered why some scrawny, brown kid was walking around suspiciously with an unusual technical device on a US highway. A vocal proponent of White-Fiwhich he believes has the potential to deliver affordable Internet connectivity to hundreds of millions of Indians across the remotest parts of the countryMurty is of the view that the Indian government needs to make a stronger push for White-Fi and does not agree with the current stand of top telcos such as Airtel and Vodafone, which have so far opposed the use of white spaces. Companies like Microsoft have also in recent months urged the government to fight for White-Fi and oppose the telecom lobby, citing the examples of countries like the US and UK where unlicensed spectrum usage has been permitted. In an interview, Murty, son of Infosys Ltd founder N.R. Narayana Murthy and a junior fellow at the Society of Fellows at Harvard University, spoke primarily on his research on White-Fi, how his work focused on architecture for dynamic spectrum access in wireless networks and other work that he is doing on the sidelines. Aside from helping manage investments for the Murthy family office, Catamaran Ventures, he has also made some angel investments under the radarincluding a small investment in Bengaluru-based start-up Floh, which is a singles network that helps urban and educated singles find life partners. Edited excerpts:What do you make of current debates around spectrum usage in India? The telcos have so far fiercely opposed the use of white spaces and unlicensed spectrum...Let me zoom back a little. Historically weve always thought of spectrum as a binary sort of thingeither somebody has exclusive access to it or nobody has exclusive access to it. So, its either licensed or unlicensed. Example of licensed, is TV, radio, cellphone companies, etc. Wi-Fi is an example of unlicensed spectrum, its the technology that Wi-Fi operates overthats one example. Wi-Fi is just a piece of technology though, not a piece of spectrum. Now, lets take an examplelets say you have a wire between your computer and the Internet. And you pump data through. Think of the wire as a pipe and data as water. The more volume of water you pump, the more data you are pumping through. But there is a limit before the pipe explodes, in some sense. So, what do you do when the pipe saturates? All you have to do is instal one more pipeor in this case, one more wire. So, in some sense you can have infinite bandwidthbecause you just keep installing more wires. And that works. But when you move to the wireless world, this is not the right analogy. The wireless world is like a highwaythe width is fixed, you cant increase the width at all. That is a limitation of nature. So, the capacity of a wireless world is boundthere is a maximum you can extract out of it. So, now you have these lanes on the highwaywhen you licence some part of the spectrum to someone, you basically say hey, this lane is yours. Nobody else can touch it. And then there is another lane which is for the public and they use Wi-Fi for it. Now, what happens is that more and more cars are getting into this lane and there is only one lane. And we start saturating this lane. What do we do? We look across at the licensed lane, which is registered to someone and we see that nobody is using it frequently and its just sitting there. But the law states that you can only use this one lane. And all this while more and more cars are coming and we feel there is scarcity. But the truth is that this is artificial scarcity. So, the work I ended up doing was to see if those unused lanes could be used without interfering with someone elses licensed lane and on how to detect the presence of others in that lane. When I detect youre coming, then I just get out and go back in the other lane. India seems to be lagging countries such as the US and the UK in terms of embracing the opportunity hereAbsolutely. India is behind in terms of thinking of new forms of spectrum usage. I do believe that is the case. If you go talk to the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) in the US and Ofcom in the UK, just look at some of the progressive things these guys are doing. In India, weve seen companies like Google and Facebook attempt moon shots with permission from the government and provide Internet access through balloon projects such as Loon to remote parts of the country. But weve surprisingly seen opposition on White-Fi. What does the government and the telecom lobby need to do on this matter? Is there a general lack of understanding of how this technology can benefit the masses? There is no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem. I dont think the answer is that telcos will solve everything. If they claim that, I dont agree with that. I dont think balloons will solve everything either. All these different technologies will play a role and theyll fit different needs. I think it will fulfil an important need. You cannot solve everything (with just White-Fi) as well. Lets assume that spectrum operated by Wi-Fi was operated by a telcoalmost certainly it wouldnt have taken off. Every time you would have turned your Wi-Fi modem on, you would pay the telco money. Today you dont pay anybody anything. So, I dont agree with the view that telcos will solve every problem. What is the potential of White-Fi in terms of connecting millions to affordable Internet? If spectrum is a good owned by the people, then the right thing is you want to raise revenue from it and at the same time want to maximize the usage of spectrum. Lets assume that you raise revenue from it and the spectrum is actually not being used. Then you have a losing proposition... I dont know if (White-Fi) can solve all (connectivity) problems, but it can certainly have a positive impact and become one of the many technologies that helps. And fundamentally, in my mind, it alters the way we think about spectrum. These are important policy decisions which will alter peoples lives down the line. I do admire the US on thistheyve been much more open-minded on this. I think there is a case to be made here as well. I think it is inevitable that there will be an increasing wave of opportunism in terms of spectrum use. Its like what Andy Grove said once: if you have a great piece of technology, you can send lawyers and bureaucrats to delay it. Ultimately the technology goes around it. Can you talk about some of your work in this area? Aside from my thesis on this subject, I even have a follow-on paper that was published. Its all there in my thesisits called SATYA, which was an algorithm, a system that we built with one of my professors at Harvard, where we showed that even on top of this, you can actually raise revenues. We showed how it lowers the barrier for access to spectrum, while also increasing overall revenues. This will be an inevitable part of our futureand thats what my work shows, what are some of these challenges and how do we overcome them. And how it will fundamentally alter our view on how spectrum is used.So, what are some of the challenges facing India?In this country and every country, our issue is about how do you connect more and more people to the Internet. There are a couple of different ways in which it can happen. One, you assume there is a fibre to every home. But we both know thats prohibitively expensive to build and to maintain. Its not easy. Second, everything will be through wireless, such as 4G. I think thatll work to a certain extent, but as we have seen in other countries such as the UK and the US, if you try to wire up large portions of the country where you dont have purchasing power, then the economic argument is not justified. In my mind, Ive always felt there is some other way to connect these people. I think there is room to wire up large parts of the country with some sort of semi-unlicensed spectrum. So, are we talking about the need for a wide-scale policy overhaul in India on this matter?Absolutely. Separately, how do you view Reliance Jios entry and the current price wars that are brewing between telcos?Im a fan of anything where the consumer wins. If I can get 4G everywhere at a reasonable price, Im happy.",2016-12-10,MZp7mAMVUiI5Nm8jZaqvwK,"The founder of Murty Classical Library on his research on White-Fi, or white space network, and the focus on architecture for dynamic spectrum access in wireless networks",01:48,Spectrum in general is underutilized: Rohan Murty
258,0.24925,"In 2014, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi first placed solar energy at the core of the energy mix that would fuel Indias economic growth, scepticism abounded: how will the government deliver? Isnt the target of 100 gigawatts (GW) of solar energy, later revised to 175GW of renewable energy, by 2022, too ambitious? Also, isnt solar energy expensive? How will Indias poor afford it? Just about two years later, the answers are emergingslowly but steadily.
				   
				This past Friday, the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) called for bids to install 1GW of rooftop solar power projects on central government buildingsits largest tender yet in this segment. India is already home to the worlds largest single-location solar power plant which has been set up by the Adani Group at Kamuthi in Tamil Nadu. The 648 megawatts (MW) project, built in a record time of eight months, dislodged Californias 550MW Topaz Solar Farm in September to secure the top spot and propel India past the 10GW total capacity threshold. Indeed, huge advances have been made in the past few yearsin terms of solar energy specifically and renewable energy in general. According to a Bloomberg New Energy Finance report, the solar sector has had an impressive compound annual growth rate of 59% in the last four fiscal years and its installed capacity at the end of the FY2016 was pegged at 6.8GW. Similarly, the share of renewable energy in Indias total energy mix has also increased from 12.5% in FY2013 to 14.1% in FY2016. Yes, this also shows how fossil fuels still make up the majority of Indias energy basket but lets not ignore how quickly renewables are catching up. With a cumulative CAGR of 15%, renewables are growing at a faster rate than coal power plants, which are increasing at 12.5%. Now, place this against the backdrop of Indias large untapped renewable energy potentialaccording to the government-developed India Energy Security Scenarios, India can achieve 479GW of solar power and 410GW of wind power by 2047and it is possible to see how, if India plays its cards correctly,  solar and other forms of renewable energy may eventually drive economic growth. Specifically, India seems to be on track to achieve its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution, promised as part of the Paris pact to fight climate change, to get at least 40% of its total installed power from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030.In terms of pricing, SECI breached new frontiers yet again in November with a record low tariff offering of Rs3 per unit. The winning firm at the reverse auctionGurgaon-based Amplus Energy Solutions Pvt. Ltd, which will be installing a total of 14.5MW of solar rooftop plants across the countryhas promised these rates specifically for Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Puducherry. At one level, low tariff offering doesnt come as a surprisethis figure has been consistently falling since 2010 when it was pegged at Rs17.91 per unit; over the past few years, it had somewhat stabilized at about Rs5 per unit when the US-based SunEdison, one of the worlds largest renewable energy firms and which has now filed for bankruptcy protection, shook up the market in late 2015, offering to sell power at Rs4.63 per unit to win NTPC Ltds contract for a 500MW solar park in Andhra Pradesh. Months later, in January, Finnish company Fortum FinnSurya Energy Pvt. Ltd went a step ahead and quoted Rs4.34 per unit to secure the contract for 70MW solar plant at NTPCs Bhadla Solar Park in Rajasthan.What these low rates now mean for consumers is that solar energy, which until recently was too expensive for large-scale use in a developing country, is now on track to compete with cheap fossil fuels. Today, Indias cheapest electricity tariff is at around Rs1-2 per unit. This rate is for the farm sector which is followed by the residential sector and then the commercial sector. But while these are of course promising figures, there is still a long way to go.  The low tariffs, for example, are a double-edged sword. Driven by aggressive bids from firms desperate for a toe-hold in this sunrise sector,  they have fuelled concerns about viability and project financing, especially for those below the Rs5 per unit threshold. SunEdison, in fact, has put its India assets on the block (some of which were incidentally picked up by Amplus).  Moreover, India still has to make available the necessary capital for developing renewable energy infrastructurethe former Planning Commission had estimated under the 12th Five Year Plan that more than a trillion dollars will be requiredand it will have to work every option on the table (from domestic industry to international donors) to fund this turnaround. Similarly, several structural issues in the distribution of power need to be addressed. Indias installed capacity of 275GW is already in excess of its demand of 140GW. Yet, there are still parts of the country where there is no electricity while in many others, power cuts are the norm. This is due to a variety of factors such as coal supply shortage, transmission losses and the poor health of power utilities.As renewables enter this mix, they will have to be integrated into the existing system and structure. As a NITI Aayog expert group report notes, A probable re-engineering of institutions, the redefinition of policies, the re-tuning of power systems, and the replacement of old habits with new ones will be required. This fundamental re-structuring of the countrys power and energy infrastructure will be its biggest challenge. Can India achieve its solar power targets?

8,0.228125,"The Companies Act 2013 requires large (above a specified threshold level) firms to spend 2% of their net profits on corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects. This law came into effect in April 2014. The results on CSR expenditures by firms in the fiscal year 2015-16 were released recently. It is certainly true that Indian firms collectively are more than complying with the CSR law. According to Prime Database, Indian companies spent Rs9,309 crore on CSR projects in 2015-16, which was Rs163 crore more than the amount required by law, and Rs703 crore more than the previous year.
				   
				The general reaction in the Indian press has been positive and suggests that the CSR law has been a success. However, the CSR law is only apparently successful, and in reality is harmful.The problem is that reported expenditure on CSR projects is not a good metric of societal welfare. These numbers overstate the effect of the law. It is not clear whether firms have really increased their CSR spending after the law compared to what they were spending voluntarily before the law, because CSR spending was not well reported historically. There is some evidence that while firms that were initially spending less than 2% increased their CSR activity, but those that were initially spending more than 2% reduced their CSR expenditure. Another possibility is that firms spent money on CSR activities that also lead to increasing firm profits, such as inculcating goodwill and good public relations. There is evidence indicating CSR spending leads to brand building and employee engagement. In that case, firms would have carried out these activities with or without the law. Even if we take the CSR expenditure at face value and assume these are valid numbers, there are still major problems with the CSR law. A required expenditure that does not lead to higher profits is essentially a tax. The CSR law can be viewed as a 2% tax, albeit spent by the firms rather than given to the government. This is a back-door way to increase corporate taxes without a transparent political debate. The corporate tax rate in India is 34.61%already one of the highest, compared to a global average of 24.09%, according to KPMG, an audit and consulting company. Given the emphasis on liberalization and economic growth, it is unlikely that the Indian polity desires an increase in the corporate tax rate. This certainly will not help to make Indian firms more globally competitive nor attract more foreign investment into India.Even to the extent that there has been a real increase in socially beneficial activities, the spending has not gone to democratically determined priorities, but rather to whatever the companies prefer to emphasize. Of the nine different schedules prescribed by The Companies Act, two schedules: combating various diseases and promotion of education accounted for 44% of the total CSR expenditure, while reducing child mortality received no funding and eradicating extreme hunger and poverty received only 6% of the total CSR expenditure. Given that about 50% of children in India are malnourished due to pervasive poverty, it is unlikely that the above allocation of resources reflects the democratic will of the Indian people. It is the governments responsibility to determine high-priority needs of society and target public expenditure in these areas. With the CSR law, the government has abdicated one of its primary functions.There is also an issue of geographic equity. Five states: Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu account for well over one-quarter of all CSR spending. Towards the bottom of the list are Nagaland, Mizoram, Tripura, Sikkim and Meghalayaall from the NorthEast. This, of course, reflects the inclinations, interests, and priorities of the business sector. But, it is the responsibility of the government to help achieve a more egalitarian society.CSR is a controversial idea with many executives, academics and officials on both sides of the issue. Thus, it is not surprising that the Indian law does not clearly define CSR for the purposes of expenditures. The law lists only a few genres of CSR activities: eradicating extreme hunger and poverty, promotion of education, and social business projects. This is much too vague to work as a legal definition. It is not surprising that the law does not even discuss, let alone define, an enforcement mechanism or penalties for non-compliance.The CSR law is inherently contradictory. CSR is fundamentally an inspirational exercise, and it is very difficult to legislate aspirations. Laws only set minimum standards, but do not create an impetus for positive action. For example, it would be difficult to require that companies build excellent schools; the legal requirement can be met merely by spending money on education.Inequality in India, which was already high, has increased even more. The CSR law does not go far enough in reducing inequality and helping the disadvantaged. Without a coercive enforcement mechanism, it is unlikely that the law will result in widespread compliance and real effectiveness. In other words, required CSR will remain largely voluntary, but give the illusion of progress. This is greenwashing on a national scale!India is the first country to require companies to expend resources on CSR. There is sound logic behind why other countries have not done this, and India should not either.

94,0.2486,"Mumbai: The National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) has battled several issues this yearthere was a stand off with shareholders on its listing plans; allegations surfaced of allowing unfair access to some brokers; and managing director Chitra Ramkrishna resigned unexpectedly. 
				   
				In an interview, chairman Ashok Chawla said the initial share sale of the nations largest exchange will likely happen in the beginning of the April-June quarter after it hires a new managing director and completes corrective action based on a forensic audit to examine allegations of unfair access to its algorithm trading platform. Edited excerpts: NSE has been in the eye of a storm in the recent past. NSE is an efficient and well-oiled organization and it is not for nothing that the exchange over the years has grown from zero percent market share to 85%. In an organization, issues do come up sometime that are not necessarily defining aspects. There have been some technological issues in the past, which were resolved in 2014 and are also under investigation to prevent any future occurrences. Listing of the exchange is being pursued with a fair degree of rigour, as it is only appropriate that the existing shareholders get an exit option. Resignation of the managing director and CEO had nothing to do with thispeople come and go for many reasons. In her case it was personal reasons.The NSE management has mostly been averse to listing in the past. NSE wasnt opposed to listing, but they had two concerns the need for restructuring of the company into regulated and unregulated businesses, and a perception that if they list on a competing exchange it could lead to some troubles. Last few months the board has looked at these issues; restructuring is worth looking at at some point but that should not be something that the listing process should be held hostage to. Listing on the other exchange is the regulators decision so we will abide by that. What would be the size of the offer?The offer for sale (OFS) is not to raise money as we have adequate cash on our books. All the 70 shareholders of NSE have been asked to offer some of their shares in the OFS, which is coming to be around 20-25%. ALSO READ: NSE must list sans hubris or risk investor scornThe current Sebi rules do not allow for an overseas listing, so is the overseas listing off the table?There was some thinking initially to tap global markets through overseas listing but for now we are restricting ourselves to domestic listing. We could revisit it later. We had earlier said that by January we would file a Draft Red Herring Prospectus with Sebi but now we have preponed the timeline and would file by 20 December for a domestic listing.Issues have been raised that the NSE board examining the issues of alleged unfair access to certain brokers while accessing the algorithmic trading platform is a case of NSE investigating itself.As per the Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India) directive, we have commissioned a forensic audit to examine the allegations and the report is expected from Deloitte India in few days. We would submit the entire report to the regulator and if the board has some observations and comments to offer then we would add those. Whether there would be a fair examination of the allegations considering that NSE has commissioned the audit, you should ask the regulator. There would be some confidence that Sebi has in the NSE board.Considering the timelines you have highlighted would it be safe to say that the exchange would not list till the new CEO is in place and the issues around allegations of unfair access are resolved?Yes, we would not list till these two issues are resolved as this is the prudent thing to do. The new MD and CEO would be in place before the end of the first quarter of the coming calendar. Corrective actions based on the forensic audit in consultation with Sebi would also be finished around the same time. As to listing this would happen around the beginning of the second quarter of the calendar year. Is NSE okay with listing on a rival exchangebecause of the concerns of conflict of interest that may arise out of cross listing remain?We have requested Sebi to provide some comfort in existing regulations. For instance, in case the exchange, acting as regulator, proposes an action against an exchange which is listed on its platform perhaps it could be looked at by some external party or independent member. Sebi is positively considering the proposal, if it comes then it would give the parties some ease and if it doesnt then the philosophy behind cross listing isyou cant be a judge of your own cause and we will honour that. ALSO READ: NSE CEO exit: Examining Sebi, NSE boards roles There have been many reports pointing to differences with the board being the reason for Chitra Ramkrishnas exit from NSE.Differences with the board are something like what two people have while talking across a table, nothing more than that. At least there were no issues between the board and the ex-CEO that could have prompted such a move on her part, so to that extent I deny (these claims). Reportedly, the board was concerned about the appointment of the group chief operating officer Anand Subramanian. So, are you saying that the board had no concerns on his appointment?Well, there is no merit in visiting that issue today. This was something that happened in the past and we would like to leave it there. While BSEs Gujarat International Finance Tech (GIFT) plans seem crystallized, we have not heard much from NSE on its plans for GIFT. Would you be able to take us through your plans for GIFT City?You are right, as per the media reports BSE is launching on 9 January. You can expect NSE to launch just a little later.

43,-0.248475,"Seoul: Billionaire Shin Dong-joo has reason to be bitter. In the past couple of years, hes been suspended by his father, fired by his younger brother and indicted on charges of embezzlement by South Korean prosecutors.
				   
				Yet the former No. 2 at Lotte Group says hes confident hell clear his name in court, overthrow his brother as chairman and seize control of a business empire that generates more revenue than Google Inc. or Airbus Group. His plan is to take advantage of the groups complex network of more than 70 cross shareholdings. If he can gain the votes of minority shareholders in one Japanese unit that binds the whole conglomerate together, he says he can effectively control the group.My final target is to take control of Lotte, Shin, 62, said in his office in Seoul in his first interview with foreign media. My brother and the current management destroyed (Lottes) good corporate culture.Shin is attempting to pull off a unique coup in Korean corporate historythe takeover of one of the countrys giant family-run business groups, known as the chaebol. If he succeeds, hell take charge of the nations largest chain of shopping malls, duty-free stores, hotels and amusement parks, one whose overseas assets include Guylian Belgian chocolates and New Yorks Palace Hotel. ALSO READ: Lotte scraps $4.5 billion hotel IPO as probes deepen crisisCoup attemptsIts a big if. His brother Shin Dong-bin, chairman of Lotte Group, outguns him in terms of resources and has already fended off numerous coup attempts. The brothers given names will be used in this article for clarity.No coup has ever succeeded among the chaebol, said Chung Sun-sup, CEO of Chaebul.com, a website that tracks the chaebol. He said Dong-joos best chance would be if his brother was convicted as a result of the investigation this year into corruption at the company. Dong-joo has also been charged but both brothers deny the allegations. Meanwhile, the family feud is hurting Lotte and has added another stain to the embattled reputation of the chaebol groups this year, which have already suffered the bankruptcy of Hanjin Shipping Co., Samsung Electronics Co.s exploding phones and an influence-peddling scandal that cost President Park Geun-hye her job.The battle at Lotte is among the fiercest corporate power struggles in Asia -- rivaling the brawl raging atop Indias Tata Group -- as some of the regions biggest dynasties undergo a once-in-a-generation leadership change.Lotte was founded seven decades ago by Shin Kyuk-ho in Japan, where he had earlier attended Waseda University. He started out selling chewing gum and built a business empire in Japan and Korea. The two brothers grew up together in Japan, with the elder learning to run the Japanese units and the younger taking charge of the Korean part.The trouble began when the ailing patriarch, now 94, fired his eldest son Dong-joo in January 2015 and took away some of his voting rights. Dong-joo says he was removed because the president of Lotte Holdings, Takayuki Tsukuda, falsely told his father that he was responsible for causing losses. Dong-joo said the accusations were part of a plan to wrest control of the company.Fathers forgivenessThe first thing for me to do was to persuade my father about the real situation, Dong-joo said. It took several months to change his mind.He did. In July 2015, the patriarch flew to Tokyo to overturn the dismissal but was thwarted when Dong-bin, Tsukuda and Chief Financial Officer Masamoto Kobayashi refused to meet him, according to a copy of testimony Dong-joo gave to Korean prosecutors earlier this year. The next day, the trio called an emergency board meeting and ousted the groups founder as the head of Lotte Holdings.Lotte Holdings declined to comment on any of the ousted executives allegations and wouldnt make Tsukuda or Kobayashi available for comment.Lotte Group said in a statement to Bloomberg News that Dong-joo was fired because he made unauthorized investments in a software venture that led to about 1 billion yen ($8.7 million) in losses. Lotte Chairman Dong-bin, 61, wasnt available for an interview, the group said.To insist one should be able to reclaim the company just because hes the owners son shows he has an outdated perspective and sees the company as a personal belonging Lotte said. Dong-joo is remorseless and lacks managerial competence, according to the statement.China expansionDong-joo said his brother is the one who is shortsighted. Dong-bin should be blamed for changing Lottes culture to one where managers constantly fear getting fired, he said. He also blamed Dong-bins expansion in China for what he estimated to be 2.4 trillion won ($2.1 billion) in losses for the group.The best players come to China and fight like at the Olympics, Dong-joo said in an interview in the Gran Seoul building, a block away from Lottes headquarters in the South Korean capital. The current management team underestimated the situation. Timeline of events that have roiled Lottes Shin familyLotte couldnt confirm the amount of the China losses. It said that Dong-bin is a proven leader who increased the groups annual sales to about 90 trillion won, from 26 trillion won in 2004, and pushed for the listing of Lotte Shopping Co. to enhance transparency. The chairman has a strategy to enhance group transparency and become a better corporate citizen, it said.As to Dong-joo, his strategy centers around Lotte Holdings Co., the closely held Tokyo-based company that owns about 99% of Hotel Lotte Co., which in turn controls the conglomerates scores of businesses in Korea. He argues that the best way to improve the groups governance issues would be a public share sale of the holding company.Dong-joo commands 33.3% of votes at Lotte Holdings, theoretically giving him a larger say than the 22.3% directly controlled by the Japanese executives. But there is also a 31% block of shares owned by 130 employees that is represented by a single union delegate whos been siding with Dong-bin. Should the delegates vote be broken up, Dong-joo said he could get the majority he needs.Dong-joo declined to specify how hed change the employee voting system, which was set up by his father decades ago, but said there are legal steps that his team is working on. His supporters include Min Euoo-sung, 62, the former Korea Development Bank chairman who placed a failed bid for Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. before its bankruptcy, and Cho Moon-hyun, an attorney at DW Partners.Lotte said the employee union sided with Dong-bin in light of his managerial skills, while Dong-joo should be ashamed of losing the support of the Lotte Holdings staff. Union representatives werent available to comment.Dong-joo says his brother is only a pawn in a battle being controlled by Tsukuda and Kobayashi. As he tells it, the majority of votes at Lotte Holdings are effectively controlled by the Japanese executives as his younger brother only holds 1.6% of the voting rights.They can fire my brother anytime, Dong-joo said. My brothers position is not stable. While the brothers feud rages, Lotte is facing other crises.Corruption indictmentsIn October, South Korean prosecutors indicted five members of the family, including both brothers and their father, after a four-month investigation, accusing the Shin clan of engaging in financial crimes amounting to almost 280 billion won. Dong-joo was also charged with embezzling 39 billion won, which he denies. Lotte Group said most of the allegations against his brother, Dong-bin, involve events during the time their father was running the group. Other family members could not be reached for comment.Separately, Dong-bin had to answer allegations from parliament, along with other chaebol leaders, that Lotte and the other big business groups gave bribes to foundations controlled by Choi Soon-sil, the confidante of impeached Korean President Parkaccusations Dong-bin and Lotte Group deny.The scandals have taken a toll on Lottes businesses. The company scrapped a potential $4.5 billion initial public offering of a hotel unit and withdrew a multi-billion-dollar bid for chemicals-maker Axiall Corp. Prior to its deals freeze, Lotte was the most active Korean conglomerate in terms of mergers and acquisitions over the past six years, according to corporate watchdog CEOScore.For Dong-joo, the crises at Lotte are representative of what he says are managements missteps. He says he has a message for his estranged brother, with whom he hasnt spoken in months. Youd better apologize to my father and come back to Shin family, Dong-joo said. As a family, we should be united. BloombergGrace Huang also contributed to this story.",2016-12-16,644n0DkZZlIjzpFHzGm9bN,"Billionaire Shin Dong-joo says hes confident hell clear his name in court, overthrow his brother as chairman and seize control of Lotte Group that generates more revenue than Google or Airbus ",18:58,Inside a banished Korean billionaires plot to overthrow his brother
219,0.054225,"For a moment, it looked like Indias Tata Group could stop worrying about a split, and go back to making Jaguar cars, selling Tetley tea, running Taj hotels and writing software for global banks.
				   
				On Monday night, Cyrus Mistryunceremoniously dumped as group chairman two months agoended his high-decibel bid to hang around at operating companies that had called shareholder meetings to oust him.But Mistrys resignation from those boards is perhaps only a recognition that he was going to lose the proxy fight. Ratan Tata, who engineered the coup against Mistry at holding company Tata Sons Ltd, wont be resting easy. The founding familys tenuous control of the $103 billion conglomerate cant be taken for granted.With Mistry promising to shift the battleground, a far messier skirmish lies ahead. The risk is no longer of a split in the empire; now, just by being patient and uncompromising, Mistry could in theory get all of it.The ousted chairman says he will take the fight to a platform that can uphold the rule of law. Courts, however, are unlikely to get involved in deciding whether Ratan Tata kept meddling in the operating companies after handing over the reins four years ago.Also read: The options before Cyrus MistrySimilarly, Mistrys insinuations of insider trading might baffle the securities regulator. It would be one thing to show that trustees of Tata Trusts, philanthropic institutions that control two-thirds of Tata Sons, asked and got unpublished, price-sensitive information about publicly listed units, but quite another to prove that any of them enriched themselves or others.Alleged financial fraud and violation of foreign-exchange laws at Tata Groups joint-venture airline with Malaysias AirAsia Bhd might pose a more serious challenge, and even ethical lapses that arent necessarily crimes would serve their purpose. If the fog is thick enough to keep the conglomerate on front pages of newspapers for all the wrong reasons, an irritated government might be forced to intervene in Tata Trusts on the grounds that they have gone astray from their charitable mission.Assume Ratan Tata is no longer able to control Tata Trusts. Then, as the second-largest investor in Tata SonsMistrys family owns more than 18%the deposed leader gets to shape the groups destiny.It wont be that easy. If Ratan Tata, whos back as interim chairman of the holding company, can quickly find a strong successor to look after the empire, he can regain his footing. That would allow him to broach a compromise from a position of strength. Theres already a proposal to list Tata Sons. Citigroup Inc. drew up a detailed plan some time back. Implementing it would unlock value for Mistrys shareholding, too.Whether the deal works depends on Mistrys risk preference: The longer he drags on the conflict, the more the loss of wealth for all shareholders, including himself. But Mistry, 48, has one advantage over his 78-year-old-adversary: time.The onus to settle the feud is on Ratan Tata, and the younger man must know that, too.

411,0.2431,"Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) said it has signed a binding agreement with Brookfield Infrastructure Group to sell its tower assets. 
				   
				It will receive an upfront payment of Rs11,000 crore, besides B class non-voting shares in the tower company.These shares will provide 49% future economic upside from the business, based on certain conditions, the company said in a statement.The long pending sale failed to cheer both stock market investors and credit rating agencies. RComs market capitalization has risen by around Rs200 crore since the deal was announced. This is no more than a drop in the ocean, considering that the companys market capitalization had fallen by around Rs13,000 crore so far this year. Investors seem to be ruling out any major upside from the 49% holding through non-voting shares. The value of the retained stake depends on the conditions set by Brookfield, which are currently unknown. According to an analyst with a domestic institutional brokerage, It is evident investors arent factoring in an upside from the retained stake; after all, RComs market value hasnt changed dramatically and still is only around Rs8,900 crore.As the things stand, i.e. assuming that the Rs11,000 crore valuation for a 51% stake is fair, RComs towers have been valued at around $74,000 each. This is understandably at a huge discount to Bharti Infratel Ltd, whose towers are valued at around $100,000. One of RComs large tenants, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, is reported to have contracted rentals that are considerably lower than market rates. As such, profitability and return ratios of RComs tower assets are likely to be lower than peers.Its also important to note that credit rating agency Moodys Investors Service has retained its cautious view on RComs debt. RComs B1 corporate family and senior secured ratings remain on review for downgrade despite signing a binding agreement with Brookfield Infrastructure in relation to the sale of RComs tower assets, Moodys said on Thursday. As the rating agency points out, there are still a number of imponderables. The wireless entity that will emerge after the proposed merger with Aircel is expected to be heavily indebted. Operationally, the wireless business is expected to be among the worst hit as big boys Jio and Bharti Airtel fight it out by lowering tariffs. It also remains to be seen whether the retained businessincluding undersea cableswill be able to service the debt that remains on the companys books.An RCom investors best bet is that the firms books are adequately spruced up to make it a suitable match for an acquirer such as Jio. And even if that happens, its far from a foregone conclusion that RCom investors will get a good deal.",2016-12-23,vTm9ydYQTCyFV9R1RGlVDI,"RCom will receive an upfront payment of Rs11,000 crore, besides B class non-voting shares in the tower company",08:14,RCom deleveraging fails to impress investors
422,0.229625,"Adversity brings out the best or the worst in people. The downturn in Indias start-up funding market over the past 12 months brought out the worst in the founders of some of the countrys most valuable start-ups. 
				   
				Strapped for capital and under assault from foreign competitors with deep pockets, such founders came down to playing the nationalist card and seeking the governments help in keeping non-Indian players out of the market.For Indias venture capital industry, on the other hand, the downturn has been a time to introspect, salvage, consolidate and rebuild.We look at some of the highs and lows that marked the countrys venture capital market in the past 12 months.1. The year started in the shadow of the first serious downturn that this market has seen in the decade since venture capital re-established its roots here as an asset class. Hedge funds, which fanned a valuation bubble in the start-up funding market for nearly two years, had fled late last year, leaving behind a yawning gap in the late-stage funding market. Hedge funds may have deserted the start-up market but global limited partners, institutional investors who back venture capital funds, stayed committed, in fact, upped their commitments. Two of the countrys biggest ever venture capital funds were raised in the last 12 months. In February, Sequoia Capital India, the countrys largest venture capital firm, raised a massive $920 million fund, dwarfing even some of the big private equity funds raised here lately. Last month, Accel Partners India closed commitments for a $450 million fund, only the second fund of that size since the one raised by Nexus Venture Partners in December last year. Limited partner commitments have also flowed into smaller funds. In May, Bengaluru-based Saama Capital raised a $31 million third fund. In October, Mumbai-based Blume Ventures closed $60 million in commitments for its second fund. By London-based researcher Preqins estimates, as of September, Indias venture capital industry was sitting on dry powder, or uninvested capital, worth more than $3 billion.2. Limited partners, however, remain concerned about poor returns on their past investments. In a bid to alleviate those concerns, fund managers at venture capital firms went into overdrive to shore up exits. The numbers for the closing quarter of 2016 are yet to come in. However, in the nine months of the year ended September, venture capital firms closed 54 exit deals worth $1.41 billion, exceeding the 43 exit deals worth 1.39 billion closed in all of 2015, according to data compiled by Chennai-based researcher Venture Intelligence.The exit run isnt yet as robust as both limited partners and fund managers would like, but a handful of deals set this year apart. In July, online travel services company Yatra delivered a partial exit to its investors, Norwest Venture Partners, TV18 Group and Valiant Capital, when it struck a reverse merger with Nasdaq-listed special purpose acquisition company Terrapin 3 Acquisition Corp. The deal involved an $80 million cash payout to Yatras investors. Yatra debuted on Nasdaq this week following the completion of the merger. Another significant deal was the August acquisition of payments company Citrus Payments Solutions by South African internet conglomerate Naspers in a $130 million all-cash deal, a rare event in Indias venture capital market. The deal was a big payday for Sequoia Capital India, which had invested about $10 million over three funding rounds for a reported 32% stake. The offline retail sector served up a surprise big exitin August, private equity firm TA Associates bought an undisclosed stake in womenswear maker TCNS Clothing Co. for $140 million. Most of that went into buying Matrix Partners undisclosed stake in the company, earning the venture capital firm a 5x return on its original investment.3. Not all exits were happy events. As venture capital firms got to work consolidating their past investments, fire sales, write-offs and stock-swap deals were equally visible through the year. Things kicked off early with the much speculated January acquisition of property search and listings platform Commonfloor by online classifieds platform Quikr in a reported all-stock deal. The deal gave Commonfloors backers, Tiger Global Management, Accel Partners India and Google Capital, who collectively invested more than $60 million in the company, stakes in Quikr. In May, another troubled start-up, TinyOwl, was ushered into a stock-swap merger by its investors. The online food ordering service merged with hyperlocal delivery service Roadrunnr. The combined entity now operates as Runnr, with Sequoia Capital, Nexus Venture Partners, Matrix Partners and Blume Ventures as investors. The four venture capital firms had collectively pumped close to $40 million into the two companies prior to the merger.Rocket Internet, the Berlin-based start-up incubator and investor was involved in two deals that are widely believed to be distress sales. In April, it sold its online furniture store FabFurnish to Kishore Biyanis Future Group for an undisclosed sum and in July, online fashion store Jabong was picked up by e-commerce company Flipkart for just $70 million, a massive erosion from the $503 million Jabong was valued at in 2013. The other notable distress sale this year was Titans acquisition of a majority stake in jewellery e-tailer Caratlane for $53 million in May. The deal just about enabled Caratlanes backer Tiger Global to cover its reported investment of $52 million. By most accounts, the consolidation and cleaning out of portfolios is still well underway and will continue well into the next year. The portfolio to watch, though, will be New York-based hedge fund Tiger Globals 60-odd start-up investments here, including e-commerce bellwether Flipkart.4. The sticky issue of leadership transition in the venture capital industry found itself in the spotlight this year in the aftermath of a bitter spat in December last year within the investment team at Helion Venture Partners. Helion is one of Indias oldest home-grown venture capital firms and it came apart at the seams when its second line of partners, Alok Goyal, Rahul Chowdhri and Ritesh Banglani, quit the firm in a huff. The younger partners wanted more of a say in how the firm was run and a greater share of profits. The founding partners, Sanjeev Aggarwal, Rahul Chandra and Ashish Gupta, didnt share that view. The standoff exposed the fragile power equations that exist in what is still a fairly nascent industry. The incident served as a wake-up call to several other venture capital firms that have been around as long as Helion and will hopefully deter such ugly and public quarrels in future.5. Sometimes, even the ugliest fights have good outcomes. Helions Goyal, Chowdhri and Banglani have since started up on their own with Stellaris Venture Partners and are in the middle of raising their debut fund. Earlier this year, SAIF Partners principals Mukul Singhal and Rohit Jain broke away from the firm, amicably, to start their own seed investments-focused venture capital firm Pravega Ventures. Earlier, former Ventureast partners Sateesh Andra and Ramesh Byrapaneni struck out on their own to launch Endiya Partners, focused on seed and Series A investments, and raised initial commitments for their debut fund in January. When seasoned fund managers strike out on their own, especially in the midst of a downturn, it is the surest sign of a venture capital market that is maturing.Snigdha Sengupta is a consulting writer with Mint.

371,0.249125,"Mumbai: Shankar Sharma, vice-chairman and joint managing director of First Global Securities Pvt. Ltd, is known for his strong and contrarian views. He thinks that the demonetisation exercise will affect larger companies more than smaller ones. Edited excerpts from an interview:
What do you make of the unexpected set of events, Brexit, demonetization and Donald Trumps win, that impacted Indian markets?I would not say the events were unexpected. After the great financial crisis, extremist politics has become popular across the world, be it Modis win here or Trumps win in the US.I think by now, we should be used to weird things happening. I think 2008 was a watershed moment for the world, not only because of the financial crisis, but because of the impact it had on peoples mindset and psychology. It hit them hard that they lost their jobs, their savings dwindled and so on. They were then willing to gamble with their politics, or take a blind, under-analysed bet on anyone who promised them these basics. People have been hurt widely since 2008they are angry, bewildered why their perfect lives suddenly went badand smart politicians across the world have leveraged on this by showing easy cures and fantasy fixes. The extremist politics is just peoples answer of their outrage to why us? That is what also led to events that we saw in 2016.How do you see 2017 panning out for Indian markets?I am very negative on large cap (stocks) in India in light of the recent demonetization. I was tepid about them before. I am, however bullish on Indian small cap stocks and micro-cap stocks.Demonetization has been a big, big shock to companies earnings and economic growth. The near-term impact is significant. I do not hold out much hope for large caps in terms of their ability to recover quickly. Banks will be the hardest hit as there is no credit offtake and (there is) a slowdown in demand. It may even hit recovery of loans, and even add marginally to non-performing assets.Why are you bullish on small caps and micro-cap stocks?They dont necessarily have to bank on government or strong domestic economic growth per se. Small companies can find a niche area, a good product or they find demand from a specific industry. So, I find many of those attractive bets in small and micro space. Some of those companies have corrected, and valuations are pretty attractive.Where do Indian equities stand vs emerging market peers in 2017?Before demonetization, I was reasonably optimistic on India outperforming emerging markets or at least performing in line with them. India was going to stand a little behind commodity-producing markets, which had rallied on the back of a recovery in commodity prices. There was, however, a good monsoon after two bad years, and consumption was finally looking up. There was general optimism on earnings growth, which has been very tepid in the last few quarters.However, post demonetization, things have turned bad, at least for a few quarters. I think India is now going to lag other emerging markets in 2017.Whatever tepid growth rate we were seeing, that also is in question right now. Also, post a shock like that, while people say it will hurt the economic growth for one or two quarters, the point is nobody knows. Macroeconomics is not arithmetical. It is not like I give x input and y output is delivered. Sometimes, it may happen, sometimes it may not, and sometime a completely un-modelled thing may happen.It is very clear that the economic growth momentum is broken. How does it come back, how much you need to stimulate for it to come back and whether we have the firepower to stimulate that much, we do not know. So, suddenly from being reasonably okay position, we are in a situation where we need to invest hugely to repair the damage.If you are thirsty, you drink a glass of water. But if you are dehydrated, you need to be put on the drip. Now, the stimulus has to be disproportionate to the loss the economy is suffering. Does the government have that ammo?Do you think demonetisation was a wrong move by the government?That is not a call I can take. It is for the government to make these decisions.Do you think there are more negatives than positives from it?If you want to look at it from the lens of politics, I think it is a terrific move. If you look at it from the economic or financial lens, its a very muddled picture. For a government in power, the objective is to win elections at any cost. If this helps them achieve this, I think it is all okay, because ultimately like an asset management companys sole purpose of existence is to gather assets, the sole purpose of a political party is to win elections. Period. Performance etc. are all secondary.The goods and services tax is set to be implemented next year. How do you see things shaping up post its implementation?Even before demonetization, the general consensus has been that there will be a near-term impact of adjustment and understanding of GST on economic growth. There are various factors that come into play when a big change like this is introduced. So, even without demonetization, it would have had a significant near-term impact in terms. Now, post demonetization, we are looking at a double whammy to the economy in the immediate future after its implementation.What is your budget wishlist ?I am not a big budget analyst or a big budget watcher. In my view, Indian budgets are generally fairy tales and I dont believe in fairy tales. I dont waste my time analysing it. I think it is just a statement of intent. I dont listen to what they (government) say, I only watch what they do.Private investment demand has not revived for a long time. What is the missing piece that can help revive this?This government has decided as the Big Brother that I will do the all the spending in the economy because I know better than an individual consumer as to where to spend.So, if you see all the economic auctionsall money flows to the government that obviously gives them the power on how low the pricing for telecom etc. can gothe government has decided the economy belongs to them, and not the citizens; and they will decide how economic gains are spent, not the citizens.As we enter 2017, which sectors do you really like in Indian markets, and which sectors would you avoid?The one sector I will definitely avoid is banks. Banks have been over-owned in India. In such a situation, upside usually gets capped. After demonetization, private lenders will suffer as consumption hits a hurdle. Public sector banks that primarily lend to industries were, as it is, going through bad times. The economic slowdown is going to hurt even more than before.",2016-12-26,oxgZihdWTzj0Ns5iw0SCNN,Shankar Sharma of First Global Securities believes demonetisation will affect larger companies more than smaller ones,00:51,I think India is going to lag other emerging markets next year: Shankar Sharma
297,0.0394,"The post-demonetization narrative that initially saw banks as the biggest beneficiaries of a deposit delugea massive Rs12.4 trillion at last counthas now morphed into a more balanced one now.
				   
				Deposits are a cost until you get the money off your back through lending and that is not happening. Business was hard to come by in 2016 for bankers and 2017 is going to be even harder. Companies have stopped borrowing and the few who did, borrowed from the bond market. Bankers themselves are preoccupied with fixing bad loans rather than going after new customers. As a consequence, the loan book expanded at an unflattering single-digit pace. But the currency withdrawal worsened it to 5.76% as of 9 December, a glacial pace not seen in more than half a century.So, banks have now opted to go all out to stoke the dying embers of credit offtake by cutting lending rates. And the cuts are not the typical piecemeal affair, but a deep slash unseen in many years. State Bank of India dropped its benchmark lending rate by a massive 90 basis points and others such as Dena Bank, Union Bank of India and Punjab National Bank have followed suit. Eventually, everyone else will begin cutting rates too.Bankers and analysts seem to think that this will light a fire under the bank loan book. Firstly, many bankers are betting on pent-up demand and expect retail loan growth to gallop once the dust settles on demonetization. This is quite possible as most individuals would have postponed their discretionary spending to a future date. Two weeks into demonetization, retail loan growth slowed to 15.2% from 18% a year ago, data on credit as of 25 November from the Reserve Bank of India showed.Secondly, pockets like affordable housing will do well because currency withdrawal has dampened real estate prices to some extent and the government aims to boost rural housing under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. Indeed, home loans in the priority sector grew by 6.6% in November, a bit faster than 6.1% a year ago and this is a credible sign of the affordable space performing better.In all this, the cost to banks will be an erosion of margins but this will be minimal. Banks have already cut deposit rates deeply and the loan rate cuts announced since Friday were expected. Also, analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd point out that under marginal cost-based lending rate, banks can choose interest rate reset dates and in retail loans, these are elongated. This means that transmission will take time.Which is why investors may soon return to bank stocks despite the shares taking a beating on Monday.",2017-01-03,cFqxiOG42uSxFrAfjuxh2I,"And the cuts are not the typical piecemeal affair, but a deep slash unseen in years",07:52,Are lending rate cuts a desperate attempt to stoke the dying embers of credit offtake?
35,0.243775,"Amid all manner of disclosures, some quite unsavoury, in the Cyrus Mistry vs. Ratan Tata battle, the one silver lining has been how neither camp has accused the other of personal excesses. So while Mistry has suggested the groups pursuit of a small car for the Indian middle class was no more than a personal fancy of Tata and should be wound up, the accusation never extended to how the man who ran the group for over 20 years went and splurged on a gold plated Rolls Royce for himself. 
				   
				Indeed, till the time Tata Motors Ltd bought Jaguar Land Rover, the group owner would often squeeze himself into one of the more plebian cars the company made.In truth, most of Indias company owners and founders have conservative lifestyles with few of the wild and exotic indulgences that we associate with the billionaire lifestyle across the world. Sample this: in January 2014, the Dallas Safari Club, a hunters rights organization, auctioned off a permit which would allow the holder to travel to Namibia for the chance to kill one of only 5,000 surviving black rhinos. The auction was won by oil heir and Texas hunter Corey Knowlton, who bid $350,000 for that dubious right.It isnt the kind of thing that Tata or Kumar Mangalam Birla or Mukesh Ambani, or a dozen other Indian tycoons are likely to be doing on their summer breaks. Despite their obvious wealth, their sensibilities seem no different from that of many well-brought-up middle-class Indians of an earlier era. That shows even in the way most behave with people around them. Thus, Tata will often hold the elevator door open at Bombay House when he sees an executive rushing towards it and by all accounts Mistry is a chip off the same block.Dilip Shanghvi, founder of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and the countrys richest billionaire by some rankings, is low-key to a fault. Fortis Healthcare Ltd co-founders Malvinder and Shivinder Singh may be in the best-dressed lists of social magazines, but you are unlikely to find Prathap Reddy, founder of Apollo Hospitals or Y.K. Hamied, chairman of Cipla Ltd, displaying any sartorial vanities.Most of them dress simply, wearing suits only for meetings and even those tend to be the kind that will hardly attract attention. Tata, in fact, seems to have dropped his jacket of late, appearing in his shirt sleeves at most of the acrimonious annual general meetings of his group companies over the last few months. Clearly they are not following the example of UK-based billionaire Scott Alexander, dubbed the Vainest Man in Britain, who likes to buy out entire clothes collections, rather than just certain pieces. One year he spent £300,000 on clothes from Dolce & Gabbana.At meetings to discuss strategic plans for his group, Ajay Piramal munches on such frugal fare as khakra while Reliance Industries Ltd chairman Mukesh Ambanis fondness for vada paav is legendary. Contrast their gastronomical conservatism with that of Sean Parker, co-founder of Napster, who is known to have spent $13,000 on a single meal.Indias IT billionaires are of course in a class of their own in terms of frugality. Azim Premji, once Indias richest man, whose stake in Wipro Ltd. is worth nearly $15 billion, would often take an auto rickshaw from the old airport in Bengaluru and once threw a mini fit when he was automatically upgraded from his regular economy class seat on a Kingfisher flight to Delhi.The others, Infosys founders N.R. Narayana Murthy, Nandan Nilekani and the reclusive Shiv Nadar who set up HCL Technologies Ltd, are no different. The latters one indulgence is his Zen garden, on which he showers attentions. How utterly boring, when compared to Australian billionaire Clive Palmer, who got himself a $600 million replica of the Titanic, or another billionaire who recently ordered a diamond and gold encrusted collar for his pet dog.Of course, Indias billionaire class has its honourable exceptions and the latest gizmo or car eventually does find its way to Indian shores. But these are few, and their excesses still raise an eyebrow.",2017-01-03,4fi8FzAKiTzjZRLgF6H9LM,Most of Indias company owners and founders have conservative lifestylescontrary to exotic indulgences that are associated with the billionaire lifestyle across the world,14:47,Indias middle-class billionaires
342,0.249175,"London/Tel Aviv: When Israels richest man died in 2011, the task of splitting his vast fortune came down to a simple lottery with just two ticketsboth jackpots with billion-dollar payouts. 
				   
				After outside managers divvied up shipping magnate Sammy Ofers hundreds of tankers, container carriers, and other cargo vessels into two groups of equal value, sons Idan and Eyal each picked one out of a hat as their mother looked on.We literally reached in and grabbed an envelope, says the younger brother, Idan, 61. And thats it. It was peaceful, no drama. They did something similar with paintings by Picasso and Van Gogh and the rest of their fathers art collection. Other family assetsreal estate, bank shares, a stake in Israels biggest chemical companywere evenly divided based on the brothers involvement in the various businesses. Eyal, 66, took over Sammys stakes in Israels Mizrahi Tefahot Bank Ltd, property developer Melisron Ltd., real estate around the world, and a stake in Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Idan got control of Israels largest public holding company and various tech investments.ALSO READ: Indias middle-class billionairesIn terms of carving up colossal wealth, the Ofers did things as smoothly as possible. The brothers need look no further than their cousins Liora and Doron Ofer, the children of Sammys brother Yuli, to see how inheritance disputes can tear a family asunder. Those siblings are no longer on speaking terms after a legal squabble over Yulis stake in an investment company. Liora today controls assets valued at $2.3 billion, while Dorons share is $675 million, according to Bloomberg index calculations.Liora Ofer declined to comment for the story and Doron Ofer didnt respond to requests for comment. Eyal declined to be interviewed.Bad luck and differing appetites for risk, though, have turned Idan and Eyals equitable split into fortunes as lopsided as their cousins. Idans bank balance has been battered by a commodities slump, ill-timed investment bets, and increased scrutiny in Israel. Eyal, by contrast, has added to his wealth with office buildings and hotels across the US and Europe. When the split was finalized in 2013, both brothers were worth more than $6 billion. Idans stash has since dropped to $3 billion while the fortune of Eyal has grown to $8.6 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Tracking the value of his portfolio doesnt make me happy, Idan says, munching chocolate-covered rice cakes in his bright corner office in Londons Mayfair neighbourhood, where a large black-and-white photo of his bespectacled father peers over his shoulder. But Im used to it. And Im not a speculator. Having a background in shipping makes me comfortable with cyclical things.The brothers were born in Israel, then attended boarding school in Britain before returning home to fulfil their military service. After studying maritime law in London, Eyal worked alongside his father to expand the familys cargo shipping business. Idan, a 1982 graduate of the University of Haifa, chafed at the idea of sharing what he calls the same small office with his dad. He instead moved to Hong Kong and expanded the group into tankers.After a decade in Asia and a couple of years in New York, Idan was drawn back home. The family that owned a giant holding group called Israel Corp. Ltd was feuding and wanted to cash out. In 1999, the Ofers paid $330 million for a controlling interest in the company and Idan was appointed chairman. His homecoming was a coronation for the new prince of Israeli industry.That investment stands at the root of Idans declines. He now controls Israel Corp., whose primary asset is fertilizer giant Israel Chemicals Ltd. In 2008, filmmaker Miki Rosenthal released a documentary called The Shakshuka System, a reference to an Israeli dish of eggs and tomato sauce, which Rosenthal used as a metaphor for the Ofers relationship with politicians. The film says the Ofers used their close ties to government officials to buy state-owned companies on the cheap.Idan sued Rosenthal for libel in 2009 and the two parties settled out-of-court. Idan says he got no bargain on the companies, and that his restructuring netted the government more than $2 billion. Rosenthal, now a member of parliament with the Labour party, says Idan tried using false claims to scare and dissuade me from completing the film. Those efforts to prevent the movie from being shown aroused considerable curiosity, Rosenthal said in a statement.In 2011, middle-class Israelis took to the streets of Tel Aviv and other cities to protest the rising cost of living, often blaming the countrys business elite sometimes singling out Idan for their woes. In turn, the government hiked taxes on ICLs domestic profits and considered stripping the company of potash mines it operates near the Dead Sea.When Idan in 2012 sought to sell ICL to Potash Corp. for $13.5 billion, Israeli lawmakers torpedoed the deal, saying it was against the national interest. As the price of potash, ICLs most profitable product, has tumbled about 75% in the past eight years, the familys stake in Israel Corp.now controlled by Idanhas fallen below $1 billion, from $6.5 billion in 2008.Though Idan has since moved to London, where he oversees his empire, he doesnt link his move to the rising tensions in Israel. Im a citizen of the world, Idan says. It was time for a change.Eyal, meanwhile, has lived abroad since the 1970s and long ago minimized his role in Israel Corp., thereby skirting the tumult Idan faced. Over the years, he quietly assembled a real estate empire, starting with distressed properties on Park Avenue South in Manhattan. His deep knowledge of ships meant he was comfortable with similarly tangible (if less moveable) assets like buildings. By 1990, hed bought and sold more than 30 of them.Today, his portfolio includes more than 50 properties in four countries, ranging from a Travelodge hotel in London to splashy projects like a 43-story limestone tower on Manhattans Central Park West, where Goldman Sachs chief executive officer Lloyd Blankfein and rock star Sting live in palatial apartments that cost as much as $88 million apiece.Even as Eyal has gotten more ambitious as a developer, he has kept a remarkably low profile, says Richard Fain, chairman of Royal Caribbean Cruises, who has known Ofer for decades. Hes very focused on doing things that are right and will enhance the reputation of his family.Partners who work with Eyal describe him as disciplined and highly-involved, actively grooming his four children to take over the family business, much as his father did. William Rudin, CEO of New York developer Rudin Management Co. Inc., who teamed up with Eyal on a luxury condo project in Greenwich Village, says the next generation frequently attend meetings.Its a generational thing. Eyals kids refer to their father as chairman, says Richard Meade, managing editor at Lloyds List, a shipping industry journal. Discipline is very much his watchword.If Eyals side resembles a classic, patriarchal family business, Idans is more an assemblage of bold moonshots. Scott Borgerson, CEO of Boston-based investment firm CargoMetrics Technologies LLC, says thats what happens when one combines extreme wealth with an erudite man of disparate interests. Surrounded by society A-listers at a glitzy party in Saint-Tropez in August, the two sat late into the evening debating 18th-century British and American colonial history.I have a PhD on this and Idan was teaching me stuff, says Borgerson, whose company counts Idan as an investor. But under his intellectual curiosity he has a hard edge.Idan says real estate doesnt interest him and he avoids mature markets for their slow growth. He has backed power stations in India and Peru, a Chinese automaker, and a start-up that makes home-testing kits for urine. In 2007 he invested in Better Place, an electric-car charging station operator that soared to a valuation of $2 billion in 2011 but went bankrupt two years later.About the time Better Place was peaking, Idan gambled on an industry few but a risk-loving billionaire could afford: deepwater oil-drilling rigs. In late 2011 he listed Pacific Drilling SA on the New York Stock Exchange, which valued his 69% stake at $1.2 billion. The oil rout has since driven the stock price down 95%.Neither brother has been spared shippings historic bust. Since January, both brothers fleets have lost about $1 billion in value, according to researcher Vessels Value. That plunge, thanks to oversupply and anemic trade, might crush a smaller operator. But Eyal and Idanwho control the 20th and 25th biggest fleets in the world, Zodiac Group and Quantum Pacific Shippinghave the cash to withstand it, according to Vessels Value analyst William Bennett.Your survival in this market is your luck and having very deep pockets, Bennett says.The only thing riskier than dividing up their late fathers empire may have been running it together. Idan and Eyal say they are close, but they dont discuss business. Eyal sees himself as the custodian of a treasure he intends to pass on to his children. Idan, whose eldest son is at Harvard Business School, says hes unsure what roleif anyhis children will play in his businesses. He says only lawyers win when families stay together and eventually start fighting.How many rich brothers can you think of have stayed together and still work together? he asks. My brother and I were very peaceful about it. Hes living happily ever after and so am I. Bloomberg",2017-01-04,m49HOIKJfn3CxCICy62R9I,Israels richest Sammy Ofers estate was divided into two groups of equal value and sons Idan and Eyal each picked one out of a hat as their mother looked on ,15:55,"One winner, one loser in Ofer brothers lottery worth billions"

				Through the first three rounds of the interview, Pichai kept saying he hadnt seen or heard about Gmail. He had almost dismissed it as an April Fools Day joke when in the fourth round the interviewer told him what Gmail was.In the fifth round, he was asked to give his views about how it could be improved, recalled Pichai, Googles chief executive officer, on his visit to his alma mater, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpuror Kgp, as it is popularly known on the campus.Googles founder Larry Page wasnt sitting across the tableperhaps the reason why he secured the job, Pichai said, making light of the biggest turning point in his career.ALSO READ: Googles Sundar Pichai unveils Digital Unlocked for Indian small businesses The town of Kharagpur, which he had left with a heavy heart back in 1993, had changed a lot, but much at Kgp looks exactly the same, Pichai said, taking the stage with a sheepish smile.Some 3,500 students gave him a heros welcome as Pichai walked in wearing a powder-blue shirt, sleeves rolled up to his elbows, his eyes glimmering with excitement.The Kharagpur railway station, where he, as a fresher, was made to carry heavy bags for his seniors, now has Wi-Fi connectivity under a Google-partnered initiative. But the Nehru Hall, where he used to stay, hasnt changed much, Pichai said.Interviewed by Hitesh Oberoi, managing director and chief executive officer of Info Edge (India) Ltd, Pichai took a trip down memory lane to his years at Kgp as a student of metallurgical engineering.From the time he was a student at the institute, he always wanted to build computing products, he said, and thus wound up with Google. In his free time at IIT, he would study programming languages such as Fortran.On Indias centrality to Googles plans, Pichai said the technology giant was training some two million people to develop mobile applications.India has the potential to emerge as a powerhouse in software development, but it will take a few more years to realise that potential, he said.What India needs to become a global player in digital economy, competitive with any country in the world is cheap devicesa $30 smart phone, according to Pichai.In India, Google is working on launching its services in as many languages as possible, he said. Further, it is working with the government and state-owned enterprises such as RailTel Corp. to expand access to the Internet.It is estimated that by 2020, India will have 500 million smartphone users.ALSO READ: H-1B visa: Indian IT companies seem like latest Donald Trump casualtyIt is a great opportunity that in India, enterprises such as Google can work in collaboration with the government, Pichai said.Globally, Google will continue to focus on building capacity in machine learning and artificial intelligence, leveraging the dramatic improvement in computing speed in recent times, he said.Machine learning can make a big difference in many fields, he said, citing the example of diabetic retinopathya condition that can lead to loss of vision. Machine learning can help with early detection of diabetic retinopathy, which is key to dealing with it, he said.Asked by a student where he saw himself in 10 years, Pichai said he wasnt sure. Recalling that the first time he boarded a plane was when he made his first trip to the US, Pichai said technology is moving too fast to see 10 years into the future.And in advice to his star-struck audience, Pichai said people at Google are encouraged to aim high enough to fail. And even if you fail, you end up doing something good.",2017-01-05,GSilhu9oT1cCzPVeLPgWnJ,"Googles Sundar Pichai tells students at IIT Kharagpur what India needs to become a global player in digital economy is cheap devices, such as a $30 smartphone",18:32,"At IIT Kharagpur, Googles Sundar Pichai takes a trip down memory lane"
205,0.249275,"It is the Monday after Christmas, and I am meeting Ashish Bhasin, chairman and chief executive officer, Dentsu Aegis Network (DAN), South Asia, for lunch at San-Qi at Mumbais Four Seasons hotel. Arriving a few minutes early, I am reminded of the long boozy lunches the admen were always having in that epochal TV series Mad Men. When Bhasin walks in, a few moments later, it is with the air of easy familiarity. Bhasin has the build of a prosperous Punjabi man and the sartorial style of an adman, in his beige suit and maroon tie.
				   
				The 52-year-old says he is brash; he exults in it. I have announced that the Dentsu Aegis Network wants to be the No.2 player in the country by 2017, says Bhasin, who believes in putting pressure on himself to perform by going public with his objectives. So far, the strategy seems to have worked. In 2008, Bhasin left Lintas to join a bare-bones operation at Aegis India. Eight years later, he presides over DAN with 2,800 employees and revenue of Rs3,500 crore in the year ended December 2016.The last few years have seen Dentsu Aegis on an acquisition spree, buying companies as if they were candy. From digital marketing companies like Webchutney, Communicate 2 and Happy Creative, to public relations firm Perfect Relations and, most lately, user interface and user experience design company Fractal Ink Design Studio, Dentsu Aegis has been on a roll when it comes to the business of buying.If you are not growing, you are dying. Acquisition is something where when you talk to 20 people, four-five may come into the final consideration set. So at any point of time we are talking to four-five people. Its like a courtship, says Bhasin. He says it takes him about a year to complete an acquisition. More than the money, its the chemistry with the management team that matters. I spend a lot of time interacting with the people, across several locations. If they are too full of themselves, you know early on that this guy is never going to be a team player, says Bhasin. He says he has let good businesses go because he felt the promoters were talented but cavalier, like cowboys. Many of Bhasins learnings came from his 20 years in Lintas. When I joined Lintas (in 1988) as a management trainee, I used to be the envy of my peers. I was working on the Liril soap account, and one of our key tasks was to find the new Liril girl. We had to hang around in colleges and had to attend the auditions of bikini-clad models in a bathroom with a shower, he reminiscences.The Lintas days, where Bhasin shot commercials in curfew-struck Burma (now Myanmar), and managed everything from the health of bathrooms to the health of the balance sheet at its Chennai office, make for a fascinating backstory. But a waiter is hovering discreetly in the background. So we break to order lunch. Bhasin is a regular at San-Qi,  and recommends green Thai chicken curry and sautéed prawns, with a side serving of rice. We place the order and move on to trends in media.The whole industry is focusing on ad shots and angles. That is all very important, but guys, the cheese is moving. I dont know why people in advertising are blind, he says. Media is no longer the print and broadcast medium it used to be. The power has shifted to digital. Today people are still spending Rs3 crore to make an ad. But there are digital agencies that make very good ads for Rs30,000 and (they are) getting more views than you are getting on your Rs3 crore ad, says BhasinOur food arrives. The Thai curry is bland in a pleasing way, and the prawns are bathed in a delicate tomato gravy. No onions, Bhasin comments, as the waiter spoons out our individual helpings. That done, we return to the business of media, and to the nuts and bolts of managing a growing organization.Adding employees and acquisitions to DAN has meant that Bhasin has also had to buy or rent real estate. The Bengaluru office recently inaugurated a brand new DAN House building in Koramangala. I am a big believer in co-location; I like to have all my people together, he says, adding that he puts great store by interactions with his employees. There are no walls in my office, there is a glass partition for sound, but everybody can see everything. My email ID is known to everybody and I encourage them to write to me. Some of the best ideas come from the youngest employees, who pick up competitive information as well as knowledge of new trends. The other knowledge source of new trends has always been travel. Ï went to MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology); I went to Tokyo to see the latest advances in AI (artificial intelligence) and robotics. I am constantly keeping myself updated and shaking up my guys. Wake up, this is reality!The constant travel can be trying for his family. Yet Bhasins son Abhinay, 24, likes advertising and would like to make a career in it. His 16-year-old daughter Abhilasha plays squash for India. Wife Mayuri, a classmate from St Xaviers College in Mumbai, worked as a lecturer and then with American Express in Mumbai. Bhasin himself did his bachelors in science (zoology and biochemistry) and then a masters in business administration from Mumbais Sydenham Institute of Management Studies, Research and Entrepreneurship Education.The family likes to travel together, going on cruises, wildlife safaris, or just to their holiday home in Lonavla. There hasnt been a lot of that in the last few years though, for Bhasin hasnt managed to take time off. Its almost 3. Bhasin orders a kulfi and I take a cappuccino. And we continue our conversation.Bhasin is clearly a man on a mission. It burns me when I see any part of a clients business going out, either because they are sharing it with other agencies or because I dont have a service to offer, he says. He is determined to make DAN No.2 in the business, ahead of Interpublic Group and second only to WPP.

				The miner is expected to achieve its 2016/17 production target of 575 million tonnes and aims to raise output to 1 billion tonnes by 2020, Susheel Kumar told television news channel CNBC-TV18 in an interview.With coal accounting for about 70% of Indias power generation, the country is the worlds third-biggest producer and importer of the fuel, and government wants to boost domestic output to cut imports.Coal India, however, has failed to meet its output targets for years due to several reasons including strikes, accidents and protests.During April-December, Coal India produced 378 million tonnes, lagging behind its target for this financial year ending in March.

406,-0.2305,"London/ New York: The promise of production cuts from Opec and its partners sent oil rallying in 2016. Now traders want proof theyre delivering on those vows. It wont come easy.
				   
				The challenge: building a coherent picture from the morass of data that emerges at each step along the process, from the wellheads where the oil is produced, to the tankers that carry it, and the depots that store it.Unlike in the US, where output is published weekly, members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Opec, can take months to disclose their production. Beyond that, their data can be at odds with independent surveys, and countries have been known to cheat on such deals. With a rising US rig count offering a bearish undertone, each new hint on the accords implementation can be expected to swing prices.The market could be whipsawed more by data and headlines than in the past, said Michael Cohen, head of energy commodities research at Barclays Plc in New York, in a telephone interview. Data lags will be the primary problem in tracking cuts.Brent crude, the global benchmark, has surged 23% since 29 November, the day before the deal was sealed among Opecs members. The grade was trading at $56.86 a barrel at 1.07pm in Singapore. Future price increases for crude future will depend on a wide variety of signposts. Heres a breakdown on what to look for:UpstreamThe first indications will come at the start of next month, when media outlets such as Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters and Platts publish surveys of production. Estimates from institutions such as the International Energy Agency and US Energy Information Administration arrive a week or two later.As no ones counting barrels at Abqaiq, the Saudi oil-processing facility, these have to be modelled on computers, Barclays Cohen says. While we consider official production data published by Opec governments, we come up with our own estimates, said Lejla Villar, an analyst who estimates Opec output at the EIA, part of the US Energy Department. We look at crude oil loadings, estimated domestic consumption and refinery runs, storage, and whatever else might be relevant.Opec wont publish production levels until the middle of next month. Even then, the waters will be muddied as the organization provides two sets of data: the one used to monitor the agreement, compiled from the surveys described above, and numbers submitted directly by member governments, which can differ significantly.Monitoring the 11 non-members collaborating in the deal could be even harder, as data for the smaller producers like South Sudan and Equatorial Guinea are very patchy.At the moment its hard to be sure how much announced production cuts have been followed or matched by actual changes, said Damian Kennaby, director in the oil markets team at IHS Markit Ltd, whose estimates are among the external ones used by Opec. There are very few data on current production numbers and balances.To provide more clarity, Opec and its partners have established a monitoring committee, to hold its first meeting in Vienna from 21 January to 22 January, though the panel hasnt yet said ind detail how it will operate.MidstreamWhile the agreement applies to production, changes in exports will be felt more acutely by the international oil market. National producers notify customers months in advance what cargoes are available, which means some details on exports are already known. Iraqs shipping schedules, for instance, show the countrys sales will increase rather than decrease next month, though the country subsequently said buyers should prepare for lower volumes.Once the oil is on the water theres a range of services dedicated to following its flow, from ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg to companies such as Petro-Logistics SA and Oil Movements. Satellite-tracking means these shipments can be estimated almost in real-time.Still, a drop in exports might not guarantee a change in production, according to the EIA.The question of storage is the key unknown when estimating production using export data, said the EIAs Villar. Its difficult to know how much of the lifted crude each month comes from storage and how much from production in that particular month. Furthermore the size of the cuts, at just 4% of Opecs total output, is not necessarily enough to have an impact on the number of tankers, said Olivier Jakob, managing director at consultants Petromatrix GmbH.StockpilesClearing bloated oil inventories, rather than achieving a particular price, has always been the stated aim of Opecs intervention. The group estimates that the worlds tanks are overstuffed by more than 300 million barrels, or enough to satisfy China for almost a month.Yet if stockpiles are the most important metric, the problem is that they are perhaps the most lagging, with data from the IEA arriving about two months in arrears.The agency previously assumed inventories wouldnt drop until the end of 2017. It now estimates that Opecs cuts could start to deplete inventories as early as the first quarter, which means data from this definitive gauge would arrive in April or May. Opec, meanwhile, has said that while the deal will speed up the re-balancing of the global oil market, it wont result in demand exceeding supply until the second half of the year.Even if Opec delivers the cuts promised, theres still the risk of backsliding if their competitors in the US respond by ramping up drilling, said Chip Hodge, who oversees a $12 billion natural-resource bond portfolio as senior managing director at John Hancock in Boston. If activity picks up dramatically here, it might push other producers into cheating because of what that means for prices, he said.

231,0.247075,"Lead acid battery makers had a nice ride for many quarters on the back of high demand and good profit margins. But the road ahead may be arduous as the odds are mounting against these firms.
				   
				The two market leaders Exide Industries Ltd and Amara Raja Batteries Ltd may see weaker demand in the replacement market. This is a rub-off of weak automobile sales, mainly four-wheelers, between fiscal years 2012 and 2015. After all, replacement market sales follow automobile sales with a two- to three-year lag. A slowdown in the replacement market sales is worrisome as this segment brings in about two-thirds of the operating profit for battery makers.Next, some analysts say that there could be saturation in market share gains too. A report by Kotak Institutional Research says, Organized players (primarily Amara Raja) have outperformed industry growth due to market share gain from smaller unorganized players over the past five years. Together, Amara Raja and Exide have almost 90% market share in the four-wheeler replacement segment and further market share gains in this segment are unlikely.If at all, some growth is likely in two-wheeler replacement market sales. But then, the operating profit accretion from this segment is lower than that from four-wheelers.Also, like most other commodities, lead prices too have risen by a significant 20-25% in the last six months. This will weigh on profit margins until the battery makers are able to pass on this cost increase to consumers. Given that the replacement market growth rate is likely to be subdued, manufacturers may be cautious in increasing battery prices in the replacement market. Some brokerage firms have justifiably trimmed operating margin forecasts for both Exide and Amara Raja by about 50 basis points for FY18. Only better-than-expected sales in the next two quarters can offset the impact of rising lead prices. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.All the above factors triggered some sell-off in both company stocks since November. That said, at current levels, Amara Raja shares trade at a richer valuation (about 23 times FY18 earnings estimate) than Exides, which trade at around 17 times.

224,0.24085,"Ahmedabad: Essar Ports Ltd, one of the leading port companies in the country, is exploring the option of setting up a greenfield commercial port in Gujarat, according to three officials close to the development. 
				   
				The company has recently given a project proposal to the states maritime regulator Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB) for the same. If it materializes, this would be the companys first all commercial port in the country. Currently, the company operates five ports, all of which are largely for captive purpose although they handle some amount of third party commercial cargo as well. According to the investment proposal made to GMB, the company has proposed an investment of Rs10,600 crore for the port project and it plans to employ about 1,000 people, according to two of the three officials quoted. The company aims to develop a commercial multi-purpose port preferably in Devbhoomi Dwarka district with facilities capable of handling bulk, general cargo, liquid including petroleum and oil lubricants, chemicals and LPG.A senior GMB official in the know of the development said that the Essar Ports wants to develop a commercial port with a draft of about 18 metres with a cargo handling capacity of 100 million tonnes per annum (MTPA). Presently, there are only two commercial ports in India that handle a cargo of 100 MTPA or more including the Adani group run Mundra port in Kutch and Kandla Port Trust run government port in Kandla, Kutch. Reliance Industries captive port at Sikka near Jamnagar handles close to 125 MMTPA, which is mainly used for its refinery and petrochemical projects at nearby Moti Khavdi. Apart from cargo, Essar Ports has also proposed to set up a 5 MMTPA liquefied LNG import and re-gasification facilities for the proposed project.The state maritime board has already identified locations for greenfield ports like Kacchigadh and Maroli for private development and these would be offered to Essar for their new port. However, since this is not a captive project, as the per the states policy for private ports, the regulator might call for bidding, said the same senior GMB official quoted earlier. Essar officials when contacted refused to comment on the development. It was not immediately clear if Essar Ports and the state government would sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) at the upcoming Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit 2017, where a lot of companies are expected to sign such non-binding pacts. Essar Ports had volumes but it could not get value for commercial cargo due to limitations of a captive port. With their expertise in handling port business, a multi-purpose greenfield port in south Gujarat would be more viable as GMB has already identified few good sites in the region. Also, it has good connectivity to northern hinterland and many industries have also set up there, according to Ramesh Singhal, chief executive, i-Maritime Consultancy, which tracks the port and shipping sector.In October, the Essar group promoters Ruia family signed a deal with Russias Rosneft and partner consortium to sell their 98% stake in Essar Oil. The $12.9 billion deal included the 20 MTPA Vadinar refinery and Vadinar Port in Gujarat. It is likely to close by March. The company had said in a 15 October statement that the deal would help Essar deleverage almost 50% of its Rs88,000 crore debt and substantially reduce interest costs. Essar Ports current has a cargo handling capacity of 140 MMTPA which it plans to expand to 194 MMTPA over the next few years. Essar Ports has five operational port terminals at Hazira, Vadinar, Paradip, Salaya and Vizag Iron Ore and is estimated to handle approximately 90 MMT of cargo during FY17.",2017-01-09,UNi2kAWd2saMHnFEp0VJSP,"Essar Ports aims to develop a commercial multi-purpose port preferably in Devbhoomi Dwarka district, if Gujarat Maritime Board grants permission ",10:37,"Essar Ports plans Rs10,600 crore greenfield port in Gujarat"

				A stronger US dollar also weighed as the currency surge made it more expensive to hold dollar-denominated commodities. Brent crude futures were down $1.01, or 1.8%, at $56.09 a barrel at 3.36pm. US crude futures were trading at $52.99 per barrel, down $1, or 1.85%.We see the optimism surrounding Opec and non-Opec production cuts being counterbalanced by fears of higher US crude production as the higher rig count of last Friday still weighs, said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro.Last week, US energy companies added oil rigs for a tenth week in a row, Baker Hughes data showed, extending a recovery in activity into an eighth month as crude prices remained at levels at which many drillers can operate profitably.This raised concerns that US production is increasing and undermining efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and others to cut output.Rising exports from Iran also added to bearish sentiment. Iran has sold more than 13 million barrels of oil held on tankers at sea, capitalising on its exemption from a global deal to cut production in order to regain market share and court new buyers.In Iraq, Opecs second-biggest producer, a record 3.51 million barrels per day (bpd) were exported from its port in Basra in December, officials said, although they added that the country would comply with its commitment to lower output by an average of 210,000 bpd from January.On the other hand, Russia, one of the worlds largest crude producers, appeared to be sticking to the agreement to cut as Russian energy market sources told Reuters the countrys output had slipped in the first week of the month.Oil and gas condensate output averaged 11.1 million bpd from 1 January to 8 January, down from Octobers 11.247 million bpd.

216,-0.240475,"London/ Singapore: Oil prices stabilised on Tuesday after a sharp sell-off as a fall in the dollar triggered a bout of short-covering, but analysts said the market remained vulnerable to further falls.
				   
				Rising oil prices through December encouraged investors to buy large volumes of crude oil futures contracts and many of these long positions are likely to be unwound unless the market stays strong, analysts and brokers say.I see this as a dead cat bounce, said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank in Copenhagen. Oil is unlikely to recover until the longs have been reduced.Tamas Varga, analyst at London broker PVM, agreed. We are seeing some short covering on the back of a weaker dollar, Varga said. We might see stronger prices today after yesterdays big fall, but the market should weaken in coming days. I believe we are going lower.Oil is priced in dollars, so a weaker dollar tends to encourage buying by consumers holding other currencies. Brent crude was up 20 cents a barrel at $55.14 by 3.20pm. US light crude oil was up 25 cents at $52.21.Both crude contracts fell more than $2 a barrel, or around 4%, on Monday on doubts that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and other key oil producers would cut output as promised to try to reduce a global oversupply.Opec members Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi both appear to be reducing production but it is not clear whether other big producers such as Iraq will follow suit. Supplies are also increasing in North America. The average Canadian rig count for December 2016 was 209, up 36 from the 173 counted in November 2016, and up 49 from the 160 counted in December 2015, said Matt Stanley, a fuel broker at Freight Services International in Dubai. A 30% increase in Canadian rigs in a year ...

71,0.24485,"New Delhi: Bankrupt clean-energy giant SunEdison Inc. is exiting its business in India by selling 1.7 GW of wind and solar farms to Greenko Energies Pvt. Ltd, according to two executives with direct knowledge of the transaction.
				   
				Greenko, backed by the sovereign wealth funds of Abu Dhabi and Singapore, took over SunEdison sites in September that include ones with 440 MW of capacity already operating and another 1,200 MW of projects still under development, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media. The assets are valued at about $500 million, one of the people said.The sale ends the foray of SunEdison, once the worlds biggest renewable energy company, into the second-most-populous nation. It sets Greenko up to profit from Prime Narendra Modis goal of boosting clean energy capacity to 175 GW by 2022.SunEdison, which filed for bankruptcy protection in April, listed $16.1 billion of debt in court filings, making it the biggest US bankruptcy of 2016. The year before, it won the right to build 500 MW of solar power in Andhra Pradesh with a record low bid of Rs4.63 kilowatt-hour.Winding downThat project will now be completed by Greenko by 31 March, according to, M. Kamalakar Babu, managing director of New & Renewable Energy Development Corporation of Andhra Pradesh. Development costs could top Rs2,500 crore, according to estimates by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.Elements of the deal between SunEdison and Greenko have been emerging since September after the Economic Times reported a deal between the two companies. In October, Fitch Ratings put the enterprise value of the transaction, thought at the time to involve about 390 MW of operational assets, at $392 million.While the bulk of the projects have been bought by Greenko, some have gone to Terraform Global Inc., which said in September that it wouldnt hinder the sale of assets in India.

202,0.249475,"CES debuted gadget hits like the VCR, CD player and Xbox over the years, but the popular consumer electronics conference also showcases a lot of technology that fails to match the hype.
				   
				Some of the top flops from 50 years of the Las Vegas show include Digital Audio Tape players, Apples Newton handheld computer and Ataris Jaguar gaming console. Here are some of the more recent disappointments from CES.1) Smart GlassesGoogle kicked off a wave of optimism about internet-connected eyewear when it unveiled Google Glass at its developer conference in April 2013. At CES in early 2014, there were a bunch on show, including the Epson Moverio BT-200 and Vergence Labs Epiphany glasses which let the wearer control drones with hand gestures. As of early 2017, there were no mainstream smart glasses selling in high volumes. Google Glass flopped. Apple Inc. is working on the technology, but hasnt released a product yet.2) 3D PrintersThis was the anointed technology at CES 2013. The CubeX from 3D Systems Inc. won a Best of CES for emerging technology that year. 3D printers have made steady progress since then, especially for industrial uses, but they arent in a lot of homes or offices. MakerBot, a pioneer in the sector that had a strong presence in 2013, has cut staff amid declining sales. Stratasys Ltd. bought MakerBot in 2013, and its share price hit a record in January 2014. The stock is down more than 75% since then. 3D Systems shares are down about the same amount in that period.3) Lily, GoPro DronesStartup Lily Robotics won a coveted CES 2016 innovation award for its autonomously steered camera drone. A working version of the gadget wasnt shown at the conference and shipping dates have been delayed. GoPro Inc. founder Nick Woodman took to the stage at the same CES to tease more information about his companys Karma drone. That gadget finally went on sale in October, but the company recalled thousands of them after they lost power. GoPro was back at CES this year showing off the Karma and the company said it will re-launch the drone later in 2017.4) HoverboardsAt CES 2016, makers of hoverboards battled over which company came up with the technology and related designs. The electric skateboards were gaining in popularity, thanks in part to celebrities like Justin Bieber posting shots of themselves zipping around on the devices. So there was a lot at stake. But things turned sour when US federal marshals raided the CES booth of a Chinese hoverboard maker. Future Motion, a Silicon Valley startup, said it invented and patented a self-balancing electric skateboard that looked strikingly similar to the ones the marshals confiscated. Less than two months later, Amazon.com Inc. and other big retailers stopped selling hoverboards after the US Consumer Product Safety Commission deemed them unsafe, saying they pose an unreasonable risk of fire if they didnt meet voluntary safety standards. No hoverboards on the market met those standards, it added at the time.5) PebblePebble Technology Corp. was the belle of the CES 2013 ball when the startup announced its smartwatch would ship in late January. The following year its Pebble Steel model made several Best of CES lists including The Verges Best Smartwatch. Alas, the company is no more. Struggling under the weight of its debt, the company sold software assets to Fitbit Inc. last month. Pebble hardware projects are no more and it isnt actively supporting existing watches. Too bad for buyers wowed by their showing at CES.6) SmartwatchesAt CES 2014, a year after Pebbles debut, dozens of smartwatches were shown. Google unveiled its Android Wear smartwatch platform a few months later, and Apple announced its Watch in September of that year. The hope was that smartwatches would be the next hot gadget to rival the smartphone. But by the third quarter of 2016, global smartwatch sales were down 52% from a year earlier, according to research firm IDC.7) The Dell Venue 8 7000 tabletCalling it the thinnest tablet in the world, CES listed Dell Inc.s Venue 8 device among its 2015 Best of Innovation Award Honorees. It was part of an attempt by Intel Corp. to get its components into more tablets and other mobile devices. The tablet featured an Intel RealSense camera and Atom processor. However, last year Dell stopped selling the tablets. Intel managed to sneak a chip into some of the latest iPhones, but the semiconductor giant still hasnt cracked mobile.

State polls in India in five states in February and March are likely to send thousands of voters criss-crossing vast distances, boosting petrol demand throughout the first quarter of 2017, but analysts say growth could slow over the year as currency woes bite.ALSO READ | Card payments at petrol pumps: Govt nudges banks, oil firms to share costsHuge rallies by parties to showcase their political might among voters are a common sight before elections. Canvassing involves transportation of thousands of people from neighbouring areas to the rallies in trucks and buses.Indias refined fuel demand grew at 4.3% in December, its slowest pace in three months, but use of diesel-fired generator sets and vehicles by political parties for canvassing in state polls could result in higher demand this quarter.2016 fuel consumption was high, mainly due to petrol sales, rapid penetration of LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) in parts of the country and cheaper air travel due to low oil prices, said Tushar Tarun Bansal, a director at Singapore-based consultancy Ivy Global Energy.Petrol demand rose 12.2% in 2016 on top of strong growth in 2015, with diesel demand rising 5.6%, its fastest in four years, driven by a surge in domestic automobile sales.Cooking gas or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) sales rose 11.3% to 21.19 million tonnes.In early November, India scrapped the Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes as part of a crackdown on tax dodgers and counterfeiters but allowed the use of the banned currency for select purposes such as buying fuel for automobiles and cooking.ALSO READ | Hedge funds bet oil rally to extend into 2017 as output cuts hitIndias December fuel sales were dented by an end of that exemption, which was the main reason for a spike in local sales in November.

				In a notification on 29 July 2015, the ministry had directed RIL, which sells LPG cylinders under the Reliance Gas brand, to restrict its own marketing of domestically produced LPG to 10,000 tonnes per month.RIL has approached the ministry requesting them to remove the cap of 10,000 tonnes per month altogether, said the first person mentioned abovean official from an oil marketing company who declined to be identified.Although the ministry has not heeded RILs request so far, there are continuous follow-ups by the company, the person added.RIL did not respond to an email questionnaire sent on 27 December. As per the LPG Control Order on regulation of supply and distribution, issued by the petroleum ministry in 2000, all cooking gas produced domestically must be supplied to state-run oil marketing companiesBharat Petroleum Corp.

As per the ministrys order, RIL sells the LPG produced at its two refineries at Jamnagar, Gujarat, to public sector retailers. However, under a Parallel Marketing Scheme (PMS), private companies are allowed to import and market LPG to bulk consumers.In July 2016, RIL launched its small-capacity 5-kg cylinders, which qualify as free trade LPG (FTL). This means they are not subsidised by the government, unlike the commonly used 14.2-kg domestic cylinders. The larger capacity cylinders are sold at market price to consumers who have the option of receiving a government subsidy in their bank accounts. Private firms are not entitled to government subsidies, unlike state-run oil marketing companies, and have to sell fuel at market price.

226,0.2447,"London: Big Oil is poised to reap rewards this year as investments made before the crude price slump pay off just as recovery starts.
				   
				Seven of the worlds largest energy companies will together boost oil and natural gas output by 398,000 barrels a day, the most since 2010, according to data from Oslo-based consultant Rystad Energy AS. In 2018, output will rise even faster.The oil majors arent increasing their drilling budgets. Instead theyre benefiting from money invested before the rout. Lower costs combined with higher output would allow companies including Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc to maximize their gains from improved oil prices. Should crude remain above $50 a barrel, 2017 could be a break-out year, eliminating the need to borrow to pay dividends, according to analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein.They could hit a sweet spot this year, said Mark Tabrett, a London-based analyst at Bernstein. Heavy investments of previous years are paying off with more production, costs have been cut and the companies are in a position to take advantage of that when oil prices rise.After reaching an intraday low of $27.10 a barrel on  20 January, Brent oil prices more than doubled to a high of $57.89 on 12 December. The global benchmark rose 52% last year, its biggest yearly gain since 2009. Shares in the majors, meanwhile, rose across the board, led by Shell, whose B shares gained 53% in London, the best annual increase since at least 1990.Brent averaged about $45 a barrel in 2016, and is expected to rise above $55 this year, according to the median of 45 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Yet the majors, still smarting from more than two years of depressed prices, have expressed a reluctance to increase spending.For us this will be about not starting to run too fast, Statoil chief executive officer Eldar Saetre said at a conference in Oslo last week. There wont be a lot of new activity initiated when it comes to larger projects in 2017.2020 problemRystad estimates that the seven companies will boost output by about 670,000 barrels a day next year. Still, years of under-investment during the time when oil prices were low mean the production gains may be short lived.Output should start declining eventually for the majors that slowed project-sanctioning, said Rob West, an analyst at Redburn (Europe) Ltd, a London-based equity broker. Field-by-field models suggest thats a problem for 2020.Much of the expected increase is coming from offshore oil and gas projects approved at the start of the decade, said Espen Erlingsen, vice-president for analysis at Rystad. Theyre the kind of mammoth projects that are difficult to shut down once they get going.Included is Chevron Corp.s Gorgon liquefied natural gas project in Australia, which partly resumed operations last week, and Kazakhstans Kashagan field, in which Eni SpA, Exxon, Shell, and Total SA all have stakes, which began producing last year. Eni expects oil and gas production to climb to a record in 2017 even as spending continues to fall.A plan by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and 11 other nations to curb their supply and boost prices wont stand in the way of these companies growth plans, Redburns West said.While they all have production in Opec countries, the cuts are mostly concentrated outside of the majors portfolios, or cover assets that were declining anyway, he said.The majors are now starting to harvest from the investments they did at the beginning of this decade, Erlingsen said. Production is expected to grow, while investments are falling. Bloomberg",2017-01-11,USaR7mcuMq4D8T2c9vh7pL,"Seven of the worlds largest energy companies will together boost oil and natural gas output by 398,000 barrels a day, the most since 2010",10:37,Big oil hits sweet spot as new projects reap rewards of recovery
349,0.24935,"Bengaluru: Another quarter and another downward revision in growth. 
				   
				Infosys Ltd is expected by at least three brokerages to scale down its full-year dollar revenue growth for the third time this year when Indias second-largest software firm declares its third quarter results on Friday.This is not surprising, considering the negative cross currency impact and also partially, on account of managements inability to give a firm guidance. Still, 2015-16 is turning out to be roller-coaster ride for Infosys chief executive officer (CEO) Vishal Sikka. Till a year ago, Sikka seemed to have settled well and appeared to be enjoying his job (from playing cricket with employees in Mysuru to the after-results parties with senior management ranks).By December, Sikka came across as a different boss, unhappy with the progress made by the company, and heard telling his colleagues how he has been unable to implement things he had planned when he took over the current job in August 2014. In April last year, Infosys projected to grow at-best at 13.8%; now it will end the year in March with a less than 8% revenue expansion.Agreed, falling growth at Infosys mirrors the problems faced by the industry at-large: Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. scaled down its full-year growth on three times last year, and will grow at 9%. However, slow business from clients is just one area of concern. A bigger challenge is that, bit by bit, Infosys early turnaround plans put in place in January 2015, seem to be fizzling out. Retaining senior management is another headache for Sikka. Although overall attrition continues to be stable, five executive vice presidents (EVPs) left Infosys last year, compared to three EVP departures in the first 17 months of Sikkas tenure (1 August 201431 December 2015).Also read: Five things to watch for in TCS Q3 results tomorrowSikkas record to make the company future-ready, by having $2 billion from newer technologies and platforms, and another $1.5 billion from mergers and acquisitions and finally by improving its revenue per employee to $80,000 by March 2021, is patchy at best. This is not to pooh-pooh Sikkas efforts; he has tried his best till now. But Sikkas best seems to have not made a dent in an insular organisation like Infosys. How can Infosys embrace the new technologies if it shies away from acquisitions (Infosys has not made a single acquisition in the last 15 months)? During this time, Wipro Ltd spent over a $1 billion in buying companies. Most worrying is that despite Sikkaa repeated missives to employee to shape-up and embrace automation platforms in projects and learn newer skill sets, Infosyss revenue per employee refuses to improve. Finally, assuaging investor concerns, many of whom are now getting jumpy over some of the founders reported unhappiness with the CEO, is a big challenge. Despite Infosys estimated to grow faster than Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) in the current year, Infosys shares were down 8.4% as against a 7.7% decline in IT index last year. Infosys shareholders increased their wealth by 32.3% (as against a 14.21% return made in IT Index) in the period between 1 August 2014 and 31 December 2015.With this as the backdrop, Mint brings to you five things to watch out for when Infosys declares its earnings on Friday:Revenue forecast: Brokerage BNP Paribas sees Infosys recording a 1.5% sequential decline in dollar revenue (declining 0.5% in constant currency terms) at $2.55 billion for the October-December period. Management is further expected to narrow its full-year dollar revenue growth to less than 8%. This could set alarm bells ringing for investors as this suggests that Sikkas new measures to turnaround the company are taking longer than earlier expected.Senior management exits and steps management is taking to arrest attrition: A bigger headache for Sikka in this financial year is turning out to be the departure among senior management ranks. Exits of senior employees is leading to poor execution, a reason Sikka has conceded in the past behind companys underperformance.Where is the new in old Infosys? To Sikkas credit, Infosys over the last few years has hired people in the areas of artificial intelligence and pushed to embrace automation platforms. But the proof of the pudding is if indeed Infosys has been able to deploy some of these technologies to either improve its profitability or win business from newer companies which are acting as agents of disruption. Has Infosys won any business from companies like Uber or Airbnb or Facebook? It is over two years since Infosys first detailed its ambition of becoming a $20 billion firm by March 2021, and yet the management shies away from disclosing the progress made from monetising platforms.What is the challenge in translating business from large deal wins? Infosys under Sikka has significantly improved its large deal wins in a quarter ($809 million in April-June period and over $1 billion in the July-September period). For some unexplainable reason, this improved deal win is not translating into growth. Management clarity on this theme will be important.Infosys Consulting, BPO and Edgeverve continue to remain weak: Since August 2014, EdgeVerve and Infosys BPO units continue to underperform. Together, both accounted for a little over 13% of its $9.5 billion revenue last year. Infosys consulting was the third weak area at the beginning of this financial year. All three units now have new leaders, and any significant growth for Infosys can come only if there is growth in at-least one of these units.",2017-01-11,mrkAslcCJ8FdoxbvnSQ9GP,"Time is running out, and amid falling growth, its time Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka starts delivering on his new strategy as investors patience runs thin",09:47,Infosys Q3 results today: Five things to watch out for
73,-0.2486,"London/ Singapore: Oil prices rose for the first time in three days on Wednesday, following news of Saudi supply cuts to Asia, but persistent doubt over output reductions and signs of rising shipments from other producers kept gains in check.
				   
				Brent crude futures were up 41 cents at $54.05 a barrel by 5.03pm, while US West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up 39 cents at $51.21 a barrel.Brent has surrendered nearly 40% of the gains made between late November and early January. Analysts, however, said the slide was unlikely to become more aggressive, given the likelihood of Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbours at least sticking to their pledge to cut output. Few envision that Brent crude at sub-$50 a barrel is a viable price (in the first half of 2017) amid Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) production cuts tightening up the market, SEB commodities strategist Bjarne Schieldrop said.Whether last nights low of $53.58/barrel turns out to be the low point remains to be seen. However, we do think that buying in the territory between the current price of $53.88/b and down to $50/b is probably as good as it gets for buyers in H1.Saudi Arabia, the worlds top oil exporter, has told some of its Asian customers that it will reduce their crude supplies slightly in February. But there is still plenty of oil to fill the gaps left by the Opec. North American drilling is on the rise, while European and Chinese traders are shipping a record 22 million barrels of crude from the North Sea and Azerbaijan to Asia this month. There is still doubt among many market watchers over whether the planned cuts will be enough to rebalance a market that has been oversupplied for the past two years.Traders continued to fret about rising US supply and compliance by Opec to agreed-upon production cuts, ANZ bank said.The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Tuesday that crude production in the United States this year would rise by 110,000 barrels per day to 9 million bpd.Another concern is high US crude stockpiles, with the EIA scheduled to release its latest figures on Wednesday. Opecs second-biggest producer Iraq plans to raise crude exports from its southern port of Basra to an all-time high of 3.641 million bpd in February, keeping shipments high even as Opec production cuts take effect this month.

246,0.22055,"Dubai/Singapore: Saudi Arabia has cut February term crude supplies to refiners in India and Southeast Asia, seeking to comply with an Opec deal, but it has held most of its exports to the rest of Asia steady for a second month, industry sources said on Wednesday.
				   
				State oil giant Saudi Aramco reduced February term supplies of mainly heavy crude to Indian refiners Reliance Industries and Hindustan Mittal Energy Ltd (HMEL), as well as to Malaysias Petronas, four sources familiar with the matter said.Aramco has also cut oil supplies to another southeast Asian buyer for a second month in February, one of the sources said.That means some major oil companies in Europe and the United States could see reductions of up to 18% in their term volumes for February, the source said.Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are focusing their cuts on US and European customers as they target excess inventories and protect market share in Asia, Energy Aspects analyst Virendra Chauhan said.Saudi Aramco and the other companies could not be reached for comment. Details on the amounts of the supply reductions could not be confirmed.Saudis February supply reductions to a handful of Asian refiners mark the start of cuts to a region left untouched in January at the onset of the Opec output deal.The producer maintained strong exports to Asia in January to protect its market share there and because it gets higher netbacks on sales to the East than it does for other regions.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) agreed to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017 to reduce a global supply glut and support prices.Worlds top exporter Saudi Arabia cut oil output in January by at least 486,000 bpd to 10.058 million bpd.Still, Saudi Aramco kept February supplies to most North Asian refiners at full volumes for a second month, trade sources said, indicating it will have to continue cutting exports to Europe and the United States to meet its Opec commitment.I think the Saudis wont touch volumes to Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.

365,0.2464,"New Delhi: Indias biggest fuel retailer is seeking to buy oil assets as demand surges in the worlds fastest growing energy market.
				   
				State-run Indian Oil Corp. wants to buy assets globally to ensure a tenth of its refining capacity is fed by crude that is either from its own oil field or from assets where it has a stake, Chairman B. Ashok said in an interview on Monday. That goal will require the company to boost oil production 10-fold to about 210,000 barrels a day in the next eight years. There is a lot of potential production from our existing blocks, Ashok said in his office in New Delhi, referring to the blocks it holds in Africa, Latin America and the US. We are also looking at economics and seeing where the assets are available.Indian Oil, the nations biggest company by sales, and other state companies are increasing global acquisitions to secure energy supplies and meet demand thats expected to double by 2040. The biggest oil sector downturn in a generation opened a window for the energy hungry Indian companies to snap up assets as oilfield operators looked to sell assets or take partners to share expenses.Diversifying geographiesThis is a good time for Indian companies to buy oil assets overseas, said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at InterfaxEnergys Global Gas Analytics in London. There could be potential interest in the Middle East and Africa, and opportunities in Latin American nations such as Brazil and Mexico as they seek foreign partnerships to boost output.China had similarly stepped up overseas oil and gas investments after the 2008 oil price crash, snapping up assets for $108 billion in the five years to 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Indias oil companies spent almost $6 billion buying stakes in Russian oil fields last year. Indian Oil is diversifying its search to other geographies and is evaluating offers from global oil companies that are looking to sell some of their assets to generate cash, Ashok said. He did not give details.There are lot of opportunities possibly on offer in Africa, Middle-East and South East Asia, he said. We are looking at these and if the prices are right, we will go for it.The companys shares, which have risen 55% in the past year, added 1.2% to Rs346.8 in Mumbai on Tuesday.Refinery expansionApart from oil production, the company also plans to increase refining capacity. It is building one of countrys biggest refinery-cum-petrochemicals complex on the western coast along with two other state-run oil companies. It will own 50% in the proposed project and is keen to bring in a foreign partner, Ashok said.Indian Oil plans to spend about Rs1.8 trillion ($26.2 billion) through 2022 to expand it refining capacity to over 100 million tons and build new pipeline and distribution infrastructure. The company currently processes 80.7 million tons of crude a year from its nine plants and two owned by its unit Chennai Petroleum Corp. Indias oil demand is forecast to reach 10.3 million barrels per day by 2040, according to Paris-based International Energy Agency.The countrys 23 refineries have a total capacity of about 230 million tons a year, while total fuel demand was 196.5 million tons during 2016, according to the oil ministry.

255,0.23415,"Oil companies are likely to report a decent set of numbers for the December quarter. Singapore gross refining margin (GRM), though lower on a year-on-year basis, has improved sequentially (see chart). Nevertheless, a better refining environment is expected to reflect in the December quarter numbers of Indian refining companies. GRM is a measure of the difference between the per barrel price of crude oil and the value of products distilled from it.
				   
				State-run oil marketing companies (OMCs)Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Indian Oil Corp. Ltdare expected to report a good quarter thanks to a recovery in GRMs and inventory gains. While we assume inventory gains (GRM $1-2 a barrel, marketing segment $1-1.5 a barrel), we think OMCs could surprise, pointed out Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd. OMC stocks have outperformed the BSE Sensex so far this fiscal year. Currently, they trade in the range of about 9-12 times estimated earnings for FY17.For Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), improvement in refining margins is expected to be set off to an extent against muted performance from its petrochemicals business. Analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd expect RILs earnings to be largely flat versus the September quarter. That is because, according to Jefferies, the companys GRM is likely to improve by a more modest $0.7 a barrel to $10.8 a barrel in the December quarter due to a five-week maintenance shutdown at one of its FCC (fluid catalytic cracking) units and sharper improvement in gasoline and fuel oil cracks relative to middle distillate cracks. Middle distillate products account for a relatively higher share of RILs product slate.Secondly, the companys blended petrochemical margin has been slightly lower last quarter. Further, the impact of currency demonetization needs to be watched on the petrochemicals segment. Management commentary on the telecom business and updates on downstream projects will be crucial for the RIL stock, which has underperformed the benchmark Sensex so far this fiscal year.Meanwhile, earnings of upstream oil companiesOil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd and Oil India Ltdare expected to benefit from the strength in crude oil prices. On the flip side, some of those gains are likely to be offset by the 18% cut in domestic gas price. Shares of both companies have fared well this year but the outlook seems tough.

190,-0.196125,"Washington/London:  US prosecutors charged three ex-traders at the heart of a criminal investigation that has ensnared the worlds biggest banks over the rigging of currency rates.
				   
				Richard Usher, formerly of JPMorgan Chase & Co., Rohan Ramchandani, who used to work for Citigroup Inc., and Chris Ashton, a former Barclays Plc trader, were indicted Tuesday on conspiracy charges in New York. Theyre all living in the UK and will have to be extradited unless they surrender voluntarily.The three men used an online chatroom they dubbed The Cartel to coordinate trading of US dollars and euros and manipulate prices of the currencies, according to the indictment. They are charged with conspiring to restrain trade from the end of 2007 through the beginning of 2013. The goal of the conspiracy was to suppress and eliminate competition in the trading of the euro and the dollar in the US, UK and Switzerland, according to the charges.The case represents the culmination of the governments promise to prosecute individuals at the center of one of the biggest market-manipulation investigations of the Obama administration. The indictments come after years of criticism against the Justice Department for securing multibillion-dollar corporate penalties without holding individuals to account.ALSO READ: SoftBank hires UK investor Akshay Naheta to help manage $100 billion fundNo one gets a free pass simply because they were working for a corporation, said deputy attorney general Sally Yates, the departments No. 2 official. Todays indictment reiterates our commitment to holding individuals accountable for corporate misconduct.Lawyers fire backLawyers for the traders criticized the US for moving forward with its case after UK authorities looked at the same evidence and decided not to bring charges. Stephen Pollard, Ramchandanis lawyer, said the UKs Serious Fraud Office already investigated his client for more than 18 months.It is unacceptable for the American DOJ to bypass the SFO decision and seek to prosecute conduct undertaken on British soil by British citizens where the British regulators have confirmed there was no criminal offence, said Pollard, an attorney with WilmerHale in London.Ushers lawyer, Jonathan Pickworth, a partner at White & Case in London, said he was disappointed and that Usher did nothing wrong. Ashtons lawyer Sara George, a partner at Stephenson Harwood LLP, said her client was also cleared by the UK authorities and was never given any legal advice, guidance or instruction by Barclays in relation to US law.ALSO READ: Ola names former SAB Miller executive Shalabh Seth as leasing subsidiary CEOThe charges carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine, although that figure may be increased depending on the gains from the misconduct.

The OCC also banned both of them from working in the US banking industry.Bank pleasCitigroup, Barclays, JPMorgan and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc pleaded guilty in May 2015 to conspiring to rig currency rates. UBS Group AG received immunity from prosecution, but its conduct in the market breached an earlier agreement over its role in manipulating benchmark interest rates.The Cartel chatroom was limited to specific euro-dollar traders, prosecutors said. Many conversations took place just before daily fixesthe brief windows of time when data providers take a snapshot of trading so they can set daily rates. Usher and Ramchandani started conspiring in December 2007, while Ashton got involved four years later, according to the indictment.The three former traders participated in telephone calls and electronic messages, including engaging in near-daily conversations in the chat room, which they also referred to as The Mafia, where they discussed past, current and future customer orders and trades, prosecutors alleged.The CartelThe Cartel chat room was started by Usher as early as 2009, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Usher had risen quickly to the top of his profession. After joining HBOS Plc in 2001, he was hired by RBS in 2003 and a year later collected an industry award on his employers behalf. He joined JPMorgan as head of spot foreign exchange in 2010, where he became a member of the now-defunct Bank of Englands Chief Dealers Sub Group, a collection of about a dozen currency traders and central bank officials who met at restaurants and bank offices to discuss industry developments.The members of the chat room ribbed each other like high-school buddies. Usher was referred to as Feston because he resembled an overweight version of British chef Heston Blumenthal, according to people who have seen the chats. Ramchandani, Citigroups cricket-loving head of spot trading, was called Ruggy, while Ashton, the last one to join, was dubbed Robocop.The US investigation followed a series of articles published by Bloomberg in 2013 exposing how the worlds biggest banks were colluding to rig foreign exchange rates.

433,0.245325,"Bengaluru: At Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), the protracted period of subpar growth continued as Indias largest technology outsourcing firm reported a 0.3% dollar revenue growth, marginally higher than Street expectations, in the October-December period.
				   
				TCS, which ended with $16.5 billion in revenue last year, has grown more than 3% on a sequential basis in a quarter only three times since October 2014. Worryingly, over these past nine quarters, it last reported an over 10% year-on-year growth only once, in the January-March 2015 period.Mumbai-based TCS saw a 0.3% rise in dollar revenue from the preceding three months, and was up 5.8% from the year-ago period to $4.379 billion in the quarter to December. In rupee terms, third-quarter revenue rose 1.5% to Rs29,735 crore from the preceding three months. In constant currency terms, TCS reported a 2% growth, on account of generating more business from its banking clients in the US.TCSs quarterly profit rose 1.6% sequentially to $1 billion, up 8% from $926 million in the year-ago period.A Bloomberg survey of analysts had estimated the firm to report Rs6,432 crore ($947.49 million) profit on net sales of 29610.5 crore ($4.36 billion).The companys operating margin was 26%, similar to what it was at the end of the July-September period. The management reiterated its commitment to end the year in its stated guidance of 26-28% operating margin.It was a very good quarter, considering traditionally Q3 has a weak demand, said Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chief executive officer, TCS, who is set to take over as chairman of holding company Tata Sons on 21 February. I dont expect Q4 to be anything different than in the past. As of now, based on what information I have, I believe it (Q4) should be on expected lines.Chandrasekaran downplayed concerns over a clamp down on H-1B visas, critical to software firms such as TCS, in the context of the new administration in the US and said the company is well prepared to cope with any increase in wages for its US employees or a lowering of the visa ceiling.I cannot comment on the margin impact; but since 2015, we have been preparing ourselves to work in a visa-constrained environment. So I dont think there will be any impact on us, said Chandrasekaran. Earlier this month, a legislation demanding that outsourcing firms pay at least $100,000 a year to employees who work in the US was introduced in the US Congress.TCS does not give a quarterly or yearly guidance, and the companys underperformance in the nine months of the current year means it will at-best report a 6% dollar revenue growth, lower than the 7.1% growth reported last year.TCS has added $786 million in incremental revenue from April to December this year against $783 million in new business in the first nine months of 2015-16. Significantly, for the first time since TCS went public in 2004, its annual growth will be less than or at best on par with Accenture Plc., which is double the size of the Mumbai-based firm. Accenture grew 6% in the year to August last year (Accenture follows September-August as financial year), helped by  15 acquisitions , which brought 2 percentage points of overall 10.5% constant currency growth. TCS has shied away from buying companies.It is status quonothing materially different than the second quarter. It is important to note that expectations are already so low that even if the company meets the low end of these expectations, it is considered to be a decent show, said a Mumbai-based analyst at a domestic brokerage, on condition of anonymity.At the heart of TCSs underperformance is its inability to build a stronger consulting practice and the managements reluctance to buy small hi-tech firms. TCS also faces some client-specific challenges. Nonetheless, TCS said its digital business in the third quarter rose 6.6% on a sequential basis and 30.2% over the year-ago period to $737 million, or 16.8% of its quarterly revenue.Its revenue from banking, financial services and insurance firms, which accounts for 40% of total revenue, reported a 2.1% increase in constant currency terms. TCS reported a 2.2% improvement in the US, which accounts for 55% of total revenue. Revenue growth in the UK, which brings about 13.3% of total business, rose 1.7%, while the India business, which brings about 6.3% of revenue, jumped 10.3%.TCS managed to retain more employees in the quarter, as attrition for IT services stood at 11.3% and including back office unit (BPO business), attrition was 12.2%.

Ltd (ONGC) seems headed for a protracted battle. The oil ministry has asked for views from Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), the law ministry and in-house legal experts on whether it should proceed to recover the $1.55 billion compensation demanded from RIL while an arbitration remains pending.
				   
				The oil ministry has also sought their views on the measures that could be taken to ensure that production of gas does not decline further from RILs KG D6 block so that any move to recover the compensation from the sales revenue of gas from the KG DWN 98/3 (KG D6) block does not suffer, a person with direct knowledge of the development said on condition of anonymity. RIL reported production of 139.1 billion cubic feet of gas from the block in 2015-16.An email sent to RIL on Tuesday remained unanswered at the time of going to press.The person quoted above said that the government was merely addressing all aspects of the dispute as per the law and was not being vengeful to an investor. We are only taking steps to protect governments revenue interest in an objective manner as any government of the day will do in any given dispute. The provisions of the law will take its course, said the person.After the oil ministry raised the compensation claim on 4 November, Reliance proposed an arbitration to resolve the issue. Accordingly, the government nominated G.S. Singhvi, a former Supreme Court judge and former Competition Appellate Tribunal (Compat) chairman, as its arbitrator, Mint reported on 26 December. Singhvi, along with RILs nominee on the arbitration panel, Bernard Eder, a former high court judge in the UK, are now in the process of finalizing a third neutral umpire arbitrator for the panel.The ministry raised the compensation demand after the Justice A.P. Shah panel, which looked into ONGCs claim of gas flow between the neighbouring fields of the two companies, recommended on 31 August that RIL should compensate for the unfair enrichment it had by way of retaining the gains of gas flow into its block KG D6. The panel was appointed after the Delhi high court, on a petition from ONGC, asked the government to resolve the issue in a transparent way, keeping in mind provisions of the law and applying principles of natural justice.The panel, which lacked technical expertise on determining whether gas flowed from ONGCs block to RILs, relied upon a report by consultant DeGolyer and MacNaughton, jointly hired by the companies, to say that between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2015, about 11 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas migrated to KG D6 from adjacent fields, of which RIL benefited from 8.9 bcm. RIL in a 4 November statement said that its liability to pay compensation had not been established by any process known to law. The claim of the government is based on misreading and misinterpretation of key elements of the production sharing contract and is without precedent in the oil and gas industry, anywhere in the world RIL remains convinced of being able to fully justify and vindicate its position that the governments claim is not sustainable, the company had said then. Experts said disputes often arise on account of volatility in the energy sector as well as from multiple interpretations of the contract.The government has to ensure that investors get a reasonable return on their investments in the oil and gas sector compared to what they would get from other markets or from other industries.

The system relies on unique security keys that are traded and verified between users to guarantee communications are secure and cannot be intercepted by a middleman, the report said.But WhatsApp can force the generation of new encryption keys for offline users unbeknown to the sender and recipient of the messages, it said.Tobias Boelter, a cryptography researcher at the University of California told the Guardian: If WhatsApp is asked by a government agency to disclose its messaging records, it can effectively grant access due to the change in keys.ALSO READ: Google drops dream of drones providing InternetBoelter said he had reported the backdoor vulnerability to Facebook in April 2016 and was told that Facebook was already aware of the issue but that it was not actively being worked on.

				The lender had reported a post-tax profit of Rs41 crore in the year-ago period. Its net interest income rose 31% to Rs209 crore, while the non-interest income was up Rs36 crore to Rs64 crore during the quarter. The share of low-cost current and savings account balances increased to 25.85% as on 31 December, from the 21.91% three months ago, on the back of a surge in deposits following the governments demonetisation move. The surge in deposits, coupled with a massive slowdown in advances (which grew only 2% sequentially) led to a drop in the credit-deposit ratio to 77.41% from 83.33% in the year-ago period. The banks net interest margin was down 3.95% as against 3.96% in the year-ago period, primarily due to pressure on yield on advances, managing director and chief executive Murali Natrajan said. He added the bank is confident of sustaining the number but may not bother much if it dips to up to 3.70%.A sale to an Asset Reconstruction Company(ARC) helped improve the gross non-performing assets ratio to 1.55% from the 1.98% in the year-ago period.

102,0.246975,"Deals in the infrastructure space are set to increase as companies put dozens of assets across roads and renewable energy sectors on sale, according to analysts and investment bankers. A number of such deals have either been announced or are in the due-diligence stage and will likely be completed in 2017. 
				   
				A number of infrastructure-focused funds and overseas pension funds have announced plans to invest in Indias roads and renewable energy projects.  Within infrastructure, roads is a sector where one will see deal activity improving, primarily because there are multiple operating assets available for a transaction that do not have construction risks involved and thus have better appeal to a financial investor. Also, there are multiple buying platforms emerging apart from the existing road platforms, as financial investors will also become acquirers of road assets via structures such as InvITs (infrastructure investment trusts). It is now a question of buyers and sellers expectations meeting at a certain valuation benchmark, said Navneet Singh, executive director and head, infrastructure group, Avendus Capital. ALSO READ: Indias solar prices set to drop amid competition, lower costsAlso, while deals in the thermal energy sector are expected to remain subdued due to the presence of only a handful of buyers, predominantly looking for operating assets, the renewable sector, primarily solar, will see activity in fund-raising as companies will continue to need additional capital to build their projects, Singh added. Several Indian infrastructure developers, weighed down by debt, have announced exits from individual highway projects to monetize assets and repay creditors while renewable energy firms evaluate fund-raises and going public.The infrastructure sector raised about $3.78 billion in 2016 across 36 transactions, including mergers and acquisitions (M&A), private equity (PE) investment and two initial public offerings (IPOs), analysis of monthly data from investment bank Equirus Capital Pvt. Ltd showed. This compares with $2.9 billion raised in 2014 and about $3.7 billion raised in 2015. According to data from Grant Thornton India, about $2.91 billion was raised from 39 M&A and PE transactions in 2016 across engineering, infrastructure, and clean-tech sectors.Funds such as US-based I Squared Capital, Indian asset manager IDFC Alternatives infrastructure fund, Canadas Brookfield Asset Management, Australias Macquarie Group, and the Canadian pension funds Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec (CDPQ) have committed large investments in the sector and are looking to buy assets across roads, thermal power and renewable energy to build their own portfolio in India. CDPQ, for example, had last year committed investments of $150 million for renewable energy in India and also joined hands with Tata Power Co. Ltd and ICICI Venture to launch a platform to facilitate investments in power projects with an initial capital of up to $850 million. Infrastructure Fund II of multi-asset manager IDFC Alternatives, for example, plans to buy certain operational road assets by March. A number of deals in the sector have been signed or announced over the last 12 months but many are yet to close. One noticeable trend seen is that closing and funding control acquisitions require significantly higher involvement and patience than buying simple passive minority stakes, said Aditya Aggarwal, partner (infrastructure) at IDFC Alternatives. Going forward, I would expect a lot more mid-sized M&A activity in renewables given that significant solar capacity would get commissioned from the equity lock-in restrictions in 2017. Likewise, I expect the TOT (toll-operate-transfer) model to be a game changer in road sector investments this year, Aggarwal said. The government is looking to monetize 75 national highways operated by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) through international competitive bidding under the so-called TOT model, where investors including foreign funds will participate. ALSO READ: Centre calls national review meet to push clean energy projectsSimilarly, road developers including Sadbhav Infrastructure Projects Ltd and Gayatri Projects Ltd are looking for buyers for some of their operational assets. Hyderabad-based Gayatri Projects is carrying out the process of demerging its roads assets into a separate entity to bring in a financial partner or look at selling the portfolio either entirely or as individual assets to foreign funds, managing director T.V. Sandeep Kumar Reddy said.

In the year-ago quarter, the company reported a profit of Rs7,218 crore on revenue of Rs56,567 crore. RIL will announce its third-quarter earnings on Monday. At 9.15am, RIL was trading at Rs1,091.40 on BSE, up 0.11% from previous close while Indias benchmark Sensex Index rose 0.01% to 27,238.35 points.We expect this to be the eighth consecutive sequential earnings increase. Strong refining should more than offset the likely weaker pet-chem segment (weaker margins, and likely impact of demonetization), Nomura Research said in a 5 January note to clients. Analysts expect RILs gross refining margin (GRM) to be between $10.5 per barrel and $11.5 per barrel. GRM is the realization from turning every barrel of crude oil into finished products. Reliances GRM is likely to improve by a more modest $0.7 per barrel to $10.8 per barrel in third quarter due to a five-week maintenance shutdown in one of its fluid catalytic cracking units and sharper improvement in gasoline and fuel oil cracks relative to middle distillate cracks, brokerage Jefferies India said in a 4 January note. During the quarter, benchmark Singapore complex margins increased by $1.5 per barrel sequentially to $6.7 per barrel. RILs petrochemical business is estimated to report a drop in EBIT on overall weaker margins, planned shutdown and impact of demonetization. EBIT stands for earnings before interest and taxes and is an indication of a companys profitability. Petchem will be impacted by demonetization and lower spreads. Consequently, we estimate EBITDA to dip 6% quarter-on-quarter, Edelweiss Securities said in a 6 January note. During the December quarter, RIL commissioned the first phase of its paraxylene capacity.

324,0.248075,"Bangalore/Mumbai: Amid the carnage on Wall Street in 2008, as Bank of America Corp. was trying to forge its rushed merger with Merrill Lynch & Co., Natarajan Chandrasekaran boarded a plane for New York to try to reassure the two financial behemoths that an Indian IT company could make the systems of their strikingly different cultures work together.
				   
				Chandrasekaran, known as Chandra, was then chief operating officer of Asias largest IT services exporter, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS). Over the following weeks he fended off global rivals who smelled an opportunity to muscle in, and set about integrating the banks systems and assuaging the new managements anxieties about outsourcing to a foreign supplier. TCS kept the business and grew it substantially.Last week, Chandra, now chief executive officer of TCS, was chosen for an even more fraught diplomatic task: to resurrect the image and fortunes of the Tata Group, Indias biggest conglomerate, which has been racked by losses at some of its biggest units, and by a boardroom battle that has threatened to turn the workings of the venerable corporation into a media soap-opera.Tata Sons, the group holding company, named Chandra, 53, as chairman, taking over on 21 February from interim chairman Ratan Tata. Tata, 79, had run the family business for more than two decades before handing over in 2012 to his hand-picked successor, Cyrus Mistry. In October, Tata Sons shocked Indias corporate community by firing Mistry, reinstalling Ratan Tata and promising to find a replacement by March. Chandra was a front runner for the job, a Tata employee almost all his working life, who grew TCS into the conglomerates most successful business, with about $16 billion in sales.Yet he is both an insider and an outsider. While he has been with the group since joining as an intern three decades ago, he is the first chairman who is not a Parsi, the shrinking ethnic group of Zoroastrians that boasts a disproportionately high number of Indias business elite. He is only the third person without the Tata name to get the job, and the first without a close family tie to the Tatas.IT CareerMoreover, his career and success has all been with TCS, virtually an island within the group that serves many of the worlds top corporations with a young, skilled, technical workforce. As head of Tata Sons, he will be responsible for a conglomerate that assembles buses in Zambia, serves prawn kalimiri to diners at its Bombay Brasserie in London, sells salt to Indian families at Rs18(27 cents) a kilo, and runs hundreds of other businesses across the world.He served both TCS and the customer commendably during the BofA-ML merger. Now he has the chance to build a positive organization by bonding together various companies and their half-a-million plus employees, said S. Ramadorai, the previous CEO of TCS. He is non-confrontational and, at the same time, does not foolishly ignore problems.Chandras appointment came after TCS announced it had made the equivalent of $1 billion in quarterly profit for the first time. Tatas star unit accounts for over half of the groups market value.A five-man panel unanimously chose Chandra from a list of more than a dozen candidates. He stood out both within the group and outside, said former bureaucrat Vijay Singh, a non-executive director on the board of Tata Sons, which ratified the selection. A Tata Sons statement said Chandra would uphold the groups values and adhere to its high standard of practicesthings the board previously accused Mistry of failing to do.We are at an inflection point, said Chandra in a statement after his appointment. I am aware that this role comes with huge responsibilities. It will be my endeavor to help progress the group with the ethos, ethics and values that the Tata group has been built on. Chandra declined an interview request for this story.Steel lossesFacing him is a menu of corporate issues, including the money-losing UK operations of Tata Steel Ltd., the overhang from failed ambitions like Tata Motors Ltd.s cheap Nano car, debt-ridden Indian Hotels Co., and a $1.17 billion arbitration battle with telecom partner NTT Docomo Inc. Mistry has previously defended his time as chairman, when he tried to reduce debt built up during a series of global acquisitions by Ratan Tata. In an e-mail to directors after his dismissal, Mistry said the group may face Rs1.18 trillion in writedowns over time because of  legacy hotspots he inherited.Mistry, whose family owns an 18% stake in Tata Sons, filed a case with the National Company Law Tribunal seeking the appointment of an administrator to oversee the companys affairs, a forensic audit and a probe into the role of the trustees of Tata trusts, the majority shareholders of Tata Sons. Hes asked for Ratan Tata, head of the trusts, to be restrained from attending board meetings. A spokesman for Mistry said he would not comment as the matter is subject to the legal proceedings.Investors expect Chandra to act quickly to resolve governance issues, said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director at proxy advisory firm InGovern Research Services Pvt. Key to his success will be how he handles Ratan Tata, who has indicated that he may step down as chairman of the trusts this year. Tata instigated the Nano project, a troubled airline venture and many of the other expansions that are now draining the groups resources.Tata congratulated Chandra on Twitter, saying he was sure the new chairman would protect the groups values and ethics. A Tata Group spokesman declined to comment.Chandra is an optimist, he thinks big and will go after positive outcomes in the new job, said Krishnakumar N., executive chairman of rival Indian IT services company Mindtree Ltd.The son of a farmer in rural southern India, Chandra studied in a Tamil-language school rather than gaining the English-language education favored by the middle class.He joined TCS in 1987 after completing a masters in Computer Applications from Regional Engineering College, Trichy, Tamil Nadu. His leadership talent was spotted by Ramadorai in 1993 when Chandra was praised by customer International Business Machines Corp. He was put in charge of a major project for British Telecommunications Plc. When Ramadorai became TCSs CEO, he chose Chandra as his executive assistant.He loved meeting customers, and it was never a Hi-How-Are-You? kind of a meeting, Ramadorai said in a telephone interview. He put the client at the center of the universe, made every conversation count and nurtured clients like American Express.Young CEOChandra took over as chief executive of TCS in 2009 at the age of 46. Over the next seven years, he would triple the IT companys share price and revenue and more than double its headcount.As Chandras corporate universe expanded, so did his interests, according to colleagues. Hes fond of photography and classical music, but his real passion is running. He has run marathons in Boston, Chicago, Berlin, New York, Tokyo and other cities.Being a runner has greatly shaped my thinking as a leader, Chandra told Runners World in October 2015. You have to decide on the length of the engagement, develop endurance to handle setbacks and increase speed when the competition demands it. You have to perform with your heart and your mind.At TCS, Chandra backed new technologies from cloud to mobile and evangelized to global corporations about digital disruption, always with a reputation for building close relationships with clients. Som Mittal, former head of Hewlett-Packard Co.s India operations, worked with Chandra for years in the software-industry trade body Nasscom and said if he texted Chandra, hed get a call back within 20 minutes.Whether he was preparing for a marathon in London or stepping into a client meeting in New York, he unfailingly called back, no matter what timezone and which corner of the globe he was in, said Mittal. He was also an inveterate traveler who would fly to client meetings even for the smallest deals. He has this uncanny ability of making everyone think they are his dearest friends.Chandra drove projects at TCS that dispersed the chaotic crowds and touts that used to clog the entrances of Indias passport offices and its best-known hospital, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi. He charted new territories for TCS in Latin America and Japan by hiring local talent.His new role comes with a different set of challenges. He will have to stabilize the group and plan a decade or two into the groups future, said Ramadorai. It is a rough road.Looming over him will be the presence of a family that has been royalty in Indias business world for more than a century, and the scion of that family, Ratan Tata.Chandra is not afraid to express opinion and can be extremely firm when he is convinced about something, said Mittal. He is no pushover. Bloomberg",2017-01-16,icSPfNFcGFeEX4LWRyqbnM,Natarajan Chandrasekaran  will take over as chairman of Tata Sons from interim chief Ratan Tata on 21 February ,12:30,N.

				Were a US-based company that operates worldwide and our predominant employment is in the United States, Nadella said on Trump pressing the business world to boost activities on American soil.Weve already created a tremendous amount of high-paying jobs in the US, he told CNNTech at the DLD tech conference in Munich on Monday. Microsoft employs more than 1,13,000 people worldwide, more than 64,000 of whom are in the United States, mainly in Washington state, according to the company. In the wake of Trumps win, companies are eager to play up the number of Americans they employ, the CNNTech said. Companies like Amazon have made public announcements about the jobs they expect to add, with messaging that seems to be in direct response to Trumps win. Amazon recently announced that it plans to create more than 100,000 new full-time jobs in the US in the next 18 months, bringing its total workforce in the country to 280,000.However, Nadella is confident about Microsofts place as a job creator and said Trumps ascent has not changed the roadmap much for Microsoft.  If anything, well double down on what weve always done, which is be a US company that operates in the United States very responsibly, but also being a multinational company that contributes into every country that we work in, he said.

357,0.247775,"Seoul: The long-orchestrated plan to cement Jay Y. Lees position atop Samsung Group may put him in jail instead, raising questions about who would step in to run South Koreas biggest conglomerate in the aftermath.
				   
				Prosecutors are seeking Lees arrest on allegations including bribery and embezzlement, which if proven could prompt him to relinquish duties at the family business. Potential replacements include executives running key divisions of the dominant electronics business, as well as a sisterhotel executive Lee Boo-jin. While a long shot, her anointment would mark a seismic shift in the way the nations patriarchal empires are run.After spending years following his fathers footsteps to the chairmans seat of Samsung Group, Lee is trying now to avoid the missteps that triggered his fathers two criminal convictions. Even if the accusations against him involving South Koreas president are proven in court, its still possible Lee could return to the company later or even call the shots from behind bars, just as executives from Hyundai Motor Co. and SK Group have done.Chaebol executives have a history of managing from the jail, whether it be via lawyers or secretaries visiting them, said Lee Kyung-mook, a professor at Seoul National Universitys Graduate School of Business.Samsung declined to comment when asked about a potential leadership vacuum. A court hearing is scheduled for Wednesday to determine whether to approve the prosecutors request for an arrest warrant. Whether the warrant is granted or not, prosecutors would continue their probe with a possible indictment coming later.Lees potential arrest in the scandal surrounding President Park Geun-hye is another calamity for the vice chairman of Samsung Electronics Co., the largest maker of mobile devices. Last year, the company pulled its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone off the shelves because some devices burst into flames. The debacle cost Suwon-based Samsung an estimated $6 billion and a competitive advantage before Apple Inc. released its iPhone 7 models.Lee, 48, has had trouble matching the success of his father, Lee Kun-hee, who transformed Samsung Electronics from a copycat appliance maker into a global powerhouse in TVs, smartphones and memory chips. The elder LeeSouth Koreas richest mansuffered a crippling heart attack in May 2014, and Samsung shares fell that year and the next before recovering in 2016.Its a perilous practice that a person can take over a company just because he or she was born to a successful father, opposition lawmaker Park Yong-jin said. The biggest problem with our economy is that people with unproven skills run its biggest companies.Lee doesnt play the role of day-to-day manager, depending rather on co-CEOs and other top managers to handle those responsibilities. But employees and shareholders depend on him to provide strategic guidance when it comes to decisions like the next big bets in technology or potential acquisitions.After the elder Lees collapse, executives including J.K. Shin, who is in charge of the smartphone division, handled daily operations for Samsung Electronics.The son became de facto leader of the group, which then embarked on an intricate reorganization to solidify his control. Prosecutors want to know if that effort involved making payments to a presidential confidante in exchange for government support.If Lee is imprisoned, he could be replaced by Samsung Electronics co-chief executive officer Kwon Oh-hyun, a 64-year-old who leads the semiconductor and display businesses. The successes of those two divisions helped propel Samsung to its best operating profit in three years during the quarter ended 31 December.Another candidate is Yoon Boo-keun, who heads the consumer-electronics unit encompassing TVs and appliances.Hes part of the trio with Lee and Kwon that has run Samsung Electronics, said Park Ju-gun, president of Seoul-based corporate watchdog CEOSCORE. Samsung could be run as if that trio were still intact.It also would be natural for Lee Kun-hees eldest daughter to be considered, said Chung Sun-sup, who runs corporate researcher Chaebul.com.Lee Boo-jin, 46, is CEO of the luxury Hotel Shilla Co. chain, which is on track to post revenue growth for a sixth straight year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. She owns 5.5% of Samsung C&T Corp., one of the biggest shareholders in Samsung Electronics.Some speculate she could practically take over, but being a large shareholder doesnt mean she could run a massive company like Samsung Electronics, Chung said. Realistically speaking, Kwon may be the one.Lee Kyung-mook, the Seoul National University professor, also identified her as a candidate to manage the conglomerate, albeit temporarily.A daughter taking over Samsung would break with tradition in South Korea, where sons succeed fathers at the chaebol that dominate the economy. Still, Samsung has been a trailblazer in doing away with old business practices and hiring women aggressively.Lees sister may briefly take the reins, but theres little chance shed take over permanently given she has fewer shares in the firm than her brother, the professor said.The youngest surviving daughter, Lee Seo-hyun, is an executive at Samsung C&T.In the meantime, Jay Y. Lee may miss the window of opportunity to succeed his father as parliament moves to make it harder for Samsung to use its own shares to help him consolidate control, said Heo Pil-seok, CEO at Midas International Asset Management in Seoul. That could make the stock more volatile.Park, the lawmaker, submitted a bill nicknamed the Jay Y. Lee Law to prevent financial firms from supporting the types of internal mergers orchestrated to help Lee boost control.The corporate governance at Samsung could remain awkward for an extended period of time, and that would increase uncertainties, Heo said.The elder Lee faced his own scandalsa 1996 conviction for bribing a former president and a 2008 conviction for embezzlement and tax evasion. Both times, he was pardoned.That history may work against his children, and Jay Y. Lee acknowledged publicly that someone else may take over the collection of about 60 divisions whose combined revenues equal about one-fifth of South Koreas gross domestic product. During a parliamentary hearing before President Parks impeachment, he was asked whether he would surrender management control of Samsung.

20,0.249325,"Crossing the Rs8,000 crore- mark in stand-alone net profit for the first time is a milestone for Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) indeed, but it would have been sweeter if other income had not played a crucial part in it. The December quarters (Q3) net profit was Rs8,022 crore, higher than what many analysts had expected. But other income rose by a third from a year ago to Rs3,025 crore, boosting profit growth to a good extent.
				   
				In fact, the refining business was expected to perform well thanks to a better refining operating environment, as the Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) had improved sequentially. Sure, the companys GRM improved to $10.8 a barrel from $10.1 a barrel in the September quarter but fell short of the expectations of many analysts. For instance, Kotak Institutional Equities and Nomura Research were expecting the measure at $11.3 a barrel and $11.5 a barrel, respectively. RILs premium over benchmark Singapore GRM at $4.1 per barrel is also the lowest in the past three quarters.Even as the petrochemicals business performed well with its Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) increasing 30% from a year earlier, the fact that RILs key business segment hasnt performed as expected is disappointing. Refining business Ebit accounted for almost two-thirds of the companys total Ebit in the quarter. The domestic oil and gas business posted a loss at the Ebit level, due to lower price realizations and lower volumes. The organized retail business has performed well but the segment is relatively small to have a meaningful overall impact.What of the stock? The RIL stock has underperformed the benchmark Sensex index so far this fiscal year. But its worth noting that the share price has appreciated about 16% from its closing low of Rs930 seen on 23 May 2016. Currently, one RIL share trades at 11 times estimated earnings for the next fiscal year. The refining environment continues to remain strong but is already known to investors and may not be enough to override their other concerns.RILs outstanding debt has increased to Rs1,94,381 crore as on 31 December from Rs1,89,132 crore as on 30 September. During the same time frame, cash and cash equivalents declined to Rs76,339 crore from Rs82,533 crore. That could be a concern, according to independent analyst S.P. Tulsian, who said, I believe this is mostly on account of increase in telecom capex, a business from which there is no clarity on revenue or Ebitda from a near-term perspective. The market is not going to react positively due to concerns on negative cash flows and unimpressive profit growth of refining, its core and main business segment, says Tulsian. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.Of course, all eyes will be on the performance of the telecom business. The company has recently expressed confidence saying that it will prove the financial communitys scepticism wrong with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds performance. The year 2017 will see a test of this optimism as Jio turns into a paid service, said CLSA in a report on 2 January.This year will also see stabilization of RILs downstream projects. Analyst expectations of incremental Ebitda from these projects remain markedly below guidance of $3bn-3.5bn, points out CLSA. The low expectations give room for surprise to the upside, added the report. The stock thus is likely to take cues from a combination of telecom and downstream projects news flow, which is where investor attention will also be focused in fiscal year 2018.",2017-01-17,343YGLUtdxSMgy0SZVbXEM,Reliance Industriess GRM improved to $10.8 a barrel from $10.1 a barrel in the September quarter but fell short of the expectations of many analysts,00:36,RILs refining business fails to wow in Q3
384,-0.24485,"Mumbai: One of the biggest drivers of Indias superlative macro-economic performance in the recent past has been a relatively under-appreciated element: oil. Since 2014, the dramatic fall in crude oil prices has helped India contain her twin deficits, and tame inflation. But with oil exporting countries planning to curtail oil supply, raising the possibility of a rise in oil prices, the Indian economy might soon have to deal with another pain point besides demonetisation.
				   
				The extent of the gains from lower oil prices since mid-2014 is under-appreciated as the benefits have not been evident in the retail prices of petrol or diesel. However, the government did improve its finances, using the opportunity to increase the amount of taxes collected on petroleum products, as the charts below illustrate.The excise duty collected by the Union government on petrol and diesel has been hiked nine times since November 2014. The Union governments tax collection from petrol and diesel has increased from 0.4% of GDP in 2013-14 to 1.1% in 2015-16, i.e. an increase of 70 basis points (bps) in two years. To put this in perspective, this is more than the 60 bps reduction achieved in gross fiscal deficit (from 4.5% of GDP to 3.9% of GDP) over the same period. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.In other words, the entire reduction in Indias fiscal deficit could be attributed to the increase in Centres tax revenue from petrol and diesel alone. Hence, it is fair to say that falling crude oil prices have driven the improvements in Indias public finances over the past couple of years. Looking at more recent data for the first half of the fiscal year ending March 2017 (April-September 2016), and combining taxes with other oil-linked receipts such as dividends from public sector petroleum companies and states VAT collection on petroleum products, we find that the total receipts of the Centre and state governments from the petroleum sector have risen by about 50 bps since fiscal 2015 to 3.14%.Even the above-mentioned gains from the petroleum sector might be an underestimate because besides the increase in taxes, the Centre also gained from reduced subsidy burden owing to the fall in crude prices. Diesel prices were deregulated in 2014 and the diesel subsidy was eliminated in the last fiscal year (2015-16) itself. Previously, subsidy on diesel would cost 0.6% of GDP (FY14), jointly borne by the government and the public sector petroleum companies. Besides, subsidies on PDS kerosene and LPG have also reduced; however these reductions could also be attributed to government initiative to reform rather than a fall in petroleum prices per se. The upcoming Union Budget 2017 is likely to assume an average crude oil price of $55-$60 per barrel, as reported by the Hindustan Times. However, there remain risks that oil prices, which are already near $55 per barrel, could shoot up if the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and other oil exporters make good on their pledge to cut global oil supply by around 1.8%. Such a scenario, according to the International Energy Agency, would move the global oil market into deficit in the first half of 2017, i.e. demand would outstrip supply, after more than two years of comfortable surplus.In such a scenario, if oil rises above the governments comfort zone to say around $70 per barrel, then the government could lose tax revenues equivalent to about 0.4% of GDP which would jeopardize the governments plan to cut the fiscal deficit to 3% of GDP next year.To illustrate, in a hypothetical scenario where the global crude oil price is $70 per barrel in the coming fiscal year (2017-18) and the USD/INR exchange rate remains stable at 68, the government could either allow the petrol price (Delhi) to rise by another Rs10 to over Rs80 per litre, or reduce its excise tax duty from currently Rs21.48 per litre to Rs11.48 (if it wishes to keep prices same). If the government decides to reduce excise duties on petrol and diesel in similar fashion, then the Centres revenue from petrol and diesel could shrink to 0.7% of GDP in fiscal year 2018 compared to 1.1% in fiscal year 2016, back-of-the-envelope calculations show (assuming annual growth of 11.4% and 4.1% in demand for petrol and diesel respectively, as has been observed in the year so far). Thus, a spike in oil price to around $70 per barrel is enough to strain our public finances and add 0.4% to the Centres fiscal deficit. This would be over and above the increasing expenditure obligations on interest, salaries and pensions, compounded by Seventh Pay Commission recommendations and OROP. Read more If the government wishes to keep petrol and diesel prices unchanged, without sacrificing its tax revenues, then it would have to resort to subsidies (or under-recoveries) as used to be the case in yesteryears. Thus, no matter the recourse adopted, government finances will most likely be hit severely if oil prices rise, unless the government allows the prices of petroleum products to rise. Besides posing risks for the governments finances and stoking the fires of inflation, a rise in oil prices would also worsen the current account deficit. Assuming crude oil prices at $70/barrel and pencilling a constant pace of rise in volumes in oil imports and exports, as seen in the current fiscal year so far, and keeping all other things constant, Indias current account deficit could widen to 1.7% of GDP in fiscal 2018 compared to 1.1% of GDP in fiscal 2016.Indias net oil and gas import bill, i.e. adjusting for exports of petroleum products, amounts to around 2.5% of GDP, higher than Indias overall current account deficit and hence plays a big role in determining the dynamics related to the balance of payments. Thus, if there is one commodity to watch out for in 2017, it is likely to be oil.",2017-01-18,ro8NqXjBC4gk1i2OAQdGYN,The entire reduction in Indias fiscal deficit over the past few years can be attributed to the fall in crude oil prices,08:51,Why oil can spoil Indias budget math

				According to Indian Railways Mission 41k initiative, the national carrier will electrify 24,000km of rail tracks over the next five years by doubling the annual rate of electrification from 2,000km to 4,000km in the next two years. To achieve this target, the railways plans to follow the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) model of awarding contracts for railway electrification projects. It also plans to mechanize the execution through self-propelled wiring trains among other initiatives.ALSO READ: Suresh Prabhu unveils non-fare revenue policy for Indian RailwaysPrabhu said switching from diesel to electric can help railways in a big way. Through electrification, railways can reduce dependence on imported fuel and rationalize the cost of energy. He added that the 10-year plan, which started in 2015 on a pilot basis, will continue till 2025 and has already started yielding results.Railways has already saved Rs300 crore during 2015-16 and Rs1,000 crore till November 2016. We hope this year the savings would be around Rs1,800 crore through energy management, said a railway ministry official, requesting anonymity.Apart from electrification of tracks, the other initiatives under Mission 41k are change in the carriers energy mix by using more green energy through 1,000 megawatt (MW) solar and 200MW wind plants, installation of LED lights and bulbs across all railway stations, trains and offices.If consumption of only one class of fuel grows, it will lead to skewed development of the energy mix, said B. Ashok, chairman of Indian Oil Corp., the countrys largest oil marketing company. During 2014-15, the total energy cost of Indian Railways was Rs31,220 crore. This included expenditure of Rs10,436 crore towards electric traction which carries about two thirds of the total freight and about 50% of passenger traffic; R 18,586 crore towards diesel traction which carries the balance one-third of freight and about 50% of passenger traffic and Rs2,198 crore towards supply of electrical energy to various offices, workshops and railway stations, etc. The move comes as railways projects a six-fold increase in its passenger and freight traffic by 2030. The passenger and freight traffic on the railways in India is expected to grow from 3.64 trillion passenger kilometers and 961 billion tonne kilometres respectively in 2005 to 19.4 trillion passenger kilometres and 6.68 trillion tonne kilometres, respectively by 2030.",2017-01-18,0pohrH57gXWqdyJ1vdzmsL,"Railway minister Suresh Prabhu says that as part of Mission 41k, railway electrification can reduce dependence on imported fuel and rationalize energy cost",00:49,"Prabhu unveils 10-year energy plan for Railways to save Rs41,000 crore"

98,0.248775,"London/New York: Wall Streets high-flyers in Davos, basking in their firms strong fourth-quarter earnings, said theyre confident Donald Trumps incoming administration will loosen regulatory constraints on financierseven if it leaves Barack Obamas signature Dodd-Frank Act largely intact.
				   
				Bank executives, speaking on condition of anonymity at events around the Swiss ski resort, said theyre not counting on Trump to overturn Dodd-Frank. Instead, they expect the federal agencies that enforce the rules to ease up on them and support bankers efforts to limit how much capital and liquidity their companies need to pay bills or absorb losses in a crisis.The bankers said they recognize that changing or overturning the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act would require support in the US Senate that Republicans may lack. Instead theyre counting on Trumps team to dial back how supervisory agencies enforce and interpret rules. Led by Federal Reserve governor Daniel Tarullo, US regulators have adopted an extra-strict version of the global standards on capital and liquidity set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.ALSO READ | A warning to Donald Trump from Friedrich HayekLegislation, obviously thats harder to do than just changing regulations, JPMorgan Chase & Co. chief executive officer Jamie Dimon said in a Bloomberg Television interview with John Micklethwait on Wednesday. Regulators can change a lot of things easily about compliance, about costs, certain rules about lending, how you use your liquidity, how you use your capital. I would like to see some of those looked at and maybe modified a bit, and I think it would be good for the economy.At a panel discussion on the global banking outlook in Davos Thursday morning, JPMorgan asset-management CEO Mary Callahan Erdoes echoed that view.Its going to be a great several years, Erdoes said. Its going to be very positive for businesses in the US, which should cascade to businesses around the world.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO Lloyd Blankfein offered a similarly optimistic view in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Davos on Thursday.If you look at the policies that Trump has committed himself to, they are quite stimulative and quite market-supportive, Blankfein said. If you look at spending on infrastructure, lower tax rate and overlapping regulation, they are quite stimulative, far more stimulative than what people were expecting had the Democrats won the election.The Goldman Sachs CEO also said theres an opportunity to re-legislate financial regulations as the US did with the Securities Exchange Act after the Great Depression.I think were going to open it up, Blankfein said. You can call it Dodd-Frank, as amended.ALSO READ | These automakers could be Donald Trumps next targetsWall Street bank shares, including JPMorgans and Goldman Sachss, have rallied since the election on speculation that Trumps policies will accelerate economic growth and drive higher interest rates.While Trumps transition team said after the election that it would work to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act and replace it with new policies to encourage economic growth and job creation, few bankers see Dodd-Frank as a priority. Even billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who Trump appointed as a special adviser last month to overhaul regulations, said in a CNN interview that he wouldnt support killing Dodd-Frank.Several bankers in Davos said theyre optimistic that regulators under Trump could do away with the gold-plating by the US of the latest Basel benchmarks and ease the process by which banks are stress-tested annually to ensure they have adequate capital to absorb losses in a hypothetical crisis.In Europe, where bankers argue the regions economic woes are exacerbated by the constraints on lenders, regulators have already helped delay agreement on a new set of global requirements.The Federal Reserve has led US rule-making efforts, including Basel implementation. Trump can appoint a vice-chairman for regulation, effectively replacing Tarullo, who has filled the role unofficially and antagonized bankers with his strict approach to regulation. That, along with other appointments, could help tip the Fed toward a more bank-friendly approach.ALSO READ | Wary of Donald Trump, China hails Obama for progress in Sino-US tiesIt also could be wishful thinking. While criticizing Dodd-Frank, Republican leaders in Congress have backed even higher capital requirements than the Fed for the largest banks. Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has proposed exempting banks from most other rules in exchange for 10% capital, almost twice as much as what big banks have now.New regulators could also change the way Dodd-Frank is implemented. One part bankers hate the most, the Volcker Rule, bans the largest firms from making speculative bets with their own money. Trumps Treasury secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, the Goldman Sachs co-president named to serve as Trumps chief economic policy adviser, are expected to be more sympathetic to banks arguments that limiting their trading hurts investors by making fixed-income securities less liquid.While trading revenue has declined in recent years, the Volcker Rule and other restrictions didnt prevent a jump last year, including at Goldman Sachs, where one trader made $250 million for his firm last year.JPMorgans Dimon and other executives also have pushed against international liquidity standards that were part of the post-crisis Basel regime and designed to ensure that firms have enough easy-to-sell assets to meet claims coming due in a month and over a year.Theres $2.5 trillion sitting at the central bank called excess reserves, Dimon said in Davos. And were not free to lend it because of all these new requirements.Asked whether laws will change or just how theyre enforced, Bank of America Corp. CEO Brian Moynihan told Erik Schatzker in Davos that I think it will be the implementation of regulation, adding later that he expects a regulatory debate about what the right regulation is and how it will be mitigated over time. Bloomberg",2017-01-19,Cm9YqAFaQZXGdngQqBvMEP,Wall Street bank shares have rallied since the election on speculation that Donald Trumps policies will accelerate economic growth and drive higher interest rates,22:06,Bankers in Davos see Donald Trump making Wall Street great again

The bank said that the creation of @ybl virtual payment address that Phone Pe uses violates the interoperability rules of the UPI platform.ICICI blocks PhonePe transactions in sign of banks moving to protect payments turfAn ICICI Bank spokesperson said NPCI had given the bank a written assurance that PhonePe will allow interoperability. As soon as this is corrected, ICICI Bank will start allowing UPI transactions to resume on this app, the spokesperson said. ICICI Bank is one of the 10 promoters of NPCI and owned 7.47% of its shares as on 22 January 2016, according to the Watal committee report. In September, NPCI said it had broad-based its shareholding to include 46 new banks, but didnt specify what the new shareholding structure is.Yes Bank defended PhonePe in a statement to stock exchanges, stating that the app had complied with all the rules laid down by NCPI. All member banks who are offering UPI services have undergone exactly the same process and were allowed to go live only after complying with the same process, said Yes Bank.On Sunday, the lender said it had temporarily blocked transactions originating from PhonePe, pending the resolution of its concerns related to restrictive practices followed by the app. This entity is following restrictive practices allowing users to make payments with only its UPI handle, which is in contravention to the UPI guidelines of interoperability and choice that empowers a customer to choose any app to make payments through UPI, an ICICI spokesperson said.Flipkarts PhonePe crosses 10 million downloads on Google Play StorePhonePes co-founder and chief executive officer Sameer Nigam took to Twitter on 14 January to allege that ICICI was abruptly blocking its customers from using the app. Separately, in an open letter released on Tuesday, the company said that more than 20,000 UPI transactions amounting to more than Rs5 crore by value had failed after ICICI Banks action. We followed all the detailed guidelines and procedures laid down by NPCI for an app to go live on UPI. We went through over a 100+ use case test cases, detailed certification, vulnerability assessment, penetration testing and third-party application security testing, before NPCI gave us permission to go live. PhonePe has been live since August 2016 and none of these issues have been raised earlier, PhonePe clarified in its letter.PhonePe said in its letter it wasnt fully compliant with NPCIs Android Intent Calls guidelines, but added that the deadline for compliance was 31  January. It also pointed out that other UPI apps including Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) have not been updated to meet these guidelines. These guidelines state that when a payment is to be made, an app will initiate an intent call to other UPI apps present on a mobile device. PhonePe declined to comment on Thursday, saying it had not got any official communication from NPCI yet. This is the second instance of a commercial bank blocking transactions arising from non-bank mobile wallet and payment services companies.

				Delhis peak power demand this winter is expected to be around 4,500-4,600 mega watt (MW), compared to around 4,125MW a year ago, according to a spokesperson for two units of BSES promoted by Reliance Infrastructure Ltd supplying power in the National Capital Region (NCR). Peak winter power demand in NCR which has steadily risen from 3,678MW in 2010, has already crossed last years winter peak. Last summer, peak demand had touched 6,188MW in the capital on 20 May, about a quarter more than the peak summer demand around the same time a year ago. Energy demand peaks in mornings and early night hours compared to the average level of supply and forms a component in the electricity tariff to the consumer. It makes sense for a consumer to keep her peak demand lower as power generation companies have to  invest in extra capacity required to service the peak demand which remains idle at other times. According to Praveer Sinha, chief executive officer and managing director at Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd, Delhi may see a rise in winter peak power demand as compared to previous years due to the persistent cold wave. We all are experiencing a dip in the temperature to the coldest minimum since 2013, which has led to the increase in demand. At Tata Power-DDL, we have made prior arrangements to meet the rising demand...We have tied up through long-term power supply, banking as well as procurement on short term though the exchange, said Sinha.ALSO READ | Indias five hottest years since 1901 came in past 15 years, IMD data showsPower banking is a barter system of supplying excess power available to a distribution company to a counterpart which can be sourced back at another season at no cost.

In case of any unforeseeable contingency, BSES discoms will buy short-term power from the exchange which is available at economical rates, said the company spokesperson. BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd will bank the surplus of around 200MW with states like Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Meghalaya. BSES Yamuna Power Ltd (BYPL) has arranged for an additional 150MW from Punjab for December and January. To reduce the night surplus, BYPL will supply around 175MW to Bihar between December and March, said the spokesperson. This year, winter came late in the north and central parts of India. Two sets of cold waves, first between 11-15 January and the second between 18-19 January led to a severe fall in temperature across many parts of north and central India. In the first spell, Delhis minimum temperature dropped to 3.4 degrees Celsius on 12 January, the lowest in January in three years. Churu in Rajasthan recorded a minimum temperature of -1.9°C, seven degrees below average, making it the coldest city in the country on 12 January.According to India Meteorological Department, another cold wave will grip the northern parts of the country in the next few days which would lead to a fall in temperature.

				Twice over.In Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), a business he will lead until 21 February, Chandra, as he is popularly known, has spent almost 30 years, his entire working life.He started as a software programmer with TCS in 1987 and rose through the ranks to become one of the youngest chief executive officers (CEOs) in Tata group when he was 46 years old in 2009.Now, as he prepares to take over as chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, Chandrasekaran is in effect getting ready to run another marathon.He is 53 and the retirement age for top Tata executives is 70, giving him a potential 17 years at the helm of the $103-billion group that has businesses ranging from salt to steel and tea to telecom.Running a marathon is also a metaphor for running a business, according to Chandrasekaran.You have to decide on the length of the engagement, develop endurance to handle setbacks and increase speed when the competition demands it, Chandrasekaran said in an interview to Runners World magazine in October 2015 (bit.ly/2iFOCtK).You have to perform with your heart and your mind; you will not get lost on the way if you have a good road map; you will get nowhere without discipline. This is what I always tell my employees in speeches, he said.He will start running his new marathon at a time when Tata group is in the midst of a bruising battle with its former chairman, Cyrus Mistry, who was sacked on 24 October in a boardroom putsch, less than four years after he succeeded family scion Ratan Tata.Also read: Tata vs Mistry: NCLT dismisses contempt of court plea filed by Mistry firmsThe feud between Mistry, who has accused the 149-year old business house of a variety of corporate governance violations, and Tata has reached the National Company Law Tribunal, or NCLT, where a long and messy legal battle is looming.The Mistry family is the largest minority shareholder in Tata Sons, the holding company of the group.We are at an inflection point, Chandrasekaran wrote in an emailed statement after his appointment. I am aware that this role comes with huge responsibilities. It will be my endeavour to help progress the group with the ethos, ethics and values that the Tata group has been built on.A Tata Sons spokesperson said the chairman-designate was not available for interviews immediately.Chandrasekaran, we believe will now inspire the entire Tata group to realize its potential acting as leaders in their respective businesses, always in keeping with our value system and ethics and adhering with the practices of the Tata group which have stood it in good stead, the Tata Sons board said in a statement on 12 January while announcing his elevation. The five-member selection committee chose him unanimously, it added.Also read: Tata Sons new chairman has twin obstaclesa family and a conglomerateChandrasekaran would be no stranger to the value systems and the practices that the board is talking about. The man who would have been a farmer joined the company after completing his Masters degree in computer applications from the Regional Engineering College in Trichy, Tamil Nadu. Over time, he has worked in a variety of positions (chief operating officer, executive assistant to S. Ramadorai, the previous CEO), and places (California and Stockholm). In that sense, he is an insider.He is an outsider because he is the first truly professional chairman of the Tata Sons board who is not related to the Tata family.Nowroji Saklatwala, the third chairman of the group, was the nephew of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of Tata group. Cyrus Mistry is the brother-in-law of Noel Tata, half brother of Ratan Tata.This can be interpreted in two ways: Either the Tatas chose a safe option by choosing an insider, or the group took a step forward to regain its tarnished credibility by choosing a non-family memberand one with a proven track recordto lead the firm.Also read: N. Chandrasekaran begins long road to restoring Tata groups imageIndeed, Chandrasekarans first task will be to restore the reputation of the group and the sheen of brand Tata.A day after his ouster, Mistry (in a letter that subsequently found its way into the public domain) said the Tata group was beset with a host of corporate governance issues.The group was staring at a potential $18-billion write-down, he claimed. It persisted with a loss-making project, the Nano small car, because it was an obsession with Ratan Tata; there was undue interference from some of the trustees of the Tata Trusts, which own two-thirds of Tata Sons; some friends and associates of Ratan Tata benefited from Tata group contractsthey all were a part of Mistrys lists of allegations.Subsequently, the listed companies of the Tata group lost 6.1% (till 16 January) of their market capitalization, and regulators began asking questions.The controversy at Tata group is not his (Chandrasekarans) creation. He just needs to ride it out. I think if he can build a reasonably supportive relationship with Cyrus, it will be good for the image of corporate India, said Ganesh Natarajan, vice-chairman at Zensar Technologies Ltd, who has worked with Chandrasekaran at software industry lobby Nasscom.Restoring the reputation is just a start. The fact remains that the Tata group has several underperformers. The so-called legacy hot spots which were named by MistryTata Power Co. Ltds Mundra plant in western Gujarat, Tata Steel Europe, Indian Hotels Co. Ltd, Tata Teleservices Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd passenger vehiclesall are pressure points.For instance, in the four years to fiscal 2016, Tata Steel has taken an impairment charge of at least Rs24,175 crore, most of it attributed to the European assets that it acquired with the 2007 purchase of Corus Group Plc for £6.7 billion (Rs54,000 crore today).In the past fiscal, losses at Coastal Gujarat Power Ltd (CGPL), which houses the Mundra plant, were Rs1,491.86 crore.Looking at data aggregated between 2011 and 2015 and limit the analysis largely to the legacy hot spots, it will show that the capital employed in those companies has risen from Rs1.32 trillion to Rs1.96 trillion A realistic assessment of the fair value of these businesses could potentially result in a write-down over time of Rs1.18 trillion, Mistry pointed out in his letter.But it wont be easy to rejuvenate these businesses. Selling or exiting them wont be a quick option since it will call into question the business wisdom and legacy of group patriarch Ratan Tata.Look at Tata Steel. Corus is a disaster, said T.V. Mohandas Pai, chairman of Manipal Global Education and former board of director at Infosys Ltd. Cyrus tried to change that by selling assets, but they ousted him as they said it was against Tata values, said Pai.Tata values, he said, cannot be based on destruction of shareholders value.Pai terms Chandrasekaran as a go getter who is great at marketing and building relationships, but he is not sure if he will get the much-needed free hand to run Tata Sons.Once he takes charge at Tata Sons, the key issue wont be whether he will be able to do well, but whether he will have operational freedom, he said.This talk of freedom to operate that Pai is talking about goes to the crux of Mistrys accusations.Mistry, in his 25 October letter, said he had been reduced to the position of a lame duck chairman.He accused Tata Trusts and some of the trusteesRatan Tata and Noshir Soonawala, in particularof excessive interference in the running of listed Tata companies.Documents filed by the Mistry family firmsCyrus Investments Pvt. Ltd and Sterling Investments Pvt. Ltdin NCLT alleged mismanagement of Tata Sons and oppression of minority shareholders, cited some examples and called them shadow directors.These charges have been strongly refuted by Tata and Soonawala in affidavits they filed in reply.Also read: Why Natarajan Chandrasekaran is a safe choice for Ratan TataLeaving this issue aside, Chandrasekaran will anyway have to establish a good working relationship with the principal shareholders of Tata Sons, both in terms of navigating the three-tier structure of the groupTata Trusts, Tata Sons and Tata group operating companiesand in meeting their expectations.Already, the trustees have come out with statements highlighting their concerns.The new leadership at Tata Sons should ensure that the overall profitability and income of the group improves, and the dividend payout by Tata Sons to Tata Trusts not only stabilizes but also increases, said V.R. Mehta, a trustee of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, in an interview, a day after Chandrasekarans elevation was announced.The main worry of the trust was the decline in the dividend income of Tata Sons from the operating companies, he said.In a 10 November statement, Tata Sons had pointed out that with the exception of TCS, all 40 other firms (many non-dividend paying) in its portfolio paid dividends that have continuously declined from Rs1,000 crore in 2012-13 to Rs780 crore in 2015-16.It said even the Rs780-crore figure included an interim dividend of Rs100 crore, which would have been normally received in 2016-17. Shriram Subramanian, managing director at InGovern Reearch, a proxy advisory firm, says while Chandrasekarans capabilities are beyond doubt, he needs to ensure that better corporate governance practices prevail in the group, and he is not seen as a yes man to Ratan Tata.Also read: Chandras true test will be shutting down Tatas loss-making businesses: Aswath DamodaranIn TCS at least, Chandrasekaran has proven to be his own man as can be seen from the 2008 reorganization of the software firm into five groups, whose directors began reporting directly to him.But the challenges will be different now, when it comes to dealing with other group CEOs, many of them his peers.To some extent, Chandra will also be constrained by not having the experience of having dealt with huge debt and with bankers, said Subramanian.TCS has been the cash cow of Tata group. It accounts for around 17.5% of the total revenue of the conglomerate. It is the company which spews cash to fund Tata ventures into newer businesses, allowing Tata Sons to act like a private equity investor.Chandrasekarans role so far has been to keep it running smoothly and build on the gains made previously; under him, TCSs market capitalization and revenues grew more than three times. But now, he needs to figure out ways to replicate his success with TCS in unfamiliar businesses.The culture in the IT (information technology) industry is one of youthful exuberance, service orientation, technological innovation and collaborative learningan antithesis to the rough and tough shop-floor realities of old-world industries, wrote Prabal Basu Roy, a Sloan Fellow from the London Business School and a chartered accountant, in a column on 14 January. Therefore, this cultural and skill set mismatch will be a major challengethough charismatic leadership can overcome some of this.But such concerns are brushed aside by Tata insiders.Also read: The many challenges of Natarajan ChandrasekaranIf the group chairman knows everything, it will create over dependence and everyone would look upon him rather than doing it on their own, said K. Santhanakrishnan, non-executive and non-independent director at Tata Global Beverages Ltd. The group needs his soft skills. The hardware already exists in the form of professionally managed boards and professional executive management. His experience in the software industry which has linkages with all the sectors and his wide international exposure and acceptability across, would really help the group.Chandrasekaran takes charge at a time when the group needs a strategic reorientation. With the election of Donald Trump, who has vowed to protect American jobs, as US President and the shift in customers spending patterns from traditional IT services to a digital domain, TCS itself is going to face tough times and may not be able to sustain its dividend track record.At the same time, tough calls have to be made to bring down group debt, which stands at Rs2.25 trillion, and which new businesses to focus on.The reactions I get to my philosophy are heartwarming. No less than a thousand employees responded to my call to run the Mumbai Marathon together, Chandrasekaran said in the Runners World interview.To succeed in his new job and successfully complete the metaphorical marathon he is embarking on, he will need a similar response from the 660,000 employees of Tata group.",2017-01-20,PUT0dMs7Buh2WJTdbafJzM,MintAsia examines the challenges Natarajan Chandrasekaran faces  as he prepares to take the helm at Tata Sons at a time when the group is engaged in an ugly feud with its ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry,01:26,Marathon Man
236,-0.123475,"New Delhi/ Mumbai:  Explorers in the worlds fastest-growing oil market are seeking lower taxes on crude produced from local fields to encourage fresh drilling as India tries to reduce its dependence on energy imports.
				   
				State-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) and the biggest private producer Cairn India Ltd. want finance minister Arun Jaitley to at least halve the cess on crude oil production in the Union budget due 1 February. India surprised some explorers last year with its 20% ad-valorem tax on every ton of crude produced locally, moving from a fixed charge. Companies pay more now with crude near $50 a barrel than they did under the old system when it was double the price.Globally, given the low oil price scenario, governments have provided incentives to stimulate and attract investments, said Sudhir Mathur, interim chief executive officer at Cairn India. In India, the cess rate of 20% acts as a disincentive to increase production and commit incremental investments.Attracting investments to boost output from local fields is key for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has made energy security a priority and set a target of cutting oil imports by 10% in the next five years. Reducing the levy will help explorers including ONGC and Cairn India, which oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan estimates will spend $25 billion by the end of this decade. Indias hydrocarbon resources are highly undeveloped and production has been declining for the past several years, prompting the government to nudge companies to invest in reversing the fall and increase energy supplies.New Delhi-based ONGC is spending over $5 billion for its biggest development plan in a deep-sea block in the Bay of Bengal off the countrys east coast. Cairn India also plans to spend as much as $4 billion over the next few years to drill for oil.Asias third-largest economy meets about 80% of its crude oil requirements through imports.We need some money to be left behind so that we are able to flow back into the investment cycle, said A.K. Srinivasan, finance director at ONGC, the nations biggest explorer.Otherwise there will be cash shortage. Already, we are going to run cash shortages.At a price of $55 a barrel, ONGC may have to pay about $11 as cess, compared with $9 when prices were $100 a barrel and the tax was fixed charge, he said. With crude prices firming up, the cost impact of this tax is quite high.Brent oil prices have risen about 17% since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) agreed in November to cut production for six months starting in January. The fuel traded above $100 as recently as September 2014.Firming crude prices may also allow the government to reduce the levy on retail prices for gasoline and diesel, according to Dhaval Joshi, an analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd.India didnt pass on to consumers the entire benefit of crudes price decline from July 2014, increasing excise duty on the two fuels nine times and mopping up about Rs960 billion ($14 billion) in the previous two fiscal years.The government may now look at easing prices as one way of cushioning the impact of its 8 November ban on high-denomination currency notes, which impacted the rural population the most, as it prepares for five state elections this quarter. The consumer price of diesel, the most-used fuel in the country, is at a record while that of gasoline is at the highest since August 2014, according to state-run fuel retailer Indian Oil Corp.s (IOL) website.

				The report, authored by Sreenidhi Srinivasan and Namrata Mukherjee, research fellows at Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy, analysed the current rules and norms in place for data protection.At a time when India is seeking to develop as a digital economy, it is imperative to have in place an effective regime for protection of personal information, the report said. India is pushing digital (and cashless) transactions, some linked to the biometrics-based Aadhaar number which has been assigned to around a billion Indians by the Unique Identification Authority of India.ALSO READ | Indias privacy non-lawThe paper compared the Indian data protection regime with  international ones and found it lacking on several counts. The paper identified a lack of a statute expressly recognizing privacy rights of an individual and rights over their personal data, especially in an interplay with non-state actors and firms. The Vidhi paper enumerated important components of a robust data protection regime: entities required to comply with data protection norms; the kind of information to be protected; consent for collecting information; and the individuals right to access his or her information held by another organization. The 77-page report also provided a framework for management of personal data, which could serve as a model for a data protection statute or be assimilated in the IT Rules.ALSO READ | Sustaining transition to a digital economyThe paper argued for extension of data protection to all personal data and not merely sensitive personal data (the first includes passwords, financial information, health conditions, medical history, sexual orientation, biometric information). It also suggested seeking consent of individuals before collecting all personal information. Rahul Matthan, partner at Trilegal and a Mint columnist appreciated the work done by Vidhi on data protection, but says hed like a model of data protection more suited to the Indian context. Their approach seems to be to analyse the way international statutes have been written and try to see whats appropriate in the Indian context. While that is the global best practice for new sector legislation I think there is merit in also considering an approach that allows us to build something from the ground up which is appropriate for us in our context, he said.ALSO READ | Going digital is good, but beware of risksMatthan pointed to flaws in the consent model for protecting data. For instance, the consent framework, which is a world standard, is universally recognized as flawed and very hard to administer given the amount of data being collected from us and in the context of the Internet of Things where machines collect data automatically, he said.Pranesh Prakash, policy director at think tank Centre for Internet and Society, said the paper did not delve into a 2012 report of a group of experts on privacy chaired by justice A.P.

That report made suggestions including a technology-neutral law on privacy applicable to both government and private agencies. I look forward to examining the report and working with Vidhi and others to advance a robust data protection regime in India, Prakash said.",2017-01-20,32kLqMlXEh0w4GhvLKxGkN,Report cites a lack of statute recognizing privacy rights and rights over personal data,01:37,Indian data protection norms insufficient: report
117,0.1921,"Davos: Indias biggest lender by assets, State Bank of India (SBI), could tap capital markets next fiscal year to raise up to $1.5 billion, its chief said on Friday, though it first needs to complete a planned merger with its subsidiary banks.
				   
				In an interview with Reuters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Arundhati Bhattacharya also said the lender would look to raise funds from stake sales in its life insurance unit that could list in a year to 18 months, and by paring its holding in UTI Asset Management Co., which is also looking to go public.We do plan to raise some capital. However, this is also dependent on the fact that there is a merger that we are planning to do, said Bhattacharya, 60, who has been at the helm of SBI as its chairman since late 2013. SBI, which is merging its five subsidiary banks with itself and also taking over a small state-run lender for women, previously expected the merger to be completed by March. The deals could now get delayed by a quarter, Bhattacharya said, as banks are still busy replacing withdrawn banknotes after Indias sudden move in November to cancel 86% of its currency.

Bhattacharya said activities were slowly getting back to normal as effects of the banknote ban subside, although it would still take until the end of February to fully gauge the impact.Bhattacharya hoped recent lending rate cuts by banks including SBI, after they were flush with billions of dollars of deposits following the banknote ban, would help kickstart credit growth, which is hovering near two-decade lows.We feel that credit growth will pick up ... definitely by the second half of next (fiscal) year we should see substantial pick up, she said.

419,0.05555,"Washington/San Francisco:  Apple Inc. sued Qualcomm Inc., accusing it of monopolizing the market for chips for wireless devices and withholding $1 billion in retaliation for cooperating with South Korean antitrust authorities.
				   
				Apple is demanding Qualcomm hand over money that was supposed to be a rebate for licensing fees. Qualcomm is holding back the money as punishment for Apple cooperating with Korean antitrust regulators, according to the complaint filed in San Diego, where Qualcomm is based.Apple also wants back some of the billions of dollars it claims it was overcharged in Qualcomms illegal scheme to control the market for mobile phone chips. It wants a court to change how Qualcomm charges for its technology in the future.Qualcomm, the largest maker of mobile phone chips, has been under fire by regulators around the world for its patent licensing practices. The lawsuit filed on Friday is the first direct challenge by one of its biggest customers and threatens to upend how royalties are calculated by any owner of a patent on technology that underlies modern electronics.Apple is facing pressure to squeeze more profit out of every iPhone after revenue declined last year for the first time since 2001, dragged down by lower handset sales. It typically sources the same component from several suppliers, which helps secure lower prices by forcing the manufacturers to compete on price.Qualcomm fell 2.4% to $63 at the close in New York. Apple rose less than 1% to $120.It is quite clear that Apples claims are baseless, Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement. Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing program.Also Read: Apple is ready to start making iPhones in India, but at a priceQualcomm also accused Apple of encouraging regulators to attack Qualcomm in various jurisdictions around the world, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information.Legacy standardsQualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties, Apple said in a statement. Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined.The complaint also challenges the validity of some key Qualcomm patents for wireless technologies. Apple asks the court to rule that, if the patents are upheld, that the royalty amount is significantly lower than what Qualcomm charges now.In December, South Korea, home to two of Qualcomms largest customers, fined the company 1.03 trillion won ($890 million) and described its practices as monopolistic. Qualcomm has said it will appeal the decision.Antitrust investigationsUnder the agreement with Qualcomm, Apple said it was forced to refrain from taking any steps to challenge Qualcomms business model.Apple complied with investigation demands from Korean regulators, an action Qualcomm claimed was in violation of the agreement. In retaliation, Qualcomm withheld money that it was due to pay Apple in royalty rebates, the iPhone maker said.Qualcomm offered to pay the money if Apple retracted and corrected its statements to government agencies, according to the complaint.South Korean regulators arent the only authorities investigating Qualcomm.Patent royaltiesThe US Federal Trade Commission on 17 January filed its own antitrust suit against Qualcomm. The chipmaker is also being investigated by the European Union and Taiwanese authorities.At the heart of the dispute between Apple and Qualcomm is a push by phone makers with the support of regulators to reduce the patent royalties Qualcomm charges.Qualcomm gets the bulk of its revenue from selling chips, but more than half of its profit from the separate licensing business. Its patents cover the fundamentals of cellular technology, allowing it to rake in billions in licensing fees. In other words, the chipmaker gets paid regardless of whether its chips are used in mobile phones or not.One common thread in all of the cases is the contention that royalty rates should be calculated as a percentage of the price of the components in the phone that Qualcomm invents and sells  measured in tens of dollars. Currently licensing is a percentage of the price of the entire phone, which is usually in the hundreds of dollars.Companies collaborate to develop industry standards so that the devices can communicate with each other. Since they have the ability to ensure their inventions get included in the standards, they pledge to license on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.Qualcomm has breached that pledge by refusing to license its patents to Intel Corp., a rival chipmaker thats been providing some chips to Apple for the past year, according to the complaint.Bullying accusationsApple accused Qualcomm of bullying it, threatening to withhold chip supply, forcing it to agree not to challenge Qualcomms patents and using Apple innovations to help its competitors. Much of the money Qualcomm collects on the iPhone or iPad is paid by third-party manufacturers who pass along the cost, according to the complaint. Apple said Qualcomm can demand higher royalties because those manufacturers have no incentive to negotiate.Apple said its not allowed to see those agreements, and believes Qualcomm gets paid multiple times on the same device. Since Qualcomm wont give Apple a direct license, it instead agreed to give Apple a rebate  money that its now withholding.The case is Apple Inc. v.

				Banks may allow up to three spells of moratorium (not exceeding 6 months each) during life cycle of education loan, taking into account spells of unemployment/underemployment, without treating the exercise as restructuring, RBI said in a letter to the Indian Banks Association (IBA). However, banks would be required to maintain a higher provisioning of 5% during the additional moratorium period and one year thereafter. The RBIs response was on a clarification sought by the IBA whether the education loans with extended repayment period be treated as restructured loans. The facility of extended repayment period and increased number of moratorium for repayment may be extended to existing borrowers whose accounts are classified as standard..., said the RBI. As per RBIs master circular of July 2015, accounts that are restructured from April 2015 will attract higher provisioning and will be classified as NPA. In 2013, the department of financial services (DFS) had notified that if the repayments in education loans are extended due to revision in the repayment period, the same may not be treated as restructuring. IBA had written to RBI to confirm that the notification of DFS of 2013 holds good even now and that banks need not treat such extended repayment period of education loans as restructuring. IBA said the relaxation in repayment of loans is needed as it may so happen that a borrower fails to get a good income or a job if the market has a slow-down.

Selling surplus power to the grid enables a roof top solar power plant owner to recover the cost of the plant.I am given to understand that in some smart meter tender for only 10,000 units, the quotations were of Rs3,000. Now if 10,000 meters can be bought or sold for Rs3,000, imagine the price that can be discovered at a scale of 25 crore smart meters. We have the example of LED bulbs, Goyal said. The governments efficient lighting programme has led to a decline in the public procurement price of LED bulbs sharply to just over Rs 50 apiece from more than Rs300 less than two years ago. Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd. is now installing 200,000 smart meters and is planning to scale it up to 1.5 million in five to six years, while Reliance Power Ltd-owned BSES Yamuna Power Ltd and BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd, which supply electricity in Delhi, are also installing smart meters for customers in phases. Smart meter can be a game changer when it comes to planning the electricity sector in the long run, said Goyal. The central government is prompting state-owned power distribution utilities to improve operational and billing efficiency under the Ujjwal Assurance Discom Yojna rolled out in November 2015. Our electrical industry should come up with indigenous innovation. It is important that we look at our own situation and come up with solutions relevant for the Indian consumer, our climate and our level of incomes, said Goyal.",2017-01-23,PSxpwX4A93xUe5xycZRHfK,Power minister urges electrical equipment manufacturers to come up with innovations that suit the domestic consumer,21:38,Piyush Goyal pitches for wider use of smart electricity meters
359,-0.065425,"Bengaluru: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday conducted raids on the premises of former liquor baron Vijay Mallya-run UB Group in Bengaluru over a money laundering case against the company. 
				   
				The raids were conducted by the central division of the CBI with help from the Bengaluru division, one official from the agency confirmed. The officials were looking into various accounts of the group transactions at UB Towers in upscale Vittal Mallya Road of the city. A CBI team visited the UB Group offices in Bangalore today and we are fully cooperating with them, UB spokesperson said in a statement on Monday.

The raids come days after Mallya and his associated firms received a jolt after a debt recovery tribunal (DRT) in Bengaluru ruled in favour of public sector lender State Bank of India-led consortium to recover Rs6,203.35 crore from the former Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament (MP). Mallya flew to the UK in March last year as creditors closed in on him over unpaid and unserviced debts of his failed aviation venture Kingfisher Airlines Ltd (KFA) to the tune of over Rs9,000 crore. A court in Mumbai had declared Mallya an offender in a money laundering case in June, following a petition by the Enforcement Directorate.

356,-0.2439,"Singapore:  US oil ticked lower on Monday, falling for the first time in three sessions as prospects of rising US production weighed on the market.
				   
				US energy companies last week added the most rigs drilling for new production in almost four years. Drillers added 29 rigs in the week to 20 January, bringing the total count up to 551, the most since November 2015, energy services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday.US oil production has risen more than 6% since mid-2016, although it remains 7% below a historic high in 2015. It is back to levels of late 2014, when strong US crude output contributed to a crash in oil prices.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures was down 7 cents to $53.15 a barrel by 13.18 hours IST.Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, was little changed. It was trading at $55.48 per barrel down 1 cent from its previous close.Both Brent and WTI had traded higher earlier in the session on the back of output cuts by Opec and other producers. Production cuts by oil producers and a weaker dollar prevented the market from dropping further.Opec and non-Opec countries have made a strong start to lowering their oil output under the first such pact in more than a decade, energy ministers said on Sunday as producers look to reduce oversupply and support prices.Ministers said 1.5 million of almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) had already been taken out of the market.Oil is trading in a range, said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA brokerage in Singapore.In the medium term it is going to be tough for oil to break out. The more oil goes up, the more these shale drillers are going to hedge by the futures.Hedge funds rushed to place bullish wagers on US crude oil last week, data showed on Friday.China, which saw its crude oil imports climb to an all-time high, also exported record volumes of diesel in December, indicating an over supplied global market.The countrys December diesel exports surged 81.4% from the same month a year earlier to 1.78 million tonnes, customs data showed on Friday.The US dollar fell against the euro and yen on Tuesday after a drop in oil prices suggested US inflation would stay low and prevent the Federal Reserve from hiking interest rates at a steady pace this year.

440,-0.2452,"San Francisco: Microsoft Corp.s effort to halt the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) so-called sneak-and-peak searches of e-mails may ride on whether its allowed to defend its customers constitutional rights.
				   
				The judge who will decide whether the case can go ahead told the companys lawyers to be ready in court Monday to address earlier rulings that undercut their arguments. At stake is half of Microsofts case to block the US from secretly accessing customer data stored in the cloud, including e-mail.Microsoft drew support from tech leaders including Apple Inc., Google and Amazon.com Inc. when it sued the US justice department in April. They say the very future of mobile and cloud computing is at risk if customers cant trust that their data will remain private. The federal law allowing searches goes far beyond any necessary limits and infringes users Fourth Amendment rights against unlawful search and seizure, they contend.The justice department argues it needs such digital tools to help fight increasingly sophisticated criminals and terrorists who are savvy at using technology to communicate and hide their tracks. Disclosing the searches would undermine investigations and put Americans at risk, they argue. A decision for the US would give an early victory to President Donald Trump, who said during his campaign that he would compel technology companies to cooperate.ALSO READ: IBM touts Donald Trump-pleasing hiring plans while firing thousandsThe case may never reach that point unless Microsoft wins the argument that it has the ability to sueor standingto protect customer privacy.Rights-case barrierStanding has been a barrier in cases that seek to vindicate peoples privacy rights, said Jennifer Granick, a Stanford Law School professor. Its a serious issue in conducting constitutional litigation, and this case is no different.Four court decisions listed by US district judge James Robart in Seattle all reached the same conclusionFourth Amendment protections can only be cited by individuals, and not vicariously by third parties. The most recent was a 2014 US Supreme Court ruling that the family of a driver who was shot and killed by police after a high-speed chase couldnt invoke that right on his behalf related to a lawsuit over his death.Microsofts lawyers may have anticipated the Fourth Amendment challenge in their complaint, stating that the governments silent searches of user data have directly injured it by eroding the customer trust in the company.The industrys push against government intrusion into customers private information began in the wake of Edward Snowdens 2013 disclosures about covert data collection that put them all on the defensive.Microsoft said when it filed its lawsuit that federal courts had issued almost 2,600 secrecy orders barring it from disclosing government warrants for access to private e-mail accounts. It said more than two-thirds of those orders have no fixed end date, meaning the company can never tell customers about them, even after an investigation is completed.Free speechThe Redmond, Washington-based company concedes there may be times when the government is justified in seeking a gag order to prevent customers under investigation from tampering with evidence or harming another person. Still, the statute is too broad and sets too low of a standard for secrecy, Microsoft contends, arguing regarding the other half of its case that its own free-speech rights are being violated by the orders.ALSO READ: Donald Trump said to sign executive order on Trans-Pacific PactThe Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy group supporting Microsoft in the case, fears a ruling that the company cant sue could mean no one will ever have the right to file a data privacy lawsuit under the Fourth Amendment. The people whose privacy might be violated will never find out about the searches, said Andrew Crocker, a lawyer for the group.We obviously think that providers should be able to raise the rights of their customers, Crocker said. Otherwise youre cutting customers out of the equation when the government comes to companies with these secret gag orders.The case is Microsoft Corp. vs US department of justice, 16-cv-00538, US District Court, Western District of Washington (Seattle).

244,0.24675,"Houston: Halliburton Co. reported fourth-quarter adjusted profit that beat analysts estimates as North American shale producers lead the rest of the world into an oilfield recovery.
				   
				The worlds largest fracking services provider posted a profit excluding certain items of 4 cents a share, according to a statement Monday, exceeding the 2-cent average of 39 analysts estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales in North America rose 9%, while revenue in international markets grew 2% compared with the prior quarter.With the price of oil rising above $50 a barrel in New York, US drillers increased the number of rigs working in shale fields by 19% in the final three months of 2016. That helped spur a return to profitability for the company that helps explorers map pockets of underground oil, complete the wells and maintain output. Halliburton is expected to swing to a profit of $1.08 a share this year, according the average of 46 analysts estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Halliburton is realizing increased pricing and utilization throughout its US onshore region, analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. wrote Monday in a note to investors.Halliburton cut thousands of workers during a downturn that saw oil fall below $30 a barrel early last year, and has been pressing customers for higher prices in order to return to profitability in North America. Customers in the US and Canada boosted the number of oil and natural gas drilling rigs 19% in the final three months of the year.Despite the positive sentiment surrounding the North American land market, it is important to remember that our world is still a tale of two cycles, chief executive officer David Lesar said in the statement. The North America market appears to have rounded the corner, but the international downward cycle is still playing out.Schlumberger Ltd, the worlds largest oilfield services provider, generates most of its sales outside the US and Canada. On Friday, it reported that fourth-quarter net losses narrowed to $204 million from $1.02 billion a year earlier. Shares fell the most in more than a month.After unprecedented spending cuts over the past two years, explorers are forecast to boost capital expenditures worldwide by 7% in 2017, according to a Barclays Plc note to investors earlier this month. The US is expected to lead the rest of the world with as much as a 40% hike in exploration and production spending, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.Halliburtons fourth-quarter net loss was $149 million, or 17 cents a share, compared with a loss of $28 million, or 3 cents a share, a year earlier. Shares fell $1.82 or 3.2% to $54.63 at 10:28 am in New York after earlier sinking 4.5%, the most since 9 September.After a third-quarter operating loss in North America, Halliburton returned to profitability in its largest region with a 1.6% operating margin in the final three months of the year. They were pretty full on market utilization heading into the fourth quarter, so theres only so much more utilization you can get, Luke Lemoine, an analyst at Capital One Securities who rates the shares the equivalent of a buy and owns none, said Monday in a phone interview. With revenues up just 9% and you still have 65% incremental margin, that gives a lot of hope in what 2017 EPS could be.(Halliburton is scheduled to hold an earnings conference call Monday at 9 am New York time, accessible at EVTS.)

36,0.249675,"Ahead of his World Chess Championship (11-30 November) match against challenger Sergey Karjakin in November, defending champion Magnus Carlsen contacted Microsoft Corp. Its not that he wanted Office installed on his laptop, but he was simply seeking help to prevent hacking.
				   
				Carlsen, who relies heavily on specialised chess computers for his preparation, was worried that Russian hackers would gain access to his tactics which, in turn, could help Crimean-born Karjakin, reported The Indian Express. His fears stemmed from precedence: Russia-based hackers had broken into the World Anti-Doping Agencys website sometime back.Technology is now integral to sportand not just in malpractices like the one cited above (Carlsen retained his title). Technology is used in training, diet, recovery, clothes, shoes and in every sphere of the modern sporting world. In speed skating, an academic paper World Records: How much athlete? How much technology? suggests that half of the progress of world records has been due to changes in technologyand the other half from real athletic improvement.Three key areas have been consistently in prominence: first, the use of technology in officiating or umpiring; second, in data analysis; and third, in safety. All three play a role in driving sporting excellence and, more importantly, particularly in the world of sport, driving fans experience. It can be argued that too much reliance on science or numbers removes the element of instinct from sportone which allows M.S. Dhoni to promote himself in a World Cup cricket final or tells Stan Wawrinka to hit that backhand in the 2015 French Open tennis final. But when millimetres and fractions of seconds decide the difference between winner and runner-up, any help becomes welcome in the high intensity, competitive world of modern sport. Heres a look at how technology makes a mark in these three facets of sport.Not just line callsIn the first Test match against England in November, India were 208-1 with Cheteshwar Pujara batting on 86 when a ball bowled by Zafar Ansari hit the batsman on his leg. The umpire gave him out but Pujara, playing at home in Rajkot, asked for a review.The reconsideration decided the ball was going over the stumps and the umpires decision was revised. As the crowd roared, Pujaras wife did a little jig in the stands and two men sitting across Pujaras father shook hands, the commentator paid due credit: Thank you ICC and DRS.The Board of Control for Cricket in India has for long opposed the decision review system (DRS), citing inaccuracies in its methodology, but agreed to it on a trial basis for the five-Test series. But if a replay benefited Pujara (he went on to score a century in the first innings) it has benefited several others, too.Video replays have been used in many sports besides crickettennis, rugby, baseball and basketball, to name a fewfor different purposes. In basketball, it can be used to find out if the shot was released before the final buzzer, in baseball to handle boundary calls and in tennis/badminton whether the ball/shuttle landed inside or outside the lines. British firm Hawk-Eye, which has developed systems for many sports, uses 6-7 cameras to record the balls trajectory in tennis and puts together a three-dimensional image for officials to decide if the ball is in.Footballs governing body FIFA tried GoalControl technology during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The German-produced tech used 14 high-speed cameras and sensors mounted around the stadiumseven pointed at each goalto detect whether the ball has crossed the goal line or not. They could also combine their data into a three-dimensional format and send visual or vibration signals to the referees watch. A British firm Small Fry developed shin guards equipped with accelerometers and magnetic sensors that could reduce the number of dives in a football match. This could rob the sleep of players such as Chelseas Diego Costa.The Guardian reported other similar tools sometime back: Cairos Technologies and Adidas producing a system that uses a magnetic field to track the ball using a sensor embedded inside the ball, which detects the magnetic field produced by thin wires underneath the penalty box. Goalminder technology uses high-speed cameras built into the goal posts and crossbar to deliver visual evidence; GoalRef uses a magnetic field-based technology, too, but here the goal frame detects the passing of the ball.The International Football Association Board (IFAB) also approved testing of video technology to aid match officials (a final decision is to be taken later). The trials will allow referees to call on video assistance to help determine four categories of game-changing moments: goals scored, red cards, penalties and mistaken identity, AFP reported in March.In international sport, the stakes are very high. For instance, in the Olympics that are held once in four years, an athlete may not get a second shot at it since sporting careers tend to be brief, making margins of errors career-defining.So when Bahamas Shaunae Miller divedor fell as some have arguedat the end of the womens 400-metre race at the Rio Olympic Games in August, she lay on the track breathless for some time, as the result of the race remained unclear. It emerged later that she had beaten the favourite, Allyson Felix of the USA, to win the gold medal. The margin of victory: 0.07 seconds. The decision made by: Technology.Numbers tell how good you areOne of the best examples of using data comes from baseball, in which Oakland Athletics manager Billy Beane partnered a Yale graduate in crunching numbers and building a low-budget team of winnersimmortalized in the book Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game and a Hollywood movie. That was over a decade ago.Since then, innovations like Major League Baseballs Statcast and the National Basketball Associations SportVU systemsa system of six cameras in each arena that measures the movements of the ball and every player on the court, generating an entire database of performance informationhave leveraged data to assist coaches and players. Teams in the National Basketball Association, such as the San Antonio Spurs, have similarly used Big Data sets to help owners and coaches recruit players and execute game plans, according to the Stanford Graduate School of Business.A hand-held device called Skulpt helps improve trainingits 12 sensors, when pressed against the skin, create electric current that measures the percentage of muscle fibre versus fat stored inside the muscle. EliteForm is a technology that tracks and analyses an athletes movements while training and during games, the CNN listed in February.Niall Clark, who is the head of performance at Sachin Tendulkar co-owned Kerala Blasters, the football team in the Indian Super League, says they rely heavily on heart rate monitors and GPS. The players are given intense amount of work on certain days so they can hit specific heart rate zones and 60-70% of their individual heart rate for a maximum of 20 minutesfor recovery of homeostasis balance. GPS helps find out how much distance a player has covered, sprints he has made, accelerations and decelerationdata that help find out how the hamstring is working.GPS has also helped find that midfielders, for example, travel farther but accelerated less than players in other positions. If there is a big jump from one to other morning in the resting heart rate, we know something is wrong. Saliva helps with hormone levels, blood levels, to gauge player fitness. We havent had any muscle injuries in the season; contact injuriesyou cannot do anything about, says Clark.In certain other places, filming an athlete to gauge form and errors is passé now. Newer three-dimensional motion capture technologylike the Xbox Kinect systemsand biometric feedback on heart and respiratory rates, can give far more information, SportTechie reported.Another device, Motionize, that sends real-time information directly to an app, is a virtual coach for canoeists and kayakers. It uses two sensors, one on the boat and one on the paddle, and displays a complete view of the athletes movements on the cellphone screen.Cricket, a sport heavily influenced by statistics and datafor both performers and fansis not far behind either. Firms like CricHQwhich has the expertise of former New Zealand cricketers Stephen Fleming and Brendon McCullumCricket 21 and SportsMechanics, a sports analytics firm, crunch numbers for teams.CricHQ, which is working in conjunction with Callaghan Innovation to build the worlds best match projection engine, claims to be able to predict with a confidence interval of approximately 75% the result of any fixture in the IPL (using previous IPL data). Confidence interval is a range in which a measurement or trial falls corresponding to a given probability. We are looking to expose this engine for the 2017 IPL and hope to provide a unique experience for customers and consumers alike, says David Robertson, the companys chief data officer.Wear it, bear it for safetyIn November 2014, Australian cricketer Phil Hughes was struck by a ball on the back of his neck while batting during a first-class game. He collapsed on the pitch and died two days later. But strange as that incident may seem, it was not isolated.In recent times, at least three other people have succumbed to injuries on the cricket field: in November the same year, an Israeli umpire died after being struck on the jaw by a ball; in April 2015 a 20-year-old club cricketer died after colliding with another player in Kolkata and in July, another in England died after being struck on the chest while batting. International cricketers like Joe Root, Craig Kieswetter and Stuart Broad have suffered impact injuries in recent times, highlighting the need for on-field safety. During the same Rajkot Test, Pujara was struck thrice on his helmet.The ill-effect of force is not uniqueauthor Jeanne Marie Laskas wrote about a pathologist, Dr Bennet Omalu, who discovered that American footballers could suffer from mental deterioration caused by blows to the head. It was made into a movie last year, Concussion.NFL moved on to smart helmets, which have sensor and magnet technologysensors detect and disperse the force of collisions, while the magnet will help by spreading and absorbing the force.Since the Hughes incident and even before that, cricket has taken corrective measures, as the International Cricket Council brought in new regulations. Helmets now have a stem guard, made of thermoplastic polyurethane, to shield the back of the head and neck. It is a clip-on attachment to the side of the grille, with enhanced impact absorption, reported espncricinfo.com early this year.Over the years, other sports have modified their methods for the sake of safer practices. For example, the centre of gravity of javelins was changed to ensure they remained within existing boundaries. Amateur boxers have had to wear headgears for protection.Physiotherapist John Gloster explains how biomechanical analysis is important to correct bowling action, thereby preventing injuries. With super slow-motion, one can analyse the forces acting on the spine. Biomechanical analysis, motion analysis systems, data analysis, running analysis all of them allow to make athletes more efficient, says Gloster, who has worked with the Indian cricket team in the past and is currently the sports technical advisor for KOOH, a sports education and technology company. He also stresses the importance of sleep as a predictor and preventer of injuries. He can monitor the profile of the athlete, over the week, to predict injury. Gloster uses a hand-held dynamometer to measure muscle force and ensure the athlete has the right amount in balance with other muscles. Gloster and KOOH also work with children on fitness. This includes, as he mentions with irony, trying to encourage the child away from gadgets and technology and onto the sporting field.",2017-01-23,4fmH5PGwNRbt4J9iMrAHbO,"Technology is now integral to sport: is used in training, diet, recovery, clothes, shoes and in every sphere of the modern sporting world.",05:24,How hi-tech raises the sports bar
212,0.246825,"Mumbai: Private equity firm KKR-owned oil and gas asset management services platform Joulon has bought a majority stake in Sara Sae Pvt. Ltd, a Multiples PE portfolio company, said two people aware of the development.
				   
				Sara Sae, established in 1980, manufacturers hi-tech drilling equipment for land and jack-up rigs and other equipment used for oil well drilling. Joulon was set up by KKR in December 2015 in association with Deepak Munganahalli, an oil and gas industry veteran. Joulon aims to acquire and invest in opportunities through an integrated entity to provide asset management services to the oil and gas industry globally.The transaction has provided an exit to the Renuka Ramnath-led private equity firm Multiples Alternate Asset Management, said one of the two people cited above, requesting anonymity as he is not authorized to speak to reporters. In its first deal in 2011, Multiples had acquired a significant minority stake in Sara Sae for an undisclosed amount. According to documents filed with the Registrar of Companies (RoC), Multiples held a 46% stake in the company as of 31 March 2016. Multiples had raised its maiden $405 million fund in 2011.Joulon has acquired a controlling stake in Sara Sae through a secondary purchase of Multiples shareholding and an infusion of primary capital. Joulon has invested around Rs46 crore in the company through the primary share purchase. This capital will be used to repay part of the companys debt, said the first person cited above. The transactions value Sara Sae at around Rs220-230 crore post money, he added. Filings with RoC show that the companys profit has declined over the last three years from Rs7.4 crore in 2013-14 to Rs49 lakh in 2015-16.Emails sent Friday to Munganahalli and Joulon vice-chairman and group chief executive Abhishek Kumar went unanswered. Emails sent to Renuka Ramnath  and Multiples PE and Sara Sae promoter Vijay Kumar Dhawan too went unanswered. In December 2015, KKR announced setting up Joulon to pursue investments and investments in the oil and gas services industry. It is led by founder and chairman Munganahalli, an IIT Kanpur and Harvard Business School alumnus, who was previously associated with Transocean Ltd, one of the largest global offshore drilling contractors. The investment in the platform is being made through KKR Asian Fund II. Our goal is to become an integrated solutions provider for engineering, maintenance, repair and overhaul services for asset owners and operators in the oil and gas industry, Munganahalli had said while announcing the launch of the platform.After falling almost 37% in 2015, the Brent crude oil price gained 23.3% to $56.8 per barrel in calendar year 2016, data from Bloomberg shows. According to S&P Global Platts, oil price will continue to trend upwards and this will support increased oilfield service activity. According to Platts, US rig count will grow by an average of 131 rigs or 29% year over year during 2017.Investments in Indias oil and gas services space has not always turned to be exciting for private equity funds. In 2007, Citi Venture Capital International (now know as The Rohatyn Group) had picked up around 7% in Shiv Vani Oil and Gas for Rs102.5 crore at a price of Rs375 per share. The companys last traded share price stood at Rs2.84. Rohatyn still owns a 1.74% stake in the company, data from stock exchanges shows. Shiv Vani offers services in the field of oil and natural gas exploration and production. Last year, VCCircle reported that private equity fund Samara Capital Partners sold its entire 56.32% stake in Asian Oilfield Services Ltd to Mumbai-based energy exploration company Oilmax Energy for close to Rs30 crore at a loss of over 50%.",2017-01-23,TEkb4BL7xkGMnhOq0FN2oJ,The Joulon deal has provided an exit to Renuka Ramnaths Multiples PE from drilling equipment firm Sara Sae,04:46,KKRs Joulon buys majority stake in Sara Sae

282,0.249925,"Imagine this: you are travelling for work to London and staying in an apartment rented through Airbnb. As you hail the Uber cab for your business meeting, your phone beeps an urgent message and you swipe your finger on the fingerprint scanner to read the notification. You learn that a critical machine on your shop floor is overheating, and the message tells you that based upon previous experience, it is likely to break down soon. 
				   
				As a precautionary measure, the system has automatically sent a request to the in-house 3D printer to produce the component likely to be impacted. You pull out your Oculus from the briefcase, connect it to the app on the phone and get a visual of the machine and the impacted component. At the click of a button, the system also gives you three scenarios of the impact on the production if the machine goes down. You make the necessary phone calls using the low-cost WhatsApp and speak to the factory manager. Comforted by his response, your mind is clear for your upcoming meeting. What you have just done is leveraging mobile, next-generation security, Internet of Things (IoT), cognitive computing, natural interfaces and analytics technologies to perform a simple but critical management intervention which ensured the smooth running of your business. Welcome to your new world, Ms CEO. A tsunami of new technologies has hit the business ecosystem. The first ripples were felt in the middle of the last decade and were evidenced by the likes of Salesforce.com and that upstart called Amazon Web Services, Inc. What a curious idea it was for an e-commerce company to expose, and rent out, its underlying infrastructure to third parties! IDC predicts a third of all industry leaders will be replaced by 2020. Thats how profound the disruption is. On the consumer side, the waves intensified towards the end of the decade as social media took centre stage and e-commerce boomed in every single major economy in the world. As I write this, Facebook has nearly 1.8 billion users and Alibaba has sold $18 billion worth of products in a single day. Consumer services companies, vividly exemplifying the sharing economy, have become household brands: today, more millennials possibly identify with Uber and Airbnb than they do with venerable corporations such as Johnson & Johnson, and GE. The force of the sharing economy is reshaping vast tracts of the consumer ecosystem, effecting the closure of retail giants such as Circuit City and Woolworths, and acquisitions such as that of Starwood Hotels by Marriott.The waves are swamping those without the lifeboat of digital capabilities.The first intense wave of change came with technologies which created what IDC calls the third platform of computing. The four pillars of the third platform, namely social, mobile, analytics and cloud (SMAC), today aggregate to a market exceeding $0.5 trillion. According to IDC research, its still expected to grow in excess of 13% in 2016, taking more than 35% of overall technology spending. It accounts for 110% of the industrys growth: traditional IT spending, while still two thirds of overall spend, is shrinking at greater than 5% a year. The third platform of computing is a profound shift in the computing paradigm. Users have moved from millions to billions, devices from tens to hundreds of millions and theres enough data generated on Planet Earth to fill up the memory of a stack of Apple iPads all the way to the moon and back. SMAC technologies have transformed IT fundamentally, and opened up entirely new opportunities for businesses. From smart products to analytics businesses and from real-time system enabled mobile field forces to digital supply chains, businesses across the spectrum have embraced these in different ways to drive economic value. The maturing of the third platform of computing has enabled entirely new technologies, and combinations, to develop and mature. IDC collectively calls them the innovation accelerators, as our research identifies their potential to drive not just technology and process but also complete business disruption. Of these technologies, the following five are likely to take centre stage in India in 2017. Watch out for them.Next gen securityIf youre like me and have a continuous wrestling match with your store of forgotten capital letter-alphanumericchange-them-every-two-weeks passwords, then I can give you some comfort. The era of the complicated password will soon pass. Next generation security systems are integrating biometrics (fingerprint, voice, iris recognition) with behavioural analytics (usage location, onsite/on-app behaviour, transaction patterns) to help make bank accounts, health records, government databases and countless other stores of sensitive information ever more secure. Though not visible to most, the security of the networks our data whizzes around on, and of the data centres which power up the modern economy, is also undergoing radical modernization. For example, network security is not just about appliances detecting bad actors anymore: its moving to a managed services model where the network is monitored for bad actors, real-time responses become a reality and damage control processes kick in instantly in the event of a hack. From Apples fingerprint readers to behavioural security platforms being introduced by the likes of Intel Security and Cisco, the industry is racing to help us realize the possibilities these technologies unlock. Expect a new paradigm in security to make life easier, and more secure, for you in 2017 and beyond. Cognitive systemsThe notion of intelligent machines has fascinated man for decades. It has been the subject of Hollywood movies, science fiction books and doomsday theories. Well, theyve arrived but not in the way you thought. I must stress that intelligent machines of the current generation do not have native intelligence as humans do. They are getting smarter on the back of their ability to process vast quantities of data really fast, and identify patterns and trends to be used. Who knows what the next generation of machines brings, though?A common example is the May I help you? assistants, which have appeared on e-commerce websites. Increasingly, you are not interacting with a human but a piece of software if you do ask a question. It has been programmed with learning algorithms, and fed masses of product catalogue and user behaviour data to be able to help you. Intelligent machines are also parsing through all the published legal cases and court decisions in recorded history to help lawyers serve their clients better; and doing exactly the same with doctors trying to figure out what might be wrong with a sick patient. IBMs Watson platform is perhaps the best known in this space, but its not the only one. Google has a different approach with the TensorFlow and Google Cloud Machine Learning combination. The analytics platforms from the likes of SAS are evolving too, as are new-age data storage systems from NetApp, HP Enterprise and their peers. The year 2017 will see consumer services firms in different sectors adopting cognitive technologies more aggressively. Expect the likes of banks, e-commerce companies, telecom service providers and hospitals to deploy them faster than others. From a wider perspective, the full story will unfold in 2018-19. Internet of Things (IoT)The Internet today has enabled interactions and engagement in society in ways which were not imagined even a decade ago. Video calling through the phone at practically zero marginal cost, cloud computing which allows organizations to think at global scale without the need for massive technology investments and a plethora of consumer services at your doorstep are just three manifestations of the amazing power of the Internet.The next wave is now upon us: machines are now interacting with each other and triggering processes without human intervention. In the process, mountains of data are being generated daily, enabling machine learning and cognitive computing. This is IoT. The 2016 IDC IoT survey in India, which covered 470 companies, reveals a great enthusiasm for IoT already. Process manufacturing companies as well as logistics services and trucking firms are leading the way. The Industrial Internet is born. The year 2017 is likely to see the inflection point of IoT adoption in India. Billions of sensors will help monitor oil pipelines remotely, control home air-conditioning systems and track trucks and pallets as they move through our vast countryside. Its potential is staggering, its promise mouth-watering. It can generate crores of rupees worth of efficiencies and productivity gains in the corporate sector; for consumers, it could mean being able to switch on your air conditioner before you reach home; or your coffee machine grinding the beans when the sensors in your bedroom note that youve up.  3D printingAt a recent conference, Anand Mahindra, chairman of the Mahindra Group, shared that they had put a 3D printer in a school as part of corporate social responsibility and R&D initiatives. The group was keen to see what innovation the children might come up with if they are given the right tools. The results are awaited but early signs are promising. The term 3D printing, in some ways, is a misnomer. They are actually capital goods equipment which operate visually like printers do. In the future, this technology is likely to radically remake manufacturing. Supply chains will be disrupted and the manufacturing process for many products will be democratized, with the possibility of garage-based production and retail store production already being realized. Nikes Fly Knit shoes are made in-shop after your foot is scanned and the images sent to the 3D printer. Skin grafts have been synthesized in labs; auto parts are being 3D printed. In 2017, we will see the gradual influx of these machines into manufacturing firms, research labs and the possible odd hospital. It will take some time and price cuts before 3D printers go mainstream. But it holds much promise and would be especially useful for far-flung areas of the nation. Natural user interfacesWhat I wouldnt give to not have to get up for the remote control, and simply change the channel on the television with a swipe of my hand, or through a conveniently placed gadget that would recognize my voice and change the channel! Thats Natural User Interface (NUI) for you and its here to stay. But really, while that TV remote is still important, a lot of what we experience is now being redefined by new forms of cognitive controls. The shift from text to graphics was a major leap, courtesy of Xerox Corpo ration, and popularised by Apple with their hallmark Macintosh OS in 1984. More recently, weve witnessed a revolution of sorts in the UI space: touch (smartphones), voice (Siri) and even gesture (Microsoft Kinect, Nintendo Wii).Today consumers want amplified, immersive and authentic experiences from what they consume; NUI enables just that. The human-machine interface is fast changing our experiences, thus heralding an era of multi-touch surfaces, powerful and lightweight mobile devices and now the emerging market of wearable technology. We are entering a fascinating world sans constraints physical and virtual.On the enterprise side, firms today are increasing the connect with their ecosystem of customers, employees, suppliers and partners, moving away from mere CX (customer experience) to authentic experiences. At IDC, were seeing this extensively in media and gaming; it is a matter of time before NUI permeates retail, healthcare, fashion and automobile verticals. It is my considered view that when the neural capabilities of touch, voice and gesture and the capable hardware thats available to process these inputs (at consumer prices to boot) are coupled with the large scale APIs to leverage these NUI opportunities, a new age of platforms which can redesign and revolutionize your experience will dawn. 2017 shall be a year when the increasing clamour for experience by consumers and the omni-experience transformation needs of enterprises shall see a scaling up of investments towards this aim. As this technology transformation evolves, so too will its impact on consumer experience and the digital business ecosystem.In sum, 2017 will see the next technological revolution reshaping Indian society, business and the government landscape. Recent events have already triggered the digitalization of the payments ecosystem at warp speed. The five technologies described above, individually and in combination, will herald the dawn of the next technological age.Jaideep Mehta is managing director, IDC India and South Asia.Five trends that can change the tech world by 2021Internet-of-things (IoT) software and solutions: IoT will be driving new levels of customer insight and engagement for some by 2021, but technology diversity and the need for organizational changes will still stymie or delay many firms. Intelligent agents: Intelligent agents and related robots will have eliminated a net 6% of jobs by 2021. Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR): By 2021, AR will be commonplace, while VR will remain niche. Artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive technology: Solutions powered by AI/cognitive technology will displace jobs with the biggest impact felt in transportation, logistics, customer service, and consumer services.Hybrid wireless: 5G will be rolling out by 2021, creating a high-bandwidth cellular backbone to support IoT devices.

85,0.249825,"Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan is an assistant professor in the department of computer science and engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay. He specialises in artificial intelligence (AI) and is the only author from India who is part of an 18-member study panel of the Stanford University-hosted report titled Artificial Intelligence and Life. Kalyanakrishnans expertise broadly fits in the area of machine learning. Called reinforcement learning, it defines what actions software agents should take to maximize a certain type of reward after learning from reward and punishment. In an interview, he urges people to be more optimistic about the things AI can do rather than be obsessed with the fear around AI machines. Edited excerpts:
How was the Stanford AI report conceived? How did you get involved?In the last 5-10 years, the public has been forced to take notice of AI. You do searches, for instance, and get the information you want. You can talk to your phone using Apples Siri. There is so much intelligence in your car. Everywhere, intelligent software is assisting you in your lifestyle in a very noticeable way. The common mans perception is that AI is taking away jobs. Jobs that people used to do about 10 years back have been replaced either partially or even fully in some cases by software and hardware developments. This triggered the conversation, which led to experts being asked about their opinion of where AI is heading and what can be done about it.In the last few months, there have been some alarmist views, even by physicist Stephen Hawking. Moreover, even a person like Elon Musk, who is responsible for taking technology forward with his ventures like Tesla and SpaceX, has expressed similar sentimentsthat things could go awfully wrong once we have AI doing actions that human beings traditionally have done.Eric (Horvitz, a computer scientist and technical fellow at Microsoft) has been with Microsoft Research and is primarily responsible for this report. He decided that we needed a more sober assessment of AInot based on emotions but one that is more rigorous and scientific. We will have a study panel every five years. This is the first one. I was chosen by Peter (Peter Stone, professor at the department of computer science, University of Texas) because the study panel was looking at diversity in age, gender and geography. This came together in May 2015, and we were given a year to do this. As a group, we agreed that it is true that AI is game-changing, that it is moving at a fast pace. Hence, we did not forecast beyond 2030, because it is not scientific to do so when there is so much uncertainty about the concept.Can you list some of these uncertainties?Look back to 1995. I dont think it was possible way back then to predict accurately some of the things that we have today. The Internet has happened, so have smartphones and social networks. Its the nature of science and technology which makes it difficult to predict beyond a certain period. There are just too many variables.What was your contributions to the AI report?My contribution was more to define AI. We take intelligence for granted in human beings. We expect people to be able to do certain tasks, to answer questions meaningfully etc. So what are the operating principles that define intelligence? How is it constructed? What are its mathematical foundations? We have asked these questions earlier too, and even in the 70s we had automata (a machine which performs a range of functions according to a predetermined set of coded instructions).For instance, you still have churches where clocks do specific tasks (for example, birds chiming) when their gongs strike midnight. The confluence of software and mathematics really took place in the 1950s when computers became available. We had the Eniac (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) which was built during the war (World War II), and it became possible to build computer systems that could exhibit intelligence. So technically speaking, the first such computer systems were aimed at helping soldiers during the Warused to calculate things like the trajectory of a missile; planning logistics, etc. This explains why DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) has been funding computer science in general and AI for a long time. But the pioneers of AI have also been thinking about AI in scientific terms. Scientists like Alan Turing, who can be considered to be the fountainhead of AI despite the fact that he did not have access to real hardware, was one (such, who was),  thinking about writing a programme to play chess.So what exactly is AI?The term was coined only in 1956 in a workshop (Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence) put together by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon and Nathaniel Rochester. So you can think of AI as a branch of computer science but it is multidisciplinary: it has constant inputs from psychologists, linguists, roboticists, etc. You know intelligence when you see it. But how do you get an artificial agent to show intelligence? Most people would consider a machine to be endowed with AI if it performs like a human being. You can think of examples like Google search or Google Maps. Computers can play chess, which was the holy grail of AI, and now even beat grandmasters. We think of intelligence as a spectrum that is constantly being propelled forward. And AI is what can do this. In some sense, AI is this desire to replicate intelligence in hardware. It is also, in a strange sense, the sum total of what an AI researcher is doingsomething in robotics, NLP (natural language processing), etc. AI does not have a rigid definition. Hence we went with (Nils J.) Nilssons definition in the AI report (AI is that activity devoted to making machines intelligent, and intelligence is that quality that enables an entity to function appropriately and with foresight in its environment).What does the AI concept comprise?The broad architecture of an intelligent agent is one that senses the environment, which does some amount of thinking, and then takes actions in the real world. If you consider sensing, there is the whole area of Computer Vision, which tries to make sense of objects we see. We, then, have the field of speech processing that has to do with audio. When you go to actuation, you have fields like robotics, haptics, etc. AI also comprises machine learning, knowledge representation and logic. Humans typically make changes to their behaviour as they learn from experiences. So if the experience that a programme undergoes somehow changes its behaviour, you can say that the programme is applying machine learning. Now we have data-driven machine learning. Consider the case of hospitals gathering patient datavital parameters like blood sugar level, age, gender, blood pressure, etc. Now lets presume the hospital has collected this data for, say, 1,000 patients and diagnosed diabetic patients from this lot. A machine learning algorithm can then sift through this data and learn a predictor and predict whether a new patient (whose body parameters are available) is diabetic or not. Similar is the case with Google search that has moved from also displaying irrelevant links to using machine learning algorithms that have refined this task over the last few years.The technical base for designing machine learning systems comes primarily from streams like probability and statistics. Then we have NLP, which is the most natural. By speaking natural languages that is quite different from the language that computers use to communicate (1s and 0sbits and bytes), NLP has got to a state when you can take a shot at machine translation. The basic building blocks for NLP comprise actual models of languages. The linguistic hierarchy of language begins with syntax, moving on to semantics (study of relationships between words and how we construct meaning) and later, pragmatics (e.g. you can use sarcasm, punstypically where you need an understanding of culture and context). Anyone dealing with NLP has to know these branches.What about Deep Learning?Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) aim to simulate the human brain. They can be used to map inputs to predictions. There are standard learning algorithms to train ANNs based on data. Neural networks have been around for almost three decades but it was very difficult to train large and deep (with more layers) neural networks. Technically, they get stuck in the so-called Local Minimum (defined as the best solution to a problem within a small neighbourhood of possible solutions as opposed to the concept of global optimum, which is the optimal solution when every possible solution is considered). Ironically, you do need ANNs with many layers. Deep Learning helps us to successfully train larger ANNs.Will true AI ever be achieved?This has divided researchers over the decades. Most people in the AI community subscribe to the view that it does not really matter if machines are exactly replicating what human beings can do, as long as we do things that are intelligent and of value. For example, we have software that can fly an aircraftvery differently from how a human being would do it but it is doing it nevertheless.What are the challenges? Explaining AI to the public itself is a challenge. That said, can inputs be automatically learnt or combined in ways that can give higher level abstractions, to make the task of prediction easier? In the context of vision, the inputs to computer vision systems is just images (matrix of 0s and 1s). But deep learning algorithms are able to abstract things out like edges, boundaries, locations of objects, etc. You can have a deep learning system to autonomously drive a car. The software agent needs to reason about stop signs, etc., (and) not only about camera images; it has to learn a host of features from scratch. The other challenge is that hardware needs to match the pace of development in software. The brain also uses less energy than the chips that we are building today, which are simulating our neurons using a different architecture that generates a lot of heat. Hence, there is a move to develop specialized hardware using a neural architecture as opposed to the traditional Von Neumann architecture. If this becomes a reality a decade from now, we will be able to do a lot more with neural networks than we can now. Not only does a neural network need to be good at its task, it should also be energy efficient.There is a lot of scare-mongering around AI. What is your perspective on this issue?People are driven a lot by what they see in movies. Part of the common persons concern is around the Frankenstein that will do nasty things. The fact is that AI is beginning to work in very specialized tasks like controlling an airplane or driving your car. Its hard to think of any general AI machine that can do all of these tasks in unisonclearly something that humans excel at. As far as AI machines are concerned, this is certainly not on the horizon for at least the next 15-20 years. This scare is unfounded. But the fear that certain types of jobs will vanish because AI (software bots and machines) will do it more efficiently is genuine. Policy makers should prepare themselves for this, and proactively retrain and reskill the people who will be affected to help them cope better with the situation.",2017-01-23,BTmqgM825lBVJvZGYCMz9H,IIT Bombay professor Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan urges people to be more optimistic about the things artificial intelligence can do,05:29,AI is the desire to replicate intelligence in machines: Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan
53,0.24205,"Mumbai: The central bank is working on setting up a financial sector resolution corporation, said N.S. Vishwanathan, deputy governor, Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
				   
				We have discussed with the government the shape this corporation will take. Its purpose is to not only provide insurance to financial companies but also to provide resolution, Vishwanathan said at the Mint Annual Banking Conclave.The deputy governor said that while non-financial sector companies had the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to deal with resolution, the proposed corporation is likely to help protect financial sector companies.In September 2016, a panel set up by the government had released a draft law on financial sector resolution. This draft had suggested setting up a corporation to manage resolution. And it had also said that once the Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill, 2016 was enacted, the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) could be dissolved and all its functions passed on to the new corporation.Vishwanathan pointed out that the regulator had already put in place measures to de-risk bank balance sheets by reducing excessive exposure to large corporate accounts.We are also using this to develop the capital market. Banks will have to find different ways of using their funds, he said.In December 2016, RBI said that it would cap banks exposure to a group of connected companies at 25% of the lenders core capital, seeking to reduce concentration risk in a banking industry laden with bad loans.The central bank lowered the limit from 40% of the banks total capital funds, which include both Tier 1 (core) and Tier 2 capital, and gave banks until 2019 to meet the new norms.In the case of an individual company, this limit would be changed to 20% of Tier 1 capital, compared with 15% of total capital funds currently, RBI had said.The deputy governor said that while stressed loans were something that the banking sector was grappling with, the setting up of the Central Repository for Information on Large Credit (CRILC) was helping them gather more information and take better calls while resolving stress.RBI is also looking at the financial technology space and assessing the impact that it could have on various kinds of financial services.We need to make exploratory efforts on what needs to be regulated, how it will be regulated in a way that innovation is not undermined, Vishwanathan said.We have a multi-regulatory working group that we have put in place to look at the entire gamut of issues that are affecting the industry and hopefully will get their report soon, he added.",2017-01-23,7MPtvBBSDuHfH4czTZfcdL,"RBI deputy governor N.S.

382,0.24635,"Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltds (RIL) third-quarter report card may not have had the stock market excited, but the energy company expects its gross refining margins (GRMs) to stay in double digits going forward. 
				   
				GRM is what a refiner  earns from turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel. RIL announced its third-quarter results on 16 January. During the quarter, RIL's GRMs stood at $10.8 per barrel, against $10.1  in the second quarter and $11.5  a year ago. Though it reported a $4.1 per barrel premium to Singapore complex margins, it was the lowest in the past three quarters. Singapore GRMs came in at $6.74 per barrel. This is our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit GRMs and double-digit GRMs are good, said Srikanth Venkatachari, Reliances joint chief financial officer, after the companys  earmings conference. Srikanth added that he sees the GRMs sustained at these levels going forward. As a refinery, we are seeing a demand growth for products. The underlying demand trends are good. When you look at the demand for refined products and the supply for the same, clearly, demand outstrips supply. Our own outlook is that we continue to think that the refining environment is in a good spot. (RIL) Management expects GRM to remain strong as net refining capacity addition of 5 million barrels of oil per day (mbpd) over the next five years will lag demand growth of 6 mbpd. In the medium term too, fuel demand growth of 1.3 mbpd in CY2017 shall surpass refining capacity addition, thereby keeping margins firm. Also, strong demand growth from Asia (especially India and China) and refinery closures in Europe will support GRM, said Axis Capital in its research report dated 17 January.Refining and marketing and petrochemicals form over 95% of RILs profit. RIL reported a 3.6% increase in its consolidated net profit at Rs7,506 crore for the three months ended 31 December from Rs7,245 crore a year earlier. Consolidated revenue came in at Rs 84,189 crore against Rs 72,513 crore a year earlier. Goldman Sachs in a report dated 17 January said it expects RILs refining margins to outperform peers. The company refined 17.8 million tonnes of crude oil during the quarter, lower than the 18 million tonnes  a year earlier, following a five-week shutdown at a catalytic cracking unit. The company operates two refineries in Gujarat, with a combined capacity of 1.24 million barrels a day. RILs two refineries in Jamnagar help it process cheaper crude, boosting its refining margins. RIL, which has invested heavily in expansion of its core projects, will see the expansion paying off from FY18. Analysts expect GRMs to be boosted by $0.7-$0.9 per barrel by the commissioning of the expansion of its core projects.  ""RILs grandiose $50 billion capex programme is nearing completion and will effectively double its gross block by FY18 estimated. About 35% of the overall capex was incurred towards core businessesrefining, petrochemicaloff as cracker ($5bn); petcoke gasification ($5bn); and US ethane imports ($1.5bn) are on track for commissioning from January 20117 to end CY17.These should further enhance GRMs and petrochemical margins,"" said Edelweiss Securities Ltd in its report dated 16 January.  Investment in petcoke gasification will help RIL meet its entire fuel requirement at the refineries and eliminate its petcoke production of 6.5 million tonnes a year, generated from two of its cokers. The technology for petcoke gasification will help RIL produce 23 mscmd (million standard cubic metres a day) of syngas and will aid in reducing R-LNG (regasified liquefied natural gas) intake for its refineries.  In the analyst meet, the company highlighted plans to raise the utilization rate for its downstream refining units, which along with term contracts on heavy crude, should help cushion the impact from potential reduction in crude discounts. The company highlighted its flexibility to move product yields by 10-15% which we believe should support GRMs as we see diesel margins outperforming gasoline in 2017,"" said Morgan Stanley in its report dated 17 January.",2017-01-24,rJaSLjQgZUrrwefo1NcxRO,GRM is what a refiner  earns from turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel ,10:28,RIL hopes its double-digit GRM will continue to hit the sweet spot

206,0.247575,"Mumbai: The board of Indias biggest cigarette maker ITC Ltd will on Friday consider a proposal to split the post of chairman between non-executive chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) in a move that could hand the companys reins to chief operating officer Sanjiv Puri effective 5 February.
				   
				In June last year, ITC said its chairman Y.C. Deveshwar would step down as executive chairman at the end of his term in February, but he would continue as non-executive chairman for at least three more years. Within a month of that announcement, ITC appointed Puri as chief operating officer, giving the first clear indication that he was the front runner to succeed Deveshwar as CEO.After more than two decades at the companys helm, Deveshwar will become a mentor to a new leadership at the diversified conglomerate, which also has interests in hotels and consumer packaged goods, a spokesperson for ITC said on Tuesday.The company said in a regulatory filing that Puri, who became an executive director in December 2015, will take over as CEO if the proposal is approved by the boards nomination and compensation committee.ITCs board will meet on Friday to approve the companys December quarter results. It will be the last board meeting that Deveshwar will chair as CEO of the company. During his term, which started in 1996, he was responsible for the diversification of ITC, which initially focused on cigarettes alone. He is now credited with transforming ITC.The dominant question when he took over was whether to focus (on the core business of cigarettes) or to diversify, said an ITC veteran, who asked not to be identified. The advice was to focus, but Deveshwar as the chairman dealt with the problem differently. He chose to focus as well as diversify by creating an enabling management structure that helped harness skills to do both, this person added.Last year, ITC said that under Deveshwars 20-year leadership, the companys revenue had grown from Rs5,200 crore to Rs51,500 crorealmost a 10-fold jumpwhile generating shareholder returns of 23.3%, compounded annually. Not surprisingly, ITCs board tried to persuade Deveshwar, who is turning 70, to carry on as the chief executive but he decided to put in place a youthful leadership at the helm in the longer term interest.Puri, 54, has been with ITC for more than three decades. An alumnus of Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, he oversaw a large portfolio of businesses starting December 2014. For a year till his elevation to the board as an executive director, Puri was ITCs president (fast-moving consumer goods), overseeing the companys interests in cigarettes, food and personal care products, among other key segments.In an interview with Mint in September last year, Puri said that he would follow Deveshwars footsteps to ramp up revenue from consumer goods other than cigarettes to Rs1 trillion by 2030a target set by his predecessor. This segment, which clocked Rs9,704 crore in revenue in fiscal 2016, presents for ITC the maximum potential to grow, Puri said, indicating plans to take the business abroad after scaling it up locally.",2017-01-24,SVUUtIrntx7OI5z8ExWrMK,ITC  plans to split the post of executive chairman and CEO after Y.C.

				Given the ambiguity around demonetization, this beat has come as a surprise since the Street was working with a lower number. A Bloomberg poll of 18 analysts had estimated a net profit of Rs3,770.8 crore. Shares of the private sector lender gained nearly 2% after earnings were announced on Tuesday. HDFC Banks loan growth was up 13.45% year-on-year in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 (Q3FY17), but lower than the 18.1% growth reported in Q2FY17. Loan growth in the quarter gone by was anticipated to take a hit due to outflows on account of FCNR (foreign currency non-repatriable) deposits redemption and SME (small and medium enterprises) repayments. Also, low-cost deposits were expected to be strong due to the demonetization exercise. The banks total deposits grew 21.1% year-on-year to Rs6.35 trillion in the quarter gone by.Net interest margin (NIM), which has been hovering in the 4.2-4.4% range for the past many quarters, moderated to 4.1% in Q3FY17.

This was aided by a 46.7% rise in first year premium to Rs1,780 crore.However, the companys management expenses for the December quarter increased by around 19.2% year-on-year to Rs754.61 crore primarily due to an increase in employees remuneration and a 34% jump in net commission paid.

From a ratio angle The expenses are more or less in line with our topline growth, said Sandeep Batra, executive director, ICICI Prudential Life.The company also posted an investment loss of Rs665.19 crore in the December quarter compared to a net income of Rs1,656 crore a year ago. This was primarily due to losses incurred on investments made under linked life insurance policies (Rs837.1 crore) and linked pension policies. This is not really a loss but it is a part of the linked business whose net asset values (NAVs) keep fluctuating.

425,0.248925,"London/ Melbourne: Rio Tinto Group moved closer to an exit from thermal coal after the worlds second-biggest miner agreed to sell most of its mines to a company controlled by Chinas Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. for $2.45 billion. Shares in both companies rose on Wednesday.
				   
				The sale, which includes Rios biggest Australian coal operation in the Hunter Valley region, leaves the company with only two producing coal mines in the country that was once the cornerstone of its energy business.It was kind of getting to the point where thermal was irrelevant, theyre an iron ore, copper, aluminum and industrial-minerals business, said Richard Knights, a mining analyst at Liberum Capital Ltd. in London. Now is a fantastic time to offload coal assets.Thermal coal prices surged last year after China introduced mining restrictions. Output by the worlds biggest producer and consumer of the fuel fell 9.4% in 2016, while imports reversed two years of declines to gain 25%, the biggest increase since 2012. Australias Newcastle coal, an Asian thermal benchmark, surged more than 80% in 2016, snapping five years of declines.Rio advanced 3.1% to A$66.76 a share by 1.31pm in Sydney, after closing at the highest since March 2015 on Tuesday. Yanzhou Coal Mining gained 0.7% to HK$5.89, after jumping the most in six weeks on Tuesday.The deal is the first major transaction by Rio under chief executive officer Jean Sebastien Jacques, who took over from Sam Walsh in July. Prior to being made CEO, Jacques headed the copper business. A company restructuring in 2015 led to coal being incorporated into the unit led by him.Payment termsThe sale to Yancoal Australia Ltd. is subject to Australian government approval and includes an initial $1.95 billion cash payment and $500 million in annual installments of $100 million following completion.Yancoal, which is 13% owned by Asian commodity trading giant Noble Group Ltd, said Tuesday the acquisition would make it Australias largest pure-play producer of the commodity. Chinese state-owned Yanzhou Coal owns 78% of the Australian Securities Exchange-listed company.Yancoal Australia jumped as much as 4.2% to 50 Australian cents, while Noble Group gained 0.6% to 17.4 Singapore cents.Yancoal will also make an offer to Mitsubishi Development Pty, which owns a 32.4% stake in the Hunter Valley coal assets, according to the statement Tuesday. Mitsubishi Corp. is considering whether or not to sell its share in the mine, said a spokesman who declined to elaborate and asked not to be identified, citing company policy. The parent added 0.6% to 2,601.5 yen in Tokyo trading.Rio has sold at least $7.7 billion in assets since 2013 as it sought to weather a downturn in commodities sparked by Chinas slowing growth and a glut of raw materials. It has been shedding Australian coal assets since dismantling its energy division in 2015.Other businessesAfter divesting its Mount Pleasant project and completing the sale of a 40% stake in the Bengalla venture to New Hope Corp. last year, the sale of its Coal & Allied Industries Ltd. unit to Yancoal leaves Rio with the Hail Creek and Kestrel mines, both of which are primarily producers of coking coal, used to make steel. The two mines produced a combined 8.1 million metric tons of coking coal and about 3.7 million tons of thermal coal last year.Rios coal business was already dwarfed by output from operations such as iron ore and aluminum, with the unit contributing less than 10% of its $34.8 billion in sales for 2015. Rio will report 2016 earnings on 8 February.The sale wont have a material impact on earnings per share, the miner said.Its retreat from coal comes against a backdrop of investor and regulatory scrutiny on the potential for untapped fossil fuel assets to be left stranded as governments adopt stricter climate change policies. Norways $870 billion sovereign wealth fund, the largest of its type in the world, last year moved to ban investment in companies that base at least 30% of their business on coal or revenue from the fuel.The sale may be a boon for Rio investors in the form of future dividends, Liberums Knights suggested.I dont think theyre going to be hoarding the cash, he said. They are making a tremendous amount of cash at the moment. Theyre likely to pay a dividend at the top end of the guidance and theres clearly scope for a decent sized special dividend. Rio said its shareholders will be required to vote on the transaction because Yancoal is considered a related party due to the fact Aluminum Corp. of China, which is also state-owned, is a 10% shareholder in Rio.

				Many pro-demonetisation economists and analysts had in the early days of the move claimed at least 20% of the Rs15.55 trillion of cancelled money would not come back to the system, which in turn, could enable the RBI to write off that amount from its balancesheet. The profit accretion could then be transferred to the government by the RBI as surplus transfer. While the central bank had publicly cited only Rs15.55 trillion of high value notes were cancelled on 8 November, in an RTI reply to PTI, it had said the actual quantum of bills cancelled was much higher at Rs20.51 trillion. ALSO READ: No records of fake currency deposited in banks: RBIBut according to a report by domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal, this could just be a whimper of the initial projection at Rs40,000 crore, which means only around 3.5% of the cancelled money was not returned to the system or were black money. The brokerage said while RBI has not provided any data on deposited notes after 10 December, calculations using official data on currency in circulation and total supply of bills by 19 December show that over Rs15 trillion has come back to the system. Thus, the RBI could transfer a maximum of Rs40,000 crore to the government, which will be included in the latters non-tax revenue receipts for the next fiscal, the report said. Additional taxes worth Rs32,800 crore and non-tax revenue of Rs40,000 crore will add Rs72,800 crore to the governments kitty next year, it said. But this is based on the broking firms assessment of the cancelled money which came back to the system till 19 December. So far, neither the RBI nor the government has quantified the money that came back to the system. As per the brokerages estimates, the income tax department may be able to unearth only Rs28,500 crore as black money, representing 50% of the income considered to be declared under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana scheme.

328,0.243275,"Unilever Plc, the Anglo-Dutch parent of Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), said challenging conditions in India and Brazil, two of its largest markets, had crimped its earnings last year. 
				   
				The companys 2016 revenue declined 1% to 52.7 billion. Net profit rose 5.5% to 5.5 billion. The Indian unit contributes a little less than 10% of overall revenue and a little more than 10% of profit.We have delivered another good all-round performance despite severe economic disruptions, particularly in India and Brazil, two of our largest markets, Paul Polman, Unilevers CEO, said in a conference call with investors on Thursday. Unilever attributed the poor performance of its Indian unit to demonetisation (India scrapped old high-value currency notes on 8 November).

The consumer goods giant also expects the March quarter performance to be soft. Restocking will start by February and March, and it will be April as we come out of this, Polman said.To be sure, the maker of Knorr soups, Surf detergents and Lux soaps had mentioned the tepid performance of its Indian unit even in the September quarter as costlier inputs forced HUL to raise prices of some skincare products, affecting  sales.Sales (in terms of volume) at the Indian subsidiary have now shrunk for two quarters in a row. In September, HUL reported a 1% decline in sales volume, the first in 30 quarters. The decline in December was even sharper at 4% because of demonetisation, which also affected the wholesale trade that is largely cash-dependent. The India business may continue to face headwinds in the short term from the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) which may come into effect starting 1 July. We have to see what the consequences are (of GST) as we work our way through to it, Polman said, although he recognized that GST will benefit the firm in the long term.In the December quarter, HULs net profit rose 6.83% to Rs1,037.9 crore, boosted by a one-time gain from the sale of properties. Revenue fell 1.24% from a year ago to Rs8,226.5 crore. The fall in revenue was lower than the volume decline as the firm raised prices of some personal care and home care products, mainly due to commodity price increases; palm oil and crude oil prices have risen sharply.

76,0.243925,"New Delhi: Indias biggest solar power project has stalled as the state which sought bids from generators says it cant buy the energy at prices it had agreed upon.
				   
				Winning developers in Jharkhand state are still waiting to sign power purchase agreements almost a year after the tender. In March, Jharkhand awarded contracts to build 1.2 gigawatts (GW) of solar. The states power retailer, Jharkhand Bijli Vitran Nigam Ltd, was supposed to sign the power purchase agreements in May 2016.We have asked for financial assistance of a few hundred crore rupees from the states finance department and are awaiting their response, said R.K. Srivastava, chief secretary of the energy department in the state of Jharkhand.The delay underscores the threat from financially strapped state power retailers to Prime Minister Narendra Modis ambitious renewable energy goals. State-owned power retailers in India had combined losses of Rs3.84 trillion as of March 2015, according to a report by KPMG.Jharkhand Bijlis managing director, Rahul Kumar Purwar, couldnt be reached for comment.ReNew Power Ventures Pvt.

An email sent to the Adani Group wasnt returned. OPG Power executives couldnt be reached. In an email, ReNew Power executives declined to comment.Solar auctionHow much of the solar capacity awarded in Marchs tender eventually gets built depends on whether the government provides the backing, Srivastava said.Tariffs awarded in the auction ranged from Rs5.08 to Rs7.90 per kilowatt-hour depending on the size of the project, all of which were supposed to become operational between May and November this year.There is a huge difference between the average tariff of nearly Rs4.3 a unit, at which the discom buys power, and the rates quoted for solar energy in the auction last year, Srivastava said in a phone interview, referring to the term used to identify electricity distribution companies in India.The poor financial health of the countrys power retailers has been identified as one of the biggest hurdles to Modis climate pledge to install 175 GW of renewable capacity by 2022.Those losses mean discoms cant buy more electricity to satisfy expected demand whether clean or conventional, nor can they add more customers. That ultimately leaves latent power demand unmet.Several domestic and overseas clean energy companies have said they havent received payments for the electricity they generate for more than 10 months, racking up deficits of several hundred million dollars that may put the countrys green power ambitions at risk.Jharkhands state discom has liabilities of Rs6,400 crore, according to government data.

10,0.249225,"Bengaluru: Abidali Neemuchwala completes a year on 1 February as Wipro Ltds chief executive officer (CEO). The former Tata Consultancy Services Ltd veteran, who joined Wipro as chief operating officer (COO) in April 2015, remains confident that by the end of March 2018, Wipro will be able to come back to industry-matching growth.
ALSO READ | Wipro revenue forecast underlines IT industrys challengesOver his 20 months at Wipro, Neemuchwala, who is based in Dallas, has focused on simplifying internal processes, worked on organization alignment to improve execution, embraced hyper automation and adopted an aggressive mergers and acquisitions approach. The measures have helped Wipro marginally improve upon the 3.7% dollar revenue growth recorded in 2015-16, which is  expected to grow at-best 5% in the year ending March. Edited excerpts from an interview:Three full quarters as CEO, and you have embarked on a journey by articulating six broad themes. Given these measures you have started, the management has said in the past that a complete turnaround will take time. Will it be fair to ask if the company can come back or say end March 2018 with industry-matching growth or Nasscom-projected growth numbers? How would you describe this quarter?Operationally, it was a good quarter. Our profitability improved in a quarter where there are furloughs and fewer working days. But I think in revenue growth we could have done more. But core business is doing well. India and Middle East business restructuring (had an impact) and Appirio (acquisition) closing also took time. So these things aside, Im very confident that Wipro is progressing well and I believe three-four quarters is a reasonable time frame (when we will come back to Industry-leading growth). You need all cylinders to be firing for industry-leading growth and that is what Im focusing on. One criticism of your 20-month stint, first as COO and then the 10 months as CEO, is that you have shied away from taking tough decisions when it comes to making or appointing leaders. Analysts believe you have continued with the same set of leaders. One of the things which is part of my nature is that we dont advertise tough decisions. As a CEO, you take tough decisions all the time. About 40% of my current leadership team, from direct reporting structure, is not what I inherited from T.K. Kurien. We have new leadership where ever it is required. (What) Im also very sensitive about is that whenever these changes happen, we do it very respectfully and consciously. So we dont make changes for the heck of making changes. In fact, I feel very good that if you as a journalist dont see this change, then customers also dont see this change. And this is the best thing for us. Remember, we have had a very smooth CEO transition, or rather the smoothest in the industry. Do you think there is a lot of noise on visa regulation in the US and Indian companies dependence on visas is actually coming down?Absolutely. The industry, including Wipro, has learnt to hire globally, many more local employees. Rebadged a lot of employees from our customers. Today I guide my hiring managers that dont make overseas job posting as an attraction. That era is over. So today I tell young talent that if you want to do great digital and path breaking and domain focused work, join Wipro. So dependence on visa has absolutely come down over the last few years. And so it is not that much of a worry because we believe that all business friendly decisions will be taken by the US government. What are say two challenges ahead of you, as you start calendar year 2017?Strategically, we have to future-proof our organization. So execution here will be key. Our exposure to telecoms and energy in the past had its impact. So balancing the whole portfolio takes time. We have to configure our business that we are diversified enough so that cyclical changes do not have more than impact.Now India and Middle East is creating new opportunities. Historically, we have had challenges. So we plan to complete in two quarters. So we hope to complete by Q1 of next financial year.

82,0.2483,"Dallas: Clear, the biometric screening firm long hobbled by a limited network, is landing in several major US airports soon, including New Yorks LaGuardia, marking the start of an era that could radically accelerate your trip from curb to cabin. But there are some bumps to smooth out first.
				   
				Clear, which started at JFK International Airport earlier this month, will open screening lanes at LaGuardia and Atlantas Hartsfield-Jackson in the next few days, followed by Los Angeles International and Minneapolis-St. Paul by April. All told, the expansion will put Clear at 22 major airports, covering the majority of domestic American flights, according to the company.Clear doesnt replace TSA PreCheck so much as complement it. It checks travellers identities with a fingerprint or iris scan, eliminating the boarding pass and identity checks. That lets Clear members proceed directly to bag and body screening. The company says about 65% of its users at the busiest airports have also enrolled in PreCheck, allowing them to retain their shoes, belts, and laptops during the screening.Clear is a reincarnation of the verified-identification idea begun by journalist Steven Brill in 2003. That company ran out of money and shut down in 2009. It was purchased in bankruptcy the following year for about $6 million by investors including Clears current CEO, former hedge fund manager Caryn Seidman-Becker. Other stakeholders include T. Rowe Price Group Inc., Sterling Equities, investor Bill Miller, and former executives of Priceline Group Inc. (Clear also offers security checks at various professional sports arenas.)The New York-based company, in which Delta Air Lines Inc. holds a 5% stake, has been working hard to expand its network to the point where veteran air travelers would view it as comprehensive. Glaring omissions at some major hubs, such as Chicago OHare and Newark Liberty, have made some frequent fliers disinclined to consider paying for the service. In order to provide the best service and to meet the expectations of our members, we have to be in all the right airports, said David Cohen, Clears chief administrative officer. Thats really important. There are other obstacles still facing Clear. Its lanes, for one, arent always located in the same terminals that have the bulk of an airports traffic.At both Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston-Bush airports, for example, Clears lanes are in terminals not used by the dominant carriers at those hubs, American Airlines Group Inc. and United Continental Holdings Inc., respectively. Cohen said each airport has different needs and requirements about where Clear can establish screening.Clear charges $179 annually, with new enrollees receiving a one-month trial for free. The company has also experimented with a variety of pricing promotions, such as $29 for a three-month enrolment last summer. Members of Deltas SkyMiles frequent flier program get discounted memberships, while Delta covers the cost for its top-level elite members. Clear members can add a spouse or domestic partner for $50, and children 17 and younger are free.Clear says it has more than 700,000 members nationwide and will surpass 1 million in the next few months, with annual enrollment growth of 110%.If Clear reaches critical mass and becomes a viable option for all who wish to enroll, it may face a bigger problem: success. More travelers using Clear may spell longer queues at airports that already face space constraints. Isnt Clear useful to its customers precisely because its audience is limited? Cohen said the company hasnt yet faced this problem, even as it processes upwards of 2,000 travelers each day at its busiest locations. And the tech firm has an advantage when it comes to that issue, he said: By using technology like automated kiosks, it can expand without hiring more employees.

40,0.249375,"The December quarter was expected to be a tough one for Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd, as advertisers cut spending in response to demonetisation. 
				   
				That was expected to show in the companys performance in the quarter, which it did, but the big surprise was on the profitability front. Its Ebitda of Rs515.8 crore was much higher than the Streets estimates. For instance, Kotak Institutional Equities and Edelweiss Securities Ltd were expecting the Ebitda at Rs430 crore. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.ALSO READ | Zee Entertainments profit up 8.6% at Rs250.8 croreA decline in costs led to this improvement, as overall revenue growth was just 3.4% compared to a year ago. Other expenses,  and advertising and publicity expenses declined.Coming to the advertising performance, Zee Entertainments consolidated ad revenue, accounting for 58% of total revenue, rose 3.4% year-on-year for the December quarter. In comparison, it had increased 15.7% and 19%, respectively, in the September and June quarters.According to the company, advertising revenue growth during the first 40 days of the quarter, i.e. pre-demonetisation, was similar to the growth seen in the half year ended September. What offers some comfort is that Zee Entertainments December quarter ad revenue performance was better than some analysts expectations. For instance, Kotak and Edelweiss were expecting ad revenue growth of 2% and 1%, respectively.Subscription revenue, accounting for 36% of total revenue, increased 13.7%, helped by closure of content deals with a few large distribution platform operators during the quarter. Subscription revenue included some catch-up revenues for the previous quarters. After a good quarter, much depends on how advertising shapes up. According to Mihir Modi, chief finance and strategy officer at Zee Entertainment, while advertising growth is better than November and December, it hasnt gone back to pre-demonetisation days.For the next six-eight months, Modi expects telecom and auto sectors to give impetus to advertising growth. The push from the telecom sector will be driven by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd while automobile launches will boost auto sector growth.Zee Entertainments shares have outperformed the benchmark Sensex so far this fiscal year. But more recently, the stock has been hit by the demonetisation blow. From a closing high of Rs579 in early October, the stock has declined 14% till now. Currently, one share trades at 30 times estimated earnings for the next fiscal year.

298,0.248475,"The next big challenge for Indian law firms will be how to make the best use of technology and how to motivate their human resources, Cyril Shroff, managing partner of Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, said in an interview as he looks back at the history of a firm that is 100 years old. Indias largest law firm, Amarchand and Mangaldas and Suresh A. Shroff  and Co.s Delhi and Mumbai regions, managed by brothers Shardul and Cyril Shroff, respectively, agreed to split into two firms in 2015.  Edited excerpts:
Amarchand Mangaldas has completed 100 years. How has it progressed institutionally and what is the way forward?It is an inflexion point in our journey. It gives us the moral authority and stature, as an organization, to reflect on the past and chart the future. It has been a truly rich and long history that started around 100 years ago. Along the way it has morphed a number of times during the journey to adjust to the changing times. If we just look back at the eras the firm has lived through starting from the great depression, the world war, Indias freedom struggle, independence, writing of the Constitution, formation of the Supreme Court, Nehrus economic policy, so many different prime ministers, so many changes in capital markets and corporate law, the firm has so much experience behind it. If you have stayed around for so long and stayed relevant there is something right you are doing and it is all due to our core values.You need to be nimble and open to change; for instance, none of the people are the same, none of the clients are the same. We have always changed any adversity into opportunity. So in a sense for us it has been series of new beginnings. Accepting changes is the DNA of Amarchand. Anyone who is not nimble enough to accept changes wont survive and that is true for every business, not just law firms.The legal sphere has changed in every era, particularly in the past 20-25 years. This is an era where the idea of a modern law firm really took birth. And it was the Amarchand legacy which invented modern firmsmodern structure, campus recruitment, smart offices. Where do you think the next wave of changes will come for Indian law firms?Technology will be a big part of the change. Even today we are about 625 lawyers. Such a workforce requires a lot of management in terms of your resources, technology deployment and outreach to clients. The next big challenge would be how to make best use of technology and how to motivate human resources.In terms of the digital age and technology firms,  enforcement of contracts and (intellectual property) rights is a virgin area. A lot of conversation is on privacy and rights. Part of our business plan is to look at the most relevant new industries and almost all of them are based in technology. This is a new practice area and may become huge in coming years. For instance, the issue is around taxation, competition law, human rightsthese are the issues for these new-age businesses. It is fascinating. We are on the verge of a fourth industrial revolution and the old-world offerings and laws are a mismatch with new challenges and opportunities presenting themselves in this digital system.Our clients are changing all the time due to the churn in the corporate sector and so are the practice areas. For instance, the new bankruptcy codewe are tailoring our practice accordingly. What is needed is a pragmatic interpretation of the business scenario and adaptation to achieve policy goals. Overhauling of old regulations is too disruptive.Like Indian companies, Indian law firms are largely family operated. Do you see some changes happening there?This is a historical fact; better to say that there are founders who are still in control of firms. But, equally they have come a long way in sharing power. Its the pace of change that is a little uncertain. It would be incorrect to say that they are only founder-owned. Firms have a strong founder influence but they also have a lot of professionals who have a say in running the firm, including ours.What are your views on entry of foreign firms? Will it lead to consolidation?I think entry of foreign firms should be allowed as soon as possible so long it is done properly by keeping all stakeholders on board. This has been a lingering idea for so long and keeping this in a limbo for so long is not a good idea. At some stage it has to happen. It will enable the market to move to the next level in terms of sophistication, economics because currently fee levels are in a free fall; there is hyper competition, fees are going down, costs are going up, particularly for talent. There is need for a trigger to resolve the current situation and I think entry of foreign firms is going to be that trigger. Indian firms merging with foreign firms may not happen. India has not seen too many law firm mergers. There may be team acquisitions but big firm mergers may not happen.Recent corporate battles such as the Tata-Mistry spat have raised concerns about family control, corporate governance. What are your larger views on these issues?I do not comment on specific cases. But more generally, if we look at the corporate governance scenario and debate in India, we are dealing with a version 2.0. There is far more awareness about conflicts, what are the roles of different stakeholdersminority shareholders, independent directors, responsibility of promoters, institutional investors, proxy advisers. Everyone is taking their roles much more seriously and we have moved by leaps and bounds. Our firm has a separate division that is a corporate governance advisory, which is advising companies on governance issues. Most of the companies are facing issues such as managing conflicts such as related party transactions, succession, role of founders and promoters. India is the only country which has a concept of promoters. What is a promoteris it just a label, liability, does it give you extra power, all of this is being discovered on a case-by-case basis.There is this whole issue of promoters getting extra information that other investors dont. How does one resolve this?Promoters carry a lot of burden. Because they carry extra burden and are in control of the company, I see a rationale in them getting privileged information. What is ambiguous is that what is the boundary surrounding thatso that is evolving. The foundation of higher governance standards was laid with the Companies Act, 2013, and then Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India) amending the listing and disclosure requirements. But nothing happens with just regulations now, the laws are being tested with real-life examples.There is no regulator for law firms, does the Bar Council need changes? India has always operated under the idea that practising law is a privilege and this is a noble profession. So there are, for instance, restrictions on advertising. Unfortunately, globally practising law has become a business. Overseas regulations have evolved in terms of how you regulate a service and a businessprovider of the service and consumer of the service. We are still dealing with the first concept and that is the reason for the disconnect. There is a lack of understanding on business model; the law profession, it has now morphed itself into a business and a service. We still believe it to be a noble profession but we are also a business, we have a profit and loss account, we have to pay salaries. That is why the regulations have not kept pace with changing dynamics.But the flip side is that laws keep on changing and even flip-flopping.No matter how clearly the law is drafted, it will always need to be amended to suit newer dynamics. Its hard to cope with changes but actually we are happy that law is not static and it is evolving. Sebi does a good job of it and considers all the views, and that is the reason why the regulations come out looking much better.What is your view on Indian tax policies? We have acquired a bad name due to flip-flops on the issue. I wont deny the fact that India has a bad reputation in terms of stability in tax regime for a variety of reasons. But if you look at the direction and the political intent being displayed by the government, it is towards political stability. It is intended to create ease of business. If you compare it with the period two-three years back, it has got a lot better. What I worry about the current economic thinking is that it has started moving or slanting towards the left. What started off as a more right-oriented policy has now shifted to the left. One of the things that I see happening is inheritance tax. This may happen in the current regime. It comes from the mindset that 1% of the population is controlling 60% of Indias wealth. The broader theme is to move to a more stable tax regime. There are some aberrations such as the recent circular on FPIs (foreign portfolio investors). But the broader picture is to create a stable environment. I believe the government on that.What are your observations on the merger and acquisition (M&A) climate in India?I think the merger and acquisition climate is decent just now but a lot of underpinning of the market on the sell side is stressed asset pressure and for buy side or foreign investors, India continues to be a bright spot and an opportunity. Barring a few, most deals are local. In terms of deal execution, Indian acquirers are more flexible and can take much more risks than global acquirers. Global players take time in due diligence and paper work. And due to so much pressure of stressed assets, the sellers do not have patience to wait for global buyers or investors.Deals being closed in the stressed asset area are quite small, right?My take on this is that in the next couple of years, these stressed asset deals would be concluded bilaterally and not under bankruptcy code. Lets take the Jaypee, UltraTech, Rosneft deal, for example. The motivation was to sell stressed assets but it was completely done bilaterally and in a complete conventional M&A fashion. If it had to take place under, say, a bankruptcy code or a CDR (corporate debt restructuring) case, then it would not have ever happened. So from the sell side it is going to be a resolution of stressed asset situation and implementation would be bilateral. I think this trend is going to continue, till such time the new bankruptcy code and things surrounding it are completely settled. Assets that have lost all value would go down effectively as a garage sale through the bankruptcy code and assets with some good equity would continue to be sold bilaterally.",2017-01-27,cMTnz9x0Vfe9UIjOlFGGUK,"The managing partner of Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas on the next big challenge for law firms, the emergence of issues such as enforcement of contracts in a digital age and privacy rights",23:54,Accepting changes is the DNA of Amarchand: Cyril Shroff
17,0.249075,"San Francisco: Alphabet Inc. reported better-than-expected revenue thanks to a fast-growing cloud-computing business and booming YouTube video advertising, but the taxman spoiled the party. 
				   
				Fourth-quarter revenue, after payments for online traffic from distribution partners, was $21.2 billion, up 23% from a year earlier, the company said in a statement on Thursday. Profit before certain items was $9.36 a share. Analysts on average expected sales of $20.6 billion and profit per-share of $9.63, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The earnings miss was mostly caused by a one-time tax payment that pushed the tax rate to 22% from a 5% rate a year earlier. Chief financial officer Ruth Porat called it a discrete item, but didnt elaborate on a conference call.Excluding that, Google would have reported $10.13 a share in the latest period, according to Ken Sena, an analyst at Evercore ISI. Alphabet shares still fell in extended trading, which Sena attributed to high expectations and gross profit margins that slipped to 76% from 78%. The stock touched a record $861 on Thursday before closing at $856.98.It was a good quarter revenue wise, but margins were a little light because some of the strongest revenue growth came from licensing and other business that are less profitable, Sena said. Alphabets Google unit has been investing heavily in its cloud offerings, trying to catch market leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. All three are investing heavily in what is a booming business. On Thursday, Microsoft said cloud revenue almost doubled in its latest quarter.Alphabets capital expenditure reached $3.1 billion during a quarter, a 46% increase from a year earlier. Executives said some of this went toward facilities and infrastructure, including computer servers and data centers to support the companys online advertising business and cloud services. This spending paid off. Googles Other revenue line, which includes cloud computing, jumped 62% to $3.4 billion. This segment also includes sales from its app store and hardware devices.On the conference call, Alphabet said more investment in cloud is coming this year. Porat said most of the 2,100 additional employees hired in the fourth quarter joined the cloud business.Everywhere I look at, we are establishing a world-class enterprise team, Google chief executive officer Sundar Pichai said on the call. I definitely think were going to have a great year.The executives also highlighted YouTube, with Pichai saying revenue from the online video service continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by skippable TrueView ads, which marketers only pay for if viewers keep watching.While spending rose during the quarter, Alphabet was more frugal with its more experimental Other Bets, like self-driving cars and health care. These businesses generated $262 million in fourth-quarter revenue, up from $150 million a year earlier.

				Hyperloop, a low-pressure tube in which magnetically levitated pod-like vehicles can ferry passengers, sometimes at speeds in excess of 1,000 kmph, is the brainchild of Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX and Tesla Motors. But Musk, busy with his other ventures, is not developing a commercial Hyperloop. Two firmsHyperloop One and Hyperloop Transportation Technologies Inc. (HTT)are, and both are keen to introduce the Hyperloop in India. Hyperloop One is currently building a prototype in the Nevada desert in the US. Simultaneously, it is scouting for partners to whom it can license its technology to build Hyperloop routes in various countries. To that end, it launched a global competitionthe Hyperloop One Global Challengein which several consortia participated. Of these, 30 were shortlisted, including five from India, (prn.to/2jwi9UP), according to Nick Earle, senior vice-president of global field operations, Hyperloop One.By March this year, said Earle, who is on his first visit to India, we will demonstrate a pod travelling in passive magnetic levitation in a forward motion inside a pressure-reduced tube (not 100% vacuum). We are just weeks away from proving the technology with the worlds first demonstration.Unlike what his competitors are doing, insists Earle, the build-out at Nevada is a full-scale prototype with everything that you need to build a real-world Hyperloop. He said his companys philosophy is to build it, engineer it, prove that it works and then go to different countries to deploy it.Earle and his team are in India to meet government officials and potential partners and review the work of the five Indian teams. When we look at which country could benefit the most from Hyperloop, we look for large ridership population or freight demand, GDP growth, requirement for national productivity,  and the engineering and academic prowess to build this locally, said Earle who likens the Hyperloop concept to broadband for transportation.India, then, is a natural fit. Alan James, vice-president of worldwide business development for passenger systems at Hyperloop One added, India is the primary spot in Asia as far as Hyperloop is concerned.Hyperloop Ones rival HTT was founded on a crowd-funding model. In December, Bibop Gresta, chairman and co-founder of HTT, met Indias union minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari (bit.ly/2glawkG), and proposed linking  Mumbai and Pune with its ultra-high speed transport system. The cost (of building the track) depends on the location. To be generic, it will be $40 million per km. But it is one-fourth of high-speed rail. When you consider investment in infrastructure, you also consider how fast you can recoup it. This investment can be recouped in eight years, Gresta said. HTT has an exclusive agreement with the US-based Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for using its passive magnetic levitation system as the core of low-cost, safety-conscious construction and design in its Hyperloop, according to the companys website.Maglev, or magnetic levitation, is a technology that enables a train to float 1-6 inches above the track on a cushion of magnetic power and runs at a minimum speed of 350 kmph and a maximum of 500 kmph.Earle too says the Hyperloop will cost less than high-speed trains50% or less compared to the cost of high-speed rail or similar transport systems over a 30-year operational cycle, but we expect economic benefits to be three-and-a-half to four times greater.Apart from HTT and Hyperloop One, Spains Talgo SA, Germanys Siemens AG and Knorr Bremse AG, are wooing Indian policymakers with their transport technologies. Mint reported on 5 January (bit.ly/2joNU4s) that the ministry of road transport and highways has sought approval from the Niti Aayog to experiment and introduce new mass rapid transportation technologies such as Hyperloop and pod-taxis. Some pilots are already in the works. For instance, a pod-taxi pilot, with Metrino-PRT,  will soon let passengers use Indias first driverless pods on a 12.3km stretch from the Delhi-Haryana border to Badshapur via Rajiv Chowk in Delhi and Iffco Chowk and Sohna Road in Gurgaon. The project will cost Rs800 crore. Indeed, across the country governments and government departments are setting aside money for such projects. The Indian Railways, which seems sincere about high-speed trains this time and which has been running some trials with them,  is planning a capital expenditure of around Rs1.3 trillion for the fiscal year 2017-18the highest-ever capital outlay and is expecting a gross budgetary support of around Rs55,000 crore from the finance ministry.To be sure, its early days yet for Hyperloop. The technology solution is some time away, and the cost of developing it will run into  billions of dollars. Both Hyperloop One and HTT are rushing to raise funds from investors.On 1 December, HTT said it surpassed $100 million in total investment. This included an equity investment of $31.8 million and in kind and land value investments of $77 million. Earle of Hyperloop One, on the other hand, insisted that all the $160 million his company has been able to raise so far is in real, hard cash.Meanwhile, critics of Hyperloop claim that at such high speeds, there could be health hazards arising from travelling in Hyperloop (which can be built on the ground, in tunnels or higher up on pylons). Dismissing these concerns, Earle believes that the travel experience will be similar to what people have in air travelonly, there would not be any turbulence because things here are happening in a controlled environmentAccording to Earle, an airplane starts stationary, then it accelerates at about 0.3-0.4gwhich is what the Hyperloop pod accelerates atit then goes up in the sky, whereas the pod stays close to the ground. The reason the plane goes up in the sky is that it needs low air pressure to travel at 600 miles an hour; we take the low air pressure and bring it down to the ground. In its final leg, the plane decelerates and stops; thats exactly how the Hyperloop works: stationary, accelerating at 0.3g, travelling at 700 miles an hour, decelerating and then stopping. The human body doesnt sense speed; it senses acceleration, which is the same as in air travel.Does Hyperloop make sense for a country like India?G. Raghuram, professor, Public Systems Group, at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, says the concept of Hyperloop is a good one, as it can reduce energy consumption significantly and speed up transport.  However, he cautions that from a safety point of view, the technology is yet to be proven. Also, Im not sure how useful it will be for a country like India that needs to transport people on a large scale.  In my opinion, India should not jump headlong into it but take a wait-and-watch approach and see the implementation elsewhere first.Still, the prospect of travelling from Mumbai to Pune in around 30 minutes or Delhi to Mumbai in under two hours, without flying, is attractive.",2017-01-27,4SR0XqWS2qbkhtr5rrPC5I,"Hyperloop One and Hyperloop Transportation Technologies Inc. are, and both are keen to introduce the Hyperloop in India",00:56,Can Hyperloop transform how Indians travel?
327,0.2492,"On 15 January, at least 42,000 runners lined up at the starting point of the Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon, the largest road-run event in Asia. Jaspal Bindra, who came up with the idea in 2004, was nowhere to be seen. In 2016 too, he was not around. 
				   
				Bindra, the banks chief executive officer (CEO) for Asia and group executive director till early 2015, had not missed a single Mumbai Marathon till 2016. He had been living in Hong Kong from 2008 but would fly down for the eventalways held on the third Sunday in Januaryand cheer the runners. A few days ahead of the Mumbai Marathon, Bindra, 56, is a few minutes late for our luncheon meeting  at the NRI (Not Really Indian) restaurant at the Bandra-Kurla Complex in Mumbai. To avoid the hassle of choosing individual dishes, we opt for Jugal Bandi, a meal for two, accompanied by a glass of Chandon Brut each. The starters are South African peri peri wings, BBQ prawns and a Burmese green tea salad; this year-old restaurant serves Indian-inflected cuisine from around the world. As always, Bindra is dressed immaculately, in a white shirt and sky-blue turban. Some 15 years ago, over dinner at a different restaurant in south Mumbaihe was then regional general manager, India, and CEO of Standard Chartered BankBindra, digging into his chicken satay and prawn tempura, had commented, As long as I have an active sex life, I dont need to play golf. Those were not Twitter days, so it did not get wide publicity, but the banking community took note. He was perceived to be aggressive, someone who calls a spade a spade.During his two-year tenure as head of corporate and institutional banking at StanChart (1998-2000) and later as the head of both StanChart and ANZ Grindlays (he oversaw the merger of the two), Bindra showed 3,200 employees the doornearly 50% of the employee strength then.By a twist of fate, he himself had to quit the bank where he was one of the top five executives. Did he feel insecure after the StanChart board, under pressure from shareholders, asked CEO Peter Sands to leave? Bindras answer is quite logical. He was one of the top four executives of the bank reporting to Sands. The others were Mike Rees (overseeing the wholesale and retail assets), Andy Halford (group chief financial officer) and V. Shankar (another banker of Indian origin, in charge of Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Americas). Had the new CEO come from within the bank, I would have got a different responsibility. But since Sands successor came from outside, all four of us would have continued to do the same job. At mid-50s, I was looking for a different responsibility, he says. Was he eyeing the top job? Well, maybe not at that point of time but yes, if I had stuck around, I would have liked the challenge, Bindra says, nibbling on the spicy wings.He was the first to leave after Sands. By end-February 2015, he had put in his papers. Shankar and Rees followed him. Did he get a ton of money as a severance package? The standard practice in the bank is one years remuneration when a board-level executive quits. And he was not allowed to take up any job in the financial sector for a year after resigning.I cannot resist the temptation of asking how StanChart got into a situation in India where its bad assets ballooned and profits plunged. India, which accounts for anything from 15-20% of the banks global profits, and is probably the second-most important market along with Singapore, after Hong Kong, has gone through a real bad patch in the past few years. Was the local management (which was reporting to Bindra) reckless? Was it greed for balance-sheet growth that got the bank into trouble?Bindra says the bank actually weathered the collapse of Lehman Brothers well and continued to show growth in profit until 2012. Thereafter, it suffered on account of a severe structural shrinkage in commodity prices. What he means is that the companies to which the bank had exposure were in the commodity space and once they suffered, their ability to service bank loans was dented.Why did StanChart take such large exposures to so many companies in India which have in any case been over-leveraged, laden with loans they couldnt repay? Bindra says this assumption is not entirely correct. Our internal norms do not allow the bank to take more than 50% exposure in any loan. This means that even if it gives, say, a $1 billion loan to a particular company, it sells down 50-75% of it to other lenders within 90 days of disbursing the loan. So, we were as affected as others. It is not fair to say only StanChart accumulated bad assets.As the main course arrivesSri Lankan Potli Murg and dal makhani with tandoori roti and riceI decide to shift my focus to the present. Like quite a few other global Indian bankers, he is back in the country to do something on his own. Is it the proverbial return of the prodigal son? Also, what made him pick up a stake in Centrum Capital Ltd, a non-banking finance company (NBFC), and become an entrepreneur?I was 55 when I was leaving StanChart. I had three choices before meI could have got a similar job overseas and probably run a smaller bank as CEO; partially retire and join a few boards of companies and offer advisory services; or become an entrepreneur. And if I were to be an entrepreneur, it had to be in India, he says. Where else can you grow business in the banking and finance space? The public sector banks are losing their market share, foreign banks are shrinking business by design.... This is the best time to be in India. I could not afford to miss this window, Bindra says.Last April, he reportedly picked up close to a 20% stake in Centrum, started in 1995 by Bindras long-time friend Chandir Gidwani and Khushrooh Byramjee at the Bombay Mutual Building in Fort. It is a financial services firm with a presence in corporate finance, foreign exchange, wealth management, institutional broking and investment banking. It manages around Rs10,000- crore assets in its wealth management portfolio but does not have a balance sheet as such, for it does not give loans. Bindra is adding that piece to Centrum. He has started giving loans ranging from Rs5-20 crore to small and medium-size entrepreneurs. Not too many banks dabble in this segment where financing is based primarily on cash flows, not balance sheets. He has already built a portfolio of Rs400 crore in this business. Another new business is small and affordable housing finance in the range of Rs10-25 lakh. Again, there is a huge opportunity with the governments big push for affordable housing and drop in the cost of money. The third new fund-based business is private equity. We need to compete with some of the private banks and a few other NBFCs, not the entire banking system, Bindra says.When he picked up the stake in Centrum, the market value of the NBFC was Rs450 crore. Now it has crossed Rs1,500 crore. I assume that at Rs450 crore market value, for a 20% stake, he would have put in Rs90 crore. But Bindra says that may not be the correct figure as he has picked up a stake in the holding company, not the listed entity. Now all three partnersGidwani, Byramjee and Bindrahold equal stakes of around 20% each in the listed entity.After graduating from XLRI, a management school in Jamshedpur, Bindra joined Bank of America, where he spent 10 years. He spent another five at the Union Bank of Switzerland as head of business development in India before shifting to StanChart in August 1998, where he remained for 17 years. Brought up in Kolkata and many district towns in West Bengal (his father was a police officer), Bindras Bengal connection is still alive. His wife is from Asansol, and he visits his in-laws often. He can speak fluent Bengali but has not developed a sweet tooth. So, while I choose butterscotch ice cream for dessert, he orders coffee.The last round of conversation predictably revolves around demonetization. He joins the discussion a bit diplomatically. He agrees that digital banking in the unorganized sector is not easy but says that once we go cashless, the cost of operations will definitely come down and size will become less relevant for NBFCs. Currently, Centrum employs 2,000 people; for the foreign exchange business, its biggest earner, it has a presence at 19 airports and 100 outlets spread over 45 cities. Money is not a problem. There are plenty of funds available both as debt and equity. My challenge is to grow and build a solid track record and be in the reckoning to set up a bank. If available, we can buy a bank too, he says. All these, if at all, will happen after 2020. Till then, he wants to build a solid NBFC which can compete with private banks effectively.Like the Mumbai Marathon, StanCharts Indian Depository Receipts, or IDR, was also Bindras baby. He agrees with me that it was a flop. There have been issues such as tax and the class of investors who could buy IDRs. The insurance firms were never allowed to buy.... It was an experiment that failed, he says. StanChart remains the first and only foreign company to launch an IDR. But all that is behind him. I remind him of his life-size bronze statue on the eighth floor of Standard Chartered Bank Plcs old headquarters at Londons 1, Aldermanbury Squarea unique initiative of the bank to showcase the diversity of its employee base. In June 2013, the headquarters were shifted to 1, Basinghall Avenue in London. Does the new office still have his statue? He shrugs his shoulders. Bindra doesnt really care much for such things now.That day, the Centrum stock hit its lifetime high of Rs34.50. In 2016, when Bindra took over as the executive chairman and a promoter, it was trading at around Rs10.His favourite memory: Carrying the Olympic-flame torch for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.One assignment he loved: Global head of diversity and inclusion at StanChart, 2005-13.His hobby: Watching films, travelling with his wife.Favourite place on earth: Asansol, where his in-laws live (to keep his marriage alive!).One thing he would like to forget: the StanChart IDR; it was ahead of its time.One achievement he is proud of: the Mumbai Marathon.One bit of media coverage that he cherishes: Being featured in  Time magazine in 2010.",2017-01-27,ivDxiaKv9AlNq4jlbx7hyN,"Standard Chartereds man for India till early 2015, Bindra is back  now as an entrepreneur",15:32,Jaspal Bindra: Return of the prodigal son
172,0.249,"Mumbai: When the Indian government invalidated high-value banknotes on the night of 8 November, taking out 86% of the currency in circulation by value, it was supposed to be a war on unaccounted-for and untaxed wealth, counterfeit notes and terror financing.
				   
				Somewhere along the way, as serpentine queues formed outside bank branches and automated teller machines (ATMs) for days and weeks together, the slogan changed. It became all about promoting a cashless or at least a less-cash culture in an economy where almost 90% of transactions are paid for in cash.The talk turned to technologies such as mobile wallets, crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin, mobile peer-to-peer payments, block chain technology, payment banks and architectures such as the unified payment interface (UPI) and the recently-launched Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) app.The total value of all transactions done using electronic payment systems in India in December rose to Rs105 trillion from Rs95 trillion in November, according to representative data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on 17 January. They included transactions done through the real time gross settlement (RTGS) system, the national electronic funds transfer (NEFT) system, immediate payment service (IMPS), credit cards, debit cards, UPI, point of sale (PoS) terminals and mobile banking.Indeed, the growing popularity and rapid adoption of digital payment systems, in the face of a shortage of cash and stringent limits on bank withdrawals, may be a silver lining to the demonetisation of Rs500 and Rs1,000 notesan exercise that some critics have slammed as ill-conceived and hastily implemented.To be sure, India has a long way go before it joins the ranks of countries such as Sweden, Finland, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, Singapore, France and the UK where more than 85% of the consumer payment transactions are done digitally.But its a start. Consider this. A day after demonetisation, Ola Money, the digital payment solution offered by ride-hailing company Ola, reported an over 1,500% increase in recharges across the 102 cities of its operation. Oxigen Services India Pvt. Ltd, too, claimed to have broken all its previous records in money uploads and transaction count in the week after the demonetisation.Similarly, the National Payments Corporation of Indiathe umbrella organization for all retail payments systems in Indiaclaimed that in just two days (8-9 November), the use of its domestic card schemeRuPayalmost doubled to around 800,000 transactions a day, compared with a daily average of 400,000 transactions earlier (http://bit.ly/2gdu0bW).One97 Communications Ltd-owned digital payments firm Paytm said on 21 November it had seen more than seven million transactions worth Rs120 crore on that day alone. The company claimed that offline, person-to-merchant transactions had grown to contribute over 65% of transactions. Mobile wallet FreeCharge, too, said it had ramped up its acquisition effort and was targeting signing up one million merchants in the coming 12 months.On 16 January, Paytm said it has received a phenomenal response for new service categories such as hospitals, tolls and petrol pumps, and expects to add more categories in the coming months. According to the company, the new categories are generating six million transactions a month and are expected to overtake mobile recharges (in terms of order volumes) by mid-2017. Over the next few months, Paytm will expand to newer categories such as automobile service stations, school and college hostel cafeterias, dairy outlets, apartment maintenance and traffic challans. The company will convert into a payments banks over the next two months, according to a 4 January Press Trust of India report.In a bid to give the country a digital boost, NPCI said its new electronic toll collection (ETC) system would eventually include other vehicle-related payments such as parking fees, servicing and fuel charges (http://bit.ly/2fIv7xf).It was only in September that NPCI launched a pilot project for Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS) with 26 Bharat Bill Payment Operating Units (BBPOUs). Most banks now offer UPI-enabled apps on Google Play Store. To use a UPI-enabled app, you need an Android smartphone, a bank account and a registered mobile number linked to your bank account (http://bit.ly/2eiNqw1).Digital transactions began booming after e-commerce firms such as Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon, Myntra and Jabong began offering attractive discounts to woo customers. Banks accelerated the efforts with their own mobile wallets, mobile banking apps, and pitches of banking on smartwatches and even social networking sites (http://bit.ly/1fucY4s).The launch of Pockets by ICICI Bank Ltd, Lime by Axis Bank Ltd, PayZapp by HDFC Bank Ltd, SBI Buddy by State Bank of India and Ziggit by IDFC Bank Ltd are cases in point.Large telecom services providers such as Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone India Pvt. Ltd, too, have mobile payments solutionsAirtel Money and Vodafone M-Pesa, respectivelytargeted at their own customer base, largely for mobile recharges and remittances. Idea Money from Idea Cellular Ltd, and Jio-Money by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd are other telco-led payment solutions. Airtel, meanwhile, has also announced the launch of its payments bank.Banking in India is witnessing what Nandan Nilekani calls the WhatsApp moment, threatening to disrupt the banking ecosystem in India as payments move to mobile and lending to algorithms. With the launch of UPI, the country has crossed a significant milestone.Apart from making payments easier, UPI enables micro-credit. This will help the currently underserved small traders and businesses. The visibility into transactions provided by UPI apps enables financial institutions to evaluate the credit worthiness of its users. Instead of assets, credit will be based on transaction flow, and can be issued instantaneously. This will provide more choice for borrowers, especially those who depend on moneylenders and the informal sector for loans, says Venkatesh Hariharan, director of Indian Software Products Industry Round Table (iSPIRT)a think tank.Smartphones and increasing Internet penetration will only help Indias digital cause. Around 90% of all devices will be Internet-enabled by 2017, and the number of Internet users will touch 650 million by 2020 from 300 million in 2015, predicts a 25 July report by Google and Boston Consulting Group (BCG). The report forecasts the size of the digital payments industry in India to touch $500 billion by 2020, contributing 15% to Indias gross domestic product (GDP). It also predicts that the non-cash (including cheques, demand drafts, net-banking, credit/debit cards, mobile wallets and UPI) contribution in the consumer payments segment will double to 40% in the same period.Further, while around 30 billion bills worth $103 billion are generated every year, of which 70% are paid in cash, initiatives such as NPCIs BBPS may give a further impetus to the digitization of bill payments.The number of mobile wallet users is already three times the number of credit cards issued in the country (24 million in 2015-16), according to the Google-BCG report.The smartphone explosion in India is expected to usher in this new era in digital payments over the next few years, according to the Google-BCG report.India currently ranks second in the world with more than one billion mobile subscriptions. Of this, around 240 million consumers use smartphones, and this base is projected to increase to over 520 million by 2020.Smartphone subscriptions in the country will increase fourfold to 810 million by 2021, according to the India edition of the Ericsson Mobility Report released on 7 June.The Google-BCG report also highlights that micro-transactions will form a substantial portion of the industry, with more than 50% of the person-to-merchant transactions expected to be under Rs100. It predicts that the value of remittances and money transfer that will pass through alternative digital payment instruments will double to 30% by 2020. A related BCG study (http://bit.ly/2bc0gLk) in August forecasts that by 2020, about 315 million Indians living in rural areas will be connected to the Internet, compared with 120 million now.Globally, too, the payments landscape is seeing heightened activity across multiple categories, ranging from device manufacturers (Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co.), tech firms (Google, eBay Inc., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd), retailers (Starbucks Corp., Wal-Mart Stores Inc.), telecom companies (Vodafone Group Plc., Orange SA) and start-ups (Square Inc., TransferWise Ltd), according to the Google-BCG report.More disruption is expected as the number of fintech start-ups doubled to 1,000 in approximately five years, with funding growing six times to reach $11 billion in 2015.This hockey-stick growth is due to the axis shifting to the customer, who is today served by a variety of competing business models and methods driving its adoption. The explosion in mobile banking is proof enough of how private banks and, later, PSU (public sector undertaking) banks, too, got their act together and worked with start-up fintech firms to rejig their apps, sites and in-house wallets to keep up with customer expectations, rather than trying and do everything by themselves, or waiting for the regulator to issue diktats, says Probir Roy, co-founder and director of digital payments firm Paymate.Hiccups clearly exist.Indians love their cash. Paper currency facilitates making transactions anonymous, helping conceal activities from the government in a way that might help agents avoid laws, regulations and taxes. This is a big difference from most forms of electronic money that, in principle, can be traced by the government, wrote Kenneth Rogoff, Thomas D. Cabot professor of public policy and professor of economics at Harvard University, in an 11 April 2014 paper.This trend is borne out by the fact that retail payments in India, for instance, are still dominated by cash, with a mere 6-7% of transactions conducted electronically. The rest are in cash or cheque.Uber is primarily a cashless service elsewhere in the world, but more than 50% of Uber trips in India are paid for in cash, according to a 10 November blog by Forrester Inc. analyst Ashutosh Sharma.Sharma points out that in India, merchants are forcing the choice of cash payments on customers because electronic payments eat into their marginsjust like everywhere else in the world.Barriers to a cashless world, concurs the World Economic Forum (WEF), include the fact that some merchants still dont want the infrastructure costs and fees associated with electronic payments; some customers still find cash more convenient; access is an issue for individuals without bank accounts; and fraudsters continue to find opportunities in electronic transactions.Consumers who have tried using digital payments but have now shifted to other modes such as cash, card and online banking say the inconvenience of remembering log-in credentials, insufficient acceptance, possibility of a technical or human mistake during a transaction and frequently running out of balance are the top reasons for lapsing, according to the report by Google and BCG. Hence, expanding merchant acceptance is critical to driving mass adoption by consumers.As of 30 September, the number of PoS devices which accept debit and credit cards as modes of payments at merchant outlets was a mere 1.49 million, according to the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBIs) monthly bulletin. Indians had nearly 730 million debit cards and 27 million credit cards at September end, though it isnt clear, however, how many people have more than one card (http://bit.ly/2gc6sFy). Moreover, most Indians use debit cards to withdraw cash from ATMs.According to Roy, a cashless economy has to have appeal and practicality at the most elementary level for consumers and merchants alike, especially given the plethora of overlapping and competing payment options.There are great apps for mobile banking, money transfer, shop and pay, tap and go, etc., and then there are the old faithful viz. net banking, prepaid cards, IMPS and e-wallets, USSD (unstructured supplementary service data) and UPI. The latter (USSD and UPI), yet to quite reach their WhatsApp moment, saddled as it is by the way banks have implemented, and promoting them vis-a-vis other offerings, lack of a people-friendly branding and a common user interface, explains Roy.Roy cites the example of a food court in a mall where you load your food court plastic card, redeem at food stalls on par and cash out the balance when done.Security is another big concern. According to cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab, while those who have been transacting online are fairly well-versed with the threats one can face while paying online, its the first-time users or new adaptors that need to be educated on the risks they are exposed to.According to Altaf Halde, managing director (South Asia), Kaspersky Lab, while payments through smartphones are very convenient and frees one of the pressures to hold cash, it calls for precautions. One small slip-up can cause one a huge loss. While companies are bound by law to follow guidelines, fraudsters find their way through many security barricades. The only way to safeguard oneself, in such a scenario, is to be vigilant while paying and to keep the mobile protected with a security plan. With these two simple steps, people can ward off almost all financial theft risks. As the current adjustment period makes way for settlement, we are sure that more people, across economic strata, will find digital payments way more convenient and may make it their preferred mode of payment, says Halde.Being an online security firm, Kasperky Lab recommends that users should get themselves a mobile security plan.Moreover, interoperability issues are causing friction between banks and mobile wallet service providers.On 16 January, for instance, Mint reported that ICICI Bank Ltd had blocked transactions on payments app PhonePe in at least the second such instance of a commercial bank trying to protect its turf against non-bank mobile wallet and payment companies.PhonePe is a UPI app.A day later, PhonePes co-founder and chief executive officer Sameer Nigam took to microblogging site Twitter to allege that ICICI was blocking transactions since Friday (http://bit.ly/2jlYhGX).ICICI Bank cited security concerns as its reason for blocking PhonePe. NPCI initially ordered ICICI Bank to rectify the situation.

This will allow banks to have a wider acceptability of popular third-party prepaid cards and wallets, with minimal loading failure rates.Second, it will enable them to, inter alia, inter-operate seamlessly and with minimal friction across a multi-sided base comprising e.wallets, banks and common merchants (same QR code for instance).Third, banks will have to rework service level agreements with their PoS merchants and card networks to ensure a much higher reliability.In conclusion, says Roy, India is too large a country, diverse in its perceptions, behaviours and idiosyncrasies to have a one-size-fits-all strategy for a post-cash world.",2017-01-27,ODcuu2wmWqGWNUY6wHhmmJ,The rapid adoption of digital payment systems is seen as a potential silver lining to the exercise that caused a widespread cash crunch thats only now beginning to ease,01:27,Indias cash conundrum: how ready is India to go cashless?

				Trumps order temporarily bars citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States even if they hold valid visas or permanent residence permits, a move that caught many companies off-guard.Netflix Inc chief executive Reed Hastings called it a sad week and added: It is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity.Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook sent a letter to employees saying Trumps order was not a policy we support and promised to help affected employees. We have reached out to the White House to explain the negative effect on our coworkers and our company, Cook added.

1,0.249825,"At Mints 10th Annual Banking Conclave on 23 January, Indias top bankers got together to discuss issues confronting the sector such as competition, growth and asset quality. SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya, ICICI managing director (MD) and chief executive officer (CEO) Chanda Kochhar, Punjab National Bank MD and CEO Usha Ananthasubramanian, HDFC Bank MD Aditya Puri, Axis Bank MD and CEO Shikha Sharma, and Citibank India CEO Pramit Jhaveri took part in the discussion on Indian Banking: The new landscape moderated by Tamal Bandyopadhyay. Edited excerpts: 
On increasing competition and the changing banking landscape, with the emergence of differentiated banks:Puri: Competition will come, there will be a change in the financial landscape...congruence of information, technology, mobility, analytics and computing (means) that there will be a change in the business model. All of us are pretty much prepared today to offer every conceivable financial service to the customer in any form he wants. He wants it manually, he wants it on the phone, computerhe can have a complete set of services which include what wallets would do, what payment banks would do. If he comes to our bank say on our mobile phone, he can buy mutual funds, buy insurance, he can download an app like a wallet... he can get his assets report. We are pretty much ahead of the curve. We are not complacent.On foreign banks in India: Jhaveri: If you look back in time in the last 25 years, this industry has been no stranger to competition, this industry has been no stranger to disruption. In the last two decades, we have seen this happen multiple times; this industry is not afraid of competition... Since the financial crisis, the global industry has undergone significant changesome of it is because of the crisis, the new regulatory regime. As far as we are concerned there are natural advantages which we bring to the tablethere is a global footprint, global reach... If you combine that with our strength in India from the technology point of view, disruption point of view, we are very pleased with what we were able to do both on the corporate and consumer side. If you look at the number of milestones which have taken place... things have only got better over time. On the limited growth of foreign banks in India:Jhaveri: At the end of the day, you have to look at the presence you can have in a particular market place around the constraints we operate. At the end of the day, we have a limited branch footprint. When you look at innovations, plenty of which we have had on the consumer side, institution side, I will not bore you with that. You look at the market share (of foreign banks) with a very small physical footprint in the countrythe credit card business, wealth management business; I will not bore you with numbers. Our market share is significant...On the emerging competitive scenario:Ananthasubramanian: If you see Indian banking, every public sector bank remained a regional bank. Post-liberalization, with branch expansion, competition started. It will continue to be on, irrespective of the players coming in... Given the competition, I will say if you lay a cake on this table and everybody takes a piece, the cake will continue to grow. That is the scope of banking. But Indian banks have realized that you have to be on your toes and take competition through the route of technology. The established banks in the country can take on competition and still remain in harmony.Sharma: We will see new forms of competition coming. We have also invested a lot in terms of technology through a range of products to our customers and making sure we are able to differentiate in terms of service. We are pretty well prepared and any functionality customer is looking for, we have a digital footprint around that. We will not be embarrassed. We are excited by some of the competition. In India, today there is still a huge market out there...Jayakumar: Most significant challenge which we face is to complete the transformation exercise. One is to strengthen our basic processes, second is to get digital, analytical, etc., third is significant of people. That is a significant objective at this point of time. That said, we have a bunch of young people who are pushing forward, my perspective of the whole thing is get ourselves fit, get these changes done.Kochhar: I dont think many of us will be able to say different things because already a lot has been spoken. The Indian banking industry has always faced competition because we have certain areas of business that we are following; sometimes it is interest rates and currently technology is disruptive again. New entrants are coming in the field. A lot of changes are happening across...the financial spectrum. A lot of what these small entities can do, banks can also do; banks have a larger relationship with the customers. Second is, competition expands the market, it brings more and more people to the formal lending market.Bhattacharya: We have been alive for the past 111 years... We have in fact used competition at every level to sort of lift up, and in the last 10 years actually in deposits we have gained 300 basis points market share, from 15.3% we are up to 18.3% and in advances we have gained 60 basis points. We have a customer base of 350 million and on a daily basis we were opening 50,000-70,000 accounts...after demonetisation, we alone opened 89 lakh accounts, thats  the kind of the reach we have. Demonetisation gave us a boost in ensuring our BC (business correspondent) channels were really active, we have a huge amount of collaboration. We have 235,00 PoS (point of sales) machines which are paying out cash; competition makes us tougher, wiser and better.On how easy or difficult is it to change public sector banks:Jayakumar: One is to look at a parallel transformational exercise SBI has done. I have spoken to their CEOs, past and present. As far as changes are concerned, there will be some resistance; once plans start showing results, resistance starts coming off... I think it has lot to do with the way we communicate, but accept that there will be some pushback and you have to pick the right battles. On impact of demonetisation on monetary transmission:Bhattacharya: In Indian banks, 97% of resources come from deposits. Therefore, if you are not cutting rates of deposit, you will not be able to pass on that benefit (of lower rates). You cut rates of deposits when they are plentiful in the system. It is a simple law of demand and supply. All the banks are saying that if RBI (Reserve Bank of India) cuts rates and keeps liquidity tight, there is no way transmission can occur. Till March this year, liquidity was very very tight. However, because of the huge deposits that have come into the system, we are able to reduce the cost of deposits and automatically that will flow into cost of borrowing. A lot of us are held back, we are not sure how much of those resources will stay with us. If these resources prove to be stable, which we will get to know in the next 2-3 months, you will see deposit rates further falling... you will see impact on borrower side. On deposits, we are quite conservative; on loan side not so. The reason is that is we want to give a fillip to credit growth, with so much of deposits hanging on our hands if I dont give a fillip to credit growth I will not be able to make the best of the situation. On deposits side we are still being conservative.Puri: At the moment we have a tremendous amount of supply. If money is tight and we are not dependent on our borrowers funds, then unless the supply of money exceeds demand, rates will not come down... Sharma: For a quarter I will expect rates to remain low depending on when restrictions on withdrawls are removed. We will go quarter by quarter.Ananthasubramanian: This is a kind of one-off event that has happened in the countrys history. This kind of accretion we have never seen. Bank deposits have surged... Maybe, I am guessing, 40% will stay with us...For a short while, it will be an advantage that will flow to the customers.Kochhar: We should recognize this was a one of its kind event. Even in the first six months of the year, total accretion to the banking system was Rs5.4 trillion but just in these two months, accretion was another Rs6 trillion. In that sense liquidity has come into the banking system and therefore reduces the lending rate. Some part of it will go back to the system, and some should go back to the system. Impact on interest rates is (that) we will definitely remain in a soft interest rate regime.Ananthasubramanian: In the post-demonetisation era, what has happened is, specially women I speak of, that money has moved from masala dabbas to the banking sector. People have opened accounts, money has moved into the system, that is one. It is very important to educate (customers) and plan strategy with them, which is happening. People are being educated about various services like SIPs (systematic investment plans)...Jhaveri: When you look at credit offtake and investment, we tend to focus just on the private sector. When you look at different offtakes, we talked about consumers, households. I think there is no problem with credit offtake. As far as private corporate sector is concerned, working capital needs to increase, there are certain clear indications that working capital cycle is increasing. Hopefully, that will be followed over time as some will start increasing capacity utilization. It has been a tough period in terms of credit offtake...Kochhar: When you look at credit growth, lets also look at two things in terms of how the Indian economy is structurally changing. One is supply of credit itself, if you look at the last one year, there was a Rs4 trillion increase in the banking credit; there is an equal amount of issuance of bonds and commercial paperwe tend to ignore that. Second is that structure of economy is also changing...Its not just about working capital increase of a particular company, how it is translating into a lot of start-ups that are then increasing multiplier impact on the economy...Sharma: On retail side, as everybody has said, growth has been reasonably heavy, and some products are more interest rate-sensitivefor instance mortgages, very interest rate-sensitive. The fact that interest rates have come off, helps the mortgage market; may be right now people are waiting (in the hope) that home prices will correct next quarter or so; home loans should see annual growth from here, auto loans and retail loans have done well... We expect working capital growth to pick up. As far as private investment is concerned, we need to wait for the consumption cycle to play out. Credit growth of double digits is a good number. Bhattacharya: Investments happen when your existing capacity starts getting utilized to around 80-85%. Now for that to happen, demand has to go up. At this point of time, two things will make demand go up. Because demand in this country exists, its a question of people actually executing on that demand. One is business confidence goes up and two ease of doing business goes up. Both of these two are very important. Government has in its hands one very potent trigger that can actually be used for doing both the things, that is the budget. In the budget, it has been our recommendationboosting both consumption and investment. Now if this is done in proper manner I do believe it can act as a very good trigger. This along with resolution of large stressed assets on which we are working on very, very assiduously. These two things can actually bring back the demand.On pain caused to the informal economy by demonetisation, impact on demand:Puri: I think in most of the organized sector and sectors that moved from the unorganized to the organized sector, it (demand) has pretty much returned. I talked to Bharat Puri at Pidilite, he is seeing a return to whatever was there on 8 November; I talked to Harsh Mariwala (Marico Ltd chairman), he is also surprised with the V recovery; then I see for ourselves, we are back to 8 November.Sharma: I think what Aditya said is that in the formal sector or which has moved to the formal sector, recovery has surprised all by being V-shaped but the segments which are cash segment parts of agriculture, there I think the recovery is slower.Puri: The second part is that the parts of the economy that are moving from informal to formal sector also will create demand for assets. What you were financing previously though cash will now have to be financed with the banks.On banks asset quality. Is the worst over?Bhattacharya: One must understand somethingthat non-performing assets (NPAs) are not a one-time occurrence. NPAs are an occurrence that happen throughout the life of any institution, not only for banks, even for businesses. Even businesses have to write off some amount of receivables. What happened in this case was that a large number of units, especially in infrastructure, went bad because investments happened in one short and small space of time and many of the investments could not result in the ultimate assets getting created and cash flows getting established. This happened on account of many, many things that happened in the economy in a particular space of time. Having said that, I must say that whatever the government has done for enabling better resolution is going to have its effect, it may not have yet started...Yes, the worst is over...These are evolving times. Impact of demonetisation on SMEs (small and medium enterprises), that will come with a lag of about a quarter. It takes time to trickle down into the banks book. By March 2017, we should look at things getting better.Kochhar: When we talk of NPAs we generally just get stuck with recognition and numbers. Important point is recognition, resolution and provision. Now, if you look at banks in India, recognition-wise there are RBI rules, not just that. RBI followed earlier recognition through the AQR (asset quality review), we have also been doing that. As far as provisions are concerned, some banks have been proactive to actually provide more to the extent possible. On recognition and provisioning, a lot of work has happened.What is very important is that...we give equal amount of focus on resolution...Jayakumar: I am not focused on gross NPA ratio and that number for us has been coming down. Second, there are risks in the mid-market segment. Three, one hopes some of the larger accounts get resolved; that will provide us with some upgrades that will pay for the litigation.

				Net profit rose to Rs1,701 crore in the quarter ended 31 December from Rs1,521 crore a year ago. The profit was higher than the median estimate of Rs1,674.8 crore in a Bloomberg poll of 15 analysts.Net interest income, the difference between interest earned on loans and paid on deposits, rose 17% to Rs2,769 crore from Rs2,363 crore a year earlier.HDFCs total loan book grew 16% year-on-year to Rs2.86 trillion on the back of growth in non-individual loans. This included loans for lease rental discounting, where the equated monthly instalment depends on rent paid by the tenant.ALSO READ | The great Indian home loan puzzleDuring the quarter, the firm also sold individual loans worth Rs3,355 crore to HDFC Bank. The average size of home loans remained unchanged at Rs25.7 lakh. The company provided Rs830 crore against tax during the October-December quarter, inclusive of a deferred tax liability worth Rs108 crore against a special reserve. It had provided Rs1,980 crore during the same period last year.Gross non-performing loans in the quarter amounted to Rs2,341 crore, marginally higher than in the second quarter.

The firm clarified that it has not taken the benefit of relaxation in bad loan norms for small-value loans permitted by the Reserve Bank of India and National Housing Bank following demonetization. The central bank had allowed lenders 90 days for classifying stressed standard accounts as non-performing assets if the payments were due between 1 November and 31 December.The housing finance firm remains positive about its outlook. By March, individual loan book growth should come back to normalcy. Non-individual has not been affected due to demonetization.

A 3 January report by Morgan Stanley warns of increased risk of higher prepayments and pressure on net interest margins following the sharp cut in lending rates.Banks are likely to be aggressive in pursuing loan takeovers, given weak system loan growth. Housing finance companies will likely be forced to either reprice old loans lower or risk higher prepayments from balance transfers. But new business growth is likely to be weak, and we expect pressure in the next few quarters from old loan repricing even as fixed-rate liabilities take time to reprice.

295,0.24915,"At a regulators round table at the Mint Annual Banking Conclave held in Mumbai on 23 January,  former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor D. Subbarao and former Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chairman C.B. Bhave talk about the impact of demonetisation, the move towards a cashless economy and the autonomy of RBI in a session moderated by Mints consulting editor Tamal Bandyopadhyay. Edited excerpts: 
After demonetisation, everybody is talking about growth slowing down. The latest one was the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which said 100 basis point growth will be compromised this year, another 150 basis points next year. India will lose the tag of the fastest-growing economy in the world. In fact, Moodys said India will continue to remain the fastest-growing economy. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) estimates say that demonetisation impact will be 50 basis points. Can you please tell me how short will be the short-term pain and how long will it take the long-term gain, and what kind of gain do you see? Subbarao: On the growth numbers itself, I must admit I have not crunched the numbers but I have seen fair estimates, from Dr Manmohan Singh in Parliament saying loss of GDP (gross domestic product) will be 2 percentage points, to RBI saying that it will be 5% but the consensus seems to be above 1 percentage point of GDP. What is quite clear though, on which there is lot of agreement, is even though we might lose some GDP in one year, recovery will be quite V shaped as we are already seeing that V-shaped recovery, there will be no hysteresis in the sense that once economy is remonetised we will get that trend, loss if any will be one-third loss. Of course, that will be a huge loss. Apart from the loss to GDP, hundreds of million less privileged in the country had endured pain and hardship, and also economic loss. Cost of demonetisation has been direct in the short term, the benefits are uncertain and unquantifiable. The question is: Will the net cost-benefit calculus be positive. The hope is that it will be positive provided two things happen. The way I look at two methods I use for assessing the success of demonetisation. The first is to what extent this process destroyed or detected (black money). Second, to what extent is regeneration of black money prevented by demonetisation as everyone has said tax black money, act on time, it does nothing to prevent allegations, it puts a fear like Chinese say they killed a chicken to scare the monkey. So if there is fear in people creating black money that they are going to get penalized, benefits will be quite substantial. So you are saying that demonetisation should not be the end of it, there should be a series of it?Subbarao: Absolutely. You know already in reports about people generating (black) money, all the people who come down the system and are detected to have black money. There should be a trail on them. There should be other mechanisms. GST (goods and services tax) itself might be a big instrument in spotting black money. There should be other audit trails, investigating agency, tax agency. They must use technology. Most of all, the government must create a fear in people that if they indulge in black money creation. If some people are caught in this operation, it would be great. How do you see the economy in the next few quarters? In a democracy, we actually need to create fear to implement thingsis this the right way to do something?Bhave: Firstly, I am not an economist. From what I read of estimates that have come out, nobody has a clue. People are still gauging what the impact will be. As third-quarter results of listed companies come out, we will get some indication. There is about one month and eight days of a quarter, which is normal. Sectors likely to be affected will be cash dependent. Initially, unlisted portion of the economy, informal sectors will be affected more. I neither believe in extreme forecast of 3%, also some people who are saying its marginal impact, I think we are going to land somewhere in between. If you say by 31 March that quarters results will reveal the impact, isnt that too early?Bhave: (With) March results, which will come out in April, you will know two things. One, the full impact of demonetisation disturbance on companies and the way the economy is recovering because we need to know both these things (to know) what kind of debate it is going to have. Lot of people are hoping that the recovery will be V-shaped and you will see the recovery coming up as fast as the downturn came in. I dont know.Do you have anything to say to what Dr Subbarao said about a series of measures as a follow-up and you need to create fear among people, black money hoarders. Is this the way forward? Do you agree with that?Bhave: I agree with Dr Subbarao completely that we need to address the flow problem as well. My take on the issue of corruption is that this is probably the most important issue which we tend to ignore. Secondly that in our conversation we discuss it as something outside of the room, not realizing all of us in the room are responsible directly or indirectly for generation of unaccounted money. This has infested our body politics, our social body to such an extent (where) we are in such a state (that) you have a patient with (his) body entirely infected... lets say, these are the two conditions. You should not operate on so small a part that as soon as you finish the operation, rest of the body gets infected again; you should not operate on such a large body part, that patient himself will be dead. As if these two conditions were not enough, the knife I am giving you has also poison on it, the machine through which you have to implement is also an issue and, therefore, we are only going to find a long-term answer to it. I agree with Dr Subbarao that we need to initiate the step, but dont expect quick results from it.If you remember Prime Ministers 8 November address to the nation, demonetisation was about fighting terror financing, fighting counterfeit notes, terrorism. There was no reference to a cashless economy. There was speculation how much money we will get.  Then we see the lottery is used to promote the drive to cashless.Subbarao: If the objective is only to move the economy to cashless, evidently I believe that the motivation of demonetisation was to assault black money. I was also surprised like Tamal that the government in last two-and-a-half months has talked about different objectives at different times and were somewhat muffled in their communication. I would have been quite happy if they said the intent of demonetisation is to attack black money and there are other incidental benefits of demonetisation such as the transition to a cashless economy to an extent which are consistent with our other objectives.In your book you spoke about how Denmark and Sweden are becoming cashless economies. As a former regulator, what is the right way to go towards a cashless economy? Subbarao: Well it is not that I have done extensive calculation on a cashless economy. I must take some pride that I talked about cashless economy before it became such a popular phrase or slogan in our country. I was talking about a cashless economy, of course the benefits of which come out of it including, creating an audit trail. I was talking more in the context of negative interest rate. You go back one year, January/February last year, the big thing around global economy was how negative interest rate is going to work . It will work if you go towards a cashless economy. It was in that context I was motivated to write about economy. I think it is still possible to go towards a cashless economy and pursue the objective of financial inclusion.From economics to logistics, you spoke about the economics part of it. I would like you to tell us about the logistics part. Being chairman of NSDL (National Securities Depository Ltd), you are somehow the architect of dematerialized shares in India. That was a humongous task at that point of time, physical shares transition to demat, scale was much smaller but there may be some similarities. Are there lessons to be learnt from your demat exercise in terms of sequence?Bhave: Its an interesting question. As you rightly said that we cant really compare the two. When we went in for the demat process, we had about 20 million customers. Today, even if you take the adult population as 500-550 million people, there is that difference. The other important difference is that, in the entire implementation of the demat process ... it was between the regulator and the actors in the demat process like stock exchanges and NSDL, etc. who arrived at most of the decisions. The impact it makes is that when you dont have the sovereign, you cant compel people to do something. You need to do things in the provision of the law. The Demat law said the investor had a choice in either physical or demat form. We had to stay clear of this. Sebi doesnt get as much credit for this work but under (D.R.) Mehtas chairmanship Sebi adopted an absolutely collegial approach to this. We never got the feeling that we were not heard. Third important point is that at such times, the incentive for an actual player is to push for more and more. But in practical terms, considering the size of the country reach it is wiser to go step by step. NSDL played that role, said no many times to higher dematerialization because we advised, we will learn from the mistakes. The last point we made sure small investors were not affected by it. Any shareholder can sell shares up to 500 in physical form. The Regulator always kept its window open. What you do is 80:20 rule, you are pushing 20% but covering 80% of the market. If I paraphrase you, the sovereign should not have much role in the entire exercise. We need to leave it to executives, you need to go through a consulting process, you need to sequence it properly and in certain segments give them enough time.Bhave: Only the first part. I didnt say that the sovereign should not be a part of it. But I said if the sovereign is part of it, you run across the temptation to compelwhere he is not part of the thing that table will be conscious in progressing.Everybody talks about RBI autonomy, what about Sebis autonomy? In 2010 you tested that. There was a fight between the insurance regulator and Sebi, and you lost it. Was that the reason you didnt get a second term. In my interview, you said chairmen come and chairmen go. How independent is this institution and what is your take on that?Bhave: Ultimately any regulatory institution is a creature of law. So it needs to work within parameters of this law. Every single regulatory law in the country has a provision which says the government can issue directive to this regulator to do something. I am just saying autonomy in a sense is circumscribed by this fact that there is an overlapping provision. In practical terms in my mind autonomy comes from how the leadership of the regulator is removable. The Constitution makers wanted the Election Commission, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India to be independent offices, the Supreme Court judges, they made provision that these people can be removed by two-thirds majority of Parliament before their tenure ends.Are you saying its not the institution but the leader that matters? At the end of the day, the buck stops at the leader. The same institution can have less or more autonomy. Whats the wrestling power of the leader?Bhave: The leader matters certainly, you build institutions with the people. You need people who have that assurance and who know they are not subject to arbitrary removal. They have financial autonomy. In practical terms, autonomy is also determined by what kind of personality people are dealing with issues. People who are sensitive to institutional importance would deal with the same issue in a different way. Subbarao: I cant just give a binary answer. I think the perception is much more than the reality. And that perception arises from the fact that there is a section of the law under which the government can issue any instruction to RBI that it considers in public interest, but after consultation with the governor. In the last 80 years of RBI history, Section 7 has been quiet inconsequential. That section has never been invoked. The government has never given any instruction invoking Section 7. The belief that RBI is not autonomous because some section is in law, is completely misread. Sometimes there is pressure on RBI to do things that it is not comfortable in doing. I believe RBI is and should be autonomous in close domains of RBI mandates. Monetary policy, regulation of financial institutions, payment systems on those issues categorically mandate RBI is autonomous and should not bend to the pressure. Over the last eight years from Sir Benegal Rama Rau to Dr Raghuram Rajan, RBI has maintained the tradition of enforcing autonomy.You have agreed that its this perception that RBI ends up compromising Subbarao: There is misinformed perception that RBI doesnt enjoy autonomy and that perception gets strengthened because of repetition. There is responsibility both on part of the government and RBI to manage and improve this perception. Doing what it believes is in the best public interest no matter what the government believes should be done.That is number one. First of all, I think body language used should be very mesh. Second, public criticism of Reserve Bank is powerful of course. RBI is a policy institution, it makes policy that affects the lives of millions of people. But there is one exception. The government should not criticize the RBI governor because that is detrimental to macroeconomic management. If the markets believe that there are differences between the government and RBI, that is not constructive but destructive. The government, if it has any concerns about RBI policy management, that should be internally managed.You said that in the history of RBI, 80 years now and Sebi, 25-plus years, section 7 was never used. I will ask now a counter question. Why do I need to use section 7? If I advise and you listen to me, in a short notice it is actually a threat.Subbarao: I think it is exaggerated. On what basis you say RBI autonomy has been touched upon in question of demonetisation. RBI board has taken half an hour, I dont know exactly. There is no experience. This was a decision that was taken on judgement. There were people on RBI board. I want to ask a counter question. How long does the Union cabinet take to approve the Union budget? 15 minutes. How long does a state cabinet take to approve state budget? 10 minutes. I can tell you because I was finance secretary of state and finance secretary to state governor.I believe that the RBI board must respect that they have taken a considered decision. The governor himself has said that they were in consultation with the government for the past several months. Its like the army preparing for battle and the decision to attack takes place in a very short period of time. That is exactly what has happened, I am not an insider anymore. I believe they have been preparing for long time.",2017-01-30,cEDJ5YKqm297EuY9w9ZsxM,"Former RBI governor D. Subbarao, former Sebi chairman C.B.

It would have about 390 million customers and about 40% market share by revenue before any antitrust concessions.To try to make the numbers work in an all-share deal, the proposal excludes Vodafones 42% share of an Indian towers company called Indus, worth about $4 billion. That brings the value of the Vodafone mobile business closer to Ideas market capitalization, which jumped more than 25% to $5.2 billion on Monday (from $4.1 billion).If a deal is finalized, Vodafone could then sell down its stake in the merged company over time, hopefully at a better price if its better able to withstand the heat from Jio.

It targets a rental yield of 7.5-8.25% per annum and a gross internal rate of return (IRR) of 12-16% at a fund level, including capital appreciation on exit.Reliance already has a strong pipeline of transactions and is expecting to do the first closing shortly, around the time it will also start deploying the capital, Madon said. The new fund will have the first-mover advantage, even though there is a pipeline of more office funds coming up later this year, analysts said.After the economic slowdown in 2008, developers gave up capital-intensive office projects and shifted focus to the residential market, which seemed a safe bet at the time. A number of large apartment projects came up in the next few years, resulting in a glut in the market and another slowdown in 2012-13.Madon said its a good time to invest in office properties, with valuations being reasonable and prices not having gone up.The commercial office sector is in the cusp of a recovery, he said.Though demand is in excess of supply of office space today, there is a good pipeline of projects with developers looking to build new office projects again. Not just the top few cities, but Hyderabad is back on the radar and even a market like Navi Mumbai attracts good demand for new office space, said Shashank Jain, partner, transaction services at PricewaterhouseCoopers India.If all goes well, 2017 will also mark two significant events in commercial real estate. DLF Ltds stake sale in its commercial property arm, DLF CyberCity Developers Ltd, to institutional investors, is expected to be concluded and Embassy Group and Blackstone Group Lp may go for a real estate investment trust (REIT) listing.Reliance AIF is currently also raising a Rs1,000-crore residential fund from Indian and overseas investors.

388,0.24815,"Last week, at the Mints 10th Annual Banking Conclave in Mumbai, one question was common for both former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor D. Subbarao and the current chiefs of large India banks: what do they expect from the union budget?
				   
				Subbarao wants the government to stick to the fiscal consolidation path but most bankers (not all) want Indias finance minister to focus on growth, even if that means a slightly expansionary budget. Chiefs of the three biggest state-owned banks also said they would like the budget to take note of the capital requirement of banks.Most analysts say that the government will be able to stick to the target of a fiscal deficit of 3.5% of gross domestic product, or GDP, in the current fiscal year that ends in March and aim for at least 3.3% fiscal deficit for 2018. The government has been diligently lowering the fiscal deficit for seven years since 2012 when the deficit touched 5.9% of GDP.Subbarao feels that even though there could be a slowdown in growth in the wake of the so-called demonetisation exercise, the government should adhere to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act which seeks to institutionalize financial discipline.ALSO READ | Banks eyeing big-ticket reforms in budget: SurveyThe original objective of the Act was to bring down the fiscal deficit to 3% of the GDP by March 2008 but in the aftermath of the global meltdown, the Act was first postponed and later suspended in 2009. A committee headed by former revenue and expenditure secretary N.K. Singh to reconsider reinstating the provisions of the Act submitted its report on 23 January, a week before the presentation of the budget.The report is not in the public domain but people familiar with its recommendations say the N.K. Singh Committeewhose members include RBI governor Urjit Patel and the chief economic adviser to the finance ministry Arvind Subramanianis in favour of fiscal consolidation but not sacrificing growth.While no one can question the importance of keeping the fiscal deficit low, the budget should also focus on reform in the banking industry. Many of the government-owned banks that have around 70% share of banking assets are laden with bad loans and need capital to stay afloat. Indeed, the banking system plays the most critical role in carrying out the governments development agenda but precious little is being done for the banks.ALSO READ | Budget 2017: Government should stick to fiscal targetsBut for them, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, the most ambitious financial inclusion programme ever undertaken in any part of the world, would not have been successful. Till 11 January, some 266.8 million new accounts have been opened and 210 million debit cards have been issued. One-fourth of such accounts still do not have any money in them but post-demonetization, the collective balance in such accounts has swelled to Rs69,000 crore. The banking industry also made sure that around Rs15 trillion worth of Rs1000 and Rs500 notes have come back to the system in 50 days in the biggest ever currency swap programme in the world.In his address to the nation on 31 December, a day after the banks closed the currency swap window, respecting the autonomy of the banks, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed to them to move beyond their traditional priorities, and keep the poor, the lower middle class, and the middle class at the focus of their activities. He announced cheaper home loans for the poor, 30 million debit cards for farmers, doubling the amount of loan (taken from banks as well as non-banking finance companies) to be underwritten by the government and higher fund flow to the small industrial units, among other things. The budget may have many more such schemes for rural development and employment generation but we need a healthy banking system to implement such schemes.ALSO READ | Budget 2017: Ten things to look out forThe RBIs December Financial Stability Report has pointed out that the gross non-performing loans of the Indian banking industry rose to 9.1% in September 2016 from 7.8% in March, pushing the overall stressed loans to 12.3% from 11.5% and it will rise further. While these reflect the health of the industry, the state of affairs in the public sector banks is far worse. Their stressed loans are at least 16%, more than three times than that of private banks. In fact, the report has said that the public sector banks may record the highest bad loans and lowest capital adequacy ratio, a measurement of capital against risk-weighted assets, among all banks. Has the government done anything meaningful to address these issues?The government had held an offsite with the banking bosses, Gyan Sangam, in Pune, in January 2015. Addressing the bankers, Modi had said it was a unique initiative and the first step towards catalyzing transformation. In August 2015, finance minister Arun Jaitley announced the grand Indradhanush planthe solution to the problems of the industry, which Modi explored in Gyan Sangam. It promised to tackle several critical issues, including appointments, capitalization, stress in the system, empowerment, accountability and governance reforms to revamp functioning of the government-owned banks.Estimating the capital requirement between fiscal year 2015 and 2019 at around Rs1.8 trillion, assuming 12-15% growth in bank credit, the government has committed to pump in Rs70,000 crore in phases till 2019 when the new Basel norms kick in. It also feels that the public sector banks (PSBs) market valuations will improve significantly following governance reforms, tight bad loan management and risk controls, significant operating improvements and, of course, capital allocation in successive budgets. Higher valuations, coupled with sale of non-core assets as well as improvement in performance would enable these banks to raise money from the market, the government had said.It also issued a circular that said there would be no interference from the government and the banks would be encouraged to take their decisions independently, keeping the commercial interest of the organization in mind.A government note describes the Indradhanush framework for transforming the PSBs as the most comprehensive reform effort undertaken since banking nationalisation in 1970 adding, Our PSBs are now ready to compete and flourish in a fast-evolving financial services landscape. If indeed setting up of the Banks Board Bureau with a string of vague and ambiguous terms, splitting the top post in PSBs between chairman and managing director and CEO and appointing a few private sector bankers as heads of PSBs are meaningful reforms, then Indradhanush has done wonders.Even though the credit growth has been far lower than what has been estimated, the banks would need higher capital as growing bad assets are eating into their capital but none has any idea whats happening on that front. The banks are required to set aside money or provide for their bad assets and that erodes their capital.As far as the Banks Board Bureau is concerned, I wonder whether even the members of the Bureau themselves know what they are expected to do. Its mandate includes selection and appointment of managing director and CEOs as well as non-executive chairman of PSBs, helping banks develop a robust leadership succession plan for critical positions, advising the government on the formulation and enforcement of a code of conduct and ethics for bank executives, and helping banks develop business strategies and capital raising plan, among others.Barring the top level appointments, all other assignments are vague and even here, the Bureau does not have the final say. One-fifth of Indian Overseas Banks loans have turned bad and it has recorded losses for six successive quarters till December (to the tune of Rs5,786.63 crore) but it doesnt have either the chairman or a managing director and CEO for seven months since its last boss retired in June 2016. Apparently, the Bureau recommended the executive director of a PSB for this position and it was cleared by the vigilance authoritya necessary precondition for any top appointment in a PSBbut a division of the finance ministry shot it down. Clearly, there is a disconnect between the ministry and the Bureau.The Bureau also recommended nine candidates for the posts of executive directors in various PSBs in September, but none of them has been appointed as yet. Moreover, it does not have the power to appoint the so-called non-official directors at boards of PSBs, many of whom are the root cause of mis-governance in banks.The governments plan to dilute ownership in IDBI Bank has also gone nowhere. Similarly, the employee stock option plan or ESOPs for PSBs remains a promise on paper so far.In sum, barring a few cosmetic changes, nothing significant has been done to revive the public sector banks. I would love to see finance minister Arun Jaitley using this budget to move forward with a concrete reform agenda.

				The proposed merger will create the nations largest telecom firm with combined revenue of Rs78,000 crore and a 43% share of the market hitherto dominated by Bharti Airtel Ltd, which reported annual revenue of Rs50,008 crore from local telecom operations in the last financial year.Vodafone confirms that it is in discussion with the Aditya Birla Group about an all share merger of Vodafone India (excluding Vodafones 42% stake in Indus Towers) and Idea, British company Vodafone Group said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange on Monday.With Vodafone India Ltds tower unit out of the proposed merger, Vodafone Group and the Aditya Birla Group will be almost equal partners. The two would have equal rights in the new company, said Idea.ALSO READ | Vodafones idea for an escape route from its Indian tormentThe consolidation has been triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, in which parent Reliance Industries Ltd has invested a staggering $25 billion.Since the launch of its services in September, Jio has offered free voice and data and signed up more than 72 million users, forcing rivals, including Vodafone India and Idea, to slash tariffs in response.Vodafone Group had to write off 5 billion in its Indian business last year and defer a proposed share sale which will become irrelevant should the merger go through; Idea is already listed on the exchanges and the merged entity will automatically be listed.ALSO READ | Ideas shares surge on Vodafone merger talks, so do AirtelsWhen a rival with deep pockets enters the market with an investment as huge as Rs1.5 trillion, and starts offering free services, it is bound to put pressure on others, said Ajay Bodke, chief executive and chief portfolio manager at brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt.

The combination will also give the merged entity substantial spectrum musclenearly 28% of the spectrum in the key Delhi and Mumbai markets where Idea has a weak footprint.ALSO READ | Airtel may lose market leaders position, courtesy Vodafone-Idea merger, Jio entryThe telecom department rules restricting an entitys holding to no more than 50% of the spectrum in a given band and 25% of the spectrum assigned in a circle would mean that the merged entity would have to surrender spectrum in Kerala in the 900 megahertz (MHz) band and in Gujarat and Maharashtra in the 2,500MHz band. The merged entity could sell the additional spectrum in almost five circles to Airtel or Jio. We believe that a potential Idea/Vodafone merger could make strategic sense (move to No.1 market share, scale/synergy benefits, and complementary footprint with Vodafone strong in urban areas and Idea strong in rural areas), Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note on Monday. The brokerage suggested that the merged entity would realize an increased Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of 9-12% as a result of synergies in operating expenditure arising from the merger.Jios entry has also forced rivals to make huge investments, leading to mounting debts for all operators.With current level of wafer-thin margins, it is uneconomical to invest more in acquiring contiguous territories, spectrum or upgrade into 4G or LTE technology. Hence, consolidation is inevitable, said Singapore-based Sanjay Guglani, chief investment officer at Silverdale Funds.Ideas net debt is expected to cross Rs55,000 crore by the end of March 2017. Its second-quarter profit for financial year 2017 fell 88% to Rs91 crore from Rs762 crore in the year ago period. Analysts says that Ideas December quarter performance could be worse.

				Americas clean-energy iconthe founder of Tesla Motors and SpaceXriled up many of his supporters this weekend by offering a decidedly tepid criticism of President Donald Trumps executive order restricting immigrants and refugees from seven predominantly Muslim nations.He sent a quick follow-up message that was a bit more direct, but it wasnt shared by as many people.ALSO READ | Elon Musk asks Twitter followers for advice on Trumps immigration orderAs thousands of angry protesters descended on airports and federal courthouses around the nation to decry the ban and prevent refugees from being sent home, Musk kept on tweeting. It only made things worse. He even offered to take suggestions for possible amendments to Trumps Strategic and Policy Forum.Some people had some thoughts to share. And even a few amendments. Since Friday, his Trump-related tweets have attracted almost 10,000 direct replies by anti-Trump protesters, some who call themselves the Resistance. A call for input, of course, only invites internet meme-ing in situations like this, and it reminded everyone online that Musk is participating in two advisory roles for the new administration, and that hes publicly supported Rex Tillerson, the former CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp., for Secretary of State. Thats an especially controversial endorsement from a man who has pledged his lifes work to getting humanity off fossil fuels. The resistance to it all was fierce ...and relentless ...and in some cases, harsh. Twitter dogpiles are rarely a venue for nuance. If they were, one might note that Musk is a unique case, perhaps in all American business leadership, that might invite at least a little consideration from the left. First, hes devoted his considerable fortune to advance clean energy. Tesla single-handedly forced the automotive industry to take electric vehicles seriously, and its Model 3 electric car is the leading contender to become the first mass-market EV. Musk was also chairman and biggest investor in SolarCity, the biggest US installer of rooftop solar, before Tesla acquired the company outright.ALSO READ | US colleges to Donald Trump: Keep outOne of his biggest goals all along, was to make clean-energy alternatives mainstream, to break down the partisan ideology of electric car-buying by making plugin cars that are the fastest and coolest vehicles money can buy. His solar roof tiles are groundbreaking technology, and his unique solar financing model removed financial barriers to help people start saving money from day one. The goal was to make clean energy products that were no-brainers, regardless of a persons politicsand that might just be his greatest contribution yet. From a more practical standpoint, Musk is also the founder of SpaceX, and as such has everything to lose by alienating Trump. SpaceX has revolutionized space travel for the 21st century: Musk built the only American-made rocket engine available at the time and the only alternative to Russian engines (which America had become wholly dependent on). Though SpaceX cut the cost of space travel dramatically, it still relies on US contracts and access to government spaceports. National security rules around rockets are severe: SpaceX, for example, isnt allowed to hire foreign nationals. Its a source of frustration for Musk, who is himself an immigrant from South Africa, but a feud with an easily agitated White House could endanger all of his spacefaring aspirations.ALSO READ | Speak now, or be forever damnedStarting a war of words with Trump might make some supporters feel good, but at what cost? Would harsh words help refugees? Unlikely. Musk, after all, has proven that hes not particularly good at politics.

Musks response: The Make-America-Great vibe here probably wont win back any of the Twitter users calling for a Tesla boycott.

267,0.24745,"Vodafone Group Plc has said it is considering a merger of its Indian subsidiary with Idea Cellular Ltd. If the two companies agree, they will settle for a reverse merger, obviating the need for an IPO (initial public offering) by Vodafone India Ltd.
ALSO READ | Vodafone confirms Idea merger talks, could create Indias biggest telecom firmInvestors in telecom stocks, who had turned wary after Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds relentless onslaught, lapped up the news of possible consolidation in the sector. The market capitalization of Vodafone India, Idea Cellular and Bharti Airtel Ltd cumulatively rose by $4 billion on Monday. Shares of Idea Cellular and Bharti Airtel are now 4-5% higher compared to levels before Reliance Jios launch. While its true that a merger can result in meaningful synergies, investors are perhaps being overly sanguine about the sectors prospects post-consolidation.An analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage firm points out, Competitive intensity doesnt merely depend on the number of companies fighting for share; it largely depends on the strategy of the most credible challenger in the fight for market share. In other words, Reliance Jio will still hold the key to the sectors competitive dynamics.In fact, if the Vodafone India-Idea Cellular combine materializes, it may well inspire more competitive moves by Reliance Jio. Klaus Uhlenbruck et al., researchers based in the US, say in a paper titled Rivals reactions to mergers and acquisitions: Under conditions where rivals have significant resources to respond to a competitors acquisition or when rivals consider an acquisition to be a threat to their market position, they respond with a heightened number of actions, perhaps with greater breadth and complexity. On that note, besides Reliance Jio, even Bharti Airtel has the capacity to use significant resources to respond to the new market structure. Vodafones idea for an escape route from its Indian tormentAnd they might well have an upper hand, as Vodafone India and Idea Cellular navigate the troubled waters of integrating two very large companies. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a 24 January note to clients, The focus of a merged entity could shift toward integration, thus diverting management attention from market dynamics. We believe that both Vodafone and Idea are behind Airtel and Jio in their 4G rollout strategy and any resulting material delay in rollout would lead to some market share loss in the long run. See chart for a previous M&A (merger and acquisition) involving Vodafone that faced integration issues. While Ebitda margins have improved lately, the joint venture continues to report net losses.  Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.Of course, all of this is not to say that a Vodafone India-Idea Cellular merger doesnt make sense. Reliance Jios enormous investment in the sectoraround $30 billion for an industry with revenues of $27 billionis driving down profits and cash flow of incumbents on the one hand, and forcing them to up investments on the other. As a result, for companies such as Idea Cellular, leverage will soon reach alarming proportions.A merger will result in a stronger balance sheet, and can potentially result in higher profit margins. As such, it will provide the merged company more firepower to take on Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel. Having said this, it is too much to expect it to be a panacea. Since Vodafone India and Idea Cellular are both behind the curve in terms of investments and their broadband network rollouts, they have little time to lose. The success of the merger will depend largely on the structure the new company adopts. While an organization structure that allows nimble moves is an imperative, it remains to be seen if this is possible in a company that has two large investors with equal rights.",2017-01-31,ZL7jov9xOFIyVndDXEMN7K,The likely merger of Vodafone  and Idea may well inspire more competitive moves by Reliance Jio,07:44,A Vodafone and Idea merger is no panacea for the telecom sector

What is it? The estimated combined revenue of a proposed merger of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular.Why is it important? The all-share merger will create Indias largest telecom company, larger than the Rs-50,008-crore-earning Bharti Airtel. Debt on both the companies books and likely losses incurred from the tariff-reduction race started by Reliance Jio are being seen as triggers for the move.

234,0.245025,"New Delhi: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) spending by Indian companies saw a sharp increase in FY16, according to a report released on Monday by CRISIL Foundationthe philanthropic arm of credit-rating company CRISIL.
				   
				The report analysed 1,505 companies out of the 4,887 BSE-listed firms that qualify for CSR spending under the CSR Rules, which came into force on 1 April 2014. The rules direct all companies with a net worth of Rs500 crore or revenue of Rs1,000 crore or net profit of Rs5 crore to spend 2% of their average profit in the past three years on social development.The report shows an increase in the number of firms that are in compliance with CSR Rules and thus the rise in spending, as Mint reported earlier.ALSO READ:  Firms ramp up CSR focus on healthcare, poverty, hungerThe report states that the key focus areas of CSR spending in FY16 were education, skill development, healthcare and sanitationsimilar to those seen among the top 100 National Stock Exchange firms last year in September.CRISIL Foundations analysis shows overall spending increased by a significant 22%, with the bulk of the funds going to education, skill development, healthcare and sanitation initiatives. Average spending rose 29 basis points to 1.64% as compared with 1.35% in FY15, the report said. In absolute terms, the total money spent rose by Rs2,500 crore to Rs8,300 crore in FY16. There were two reasons for the 22% jump in adherence by the larger companiesfirms are overcoming the challenge of large-scale interventions, which takes more time and effort, and they are using implementing agencies, mainly non-governmental organisations, for execution, suggests the report.Among the trend shifts between FY15 and FY16 is the focus of firms on ensuring impact. Ashu Suyash, managing director and CEO, CRISIL suggests that firms are looking to make a difference as a shift was seen towards outcome-based projects in FY16. This is indeed the way to go, as underlined by the Effective Altruism movement worldwide where, instead of doing what feels right, (companies) find the best causes to work on by using empirical evidence and analysis, he says.FY16 was the second year of the CSR Rules being in force and 1,505 companies of the 4,887 listed on the BSE, qualified for CSR spending. Of these, 77%, or 1,158 companies, reported their CSR activities, compared with 1,024 companies, or 75% of the 1,300 eligible in FY15.The higher spend is being seen as a positive step towards increasing private sector involvement in social development.Ramraj Pai, president, CRISIL Foundation, says, The public-private complementarity is great to see because, as a percentage of total government expenditure, India spends significantly less than what other BRICS nations do. So the private sector ramping up where government spending is low is truly synergistic CSR.",2017-01-31,VBRqDSfkqBfq4b8u5i9S4N,"CRISIL Foundations analysis shows overall spending increased by 22%, with the bulk of the funds going to education, skill development, healthcare and sanitation initiatives",01:34,Indian companies CSR spending up in 2015-16: Report
330,0.238975,"New Delhi: Demonetisation is likely to push back recovery in banks asset quality as the cash shortage had a disruptive impact on Indias informal economy, rating agency Fitch said on Tuesday. 
				   
				The impact of demonetisation on asset quality will start showing significantly in data for the January-March quarter, the rating agency said. Demonetisation is likely to push back the recovery in Indian banks asset quality, given the disruptive impact that cash shortages have had on the countrys large informal economy, Fitch Ratings said in a statement. Cash shortages caused by the demonetisation of large denomination currency notes have affected the income of many borrowers by holding back economic activity and reduced their short-term repayment abilities. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has allowed forbearance on some loans to the agricultural sector and small businesses, but these account for a relatively small share of outstanding lending, Fitch said. Fitch had previously expected the stressed-asset ratio for Indian banks to increase to 12% for the fiscal ending March 2017, from 11.4% in FY16.There is now a risk that the ratio will climb higher. We still believe that asset-quality indicators are close to their weakest level and will recover slowly over the next few years, but any turnaround is likely to have been pushed back by at least two quarters, it said. Demonetisation has also weighed on loan growth, at least in the short term as demand weakened in the uncertain economic environment and banks have had to focus on cash management instead of normal lending activities. Loan growth slowed to 4.8% in November 2016, from 6.7% in October. We now think it is likely that loan growth will be below our previous forecast of 10% in FY17 and may even slow from the 8.8% recorded in FY16, Fitch said. Banks have received a surge of low-cost funds as demonetised notes were deposited. Deposit growth accelerated to 15.9% year-on-year in November, from 9.2% in October, and the handful of banks that have released figures for the October-December quarter have reported low-cost deposit growth of 25-30% y-o-y. We think there is scope for further lending rate cuts, but much will depend on the proportion of new deposits that remains in the banking system. The lasting impact on bank depositsand lending rateswill become clear only after withdrawal limits are lifted, Fitch added. The government had demonetised Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes on 8 November 2016. It had then asked holders of such notes to deposit in bank accounts. Since then an estimated Rs15 trillion have been deposited in banks.",2017-01-31,joTtgqEftg3NTUjx0DVpQM,"The impact of demonetisation on asset quality will start showing significantly in data for the January-March quarter, says Fitch",11:39,Demonetisation may delay banks asset quality recovery: Fitch

23,0.239125,"The board of Infosys Ltd has inducted director D.N. Prahlad into the nomination and remuneration committee (NRC) that oversees the nomination process and the incentives and pay offered to its senior-most executives, including the chief executive.
				   
				Prahlad, a relative of Infosys founder N.R. Narayana Murthy, will now be one of the five members of the current NRC, according to two executives familiar with the development; the decision may make it more difficult for the management to award higher salaries to its senior executives. Infosyss nomination and remuneration panel is headed by independent director and professor Jeffrey Lehman, and includes three independent directors: Biocon chairman and managing director Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw,  Stanford University provost John Etchemendy and non-executive chairman R. Seshasayee.An Infosys spokesperson declined to comment. The induction of Prahladwhose appointment as independent director in October did not go down well with proxy advisory firmsinto the NRC is significant for two reasons.Firstly, Murthy publicly expressed unhappiness last year with the boards decision to increase CEO Vishal Sikkas compensation to $11 million a year from the earlier $7.08 million. In April, only 23.57% of promoter votes were cast in favour of a resolution reappointing Sikka as managing director and CEO and increasing his compensation by 55% to $11 million a year. With Prahlad, also a former employee of the company, on the NRC, Infosys will find it challenging to further increase Sikkas compensation.Finally, Sikkas revised compensation of $11 million includes $4 million to be paid in cash and $7 million in stock. The $4 million cash component includes a base pay of $1 million and $3 million performance-based pay. The $7 million stock compensation includes $2 million to be paid over the year and $5 million in stock to be based on the companys performance in a year. For the current year, Infosys has already paid Sikka $2 million in stock.The Infosys board has linked Sikkas $11 million compensation to the progress the company makes in becoming a $20 billion firm by March 2021. However, Infosys does not disclose the annual targets based on which Sikka will be awarded the $8 million variable or performance-based pay. For the current year, Infosys expects at-best 7.6% dollar revenue growth, which is lower than last years growth of 9.1%, and with Prahlads induction in the NRC, many believe Sikka will not get the entire component of the variable pay. I dont think the board will now be that bold or brave enough to again increase the CEOs compensation, said a senior Infosys executive on condition on anonymity. Now with Prahlad on the remuneration and nominations committee, Murthy will have some say in how CEO will be paid the variable pay for this year.A proxy advisory firm again flagged concerns about Prahlads appointment, this time on the NRC. First, Infosys should have made this disclosure of this appointment of D.N. Prahlad on the NRC. Second, we continue to believe that Prahlad is not an independent director because of his close proximity and relationship with Narayana Murthy and for these reasons, this decision by the company should be questioned by shareholders, said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of InGovern Research Services.",2017-01-31,3oSFJ7P00Bb3RAgOIOjkMK,"With D.N.

361,0.23575,"Mumbai: Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has pared its holdings in Tata group firms, fearing that a potentially long legal battle between Tata Sons Ltd and its ousted chairman Cyrus P. Mistry will erode its investments. 
				   
				Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and mutual funds have been more optimistic, with the latter increasing their ownership in 12 Tata group firms and cutting their stake in seven. In the December quarter, state-run LIC, Indias biggest investor, cut its stakes in seven out of the 11 Tata group firms it owns stakes in, according to stock exchange data. Twenty-seven Tata group firms are listed. FPIs slashed holdings in nine and increased their holdings in nine Tata group firms. LIC cut its stake by the most in Tata Chemicals Ltd, where it reduced its holding by 73 basis points (bps) to 2.59%. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. In Tata Global Beverages Ltd, it slashed its holdings by 60 bps and by 35 bps in Tata Communications Ltd. Titan Co. Ltd and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd are the only Tata group firms in which LIC increased its stakes during this period.Overall, the value of LICs holdings in listed Tata firms came down by Rs2,371 crore or 6.4% between 24 October, when the Tata Sons board suddenly ousted Mistry, and the end of December. In comparison, the entire market capitalization of Tata listed firm fell by 7.6%.  A lot of things that were kept under wraps have come to the fore after the Tata-Mistry dispute started. So, from an FPI point of view, especially when US markets have started looking up, there is not much reason for them to stay heavily invested in Tata firms for the time being, said the head of a mid-sized asset management firm, requesting anonymity. FPIs too slashed their holdings in Tata group firms such as Tata Elxsi Ltd (3.2 percentage points) and 1.9 percentage point in Tata Motors. On the flip side, foreign investors also raised their stakes in 9 firms, including Trent Ltd by 2.66 percentage points and Indian Hotels Co. Ltd (54 bps). However, given the overall decline in prices of Tata group firmsa trend mirroring the broader marketthe value of FPI holdings in Tata firms fell by 10.9%, or Rs18,131 crore, between 24 October putsch and the end of December. In the three months to December, FPIs sold $6.72 billion worth of shares.LIC is looking to slash its holdings in Tata group firms further gradually over concerns that the ongoing Tata-Mistry feud may continue for several years, diminishing returns on investments, according to two people familiar with LICs investment strategies, including an LIC official. They did not want to be named because the matter is market-sensitive. The Tata-Mistry spat has reached the doors of the National Company Law Tribunal and hearings are on from Tuesday. An email sent to LIC remained unanswered. No one knows how long this will continue and how much damage it will inflict on investments (made) by shareholders. LICs priority has always been its policyholders, said one of the two persons cited above. LIC is the countrys largest insurer with total assets of around Rs21 trillion. Mutual funds in India have, however, chosen to increase their holdings in most Tata group firms, in contrarian bets. They hold stakes in 24 listed Tata group firms, of which 12 saw an increase in MF holdings in the December quarter. During October-December, MFs increased their holding by 2.47 percentage points in Tata Steel. They reduced their stakes in seven Tata firms and the overall value of their holdings fell by 4.6%.  Tata group firms have created a strong brand and these companies are capable of delivering value over a period of time.

186,0.249825,"The Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) have prompted an interesting change in the way companies look at their assets. Following the transition to the new norms, companies assets have seen wide-scale revaluation, resulting in significant profit increases for the earlier quarter as companies restate those results as per the new accounting norms to compare them with the latest quarterly results.
				   
				This offers an opportunity to see how much the changes in the accounting standards have affected company financials. Moreover, the revaluation has been done in such a way that it will continue to act as a tailwind for profits in the days ahead.Property, plant and equipment (PP&E) revaluations account for the biggest adjustments to profits under Ind AS. The total immediate profit impact of adjustments to PP&E is already worth at least Rs10,776 crore, according to a Mint analysis of recent results data from 72 large firms (from among BSE 100 companies) conducted in partnership with consulting firm KPMG. All figures compare the September 2015 numbers under the old accounting standards with numbers calculated under the new rules. The total absolute value of profit adjustments made (including upward and downward revisions) was Rs19,500 crore. PP&E adjustments accounted for Rs10,776 crore or 55.26% of the changes. The equivalent adjustment made for the June quarter was a negative adjustment of Rs68.35 crore.Sai Venkateshwaran, partner and head of accounting advisory services at KPMG in India, said some companies that had written down their assets in the September 2015 quarter under the old accounting norms have revalued these assets to their fair values on transition to Ind AS. This has led to a reversal of some of the earlier write-downs in the September 2015 quarter, which has improved the profits for that quarter when restated under the new norms.ALSO READ | Transition to  Ind Asconnect the dots to see the real pictureAccording to Venkateshwaran, the new standards allow the fair value of PP&E at the date of transition to be used as its deemed cost. Many companies have used this provision to write down certain assets like plant and equipment to their fair value. On the other hand, several companies have also written up assets such as land to their fair value.The write-down of depreciable assets by some of these companies could have a significant, continuing positive impact on their profits in the days ahead, he said.What do these changes mean on the ground?Consider a firm that had total PP&E worth Rs1 lakh. The land was earlier valued at Rs25,000 and the rest of the factory worth Rs75,000. Suppose that when the company revalues it, a higher value is assigned to the land (say Rs60,000) and a lower amount to the rest (Rs40,000 in our example). The non-land portion sees lower depreciation because of this revaluation. Assigning a higher value to land, and a lower value to other assets increases profits because of this lower depreciation. Land is not depreciated.The result of these adjustments was seen in profit gains when September 2015 results were declared.Integrated oil and gas firms made PP&E adjustments of Rs4,058 crore, according to KPMG data. Firms making iron and steel and intermediate products made similar adjustments of Rs7,091.5 crore (see Chart 1).The iron and steel companies saw their profits more than triple to Rs5,705 crore under the new norms. This makes the sector one of the key gainers profit-wise because of net adjustments under the new norms (Rs3,801 crore). Another gainer is the integrated oil and gas segment, which saw profits rise by Rs2,625 crore to Rs9,345 crore.Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities Ltd, said a number of firms have had to mark down their fixed assetsPP&E against reserves, because the new regulations require these assets to be valued at a level which correctly reflects their remaining useful life. This would have had a negative impact on their net worth, which would have adverse implications for firms carrying high debt.ALSO READ | Profiting from new accounting standardsThese companies probably looked at old value land on their books and revalued it upwards by crediting their reserves to markup their net worth, he said.Independent market analyst Anand Tandon said, The accounting standard allows revaluation, so some of this is inevitable. You have to assume that companies will report as per their convenience.The largest adjustments were made by Tata Steel Ltd. Its profits were revised upwards to the tune of Rs7,463.02 crore because of PP&E adjustments. Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) made PP&E adjustments to its profits worth Rs4,058 crore, according to second-quarter results. (Third-quarter results showed zero such adjustments for the December 2015 numbers).Tata Steel did not respond to email, text and telephonic requests for comment.RIL said it had to revise certain assets downwards to abide by the new regulations. At the same time, it revised its land assets upwards and also the impairment of exploration and production assets because of the change in rules.Land which had been acquired over the decades and held at its historical acquisition cost, has been revalued upwards to reflect its fair value on the balance sheet without causing any impact on reported earnings, said an RIL spokesperson.In case of exploration and production assets, the new norms said they should be accounted for using the successful efforts method instead of using full costs, leading to a reversal in impairment taken, the spokesperson added (see Chart 2).The new accounting standards negatively impacted sectors such as commercial vehicles, and breweries and distilleries too. The latter saw profits erode by Rs854 crore. Commercial vehicle companies saw their losses increase from Rs143 crore to Rs1,589 crore.The reconciliation numbers are based on profits as defined by the company. Some firms may use profit numbers after adjusting for minority interest, others would not. There is no set rule for which profit numbers are used for reconciliation purposes. This is why there is a difference between adjustments by reconciliation numbers and the impact on the more well-tracked profit after tax numbers. The profit after tax number is calculated on a uniform basis across companies.Profits for the 72 companies are up by Rs1,011 crore, or 1.6%, to Rs64,321 crore.This is in spite of Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) dropping 3.72%. The overall Ebitda figure dropped to Rs1.32 trillion on account of the transition to the new accounting standards.Other factors including lower taxes also helped result in higher after-tax profits. This year is the first in which companies are following the new norms.All companies with a net worth of Rs500 crore or more have to abide by the new norms from 1 April 2016. It will apply to those with a net worth of Rs250 crore one year later. Financial institutions such as banks and non-banking financial companies will have to follow Ind AS from 1 April 2018.Whats the big deal? Companies have revised profits upwards citing PP&E (property, plant and equipment) adjustments. The value of these adjustments is already in excess of Rs10,000 crore, shows the latest quarterly comparison. A look into the changes show that they are the outcome of balance-sheet adjustments made after the new accounting standards came into effect. Experts says many companies have had to revise some assets downwards because of stringent new norms.This would have affected net worth of already indebted companies. So, some have chosen to revise land value upwards to preserve net worth, resulting in the changes seen. This in turn is reflected in the latest disclosed financials. An analysis of financials shows that land has been given higher value and other assets are valued lower. This will lower depreciation and increase profit numbers in the days ahead as well.",2017-01-31,PxA2QFXfQ5hkiS9egHPXfM,"Property, plant and equipment revaluations account for the biggest adjustments to profits of 72 large BSE 100 companies under Ind AS, finds a Mint-KPMG analysis",01:31,"The Rs10,000 crore profit adjustment"

				Comparatively the country as a whole has seen a growth of 5.1% during the period. Consumption is high in states where rainfall is low. Tamil Nadu, which has been declared drought-hit by the state government, saw a 12% rise in electricity usage. Karnataka, which also saw scanty rains, has seen a 10% rise in power usage, points out Motilal Oswal, citing data from Central Electricity Authority.CSR adoption by Indian companies on the riseThe spending of listed Indian companies on corporate social responsibility (CSR) is rising and the proportion of firms spending closer to 2% of profits is going up, according to a report by Crisil Foundation. Spending on CSR was up by 22% in fiscal year 2016 over a year ago. Larger companies reported improved compliance, with 53% of those with sales of over Rs10,000 crore spending 2% or more of profit on CSR during FY16, compared to 31% in the year earlier. Among smaller firms, 57% with sales of Rs100-500 crore and 56% with sales of Rs500-10,000 crore reported spending 2% or more. Of course, this can also be seen as a cup half empty, as there is a long way to go before a majority of companies become compliant with the 2% spending rule.

				Net profit stood at Rs2,441.82 crore, as against Rs3,018.13 crore a year earlier, marginally lower than estimates. According to a Bloomberg poll of 20 analysts, the bank was expected to post a net profit of Rs2,466.7 crore for the quarter.The earnings are in line with expectations, said Siddharth Purohit, senior research analyst with brokerage firm Angel Broking Ltd. Earnings will remain muted for next couple of quarters.ICICI Bank shares fell 0.7% to Rs268.95 on Tuesday, paring this years gains to 5.4%.

As a percentage of total loans, gross bad loans stood at 7.9% at the end of December, up from 6.82% at the end of the previous quarter. Bad loans net of provisions were 4.35% of advances. During the three months ended December, Rs 7057 crore worth of fresh loans turned bad, lower than the previous two quarters. About 40% of these were from a so-called watchlist the bank released in March. ICICI Banks managing director and chief executive officer Chanda Kochchar said the watch list, which includes sub-investment grade loans given to troubled sectors, declined to Rs.27,536 crore at the end of December from Rs 44,065 crore nine months earlier. Around Rs 12,057 crore worth of loans from the watch list went bad and Rs 4165 crore worth of loans were resolved during the last nine months.Rise in bad loans had a dampening effect on net interest income in the quarter, Hatim Broachwala, an analyst at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities told Bloomberg. The banks ability to prevent any further deterioration in asset quality in the slowing economy is going to be the key to profit growth in coming quarters.Net interest income (NII), or the core income a bank earns by giving loans, fell by 1.64% to Rs5,363.35 crore as loan growth slowed owing to the effects of demonetisation and the rise in bad loans.At the end of December, ICICI Banks advances rose 5.21% to Rs4.57 trillion.To be sure, ICICI Bank is not the only bank bearing the brunt of rising bad loans and slowing advances. Earlier in January, HDFC Bank Ltd reported its weakest quarterly profit growth in at least 20 years. Rival Axis Bank Ltd said net profit for the December quarter fell 73.4% while its gross bad loans ratio jumped by 1 percentage point over the last three months.It is very difficult to give any guidance on resolution of stressed assets as there are too many moving parts involved, Kochhar said on a conference call with reporters. Our endeavour is to resolve as much as we can in this year itself.ICICI Banks non-interest income fell 6.61% from a year ago to Rs 3938. 31 crore.

Revenue rose 16.8% to Rs5,158.42 crore from Rs4,481.20 crore in the year-ago period as the company added planes and operated more flights. IndiGo controls about 39% share of the domestic market, with 126 planes and 854 daily flights. In an analyst call on Tuesday, IndiGo said its yields or airfares were down 10% in October, 20% in November, 17% in December and 10% in January year-on-year. IndiGo president Aditya Ghosh said the airline will continue to match the fares of rival airlines in each fare bucket in the coming months as wella strategy started in the second half of last year. We have the lowest cost structure, Ghosh said.During the quarter, 71.7% of IndiGo flights were on time. The airline said its operational performance was impacted primarily due to adverse weather conditions, air traffic congestion at key airports and operational issues associated with its A320neo planes.IndiGo has bet big on the A320neos Pratt & Whitney engine. The new engine has been throwing up challenges including startup issues and erroneous technical messages to the pilot since last year when some of the planes were inducted after a long delay. Some other issues are also being fixed, IndiGo said on Tuesday.There are certain issues with combustor chamber lining as a result of which we are not getting the engine life that we would have expected, Ghosh said, adding There is a redesign that Pratt is implementing to fix this. It has also talked about an issue with the oil seal that have seen some failures. Pratt is working on it. He said the delayed delivery of fan blades for the neo engines is also being addressed. The engine is giving 15% fuel savings compared with 14% earlier, he added.The airline expects to end fiscal year 2017 with a fleet of 133 planes and may induct more next fiscal than initially expected, it said.Consulting firm CAPA said IndiGos net profit per passenger dropped 47.5% to Rs430 in the December quarter from Rs820 a year earlier and predicted challenges to profitability next fiscal.Industry will add 60-65 aircraft in FY18 which will increase supply dynamics significantly and with cost creep of over 10% likely, see emerging profitability challenges, CAPA said.

331,0.238275,"Mumbai: The proposed merger between Vodafone and Idea can fetch the combined entity upto 350 basis points in cost savings, even though the move is unlikely to lead to better pricing power for operators in the short-term, says a report. International rating agency Fitch on Wednesday therefore retained its negative outlook on the sector, citing that fierce competition and rising capex will put pressure on most operators in 2017. 
				   
				We expect the merger of Idea with Vodafone can improve the combined Ebidta margin by 250-350 bps due to cost savings, mainly on network and marketing expenses. The combined entity will also have a more balanced subscriber mix, as Vodafone is strong in urban areas while Idea focuses more on the rural market, Fitch said in a note today. We estimate the merger would create an entity with 390 million subscribers, a leading revenue market share of around 40%, revenue of USD 11 billion and an Ebidta margin of 28-30%, it said. However, the merger can create significant opportunities for capex savings by eliminating duplicate network investments and avoiding future spectrum auctions, as the combined entity will have sufficient spectrum to expand 3G/4G services across the circles. An all-share merger along with a possible equity injection will strengthen the combined entitys balance sheet and provide flexibility for more capex, it said, and noted that Ideas balance sheet is stretched now with debt-equity ratio of about five times or at about Rs34,000 crore.

The price of crude oil in the Indian energy basket has increased from $39.9 in April 2016 to $52.7 in December 2016.The Indian energy basket represents the average of Oman, Dubai and Brent crude. The price was $54.63 per barrel on Friday.The state-owned firms in the oil and gas sector are; Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC), Oil India Ltd, GAIL (India) Ltd, Indian Oil Corp., Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Numaligarh Refinery Ltd, Chennai Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Engineers India Ltd,  Balmer Lawrie & Co. Ltd, and Biecco Lawrie Co. Ltd.We see opportunities to strengthen our CPSEs (central public sector enterprises) through consolidation, mergers and acquisitions. By these methods, the CPSEs can be integrated across the value chain of an industry. It will give them capacity to bear higher risks, avail economies of scale, take higher investment decisions and create more value for the stakeholders. Possibilities of such restructuring are visible in the oil and gas sector, Jaitley said.The concern over crude oil prices stems from Indias energy import bill of around $150 billion, expected to reach $300 billion by 2030. India imports around 80% of its crude oil and 18% of its natural gas requirements. India imported 202 million tonnes of oil in 2015-16.The state owned firms welcomed the move.Though the finer details are yet to come but the intention appears to form an integrated company on the lines of integrated oil firms such as ExxonMobil, Shell and BP, said Dinesh K.

217,0.2495,"Mumbai: Going by the slew of measures announced in the Union budget on Wednesday, such as targeting digital transformation while discouraging cash transactions, its easy to be lulled into believing that India is well on its way to becoming a digital powerhouse.
				   
				And why not? After all, finance minister Arun Jaitley did unveil a series of post-demonetisation digital reforms, including a Rs3 lakh cap on cash transactions, which he said were aimed at fetching the government Rs2,500 crore in revenue. While the initiatives to build a digital India are undoubtedly important, we cannot ignore the fact that India has a long way to go becoming digital. Here are a few reasons:For one, India still ranks a poor 91 on the Networked Readiness Index (NRI) 2016a key component of the World Economic Forums The Global Information Technology Report 2016. The report assesses the state of networked readiness of 139 economies using the NRI and examines the role of information and communication technologies (ICT) in driving innovation. It is thus a key tool in assessing a countrys preparedness to reap the benefits of emerging technologies and capitalize on the opportunities presented by the digital transformation.Also read: Budget 2017: Arun Jaitley unveils series of post-demonetisation digital reformsThe 2016 edition of the NRI placed Singapore at the top of the list of countries when it comes to networked readiness. Finland, which topped the ranking in 2014, came second for the second year in a row, followed by Sweden, Norway and the US, which climbed two places. The remaining top 10 comprised the Netherlands, Switzerland, the UK, Luxembourg and Japan. Networked readiness, therefore, is correlated to per-capita income.Not only was India ranked 91 among 138 countries in 2016, but WEFs figures also showed that India had actually fallen 23 places in the NRI ranking in the last four years. In 2013, when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government was in power, India was ranked 68 on the index out of 144 countries. When the Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government took over in May 2014, the ranking slipped to 83 out of 148 countries. In 2015, Indias ranking fell to 89 out of 143 countries. And in 2016, it slipped two places to 91 out of 138 countries.While Indias absolute score has changed only marginally in recent years, other countries are racing ahead at faster speeds. Lack of infrastructure and low levels of skills among the population remain the key bottlenecks to widespread ICT adoption, especially in terms of individual usageissues that governments have attempted to address over the last 10 years.Also read: Union Budget 2017: The winners and losersAs the WEF report pointed out in its 2016 edition, a deep divide persists between well-connected metropolitan hubs and remote rural areas, which lack even the most basic infrastructure. This implies that BharatNets implementation track record needs to significantly improve for the benefits to reach rural India.Second, Indias spirited talk about becoming a cashless economy happened when the Indian government invalidated high-value banknotes on the night of 8 November, taking out 86% of the currency in circulation by value. It was supposed to be a war on unaccounted and untaxed wealth, counterfeit notes and terror financing. Instead, as serpentine queues formed outside bank branches and automated teller machines (ATMs) went dry for days and weeks together, the slogan changed. It became all about promoting a cashless or at least a less-cash culture in an economy where almost 90% of transactions are paid for in cash. Indians can boast about technologies such as mobile wallets, crypto-currencies such as bitcoin, mobile peer-to-peer payments, blockchain technology, payment banks and architecture such as the unified payments interface (UPI) and the recently-launched Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) app.  But the government is yet to devise a police on online security. The Indian IT Act (2008) alone will not suffice.Third, Digital Indias Rs1.3 trillion programmewhich envisages a plethora of e-governance services across sectors like healthcare, education and banking, and promises to introduce transparency in the system, reduce corruption and achieve inclusive growthwas only given the green light in 2015. And while the Modi government was simply building on the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) that was approved in 2006 under the previous government, it is obvious that digital programmes do not bear fruit overnight.Also read: Budget 2017: A minimalist approach for an evolving IndiaSmart cities are a case in point. It takes 30-40 years to build a city. Programs like Smart Cities and Make in India will require considerable investments in terms of manpower, technological upgrades, skill development, digital literacy and, most importantly, a plethora of standards to be laid out and adhered to. The Internet of Things (IoT) which entails hundreds of thousands of sensors will need interoperability of standards and security policies in place so that our smart devices, smart homes, smart grids and smart cities are not paralysed by smart cybercriminals.Fourth, while one can see tangibles like the governments Digital Locker and other e-services ride on a robust GI Cloud, also known as Meghraj, Internet speeds are poor in India despite the spread of fourth generation (4G) technology.

302,0.237375,"Mumbai: A big infrastructure spending push, the boost to affordable housing and a fiscal deficit target of 3.2% of gross domestic product announced in the Union budget came as a big boost to banks. A tax concession on provisions for bad loans also came as a relief for Indian banks which are struggling with gross non-performing assets of around Rs6.7 trillion.
				   
				Banking stocks rallied more than the broader market with the BSE Bankex gaining 2.7%, a full percentage point more than the Sensex.In the budget speech, the finance minister outlined his proposals to create more jobs and boost infrastructure spending, measures which will help increase credit offtake for banks. Government spending on this sector will touch Rs3.96 trillion in the next fiscal. As banks have been struggling with a large number of stressed cases in the infrastructure segment, fresh investments will get the ball rolling and hopefully turn around some of those companies that have been defaulting.ALSO READ: Budget 2017: Jaitley gives infrastructure a massive pushOther measures that will boost credit growth include affordable housing projects being given infrastructure status and the highest target for farm credit at Rs10 trillion. After the governments move to withdraw Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes on 8 November, bank credit growth has fallen to around 5%, the lowest in a couple of decades. Another positive announcement for the banking sector was the governments comparatively tame net market borrowing figure of Rs3.48 trillion in 2017-18, as compared with Rs4.25 trillion in the current year. The net borrowing figure takes into account the securities that will be bought back, Jaitley said.Capital expenditure data provided in the budget document reveals that the gross market borrowing is set at Rs5.8 trillion for the new financial year, which is approximately the same as 2016-17. Jaitley also said the government proposes to increase allowable provision for non-performing asset (NPA) from 7.5% to 8.5%. This will reduce the tax liability of banks, he said. Allowable provision is the amount of bad loan provision that is tax deductible.ALSO READ: Budget 2017: Affordable housing to be given infrastructure statusCapital infusion of Rs10,000 crore for recapitalization of PSU Banks will be a morale booster in scenarios where Banks are in dire need of capital for Credit growth and Basel III compliance. Further, the deductions allowed for NPA provisions made by banks have been increased upto 8.5% of the income which will act as a breather in supplementing profitability of banks, said Ashwani Kumar, chairman and managing director, Dena Bank.According to another public sector banker who spoke on conditions of anonymity, the increase in allowable provision could have been slightly higher as the banking sectors NPA troubles are very big.With some higher tax deductions, banks could have gotten a higher tax write back and that could have helped the bank books, the anonymous banker said.In the budget announcement, the finance minister also talked about allowing asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) to list the security receipts they issue against bad loans on stock exchanges registered with the Securities and Exchanges Board of India (Sebi).ALSO READ: Union Budget 2017: Key highlights and themesThis will enhance capital flows in to the securitisation industry and will particularly be helpful to deal with bank NPAs, the speech  noted.The sour note for banksthe state-owned lenderswas the lower capital infusion plan for the next fiscal. The budget has set aside only Rs10,000 crore for bank recapitalization, lower than the Rs25,000 crore figure for the current year. The Indradhanush scheme says that state-owned lenders will receive Rs70,000 crore by March 2017 as capital infusion from the government to meet their higher capital requirement under the Basel-III regime. Despite that, a gauge of state-owned bank stocks rose 4%.Overall its a neutral budget. Low fiscal deficit and lack of any populist measures like the farm loan waiver turned out to be positive for the banking stocks.

68,-0.2265,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond rose to 6.43% on Wednesday, from its previous close of 6.407%. While the finance minister was making the budget speech in Parliament, the bond yield actually dropped to 6.38%, but rose later.
				   
				The reason behind the drop was confusion about the exact size of the net government borrowing in fiscal 2018. Initially, the figure was quoted as Rs3.48 trillion against the current fiscal years Rs4.07 trillion. However, the comparison is not entirely correct as the 2018 figure does not take into account the buyback of bonds.ALSO READ | Budget 2017 gives clues about demonetisation deposits in banksAfter adjusting for buyback of bonds, the net borrowing programme in 2018 would be virtually unchangedRs3.48 trillion vs 3.47 trillion. And, without the adjustments, the comparable figures are Rs4.23 trillion in 2018 vs Rs4.07 trillion in 2017. The gross annual borrowing remains virtually unchanged at around Rs5.8 trillion. Once the mathematics was clear to the market, bond yields rose.It could be a knee-jerk reaction as ultimately, the market cannot ignore the good newsthe government is determined to contain the fiscal deficit at 3.2% of Indias gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018. This has also given rise to the hope of a rate cut in the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBI) next monetary policy on 8 February.Indeed, the fiscal discipline brightens the chances for a rate cut next week but I would still say its not a given as yetthe chance of a rate cut next week is 50:50. There could be a rate cut in coming months but it may or may not materialize next week.ALSO READ | A remarkably restrained Union budget, going by the numbersApart from the containment of fiscal deficit at 3.2% of GDP, the other factor that could influence the Monetary Policy Committee (which will have a new memberdeputy governor in charge of monetary policy Viral Acharya) that takes the call on interest rate is the drop in retail inflation to 3.41% in December from 3.63% in the previous month and 5.61% a year ago.Food inflation, which accounts for more than half of the consumer price index or CPI basket, is the driving factor and we may not see inflation going down further from here. The external factors which prevented RBI from going in for a rate cut in December have worsened since then and the impact of the so-called demonetisation is still not clear.In other words, the reasons cited by the six-member MPC for RBI for deciding against a rate cut in December are very much there and it can once again refrain from cutting the rate at its next meeting.At the first meeting of MPC in October, RBI brought down its policy rate to 6.25%.ALSO READ | Union Budget 2017: Key highlights and themesThe other reason behind a likely decision against any rate cut could be the liquidity-driven monetary transmission. Flooded with money post-demonetization, some of the banks have pared their benchmark rates by as much as 90 basis points in January. One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. Much of the money that flowed into the banking system in November and December is in the form of low-cost current and savings accounts. Banks do not pay any interest on current accounts and most pay 4% on savings accounts. With no sign of corporate credit picking up, banks have cut their loan rates for mortgages aggressively.It is for certain though that RBI will continue with its accommodative monetary policy stance. And, of course, there could be a surprise in the form of a rate cutlike the market experience in December when the MPC chose not to go for a rate cut against the consensus estimate.Tamal Bandyopadhyay, consulting editor at Mint, is adviser to Bandhan Bank.

309,-0.23195,"New Delhi/Mumbai: Desperate to develop its own mineral deposits, resource-hungry India is trying to revive investment by taking aim at illegal miners like the sand mafiafrom a few hundred feet in the air.
				   
				The government will deploy flying camera drones to track renegades who for years have been extracting everything from sand to coal to iron ore without permits. Unsanctioned diggers pay no tax, violate the mineral rights of others and employ rudimentary methods blamed for widespread environmental damage. Theyre also hard to catch, working in remote areas and sometimes getting help from corrupt officials.What happens in most of the cases is that when we reach those areas, people get a whiff of it and they run away, they remove their workers, they remove everything, said Piyush Sharma, technical secretary at Indian bureau of mines in Nagpur. Drones will be effective in a way that we will have pictures, which can be used as evidence.Rogue miners have gotten so bad that the government in 2012 shut down all iron ore pits in a western state that was the source of half Indias exports of the mineral. A judicial panel estimated illegal operators in Goa had siphoned off Rs34,940 crore ($5 billion) of ore while dumping toxic waste in rivers and farmland and destroying forest habitat. The ban turned the country from the worlds third-largest exporter of iron ore to a net importer.One of the biggest mineral thefts is sand dredged from ocean beaches and river beds. Unlicensed extraction has caused flooding and threatened marine life like the endangered Gangetic dolphin. But demand for it as a building material in cement and concrete has soared with the expanding economy. In the year that starts 1 April, the government plans to spend $59 billion to modernize railways, airports and roads. It also plans to build 10 million homes for the poor by 2019 and provide electricity to about 240 million people who dont have it.Bureaucratic barriersSand thieves arent the only problem. As growth in Asias second-largest economy fueled a surge in demand for imported raw materials, theres been a lack of investment in domestic mineral reserves. Excessive delays in getting permits led foreign companies like Rio Tinto Group and South Koreas Posco to withdraw huge projects in frustration, and Bangalore-based Deccan Gold Mines Ltd. hasnt mined a single ounce of the metal after 13 years of trying.Using unmanned aerial surveillance of mines can help restore confidence in the governments ability to protect mineral rights and control activity, according to Balvider Kumar, Indias secretary of mines. In addition to tracking the illegal miners and their trucks, the government will have another tool in helping to monitor authorized operations, determine lease boundaries and aid in exploration.In some of the states, illegal mining is a matter of concern as it is taking place on a very massive scale, Kumar said by telephone from New Delhi. Drones can help us find out how much material has been mined by a company and whether correct royalties or taxes have been paid to the government.Thats a big improvement to the current system for monitoring mines and tracking cheats that relies on local complaints and unconfirmed reports, with few ways for the government to follow up to see if action was taken, according to the ministry. The government also began a mining surveillance program in October that employs satellite and remote-sensing technology to help curb illegal activities, according to the Indian Bureau of Mines.Flying eyesEarlier this month, Tata Steel Ltd.s Noamundi iron ore mine became the first in the country to use drone technology on an area spread over 1,160 hectares (2,866 acres) in the state of Jharkhand.State-run exploration agencies and the Indian Institute of Technology are studying drone use over river beds to identify potential trouble spots. Companies also can use thermal cameras in the drones to monitor mines at night, and the technology can provide images that make it easier to map exploration areas that might otherwise take months to complete on foot.The surveillance upgrade is just part of Indias bid to encourage more mineral investment. In 2015,  Prime Minister Narendra Modi decided to switch to competitive auctions for allocating resource rights, after years of discretionary or free allotments led to bruising corruption scandals. While most companies dont like having to re-bid on deposits they find, the government says it wants a more transparent model. The process for getting licences also was simplified.Luring investmentThose are the kinds of changes that Piyush Goyal, who helped to revive the countrys coal production, expects will lure more legal investments in domestic mineral extraction. Goyal, who is the minister of state with independent charge of power, coal, new and renewable energy and mines, predicts spending will surge more than sevenfold to 1 trillion rupees over five years, doubling mine output and reducing dependence on foreign raw materials.India imports almost all of the copper concentrate it uses and is one of the worlds biggest buyers of steel, aluminum, iron ore, gold and coal, mines ministry data show. But the country has yet to fully tap mineral riches that the government estimates are on par with those of major exporters like Canada, Australia, Brazil, South Africa, Chile and Mexico, according to the Central Statistical Organization.Many of those countries are already using drone technology, as are other industries. Indonesia used them at tin mines and to track production at oil-palm and rubber plantations. China employs drones to monitor pollution, while some farmers use them to spread herbicides and photograph plants, according to the digital association Bitkom.Drones are being recognized as the technology of the future, said Sharma, the technical secretary at the Indian bureau of mines.Bloomberg",2017-02-02,fy5nTXrGWaQIIshcdz8jvL,The government will deploy flying camera drones to track renegades who for years have been extracting everything from sand to coal to iron ore without permits,15:15,Catching illegal sand men is key to make mining pay off in India

285,0.249575,"A revolution is brewing in the financial ecosystem that will extend the benefits of formal financial services to the masses. Global trends suggest that the banking and financial services sector are undergoing the change that the telecom sector witnessed a few years ago. A number of OTT (over-the-top) players came up with innovative solutions to provide a comprehensive communication experience. They leveraged the infrastructure created by telecom service providers and provided value-added services to consumers. Similar innovation is happening in payments and other financial services.
				   
				Traditionally, the banking system has had a stringent regulatory environment. This is beginning to change as regulators take cognizance of the innovation in the area. Companies providing value-added services over and above bank accounts for customers are getting good traction. These companies are coming up with constantly improving technology, data analytics and lean processes to provide high-quality services at an economical cost. Financial services can be divided broadly into two segments. The first category consists of frequently used services like payments, cash in, cash out, etc. These services will witness innovation in the area of customer experience. For example, payment being made through a QR (quick response) code-based solution enhances the experience of making a payment and has the potential of reducing a consumers reliance on cash. The second category consists of long-haul services like lending, insurance and cash management. This category will witness innovation that can extend the reach of these services to the masses. A company giving a personal loan based on utility-bill payment history or extending a working capital loan to a merchant based on its digital transaction history comes in this category. Companies are banking on their ability to provide such services to a hitherto untouched market. In India, the pace of this change is even more rapid due to the favourable combination of a government policy environment, a progressive banking regulator and the emergence of innovative fintech companies. The percolation of financial services to every citizen will happen the way it did with telecom services. The pace will only accelerate. Aadhaar is going to play an important role in this change. Innovation and regulation balance out each other and grow together. Innovation solves restrictions and regulation sets boundaries to safeguard consumers. When both innovation and the regulatory environment move in sync, the service delivery goes to the next level. The emergence of wallets, payment banks and small finance banks is the result of such synchronous movement of innovation and regulation.A large segment of the population will enjoy the benefits of formal financial services for the first time. The first step in this direction has already been taken with Jan Dhan accounts. Digital payments through various instruments like wallets, UPI (unified payment interface), cards, etc, are growing consistently. The last few months have demonstrated that consumers are willing to become digitally savvy if the right solutions are provided. A critical mass of consumers and merchants is getting comfortable with digital payments and apprehensions have reduced significantly in a short span. This is leading to a network effect and unprecedented growth in the digital ecosystem.Digital payments are leading to access to credit through formal channels for consumers and merchants who were unable to get this benefit till now. There is similar innovation in the areas of insurance and wealth management, where the focus is on increasing penetration of these services. For, services like wealth management have remained limited to a select segment. Technology companies are developing ways to provide such services to consumers irrespective of the quantum of their wealth. This is being made possible through technology innovation that renders the incremental cost of acquiring and servicing a customer negligible. Effectively, the reach of financial services and consumer experience is going to improve drastically in the country.Vijay Shekhar Sharma is the founder of PaytmThis is part of a series of articles in Mints 10th anniversary special issue that look at India 10 years from now.

381,0.216025,"Mumbai: Union Budget 2017s proposals on electoral funding reforms have found favour generally, but the plan to issue so-called electoral bonds is seen as yet another attempt by the government to step on the turf of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
				   
				While all details on electoral bonds are not out yet, heres what is known: a person wishing to donate to a political party can purchase these bonds from an authorized bank using cheques or digital payment methods. These bonds shall be redeemable only in the designated account of a registered political party. To issue these bonds, the government will amend the RBI Act. On the face of it, these bonds look like bearer bonds. These are instruments which are not registered in the name of a specific owner and will pay to whoever bears them.Section 31 of the RBI Act gives power, as of today, to issue bearer bonds to RBI and government. The bearer bond has the characteristic of a currency. That is why the power is not given to a bank, said a senior RBI official on condition of anonymity.The RBI Act states that other than the central bank and central government, nobody can issue notes which have the characteristic of a banknote or a currency note. Hence, the government move to amend the Act to allow commercial banks to issue such bonds is leading to some discomfort among RBI officials who feel it will erode some of the central banks authority.The issue is especially sensitive coming at a time when two former governorsY.V. Reddy and Bimal Jalanhave expressed concern over RBIs eroding autonomy after the government rode roughshod over the central bank while demonetizing high-value currency notes.This will unnecessarily fragment the note-issuing authoritys capacity. The government can do without amending the Act, said a senior banker on condition of anonymity.Such bonds have nothing to do with RBIs authority or autonomy, said an expert in financial markets, but added that they are a bad idea nonetheless. RBI is a creature of RBI Act and if the government amends the Act, RBI will have to comply. I dont see the governments move to issue electoral bonds as infringing on RBIs autonomy, said Ajay Shah, professor, National Institute for Public Finance and Policy.A bearer bond assumes the character of cash. Then there is no difference if political parties are funded by cash or through electoral bonds. It doesnt improve the transparency of the funding process, said Shah.This is not the first time that the government has issued bearer bonds. In 1987, the then government floated a development bond called Indira Vikas Patra, which was issued through post offices. Since this had the characteristic of a bearer bond, it conferred anonymity to the holders of this bond. However, it was finally discontinued after it was suspected that these bonds were used as a conduit for laundering black money.",2017-02-03,r8DNSqB9GJ4BWVJh3WFR4N,"The plan to issue electoral bonds for political funding, as announced by Arun Jaitley in his budget speech, is seen as yet another attempt by govt to step on RBIs turf",01:57,Union Budget 2017s electoral bond proposal raises thorny questions for RBI
341,0.24855,"The most fundamental progress that technology has made over the past few decades is a dramatic increase in computing power coupled with a reduction in the cost of storage. Such progress has enabled us to run algorithms and code over swathes of data and at a fraction of the cost, thus yielding what some may consider more insights. Consequently, we are able to find patterns in large amounts of data. 
				   
				This, by some limited definition, is construed as intelligence and has been demonstrated in specific classes of activities such as detecting diabetes from retinal scans, driving cars, playing games, etc. In these cases, software can emulate human behaviour and perhaps even exceed human capabilities. But the fact is that we have not yet invented any new magic wand to make software think on its own or have any sense of consciousness, in the way humans do.The limitation is grounded in the fact that software still operates, for the most part, on the paradigm of Gigo (garbage in garbage out), meaning it mostly only does whatever we tell it to and is biased, based on whatever data we train it with. Give it incorrect data and it will pick up incorrect patterns.But the vision and aspiration of computer science has always been to build a machine that can accurately emulate human intelligence. However, we still have a long way to go before we can build a software system that is functionally capable the same way a human is. Software intelligence, though defined in academic circles, has been fairly misused (and misunderstood) in popular reporting, giving people the impression that software can do just about anything a human being can. This notion is fundamentally misguided. We are not there. Or at least not yet. The gap between software and the human mind is still massive.Consequently such gaps do not necessarily support claims that artificial intelligence (AI) and automation will replace hordes of jobs in the Indian IT industry and ultimately lead to mass unemployment. This industry employs provides direct employment for a few million people in India, a significant fraction of whom belong to our expanding middle class. Therefore, as various commentators have begun to call out the threat of automation to this industry there is considerable (and reasonable) fear whether the rise of machines spells doom and gloom for a section of the Indian middle class.But I do not believe we are there yet. Or at least not to the extent people fear. Automating away this labour force is not an easy task. Terms like robotic automation are not sufficient replacement for the complexity and range of tasks that this labour force performs. It is very tempting to prognosticate a future where silicon (computers) will rule supreme over carbon (humans). However, as a computer scientist, through my work and study over the past few years in the IT/technology industry and about how businesses consume technology, I have gained a genuine appreciation for the unique value and contributions human beings bring to the table in building trust and enabling businesses the world over. Automating these unique attributes with machines will necessarily require emulating the same value humans deliver in businesses.The role of professionals in the IT industry, the populace whose work is under threat from automation, has not yet been sufficiently understood nor has it been given its due credit. These professionals perform a range of activities, from understanding customers business requirements to writing code, maintaining software systems and processing transactions. Working in teams, they perform a variety of different actions touching several information systems, coordinate with each other, navigate uncertain or changing scenarios, report to their managers, take bottomline responsibilities for their respective systems, are accountable and serve customers across the globe. All these activities engender a deep sense of trust and confidence among their customers the world over.But this is also true for each individual. All humans, I argue, even in the most seemingly robotic tasks bring to bear abilities that do not make them merely robotic. Conceptually every human being has a brain stack comprised of layers that include the ability to execute deterministic tasks, intuition, experience, handling (unexpected) variations, common sense, and an ability to identify and fix the unusual. These are fundamental traits that all humans share, though, admittedly, some more than others. No matter the task each human has the potential and ability to apply these traits in any situation without necessarily being to do so a priori. It is a combination of these traits inherent to each one of us that engenders trust and confidence in us among our colleagues. All businesses run on such trust and confidence in their stakeholders  be they employees or vendors. Therefore, attempting to replace any human with a robotic system is akin to trying to hire a human being who can only ever execute deterministic tasks but lacks intuition, common sense, experience, and an ability to handle unusual situations!Hence, any attempt by intelligent software at automating all that work done by a single individual or an entire team of humans must involve recreating the same trust and confidence. This, in-turn, necessarily requires addressing the whole gamut of these activities that humans perform on a regular basis and with similar human traits, but in software.Therefore, the next stage of innovation in computer science will be not just to make software run faster but also about how to get software to emulate more human-like traits and ultimately become truly trustworthy (like humans).Rohan Murty is junior fellow at the Society of Fellows at Harvard University.This is part of a series of articles in Mints 10th anniversary special issue that look at India 10 years from now.

148,0.2484,"Mumbai: Foreign brokerages gave a thumbs up to the budget and were largely relieved that the government did not opt for a populist budget, and adopted a balanced approach.
				   
				In the run-up to the budget, the predominant view was that the government may present a populist budget with an eye on the elections in Uttar Pradesh and also try to soothe the people at large after the negative growth impact of demonetisation.Contrary to the consensus view, but in line with our view, the government has presented a popular, but not a populist, budget, Nomura said in a note.The message from the budget is that the government continues to prioritize macro stability over growth. We believe this is a very strong and positive signal, given it was under significant pressure to tilt towards populism, Nomura analysts added.In a note, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofA-ML) analysts said that the budget seems to have resisted the temptation of a short-term economically and politically expedient fiscal expansion, by limiting fiscal year 2018 deficit at 3.2% of GDP. HSBC economic Pranjul Bhandari also pointed that the government signed up for a slightly higher fiscal deficit than the pre-existing target on the expected lines, but with a promise to continue on the consolidation path. The assumptions underlying the revenue and expenditure estimates were broadly realistic, according to Bhandari.Goldman Sachs pointed that the government struck  a balance between fiscal prudence and growth boost, while pointing that the main concern for the budget was whether the government should boost growth in the near term, against the macro backdrop of the economic slowdown after the demonetisation, or stick to fiscal consolidation. There was some disappointment though, and a pullback from the recent relief rally was not ruled out.That the budget did not have any punitive tax measure (such as capital gains on equities) is a relief; but in itself the exercise is unlikely to lead to noticeable earnings upgrades, BofA-ML said in the note.BofA- ML analysts said that sectors such as staples and cement may benefit from the rural focus, while banks may benefit from the focus on digital and affordable housing. Yet, we see little reason to change our Dec 17 end Sensex fair value estimate of 29,000.

235,0.247725,"Sequoia, like Mint, completed 10 years in India recently. A decade is a long time. Long enough, perhaps, to look beyond the vagaries of short-term investment sentiment. In the last four years, there have been swings in expectations on how Indias technology story will unfold. 2014 and 2015 were characterized by much optimism, strong capital flows, exuberance in valuations and extravagance in company building. 2016 was a year in which companies strengthened their business foundations. But it was also a year of uncertainty and diminished expectations in the community.
				   
				Clouded by such recent history, we often under-appreciate the changes that have taken place over the last decade and underestimate ones which could pan out over the next one. Compare 2006 to 2016and you would realize that we have come a long way, both as an economy and as a tech ecosystem. A decade ago, Indian companies had a market perhaps half to one-thirtieth of the current one, depending on the sector. Venture capital was scarce and only those with inherited wealth were able to start businesses requiring capital. Even till 2010-11, when I founded a company, few people had Internet, even fewer had smartphones and there was no easy way of distributing technology to consumers. What a transformation a decade can unleash. Now, project the growth of the past decade on the next one and the market will be strikingly larger and more attractive for entrepreneurs starting businesses today. At Sequoia, we are excited about helping build technology companies which will serve this market across sectors. We are also hopeful that a few trends will pan out over the next decadeBusinesses will be built with better capital efficiencyIn recent times, Indian tech start-ups have taken significant capital to build  businesses. The biggest eight Indian private Internet companies have raised over $8 billion (around Rs55,000 crore) between them. We believe this will change going forward. Companies of the last decade found an ecosystem where they had to do much on their own. For e-commerce companies, this included their own warehousing, logistics and payments. There were no quality partners. Often, supply quality was poor, so marketplaces had to be full stack to provide a good customer experience. We also saw exceptional competitive intensity, fuelled in some cases by an oversupply of capital and in others by the entry of global players. This increased customer acquisition costs. The partner ecosystem is far better now, the base supply is improving and, as more differentiated business models emerge, competitive intensity and oversupply of capital is reducing. We are already seeing examples of thisVoonik, for instance, took far less capital than Myntra did to build a similar-sized fashion marketplace, thanks to a lighter operating model and outsourced logistics. With these, and the efficacy of engineering, product and sales teams going up with a maturing employee base, companies of the next decade should be more capital-efficient.Newer business models will emerge in existing categories Often entrepreneurs consider a category out of bounds for new businesses because of the presence of an incumbent. We think that a category is never taken and there is always scope for a new player to disrupt existing ones with a superior operating model. For instance, the C2C product commerce space has well-funded and large incumbents such as Quikr and Olx. But Zefo was still able to break into this market by providing a superior customer experience with a different operating model and instilling trust between the buyer and the seller. We expect more of this to happen in the coming decade.More and more sectors of the indian economy will be rebuilt by tech companies As a start-up ecosystem, we are playing in a canvas that covers a small fraction of Indias gross domestic product (GDP). Increasingly, we meet tech start-ups solving problems in sectors considered conventionally unattractive for venture investors. For instance, media, logistics and warehousing. Several sectors have incumbents which have done a poor job of customer service. Over time, most of them would become addressable to tech entrepreneurs and new companies will be built with a tech core, superior customer focus and stronger management. If you are an entrepreneur starting a business today, whats up for grabs is not just the digital market but the next decades $5 trillion Indian economy.With larger and more accessible markets, improving capital efficiency, more sectors of the economy becoming addressable and companies increasingly going after global markets, each year of tech investing in India looks incrementally better. At Sequoia, we wake up every morning excited about the future, and about partnering with entrepreneurs who will shape it.

301,0.247475,"At a time when companies are switching their business models to digital, cybersecurity has become a boardroom concern, for its implications now directly affect the balance sheet. However, its becoming increasingly difficult to objectively quantify a companys cyber risk considering the dynamic nature of an organizations perimeter, which in most cases cannot be distinctively defined thanks to BYOD (bring your own device), BYOA (bring your own access) and Dynamic DNS set-ups among others. The other component hindering quantification is the known unknown attack vectors. 
				   
				Reports estimate that the overall cost of cybercrime will touch $2 trillion (around Rs135 trillion) by 2019. Very recently in India, we saw 3.2 million debit cards being hacked; we have seen the largest bank in the worldJP Morgan Chasebeing hacked even though it spends $300 million on cybersecurity annually. We have seen companies headquartered in the Silicon Valley, built by the best tech minds from around the world, being hackedamong them Yahoo and Twitter. These examples clearly indicate that there is no such thing called 100% security. As in the physical world, the digital world also cannot be secured completely; it will be all about managing and mitigating risks.Cyberspace is continuously changing and evolving. In the future, companies will have to look at a three-dimensional approach of proactively protecting their digital stacks via technology and process-level controls, continuously monitor incidents and events and respond in the quickest and most efficient way possible in case there is an incident. Clear heat maps of data sets versus threat actors such as insiders, competitors, hacktivists, state-sponsored hackers, terrorists, script kiddies and organized criminals will be mapped specific to the industry and the company to prioritize security efforts. At the government level, recognizing the strategic dimensions of cyberspace, the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) created the position of  national cyber security coordinator in 2014, which is a great move. I feel Reserve Bank of India initiatives such as ReBIT (Reserve Bank Information Technology Pvt. Ltd) will enable the much required streamlining of financial services, IT and information security from a regulatory compliance standpoint. The recent push to have an independent payments regulator highlighted in the recent budget by the finance minister is another positive step in this direction.The future of hacking from a techies lens looks very, very exciting. We have already seen an explosion of on-demand hacking services like Haas (hacking as a service), and this will only expand in the future. From script kiddies to a bustling underground marketplace of tailor-made targeted DIY (do-it-yourself) exploits that have 24x7 support, along with the release of continuously enhanced and more sophisticated versions of a malwareits all now just a few clicks and a few hundred dollars away. With other hack enablers such as bot nets readily available to be purchased by the hour, the possibilities of a normal tech enthusiast executing a successful hack go up exponentially.With faster and cheaper computing power readily available, we will see the rise of more complex crypto algorithms with longer key values. This isnt all good news, for complex crypto is always a double-edged swordon the one hand, it does make it hard for a hacker to decipher the data both in motion and at rest; on the other, it becomes extremely difficult to decrypt system files affected by ransomware or doxware.We have been hearing about the shift from a signature-based analysis system to a behaviour and context-based system for quite some time now, but thanks to machine learning and artificial intelligence, I feel we will be able to take tangible steps towards this very soon. AI (artificial intelligence) and ML (machine learning) will also play an extremely important role in real-time learning about individuals from available data over the Internet to create a mind map (which will get more accurate as the data set increases) of an individual you might meet for the first timetaking the entire privacy debate to an absolutely new level. Not to forget the possible implication of an artificial intelligence attack on the Internetsomething thats only a matter of time, in the words of SpaceXs Elon Musk.There will be a clear shift to objective and quantized cyber risk management techniques that will incorporate the known unknowns to make cyber risk an informed business decision. The attack surface will not be restricted to internal IT but will extend to third parties, cloud providers and social media, among others. The focus in the future will not only be on security products but on building secure products from the ground up.The way we are adopting digital, with a clear push coming from the top in both private and public set-ups, technology is going to take centre stage in the success of most new initiatives. And while this happens, the key for the industry will be to learn from cyber attacks and embed the learnings into our defence systems as quickly as possible.

284,0.2413,"Mumbai: Aster DM Healthcare Ltd, which runs hospitals in India, the Philippines, and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, is likely to defer its proposed initial public offering (IPO) because of concerns over valuation of its overseas operations from which the company derives a large part of its revenues, two people aware of the development said on condition of anonymity. 
				   
				Aster DM had filed for an IPO in June last year and had received approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in November. According to the people cited above, the company was looking to raise close to $300 million from the IPO, valuing the company at around $2.5 billion. The IPO was planned for early this year, before the end of the March quarter.The key reason for the delay in the IPO is the current market condition of its overseas business, especially in Saudi Arabia, which has been badly hit by the fall of oil prices, said one of the two people. As a result, the company has decided that going ahead with the IPO will adversely impact its valuation. It has asked bankers involved in the IPO process to go slow till further notice, the person added.Responding to an email query, a spokesperson of Aster DM said, There is no change in IPO plans and we will look to launch the IPO at an appropriate time, subject to market and business considerations. The company did not disclose any timeline for the proposed IPO. In contrast, mattress maker Sheela Foam Ltd, which received Sebi approval for its IPO around the same time as Aster DM, listed successfully in December, raising around Rs510 crore.In its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP), Aster DM disclosed that its overseas revenues might be impacted due to fall in oil prices globally. The company said that in Saudi Arabia, where a substantial portion of its revenues are derived from patients referred and funded by the ministry of health, a decline in oil prices and the overall economic conditions have had a direct impact, resulting in an increase in receivables from the ministry of health. In order to counter this, the company said it was exploring other business opportunities in Saudi Arabia, including increasing its share of private insurance and walk-in patients. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully secure alternative sources of revenue in Saudi Arabia, or at all, the company disclosed in the draft prospectus.Aster DM has a diversified portfolio of healthcare facilities, consisting of six hospitals, 83 clinics and 180 retail pharmacies in the Gulf Cooperation Council states, seven multi-speciality hospitals and three clinics in India, and one clinic in the Philippines as of 31 March 2016. Asters hospitals in India are located in Kochi, Kolhapur, Kozhikode, Kottakkal, Bengaluru and Hyderabad and are operated under the Aster, MIMS or Prime brands. Its clinics in India are located at Kozhikode and Bengaluru.Aster DMs operations in India, which primarily consist of hospitals, accounted for only 12.52% of the companys total revenues in the nine months ending 31 December 2015, according to the draft prospectus. For the financial year 2014-15, GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries contributed Rs3,447.8 crore to revenue, compared with a contribution of Rs427.9 crore by the Indian operations. The company has received investments from PE funds Olympus Capital Asia Investments Ltd and True North (previously known as India Value Fund Advisors). Both PE funds were expected to dilute a part of their stake along with the promoters in the IPO.Since December 2016, four healthcare services firms have tapped the primary markets to fund their expansion plans and provide an exit to their PE investors. Collectively, these firmsDr Lal Pathlabs Ltd, Narayana Hrudayalaya Ltd, HealthCare Global Enterprises Ltd and Thyrocare Technologies Ltdhave raised almost Rs2,375 crore. In December, a Mint report citing Investec, a global specialist banking group, said that Indias healthcare sector will see investors looking to exit close to $3 billion of primary investments in the next two-three years through secondary sales and public market listings.",2017-02-03,bOEhXYcgzr8pWHdBOVb78K,"Aster DM Healthcare was looking to raise close to $300 million from the IPO, valuing the company at around $2.5 billion ",00:50,Aster DM defers IPO plans over valuation concerns of overseas operations 
306,0.249525,"Bengaluru: Bhaskar Bhat, 62, has been at the helm of Tata group firm Titan Co. Ltd for nearly 15 years. His association with the Tata Watch Project, which eventually led to the creation of Titan, has continued for more than three decades, during which he has seen the Titan brand expand from watches into jewellery, eyewear and precision engineering.
				   
				About four months ago, Titan entered yet another categorytraditional womens wearas part of a pilot project, while watches and jewellery continue to be its mainstay, accounting for a major portion of its revenue. Unlike the jewellers in the unorganized sector who have been hit by demonetization, Titan expects the governments move to help boost its sales in the longer run. The company estimates it has less than 5% market share in jewellery and therefore abundant headroom for growth.As of now there are no acquisition plans in the pipeline, says Bhat, and the companys focus is on integrating brands such as CaratLane in jewellery and Favre-Leuba in watches and Maison Montblancwhich makes jewellery, writing instruments and leather goodsas all these were acquired less than two years ago. In an interview, Bhat spoke about the companys key business segments and the fillip it expects from demonetization. Edited excerpts:How has this fiscal year shaped up so far and what kind of growth rate do you expect over the next two years?Overall, like we reported, we had been growing in the first six months, by a small amount, but still, growth was there. In fact, we even said that were expecting a 15% growth in the jewellery business and we expect to clock those numbers. In watches also, the growth rates are better than last year. So the year as such is better, that much I can say. We will be able to keep our current rate of growth, i.e. 15%. Whether it will be much more for FY18 and the year after, we cannot say. But for us FY18 will be better than the current year primarily because demonetization has, in a way, sucked the winds out of the sails of the unorganized sector. Do you expect any fallout from demonetization on Titans future performance? Right now I can confidently say that the concerns because of demonetizationfor instance, concerns that there is no cash for daily transactions so I wont buy watcheshas diminished considerably. It was an event that has affected most companies and we have also articulated that we did get affected in the first week to 10 days. After that, normalcy has come back; the informal (unorganized) economy was affected whereas it has not affected us. In the end, consumers have to buy jewellery, watches and eyewear. If the unorganized sector is not able to give them the product, theyll have to come to us, right?Companies that were doing business in black will not be able to transform to our kind of model or any other kind of model where you accept credit cards and cheques, you keep your books of accounts and you pay taxes. Thats not a transition which will occur easily. And that is where the demand which is there, fundamentally, will flow to companies that can and have been operating legitimately.Youve said in the past that the jewellery industry will be full of turmoil due to policy changes. Is that still your expectation, in particular for this year? Over the past two years, there has been considerable turmoil in the jewellery industry. Gold-on-lease was stopped and later restored, customs duty was increased from 6% to 10%. Then excise duty was introduced and, if you remember, stores were closed for 43 days. Disclosing PAN cards was introduced for purchases above Rs5 lakh and then further dropped to those over Rs 2 lakh. And then we had demonetization. But I think jewellers have now learnt a lesson. At what rate the government decides to impose GST (goods and services tax) is the only other policy change in store and that will benefit us because a lot of the jewellers will have to fall in linedemonetization plus GST is a nightmare for them. So we should benefit from FY18 onward.Which of your jewellery brands are you betting big on and do you expect sales from your Golden Harvest Scheme (GHS) to get a significant boost going ahead?There is a lot of excitement in CaratLane, which we acquired, and Mia. Both are appealing to younger consumers. But between Tanishq, Mia, Zoya, CaratLaneTanishq is certainly the biggest brand. It is a very steady high-growth brand and is at a very high level of sales. Sales from GHS are basically advance booking orders; so youve got a guarantee that one year later at least this much business you will do. Its always been 15-20% of our sales. We aggressively push GHS. Maybe its contribution to sales can increase a little more but I dont see it becoming the new normal.Watches and eyewear have not been doing too well. Whats the plan to boost sales? Watches are bought today as an accessory, not as a time-keeping device. So the strategy is clearly accessorization and premiumization. Getting into the smartwatch segment is also a strategy that weve introduced and were doing well at it. Eyewear has been slow this year, yes. Right now the effort is in ensuring existing stores grow rather than new stores. Growth will come out of the so-called same-store sales growth mantra. Is Titan planning to enter any new categories? We began piloting traditional womens wear in October and are looking at opening a physical store. And we still have to grow perfumes, for example, which is still at a level of Rs30-40 crore. So we dont have any other category in the pipeline. What is your strategy when it comes to competing with online marketplaces? We participate, we dont compete. In watches, we are with online marketplaces like Flipkart and Myntra, and we have a strict contractual obligation with them as to what price they can sell our products at. Discounting is at our behest, not theirs and they have agreed to this so theyve become a partner. The biggest advantage we have is we have offline stores. Our strategy has always been omnichannel but there are very big advantages of bricks and mortar, which I think bricks-and-mortar companies need to play up and not just assume that everybody is going to migrate to online. The need to go to a store is least in watches, because watches you can buy online also, and highest in jewellery. The higher the ticket size, the more risk-averse people will get. So convenience is not everything when you are buying. And I think this trend of buying eyewear online is a passing phase. People will realize that unless you get the quality that you want, it can be quite bad. If your lens is not good enough, for example, its a risk. You also cant touch and feel your frame (before placing an order online). Youve been associated with Titan, and earlier the Tata Watch Project for about three decades. What would you say is the one significant event in the history of the company? We didnt know a thing about retail. So the first retail store we opened in Safina Plaza (a shopping complex in central Bengaluru) in the late 1980s was very memorable. It was a 350-square-foot store but it was very well designed. I remember we sold 17 watches on the first day and we were very thrilled! That was a significant event in the life of Titanthe introduction of retailing.When you look back, I dont think we ever dreamt that we would be a watches, and jewellery, and eyewear, and precision engineering company. It was inconceivable. We were just about relieved that wed got government approval to get into the watch industry and that we were able to make good watches and overtake HMT in five-six years. After that, its been kind of a dream run.",2017-02-04,eokVM94g0SpP1h72Lt1VFO,Titan MD Bhaskar Bhat on integrating brands such as CaratLane  and why he expects the jewellery business to get a boost from demonetisation,00:41,"Titan will maintain current growth rate over two years, says Bhaskar Bhat"
