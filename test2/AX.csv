-0.48,"Two sets of findings, related to societal trust levels, in a report released last week at the World Economic Forums annual meeting in Davos, should be a cause of grave concern to all of us. Part of a study released by communications group Edelman, the survey of more than 33,000 people in 28 countries including India, recorded the largest-ever drop of trust in business, government, the media, and non-government organisations (NGOs).
				   
				Corporate chief executive officers (CEOs), whose credibility level dropped in each of the countries surveyed, were aggressively targeted with only 37% of people saying they trusted them.The 12-point drop from the previous year is the all-time low since the survey began in 2001. This isnt the first time the corporate sector has been reminded of declining peoples trust. Last January, Young & Rubicam BrandAsset Valuator revealed that consumers trust in well-known brands continues to fall.ALSO READ | What global CEOs are watching for, according to a PwC surveyStrangely, you would think that CEOs reputation for trust would have taken a hit from the work of the media. But that institution didnt fare too well either with 43% of the respondents expressing trust in the press, down from 48% the year before. So if peoples falling trust in company executives isnt driven by the reports in traditional media, where is the angst coming from? Perhaps theres a third force now that might be responsible for generating the ire and thats the social media, the new watchdog for corporate wrongdoing.Edelman CEO Richard Edelman, speaking at the WE, linked this to the sky-high compensation levels of top CEOs as well as the fact that employees were disappointed their leaders were not helping them deal with automation and the changing business environment. These changes have led to a rash of lay-offs in recent times with companies as diverse as Oracle Corp., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Microsoft Corp. trimming their work forces.ALSO READ | Of founders and CEOsIn India, close on the heels of the controversy last year when several well-funded start-ups rolled back offers made to fresh graduates from engineering schools, comes the news this year of large scale sackings. Just this week, Girnar Software Pvt. Ltd, which runs a series of auto portals including CarDekho and is funded by such heavyweights as CapitalG (formerly Google Capital), Sequoia Capital, Hillhouse Capital and Ratan Tata, announced that it was axing 136 people.Paradoxically, for all the efforts CEOs and top leaders make to build their image, it is the companys rank and file that is viewed by the public as more trustworthy.Indeed, twice as many respondents would have employees rather than CEOs communicate financial earnings and operational performance.Why is trust important? Business analysts have frequently proved that there is a direct correlation between growth and trust.ALSO READ | Optimism reigns in India as CEOs, consumers look beyond ChinaAmerican behavioural economist and psychiatrist Richard L. Peterson and sports consultant Frank Murtha noted in 2008 after the financial crisis: Trust is the oil in the engine of capitalism, without it, the engine seizes up. Confidence is like the gasoline, without it the machine wont move.Part of the reason for the increasing trust deficit is of course the overall culture of lower deference towards authority figures and institutions. But that isnt all of it. In 2016, for instance, Volkswagen AG CEO Martin Winterkorns resigned following the emissions scandal, Fox News CEO Roger Ailes lost his job following a sexual harassment charge, Mylan CEO Heather Bresch became a public enemy when she trebled prices of life-saving injection EpiPen, and Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf came under fire for refusing to take personal responsibility when his bank was caught creating two million fake accounts. Closer home, Vijay Mallya took employees, shareholders and bankers for a right royal ride before flying to the UK as creditors closed in on him.The resulting trust deficit has had several disastrous consequences. Corporate loyalty is fast going the way of the dinosaur. As employees feel free to change jobs at will, this has led to mounting costs of hiring and training besides a struggle to build team spirit and group dynamics. Externally, there is a lower threshold level of tolerance for any slippage in corporate performance. One quarter of declining numbers and stakeholders start demanding changes either in terms of management or worse still, strategy.Corporate trust deficit is a two-way street. It indicates that employees, customers, and company watchers have problems believing what its top executives say. But equally it also indicates that the company itself is in some kind of trouble.Sundeep Khanna is a consulting editor at Mint and oversees the newsrooms corporate coverage.

0.02,"Pune: The 57-year-old boss of Tech Mahindra, C.P. Gurnani, says that Indian technology outsourcing companies have always transformed themselves in the past and that it will be wrong to write off the countrys $150-billion outsourcing industry even as new technologies disrupt the landscape. In an interview in Pune last week, Gurnani shared the bets Tech Mahindra is making and why he remains confident that the company will be able to remain relevant even as technology fundamentally changes the way companies across industries do business. Edited excerpts:
Analysts and commentators have started penning obituaries for the Indian IT outsourcing industry. From your perch, what is the future of Indian IT and Tech Mahindra? It will be wrong to write us off. I see the present as exciting times. Remember, Indian IT has seen changes all throughout its life. It all started with Father Kohli (F.C. Kohli, the first CEO of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd). The model then was that companies said, we have consultants and we will give them to you. Then the Y2K moment happened, which was like an inflection point.  In all these decades, the industry has grown. So, even now, the focus for Tech Mahindra, and I believe other Indian heritage IT firms, is that you need to make sure we remain relevant. Technology is changing industries around us. My priority No. 1 (is) to make ourselves remain relevant.ALSO READ | Tech Mahindra bets on DAVID strategy to fuel growthSo, how are you making Tech Mahindra stay relevant? Can you also share what are, say, the three big bets for Tech Mahindra? I can tell you not three but five. First is cybersecurity. Second is imaging as a service or say, a service where we use automation platform with radiologist, and run imaging as a service. No. 3 is blockchain. No. 4 is that we want to be the largest system integrator in the Internet of things (IoT). No. 5 is network services, as the world moves towards last-mile connectivity, and focus on software-defined networks (increases).All IT firms are talking about these newer tech. When can we see Tech Mahindra beginning to disclose the business it generates from each of these five big bets?We should be able to do this soon. The way we look at it is that we will take 12-16 months to incubate them. So, out of the five, three will go into production phase. It is possible that not all five will go into production phase. And so, I believe that the three which go into production, it is my duty to report the numbers. I have invested shareholder money and I guess it is the right of the shareholders to know what I have done with their money. So, we should be able to report the revenue or business once it goes into production (phase) after 12-16 months.How different will the Tech Mahindra of 2020 be? Currently, 65% of my business comes from IT while balance comes from engineering services, network services, customer experience, platform and security. Im taking a forward call and saying 50% will come from IT and 50% will come from different platforms by 2020. So, obviously there will be changes.Your thoughts on the internal goal of becoming a $10 billion firm by 2020, and what percentage of revenue will be called digital by then? Will it be more than half of your revenue, as against the 15-7% currently? Will it mean significant revenue from M&A?I cannot comment on the Internal  goals. But on your question of digital revenue, I would say that the way market is moving, getting more than 50% you see is not relevant. Because if I get the topline, I promise you, we will have more than 50% (coming from) digital.One of the things which is often held against Indian heritage IT firms is that they are too conservative. You are talking about blockchain. But if you are serious, then why not launch a service line? Take a more aggressive approach like the one adopted by IBM, which has set up business focused on blockchain technologies.I cannot comment on what approach other companies are taking. Im not betting my company on any one technology. If you look at my company, 65% of business which comes from traditional IT will change to 50% by 2020. So, I will still get 50% from IT. So, Im not betting my whole ranch on this. blockchain for all you know will be $200 million practice, say, for us when Im $8 billion or $9 billion. So, are you saying that there is enough in traditional business?I am not saying this. All I am saying is that my companys focus remains and will be in solving business problems. I will choose the technology. Im not getting married to one technology. And that is the difference between service and product companies. Tech Mahindra is perceived to be lagging behind in digital technologies. It does not have a strong consultancy arm, for instance. You are wrong when you say I dont have a strong consultancy arm. I have about 3,000 consultants. I have probably what is the largest IT telecom services firm out of India being a leader for the last 10 years and I will be the leader for the next 10 years. From the positioning point of view, I have taken a position:  I will be largest IT  firm in the media, communication and entertainment industry. We have launched DAVID, and the core reason to launch this is to make ourselves future-ready.",2016-12-21,05PcYpZOmBeSeBLoMPqETN,Tech Mahindra CEO CP Gurnani on bets his firm is making and why he remains confident that it will remain relevant in the face of disruptive technology,competitor,03:19,"By 2020, 50% of Tech Mahindras business will come from IT: CEO CP Gurnani "
-0.23,"New Delhi: Private sector lender ICICI Bank on Thursday announced a cut in home loan rate by 0.15% for new borrowers, joining the rate cut initiated by bigger rival SBI. 
				   
				Home loans up to Rs75 lakh for women borrowers will now attract an interest of 9.15% from the earlier rate of 9.30%, according to the ICICI Bank website. At the same time, the new rate for salaried class has been reduced to 9.20%, as against 9.35% earlier. The new rate is effective from 2 November, a day after the bank lowered marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) by 0.1%.Yesterday, SBI had slashed interest rates by 0.15% for its home loans up to Rs75 lakh. SBI home loan is available at 9.15% while women borrowers will get it at 9.10% interest. According to analysts, the rate reduction effected by large players would put pressure on others to follow suit to remain in the competition. Since there is hardly any credit demand from corporate sector, most of the banks are chasing retail loans to keep their balance sheet ticking, analysts added.Yesterday, ICICI Bank launched a product for the salary account holders who have taken a loan from it, offering credit from Rs5 lakh to Rs1 crore against property owned by them.The product, ICICI Bank Home Overdraft, offers dual advantage of a term loan as well as an overdraft facility, the bank said in a statement.While the term loan provides customers with quick funds for immediate needs, the overdraft facility offers them the flexibility to access funds instantly for expenses, as and when required, the bank had said.Those buying the overdraft loan from the bank would be able to utilise the funds for their personal needs such as education, medical treatment, home renovation, marriage and overseas travel, among others.Customers will have the facility to avail a minimum 10% of the total amount as term loan and maximum 90% as overdraft.ICICI Bank said that the interest on term loan would be charged as per the equated monthly instalment, while on the overdraft the charges will be only on the utilised amount for the period the funds are used.",2016-11-03,05T7DNd3rw7HQKWVOFYoOP,"The new home loan rate is effective from 2 November, a day after ICICI Bank lowered marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) by 0.1%",competitor,15:43,ICICI Bank slashes home loan rate by 0.15%
0.17,"Global steel production rose by 1.9% from a year ago in August, up from the 1.5% growth seen in July, according to the World Steel Association (Worldsteel). China is the main reason why steel output has risen by this much, but global output ex-China too has risen in the past few months. Still, China dominates the steel discussion; in August, for instance, its output rose by 3% versus 0.9% for the rest of the world.
				   
				The rise in output may seem problematic, for Worldsteel had predicted in April that the global demand for steel would decline by 0.8% with Chinas demand declining by 4%. That appears to have changed, especially as China has taken steps to stimulate economic growth. ArcelorMittal said, in its June quarter results statement, that it expects global steel consumption to grow slightly in 2016, without giving a number. It said Chinese steel demand will benefit from growth in the infrastructure and automotive sectors, although real estate has lost momentum.Not just China, India too is contributing to global output growth. The ramp-up of new capacity at its major steel plants has seen its crude steel output increase by 9.4% in August. Sadly, its domestic demand is unable to absorb this level of steel output, as demand for finished steel increased by only 1% in August, according to data from the Joint Plant Committee. In the April-August period, it rose by only 1.3%.Thus, producers have been forced to export finished steel, although domestic sales fetch higher realizations. Exports of finished steel in April-August were up by 23.6%, with August alone seeing an increase of 87.3%. On the positive side, the governments steps to prevent the dumping of steel have benefited local steel producers on the pricing front.Globally, as in India, the main worry is when demand will recover to healthier levels to support this increase in output. Else, it will eventually lead to excess steel on the market that will spill into the global market and upset prices. While everyone appears to look to China to rein in its steel output, it has not shown much sign of relenting so far, although it has been promising to do so.In a move towards consolidation, this week came news that Baoshan Iron and Steel  (part of the Baosteel Group) will acquire Wuhan Iron and Steel, combining to create 60 million tonnes of steel capacity, according to Reuters. If this form of consolidation leads to more discipline on the production front, that is good for the world but if it leads to lower costs for the group while output grows unhindered, then it is of little use for the global steel industry.",2016-09-22,0A79xlrcIAFkQLkItzRBDP,"The rise in output may seem problematic, for Worldsteel had predicted in April that the global demand for steel would decline by 0.8% with Chinas demand declining by 4%",competitor,23:38,Steel output goes up and away
0.57,"At Mints 10th Annual Banking Conclave on 23 January, Indias top bankers got together to discuss issues confronting the sector such as competition, growth and asset quality. SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya, ICICI managing director (MD) and chief executive officer (CEO) Chanda Kochhar, Punjab National Bank MD and CEO Usha Ananthasubramanian, HDFC Bank MD Aditya Puri, Axis Bank MD and CEO Shikha Sharma, and Citibank India CEO Pramit Jhaveri took part in the discussion on Indian Banking: The new landscape moderated by Tamal Bandyopadhyay. Edited excerpts: 
On increasing competition and the changing banking landscape, with the emergence of differentiated banks:Puri: Competition will come, there will be a change in the financial landscape...congruence of information, technology, mobility, analytics and computing (means) that there will be a change in the business model. All of us are pretty much prepared today to offer every conceivable financial service to the customer in any form he wants. He wants it manually, he wants it on the phone, computerhe can have a complete set of services which include what wallets would do, what payment banks would do. If he comes to our bank say on our mobile phone, he can buy mutual funds, buy insurance, he can download an app like a wallet... he can get his assets report. We are pretty much ahead of the curve. We are not complacent.On foreign banks in India: Jhaveri: If you look back in time in the last 25 years, this industry has been no stranger to competition, this industry has been no stranger to disruption. In the last two decades, we have seen this happen multiple times; this industry is not afraid of competition... Since the financial crisis, the global industry has undergone significant changesome of it is because of the crisis, the new regulatory regime. As far as we are concerned there are natural advantages which we bring to the tablethere is a global footprint, global reach... If you combine that with our strength in India from the technology point of view, disruption point of view, we are very pleased with what we were able to do both on the corporate and consumer side. If you look at the number of milestones which have taken place... things have only got better over time. On the limited growth of foreign banks in India:Jhaveri: At the end of the day, you have to look at the presence you can have in a particular market place around the constraints we operate. At the end of the day, we have a limited branch footprint. When you look at innovations, plenty of which we have had on the consumer side, institution side, I will not bore you with that. You look at the market share (of foreign banks) with a very small physical footprint in the countrythe credit card business, wealth management business; I will not bore you with numbers. Our market share is significant...On the emerging competitive scenario:Ananthasubramanian: If you see Indian banking, every public sector bank remained a regional bank. Post-liberalization, with branch expansion, competition started. It will continue to be on, irrespective of the players coming in... Given the competition, I will say if you lay a cake on this table and everybody takes a piece, the cake will continue to grow. That is the scope of banking. But Indian banks have realized that you have to be on your toes and take competition through the route of technology. The established banks in the country can take on competition and still remain in harmony.Sharma: We will see new forms of competition coming. We have also invested a lot in terms of technology through a range of products to our customers and making sure we are able to differentiate in terms of service. We are pretty well prepared and any functionality customer is looking for, we have a digital footprint around that. We will not be embarrassed. We are excited by some of the competition. In India, today there is still a huge market out there...Jayakumar: Most significant challenge which we face is to complete the transformation exercise. One is to strengthen our basic processes, second is to get digital, analytical, etc., third is significant of people. That is a significant objective at this point of time. That said, we have a bunch of young people who are pushing forward, my perspective of the whole thing is get ourselves fit, get these changes done.Kochhar: I dont think many of us will be able to say different things because already a lot has been spoken. The Indian banking industry has always faced competition because we have certain areas of business that we are following; sometimes it is interest rates and currently technology is disruptive again. New entrants are coming in the field. A lot of changes are happening across...the financial spectrum. A lot of what these small entities can do, banks can also do; banks have a larger relationship with the customers. Second is, competition expands the market, it brings more and more people to the formal lending market.Bhattacharya: We have been alive for the past 111 years... We have in fact used competition at every level to sort of lift up, and in the last 10 years actually in deposits we have gained 300 basis points market share, from 15.3% we are up to 18.3% and in advances we have gained 60 basis points. We have a customer base of 350 million and on a daily basis we were opening 50,000-70,000 accounts...after demonetisation, we alone opened 89 lakh accounts, thats  the kind of the reach we have. Demonetisation gave us a boost in ensuring our BC (business correspondent) channels were really active, we have a huge amount of collaboration. We have 235,00 PoS (point of sales) machines which are paying out cash; competition makes us tougher, wiser and better.On how easy or difficult is it to change public sector banks:Jayakumar: One is to look at a parallel transformational exercise SBI has done. I have spoken to their CEOs, past and present. As far as changes are concerned, there will be some resistance; once plans start showing results, resistance starts coming off... I think it has lot to do with the way we communicate, but accept that there will be some pushback and you have to pick the right battles. On impact of demonetisation on monetary transmission:Bhattacharya: In Indian banks, 97% of resources come from deposits. Therefore, if you are not cutting rates of deposit, you will not be able to pass on that benefit (of lower rates). You cut rates of deposits when they are plentiful in the system. It is a simple law of demand and supply. All the banks are saying that if RBI (Reserve Bank of India) cuts rates and keeps liquidity tight, there is no way transmission can occur. Till March this year, liquidity was very very tight. However, because of the huge deposits that have come into the system, we are able to reduce the cost of deposits and automatically that will flow into cost of borrowing. A lot of us are held back, we are not sure how much of those resources will stay with us. If these resources prove to be stable, which we will get to know in the next 2-3 months, you will see deposit rates further falling... you will see impact on borrower side. On deposits, we are quite conservative; on loan side not so. The reason is that is we want to give a fillip to credit growth, with so much of deposits hanging on our hands if I dont give a fillip to credit growth I will not be able to make the best of the situation. On deposits side we are still being conservative.Puri: At the moment we have a tremendous amount of supply. If money is tight and we are not dependent on our borrowers funds, then unless the supply of money exceeds demand, rates will not come down... Sharma: For a quarter I will expect rates to remain low depending on when restrictions on withdrawls are removed. We will go quarter by quarter.Ananthasubramanian: This is a kind of one-off event that has happened in the countrys history. This kind of accretion we have never seen. Bank deposits have surged... Maybe, I am guessing, 40% will stay with us...For a short while, it will be an advantage that will flow to the customers.Kochhar: We should recognize this was a one of its kind event. Even in the first six months of the year, total accretion to the banking system was Rs5.4 trillion but just in these two months, accretion was another Rs6 trillion. In that sense liquidity has come into the banking system and therefore reduces the lending rate. Some part of it will go back to the system, and some should go back to the system. Impact on interest rates is (that) we will definitely remain in a soft interest rate regime.Ananthasubramanian: In the post-demonetisation era, what has happened is, specially women I speak of, that money has moved from masala dabbas to the banking sector. People have opened accounts, money has moved into the system, that is one. It is very important to educate (customers) and plan strategy with them, which is happening. People are being educated about various services like SIPs (systematic investment plans)...Jhaveri: When you look at credit offtake and investment, we tend to focus just on the private sector. When you look at different offtakes, we talked about consumers, households. I think there is no problem with credit offtake. As far as private corporate sector is concerned, working capital needs to increase, there are certain clear indications that working capital cycle is increasing. Hopefully, that will be followed over time as some will start increasing capacity utilization. It has been a tough period in terms of credit offtake...Kochhar: When you look at credit growth, lets also look at two things in terms of how the Indian economy is structurally changing. One is supply of credit itself, if you look at the last one year, there was a Rs4 trillion increase in the banking credit; there is an equal amount of issuance of bonds and commercial paperwe tend to ignore that. Second is that structure of economy is also changing...Its not just about working capital increase of a particular company, how it is translating into a lot of start-ups that are then increasing multiplier impact on the economy...Sharma: On retail side, as everybody has said, growth has been reasonably heavy, and some products are more interest rate-sensitivefor instance mortgages, very interest rate-sensitive. The fact that interest rates have come off, helps the mortgage market; may be right now people are waiting (in the hope) that home prices will correct next quarter or so; home loans should see annual growth from here, auto loans and retail loans have done well... We expect working capital growth to pick up. As far as private investment is concerned, we need to wait for the consumption cycle to play out. Credit growth of double digits is a good number. Bhattacharya: Investments happen when your existing capacity starts getting utilized to around 80-85%. Now for that to happen, demand has to go up. At this point of time, two things will make demand go up. Because demand in this country exists, its a question of people actually executing on that demand. One is business confidence goes up and two ease of doing business goes up. Both of these two are very important. Government has in its hands one very potent trigger that can actually be used for doing both the things, that is the budget. In the budget, it has been our recommendationboosting both consumption and investment. Now if this is done in proper manner I do believe it can act as a very good trigger. This along with resolution of large stressed assets on which we are working on very, very assiduously. These two things can actually bring back the demand.On pain caused to the informal economy by demonetisation, impact on demand:Puri: I think in most of the organized sector and sectors that moved from the unorganized to the organized sector, it (demand) has pretty much returned. I talked to Bharat Puri at Pidilite, he is seeing a return to whatever was there on 8 November; I talked to Harsh Mariwala (Marico Ltd chairman), he is also surprised with the V recovery; then I see for ourselves, we are back to 8 November.Sharma: I think what Aditya said is that in the formal sector or which has moved to the formal sector, recovery has surprised all by being V-shaped but the segments which are cash segment parts of agriculture, there I think the recovery is slower.Puri: The second part is that the parts of the economy that are moving from informal to formal sector also will create demand for assets. What you were financing previously though cash will now have to be financed with the banks.On banks asset quality. Is the worst over?Bhattacharya: One must understand somethingthat non-performing assets (NPAs) are not a one-time occurrence. NPAs are an occurrence that happen throughout the life of any institution, not only for banks, even for businesses. Even businesses have to write off some amount of receivables. What happened in this case was that a large number of units, especially in infrastructure, went bad because investments happened in one short and small space of time and many of the investments could not result in the ultimate assets getting created and cash flows getting established. This happened on account of many, many things that happened in the economy in a particular space of time. Having said that, I must say that whatever the government has done for enabling better resolution is going to have its effect, it may not have yet started...Yes, the worst is over...These are evolving times. Impact of demonetisation on SMEs (small and medium enterprises), that will come with a lag of about a quarter. It takes time to trickle down into the banks book. By March 2017, we should look at things getting better.Kochhar: When we talk of NPAs we generally just get stuck with recognition and numbers. Important point is recognition, resolution and provision. Now, if you look at banks in India, recognition-wise there are RBI rules, not just that. RBI followed earlier recognition through the AQR (asset quality review), we have also been doing that. As far as provisions are concerned, some banks have been proactive to actually provide more to the extent possible. On recognition and provisioning, a lot of work has happened.What is very important is that...we give equal amount of focus on resolution...Jayakumar: I am not focused on gross NPA ratio and that number for us has been coming down. Second, there are risks in the mid-market segment. Three, one hopes some of the larger accounts get resolved; that will provide us with some upgrades that will pay for the litigation. Overall I think we will be within the forecast that is provided.",2017-01-30,0Ab1voUw7w35LqJc80J1pL,"At Mints 10th Annual Banking Conclave, Indias top bankers discuss issues confronting the sector such as competition, growth and asset quality",both,02:58,Mint Annual Banking Conclave | The changing landscape of Indian banking
0.46,"The Indian banking system is quickly going digital, but in the rush to adopt technology and usher in a cashless society, is the system overlooking key opportunities and challenges? This was a topic of discussion at the 10th Mint Annual Banking Conclave, which was held in Mumbai on 23 January.
				   
				The panel discussing the issue included V. Vaidyanathan, founder and executive chairman, Capital First Ltd; Anup Purohit, chief information officer, Yes Bank Ltd; Naresh Makhijani, partner and head-financial services, KPMG; Vijay Mukhi, cybersecurity expert; and Venkatesh Hariharan, director (fintech), ISPIRT.According to Vaidyanathan, the Indian banking system is currently going through one of its toughest changes. With the current change coming in, a number of existing players could find themselves flat-footed and a number of new players such as payments banks, mobile wallet companies could be coming in. To innovate, this one is going to be a more difficult churn, he said.Purohit, the only banker on the panel, claimed Yes Bank had managed to improve digital payment options for its customers by taking the whole payments infrastructure outside the banks internal systems.We focused on API (application programming interface) banking where we said that our customers will not use Yes Bank systems. Our customers will directly use it on their own systems as we have implemented our API on their corporate ERP (enterprise resource planning), Purohit said.Hariharanwhose iSPIRT, a think tank that also produces digital solutions for the Indian banking sector to target customers with an annual income of Rs2-5 lakh said that a few large public sector banks have already started implementing  digital solutions to adapt to newer technologies and are trying to open up a large base of customers. He pointed out that working with banks had not been an easy ride. The problem, he said, was that the banks were unwilling to employ something new quickly and integrate it into their processes.For example, we have been talking about e-KYC (electronic know-your-customer) for years. The thing is that if you take paper-based KYC, the cost of acquiring a customer is about Rs1,000, but with e-KYC this cost is at about Rs60, which can further be brought down to Rs5, Hariharan said.The best way to move forward with digitization would be to embrace cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, said Mukhi. According to Mukhi, this would easily weed out any security concerns at banks and ensure that hackers do not get access to peoples money.We will solve our cybersecurity problem if we use cryptocurrencies in our banking systems, Mukhi said.Going ahead, banks would be looking at alliances with specialists to take digitization forward, predicted Makhijani of KPMG.It is difficult for a bank CIO to take a decision since there are so many types of technology available. It would largely depend on vagaries of their businesses and they may not want to do everything alone, Makhijani said.A challenge that the banking system faced was that with so many developments happening in the financial technology space, many of the innovations might be getting bypassed, said Vaidyanathan. Focusing on certain things such as scanning of multiple documents through fiber optic technology might not even be necessary, since most application and complaint processes had now been automated.Vaidyanathan also urged bankers to make more efforts to popularise the unified payments interface (UPI).The panel also discussed the banking sectors handling of demonetisation, where large queues were seen outside branches for many days. According to the panellists, while banks handled the situation well, issues were also caused due to the mindset of the average customer who doesnt fully trust digital payment options.",2017-01-30,0S81b1kQmceoP1OAaligcK,"At the 10th Mint Annual Banking Conclave, bankers discuss whether the Indian banking system is missing key opportunities in its rush to adopt technology",both,03:07,Is the banking system overlooking key challenges in its rush to go digital?

They are talking to some of the existing investors of the company, too, to pick the stake from them, said one of the two people cited above, requesting anonymity, as the talks are private.According to the second person cited above, the bank is looking to sell its stake at a price that would value Mswipe at $200-250 million.Around the last time they raised funds, the company was valued at close to $150 million. The price which they are seeking could get them up to $20 million for their stake, he said.The last fund-raising at Mswipe was in July 2015, when the company raised Rs160 crore in a Series C round from new investors such as Falcon Edge Capital, Ola Cabs and Meru Capital.Existing investors Matrix Partners India, Axis Bank Ltd and DSG Consumer Partners also participated in the funding round.Axis Bank first invested in the company in early 2013.Emails sent to Axis Bank and Mswipe on Friday went unanswered.Mswipe was founded in 2012 by Manish Patel, a doctor by education, who previously co-founded an alcoholic beverages distribution company called Milestone Merchandise. Mswipe provides a mobile payment solution with a card reader, which can be attached to any mobile phones audio (headset) jack. The company also provides similar card payment solutions for smartphones.It works closely with smaller banks such as Corporation Bank, RBL Bank Ltd, Shamrao Vithal Co-op. Bank and large banks such as Axis Bank.It is also present in the Middle East, the US and South-East Asia through partnerships. Its clients include small and medium enterprises.In the payments services market, Mswipe competes with companies such as Ezetap and Paynear.In August 2015, Ezetap raised Rs150 crore from Social+Capital, Helion Advisors and Berggruen Holdings, Horizons Ventures and the Capricorn Investment Group.In December 2015, Paynear raised around Rs16 crore from a high net-worth individual investor.According to a March 2015 report by Ken Research, the payment services industry grew at a compound annual growth rate of 147.6% between the financial years 2012 and 2014.The research firm believes that the Indian payments market will continue to grow at a strong rate going ahead. The payments market is driven largely by transactions through mobile point of sale terminals and mobile banking, the report said.For Axis Bank, plans to sell its stake in Mswipe come at a time when the bank is facing stress due to loans that soured.In the quarter to September, the private sector bank reported a 83% plunge in net profit at Rs319 crore, primarily on account of higher provisioning for bad loans.The bank had posted a net profit of Rs1,915.64 crore in the same period in 2015-16.Gross non-performing assets (NPA) and net NPAs at the bank rose to 4.17% and 2.02%, respectively in the quarter.",2016-11-15,0SArJpfqkiCBj82GYYIncL,Axis Bank may sell its 8% stake in mobile payments firm Mswipe for around $20 million in a deal that is likely to value that firm at $200-250 million,both,00:47,Axis Bank in talks to sell Mswipe stake
-0.66,"Surprisingly, in less than a month after the March quarter results were announced, stocks of leading hotel chains in the country have bounced back after years of doing nothing much. Shares of Indian Hotels Co. Ltd (IHCL), represented by the Taj brand, lead the pack and are up 25%. Another stock, TajGVK Hotels and Resorts Ltd, is up 18%, while others like EIH Ltd are inching up too.
				   
				The reason for the sudden appetite for hotel stocks is the better-than-expected recovery in the domestic hospitality business. March quarter revenue grew by around 10%, with operating margin expansion beating analysts estimates.Moreover, the clouds of overcapacity in the luxury hotel segment are gradually receding. Prospects for better room tariffs and occupancy rates (ORs) are thus improving. An analysts presentation by IHCL says that while supply of rooms increased by 3.9% during fiscal year 2016 over the previous year, demand grew by 10.5%.Interestingly, demand growth is being fuelled by higher domestic ORs across cities. If this continues, room rates could gradually move up, leading to growth in average revenue per room.And thats not all. Foreign tourist arrivals (FTA) into the country grew by 10% in the first three months of calendar year 2016. This is commendable, given the damp global economic sentiment and after the single-digit growth seen annually since 2009.All these factors promise a rise in revenue in the medium term, very important for luxury hotel chains that have been languishing with excess capacity. Further, the fact that most hotels have deferred or cancelled any expansion plans is good news, as it will help improve balance sheet health of these firms.Some are trying to trim existing debt too. According to ICICI Securities Ltd, IHCLs debt should come down in the coming years, given its strategy to follow an asset-light business model, where it will undertake more contracts. Its plan to divest low-margin yielding assets, like the one in Boston, will improve cash flows and profitability in the long run. This may be the reason why IHCLs stock outperformed its peers in the last one month. Likewise, TajGVKs stock is rallying after it posted a strong recovery in operating margin in the March quarter on the back of better operating leverage and lower raw material cost.That said, some luxury hotel chains like Hotel Leela Venture Ltd are in dire straits with operating loss, debt burgeoning to 18 times the equity and obvious inability to service interest charges on borrowings. Of course, a discerning Street has consistently punished this stock, which after steadily falling is now hardly on the investors radar.",2016-06-24,0SzjCOcC7hwJ0aAKDgzZyL,"In less than a month after the March quarter results were announced, stocks of leading hotel chains in the country have bounced back after years of doing nothing much

-0.69,"Akash Gupta is co-founder and chief technology officer at GreyOrange, a robotics firm founded in 2011 along with his friend and partner Samay Kohli, who is the chief executive officer.  In an interview, Gupta talks about the journey of GreyOrange and its future plans. Edited excerpts:
				   
				Tell us something about your background and how you got interested in robotics.
Samay and I met at BITS Pilani. He is two years my senior and we met during a human robotics project where we were trying to build robots, got interested in human robotics, built the AcYut and took part in a lot of competitions all around the world, represented India in the human robotics competitions. The ROBOlympics (now RoboGames) happens in San Francisco every year so the first time we came sixth, then got the bronze and then finally got the gold. We took part in the midsize humanoid category, which is basically where a human-looking robot, about a metre in height, is involved in a kung fu competition with another robot. These robots are remote-controlled. Then, we gradually started building autonomous humanoid robots to take part in a soccer competition for robots. So we added vision, so that the robots could kick the ball, and take their own autonomous decisions while playing. After this, we got requests for giving workshops/tutorials on humanoid robotics. Humanoid as a project is very expensive as it costs Rs40-45 lakh a year on three robots, so there was no option but to raise funds for the same. For this purpose, we formed a company and called it GreyOrange. We did about 35-40 workshops in 2011 and were enjoying ourselves but soon figured out this was not something we wanted to do in the long-term. So we shifted from doing workshops to doing product development for different companies like C&C Technologies in the US and some South Korean companies. But we were not getting good at anything because the products were from different domains. We realized that we were not building any core competency, so both Samay and I thought that we should try to focus on one particular industry. So we did some research, had some industries in mind for automation like the railways, which is highly non-automated, oil and gas maintenance, and  e-commerce and warehousing. The problem with the first two industries was that they were very slow at that time while e-commerce was developing, so we chose that industry to start  building products. At that point of time we also met Wolfgang Hoeltgen in Germany in one of the science and technology fairs at Hanover, and he really liked our idea and provided us with angel funding. In January 2012, we took our first office in Gurgaon and spent about Rs55 lakh on hardware prototyping and that was a really good decision because it helped our product development capability more than what anything else would have done. We started with two products: the butler system and sortation system, and fast forward to today where we have more than 500 people, three product lines (the butler system, linear sortation and cross-belt sortation), 50-plus installations.Describe your products and how they help automate warehouses?
Linear sortation systems are used to sort shipments. One of the major use case is once your shipments are picked and packed, they need to be sorted according to destinations or locations, because then they need to catch corresponding trucks or flights, so our sortation systems helps you sort that and also capture the volumetric and weight of the packetthis is required for billing for the courier company.Linear sortation system is like a conveyor machine that has arms that help in sorting packages and have different throughput which means the number of packets that can be sorted and weighed in an hour. So the machine can sort from 1,500 packets an hour to about 14,000 an hour. You can also use this system to combine different items in orders. What the butler system does is when an order is placed, then somebody takes a pick-list and picks the ordered objects from different parts of the warehouse, comes back, sorts them, packs them and sends them. The butler makes the picking, putting combining very, very easy. What it does is it completely transforms the paradigm from man going to the goods to goods coming to the man. In the butler system, the people stand at the periphery of the warehousewe call these pick-put stationsand the bots basically bring the racks to them for whatever they need to pick. Bots will then go and store the racks back to their location. So lets say in an apparel industry 120-180 items per day can be picked manually, the butler system can pick 300-600 items in an hourthats the kind of jump we are talking about in the throughput of the warehouse.  The whole process is really dynamic and the order goes directly to our server and the server directs the robots. This has reduced pilferage too, as we have limited the interaction of people to the periphery. What are your future plans and strategy?
There is a lot of innovation you can drive through these products, every six months we are driving new features, improving speed, giving more customization to our clients. There is room for a lot of optimization, efficiency and accuracy, so we are constantly working on that.  We have one major R&D (research and development) office in Gurgaon, but we have service centres across India. We are expanding to South-East Asia. We have an office in Singaporethere is a 14-people team that looks at solutions, marketing, sales. South-East Asia is a big market and since the past 12 months we are going aggressively into it. We have also invested in a company in Japan that is our exclusive partner for distributing our butler systems in there. So we are in process of installing butler systems in Japan. The Middle East is a growing market with Saudi Arabia, so we have set up an office there and we are starting operations there. We also have a small office in Hong Kong and are now looking to expand to Germany. So now our major impetus is expanding overseas and getting a few anchor clients overseas. As regards the products, we are building newer versions every 6-12 months. We invest heavily in R&D as thats the core of our company. We would like to disrupt our products every three years. We also have people working on R&D from outside India, so they can start contributing to the product since we expect to serve a global market so its important to get perspective from different geographies. We are hiring engineers from Germany and the US, so our R& D team is cross-geography. How do you envision your company 10 years down the line?
We are definitely looking to get public and an IPO (initial public offering) is one of the most viable options to take this forward. But not immediately. One thing we are trying to build at the core is a very strong product engine at the back-end, have a team of people who can produce very complex, good quality hardware plus software products, which is the core of the company. If you build a good product engine, then you can pick any industry and disrupt it by building these products. So we are giving thought to things like product life cycle, processes, how we train our engineers and build products that are reliable, have a high life cycle of 7-10 years, are of international quality and are globally acceptable. That is one of the challenges, so we really dont want only to build a butler or sorter but to build a strong product engine so that every three years we take an industry and disrupt it. Thats where we want to reach before we do any IPO.So the next 12-18 months are going to be all about global expansion and reducing our warehousing cost to the lowest possible and adding more products to our portfolio, so that we have a range of products. On the software side, we are building a platform that can run a warehouse end-to-end.",2016-09-26,0W6HaSp2RRPe1CYw3fkxXM,"Akash Gupta, co-founder and chief technology officer at GreyOrange, speaks about the journey of GreyOrange and its future plans

0.07,"Biocon Ltd, Indias leading biopharmaceutical firm will likely see its biosimilars business take off in the US and the European Union in the next three years, enabling it to reach the guided $1-billion revenue mark by 2018-19. Its application for breast cancer biosimilar trastuzumab was recently accepted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for review and applications for three biosimilars have been accepted by the European Medicines Agency. 
				   
				In an interview, Biocons chairperson and managing director Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw says that launch of trastuzumab in the US, once approved, will not be immediate and its Rs460-crore insulin supply pact with the  Malaysian government will de-risk Biocons investment in setting up the plant there. Edited excerpts:Biocon has filed applications for three biosimilars in the EU and one in the US. By when do you expect these products to be approved and launched?The US FDA has given the target action date for trastuzumab as 3 September, 2017, which is very soon. It is a very good date to get as it means that our dossier is worthy of review. Even if they give us approval around that time, we still have patent issues to circumvent. So, it is not as if once you get approval, you can launch the product tomorrow. We will have to overcome certain patent disputes that the innovator is going to raise. Once we get over that we will get clarity on the launch date, so as of now, I am unable to give you any optics on that. EU is less of a hassle because patents are not there and that might give us an earlier entry point into the EU. I think we have done the best we can and we are very confident and optimistic about getting a favourable response from the regulators.Trastuzumab is filed both in the US and EU, while pegfilgrastim and insulin glargine are filed only in the EU so far. When does the company plan to file these two products in the US?We will file the other products too. Pegfilgrastim is the next one in the US, which we will do soon. Glargine will also follow it. The requirements of the US and the EU are slightly different, so even though we have filed glargine in the EU, it will take a little longer to file in the US. Both the filings are likely to be made this year. Apart from these, we are on track to submit the filing of another biosimilar adalimumab in FY18. The company launched insulin glargine in Japan a few months back. What has been the response to the drug and are you gaining market share?It is doing pretty well. Japan is not such a big market for us. It is an about $140-million market and both Eli Lilly and Biocon are there in the biosimilar insulin glargine space. Biocon is marketing the product through Fujifilm Pharma. Sanofis share has been eroded. Fujifilm is far more optimistic about market share now than they were in the initial stages. Patients and doctors are very happy with our product and our device. Therefore we have an opportunity to garner good market share. Now that the Malaysian insulin facility has been commercialized, can you tell us which markets will be catered to by that plant and will the investments made for setting up the plant put some stress on the companys balance sheet?The biggest news for us was our offtake agreement with Malaysias health ministry. It is a very important event for us because it defrays a lot of our capital investment in Malaysia, which otherwise we would have had to keep idle till we got product approvals in regulated markets. Our investment in the Malaysian facility is $250 million. We are confident that a large part of our fixed costs, depreciation and interest costs for the Malaysian plant will be catered to by the Malaysian governments offtake agreement and our emerging market supplies. So next year we expect either a break-even or a marginal loss for the Malaysia facility and in the scheme of things, at the consolidated level, the impact will be negligible. Meanwhile, we are getting inspected by some of the emerging markets, so once they sign off we will start supplying to them from Malaysia. The European application for glargine is filed from Malaysia, so once the approval comes, we will be able to supply to Europe. We do not want to starve any market. Right now we are starving markets because our India capacity is completely sold out. Going forward, we want to make our supply capabilities so flexible that at any point of time any market need can be catered to by either of the two facilities. What is the companys plan for growing the small molecules and branded formulations business?In the small molecules business, we have done very well in supplying differentiated APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredients) in the global market. We believe that complex molecules is where we will be good and in fermentation of small molecules. We want to move up the value chain and create ANDAs (abbreviated new drug applications) and generics. At the moment, we have very good backward integration because we have the APIs, but we want to integrate forward. We have got our first ANDA approval for rosuvastatin but it is not going to move the needle for us because we are one of many players. We will also have a late-mover disadvantage. But we have many more products in the pipeline, some of them might be first to file. We plan to file 15-20 ANDAs over the next few years. We will look at differentiating ourselves so that we do not have too much of a crowded space. For the small molecules business, I think we will see the needle move from FY19. In the branded formulations business, we are making a lot of organizational changes. Thats an area where we are not being able to deliver the way we had expected as we had leadership issues. Now we have brought in someone who understands the business better. We expected this business to reach $200 million but that we may or may not be able to achieve by FY19. But the deficit from branded formulations will be made up by biosimilars.",2017-01-31,0auGGgikpByBHoglKn9DcL,Biocon chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw says Rs460 crore insulin supply pact with Malaysian government will de-risk Biocons investment in setting up the plant there,competitor,23:40,Break-even or marginal loss for Biocon Malaysia next year: Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw
-0.56,"A presentation that Tata Global Beverages Ltd made last week to US-based investors gave a spring to its share briefly, before it cracked along with the market in the aftermath of Indias surgical strike across the border. After gaining 5% mid-week, it closed the week ended 30 September below the previous weeks close.
				   
				One item in the presentation, in particular, may have caught the attention of investors. Going forward, it says, the company wants to increase focus on India, beef up its presence in Asia and the Middle East, and re-evaluate stressed businesses. That may be a good thing.Now, the focus on India may seem strange. After all, South Asia (mainly comprising India) already contributes to 42% of turnover. Other important markets are Great Britain and EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) which contribute to 30% of sales, and the US, Canada and Australia which contribute to 28%. Tea is the major product, accounting for nearly three-fourths of sales except in the US, where its coffee. The coffee business is mainly under its listed subsidiary Tata Coffee Ltd.So, why is this shift in focus important? Black tea consumption is going down in many developed markets, although its not a new development. Over the years, Tata Global has ventured into newer forms of tea, such as green, speciality, fruit infusions and the like. But the going is not easy. For one, the market is competitive and retailers drive a tough bargain to give consumers good prices. Second, the market for other types of tea is relatively fragmented.Also, the lowering of black tea consumption is not being replaced fully by other forms of tea. In the UK, for instance, sales of ordinary tea bags are estimated to have declined by 14% between 2013 and 2016, according to market research provider Mintel. While sales of varieties such as green, speciality and herbal grew, that was not enough. Overall tea sales are estimated to decline by 5% in 2016. In markets such as these, across Europe and Canada, Tata Globals focus is on growing in the non-black tea segment, and growing or at least maintaining share in the shrinking black tea market. Thats an uphill task.That explains the focus on markets such as South Asia, where India is the main market but neighbouring countries are tea drinking markets too. The Middle East too is a good opportunity. These countries will have established and strong incumbents, making it difficult to grow market share. In India, where its the market leader, the opportunity is to convert more people drinking loose tea to branded tea, and then nudge them up to drink its premium stuff.In South Asia, at least the core black tea market is still a growing one. A relook at stressed businesses could mean a lowering of losses, which should benefit profitability. Tata Global had taken impairments in some Eastern European markets earlier.Eventually, all this has to translate to higher growth and returns from the tea business. In FY16, the companys operating income rose by 1.4% while operating profit fell by 17%. FY17 is off to a good start with the June quarter operating profit rising by 32%. Some of that is attributable to lower commodity costs, which can change depending on annual global tea leaf output. Tata Globals share has risen by over a fifth in the past three months, partly on expectations of a better performance. If it does embark on a path that promises to lower costs and grow revenues, investors would be happy to come along for the ride.",2016-10-02,0m4SIpscOwgzqHT8fxyOeN,"If Tata Global Beverages does embark on a path that promises to lower costs and grow revenues, investors would be happy to come along for the ride",competitor,23:51,Tata Global Beverages: in search of tea drinkers
-0.25,"Ahmedabad: Billionaire Gautam Adani, chairman of the Adani Group, talks about the companys $16 billion coal project in Australia in an interview after winning a series of court battles that once threatened to derail the controversial mining project.
ALSO READ | Gautam Adani says debt level not a concern, eyes new sectorsThe Gujarat-based businessman also discusses his plans for solar, the next sunrise sectors for the group, the changing Indian economic scenario, compensatory tariff issues for its thermal power plants and the Adani Sagar Mala, a string of ports across the country. Edited excerpts:After much delay, your plans to build one of the worlds largest coal mines in Australia seems back on track with the recent court rulings being in your favour and the Australian government extending full support to the project. How do you see your Australian dreams unfolding? Also, you have faced similar resistance from environmental groups in India too in the past. What do you find in common in the two?After four long years of approval processes and unnecessary  struggles in courts, we have finally overcome the hurdles and we hope to take it to our board (Adani Enterprises) for final investment decisions by March. The Carmichael mine, rail and port project includes the development of a world-class mine with phase one production of 25 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) in FY21. This includes 388-km standard gauge multi-user railway line of 60 mtpa capacity and related port expansions. The coal from this mine would be used to fire our power projects in Mundra and Udupi.The recent successful meeting with Australian federal, state and regional leaders not only enhanced our confidence but also has paved the way for enhancing trade multi-fold between the two nations.The much-needed infrastructure for the project will open up the Galilee Basin and put Australia in a competitive position in a global sea-borne market. The total life of mine capex is about $16 billion and we would have invested about $4.5 billion in the first phase.Now, coming to the other part, I will tell you that we remain fully committed and very confident of the environmental impact studies we commission and all this information is public. Be it India or Australia or any other country, the impact studies we do are world-class and we use consultants of global repute to augment our very strong internal team.There have been several positive recent court outcomes in Australia that rejected the claims of what are largely activist-inspired appeals and uphold the strong approvals process by the governments in Australia that we have complied with. These activist-motivated appeals are at odds with the strong local community support in the regions the projects are based. So, the court wins provide more confidence around the project time-frames for Adani and meeting demand in India as well as for the supporting communities in Australia.Just like any other company in our sector, there will always be some resistance for different reasons and its a part of our business to be able to address these in a transparent and scientific manner.There are both differences and similarities between activist activities in the two nations. Increasingly these are political campaigns with wider objectives and often with funding and support by global NGOs. Regrettably, these campaigns often dont recognize that in many respects, India and Adani are at the forefront of finding the right balance between our leadership on renewable energy and the fact that our developing economy also needs the affordable thermal energy that many other nations still rely on for their base load.We continue to look for opportunities in mining sector across the globe as we aspire to be world leaders in the integrated pit-to-plug strategy in our energy vertical. It includes mines, rail and port developments.You seem to have got a clear ambition to be a dominant player in the sectors that you venture into, be it ports, power, mining or the more recently forayed renewable energy business. What is the next sunrise sector for you?It is important to understand that for a growth economy like India, even our core sectors of ports, power (including solar) and mining remain sunrise sectors, given the sheer potential ahead. All you need to do is to look at China and see what they have done over the past 25 years to be able to realize that the real period of growth for India within our core sectors is still ahead of us. A 7+% GDP (gross domestic product) growth rate and the strong policy advocacy that we are seeing from the government will provide the additional tail wind for companies like us to keep growing our business at healthy double-digit rates.That being said, we are certainly evaluating other sectors that include coal conversions, defence and water. However, its too early to say which of these would be the next sunrise sector for us.Solar seems to have taken a top priority for the group in recent times. You have also set up the worlds largest solar plant in Tamil Nadu.Solar indeed has taken a significant priority and is a great example of how rapidly we capitalize on opportunities. Over the past 18 months, we have built a confirmed pipeline of 2,000MW of solar power, commissioned the worlds largest solar plant in Tamil Nadu in a record period of nine months.We have a target of contributing 10% of capacity in the national target under Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) of 100,000MW of grid-connected solar power by 2022. Accordingly, we aim to set up 10,000MW of solar power plants and at least 10,000MW of solar parks during this period. One has to remember that ultimately, the speed of learning cycles and the execution experience makes all the difference and at this time, we are doing this perhaps faster than any other player in the world. In Australia too, we have focused plans to enter the renewable energy sector.You have announced $1 billion for a solar panels and solar cells production facility. What kind of opportunity do you see in solar manufacturing for an Indian company?We are in the process of commissioning a 1.2GW, Indias largest integrated solar manufacturing facility, to produce polysilicon, ingots, wafers, cells and modules and ancillary products under Make in India initiative at Mundra (Gujarat) in multiple phases.One has to understand that under the JNNSM programme, we are talking about establishing a 100GW solar generation capacity by 2022. No country in the world has ever accelerated their solar programmes at the pace this government has set out to do. India is set to become one of the leaders in the world in renewable energy generation in the days to come. Indian solar power market is expected to grow at CAGR of more than 60% for next five to 10 years. With solar tariffs coming in grid parity with that of thermal power and going forward is expected to come down further, future energy demand will be met from the solar projects.Currently, Indian solar manufacturing is inefficient compared to some international markets due to many reasons like obsolete and inflexible units of existing manufacturers, lack of economy of scale, dependence on imported raw material, etc. Large scale, end to end, vertically integrated solar manufacturing facility like that at Mundra will have a significant edge over currently established cell and module manufacturing units in India and can easily compete with worlds leading producers. Yes, there will be competition, but one has to recognize that we must have the confidence that the only way we can be a major player in the solar area is to be able to compete across the solar value chain using global benchmarks and therefore we need to use our integrated strategy as a differentiator.There were reports about your talks to take over some assets of Sun Edison in India. What is the current status? We evaluate various business opportunities continuously. Lot of projects in India, which were aggressively bid out, are in market looking for buyers/investors. Some of these were just taken to be later sold to potential buyers before or soon after the development. We looked at some of the assets but then decided that it made more sense to organically develop the businessat least as of now. As regards Sun Edison, we heard from media reports that Greenko is in advanced stage of discussions.Moving from solar, tell us what is happening in thermal power projects. The fluctuating coal prices and compensation tariff have been a concern for the company for quite some time now.From the very beginning, our goal has been to generate 20,000MW by 2020. Indian power sector has witnessed rapid advancement over the past few years with installed capacity surpassing 300GW and electricity demand reaching 1,100 billion units. Indias current per capita power consumption is over 1,000kWh (kilowatt hour) per capita per annum and aspires to reach 2,000kWh per capita per annum by 2024. With current power-generation capacity of around 11,000MW, Adani Power is already the largest private power producer in India. We have always ensured fast-paced execution of projects and implemented the best available technologies and practices that can serve as benchmarks for the power industry.The company has already got relief from Appellate Tribunal for Electricity, which held in its judgment that changes in Indonesian regulations affecting discounted coal prices under contract is a force majeure event under the PPAs (power-purchase agreements) and asked the central regulator to grant appropriate relief. The matter has been sub judice from last four years and therefore, though coal price is falling, the company has been under severe financial stress due to delay in grant of appropriate relief. Despite a long legal battle, we are honouring our commitments to supply power. Similarly, grant of relief is also pending for the tariff of power supply from Kawai (Rajasthan) and Tiroda (Maharashtra) power plants.Are you looking for further expansions or acquisitions in the power sector?Yes, we are looking to continue our expansion and I expect some of it will be inorganic. The Indian power sector is witnessing consolidation among the private sector developers. We are looking at all opportunities, brownfield and greenfield projects. A lot of the power projects up for acquisition come with multiple challenges such as transmission evacuation, rail connectivity, no PPA, no domestic coal supply and many more.How have things changed in the power sector under the new leadership at the centre?The proof of success lies in metrics and I think the numbers speak for themselves. I have already spoken about how solar power has been catalysed by the policy initiatives taken by the government. Average solar tariffs are now at Rs4 per unit and this is a tremendous achievement by any yardstick or measure and the long-term cascading benefits of this in helping industries, getting power to rural areas as well as galvanizing the solar value chain in India will be significant.From providing a lifeline to the ailing state-owned power distribution utilities (discoms) in the form of UDAY (Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana) scheme, introducing amendments in the National Tariff Policy, ramping up the countrys traditionally neglected transmission network and boosting domestic coal supply, many initiatives have been introduced by the centre to facilitate sustainable growth in the power sector.In our view, the centre has set the reform process in motion, which has already made a difference, but the full impact will be felt only in the long run.For the groups most successful business, ports, has there been any change in strategy for attaining your previously articulated goal of reaching 200 mtpa by 2020? Also, you have built a huge network of ports across the country, making acquisitions in the east and south. What is the overall strategy?With a strategy to serve large Indian hinterland, APSEZ (Adani Ports and SEZ Ltd) has developed and operates 10 ports/terminals across the coastline of India. All our ports and terminals are strategically located, making a string of ports or the Adani Sagar Mala. This network of multi-cargo ports enables us to cater to major consumption and resource-rich regions of India. The addition of the Kattupalli port (in Tamil Nadu) earlier this year to augment our flanking strategy along with its sister Ennore port in Chennai has been yet another success with volumes at the Kattupalli port already doubling since we have taken over operations. Kattupalli has a tremendous location and we plan to convert it to a multi-cargo port to further capitalize on this advantage. In Kerala, our plan to build out the Vizhinjam transhipment port at the southern-most tip of India is on track and this will be yet another strategic port that will draw traffic from the worlds busiest shipping routes as well as allow our own countrys traffic to be transhipped within our country.In FY16, we handled a cargo volume of 151 MMT and we are expecting 10-15% cargo growth in FY17. While we are seeing growth in cargo handling at our existing ports, we are also expanding our presence across the Indian coastline. Given the growth rates, we have seen in the ports sector and the progress made over the last few years we will reach our target of 200 mtpa well before 2020, most likely well before the end of 2018.We are also targeting to provide value-added services to our customers in form of integrated logistics solutions, which is going to enhance growth prospects of our ports. Having presence across the coastline of India is going to be a key factor in this initiative. Our logistics business has seen record growth over the past three years and is well set to capitalize on the logistics boom as we expand our network of warehouses, ICDs and transportation capabilities. Ultimately, as part of our strategy, we want to be a one-stop shop for many of our major customers.Currently, we are focusing on timely completion of our LNG and LPG terminals at Mundra and Dhamra, coastal shipping, container trans-shipment and improvement in operational efficiency by leveraging technology. We are confident that all these initiatives together will help us in reaching our goal. Mundra is today the largest commercial port of the country, handling over 110 mtpa. How do you continue to keep this momentum going given some stiff competition given by government-controlled major ports especially Kandla Port, your closest competitor in terms of traffic and commercial cargo volumes handled?Mundra is our flagship port and a true success story, which has given new goals to the port sector in India. We are expanding capacity at Mundra port and container terminal 4 would be operational soon.Mundra enjoys superior operational efficiencies owing to its investment in evolving commodity-specific infrastructure such as fully mechanized coal import terminal, fertilizer cargo complex and mechanized steel yard, among others. These facilities ensure best service levels at Mundra port. These coupled with our long-term relationships with stakeholders such as shipping lines and key customers are key factors in maintaining long-term competitiveness in the region and the country. More than 65% of our cargo being handled under long-term service contracts with various customers across various cargo types. These advantages continue to help Mundra port grow, which registered a 12% y-o-y growth in 2016-17.In fact, spurt in cargo handling at Tuna Tekra is one of the significant reasons behind the recent cargo growth visible at Kandla port. (Tuna Tekra is a terminal operated by APSEZ and falls under the purview of Kandla Port Trust.)The upcoming LNG and LPG terminals at Mundra port are going to further strengthen the niche position of the port in the market. Having SEZ, DTA and FTWZ create right ecosystem for the port to offer a long-term advantage to our customers. Furthermore, we continue to focus on efficiency improvement through several operational and technological initiatives to increase value-edge. As highlighted, our integrated logistics service offering is going to add further value to our customers, enhancing their convenience and ease of handling logistics through Mundra port and our other ports in India.How do you see your acquisitions in ports? How do you see them fit in your overall growth plans?Our strategy remains on track as we have built out a network of 10 ports all the way from Mundra (in Gujarat) in the west to Dhamra (in Odisha) in the east. The acquisition of the Dhamra port in 2013 has been a huge success from the operational and strategic perspective and we turned around the performance in the very first year. Given the focus on coastal shipping, we should see a further step change in the performance of Dhamra. The port has increased significantly from handling around 10 mtpa cargo to a port targeting to handle around 21 mtpa cargo in 2016-17. It is being envisioned to replicate success of Mundra port for the east coast. We plan to undertake major capacity enhancements at Dhamra port, taking its current capacity from 20 mtpa to 100 mtpa in future.You have also ventured into defence, where you have floated a separate entity. What is happening there?We are in various discussions to enable the Make in India programme, but its too early for me to make any comment.Some time ago, Adani Group got the environmental nod for setting up a shipbuilding yard in Kutch. Can you elaborate on your plans and also if you plan to build ships for the defence sector.Its too early to elaborate on any of these plans. However, there is no plan for us to build ships for the defence sector.What about your plans to enter the financial services sector? There were reports of Adani planning to acquire Macquarie NBFC.This has been done in a private domain by the promoters.There has been quite a buzz about Adani being a debt-heavy company. What is your take on this? As you are aware, infra is a capital-intensive business. At group level, our long-term debt: Ebitda is at a comfortable level of 3.25:1. The corresponding value of net fixed asset is Rs125,000 crore. Overall, for infra business, we are robustly placed.The social sector is being given more focus in the past couple of years with new CSR guidelines in place. What areas is Adani focusing on? The areas that the Adani Foundation focuses on are education, community health, sustainable livelihood and rural infrastructure. Adani Foundations education programmes have already touched the lives of over 150,000 young students, the healthcare programmes touches the lives of over 200,000 people every year, the sustainable livelihood programs have made over 35,000 people and their entire families self-reliant and the rural infrastructure programmes have improved the lives of over 500,000 people across 177 villages by helping provide better roads, drinking water and other basic facilities.What about ventures like real estate, promoted by the family?Adani Realty, our youngest venture, is vigorously expanding its offering of high-quality residential, commercial, affordable and township projects in Mumbai, Gurgaon and Ahmedabad. Our execution is always on track with improving focus on satisfying customer needs and trust. Shantigram is probably one of Indias finest mixed-use townships already. Despite the temporary downturn in the realty sector, you will hear more about Adani Realty and its ambitious growth plans ahead.How do you see the overall Indian economy for industries today under the government at the centre? A lot has been written about your proximity to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. How do you view this?Ultimately, we should let the metrics speak for themselves. India continues to remain the bright spot in the otherwise slowing global economy. It has been and will also be in 2016-17 the fastest-growing major economy, growing at 7.5% as against a global economy that is projected to grow at 3.5%. Today, there is increasing recognition that a large part of the growth is a result of the policies that the government has moved to quickly introduce reforms after coming to power. FDI (foreign direct investment) is a sign of global confidence and FDI over the past 24 months in India has grown 46% and stands at $62 billion, which is an all-time record. In my opinion, we are just getting started and the actual benefits will be realized by the industries over the next decade.The next generation of Adani Group seems to be gearing up for the future. Your elder son Karan Adani was earlier this year appointed as new CEO of APSEZ. How do you see him taking bigger responsibilities?Karan has now been involved in the ports business for over seven years now and I am proud of the way he has developed himself with the strategic and operational role he has played over the years. He has built a well-rounded leadership team who can capitalize on the opportunities in the sector. I am confident that the next phase of expansion that we will see under his leadership will help APSEZ further strengthen its position as a port and port-led development company.",2016-12-19,0v3GPxrwuJA6gebfOMy7iN,"Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani on the Australian coal mine project, plans for the solar power sector and Adani ports along Indias coastline",both,02:36,We aspire to be world leaders with our integrated pit-to-plug strategy: Adani

				The RIL stock has risen 9.5% since 2 September to Rs1,109.35. During this time, the S&P BSE Sensex index has fallen 0.8%.Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds long-awaited commercial launch has reduced the prolonged period of uncertainty that surrounded this venture. While it was clear that RIL was betting big on the telecom sector, there was no clarity on the launch date or  pricing strategy. Both questions have now been answered, and some analysts are excited about the companys prospects of gaining reasonable market share.To be sure, Jios success cant be taken for granted, especially as far as returns from the venture go. In a recent interview, RILs chairman Mukesh Ambani suggested that Jio was targeting a return of 18-19% on capital. That wont be easy to achieve. Analysts from Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd indicate that achieving that would require revenues that are close to market leader Bharti Airtel Ltds; and a similar Arpu (average revenue per user) profile as the top three companies in the sector (around Rs210) at Bharti Airtels subscriber base (250 million). We believe such returns can be difficult to achieve in the first four years, they wrote  in a note to clients on 19 September.But Jio isnt the only reason for the renewed excitement around RIL shares. Benchmark Singapore complex gross refining margins (GRMs) have surged this month. GRM is a measure of profitability for refining firms. According to an analyst, Singapore GRM, the difference between the per barrel price of crude oil and the value of products distilled from it, touched $7 a barrel on Friday. In the June quarter, average GRM was at $5 a barrel. RILs refining business contributed as much as 68% of the companys stand-alone earnings before interest and tax in the June quarter. Additionally, RIL is also expected to benefit from higher light-heavy and lower Brent-Dubai spreads.Besides, analysts expect it to generate high free cash flow (FCF) from 2017-18. RIL is coming out of its capex phase, which in our view will pave the way for a multiyear cycle of strong FCF generation averaging $5 billion per annum over F1Y8-20, implying >11% FCF yield, wrote analysts from Morgan Stanley Research in a report on 25 September. RIL will benefit from the start of earnings delivery from downstream, which we expect to add ~$3.2 billion in Ebitda by FY18, assuming oil prices remain low at $50 a barrel. Ebitda, or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, is an indicator of operating profitability.But note that despite the recent outperformance, investors have lost out considerably from a long-term perspective.  The RIL stock has underperformed the Sensex in the last seven years by a huge margin. Currently, one share trades at 12.6 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year.

				Revenue rose 20% on a 25% growth in volume.In the previous eight quarters, revenue and volume had increased in the range of 2-19%. Strong growth in Latin America helped the company report a robust performance.Late sowing of corn in the region led to sales spill-over from the December quarter. Also, UPLs products for rice, fruits and vegetables performed well in Mexico and Columbia.As a result, operating profit jumped 25%. Margins expanded 90 basis points to 22.6%. According to Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd, this is the companys best ever quarterly margin. The company ended 2015-16 with a revenue growth of 10%. The growth is slower than the 12-17% increase the company saw in the last two fiscals. But the performance should be seen in the context of the demand and currency headwinds that the industry is facing.The global crop protection market is estimated to have contracted 10% in 2015. Brazil, one of the key markets for agrochemical firms, declined 23%. Despite this, UPL has grown revenue, thanks to market share gains.According to Sharekhan Ltd, the management maintained its guidance of 12-15% revenue growth and 60-100 basis points margin expansion in the current fiscal. The growth is expected to be driven by new product launches and market share gains, especially in Latin America.The robust performance and guidance have led to an earnings upgrade. HDFC Securities Ltd and Emkay raised their sales, operating profit estimates for the current fiscal. But Emkay downgraded the stock citing run-up in the share priceits up 15% in the last fiscal. While the gains are not spectacular, weighing on sentiment is the companys renewed focus on capital expenditure. According to Emkay, the company is likely to incur a capex of Rs.800-900 crore per annum for the next couple of years to expand and upgrade capacities. A growing firm like UPL cannot avoid investments. But the fear is that aggressive capex can limit free cash flows and delay the balance sheet improvement measures. Also, it brings back earlier memories of UPL pursuing inorganic growth, which undermined key financial ratios and stock valuations.

				An all-cash deal, the transaction includes Rs.72,800 crore ($10.9 billion) for Essar Oils refining and retail assets, and Rs.13,300 crore ($2 billion) for Vadinar port and related infrastructure. According to one of the sources directly involved in the deal, the total equity value of the deal stands at about $6.4 billion and $6.6 billion as debt approximately.The deal was signed at the Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) summit in Goa in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The funds realised through the deal will be used to settle Essar Group debt, said Prashant Ruia, director, Essar Group at the press meet held in Goa. The Group has a debt of about Rs.80,000 crore that it accumulated in a bid to expand operations and buy steel and oil assets overseas. We will be utilising significant portion of this for debt reduction, Ruia told reporters in Goa. The deal had been in the works since July 2015. Rosneft is worlds largest publicly listed company and will take 49% stake in Essar Oil. Netherlands-based Trafigura Group Pte., one of the worlds biggest commodity trading companies, and United Capital Partners (UCP), a Russian investment fund, will together hold the rest 49% between them. In July, Mint reported that Essar Oil is in talks with oil trading companies including Trafigura Group to sell stake in the company. Investing in EOL, which operates one of the worlds most complex refineries and runs Indias largest private sector retail network, gives the new stakeholders a strong foothold in the Indian market that will witness robust demand growth for petroleum products in the long term. The growth for refined petroleum products in the Indian market for the next five years is expected to be in the 5%-7% range, Essar Oil said in a statement. Vadinar Refinery is Indias second largest refinery contributing 9% of Indias refining output. Essar Oil also operates a pan-India network of 2,700 retail outlets.The closing of the transaction is conditional upon receiving requisite regulatory approvals and other customary conditions. The parties expect to obtain the relevant approvals before the end of the first quarter of 2017, Essar Oil said in a press statement. India allows 100% foreign direct investment in the oil and gas sector. Once the Rosneft deal is officially closed, Essar Oils refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat is likely to begin receiving crude oil from Rosneft. Last July, Essar Oil signed an agreement with Rosneft for supply of 10 million tonnes of crude per annum to the Vadinar refinery in Gujarat for 10 years.This August, Essar Oil had said that it will invest an additional Rs.1,200 crore over the next two-to-three years to upgrade its Vadinar refinery in Gujarat to boost refinery margins by $1.5 per barrel. The company, had also said that it is weighing the option of reviving its petrochemical complex project with an investment of around $1-1.5 billion.The company has already earmarked and acquired land, around 5km away from the refinery, to develop a petrochemical complex that would produce gasoline, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and propylene among other products.Essar Oil which runs a network of 2,700 operating retail outlets, has 2,850 additional outlets in various stages of implementation. Essar Oil has a target of reaching 4,300 operational outlets by the end of FY 2016-17.

Domestic volume fared worse, declining 13%. The exim business, which contributes a major share to the companys revenue, continues to suffer from a slowdown in global trade.

-0.03,"Beijing: Its goodbye China, hello virtual reality (VR) for Hugo Barra. After spending three and half years in Beijing leading smartphone-maker Xiaomi Corp.s global division, Barra is returning to Silicon Valley to head Facebooks VR efforts. 
				   
				He leaves behind an uneven legacy.Barra, 40, was hired in 2013 from Google, where he worked as head of product management for Android, to oversee Xiaomis international expansion. While he helped boost device sales in India, the company aborted a push into Brazil and its other global efforts have largely stalled. At the same time, Xiaomi lost ground in its home market to domestic competitors like Vivo and Oppo, which worked more effectively with retail stores. Barra arrived with an ambitious vision, but failed to predict and overcome rapid changes in the global smartphone market.He did a lot to build up Xiaomis mindshare internationally, said Bryan Ma, vice president for devices research at IDC in Singapore. But when you look at the hard numbers, they show mixed results.Barras surprise exit comes just a couple of weeks after co-founder and CEO Lei Jun said in a letter to employees that the company had recently faced unforgettable challenges and now needed to focus on sustainable growth. After building its success by selling only online, its now developing brick-and-mortar stores in China. Barra declined to comment for this story, but he cited several accomplishments in social media posts as he departed, including the expansion into India and more than 20 other markets. A spokesperson for Xiaomi said Thursday he would continue to advise the company for the indefinite future.When he first moved from sunny California to smoggy Beijing, Barra brought the world spotlight with him. Energetic, globe-trotting, and supremely comfortable commanding a conference-hall stage, the Brazilian-born Barra showed Xiaomi how to introduce its expanding line of products -- which include fitness bands, ear buds, and air filters -- into other countries with a fast-growing middle class.He helped to be that ambassador to the rest of the world, said IDCs Ma. He was that enthusiastic, charismatic guy on stage, who helped explain who this Chinese company was.From 2012 to 2015, Xiaomis smartphone sales rose at a furious clip, expanding more than six-fold, powered by online flash sales and savvy social-media. For parts of 2014 and 2015, Xiaomi ranked first in domestic smartphone sales, and local and international media dubbed the company the Apple of China. When Barra joined, he hoped to translate that success abroad, identifying India and Brazil as key targets. The vision was promising enough that in late 2014, Xiaomi was valued at about $45 billion, the highest for any startup in the world at the time.Yet Xiaomis position at home soon began slipping. Facing intense competition from Vivo, Oppo and other rivals, Xiaomi dropped from first to fourth among smartphone sellers in China. While it focused on online sales, its competitors worked to become more prominent in retail stores, where the vast majority of customers still buy phones. The challenges at home foreshadowed hurdles in other markets.To replicate an e-commerce model from China in India or Indonesia is not as easy as it sounds. Every country has a different internet culture, said Edward Tse, a Hong Kong-based business consultant and author of the book Chinas Disruptors, which described the early days of Xiaomi and other Chinese tech upstarts.By traveling frequently to India -- and chronicling his trips on social media -- Barra helped to build a smartphone business there with $1 billion in annual revenue, an achievement he noted in his farewell Facebook post. Xiaomi is currently ranked third in the Indian smartphone market, with 9 percent market share, according to Counterpoint Research.Hugo spearheaded the idea of how you bring Xiaomi-branded products outside of China, said Gary Rieschel, founding managing partner at Qiming Venture Partners, an early investor in Xiaomi. He works incredibly hard.Barra thanked Lei Jun and Xiaomis fans in his departure post on Facebook. This journey has been nothing short of spectacular in every way, he wrote, and I can proudly say that Xiaomi Global is the first baby I helped bring into the world.Neil Shah, Counterpoints research director in India, thinks Xiaomis performance in India may be near peaking. Theres almost a ceiling about how much you can sell online. Sixty to seventy percent of the markets are offline, he said. For online channels, Xiaomis margins are razor thin, in India and China alike. Chinese rival Vivo, which works closely with retail stores, has already overtaken Xiaomi in India.IDCs Ma says Xiaomis prospects in India look positive for the next year, but after that he isnt so sure. The story in India reflects a lot of what has been happening in China, too. As the market shifts toward offline channels, it favors Oppo and Vivo.According to IDC, India is now Xiaomis dominant overseas market -- accounting for 62 percent of its non-China shipments for the first nine months of 2016. Next up is Myanmar, accounting for 16 percent of shipments. Myanmar is not exactly the first country that comes to mind when you think of the global smartphone market, said Ma.After opening with much fanfare in the summer of 2015, Xiaomis Brazil office closed last year. The companys position in Brazilian smartphone sales peaked in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, with about 1% of the market, according to Tina Lu, head of Counterpoint Research for Latin America. Everything they were selling, they were selling at a loss, she said. Unless you assemble devices locally, you face taxes of about 60 percent. Xiaomi explored, but never finalized, plans to manufacture devices in Brazil.A former employee at Xiaomis Brazil office, which once employed 23 people, said local management struggled to distinguish itself. Beyond the pricing and brand challenges, the outpost had a difficult time coordinating strategy with Beijing, the person said.Replicating Xiaomis early success in developing economies turned out to be elusive -- with obstacles ranging from Brazils heavy taxes on foreign-assembled devices; to patent-infringement lawsuits in India; to the slow adoption of e-commerce in most developing countries compared with China.A lot of people, including myself, once thought that if a Chinese technology company can make it there in China, it can make it anywhere. But I got that wrong, said Clay Shirky, an associate professor at NYU Shanghai and author of the 2015 book on Xiaomi, Little Rice: Smartphones, Xiaomi, and the Chinese Dream.Now Xiaomi will turn greater attention to fighting for its home turf. In his recent letter to employers, Lei Jun admitted the company had lost focus as it attempted rapid expansion, into both new products and countries. Thats why we must slow our pace, and seriously learn from our mistakes, he wrote.Barra isnt the only executive departing amid the slowdown. In October, Chen Tong, a vice-president for content at Xiaomi, left the company to join news platform Yidianzixun. Zhang Jinling, a vice-president managing finance and investments, left to join Baidu Inc. Chen did not respond to a request for comment, and Zhang declined to comment.They had some glory days in the past. One can never count them out, said Tse. But for them to really come back, they need to do a lot of hard work to rebuild the brand. People in China view it now as a declining brand. Bloomberg",2017-01-27,1b62RMQZOeDcrsfVN26CTN,"Hugo Barra had joined Xiaomi with an ambitious vision, but failed to predict and overcome rapid changes in the global smartphone market.",both,18:46,"Hugo Barra, in shift to Facebook, leaves behind unfinished expansion at Xiaomi"
-0.83,"Maruti Suzuki India Ltd beat the Streets estimates comfortably on both revenue and operating profit margin for the March quarter. But curiously enough, analysts are unlikely to change earnings estimates; if anything, the results were a reminder about the headwinds the company faces.
				   
				Take Maruti Suzukis capacity constraints for instancethe company ended the year with sales of 1.43 million cars, just short of its capacity of 1.55 million cars. According to an analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage firm, even though the companys annual report puts the capacity at 1.55 million cars, the management has alluded to a lower effective capacity of 1.4 million cars. As such, Maruti Suzuki is bursting at the seams already as far as production goes. Analysts at Religare Capital Markets Ltd said in a 23 March note to clients, We expect Maruti to hit a capacity roadblock in FY17 despite efforts at debottlenecking its stated manufacturing capacity of 1.55 million units. The Gujarat plant is expected to add 250,000 units of capacity only in FY18. Production constraints would limit volume growth to an 11% (compound annual growth rate) over FY16-FY18. Besides, it looks like the commodity cycle has bottomed out and there may well be pressure on margins because of higher commodity prices. In fiscal year 2015-16, raw material costs fell by as much as 320 basis points (bps) as a percentage of sales because of low commodity prices. And finally, the rupee has depreciated against the yen in recent months, which could also put pressure on margins, as yen-denominated expenses amount to around 22% of revenues. Thus far, the company has escaped the full impact of the appreciating yen thanks to its hedges, although if forex rates persist at current levels, margins will start getting impacted soon. A basis point is 0.01%.The March quarter results, nevertheless, were fairly decent. Revenue grew by 12.5% year-on-year, far higher than the 3.9% growth in volumes, thanks to a better product mix and lower discounts.

That is why the lender, also the countrys most valuable bank, enjoys a price-to-book valuation of 3.7, well above its peers. The premium reflects investor confidence in its ability to deliver stable earnings. As usual, HDFC Bank met expectations on most counts in its June quarter earnings. Net profit rose 20.14% year-on-year, (y-o-y) backed by growth in its retail business. In the March quarter, net profit had risen 20.2%. Thats how consistent HDFC Banks profit growth has been.Net interest income (NII) grew 22% y-o-y. Surprisingly, the net interest margin (NIM), which had been expected to remain stable, rose sequentially to 4.4% in the quarter from 4.3%, aided by moderating deposit costs. Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) and net NPAs rose sequentially to 1.04% and 0.32% of the total loan book, respectively, because of defaults in the small and medium enterprises segment. Provisions for bad loans increased 19% y-o-y and 30.8% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q), in part due to funds set aside for loans to Punjab for food procurement. Analysts dont see the marginal rise in bad loans as a concern. Also, the spike seen in provisions is due to a one-off factor and one shouldnt read too much into it, they say. HDFC Banks current and savings account (CASA) ratio was stable y-o-y at 40%; although it was lower than the 43% seen in the March 2016 quarter. While the bank is making efforts to expand branches, pushing CASA to higher levels would be a challenge.

Helping the rebound is a strong product pipeline and the belief that these new products will offset potential weakness in the business environment in the coming season.
				   
				Bayer CropScience plans to register 20 new products by 2020, of which four are scheduled to be launched next fiscal year. One of its peers, PI Industries Ltd, is estimated to launch one-two products per annum in the domestic market and another, Dhanuka Agritech Ltd, two-three (exclusive) products, data from Edelweiss Securities Ltd shows.According to B&K Securities India Pvt. Ltd, Bayer is also planning to launch new trait rice seeds and a cotton hybrid. While last 10-15 years have been spent on strengthening distribution reach and connect with farmers, Bayer is now complementing it with a strong product pipeline, B&K Securities said in a note.The strong product pipeline can help cushion Bayer from the vagaries of agricultural demand. It gained market share in cotton seeds despite a drop in the industry volumes in the previous summer crop season (kharif). In agrochemicals, Bayer plans to capitalize on strong traction for herbicides through new molecules. According to Edelweiss, the company aims to increase the share of herbicides in revenue from the current 17% to 40% in 2020.The launches will complement six new products Bayer introduced over the last two years. Consistent new product launches supported by strong pipeline will continue to drive growth, Edelweiss said in a note. B&K Securities estimates the new products to contribute half of Bayers incremental growth by 2020. Currently the share of revenue generated from products introduced in the last five years stands at around 20%.While the product pipeline looks strong, the performance so far this fiscal year has been a dampener. Revenue dropped 10% in the last quarter. In the nine months to December, revenue is up just 2%. The performance was hit by external factors like weak demand and unfavourable climatic conditions.With the company enhancing its product portfolio, the performance in the coming season should be better than in the year gone by.

0.07,"Davos: Open markets and global trade have been blamed for job losses over the last decade, but global chief executive officers say the real culprits are increasingly machines.
				   
				And while business leaders gathered at the annual World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos relish the productivity gains technology can bring, they warned this week that the collateral damage to jobs needs to be addressed more seriously.From taxi drivers to healthcare professionals, technologies such as robotics, driverless cars, artificial intelligence and 3-D printing mean more and more types of jobs are at risk. Adidas, for example, aims to use 3-D printing in the manufacture of some running shoes.Jobs will be lost, jobs will evolve and this revolution is going to be ageless, its going to be classless and its going to affect everyone, said Meg Whitman, chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise.So while some supporters of Donald Trump and Brexit may hope new government policies will bring lost jobs back to Americas Rust Belt or Britains industrial north, economists estimate 86% of US manufacturing job losses are actually down to productivity, according to the WEFs annual risks report.Technology is the big issue and we dont acknowledge that, Mark Weinberger, chairman of consultancy EY, said on Thursday, arguing there was a tendency to always blame trading partners.The political backdrop is prompting CEOs to take more seriously the challenge of long-life training of workforces to keep up with the exponential growth of technological advances. I think what were reaching now is a time when we may have to find alternative careers through our lifetime, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella told Reuters. Over the last decade, more jobs have been lost to technology than any other factor, and John Drzik, head of global risk at insurance broker Marsh, expects more of the same. That is going to raise challenges, particularly given the political context, Drzik, who helped compile the WEF report, said.Compared to clamping down on immigration by tightening borders, dealing with the impact of technology destroying jobs is something that is perhaps even less easily controlled.For while many advanced technologies remain more expensive than low- or medium-skilled labour in the near term, the shift is likely to accelerate as costs come down.Widening gapTechnological advancements require governments, businesses and academic institutions to develop more educated and highly skilled workforces, executives in Davos said.But this shift to skilled workers also widens the income gap and fuels growing inequality.Jonas Prising, CEO of staffing firm ManpowerGroup, noted that US unemployment is only about 2 to 2.5% among college-educated people but 9 or 10 percent among those with low or no skills.The idea that we would ban automation as part of an evolution within the manufacturing industry, is not really part of the discussion, Prising said. He pointed to policies in countries like Denmark and Italy, where there is a focus on employability of workers.If we dont own responsibility (for the problem of displaced workers), its only going to get bigger, Procter & Gamble Chief Executive David Taylor said.Brawn and brainThe scope of the employment risk from what the WEF calls the fourth industrial revolution which blurs the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres is unclear.A University of Oxford study in 2013 said nearly half of US jobs were at risk, while in 2015 Forrester Research predicted a net loss of only 7% by 2025, as some lost jobs will be replaced with new ones. Forrester predicts that by 2019, one-quarter of all job tasks will be offloaded to software robots, physical robots, or customer self-service automation. Even the corner office may not be safe. CEOs feel reasonably confident we are not going to be replaced by artificial intelligence, Inga Beale, CEO of the Lloyds of London insurance market, said. But Im sure there will be a time! Reuters",2017-01-20,22gKFsmn9CELtWF1yh2pNO,"Technological advancements require govts, businesses and academic institutions to develop more educated and highly skilled workforces, say executives at Davos ",both,12:36,Impact of job-stealing robots a growing concern among global CEOs at Davos

The management also stated that revenue in overseas subsidiariesSamvardhana Motherson Reflectec and Samvardhana Motherson Peguformis steadily gaining traction in Europe, the US and even China.The company also maintained margins and consolidated operating profit rose 15% to Rs1,007 crore. The management attributed the flat margins to the product-mix in its sales during the quarter.Interestingly, in constant currency terms, the subsidiaries profitability was a tad better though still in single digits. These firms have come a long way in the last few quarters with a steady improvement in margins. On the other hand, the stand-alone entitys margin, although way higher than the overseas operations, was just at the year-ago level of 21%. Be that as it may, what fuelled the stock was news of a 50% reduction in net debt.

-0.13,"Indias shipping ministry did the right thing by scrapping the auction system for selling permits to stevedores and shore-handling agents on a revenue share model to operate at state-owned ports in a new policy unveiled last week.
				   
				The auction method of picking stevedores and shore-handling agents was introduced only in August last year. The revenue share had to be discovered through auction from within a ceiling rate allowed to be collected by stevedores and shore-handling agents from exporters and importers. The ceiling rate would be set by the Tariff Authority for Major Ports (TAMP), the rate regulator for the Union government ports.Consequently, the highest revenue share price determined through auction will have to be matched by all other eligible stevedores/shore-handling agents currently operating in these ports to be allowed to hold permits for work.Prior to August 2015, these entities bought permits from port authorities for a three-year period after paying a fee ranging from Rs.4,000 to Rs.1 lakh, depending on the port. On an average, there are at least 50-80 licensed stevedores operating at each of these ports.After issuing licences, the port authorities had no role to play in their functioning because the stevedores are engaged directly by the exporters and importers based on competitive rate quotations to load and unload cargo from non-public-private partnership (PPP) berths. They are paid by the exporters and importers who hire them but none of this money is shared with the port, which invests the money in constructing berths and erecting cargo-handling gear, by way of royalty or revenue share as in the case of PPP projects, triggering complaints that the ports were losing money because of the way the licences were sold. It also led to demands for selling permits on the basis of revenue share.The ministry soon realized that the auction model based on revenue share didnt fit into its goal of promoting competition, reducing cargo-handling costs and increasing revenue. For one, there was no motivation for bidders to quote a high revenue share when they always had the option to match the highest price bid and take a work permit.In an auction system like this, the licence should typically be given to the entity putting the highest price bid or a limited number of entities at the same rate. When there are no limits on the number of entities, why would somebody quote anything more than the reserve price?Suppose the government auction document says the minimum bid price is 2% of the ceiling rate, why would anybody quote even one paisa more than the 2% to get a licence? On the contrary, if the unsuccessful bidders decide not to match the highest bid or only some of them did, it would have led to a monopolistic situation, defeating the purpose of widening competition and reducing logistics costs.In the new policy, the ministry has asked each port to fix a cargo-wise royalty on a per-tonne basis to be charged from stevedores and shore-handling agents. Apart from bringing revenue to the port, the royalty can be used as a marketing tool to attract cargo by increasing or lowering the rates, keeping in view competition from neighbouring ports.However, where the ministry has erred is in setting uniform performance parameters for stevedores and shore-handling agents without creating the necessary infrastructure to help achieve them.Secondly, the ministry has said that the ceiling rates to be set by TAMP will be based on the normative approach, wherein the tariffs are worked out on the basis of certain defined criteria and assumptions on capital costs and operating expenses that are unrelated to the actual cost.There are at least 10 variables that affect performance when handling cargo from a conventional berth.For instance, coal unloading productivity varies for reasons such as depth and back-up area for storing cargo. Another key variable is the ship itself. The vessel could be geared (with cargo-handling gear on board) or gearless. If geared, then the variables depend on the capacity of the ship cranes, the age of the ship, the performance of the cranes, the capacity of the grabs, the quality of the grabs, the cycle time of the cranes and so on. Each of these will have a bearing on the productivity and, consequently, the operational costs.Besides, the plots allotted for storage could be near or far, may have a railway track on the way from ship to plot or may not.In some ports, railway lines run all over the place, holding up cargo-laden trucks when cargo trains pass, hurting performance.These factors will also determine costs. The cost of lease rent may vary from plot to plot.How will TAMP reconcile all these factors while setting normative rates? If TAMP resorts to averaging any of the above factors, the normative tariff fixed would not serve any real purpose.Currently, all Union government ports, some of whom are operating for many decades, are pursuing modernization of cargo-handling activities. Once the modernization is completed at all ports, dry bulk cargo will only be unloaded with harbour mobile cranes (HMCs) erected at the berths. The plots are being reorganized without much of a difference between them. When that happens, all the above factors become irrelevant and it would be able to fix meaningful normative tariffs.Suffice to say, the current performance norms vary drastically from berth to berth and from vessel to vessel.The unreasonable and impractical performance standards set by the ministry brings the spotlight on global consultants, whose recommendations formed the basis of the new policy.These consultants did not interact with stevedores and shore-handling agents, some of whom have decades of field experience, ahead of submitting their recommendations. They have only gathered past data from ports, applied fancy modern algorithms and proposed performance parameters and penalties for non-performance. The whole exercise will only lead to additional revenue to the port through collection of penalties and will not improve productivity. The consultants should have interacted with the stakeholders, understood the impediments and reasons for the present level of performance, suggested corrective measures and then set performance targets.Thats when experts bring real value to the table; not merely to set targets.Performance norms and penalties linked to non-compliance are used by most international ports to improve overall productivity of operations, according to the shipping ministry.A guideline for the calculation of performance norms for different commodities, taking into account the infrastructure available, is important for enabling ports to use performance norms as a key lever to drive productivity improvement across ports, it said.P. Manoj looks at trends in the shipping industry.",2016-07-08,2bnVXU9xqdpqjGCse4OYmL,"The shipping ministry has asked each port to fix a cargo-wise royalty on a per-tonne basis to be charged from stevedores and shore-handling agents

				The withdrawal of Rs500 and Rs1,000 denomination notes is expected to lead to a freeze in property transactions, significant cash flow issues, slower project approvals and softer prices.The move has led to considerable panic in the real estate sector that was already caught in a three-year-old slowdown. Transaction volumes are expected to come to a standstill, and developers are worried about short-term cash flows. Receivables from customers are likely to get delayed and cancellation of bookings may happen because buyers or investors may rethink as asset prices are likely to go down, said Rajeev Bairathi, executive director and head of capital markets at Knight Frank India.Cash forms a major component in most transactions in the real estate sector such as land purchases, procuring approvals from government departments or civic bodies, selling homes or plots of land and paying contractor and architect bills.To be sure, the initiative to eliminate black money aims to rid the real estate sector of corruption and lack of transparency but in the short term it is sure to add to the pain.Purchasing of land and all real estate transactions are going to be impacted. People used to park money in cash and cheque in a certain ratio, but there is going to be restriction on that, said Avneesh Sood, director, Eros Group, a Delhi-based realty firm. The number of people who want to purchase may drop and hence, sales may drastically drop. Property markets such as National Capital Region (NCR), which is mainly investor-driven and Tier II and III cities, where also cash plays a major role in transactions, are expected to be more impacted than others, property analysts said.NCR real estate developers would be the worst hit, followed by Mumbai and Bengaluru. Sales will go down dramatically and most may have to reduce prices, said a property analyst, who did not want to be named. In smaller property markets such as Surat, Ludhiana or Kochi, the difference between the Ready Reckoner rates and market value of property is wide, much more than say, Mumbai. Developers often tend to sell the properties based on the ready reckoner value, and charge the remaining amount in cash. Ready Reckoner rates are residential and commercial rates for a given area published every area by the state government. We suspect land deals will not happen for the next six months in the state. But most developers in the state have started streamlining their businesses and putting processes in place because of RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Act) which is being implemented, said Vijay Shah, promoter of Ahmedabad-based Vijay Builders Pvt.

Indiabulls Real Estate fell 18.51%, the steepest fall since 7 January 2009, to close at Rs65.60 a sharea level last seen on 28 April.Land deals had become speculative, because investors in residential diverted to land and office projects, when residential fared badly. The land economy thrives on cash and that is set to change. The move will also disrupt the smaller property markets, which also involve a lot of cash dealings. But in the long term, this will be a game changer for the sector, said Sanjay Dutt, chief executive, India operations, Ascendas-Singbridge India.Not just sales and prices, the cash network is deeply entrenched in the system through the approval process that every project has to go undergo.Rohit Poddar, managing director of Mumbai-based Poddar Developers Ltd said bureaucrats who take money in cash will face challenges. ...There might be a scenario where approvals may not happen on time. The maximum impact will be seen through land transactions and on the approval side, he said. In the long term, this is likely to bring more consolidation in the sector, where a large number of smaller, unorganized developers may cease to operate and the established firms may get stronger and hopefully, more transparent. Knight Franks Bairathi said foreign institutional funding in real estate will go up as a result, as risks concerning a parallel economy and cash transactions decrease.  Diwali sales were subdued under recessionary conditions, and business has dropped for many.

				The Ujjwala scheme of distributing clean cooking fuel to women in poor households launched in May by Modi is set to cross 1 crore connections this week, with states in the east, north-east and hilly regions being the biggest beneficiaries, a person involved in implementing the scheme said on condition of anonymity.Poll-bound Uttar Pradesh is the largest beneficiary state with 34 lakh poor women getting the connection, followed by states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Odisha.Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Jharkhand and the north-eastern states too have got priority status under the scheme with no cap on the number of connections to be issued. Members of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and minorities are the major beneficiaries of the scheme.Interestingly, while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had performed well in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar, the party wants to consolidate its position in states like Odisha and make further inroads into the north-east which together comprise 25 Lok Sabha seats. The BJP is in power in Assam. It also partners government in Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh. Similarly, West Bengal and Odisha remain crucial for the BJP because the two states together control 63 Lok Sabha seats.Jammu & Kashmir is also a priority area for the BJP where it had won seats in Jammu and Ladakh regions, while the party continued its dismal performance in the Kashmir valley where it drew a blank. The performance was repeated in December 2014 when BJP won seats in Jammu but didnt open an account in the Valley.The steps taken by the NDA is also crucial because the BJP leadership hopes to play a decisive role in the assembly elections in states like Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarkhand, Uttar Pradesh and north-eastern states in the next two years.States are given priority status if LPG use is less than the national average of 61% of households. Geographically and economically-challenged states received priority as LPG access has been less in those regions.Our target for the current financial year is 1.5 crore connections. We have already cleared applications more than that and are working towards releasing all of that shortly. In a day or two, we will cross the one crore mark, explained the person quoted above.To make sure that all the households that are given connections get easy refills, oil companies Indian Oil Corp.

Profit before certain items was $9.36 a share. Analysts on average expected sales of $20.6 billion and profit per-share of $9.63, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The earnings miss was mostly caused by a one-time tax payment that pushed the tax rate to 22% from a 5% rate a year earlier.

Executives said some of this went toward facilities and infrastructure, including computer servers and data centers to support the companys online advertising business and cloud services. This spending paid off. Googles Other revenue line, which includes cloud computing, jumped 62% to $3.4 billion. This segment also includes sales from its app store and hardware devices.On the conference call, Alphabet said more investment in cloud is coming this year.

The Vidhi paper enumerated important components of a robust data protection regime: entities required to comply with data protection norms; the kind of information to be protected; consent for collecting information; and the individuals right to access his or her information held by another organization.

But other income rose by a third from a year ago to Rs3,025 crore, boosting profit growth to a good extent.
				   
				In fact, the refining business was expected to perform well thanks to a better refining operating environment, as the Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) had improved sequentially. Sure, the companys GRM improved to $10.8 a barrel from $10.1 a barrel in the September quarter but fell short of the expectations of many analysts. For instance, Kotak Institutional Equities and Nomura Research were expecting the measure at $11.3 a barrel and $11.5 a barrel, respectively. RILs premium over benchmark Singapore GRM at $4.1 per barrel is also the lowest in the past three quarters.Even as the petrochemicals business performed well with its Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) increasing 30% from a year earlier, the fact that RILs key business segment hasnt performed as expected is disappointing. Refining business Ebit accounted for almost two-thirds of the companys total Ebit in the quarter. The domestic oil and gas business posted a loss at the Ebit level, due to lower price realizations and lower volumes. The organized retail business has performed well but the segment is relatively small to have a meaningful overall impact.What of the stock? The RIL stock has underperformed the benchmark Sensex index so far this fiscal year. But its worth noting that the share price has appreciated about 16% from its closing low of Rs930 seen on 23 May 2016. Currently, one RIL share trades at 11 times estimated earnings for the next fiscal year. The refining environment continues to remain strong but is already known to investors and may not be enough to override their other concerns.RILs outstanding debt has increased to Rs1,94,381 crore as on 31 December from Rs1,89,132 crore as on 30 September. During the same time frame, cash and cash equivalents declined to Rs76,339 crore from Rs82,533 crore. That could be a concern, according to independent analyst S.P. Tulsian, who said, I believe this is mostly on account of increase in telecom capex, a business from which there is no clarity on revenue or Ebitda from a near-term perspective. The market is not going to react positively due to concerns on negative cash flows and unimpressive profit growth of refining, its core and main business segment, says Tulsian. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.Of course, all eyes will be on the performance of the telecom business. The company has recently expressed confidence saying that it will prove the financial communitys scepticism wrong with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds performance. The year 2017 will see a test of this optimism as Jio turns into a paid service, said CLSA in a report on 2 January.This year will also see stabilization of RILs downstream projects. Analyst expectations of incremental Ebitda from these projects remain markedly below guidance of $3bn-3.5bn, points out CLSA. The low expectations give room for surprise to the upside, added the report. The stock thus is likely to take cues from a combination of telecom and downstream projects news flow, which is where investor attention will also be focused in fiscal year 2018.",2017-01-17,343YGLUtdxSMgy0SZVbXEM,Reliance Industriess GRM improved to $10.8 a barrel from $10.1 a barrel in the September quarter but fell short of the expectations of many analysts,competitor,00:36,RILs refining business fails to wow in Q3
-0.42,"Listed Indian banks have had their worst three quarters in history with these past nine months culminating in a massive drop of almost 30% in profit, a doubling of the bad loan pile and additional trouble of capital depletion for public sector banks. But have banks learnt their lesson? Have they wised up in the nine months and provided for every rupee they learnt had turned toxic?
				   
				The answer is not a straight and comforting yes. Two numbers indicate that banks could still be swimming naked in the bad loan pool. One is the provisions of banks towards bad loans and second is the provision coverage ratio (PCR). Of the 39 listed banks that have declared results for the September quarter (Jammu and Kashmir Bank is yet to release its numbers), 30 lenders saw their PCR drop sharply from a year ago. Axis Bank saw the biggest drop in the ratio to 59% in the September quarter from 78% a year ago. The worst of the lot were South Indian Bank and Punjab and Sind Bank, both having a ratio of just 46%.PCR is a measure of funds kept aside by a bank to cover bad loans. A higher PCR means the bank is protecting itself better against its bad loans. It is clear that lenders are yet to make the required prudent provisions against bad loans. This is frightening for the outlook on profitability for banks in the coming quarters. As bad loans age and more loans slip every quarter, provisions are unlikely to come down. If the momentum of provisioning remains the same, loss-making banks may not be able to swing to profit and those making profits are unlikely to increase the growth in their earnings. For the sector as a whole, provisions rose by 80% in the September quarter but the bad loan stockpile bloated by a greater 105% on a net basis. To avoid painting every bank with the same brush, provisions rose at a faster pace than bad loan accretion in 16 banks. Now, have investors taken note of the worsening coverage ratio? One look at the price-to-book value multiple of the 30 banks that saw a sharp drop in PCR shows that the Street is yet to completely wake up to this grim picture. These lenders havent seen a big erosion in their multiples. Fifteen of these lenders saw their share price rise over the last nine months, with nine of them climbing more than 5%.Unless banks buckle up, their profits dont stand a chance in the coming quarters.",2016-11-16,3u6Mc46CbHmTaLGgzugwqI,"For the sector as a whole, provisions rose by 80% in the September quarter but the bad loan stockpile bloated by a greater 105% on a net basis",both,07:49,Banking on three quarters and a prayer 
-0.46,"The peaceful outdoors section of The Village Shop, a café that faces a church in the Mumbai suburb of Bandra, is an odd place for Bunty Sajdeh to be this Saturday afternoon. As we speak, much of his mind is on other events, which are taking place in a far more hectic environment. Five of the players his talent management company, Cornerstone Sport & Entertainment, represents are playing a hard game of Test cricket against New Zealand in the sweltering Kanpur heat (which India won). 
				   
				Cornerstone, which Sajdeh founded in 2008, is now an agency that represents sportsmen exclusively; it manages Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Rohit Sharma, Murali Vijay and Umesh Yadav, all of whom are in the current Indian Test team, as well as Ishant Sharma, who is likely to be in it as soon as he is fully fit. But it is not as if he simply looks at who the most talked-about cricketers are and then tries to sign them up. We scout players when theyre young, says Sajdeh, 38. Its easy to look at Virat today and say hes a rock star, but I spotted him back during the 2008 Under-19 World Cup and signed him up before he became a regular for India. Sajdeh and his team are constantly tracking the Indian domestic circuit, looking for cricketers who display consistency in performance, but also confidence and flair in their personalities. When I first saw Virat, during an Under-19 match in Malaysia, he didnt actually get that many runs. But what struck me was the way he spoke confidently to everyone around him and took charge of situations. You have to have that bit of personality we can work on. You cant be a complete introvert, he says. Now, Cornerstone has young cricketers Shreyas Iyer, Manan Vohra, Mayank Dagar and Vijay Zol on its roster. The role of the player agent in Indian sport gained prominence in the 1990s, when Mark Mascarenhas ensured that Sachin Tendulkar was pasted on our television screens, making him one of the highest paid sportsmen in the world. Before the endorsements and corporate sponsorships start pouring in, however, you have to carefully craft a players image, turning him from someone people respect to someone whose lifestyle people crave, whose shoes, watch, jacket and soft drink of choice people will line up to buy.This is what Sajdeh wants to do, and he tells every player he meets that the process takes time. We signed Ajinkya three months ago, after six years of talking to him, he says. I told him that for the first six months, I am not going to push brands to seek his endorsement because right now he is someone who is known only for his cricket. There is a lot more to him, and we want to create a bit of edginess around his image and display that to the media in the coming months.A big part of building a players image these days is managing their interactions with fans on social media. Sajdeh admits he is not digitally savvy, but has a great social media team that manages players accounts, analysing data from Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to determine what kinds of posts excite people. Fans dont want to see photos of a player on the field. They want to know more about the player off the field. So we will send a team to a players home when he has a couple of days off and take photos of him with his pet, or his mum or him cooking something, and then release those images at appropriate times, he says. They always ask for the players approval before posting something, though, and let them word the post themselves. Fans are smart and can tell when someone has ghost-written something, Sajdeh explains. So detailed is his curation of his clients public personas that he even invests in styling them for public functions. If an athlete has to attend an awards function and I get him an Armani suit and a hair-cut from a professional stylist, it gives him confidence and changes the way he carries himself, which pays dividends in the end. It is rather ironic to listen to Sajdeh talk about expensive suits, as he readily admits he rarely wears them. He showed up for our meeting in black  jeans and a blue T-shirt. And even this, he says, is more colour than you will usually see on him. My standard work and evening attire is the same: a white or black T-shirt with jeans. I work long hours every day and need to be comfortable. But he is not embarrassed about his personal style, maintaining that even simple attire can become a talking point when worn with confidence, something he keeps telling the players he represents. His aversion to keeping up with fashion trends is actually what got him into talent management. After completing his bachelors in commerce from the HR College of Commerce and Economics in Mumbai, he worked in his familys garment business, but found it tedious and uninspiring. His sisters husband, actor Sohail Khan, ran GS Worldwide Entertainment, a company that does everything from producing films to organizing events to representing film and sports personalities. A people-person, Sajdeh joined the firm as a production assistant and enjoyed doing a job that had personal relationships at its core. After two years with GS Entertainment, he joined Percept Ltd, forming a close relationship with cricketer Yuvraj Singh, whom the company managed. It was Singh and actor Sushmita Sen, another of Sajdehs clients, who encouraged him to start his own business. And, after a three-year stint at Globosport, he woke up one morning and decided to just do it. In 2009, Singh introduced him to Kohli. The Indian Premier League was being held in South Africa that year, and I was in Johannesburg doing some work for Yuvrajs foundation, Sajdeh recalls. We were at a restaurant, and Virat came in wearing a flashy jacket and sunglasses. I remember thinking, What are you doing? Youre an athlete, not a model.Kohli only spoke to Sajdeh for around 10 seconds, but by the next year they were working together. At that stage, Cornerstone was managing film personalities as well as sportsmen, but Sajdeh wanted to focus on the latter. To be honest, even though I have a lot of friends and family from the film world, I dont think I have watched a movie in five years, he says. I realized that most of my team was more interested in sport than anything else too, so I thought, why dont we focus exclusively on it? It was also a space that none of the other firms were in. Apart from cricketers, Sajdeh has also signed up motorsport racer Jehan Daruvala, body builder Miihier Singh and footballer Sunil Chhetri. Football is actually his favourite sport, and Manchester United his favourite team. Over the years, Sajdeh has formed a close personal bond with the players he manages. Some of those friendships have ended in hurt, he admits. But you cant help getting close to the players as ours is a relationships business. A lot of the athletes treat him like an elder brother, asking for advice on what car or house to buy or what to do when they are having girl problems. When work is over, we all chill together. They treat me not like an agent, but like family.",2016-09-30,4EO0N4JSOErNtaof7qMilN,"The founder of Cornerstone Sport & Entertainment and the man behind brand Virat Kohli, on the slow process of crafting a sportsmans image

-0.57,"Reacting to the railway budget, one industry stakeholder told a business news channel that he was happy with the announcements as long as he didnt think about how they would be funded. That aptly sums up the mood on the Street, which dumped railway-related stocks after the budget was presented.The highlight, of course, is the scaling up of capital expenditure (capex) to Rs.1.2 trillion for the next fiscal year, which is entirely commendable. But believing the big numbers requires a leap of faith.First, the targets set for the current fiscal year are seeing sharp cuts. Capex for the current year has been revised down from around Rs.1 trillion to Rs.82,192 crore. To be sure, thats far higher than what the railways has been clocking for years. But as of December, the national transporter spent only 64% of the revised capex target, an increase of less than one-fourth from the year-ago period.The second problem is resource generation. After meeting all expenditure, Indian Railways is estimated to generate net revenue of Rs.18,210 crore in the next fiscal year. It is not only 8% less than the current fiscal years revised estimate (which itself has been cut) but is also prone to serious downward revisions.Total traffic receipts (both from freight and passenger fares) are estimated to rise 10%, optimistic considering the lack of upward revision of tariffs. As in the previous budget, the ministry is projecting a double-digit (12%) growth in passenger earnings, when the number of passengers is actually declining. The expected fall is 1.5% in the current fiscal year. This year, passenger revenue is expected to go up by 7%. True, freight revenue growth projections are realistic at 5%. But lack of time-bound measures to revive the flagging volumesestimated to grow just 1% in the current fiscal yearhas been a disappointment.Of course, a significant part of the Plan expenditure is funded by support from the Union budget, borrowings and institutional finance. But as Religare Capital Markets Ltd points out, resources from all these sources have fallen short of budget estimates. If economic activity does not see a meaningful recovery and the governments fiscal position remains stretched, then it is likely the budgetary support for next fiscal year will also be constrained.The railways plans to further lower costs and boost non-traffic revenue. While the ministry has achieved some success in cost-control measures, non-traffic revenue is showing no signs of improvement yetin fact, it is expected to fall 8% this year.All this gives way to some doubts about the budget estimates. The poor performance in FY16 has few excuses, unless the projections for FY16 were too ambitious to begin with, Religare Capital Markets wrote in a note. One cannot help but be sceptical of FY17 projections, therefore, especially on the funding part of the planned expenditure.However, there is no denying that the railways capex is growing. As Dilip Bhat, joint managing director at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd, points out, even if the railways manages to achieve capex of Rs.1 trillion next fiscal year, it will be a significant improvement from the Rs.40,000-60,000 crore the organization was spending some years back.While that is a clear indication of the governments push to kick-start growth through increased public investments, the fact remains that the numbers need to be taken with a pinch of salt.",2016-02-26,4K3Wxb6Muf9pmFztI6WoqM,"The highlight of railways budget is the scaling up of capital expenditure to Rs1.2 trillion for the next fiscal year, which is commendable, but believing the big numbers requires a leap of faith

				Australia, Qatar and Iran could all act as potential suppliers of long-term LNG contracts, power minister Piyush Goyal said in Sydney on Thursday. The global search for LNG comes as Indias gas-fired plants, which can generate nearly 25 gigawatts of power, run at less than a quarter of their capacity because of a shortage of the fuel at affordable prices.I think gas needs to be between $5 and $5.50 landed at my power plant. That is what Im looking for in the medium- to long-term, Goyal said in an interview. Otherwise I wont be able to start those gas plants.NTPC Ltd., Indias biggest power producer, is said to be seeking to terminate a long-term supply contract for LNG because the fuel is too expensive to be used in power generation. That highlights the countrys difficulty in switching from coal to natural gas for power generation, undermining Prime Minister Narendra Modis efforts to cut carbon emissions and promote clean energy.As of now I dont have any credible offer on the table but Im fairly confident from talking to people across the world that if not Australia, maybe Qatar will give it to me, or Iran might be able to get me something, Goyal said. Ill go to Europe next week to discuss the same thing. I am sure Ill find a seller.Spot LNG in Singapore rose to $6.542 per million British thermal units this week, the highest since December, according to the Singapore Exchange Ltd. Prices are up more than 65% from a low in April.Australia investmentsIndia is also targeting investments in Australian LNG projects and coking coal mines to secure fresh sources of supply, Goyal said.We could buy stakes, we could buy the whole LNG plant itself, we could look at coal mines, Goyal said.Petronet LNG Ltd., Indias biggest LNG importer, signed a pact with Exxon Mobil Corp. in 2009 for supply of 1.5 million tons of the super-chilled fuel for 20 years from the Gorgon LNG project in Australia. Supplies are expected to begin next month.Goyal also expects Indian companies to boost their investments in Australia despite delays to Adani Enterprises Ltd.s Carmichael mine in Queensland, which was hampered by environmental protests.

-1.0,"Inventory gains were the flavour of the season for refining firms. 
				   
				The Singapore complex gross refining margin (GRM), a measure of the difference between the per-barrel price of crude and the value of products distilled from it, dropped to $5 a barrel in the June quarter, compared with $7.7 a barrel in the March quarter. Still, the reported GRMs of Indian refining firms on a sequential basis fared better. However, these GRMs got a boost on account of inventory gains, thanks to the rising oil price trend over the quarter.Adjusted for refining inventory gains, the GRMs of oil marketing companies (OMCs) were in the range of $4-5 a barrel, according to Spark Capital Advisors (India) Pvt. Ltd. OMCs include Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC). OMCs results beat Street expectations. IOCs operating profit increased by one-third, compared with last years June quarter. HPCLs operating profit rose 17% year-on-year, while BPCLs operating profit increased at a much slower pace of 3%.GRM is a measure of profitability.Reliance Industries Ltds (RIL) reported premium of $6.5 per barrel over Singapore GRM was the highest in the past eight years, according to the firm, and exceeded Street estimates by a good margin. Most analysts expected RILs GRM to be $9.5-10 per barrel. But RILs GRM came in at $11.5 per barrel. The management indicated $2 per barrel can be attributed to gains from inventory, hedging and risk management. RILs stand-alone revenue fell 19%, reflecting the decline in the broader crude oil prices, while net profit rose about 19%. That was because of a 628 basis points jump in operating profit margin, a 3% decline in depreciation cost and an 18.5% rise in other income. A basis point is 0.01%.Meanwhile, oil producers have had it tough what with oil prices languishing. As expected, net price realization of Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd and Oil India Ltd declined 22% and 25% year-on-year, respectively.Oil marketing stocks have outperformed the Sensex so far this fiscal, while RIL stock has underperformed. However, RIL shares have performed well after the announcement of the imminent commercial launch of services by its telecom unit at its annual general meeting in early September.

So while Mistry has suggested the groups pursuit of a small car for the Indian middle class was no more than a personal fancy of Tata and should be wound up, the accusation never extended to how the man who ran the group for over 20 years went and splurged on a gold plated Rolls Royce for himself. 
				   
				Indeed, till the time Tata Motors Ltd bought Jaguar Land Rover, the group owner would often squeeze himself into one of the more plebian cars the company made.In truth, most of Indias company owners and founders have conservative lifestyles with few of the wild and exotic indulgences that we associate with the billionaire lifestyle across the world. Sample this: in January 2014, the Dallas Safari Club, a hunters rights organization, auctioned off a permit which would allow the holder to travel to Namibia for the chance to kill one of only 5,000 surviving black rhinos. The auction was won by oil heir and Texas hunter Corey Knowlton, who bid $350,000 for that dubious right.It isnt the kind of thing that Tata or Kumar Mangalam Birla or Mukesh Ambani, or a dozen other Indian tycoons are likely to be doing on their summer breaks. Despite their obvious wealth, their sensibilities seem no different from that of many well-brought-up middle-class Indians of an earlier era. That shows even in the way most behave with people around them. Thus, Tata will often hold the elevator door open at Bombay House when he sees an executive rushing towards it and by all accounts Mistry is a chip off the same block.Dilip Shanghvi, founder of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and the countrys richest billionaire by some rankings, is low-key to a fault. Fortis Healthcare Ltd co-founders Malvinder and Shivinder Singh may be in the best-dressed lists of social magazines, but you are unlikely to find Prathap Reddy, founder of Apollo Hospitals or Y.K. Hamied, chairman of Cipla Ltd, displaying any sartorial vanities.Most of them dress simply, wearing suits only for meetings and even those tend to be the kind that will hardly attract attention. Tata, in fact, seems to have dropped his jacket of late, appearing in his shirt sleeves at most of the acrimonious annual general meetings of his group companies over the last few months. Clearly they are not following the example of UK-based billionaire Scott Alexander, dubbed the Vainest Man in Britain, who likes to buy out entire clothes collections, rather than just certain pieces. One year he spent £300,000 on clothes from Dolce & Gabbana.At meetings to discuss strategic plans for his group, Ajay Piramal munches on such frugal fare as khakra while Reliance Industries Ltd chairman Mukesh Ambanis fondness for vada paav is legendary. Contrast their gastronomical conservatism with that of Sean Parker, co-founder of Napster, who is known to have spent $13,000 on a single meal.Indias IT billionaires are of course in a class of their own in terms of frugality. Azim Premji, once Indias richest man, whose stake in Wipro Ltd. is worth nearly $15 billion, would often take an auto rickshaw from the old airport in Bengaluru and once threw a mini fit when he was automatically upgraded from his regular economy class seat on a Kingfisher flight to Delhi.The others, Infosys founders N.R. Narayana Murthy, Nandan Nilekani and the reclusive Shiv Nadar who set up HCL Technologies Ltd, are no different. The latters one indulgence is his Zen garden, on which he showers attentions. How utterly boring, when compared to Australian billionaire Clive Palmer, who got himself a $600 million replica of the Titanic, or another billionaire who recently ordered a diamond and gold encrusted collar for his pet dog.Of course, Indias billionaire class has its honourable exceptions and the latest gizmo or car eventually does find its way to Indian shores.

				Carlsen, who relies heavily on specialised chess computers for his preparation, was worried that Russian hackers would gain access to his tactics which, in turn, could help Crimean-born Karjakin, reported The Indian Express. His fears stemmed from precedence: Russia-based hackers had broken into the World Anti-Doping Agencys website sometime back.Technology is now integral to sportand not just in malpractices like the one cited above (Carlsen retained his title). Technology is used in training, diet, recovery, clothes, shoes and in every sphere of the modern sporting world. In speed skating, an academic paper World Records: How much athlete? How much technology? suggests that half of the progress of world records has been due to changes in technologyand the other half from real athletic improvement.Three key areas have been consistently in prominence: first, the use of technology in officiating or umpiring; second, in data analysis; and third, in safety. All three play a role in driving sporting excellence and, more importantly, particularly in the world of sport, driving fans experience. It can be argued that too much reliance on science or numbers removes the element of instinct from sportone which allows M.S. Dhoni to promote himself in a World Cup cricket final or tells Stan Wawrinka to hit that backhand in the 2015 French Open tennis final. But when millimetres and fractions of seconds decide the difference between winner and runner-up, any help becomes welcome in the high intensity, competitive world of modern sport. Heres a look at how technology makes a mark in these three facets of sport.Not just line callsIn the first Test match against England in November, India were 208-1 with Cheteshwar Pujara batting on 86 when a ball bowled by Zafar Ansari hit the batsman on his leg. The umpire gave him out but Pujara, playing at home in Rajkot, asked for a review.The reconsideration decided the ball was going over the stumps and the umpires decision was revised. As the crowd roared, Pujaras wife did a little jig in the stands and two men sitting across Pujaras father shook hands, the commentator paid due credit: Thank you ICC and DRS.The Board of Control for Cricket in India has for long opposed the decision review system (DRS), citing inaccuracies in its methodology, but agreed to it on a trial basis for the five-Test series. But if a replay benefited Pujara (he went on to score a century in the first innings) it has benefited several others, too.Video replays have been used in many sports besides crickettennis, rugby, baseball and basketball, to name a fewfor different purposes. In basketball, it can be used to find out if the shot was released before the final buzzer, in baseball to handle boundary calls and in tennis/badminton whether the ball/shuttle landed inside or outside the lines. British firm Hawk-Eye, which has developed systems for many sports, uses 6-7 cameras to record the balls trajectory in tennis and puts together a three-dimensional image for officials to decide if the ball is in.Footballs governing body FIFA tried GoalControl technology during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The German-produced tech used 14 high-speed cameras and sensors mounted around the stadiumseven pointed at each goalto detect whether the ball has crossed the goal line or not. They could also combine their data into a three-dimensional format and send visual or vibration signals to the referees watch. A British firm Small Fry developed shin guards equipped with accelerometers and magnetic sensors that could reduce the number of dives in a football match. This could rob the sleep of players such as Chelseas Diego Costa.The Guardian reported other similar tools sometime back: Cairos Technologies and Adidas producing a system that uses a magnetic field to track the ball using a sensor embedded inside the ball, which detects the magnetic field produced by thin wires underneath the penalty box. Goalminder technology uses high-speed cameras built into the goal posts and crossbar to deliver visual evidence; GoalRef uses a magnetic field-based technology, too, but here the goal frame detects the passing of the ball.The International Football Association Board (IFAB) also approved testing of video technology to aid match officials (a final decision is to be taken later). The trials will allow referees to call on video assistance to help determine four categories of game-changing moments: goals scored, red cards, penalties and mistaken identity, AFP reported in March.In international sport, the stakes are very high. For instance, in the Olympics that are held once in four years, an athlete may not get a second shot at it since sporting careers tend to be brief, making margins of errors career-defining.So when Bahamas Shaunae Miller divedor fell as some have arguedat the end of the womens 400-metre race at the Rio Olympic Games in August, she lay on the track breathless for some time, as the result of the race remained unclear. It emerged later that she had beaten the favourite, Allyson Felix of the USA, to win the gold medal. The margin of victory: 0.07 seconds. The decision made by: Technology.Numbers tell how good you areOne of the best examples of using data comes from baseball, in which Oakland Athletics manager Billy Beane partnered a Yale graduate in crunching numbers and building a low-budget team of winnersimmortalized in the book Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game and a Hollywood movie. That was over a decade ago.Since then, innovations like Major League Baseballs Statcast and the National Basketball Associations SportVU systemsa system of six cameras in each arena that measures the movements of the ball and every player on the court, generating an entire database of performance informationhave leveraged data to assist coaches and players. Teams in the National Basketball Association, such as the San Antonio Spurs, have similarly used Big Data sets to help owners and coaches recruit players and execute game plans, according to the Stanford Graduate School of Business.A hand-held device called Skulpt helps improve trainingits 12 sensors, when pressed against the skin, create electric current that measures the percentage of muscle fibre versus fat stored inside the muscle. EliteForm is a technology that tracks and analyses an athletes movements while training and during games, the CNN listed in February.Niall Clark, who is the head of performance at Sachin Tendulkar co-owned Kerala Blasters, the football team in the Indian Super League, says they rely heavily on heart rate monitors and GPS. The players are given intense amount of work on certain days so they can hit specific heart rate zones and 60-70% of their individual heart rate for a maximum of 20 minutesfor recovery of homeostasis balance. GPS helps find out how much distance a player has covered, sprints he has made, accelerations and decelerationdata that help find out how the hamstring is working.GPS has also helped find that midfielders, for example, travel farther but accelerated less than players in other positions. If there is a big jump from one to other morning in the resting heart rate, we know something is wrong. Saliva helps with hormone levels, blood levels, to gauge player fitness. We havent had any muscle injuries in the season; contact injuriesyou cannot do anything about, says Clark.In certain other places, filming an athlete to gauge form and errors is passé now. Newer three-dimensional motion capture technologylike the Xbox Kinect systemsand biometric feedback on heart and respiratory rates, can give far more information, SportTechie reported.Another device, Motionize, that sends real-time information directly to an app, is a virtual coach for canoeists and kayakers. It uses two sensors, one on the boat and one on the paddle, and displays a complete view of the athletes movements on the cellphone screen.Cricket, a sport heavily influenced by statistics and datafor both performers and fansis not far behind either. Firms like CricHQwhich has the expertise of former New Zealand cricketers Stephen Fleming and Brendon McCullumCricket 21 and SportsMechanics, a sports analytics firm, crunch numbers for teams.CricHQ, which is working in conjunction with Callaghan Innovation to build the worlds best match projection engine, claims to be able to predict with a confidence interval of approximately 75% the result of any fixture in the IPL (using previous IPL data). Confidence interval is a range in which a measurement or trial falls corresponding to a given probability. We are looking to expose this engine for the 2017 IPL and hope to provide a unique experience for customers and consumers alike, says David Robertson, the companys chief data officer.Wear it, bear it for safetyIn November 2014, Australian cricketer Phil Hughes was struck by a ball on the back of his neck while batting during a first-class game. He collapsed on the pitch and died two days later. But strange as that incident may seem, it was not isolated.In recent times, at least three other people have succumbed to injuries on the cricket field: in November the same year, an Israeli umpire died after being struck on the jaw by a ball; in April 2015 a 20-year-old club cricketer died after colliding with another player in Kolkata and in July, another in England died after being struck on the chest while batting. International cricketers like Joe Root, Craig Kieswetter and Stuart Broad have suffered impact injuries in recent times, highlighting the need for on-field safety. During the same Rajkot Test, Pujara was struck thrice on his helmet.The ill-effect of force is not uniqueauthor Jeanne Marie Laskas wrote about a pathologist, Dr Bennet Omalu, who discovered that American footballers could suffer from mental deterioration caused by blows to the head. It was made into a movie last year, Concussion.NFL moved on to smart helmets, which have sensor and magnet technologysensors detect and disperse the force of collisions, while the magnet will help by spreading and absorbing the force.Since the Hughes incident and even before that, cricket has taken corrective measures, as the International Cricket Council brought in new regulations. Helmets now have a stem guard, made of thermoplastic polyurethane, to shield the back of the head and neck. It is a clip-on attachment to the side of the grille, with enhanced impact absorption, reported espncricinfo.com early this year.Over the years, other sports have modified their methods for the sake of safer practices. For example, the centre of gravity of javelins was changed to ensure they remained within existing boundaries. Amateur boxers have had to wear headgears for protection.Physiotherapist John Gloster explains how biomechanical analysis is important to correct bowling action, thereby preventing injuries. With super slow-motion, one can analyse the forces acting on the spine. Biomechanical analysis, motion analysis systems, data analysis, running analysis all of them allow to make athletes more efficient, says Gloster, who has worked with the Indian cricket team in the past and is currently the sports technical advisor for KOOH, a sports education and technology company. He also stresses the importance of sleep as a predictor and preventer of injuries. He can monitor the profile of the athlete, over the week, to predict injury. Gloster uses a hand-held dynamometer to measure muscle force and ensure the athlete has the right amount in balance with other muscles. Gloster and KOOH also work with children on fitness.

Ltd and Castrol India Ltd before launching Foxymoron, a digital advertising agency, along with three partners. Currently, the eight-year-old independent agency services 85 brands, including Maybelline New York India, NYX Professional Makeup India, Fosters India, Jim Beam India, Red FM and Asian Paints, among others. In an interview, Gupta talks about  leveraging technology and challenges that plague digital advertising. Edited excerpts:  
How are you using technology to offer  solutions to brands?

We have created a creative technology arm called Phosphene which will approach digital advertising through a healthy mix of creative, technology and media. The future-ready agency of tomorrow will have to hit all these aspects. Here, technology means using augmented reality, virtual reality or creating integrated videos where users can decide their own stories. So far, we have only hired two resources for this arm who have studied creative technology globally. They have been meeting clients and informing them about the new arm.While some of the campaigns we do are pure play digital, all activations will be backed by creative technology. It gives us an edge over others which will eventually affect our top and bottom lines.We will also launch a technology driven video studio which will create a lot of interesting video content for brands which will be promoted on social media platforms.Does social media become restrictive after a point for brands?
Not at all. The problem with most brands is that they look at social media in its entirety. I believe if a brand can break its business objectives, each of it can be solved using different social media platforms. Having said that, social media is one of the touch points of digital. It is high time that brands look at digital strategies instead of equating social with digital.Can digital create brands on its own?
If you are looking at creating mass brands, then it cant. But there are certain brands which have been built on digital-first strategy. Maybelline, for instance, has been spending a huge chunk of its ad money on digital for the last five years. This includes using Facebook (canvas, live, photos), crowdsourcing songs digitally, Twitter, Instagram. It has Indias biggest Snapchat community.But brands need to be on digital consistently, which will create a persona. It is a much harder medium because one needs to be agile. The biggest challenge we face is making brands understand that they cant put out the same campaigns every year.Soon, there will no mainline or digital agency; there will be just a creative agency. Instead of digital or television, brands need to start think about audio-visual form of communication. So, first, a piece of content will be created and given the business problem and the target audience, the platform will be chosen.What are your revenue targets?
We do a top line billing of Rs50-55 crore and we aim to take it to Rs 150-200 crore by 2019.What are the challenges that digital advertising faces today?
Education is the biggest challenge both on the client and agency side. Facebook, for instance, has changed its algorithm three times and most of the people dont know what implications it has on the brands. The biggest problem is that digital has no entry barriersanybody with a laptop and a broadband connect is a digital agency now. Once these shops pass on clients to other agencies, they hate the concept of a digital agency. There is no trust and when such clients come to us, we have to work with them from scratch.There are a few companies which are digitally aware and doing fantastic work online but that is just 2% of the entire crop. Apart from education, we definitely need an industry body for digital advertising. All the bodies that are created in this country are for awards which is the biggest sham and that is why we never participate. Besides, there is dearth of talent which is why agencies pay huge salaries to retain their employees while clients digital budgets continue to be small which leads to a mismatch in the cash flows. If we dont get supply of the right talent, digital agencies will start to shut because currently, the business model is not financially viable.How do you fix this?

The clients have to start paying but lets accept it, we are in India which has a rat syndrome.

The business has been renamed Clix Capital. In an interview, Bhasin talks about the gameplan ahead. Edited excerpts:
Whats your view on the current scenario of demonetisation? Will it be beneficial for lenders?Its a real concern for the short term as growth will slow down, borrowing will slow down and payments will slow down. We are fortunate as we are not fully in the game yet. I can see shops being hurt, consumer sales dip, which no one could be prepared for. The next couple of quarters might be really painful. However, it will allow everyone to participate in the economy in the medium and long term and the entire push towards digitization will be very good for us and the economy. Ultimately, it could also drive cultural change against black money and really double and treble the taxpayer base. The overall long-term result could be very positive.If you look around the world, India is one of the most attractive places to do business anywhere in the world, and especially in financial services, the growth prospects are goodas long as we remain disciplined about risk management.You closed the GE Capital India buyout recently. What are the growth plans?We closed the acquisition two months ago. We have assets of $300 million which will be used as a base to expand business. We have identified three major segments for businessconsumer, SME (small and medium enterprise) lending and commercial/corporate lending. Within that, there are multiple segmentsconsumer durables, used car loans, personal loans, education loans, school loansin the consumer space. We may plan housing finance in future. The size of lending could be anywhere between Rs10,000 to Rs50-70 crore depending on the segment. Our firm was renamed as Clix Capital a month ago and all regulatory approvals are in place.What role do you expect to play in the area of technology where you have expertise as the founder of Genpact?We strongly believe that technology platforms, especially those focused on mobile technology, will be a key differentiator for us. We will also add very strong analytical capability, leveraging my prior experience as the founder of Genpact, where we built one of the largest analytics capabilities in India. While there are many fintech companies that are coming up, many struggle because of lack of funding and strong underwriting capabilities. We still have separate worlds between banks and financial services companies, many of whom are carrying legacy systems, and technology companies which are trying to go beyond just their technology platform.At Clix, we want to build the best hybrid financial and technology solution to take our products to customers in a unique manner, which delivers speed, convenience, backed by strong underwriting.Acquisitions are common in the non-banking financial company spaceseveral smaller buyouts took place recently.We will certainly expand business through acquisitionswhether loan portfolios, or smaller NBFCs or aggregating platforms. There are many interesting opportunities and platforms and we would keep looking and evaluating options. Right now, we want to focus most on building our businesses. Our major challenge is hiring talented people. We want to build a fantastic team, taking the best of GE and adding modern-day innovation and creativity and design thinking.What are the challenges for NBFCs in India?NBFCs have grown fast. High-quality companies have grown and opportunities in India are large. We have great success stories. The way wealth has been created, for example, in Kotak Bank, Bajaj, Induslnd and other private banks, is a fantastic story. Having said that, risk management remains a key issue.In future, we will see competition from Amazon, Paytm and many other non-traditional players in this lending space.

0.55,"Singapore: This weeks putsch at Tata Sons has already served one useful purpose. While its been clear for a while that something wasnt quite right at the $100 billion Indian empire, the chairmans surprise ouster has made it possible to start asking questions about strategy (or lack of it) at a conglomerate that traces its roots to the American civil war.
				   
				Did the newly dumped Cyrus Mistry fail to plant enough saplings of growth? Or did Ratan Tata, who gave Mistry the job only to take it back four years later, not want to face reality? Are some of the businesses he acquired now covered in weeds, compelling Mistry to trim the outgrowth of debt?The answers will be important for investors in the groups publicly traded units, who, at present, have no idea how the coup at the holding company will affect them.Letting Tata vs. Mistry play out in public is a delicious idea. With the Economic Times leaking the contents of an unhappy email purportedly written by Mistry to the Tata Sons board and owners, and at least one of those shareholders giving a TV interview on what they disliked about the Mistry regime, the slugfest has begun. Its time to pour a cup of (Tata-owned) Tetley tea, and settle down.Also Read: Tata Sons dividend payout steady for last decadeV.R. Mehta, a trustee at one of the philanthropic organizations that collectively own roughly two-thirds of Tata Sons, is right to argue that under Mistry, the dividends from group companies have become increasingly reliant on just two businesses  Jaguar Land Rover, one of Ratan Tatas most audacious acquisitions, and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., the software export unit.But to what extent is Mistry responsible? In the letter attributed to him by the Economic Times, the ousted chairman claimed that it was Ratan Tatas 2009 decision to buy a property in suburban Mumbai  in disuse since a 1993 bomb attack  that led to Indian Hotels Co.s entire net worth getting wiped out. The companys last big profit, of $115 million, was in 2008.Then again, a year after Ratan Tata bought Corus Group Plc in 2006, Tata Steel went on to earn an annual profit of almost $3 billion. A China-led global steel glut has turned that profit into a loss of $1 billion over the past four quarters, with Mistry warning in his letter of a potential $10 billion impairment of European steel assets.Tata Steels loss in past 4 quartersMistry cant shift all the blame to his predecessor. While Ratan Tatas non-JLR car investments have mostly flopped, Mistrys problem was not having enough big ideas of his own. He may not have been the one to sink the wireless telecom unit, but he did precious little to revive it. He could also have handled the ugly spat with NTT Docomo Inc., the partner in that business, a lot better.Also Read: Ratan Tata seeks to rally group firms after Cyrus Mistry ousterThe Tata Group has survived two world wars, nationalization of its prized airline by a socialist-minded government and other tribulations. But the damage to the groups reputation for fair dealing is probably Mistrys biggest failing as chairman.That failure has consequences. In Singapore, bond investors are scratching their heads over a dollar-denominated perpetual bond issue by Tata International Ltd. The debt of this thinly capitalized company will derive its value from implicit support by the Tata group. A few years ago, it would have been preposterous to suggest that the Tatas would stake their reputation to save $1.17 billion  the amount the group is seeking to avoid paying in the Docomo dispute. Its worrisome if investors are no longer sure whether the group will even back a $150 million to $200 million bond issue. A no-holds-barred airing of differences between Mistry and Ratan Tata may help reestablish just what it is that shareholders of Tata Sons want their group to stand for. That will be the cherry on the cake from this entertaining spectacle  to be washed down with that Tetley tea, of course.

-0.66,"New Delhi: The fine print of Union budget 2017-18 has served incentives for the energy sector such as lowering the tax burden on carbon trading gains and making it more attractive for foreign oil firms to store crude oil in Indias strategic reserves. 
				   
				The incentives seek to support energy security and climate change goals of the country after having decisively departed from petroleum subsidies.Union finance minister Arun Jaitley has proposed to cut the tax on gains from carbon trading to 10% from 30% in a move expected to make investments into energy efficiency and clean energy more rewarding. The minister also extended the income tax exemption to foreign companies storing crude oil in Indias strategic reserves to any gains from sale of such oil even after expiry of the companys contract with the Indian government. At the moment, this benefit is limited only during the contract period.The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) set up under the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) allows investors in emission-reducing projects to generate tradable credits corresponding to the volume of emission reduction achieved. These credits can be sold to industrialized countries. So far, the income tax department has been treating the income on transfer of carbon credits as business income, subject to a 30% tax. Jaitley has proposed that it shall be a concessional 10% and applicable surcharge and cess. This amendment will take effect from the 2017-18 financial year.The move to incentivize clean energy projects comes parallelly with gradual increase in taxes on petroleum products and the cess on coal, making India one of the leaders in climate change action. Since June 2014, when international oil prices started declining, India has increased excise duty on branded petrol from Rs15.5 a litre to Rs22.7 a litre as of December 2016 and on branded diesel from Rs5.8 a litre to Rs19.7 a litre, pointed out the Economic Survey 2016-17.In contrast, the governments of most advanced countries have simply passed on the benefits to consumers, setting back the cause of curbing climate change. As a result, India now outperforms all the countries except those in Europe in terms of tax on petroleum and diesel, the survey pointed out.Ashish Khanna, chief executive officer of Tata Power Solar Systems Ltd, said the budget demonstrated the governments commitment to being a front runner in renewable sources of energy.In line with the governments stated objective of phasing out corporate tax exemptions in order to be able to moderate the corporate tax rate from 30% to 25%, Jaitley did not extend the income tax incentive for power projects under section 80 IA after it expires on 31 March 2017. Those who complete power projects before this deadline will, however, be able to claim full deduction of income from the project while calculating the companys taxable income for 10 years.",2017-02-02,54hs1Tu1BnOPwTRwjFxHIK,The incentives seek to support energy security and climate change goals of the country,both,12:48,Budget 2017: Income tax break for carbon trading and strategic oil reserves
-0.54,"There is something about magical realism that appeals to our innermost human emotions. Literature has many examples where magical elements exist as part of the real world. Consider the ordinary wooden cupboard which opens up to Narnia in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; or platform 9¾ of Londons Kings Cross station, the secret entrance to board a train to Hogwarts in the Harry Potter series; or the town of Macondo in One Hundred Years of Solitude, where the surreal is the normal.
				   
				The success of Pokémon Go is also in the realm of magical realismas augmented reality brings magical pocket monsters to our real world.It is no secret that the Pokémon Go craze has swept across the world. It has players in the US, Australia, New Zealand and major parts of Europe hooked. Terms such as PokéStops, Pokémon gyms and Pokéballs have already become common parlance.The first home video game consolea device that outputs a video signal or visual image to display a video gamewas manufactured as early as 1972, much before the days of Nintendos Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda. This bulky ensemble of a black, white and brown box called the Odyssey, manufactured by Magnavox, pales in comparison to the sophisticated modern-day versions of Sonys PlayStation and Microsofts Xbox. Nevertheless, it marked the beginning of a new mode of entertainment.Today, according to statistics published by the Entertainment Software Association, a majority of frequent gamers find that consoles hold more value for money than DVDs, movies and music. Four out of five US households own a device used to play video games with the average age of a player being 35 years.Thus, it is not surprising that Pokémon Go did well in a region which has been addicted to gaming for decades. Augmented reality via a smartphone as opposed to the virtual world created within the confines of homes by consoles offers something of a fresh perspective to the ordinarily sedentary gamer. It lets an individual walk about his locality, represented by an avatar guided by his phones GPS, and catch, train and battle with virtual creatures superimposed on the real world. Even if one accounts for the incidents of falling off cliffs and mugging, or the claims that video games decrease the grey area of the brain, the game has a charm to it and an unreal one at that.The video game mania of the modern-day world is not however, restricted to its fetish for the unreal. It is also the huge level of self-actualization and gratification that a gamer feels when he catches them all as the catch phrase for any Pokémon game reminds us. Within the human brain is the reward system which is responsible for desire, pleasure and positive reinforcement. When rewardedsay with virtual monsters or other awardsthe brain releases a compound called dopamine which encodes information about the salience, value, and context of a reward. This reward system is the one which induces appetitive or consummatory behaviour. Psychological theories like operant conditioning say that the frequency of a behaviour will increase if rewarded and decrease if penalized. Other theories such as the one given by Wolfram Schultz propounds that unexpected rewards or rewards greater than expected can also increase dopamine levels.The most popular video games of the past few years such as Diablo and World of Warcraft have been known to capitalize on this reward-seeking mentality of the human brain. Pokémon Go provides all the key ingredients responsible for activating the reward systemgratification, fast pace and unpredictability. The key towards maintaining the public interest in the game in future will also lie in these very ingredients.Meanwhile, another gameto monetize Pokémon Gois already emerging in the backdrop. Ad agencies are already neck-deep in research to find out ways to lure customers to nearby shops and restaurants from PokéStops. According to an article in the Financial Times, Niantics previous release Ingress which also involved virtual portals mapped on streets had found good commercial footing owing to the willingness of retailers and service providers to pay for promotions in the game. Pokémon Go too shows similar, if not higher potential. The trick is to reap the benefits before the crescendo dies. Theythe programmers, the advertisers and entrepreneurshave just one motto too: Gotta Catch Em All.Will Pokémon Go find similar success rates in India?

-0.68,"New Delhi: Finance minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday announced plans to create a state-run behemoth by merging various public sector firms in the oil and gas sector.
				   
				We propose to create an integrated public sector oil major which will be able to match the performance of international and domestic private sector oil and gas companies, said Jaitley in his budget speech.International firms such as ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell plc and BP Plc have integrated operations across upstream exploration, refining and fuel retail.The Indian governments move comes in the backdrop of concerns articulated over rising oil prices presenting a challenge to the countrys growth. The price of crude oil in the Indian energy basket has increased from $39.9 in April 2016 to $52.7 in December 2016.The Indian energy basket represents the average of Oman, Dubai and Brent crude. The price was $54.63 per barrel on Friday.The state-owned firms in the oil and gas sector are; Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC), Oil India Ltd, GAIL (India) Ltd, Indian Oil Corp., Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Numaligarh Refinery Ltd, Chennai Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Engineers India Ltd,  Balmer Lawrie & Co. Ltd, and Biecco Lawrie Co. Ltd.We see opportunities to strengthen our CPSEs (central public sector enterprises) through consolidation, mergers and acquisitions. By these methods, the CPSEs can be integrated across the value chain of an industry. It will give them capacity to bear higher risks, avail economies of scale, take higher investment decisions and create more value for the stakeholders. Possibilities of such restructuring are visible in the oil and gas sector, Jaitley said.The concern over crude oil prices stems from Indias energy import bill of around $150 billion, expected to reach $300 billion by 2030. India imports around 80% of its crude oil and 18% of its natural gas requirements. India imported 202 million tonnes of oil in 2015-16.The state owned firms welcomed the move.Though the finer details are yet to come but the intention appears to form an integrated company on the lines of integrated oil firms such as ExxonMobil, Shell and BP, said Dinesh K. Sarraf, chairman and managing director, ONGC.This also comes at a time of faltering domestic crude oil and gas production and output cuts announced by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec). India is one of the major consumers of Opecs production, with the grouping accounting for 85% and 94% of Indias crude oil and gas imports.Indias energy demand growth is expected to outpace the other BRIC (Brazil, Russia, China, India) countries, according to the latest BP Energy Outlook released last week.The new entity will have economies of scale and Indian industrys negotiating power globally will increase significantly.

				Rami Rahim, an M.Sc. in electrical engineering from Stanford University and a Juniper veteran, has risen through the ranks to his current role of chief executive officer. In an interview, he talks about the changing digital landscape, the evolution of software-defined networking and the impact of cloud computing. Excerpts: Why did you feel the need to come up with another term, digital cohesion, when digital transformation already exists?The idea behind digital cohesion is to paint a vision of the future that people can relate to. When you talk about some of the advances in technology, in networking for example, while our partners, customers and stakeholders understand it inherently, but for a broader set of population, it is a bit difficult to relate to because they are not in this business. So digital cohesion paints an exciting vision of the future around technology and applications playing an interesting and important part in our day-to-day lives, of how these will come together to create truly life-enhancing experiences. And then to distil it down to a set of technology barriers that must be overcome in order for that vision to become a reality. Doing this makes the motivation to overcome those barriers really compelling.What will digital cohesion do that digital transformation wont?Digital transformation is typically around changes in business and technology, how these two come together to create new business opportunities through more agility and business efficiency. Digital cohesion is different: its coming together of applications and services to solve really interesting problems in the consumer and the business space. But both are important concepts.You have envisioned a world in which self-assembling apps will provide predictive, personalized services to people. Dont you think this will further increase the risk to personal privacy and data security? Right, this is one of the big barriers to this future in which the applications are always on in the background, as the mega cloud providers and service providers will need to collect a lot of information to be able to act on it. That can only happen when a lot of thought has been put into privacy policies and cyber security. As more and more applications are going to be connected, each of those connections presents an opening for the bad actors to come in and compromise the network and thus user data. We believe it will require a fundamentally different architectural approach to do what is necessary to improve the overall security posture of the network. What is the update on software-defined networking (SDN)?Any new technology or architecture goes through a hype cycle and SDN has gone through that cycle. About a year or so back, SDN was touted as the answer to most networking problems but that clearly is not the case. One should understand that software has always played a very important role in networking. In the past, our software and hardware systems were very tightly integrated but now they are loosely coupled and we are already offering software separately. Also, networking-as-a-service will add more value to the domain.At one point, Juniper was broad-basing its customer segment from telecom operators to other enterprises. But now with cloud coming up in a big way, most enterprises may not be buying networking gear at all. How is Juniper coping with this situation?The cloud is the single biggest trend that is impacting our industry and therefore our strategy today as a company. There are many types of companies in the cloud market, including the mega cloud companies, software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service players, co-location hosting providers and many others. This segment has been a very important part of our business and, over the past several years, revenue from these companies has double as a percentage of our total revenue. We are also helping telecom operators transform and grow their cloud, in addition to helping enterprises with a hybrid architecture in connecting their own data centres to the cloud. The approaching Internet of Things (IoT) world and your vision of digital cohesion will put a lot of strain on networks. What role will Juniper play here?I think IoT and 5G (fifth generation mobile technology) are both going to be cloud-native technologies. This means the services to the end consumers will be developed in a virtualized manner and delivered from a data centre. That is what we believe we are most suited forto provide the cloud infrastructure and solutions for data centres, wide area networks and the software that helps our customers in tapping into the cloud data centres with ease and agility.",2016-12-22,5a2p4CTEMC5oR85Il3Jx4J,"The cloud is the single biggest trend that is impacting our industry and therefore our strategy today as a company, says Juniper CEO Rami Rahim",competitor,00:58,Cloud is the biggest trend impacting networking industry: Juniper CEO

				Separately, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) will use the CBI chargesheet against Kingfisher Airlines, its officials and IDBI Bank officials to file a fresh extradition plea for Vijay Mallya, a senior official of the investigative agency said on condition of anonymity. A significant portion of the loans was disbursed by the bank was remitted out of India, said CBI in its 2,000-page chargesheet filed on 24 January. The chargesheet, a part of which was reviewed by Mint, names five retired IDBI bankers, four Kingfisher Airlines officials and Mallya, whom it called an absconder.Mallya-IDBI Bank CMD holiday meeting led to hasty sanction of Rs350 crore: EDThe CBI has already asked seven countries including the US, UK, Ireland, Mauritius and Switzerland  to conduct investigations in their respective jurisdictions and provide documentary evidence. CBI said it has so far unearthed a trail of Rs263 crore which it believes was diverted. CBIs investigation found that risk norms were flouted in sanctioning a short-term advance of Rs150 crore in addition to the Rs950 crore loan. It is relevant to mention here that the proposal was referred for credit rating almost a week after the disbursement of the entire loan amount, said the chargesheet.

The BJP and Congress on Monday traded charges over help extended to Vijay Mallya in securing loans and leaving the country, with the two parties hurling accusations at each other for coming to the aid of the beleaguered businessman. Ahead of the budget session beginning on Tuesday, the BJP sought to corner Congress, alleging the corrupt hands which helped Mallya secure bank loans belonged to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and finance minister P.Chidambaram.Vijay Mallya issue: Manmohan Singh, P. Chidambaram deny BJPs allegationsSingh and Chidambaram rejected the charge, and the Congress targeted the Modi government over allowing the former liquor baron to leave for foreign shores. BJP spokesman Sambit Patra quoted from purported letters written by Mallya to Singh seeking his intervention to bail out KFA, following which it got loans. Singh  told the media that it was routine for businessmen to write letters to the government which were marked to appropriate authorities and that they did not violate any law. I think what I have done was done with full satisfaction of mind that we were not doing anything which was against law of the land.Patra cited another letter the liquor baron, who has been declared a proclaimed offender by a court, allegedly wrote to Chidambaram in March 2013, seeking his intervention to get a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from State Bank of India when his liquor company United Spirits Ltd was in talks with Diageo Plc. over a deal. Mint couldnt ascertain the context of that letter, but SBI heads the consortium that loaned money to KFA.The letter does not concern Kingfisher, it concerns United Spirits Limited, which was and is a thriving, flourishing profitable company. The letter does not talk about any loan, the letter talks about an NOC for a preferential allotment of shares. That is capital, equity, not loans, Chidambaram told reporters.  Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala posed a string of questions to BJP, asking the ruling party to explain who was responsible for allowing Mallya to leave India at a time when the consortium of lenders were moving against him.  Why has Modi Government not sought deportation of Vijay Mallya from UK till today? Surjewala asked.

				Growing Internet access, largely through smartphones, and the increasing emphasis on cashless transactions make it a potentially lucrative market for e-commerce.The countrys sheer size and its population make it a potentially big market for e-commerce.Not surprisingly, Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal are battling it out for supremacy in this market, estimated to be worth $38 billion this year, according to industry lobby group Assocham. Still, success will be more a function of how these three deal with the regulatory and market conditions than how they do with each other.Indias policy regarding foreign investment in retail is fluid. On paper, the country allows foreign investment in supermarkets and department stores, although this policy was crafted by the earlier government and the current dispensation in New Delhi, while not keen to undo a reformist policy, has made it clear that it will not sign off on any applications. Its policy on e-commerce is just a little more complex. India allows 100% foreign direct investment in marketplaces, which provide a technology, payment and delivery platform that connects buyers and sellers. And it places curbs on the extent any one seller can dominate the marketplace, and on discounts.The regulatory regime is likely transient. India should, sooner than later, allow foreign investment in supermarkets and also in e-commerce sites that are hybrid models allowing direct retail and serving as a marketplace (Amazon follows this model in many countries, including the US). But until then, the challenge for Amazon, Flipkart, and Snapdeal is not to fall foul of it. The situation is exacerbated by traditional retailers who have taken both the legal and the lobbying route to prevent the march of the marketplaces. Some of this opposition comes from small so-called kirana or mom-and-pop stores. And some definitely comes from Indian Big Retail that would like some protection against deep-pocketed marketplaces. Indeed, a Nielsen report in 2015 showed that online retail in India is growing more at the expense of modern and organized retail than at the cost of kirana stores.Thats the first challenge. The second is to build a brand and, through that, brand loyalty. Through 2014 and 2015, the marketplaces have been big advertisers on TV and in print, proof that the ability of the digital medium to build brands is still suspect. Despite that, none has managed to build brand loyalty. In part, the marketplaces themselves are to blame.They have used their capital, including venture capital, to fund discountsto such an extent that many shoppers have been conditioned to expect significant discounts, sometimes in excess of 50%. To be sure, many have now gone slow on such sales, and will likely go slower, given the new government policy. The brand, and brand loyalty challenge remain.The third is to get the supply chain and customer service rightnot the easiest thing to do when millions of products are being sold to millions of customers across a few hundred cities and towns. Of the three marketplaces, only Amazon seems to have really focused on this, and the results are there for all to see.

0.15,"There are enough dirges being sung for public sector banks, but strangely the performance of their stocks after their quarterly results does not reflect this. 
				   
				Five out of the seven public sector banks that reported quarterly results on Friday made a loss and the profit-makers, State Bank of India (SBI) and Oriental Bank of Commerce, showed a worse bad loan ratio. But their shares surged, with SBI rising more than 7%, and Bank of India gaining over 10%. Here are a few reasons why investors believe theres value in bank stocks, despite the rash of bad loans.Falling rate of slippages: This is one of the clearest signs that public sector banks are getting a grip on the bad loan problem. Lenders labelled a massive Rs.1.5 trillion worth of loans as non-performing in the March quarter. In the June quarter, the addition has come down to Rs.50,000 crore. This is something investors are cheering.Provisions: Banks have provided for most of the big troubled accounts in the March quarter, courtesy the Reserve Bank of Indias asset quality review. Provisions have halved for the 25 public sector lenders in the June quarter. Sure, some more skeletons may tumble out of the cupboard. But these are unlikely to be of the magnitude of provisions made in the March quarter. What do lower provisions mean? Higher profits, of course.Retail loan growth: Barring big banks such as SBI and Bank of Baroda, public sector lenders were slow to wake up to Indias consumption story. But now, every public sector bank has announced its plan to focus on retail lending. Rising retail consumption, which is fuelled by personal loans, could well pull them out of their credit abyss. Retail loan growth at Bank of India was 13%, at Union Bank of India 14% and that at SBI 20% in the June quarter.Merge or perish: For the public sector lenders to survive, some will have to die. The government is more open now than before for consolidation that would create a handful of strong and valuable lenders. A start is the merger of its associates with SBI. It will be tricky to forecast a turnaround in the fortunes of banks, although some bankers say this could happen in the first quarter of 2017-18.  Barring SBI, all public sector lenders have a price-to-book value ratio of below one. Until the dust settles, these rock-bottom valuations will keep calling to investors.",2016-08-15,5yRFwAXonxqCjpTtnGYJxN,"To foretell the timing of the turnaround of the public sector banks is tricky, although bankers insist that this would happen as early as the first quarter of FY18

				A division bench comprising justices Jayant M. Patel and Aravind Kumar observed that there was a prima facie case against Mallya and asked him to appear before the court. The case relates to Mallya allegedly violating an undertaking to the Bengaluru bench of the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) that he would not dispose of his share holdings. In July 2013, Mallya, Kingfisher Airlines Ltd and United Breweries Holdings Ltd (UBHL) had given the undertaking to the DRT, shortly after SBI had moved petitions against the company and its promoters over unpaid dues of over Rs 9,000 crore. Mallya had pledged over 1.04 crore shares (around 4.023% of the total share capital) of United Breweries Ltd, the company said in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange on 30 August 2013.  In another filing on the same day, the company had said that Mallya and his son Siddhartha had pledged around their entire holding of 3.95% or 1.04 crore shares. The bank said the share pledge was a violation of the earlier undertaking. Mallyas legal team contested that the undertaking could not restrain him from pledging his shares. On 27 August 2014, SBI had filed a civil contempt petition (CCC) against Mallya in the Karnataka high court. The bank has maintained that Mallya and his company have tried to defeat the proceedings initiated against them before the DRT.The direction to appear before the HC comes at a time when enforcement authorities and secured lenders have been relentlessly seeking the return of Mallya from the UK.

0.09,"Over the past few years, several policymakers have been heard complaining that Indian firms are not investing enough. The latest data on asset sales provides a clear and stark answer for that phenomenon: the Indian economy is currently going through the biggest deleveraging of the past quarter century, if not the biggest in history.
				   
				Data sourced from Thomson Reuters Eikon show that Indian companies have sold more assets in 2016 than they have in any year since liberalization. It is no wonder then that private investments have been tepid as the deleveraging process picked up pace over the past year or so. The data shows that asset-sale deals announced, pending or completed in 2016 are worth $40.85 billion. This beats the previous peak of $27.96 billion announced in 2007 by a wide margin. The Reuters data covers any tangible asset, branch, division, operations or subsidiary sold off by a parent firm.While the previous peak was driven by demand from investors who wanted a stake in the India growth story, the current round of asset sales has been driven largely by distress of indebted corporations. Essar features in the list of top deals in both 2007 and 2016. The top deals in 2007 include Vodafones acquisition of Hutchison Essar and Matsushita Electric Works acquisition of Anchor Electricals. The top deals of 2016 include the sale of controlling stake in Essar Oil to PJSC Rosneft Oil Co by the heavily indebted Essar group, and UltraTech Cement Ltds acquisition of Jaypee Groups cement assets. However, in terms of completed deals, 2016 has seen lower amount of such deals compared to previous years but that is largely because many of the asset sales are yet to receive regulatory approvals.As the charts below show, the asset sales have been led by stressed firms in the debt-laden sectors of the Indian economy such as energy, real estate, and metals. Many of the leading firms in these sectors are owned by some of the most indebted corporate groups of the country.The debt overhang of Indias corporate sector has been many years in the making and the unwinding of debt is taking almost as much time as the accumulation of debt. The seeds of the current debt problems were sown during the effervescent lending of the boom years in the mid-2000s. The credit boom leading up to the great global financial crash of 2008 witnessed a dilution of lending norms by banks and an aggressive asset-buying spree by Indian corporations. The financial crash brought an end to such excesses, and the boom turned to bust. In a 2012 report, Credit Suisse pointed out that the borrowings of the top 10 indebted conglomerates in the country (which included Essar, Reliance ADAG, Vedanta, Adani and the Jaypee group) had grown five times in the five years leading up to 2012 to Rs5.4 trillion, which equalled 13% of total bank loans.Even then, delayed recognition of bad loans by banks and regulatory forbearance by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) ensured that indebted firms and conglomerates did not face the pressures of paying back their debts that they are faced with today. In a 2015 update of their original report, Credit Suisse pointed out that the total borrowings of the top 10 indebted groups stood at Rs7.3 trillion.Thanks to tightening of norms related to restructuring of assets, and greater power provided to lenders to recover dues, promoters have been forced to consider selling distressed assets and subsidiaries to retire some of their debt. Some of the top deals of the past year feature firms owned by the top 10 indebted corporate groups and other large indebted conglomerates.But does this years asset-selling spree signal an end to Indias debt woes? Most analysts suggest that is unlikely. In fact, the debt problem has become more acute for companies which are not able to meet their interest obligations or have an interest cover less than 1. Contrary to expectations of a recovery in stressed companies, the share of debt with interest cover (IC) saw a slight increase up to 39% vs 38%. The share of chronically stressed companies also increased to 34% vs 32% QoQ, and 30% (vs 34%) debt was with loss-making companies, noted a 19 September Credit Suisse report by analysts Ashish Gupta, Kush Shah and Prashant Kumar. Bankers have pointed out that cash from many asset sales is only enough to stay out of debt trouble for a year or so. And once cash-generating assets have been sold, it could lead to fresh problems for indebted groups as the cash from the deals run out. It is likely that bankers or promoters, or more likely both, would have to take a hit in the coming quarters. A 20 September Religare Capital Markets Ltd report, which examined six steel companies to analyse their debt servicing capability, noted that EBITDA (or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) would have to triple for these companies to be able to meet their debt obligations. Given the limited upsides to EBITDA (ex-sale of non-core assets), we believe debt servicing will be possible only post a 35-40% loan haircut by banks, said the report authored by analysts Pritesh Jani, Parag Jariwala and Vikesh Mehta. The continuing spectre of further deleveraging seems to have affected risk appetite across the economy. As the chart below shows, cash levels have witnessed a rise for Indian firms after the crash of 2008 even though indebted firms have lagged others. Yet, the hangover of debt and the turning of the credit cycle seems to be deterring firms from making new investments.The tepid investment climate has affected overall demand in the economy and in turn hurt the debt-servicing capabilities of the indebted groups, analysts say.Indias debt issues will not be solved without an improvement in growth or a pick-up in demand, said V. Balasubramanian, head of equities at IDBI Mutual Fund.The problem is huge, said Balasubramanian. And even the biggest year of asset sales will likely fall short of solving it.This is the first of a four-part data journalism series on corporate debt in the country.

-0.62,"Tough negotiations are under way between GAIL (India) Ltd and two bidding groups that applied to charter nine new liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers required by the state-run gas processor and distributor for shipping gas from the US.
				   
				The intense bargaining is over the three LNG tankers that are to be built in India as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modis Make in India programme. The two consortiums comprising mainly Japanese fleet owners with a strong presence in LNG shipping want GAIL or the government to take on potential risks associated with the Indian-built LNG tankers, which would be the first such sophisticated ships built locally. GAIL doesnt want to assume the risks and is waiting for the government to take a position.A consortium of Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd (MOL)-Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha Ltd (NYK Line) and Mitsui and Co. Ltd and another group comprising Mitsubishi Corp.-Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd (K Line)-GasLog Ltd and Foresight Ltd are eyeing the long-term deal because of its sheer sizeworth around $7 billion. Such long-term shipping contracts translate into huge cost savings for GAIL and for the end-use consumers of LNG, a clean source of fuel which India is seeking to rely on to cut carbon emissions.Executives briefed on the tender issued by GAIL for the second time in two years (the first one failed because no one showed up), says there was an attempt by global shipowners to scuttle the bidding process and the Make in India plan by putting conditions that either GAIL or the government may find it difficult to accept.Conversations with these executives, who declined to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media, gives an insight into the role played by local representatives (mostly looking after crewing and other ship agency functions and not well versed with ship construction) of bidding groups in influencing their top bosses in the Tokyo headquarters on the perils of building LNG ships in India and to avoid taking perceived risks associated with this. A GAIL executive summed this up pretty well by saying that the company faced more resistance in pursuing the tender from the local representatives of the bidding groups than from senior executives based in Japan.To illustrate the point, a local representative with one of the bidding groups voiced concern during a meeting on the possible de-hiring of Indian-built LNG ships by GAIL, citing the example of Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd, which a few months ago prematurely cancelled contracts on ships taken on a long-term basis to support its oil exploration activities after daily rentals crashed due to a plunge in crude prices. However, those were small and old vessels which cannot be compared with the sheer scale of the Make in India project, intended to promote local manufacturing.Initially, even GAIL was not willing to get three of the nine LNG ships built in India, but had to change course following a directive from the ministry of petroleum and natural gas.Similarly, fleet owners were extremely reluctant to build these tankers in India due to concerns over construction time line, quality issues and risks associated with running such ships. Again, they had to relent after the government clearly indicated that it was going to use its LNG buying clout to get local yards to enter the highly lucrative LNG shipbuilding business.The LNG cargo purchasing power has been used by other nations such as South Korea and China to promote and augment their local shipping fleet or to build ships locally.Much has happened since the plan was unveiled. Indias state-owned Cochin Shipyard Ltd has managed to get a technology tie-up with South Koreas Samsung Heavy Industries Co. Ltd to build the LNG carriers. It has also secured a licence from French firm GTT to use its patented Mark-III LNG containment systems.It is imperative for both the government/GAIL and the bidders to meet half way to make this a reality. There should be give and takes in such an exercise; thats how plans such as Make in India can work.It would be childish on the part of global fleet owners to assume that Indian-built LNG ships may lack quality and run into operational problems, resulting in financial implications for them.After all, even the Japanese and the South Koreans, who are reputed LNG shipbuilders in the world today, got started at some point. There is always a first time.Having said that, the government and GAIL should not let go of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to start building LNG ships locally for want of a final push in the last lap of the tendering process.There are many upsides to this, one among them being the huge employment it can generate, which is also a political plank of the government.The government needs to guard against those trying to derail the process.

It is entirely RBIs decision and the central bank would decide after making holistic assessment of the situation, he said.According to SBIs research report Ecowrap, By the end of February, 78-88% of the currency could be back in the system under the best case scenario in terms of an optimal currency distribution (more small denomination notes), the report said, adding that it seems within next 2 months things would be pretty close to normal.Another senior public sector bank official said the situation is easing and it is a matter of weeks when the curb on withdrawal gets eased.Also Read: Enhance cash withdrawal limit of candidates, EC requests RBIMy hunch is that it should happen before end of the current fiscal, the official said, adding, RBI has been progressively easing the curb.The RBI had earlier increased the daily withdrawal limit from ATMs to Rs4,500 from Rs2,500 effective 1 January, just a day after 50-day demonetisation period ended.Meanwhile, RBI governor Urjit Patel could not set a time frame before the Standing Committee on Finance for return of normalcy in the banking system even as the central bank asserted that Rs9.2 lakh crore or 60% of demonetised currency has been replaced. In a surprise move on 8 November, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced demonetisation of old Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes. Following the decision, the RBI had put restrictions on withdrawal of cash from ATMs as well as from banks to deal with shortage of new high denomination currency notes. This led to long queues at ATMs and bank branches. All over the country, the banks had to deal with huge rush of people who thronged their branches to deposit junked notes.

-0.16,"Hong Kong/San Francisco: In Chinas internet warzone, theres a road map for success: find a rich backer, get lots of money, burn it to buy market share.
				   
				The latest chapter of that playbook is being written by two young entrepreneurs each offering an update on a former icon of Chinas communist partythe bicycle.In one corner is Dai Wei, 25, whose Beijing Bikelock Technology Co. cycle-sharing startup, known as Ofo, won about $100 million backing in September from investors including the venture fund backed by Xiaomi Corp. founder Lei Jun and Didi Chuxing, the ride-hailing giant that just beat Uber Technologies Inc. out of China. The funding is said to have valued the start-up at $500 million.In the other is Hu Weiwei, who received similar funding days later for her Beijing Mobike Technology Co. from a group including Tencent Holdings Ltd., the nations biggest internet company and, ironically, a long-term backer of Didi.This is the trial by fire of Chinas internet landscape, where alliances change in days and start-ups bleed billions of dollars offering freebies to get customers, only to merge months later so they can take on the next upcoming competitor.Tencent and Didi each picking a different winner makes the competition much more unpredictable and interesting, said Cao Yang, Beijing-based analyst at internet consultant IResearch. It really comes down to which founder can adapt faster and leverage resources better.Bike-sharing is hardly new. There are about 600 such operations globally, with a market that could grow by 20% a year to generate as much as $5.8 billion in revenue by 2020, according to consultancy Roland Berger.Most, like Pariss Velib or Londons so-called Boris Bikes are run or set up by the local government, often with corporate sponsors, and bikes are available from racks at set locations. What differentiates Ofo and Mobike is that users find and pay for bicycles via a smartphone app and then leave the vehicle wherever they want.Each company is targeting a different market. Mobike has gone for high-end branding with bikes that cost as much as 3,000 yuan ($440) to build and have snazzy orange wheels, solid-core tires and satellite navigation. Ofo is targeting students with bright yellow two-wheelers costing only about 250 yuan that dont have GPS and rent for just 1 yuan per hour, typically half that of Mobike. Beijings public bikes are free for the first hour and then 1 yuan per subsequent hour.Mobike locates its vehicles via an integrated GPS. Ofo so-named because the word looks like a bicycledoes so by tracking the smartphones of its riders and sending a code to unlock the bike.These guys all think they can be Amazon, hoping to burn money first and then make money later, said Rawen Huang, Hong Kong-based founder of Petrel Capital, which invests in Chinas internet space. Will we look back in five years time and say Oh my, I cant believe they got funding at that valuation? Probably.In the capitals electronics heartland of Zhongguancun, where high-tech heavyweights like Lenovo Group Ltd. rub shoulders with startups and malls crammed with gadgets, two of Ofos yellow bikes stand in the hallway outside an apartment, which Dai has converted to a makeshift office.In the early stages of a company, expanding is more important than defending, says Dai, echoing the insights imparted by his mentor Cheng Wei, founder of Didi. The faster you use your money, the more efficient, the more money you raise, the stronger you become. Then you control the market.Its a strategy that helped Didi beat off more than 30 rivals. At the height of its battle with Uber, both companies were burning through $1 billion a year, mostly to subsidize fares. Didi now handles more than 11 million rides a day across about 400 cities. While Didi has yet to become profitable, Dai said Ofo is already making money.Bespectacled and soft spoken, Dai gained the support of Didis early investors Wang Gang and GSR Ventures Allen Zhu. The Peking University Ph.D dropout founded Ofo with four other students, ditching their original project on cycling tourism to focus on bike-sharing.Wang was instrumental in helping Ofo find a big tree to lean on, securing not only financial backing from Didi, but also potential access to its 300 million users.A 30-minute bike ride away, in a technology incubator called 768 Creativity Shejiyuan, Hu Weiwei landed an even more powerful ally. Tencents WeChat instant messaging app has more than 800 million users and already integrates things like Didis car-hailing service and JD.com Inc.s shopping function.The 34-year-old former journalist said the two companies are starting to coordinate on certain technology aspects.In a second-floor office down a dark passageway, next to a communal toilet, Hu speaks in a low octave, punctuating her key message: The fact that Tencent is investing in us shows that we share the same philosophy about products and technology.The investment from Tencent, along with Hillhouse Capital and Sequoia Capital, couldnt have been more timely. Following Didis announcement it would back Ofo, users like Shanghai-based Mike Huang began unsubscribing from Mobike to get back their 299 yuan deposits on concern the company would shut down.It just shows you how important the big companies are for the survival of start-ups in China, said Huang, an entrepreneur who has a womens health app. He resubscribed after hearing about the Tencent investment. Chinese internet companies are still in that phase of burning cash to win market share and the brutality of competition is even worse than Silicon Valley.Ofo and Mobike will need more than discounts to win users, they need bikes.Mobike said it has about 30,000 bicycles spread across the major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, which have an estimated combined urban population of more than 74 million. It aims to stock at least 100,000 bikes for each city by year-end and expand to other cities.Compare that with the more than 66,500 public bikes offered by the public transport corporation of Hangzhou, a city of about 8 million.Ofo says it has more than 85,000 bikes, mostly on university campuses, and expects to take its service to other places in China. Both rivals are eyeing markets in Europe.The ride-sharers are trying to reverse a decline in cycling in China, which spent the past two decades promoting cars. China had 670 million bikes in 1995. By 2013 it had 370 million.For some Beijingers, the billion-dollar fight between Ofo and Mobike comes down to which happens to be more convenient.I dont care whose bike it is, Ill use one if I spot one and feel too lazy to walk, said Guang Geng, who works in the Zhongguancun area. Honestly I just tell them apart by color. Bloomberg",2016-10-31,6k9UmdZnwfiV4Vttd1CAII,"Ofo and Mobike will need more than discounts to win users in China, they need bikes",both,14:24,Ofo fuels Chinas bike-share battle
0.25,"San Francisco/Washington: After Facebooks removal of an iconic Vietnam war photo stirred an international uproar last month, the social networks executives quickly backtracked and cleared its publication.
				   
				But the imageshowing a naked Vietnamese girl burned by napalmhad previously been used in training sessions as an example of a post that should be removed, two former Facebook employees told Reuters.Trainers told content-monitoring staffers that the photo violated Facebook policy, despite its historical significance, because it depicted a naked child, in distress, photographed without her consent, the employees told Reuters.The social network has taken great pains to craft rules that can be applied uniformly with minimal discretion. The reversal on the war photo, however, shows how Facebooks top executives sometimes overrule company policy and its legions of low- and mid-level content monitors.Facebook has often insisted that it is a technology companynot a media companybut an elite group of at least five senior executives regularly directs content policy and makes editorial judgment calls, particularly in high-profile controversies, eight current and former Facebook executives told Reuters.One of those key decision-makers - Justin Osofsky, who runs the community operations division - wrote a Facebook post acknowledging that the removal of the war photo was a mistake.Sometimes, he wrote, the global and historical significance of a photo like Terror of War outweighs the importance of keeping nudity off Facebook.Facebook spokeswoman Christine Chen declined to comment on the companys use of the photo in training sessions.Facebook has long resisted calls to publicly detail its policies and practices on censoring postings. That approach has drawn criticism from users who have had content removed and free-speech advocates, who cite a lack of transparency and a lack of an appeals process for many content decisions.At the same time, some governments and anti-terror groups are pressuring the company to remove more posts they consider offensive or dangerous.High-level reviewThe current and former Facebook executives, most of them speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters in detail how complaints move through the companys content-policing apparatus. The toughest calls, they said, rise to an elite group of executives.Another of the key decision-makers is Global Policy Chief Monika Bickert, who helped rule on the fracas over the war photo. That was one we took a hard look at, and we decided it definitely belonged on the site, said Bickert, a former federal prosecutor.She declined to elaborate on the decision-making process.Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg followed up with an apology to Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg, who had posted the photo on her own account after Facebook removed it from others in her country.In addition to Sandberg, Osofsky and Bickert, executives involved in sensitive content issues include Joel Kaplan, Facebooks Washington-based government relations chief; and Elliot Schrage, the vice president for public policy and communications.All five studied at Harvard, and four of them have both undergraduate and graduate degrees from the elite institution. All but Sandberg hold law degrees. Three of the executives have longstanding personal ties to Sandberg.Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, a Harvard drop-out, occasionally gets involved with content controversies, Bickert said. These executives also weigh in on content policy changes meant to reflect shifting social context and political sensitivities around the world, current and former executives said.Facebook officials said the five people identified by Reuters were not the only ones involved in high-level content decisions.Facebook has a broad, diverse and global network involved in content policy and enforcement, with different managers and senior executives being pulled in depending on the region and the issue at hand, Chen said.Chen declined to name any other executives who were involved in content policy.A war over free expressionThe companys reticence to explain censorship decisions has drawn criticism in many countries around the globe.Last month, Facebook disabled the accounts of editors at two of the most widely read Palestinian online publications, Shehab News Agency and Quds. In keeping with standard company practice, Facebook didnt publicly offer a reason for the action or pinpoint any content it considered inappropriate.The company told Reuters that the removal was simply an error.Some Palestinian advocacy groups and media outlets condemned the shutdowns as censorship stemming from what they described as Facebooks improper alliance with the Israeli government.Israels government has pushed Facebook to block hundreds of pages it believes incite violence against Jews, said Noam Sela, spokesman for Israeli cabinet Minister Gilad Erdan.Sela said the Israeli government had a connection at Facebook to handle complaints but declined to elaborate on the relationship.Its not working as well as we would like, Sela said. We have more work to do to get Facebook to remove these pages.Ezz al-Din al-Akhras, a Quds supervisor, said that Facebooks head of policy in the Middle East had gotten in touch after the uproar over the shutdowns and that three of four suspended accounts were restored.We hope the Facebook campaign of suspending and removing Palestinian accounts will stop, he said. We do not practice incitement; we are only conveying news from Palestine to the world.Facebook said the restoration of the accounts was not a response to complaints. It declined to comment on whether top executives were involved.The company has cited technological glitches in other recent cases where content was removed, then restored, including the takedown of a video that showed the aftermath of a Minneapolis police shooting.Chen declined to explain the glitch.She said the company was reviewing its appeals process in response to public feedback. Facebook currently allows appeals of company actions involving entire profiles set up by people or institutions, or full pages on those profiles, but not for individual posts.Thick rulebookTo manage the huge volume of content complaintsmore than a million a daythe company employs a multi-layered system. It starts with automated routing of complaints to content-policing teams in Dublin, Hyderabad, Austin and Menlo Park, who make initial rulings, current and former executives said.These low-level staffers and contractors consult a thick rulebook that interprets the comparatively spare community standards that Facebook customers are asked to follow. The company trains front-line monitors to follow rules and use as little discretion as possible.When a removal sparks more complaints, regional managers function as a mid-level appeals court. Continuing controversy could then push the issue to top US executives.Senior executives also weigh in on policy updates. Osofsky and Kaplan, for instance, wrote a blog post last week, in response to continued feedback on content removals, explaining that the company would start weighing news value more heavily in deciding whether to block content.In an earlier post, responding to the Napalm-girl controversy, Osofsky said Facebooks policies usually work well, but not always.In many cases, theres no clear line between an image of nudity or violence that carries global and historic significance and one that doesnt, Osofsky wrote.The Vietnam war photo - depicting horrors suffered by a girl named Phan Thi Kim Phuc - was first removed from an account in Norway by a front-line monitor.In protest, the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten printed the image on its front page and posted it on Facebook, which removed it. That prompted the prime minister to post the photo - only to have Facebook remove it again.Facebook then issued a statement defending the action, saying it was difficult to create a distinction between allowing a photograph of a nude child in one instance and not others.The next day, executives reversed the call, with Sandberg telling the prime minister: Even with clear standards, screening millions of posts on a case-by-case basis every week is challenging. Reuters",2016-10-28,6mOurn1xWIrB7baOqwGeHJ,"Facebooks senior executives regularly directs content policy and makes editorial judgement calls, particularly in high-profile controversies ",competitor,11:31,Facebook executives feel the heat of content controversies
-1.0,"Bengaluru: A little over two decades back, K.R.Sridhar worked on a NASA mission to convert Martian atmospheric gases to oxygen for propulsion and life support. His work was so ahead of its time that Fortune magazine called him one of the top five futurists inventing tomorrow, today.
				   
				Fast forward to 2016, and the Indian-born rocket scientist-turned-entrepreneur is on a completely different mission: to provide clean, reliable energy for all on Earth.Sridhar, who founded Silicon Valley-based Bloom Energy that makes electricity from (solid oxide) fuel cells using natural gas, has finally brought the technology to India.In an interview with Mint, he talked about how it all started, the efficiency of green technology, why India needs it now more than ever and how it will navigate a few challenges unique to Asias third-largest economy. Edited excerpts:How did Bloom Energy come about?I started out trying to figure out how to create oxygen on Mars, and then along the way, to create water, breathing air, electricity and all those things so that you can think of a sustainable habitat. So I was working on that, but clearly American interest in space exploration started waning after the Cold War because we had other interests and other places to spend our money on. So I realized that seeing a human mission to Mars is not going to happen within the time frame, maybe not in my lifetime. So I started thinking of what I could do that could be impactful. I realized that water and energy are the biggest issues we are going to face in the next 100 years, given that we will get to 10 billion people on the planet. I also knew that if I had cleaner electricity, I could always provide clean water.What do you want to accomplish in India?India is a perfect place for us to prove our basic value proposition: which is you need to decentralize before you distribute it. India has proven that more than any other countryboth in computing and in telecom. If you think about supply of electricity and given when it is available, the extremely bad quality of that supply and the extreme environmental impact of that supply, we can take a page from computing and apply it to power and create distributed, sustainable power all over the country. It can become the model for the rest of the world to follow.Is it hard to sell your technology in a country like India?It is harder and easier. Its harder because until now the gas infrastructure did not exist and there wasnt a company like GAIL telling people, you buy this and we will provide the infrastructure for you and we will provide a reliable supply of gas for you. So it was hard. It is easier because in a place like the US, while they are hurling towards technology and are not afraid of new technology, the grid was fairly adequate and there was enough access to power and there wasnt a demand-supply mismatch. Whereas here, you are offering people power against not having power. So, its easier from that perspective. So it is both.There are many who think that a decentralised (generation and distribution) model will not work for gas-based technologies in India, but only in markets similar to the US. What are your thoughts?Natural gas will be the most abundantly available fuel in the 21st century for electric power generation around the world. This abundance will result in increasingly improved economics and an expanded global export market. Add the fact that natural gas is the lowest carbon fossil fuel and you have a very attractive fuel for power generation. This is the significance of our partnership with GAIL which is committed to expanding the natural gas infrastructure for decentralized power generation in India. With this, we believe that decentralised gas-fuelled power generation has a bright future in India and will help this country make the same kind of technology leapfrog in power generation from centralized to distributed that we have seen in telephonythe country avoided the fixed infrastructure investments of landline telephones and went straight to mobile.Your tariffs are still considerably above other alternate sources of power.The important question is what you are providing. Do they find the value in what you are doing. You may have a (cheaper) solar power plan, but with a solar panel on your roof, if you cannot turn on the lights in the night, when the sun is not shining, that power is not of much use to you. It doesnt matter what it costs.You may get a (cheaper) coal power plan because of which your child can study because the lights are on, but if that childs life is going to be reduced by 10 years because of all the pollution it puts up, you are going to wonder if that is the best alternative.A household may think, cheap power is good enough, why do I need more. The average life of all their appliances in their house is going down so fast because of problems with voltage and stability. They are never able to calculate the cost associated with that. They sometimes dont realize that they are paying significantly more for a refrigerator because the company had to build all these additional band-aids for that power, to make sure the warranty problem doesnt come to them and charge them more. It is about total overall value, as opposed to the essential value of commodities. That is an education that we have to do.We absolutely know that we have a learning curve and a cost curve. We are confident that over a few years with scale, people will use us not just because of all the positive attributes we bring, but also be cause we are the most affordable.How do you plan to procure biogas? Though GAIL has promised you natural gas, you will need more supply. So think of this1.3, fast forward 1.4 billion people in the nationthe amount of human waste, the amount of animal waste that comes from supporting this, the amount of plant waste that comes from supporting the animals and the plants is gigantic and it is either a liability or can be converted into an asset. And to us, it should be an asset and that becomes the biogas fuel. In the past, it was always a problem because the power plants were very, very large and you needed to go long distances to collect the biomass, bringing it to a huge centralized base and the cost of carrying it over a long distance was incredible.But, in the distributed Bloom model, people can take their own bio-waste and put that into their own bio-mass plant, generate their own biogas and produce their own power. And, in a true Gandhian way, can have a completely sustained solution.Are you happy with GAILs infrastructure in Bengaluru (where Bloom is powering technology company Intels R&D lab)?I dont think GAIL will say they are happy with it because they are aggressively trying to get into Bangalore, and as you know, in any big city like Bangalore, there are issues of being able to lay a pipeline quickly and all that. However, what I am extremely impressed with is the aggressive speed and passion with which they want to get it done, in spite of obstacles.What incentives are you offering to get more companies to sign up?You do that when you dont believe in your product. Our product more than speaks for itself. We are satisfying an unmet need. Those corporate customers have a root canal. I am offering them a pain killer. I dont need to discount it.But, if you look at the US, places where it worked were states where there were incentives or subsidies. Isnt it?True, there are different ways to look at it. If it were a level-playing field, we would require more subsidies. Because everyone else is subsidized. Not giving a subsidy to us puts us on an uneven playing field. That is the reason we need subsidies in the US.Could you eventually think of powering individual homes too?It may not be the best thing because if you think of individual homes, the evenings and mornings, when you do all these things, that (is when) you may be consuming power. It may be capital inefficient for you to have a piece of equipment that is not working for you all the time. It will better for a cluster of homes and businesses to be in a little micro-grid. I think thats a better solution than having a little box in every home.Where exactly will your fuel cell packs be installed?It should be right where you use it and where its under your control. Typically, you never did that because these power generators were noisy, they vibrated and so you liked to put it far awayout of sight, out of mind. Here is a beautiful looking piece of equipment, children can play around it, people can have a picnic table around it. You can put it on a rooftop, on a basement or next to a parking lot. For the same amount of energy that you can produce, we require 120 times less land. So, (while) land use is a big issue usually (with respect to  power generation), this is a non-issue for us.When are you going public?Going public is just a step of a long process for a company. It is not even the beginning to the end, its just one small step. When we are ready, we will do it. We are definitely closer to it than we were.People can think what they want. It is a private company and our stakeholdersour investors, customers and employeesare all happy with the path we have taken.Are you profitable?We can state with no uncertainty that if we dont find a path to make our own company sustainable, we cannot make the planet sustainable. We have a path for sustainability, both for us and our planet. Being a private company we dont discuss these things.Can you tell me about your energy capacity? Where do you see it in five years?We are very actively engaged in building a pipeline for customers. We have actively started engaging with prospective customers. Obviously in the regions where natural gas is available like Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad. Places like that where there is both an availability of natural gas and a supply-demand mismatch, where electricity is a problem. Hopefully, next year, when you see me, the numbers will be impressive.Could you possibly look at local manufacturing of fuel cells to bring costs down?We already manufacture some component systems in India and make use of supply chain partners which also contribute Make in India manufactured goods which are incorporated into our systems. As the market develops in India and volume justifies it, we expect more Make in India content in our systems.Will Bloom Energy seek to source biogas from local plants for generation of electricity if enough natural gas is not available?This is among the options we are considering, especially in more rural areas.How do you plan to raise funds?As a private company, we dont discuss our funding requirements. We are a very healthy company, well-positioned to execute our business plan.Costs associated with building and maintaining fuel cells are pretty high. How can you change that?We are already economically attractive for certain types of customersthose commercial or government entities that have significant business critical operations that cannot suffer interruption of power. Like any new, transformative technology, Blooms technology is riding a steep cost-down path as innovation and market volume forces come together to bring down cost. We are extremely confident that this trend will continue for many years.How do you rate India companies when it comes to sustainability initiatives?We applaud that sustainability is an increasing focus for India Inc. Much is left to be done and the challenge is significant to improving the sustainability of business operations in India and for the society.What are the three biggest problems with Indias power infrastructure?We see the three biggest challenges as lack of access and adequate supply of electric power to fully support the society, challenges with power reliability and power outages, and still high CO2, high nox (oxides of Nitrogen), sox (oxides of sulphur) and particulate emissions relative to what is possible today with an advanced technology such as Bloom.Whats your advice to young entrepreneurs?Pick something you are passionate (about), because there are so many ups and downs. To be able to still go ahead, that passion needs to be strong. It should be yours and not someone elses.(Theres) nothing wrong in being a capitalist, nothing wrong in wanting to make money. But money is a lot more satisfying, if you also find something that has a social impact.Gireesh Chandra Prasad in New Delhi contributed to this story",2016-10-17,6p08znifFPuASBf1TXMe6I,"KR Sridhar talks about the efficiency of green technology, why India needs it and how Bloom Energy will navigate through challenges unique to the country",competitor,01:17,Decentralized gas-fuelled power generation has a bright future: Bloom Energy CEO

1.0,"Singapore: Seventeen years ago an Indian man from New Delhi mesmerized the technology departments of global corporations with a doomsday story many times more puffed up than the luxuriant crop of hair he sported.
				   
				The latter was a wig, and the former was just bad science fiction packaged by consultants as a $600 billion hair-raiser. But Dewang Mehta, the chief lobbyist for Indias fledgling software services industry, carried off both with aplomb, convincing businesses that at the stroke of midnight of the new millennium, their computer systems would crash because old programs measured years in two digits instead of four. The solution, he persuaded them, was to let a horde of techies from Bangalore and Hyderabad go through each line of code and fix the Y2K bug. That was the birth of Indias massively successful software services industry, which died on Friday after a short battle with newer digital technologies. At the time of its demise, the business was worth $110 billion in annual export revenue.The first hint that the end was near came on Thursday when Tata Consultancy Services, the biggest Indian software vendor by market value, announced a virtual stalling of its business in the September quarter from the previous three months. After Infosys followed up by slashing its full-year revenue guidance for the second time in three months, it was time to turn off the ventilator.Infosys revenue growth pre-LehmanA coroners inquiry unearthed three signs of decay, the first of which shows how Indian companies cheap-talent-fueled growth ran out of breath. In the four quarters before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Infosys saw revenue increase an average 29% in constant-currency terms. Back then, Dublin-based Accentures growth was just half as high. But theres nothing exceptional about Indian companies expansion anymore. All that investors have heard from managements this year is gloomy commentary on how challenging its become to get clients to open their wallets. When the companies do make news nowadays, its more often for dodgy business practices, regulatory slaps on the wrist, and senior-level exits.A slowdown alone wouldnt have stopped the Indian industry if it had been able to embrace smac, or social, mobile, analytics and cloud-based technologies. But the vendors wasted so much time defending their legacy business of writing code for and maintaining purpose-built enterprise applications that they failed to make a mark in the new digital world. As an analysis from  Mint shows, the dominant trio of Tata Consultancy, Infosys and Wipro between them had 1.5 times more workers doing digital stuff last year than Accenture. But the revenue they garnered was 40% less than what the latter chalked up from newer technologies. That makes the typical digital-tech employee of an Indian vendor 25% as efficient as his counterpart at the global consultant. This gap sets the clock back on Indian companies, which have taken years to narrow the productivity differential:Maybe its just banking clients and their inability to pay like they once did. Or perhaps its a combination of weak global growth, Brexit, protectionism and Donald Trumps vacillating stance on US visas for Indian technology workers. Hoping that turbulence is temporary, investors are still paying a hefty premium for future growth. They may get lucky for a while. Still, a dead-cat bounce from delayed orders coming through would hardly count as proof of life.The millennium scare got Indian software a foot in the door at global corporations. But now the shoe is on the other foot. Robotics and artificial intelligence are putting the vendors labour-intensive business at risk of obsolescence.

-0.66,"Mphasis Ltds shares rose 3.18% on Tuesday, on news that the race for buying Hewlett-Packard Co.s (HPs) 60.5% stake in the company is hotting up. 
				   
				The Times of India said on Monday that Tech Mahindra Ltd is leading the race and is contemplating an offer that is at a 20% premium to the recent market price of Mphasis.Its true that a 20% premium to the current market price will be an aggressive offer. But its a bit premature for minority shareholders of Mphasis to get excited. This is because any decent offer will be possible only if HP sweetens the deal for the acquirer.As things stand, about a fourth of the companys revenue comes via HP, and it is declining at a fast pace. In the December quarter, revenue from the HP channel fell by almost 12% quarter-on-quarter. Five years ago, this business had an annual revenue run rate of $700 million; it has now fallen to around $220 million, based on the December quarter revenue. At this rate, the business will soon disappear. It doesnt make sense for any acquirer to pay a premium, unless HP provides some surety for providing business to Mphasis for at least three-five years. This may well be in HPs interest as well, as a decent- enough premium will help HP garner nearly $1 billion from the sale. But, of course, this cant be taken for granted. HP also has a wholly-owned subsidiary in India, which appears to have been a larger beneficiary of its offshoring efforts in recent years. As far as Tech Mahindras interest in the company goes, Mphasis, with its large exposure to the banking and financial services sector, will be a good fit. This is a segment where Tech Mahindra has lagged behind peers, and the acquisition will increase its scale in the business to a respectable $1 billion.But having said that, the risk of paying too much and merger integration issues are areas of concern. Analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd say in an 8 February note, One of the key things a buyer would look at when considering MPHL is the margin that it makes in the Direct Channel versus HP channel... Based on our calculation, direct channel Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margins could be around 11% (nearly half of the HP Channel Ebit margins of around 20%).In most of the recent deals in the IT (information technology) services space, the target companies have had margins of around 20% and their portfolios have been far more diversified. As such, theres hardly any reason for paying a high premium for Mphasis over comparable deals such as iGate Corp.s acquisition of Patni Computer Systems Ltd.It seems the only way HP can extract good value is to commit to certain revenues via the HP channel for the next few years.

				In December, VW said it had agreed to buy back 20,000 vehicles and expected to fix another 60,000. The settlement documents show that if regulators do not approve fixes, the German automakers costs could jump dramatically.Under the settlement that must be approved by a US judge, owners of 3 litre vehicles who opt for fixes will get compensation of between $7,000 and $16,000 from Volkswagen if emissions fixes are approved in a timely fashionand the automaker will pay another $500 if the fix affects a vehicles performance. Owners who opt for a buyback will get $7,500 on top of the value of the vehicle.Also read: Volkswagen takes global sales crown from Toyota amid diesel crisisVolkswagen could be forced to pay as much as $4.04 billionand much more in individual owner compensationif regulators reject a fix entirely, according to the US Federal Trade Commission, which had sued VW and voted unanimously to back the deal.The settlement is the last major hurdle to Volkswagen moving beyond its emissions scandal, though it still faces suits from some US states and investors.Volkswagen Group of America chief executive Hinrich Woebcken said with the agreement, all owners of polluting diesels will have a resolution available to them.

-0.58,"New Delhi: As an organization, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is changing the way payments are made in the countryfrom launching a card payment settlement system that competes with Visa and MasterCard to setting up a platform to facilitate instant money transfer. 
				   
				The Reserve Bank of India-backed organization is preparing to launch the second version of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) called UPI 2.0 by early next year and is betting that the upgraded version will accelerate Indias movement towards a cashless economy. In an email interview, NPCI managing director and chief executive A.P. Hota spoke about the progress made and challenges encountered by UPI so far, and the latest milestones that have been set for the payment system. Edited excerpts:Since its launch, how many banks have taken to UPI technology?Twenty banks have launched UPI. Mobile apps of 17 banks are available on the Google play store.In the last one month, what are the challenges that have emerged with respect to UPI?The main challenge is awareness. Though media has played a splendid role, for making the customer to actually download the app and make use of the same, its required that the value proposition of the technology needs to be clearly explained.But we know that unlike social media apps, adoption of electronic payments would be slow.How much time does it take for any financial product to integrate UPI?It takes time. The simplest form of mobile payment is person-to-person payments. Merchant payment is complex and requires integration with banks as well as merchants payment system. Card payment is simple because the process is the same all over the world. Mobile payment processes are relatively new.Currently, how many UPI transactions have started to take place?On a daily basis, about 4,000 transactions are taking place from about 300,000 customers who have downloaded a UPI-based bank app.So, apart from the banks, how many other entities such as a payment gateway, have adopted UPI?Not many have, but we expect about 50 such merchants by the end of October integrated with UPI. In the next one year, what are the targets for UPIin terms of bank adoption, consumer traction and usage of UPI by other payment products?We expect 50 banks, 15 million customers, 100 merchants and around one million transactions as a peak day volume by March 2017.What is the strategy being used to counter the awareness challenge you earlier mentioned and to reach the targets mentioned above?Once we reach about 30 banks including State Bank of India and HDFC Bank, we will start an awareness campaign. We will also add new use cases of UPI technology such as merchant payments and bill payments. We have also planned a UPI version 2.0 for March 2017.What are some of the features that UPI 2.0 will have?UPI 2.0 will have enhanced features based on the feedback received from banks. For instance, specialized payments such as bill payments, insurance premium, EMI (equated monthly instalment) collection, etc. would be made very simple by seamless integration with BBPS (Bharat Bill Payments System).",2016-10-12,7L6ln4U6lTBzrNlRlM546M,"A.P.

The company doesnt report results for its wireless business separately anymore, and the India business is therefore the best proxy for it. 
				   
				Earlier, Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd had reported sequential revenue declines of around 2%, largely due to the seasonality factor. RCom said in a press statement that results for the quarter were impacted by an increase in competitive intensity, migration of CDMA customers to 4G LTE and seasonality factors. Its understandable that the migration attempt will result in some disruption. Average revenue per user rose 5% sequentially, suggesting a larger proportion of low-value customers have been lost. But overall, given the continued sluggishness, theres hardly anything for investors to get excited about. RCom shares have more than halved in the current year, and initial enthusiasm about the companys strategic deals with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd as well as its deleveraging plans has waned.All of the debt-reduction plans the company has talked about are still a work-in-progress and some of them are at fairly preliminary stages. And while the merger of its wireless business with Aircel Ltd may come through, the success of the deal depends largely on how successful the two are in raising a large amount of equity capital in the combined entity. And the current environment, where telecom stocks have fallen at a fast pace, is hardly conducive for raising equity. There is also lack of clarity about RComs arrangements with Reliance Jio for use of the latters 4G network, and how beneficial the deal will be.

				But while Infosys Ltd and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) have presented contrasting images of each other at times, together the two big Indian software exporters have held a mirror. Analysts have used them to view global spending on those invisible lines of computer code that enable large corporations to run themselves. No longer. The picture the duo are displaying now is more about how their own industry is at risk of being overrun by robots.Infosys operating margin 
Before last quarters results, Infosys was doing a relatively better job of gaining investor approval. This time last year, TCS shares enjoyed a 15% higher valuation than Infosys, based on analysts expectations of future earnings. By this week, that had turned into a small discount.Then on Thursday, TCS beat revenue and profit estimates for the June quarter, but operating margins shrank to 25%. Thats below the managements targeted range of 26% to 28%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Infosys, which reported on Friday, cut its sales forecast for the year. Worse still, its operating margin came in at just 24.1%, extending a nearly four-year decline in relative profitability for the Bangalore-based group.Two years ago, Infosys tapped SAP executive Vishal Sikka to take over from the founders, who all seemed bent on having a go at running the company before retirement. For a while, it looked like they might run it aground. But while Infosys has steadied under Sikka, its increasingly clear that the new normal for operating margins for both Infosys and TCS may be around 25%, and not the 29% to 31% that at least Infosys used to hit fairly regularly before its management merry-go-around left it dizzy.Profitability is now capped by robots, or, to be more specific, a combination of artificial intelligence, digital technologies, blockchain and other innovations that are challenging the traditional strategy of throwing people at complex software problems and charging clients for their time. But while the large Indian vendors are themselves investing in these new areas, so much of their legacy business depends on exploiting the price difference between techies in the West and in developing countries, its not clear if theyll be able to switch to a people-lite business model in time.For the top four Indian vendors, growth in total employment has slowed to 8% levels, from 106% in the year ended in March 2012. But nimbler challengers are threatening to nibble at juicy businesses faster than the Indian companies can slim down. For instance, UK-based start-up Thought Machine has created a new, blockchain-based core banking package that resides in the cloud and wont require expensive in-house data centers, according to a report this week in Artificial Intelligence Online. TCS has made two acquisitions of more than $500 million in value, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. The last was in 2014. Infosys hasnt done any of that size with its $5 billion in cash. TCS fell as much as 3.8% in Mumbai on Friday, while Infosys slumped almost 11%. The relative performance of the two is no longer much of an investment theme. Of far greater importance is how they take on those robots. Bloomberg

BP, which had in 2011 bought 30% interest in 21 exploration blocks of Reliance Industries for $7.2 billion, had cited investment of nearly $500 million in oil and gas exploration and production for gaining the licence.

-0.69,"Jakarta: Indonesia will exceed its coal production target for another year as miners cash in after prices recovered from a five-year collapse.
				   
				The worlds biggest exporter will produce about 489 million metric tonnes this year, 18% above the government-mandated target, according to energy ministry forecasts. Thats up from last years output estimated at 434 million tonnes and would be at least the third year in a row that the nation has produced more than it planned.Southeast Asias largest economy has been trying to cap its coal output in an attempt to preserve resources for future generations of Indonesians. Thats proving a challenge as resurgent prices tempt producers to maximize output from new and existing mines to meet demand at home and abroad.Actual annual production will generally be higher than targeted because prices are now higher, Bambang Gatot Ariyono, the director general of coal and mineral resources at the energy and mineral resources ministry, said Jan. 5. It compensates for previous losses.Coal more than doubled in 2016 after tumbling to the lowest in almost a decade as efforts by China to reduce excess supply pushed prices higher and faster than anyone anticipated. The recovery is breathing new life into an industry hammered by overcapacity and shrinking demand, reviving share prices of miners around the world, from Indonesias PT Bumi Resources to Australias Whitehaven Coal Ltd.A gauge of Indonesian mining companies surged more than 70% in 2016, dwarfing the 15% advance in the Jakarta Composite index. The gauge slumped 41% in 2015, its worst year since 2008.Production outlookBumi Resources, Indonesias biggest coal producer, expects to mine more than 90 million tonnes this year, compared with 86 million tonnes in 2016, corporate secretary Dileep Srivastava said in an e-mail. PT Adaro Energy, operator of the countrys largest mine, didnt provide estimates for 2017 but the company said in e-mail that it will continue to maintain production discipline and improve efficiency to grow the company sustainably in the long term.The government isnt willing to force companies to curtail output from newly constructed mines after granting them production licenses, according Ariyono from the energy ministry. We cant tell them to stop, he said.A growing share of Indonesias output is remaining in the country, with 25% of supply this year forecast to be consumed domestically, up from 21% in 2016 and 19 percent in 2015, according to energy ministry estimates. The government sees local demand at 121 million tons this year, up from an estimated 91 million tonnes in 2016, according to the data.Still, Indonesia exports most of what it mines, with China, India, South Korea, and Japan among its biggest customers. With international prices now showing signs of peaking, Indonesia isnt being complacent about the longevity of the rally, according to the countrys coal mining association.China balanceProducers view that current high prices cant be used as future reference, said Hendra Sinadia, deputy executive director of the Indonesian Coal Mining Association.Thermal coal in Indonesia climbed for a seventh month to $101.69 a metric ton in December, the highest since 2012 and the longest run of gains in data compiled by Bloomberg since 2009. Australias Newcastle coal more than doubled last year to almost $110 a ton in November, before slipping to about $84 this month.China, which produces and consumes more than any other country on the planet, has worked overtime to cool the market, reversing some output restrictions and encouraging more production before winter. The nations output rose in November to the highest level in a year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.China will re-balance between cutting production and meeting domestic demand, Sinadia said. They are doing this right now.Indonesias miners are also trying to wean themselves off China, with exports shrinking over the past three years. The nation accounted for almost 20 percent of Indonesias total overseas shipments in 2015, down from almost 31% in 2013, according to data from the state statistics agency. Over the same period, Indias coal purchases rose to 34 percent of Indonesias exports, from 28% in 2013, the data show.Diversified exposureWhen Bumi realized that China growth was showing signs of a slow down three to four years ago we proactively diversified into other markets such as India and developed a few new ones like Philippines, Bumi Resourcess Srivastava said. We prefer not to be overly exposed in any single market but to have a diversified market exposure.Indonesias exports to China may fall again in 2017 as rising domestic output erodes its appetite for imports, according to Michelle Leung, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.Exports will depend on the level of demand in the seaborne market, said Rory Simington, principal coal analyst at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. Indonesian producers have the flexibility to satisfy demand from China, India and rest of the seaborne market, provided the price is right. Bloomberg",2017-01-13,80hfIfrBjfXapHk7es4JsK,Southeast Asias largest economy has been trying to cap its coal output in an attempt to preserve resources for future generations of Indonesians,competitor,09:37,"Coals recovery too good to resist for Indonesia, the worlds biggest exporter"
0.53,"An Indian government agency helmed by a former civil servant sprang a surprise last week by suggesting that the trigger for renegotiating a port concession agreement to address stress facing a cargo contract should be erosion of net worth by 50% and two years of cash losses.
				   
				The suggestion by the National Shipping Board, led by former shipping secretary Vishwapati Trivedi, seeks to take forward a key recommendation made by the government-mandated Kelkar panel that was tasked with revisiting and revitalizing the public-private partnership (PPP) model of infrastructure.The National Shipping Board is the highest advisory body on matters related to Indian shipping and matters arising out of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958.While the panel headed by economist Vijay Kelkar laid down the broad framework for dealing with project stress and renegotiating a concession agreement without giving any scope for abuse and undeserved gains arising from such an exercise, it left a decision on what would constitute a trigger for stress and subsequent renegotiations for the government to define.The panel, in its report submitted to the government last November, suggested an Infrastructure PPP Project Review Committee (IPRC) and an Infrastructure PPP Adjudication Tribunal (IPAT) to be set up for dealing with the complexities involved in the renegotiation process.The National Shipping Board said it had proposed the trigger keeping in view the fact that a renegotiation should not be aimed at maintaining a required return on investment (which the Kelkar panel had also alluded to) and that the losses incurred by the project do not result in a compete erosion of its net worth.The National Shipping Boards recipe for a stress test to facilitate renegotiation is an accountants way of defining insolvency and mirrors the template followed by the soon-to-be redundant Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) while dealing with sick companies.By the time a projects net worth is eroded by 50% and it is running cash losses for two years, it becomes a terminally ill patient. At that stage, its too late to undergo a renegotiation. It doesnt work.A trigger mechanism cannot be measured in accounting terms.Generally speaking, a trigger mechanism should arise whenever a PPP project is unable to achieve materially what it has projected in its business plan at the time of placing the bid.For instance, if a cargo terminal designed to load iron ore becomes idle due to a ban on production and export of the commodity or if a power project is unable to import coal at the price factored in at the time of bidding, those become a trigger.Because, why should the shareholders fund losses of a project? Trigger is a forewarning that something has materially changed. If you wait for all these accounting symptoms to appear before deciding stress, it will fail miserably. Thats not the right way to deal with stress.BIFR had a different background origin. But, unlike the BIFR, the PPP project promoters may seek an external intervention at the first adverse turn facing the project.The BIFR definition of stress is good for a competitive business where there is no concession. For instance, a biscuit/noodle maker may post losses this year but may turn around next year.In such cases, interventions to deal with stress can wait till there is complete proof of erosion of competitive value/competitive power in the market.PPP in infrastructure is not a free market, it is a concession market and a concession market business model depends not on free business but on business endowed by a concession.PPPs in infrastructure refer to the provision of a public asset and service by a private partner who has been conceded the right (the concession) for the purpose, for a specified period of time, on the basis of market-determined revenue streams that allow for commercial return on investment.When an infrastructure project fails, the government fails and the public suffers. Then the shareholders also suffer. Given the public interest in infrastructure, a shareholder-based measurement of stress such as net worth erosion and cash losses may not be the right approach. Besides, the government is also a stakeholder in PPP projects. Basically, the trigger has to be pro-active without looking at it from a shareholders perspective.The objective of PPP is not to enrich a shareholder; he should also make returns commensurate with his risks. The erosion of net worth and cash losses cannot be the deciding factor for a remedial action because this takes into consideration only one stakeholder at the neglect of others.And, even if the interest of the private shareholder becomes paramount while deciding stress, it would be better not to wait for a stage till he bleeds. When a project faces a substantial variation, say about 20% from his original financial model, thats the time to intervene.BIFR, in any case, will soon fade into history once Indias Bankruptcy Code takes effect.P.

-0.21,"If the December and March quarter results of banks showed state-run lenders as weaklings and private banks as winners, the June quarter numbers separated the sector into three clear partsthe weak, the still vulnerable and the winners. Collectively, public sector banks continued to be the worst performers with bad loans doubling from a year ago and private banks were the winners after making reasonable profits.
				   
				The weaklings: Small and mid-sized public sector banks featured here with their gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) exceeding 11% of loan book. However, even some private banks saw bad loan ratios worsen. For instance, the GNPA ratio for Dhanlaxmi Bank Ltd rose to 7.02% from 6.36% in the March quarter. ICICI Bank Ltd, too, saw GNPA ratio rise for the third quarter to 5.87% but, given its strong capital position, it would be unfair to term it a weakling. Unlike ICICI Bank, small- and mid-sized public sector lenders have shrunk loan portfolios by refraining from fresh lending even as existing loans decayed at a faster pace. As loan books shrink and bad loans age, these banks will find it difficult to sustain themselves. Four state-run banksCentral Bank of India, Indian Overseas Bank, United Bank of India and UCO Bankhad a capital adequacy ratio a hairs breadth away from the regulatory minimum of 9.6%.The still vulnerable: Asset quality of the countrys largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI), stabilized as its gross bad loans rose by a modest 3.43%. It looks like much of the pain has passed for SBI, with GNPAs at 6.94% of total loans amid a huge decline of 70% in fresh slippages (new loans turning bad). But the lender has a watch list of Rs30,000 crore loans, estimating that 30% of these could turn bad. In the June quarter, Rs2,165 crore worth of slippages was from the watch list. In the private sector, Axis Bank Ltd, too, has a watch list of around Rs20,000 crore in loans. Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank and ICICI Bank, too, are vulnerable given the rise in bad loans.The winners: Clearly, the best of the pack are from the private sector. HDFC Bank Ltd continued to show strong asset quality by capping its bad loan ratio at a little above 1%. The lender delivered 20% growth in net profit and its net interest income, too, grew by a healthy 22%.

-0.48,"New Delhi: Everyone sees struggle, only the intensity differs, says Hari Das with a big smile. For Das, the intensity was always more than too much. 
				   
				Farming had left his family in debt, so his parents moved to Delhi from a village near Khajuraho in Madhya Pradesh in 1986, in the hope of making money. They started working as labourers for a construction site which was to become a part of the American Embassy School (in south  Delhis Chanakyapuri area), says Das, who was born in Delhi. Five years later, his father died of a brain tumour. It must have happened because of the weight he used to carry on his head every day, believes Das. The tumour was diagnosed at the last stage; even if it was detected earlier, we couldnt have done anything. Ma and pa used to earn Rs10 each a day, which was never enough to feed a family of five, says Das, who has two siblings. From then on, his mother was the sole earner. Das must have been three years old when his mother put him in a crèche, organized at the construction site by Mobile Creches, a Delhi-based non-profit that offers day care and education programmes for children of construction workers. Initially, I wasnt too keen but my mother insisted. Our house (in Sanjay Niwas slum) was 5 minutes away from the site, so I used to go to the crèche every day, along with my sister and brother at 2pm, study, eat and play games, recalls Das whose favourite part of the day was eating bananas offered at the crèche with the other 10 children. He continued going to the crèche even after joining a nearby government-run school at the age of 5. Our mother was very particular about education. She would work extra hours to ensure that we went to school, he says. Till the age of 10, Das used to spend his mornings at the crèche and the afternoons at the school.Mobile Creches helped too, with its scholarship scheme. Till sixth standard they offered Rs900 if we passed a year, from Class VI-X, it was Rs1,200 for passing each class, and Rs1,500 for the last two years, says Das. Each year, Das secured the scholarship, which helped him in his education and paid some expenses at home too. The crèche was removed after the completion of the construction. But another learning opportunity arose: as part of an initiative by the American Embassy School, children living in the slums were offered the chance to spend every Thursday with the children inside the school. He made the most of these visits. It was by interacting with those students and teachers that I learnt English, says Das, who used to spend most of his Thursdays in the computer activity room.He also started working at a dhaba, which fetched him Rs50 and two meals a day. My summer holidays were also spent working as a cleaner and waiter there. Those Thursdays continued till Das completed his Class XII. By then, he had decided to pursue a career in computers. Aware of his ambitions, one of the teachers at the American Embassy School helped Das secure admission in a computer learning centre at South Extension. After completing a one-year diploma in hardware, Das started working with Mobile Creches as part of its technical support team. While working there for three years, he did a six-month course in Linux as well as completed his bachelors in arts through correspondence from Delhi University. Those three years taught me lot about what I wanted to do with my life. Things at home also improved; my mother was no longer a daily wager (she had a fixed job as a construction worker with a company and earned Rs1,500 a month), says Das, who earned Rs7,000 a month at Mobile Creches. Das then applied to a few multinational firms through a job portal. After six months he got a job and is currently a senior engineer at IBM in Noida. Had I refused to go to that makeshift crèche that day, my life wouldnt have been the same, he says. Like Das, Mobile Creches has helped shape many a childs life. Within each centre, there are three separate classrooms: a creche, for children birth to 3 years; the balwadi, for the 3 to 5 year olds; and NFE (bridge-course section), for children 6 and older. The approach is promotive in the sense that it takes care of the age-appropriate developmental needs of the children across the three sections  Creche (0-3), Balwadi (3-6) and Non-Formal Education (NFE) (6+). Mobile Creches emphasizes early stimulation, culturally appropriate learning and the acquisition of psycho-social skills in children. A specially designed curricula for each age group helps in early learning aiming at holistic development of the child.Mobile Creches 8-hour programme, six days a week, for birth to 12 year olds provides an integrated package of age-appropriate health, nutritional and educational interventions. The non-profit, which provides services to more than 3,000 children a day across the country with the help of volunteers, has adopted a nutrition programme to tackle malnutrition.With the focus on under-threes, this programme has a provision of fresh, wholesome food and a balanced mix of nutrients. Children are fed three times a daymilk is provided to them and fruits, vegetables, eggs, cereals and pulses constitute the daily diet, to ensure a minimum of 500 calories for each child as nutrition supplementation. A special diet is given to all children with weights below normal. The under-3 under-weight children are frequently fed and given a high protein ready-to-use-therapeutic-food made by Mobile Creches staff at every centre, explains Mridula Bajaj, executive director of Mobile Creches, whose sponsors include KPMG, DLF Foundation, Roselle, Oracle, Plan, Unitech and PNB Housing Finance.Talking about the importance of donations, Bajaj says, Of course, every drop counts and every single contribution, big or small, helps in the development of these children. Like everyone else, they too have the right to a better future. Beyond the monetary help, it also helps sensitize people and bring more people into the fold to work towards ensuring a better life for everyone.Das, who continues to live in Sanjay Niwas slum, too wants to help a child create a better future. For him, things are very different today from what they were 26 years ago. He earns Rs35,000 a month, is married and has a one-year-old daughter; his brother is a chef at a five-star hotel while his sister is married, and his mother now stays at home. If you can give, then give.

-0.61,"San Francisco: Facebook Inc.s revenue topped analysts projections, boosted by video advertising and sales from Instagram. 
				   
				Third-quarter sales of the Mark Zuckerberg-led social media giant grew 56% to $7.01 billion, the company said Wednesday in a statement. That compared with analysts average estimate of $6.92 billion. The company drew 84% of its advertising revenue from mobile phones, unchanged from the prior quarter. Its the sixth straight quarterly revenue beat for Facebook, which has increased sales by more than 50% the past four quarters. As the company expands into new areas like virtual reality and mobile messaging, its consistent performance is tied to its main advertising business on mobile phones. Facebook expanded that business to Instagram, its photo-sharing application, which has started to contribute to the growth. So long as the core business remains as strong as it is, the overall thesis doesnt change muchthey have a ton of opportunity, Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie Securities, said before the earnings report. Mobile just continues to absolutely dominate for them. Gain in usersThe company increased its monthly active users 4.7% from the previous quarter to 1.79 billion, topping analysts estimates of 1.76 billion. Daily users rose to 1.18 billion. The company doesnt break out Instagrams sales, but the apps advertising revenue is growing faster than for Facebooks main product, David Wehner, the chief financial officer, said in an interview. Still, Facebooks app was the bigger contributor to sales growth in the quarter, he said. Its the continued strength of advertiser demand, Wehner said of what drove the quarter. Were seeing strength across all geographies, market segments and verticals. Facebook, based in Menlo Park, California, was unchanged in extended trading, after declining 1.8% to close at $127.17 in New York. The shares have increased 22% this year. Investment areasChief executive officer Zuckerberg is taking advantage of Facebooks blockbuster ad growth to spend in other areas, like virtual reality and connecting the world to the Internetbets that may not contribute to financial performance for a decade or two. Meanwhile, in addition to Instagram, the company has two chat apps, Messenger and WhatsApp, with more than 1 billion users each. Facebook is testing models for making money from the properties, such as letting users talk to businesses to book trips or send flowers. The company is driving the growth in digital advertising spending, along with Alphabet Inc.s Google. The companies captured 68% of digital ad spend in the first half of this year, an increase from 61% a year ago, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a non-profit industry group.The two companies are capturing the equivalent to all of the growth in the industry and then some, leaving crumbs for everyone else to fight for, said Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group. Its kind of boring at this point. Profit, excluding some items, was $1.09 a share, compared with analysts estimates of 97 cents. The company reported net income of $2.38 billion, or 82 cents a share, from $896 million, or 31 cents, a year earlier.

-0.22,"Xiaomi Corp.s international chief Hugo Barra has quit after a turbulent four years during which the Chinese smartphone maker rose to the top of its home market before local rivals mimicked its model and dethroned the brand.
				   
				The former Google executive is returning to Silicon Valley after being hired with much fanfare in 2013 to be Xiaomis global face, becoming a fixture on the conference circuit and the up-and coming vendors main pitchman to foreign audiences. In a Facebook post Monday, Barra said it was time for him to return home to embark on a new adventure, without elaborating. Senior vice-president Xiang Wang will oversee global operations after Barra departs in February, after the Lunar New Year holidays.Barra was given the task of taking Xiaomi global, helping the company make inroads into India, where sales topped $1 billion for the first time in 2016. During his tenure, it briefly became Chinas biggest smartphone vendor by packing high-end components into inexpensive devices and building a vibrant online community of users. But local brands such as Oppo, Vivo and Huawei Technologies Co. rapidly copied its moves and developed more innovative competitive tactics.ALSO READ: Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 camera proves it isnt only about the megapixelsHugo was a key figure for Xiaomi in the early days because he helped overseas marketing, said Kitty Fok, managing director of IDC China. Barras departure is likely to have limited impact because Xiaomis position in India has stabilized and the task has shifted to growing market share, said Fok.His exit may indicate that Xiaomi is re-focusing on its home market, said Nicole Peng, an analyst at Canalys. Barra will be departing Beijinga city infamous for hazardous air pollutionjust as Xiaomi is struggling to find its footing at home. What Ive realized is that the last few years of living in such a singular environment have taken a huge toll on my life and started affecting my health, Barra wrote in his post. Seeing how much Ive left behind these past few years, it is clear to me that the time has come to return.Xiaomi was last valued at $45 billion in 2014, making it one of the worlds largest startups. It drew comparisons to Apple Inc. after doubling revenue that year and climbing to the top of the Chinese smartphone market . Its since struggled, missing its 2015 shipments target and falling behind Oppo and Huawei. The company is aiming for 100 billion yuan ($14.5 billion) in revenue this yearthe same target it had set as far back as 2015.Since that valuation in 2014, analysts have questioned its price tag given a sliding market position. In a memo posted on his WeChat account, billionaire co-founder Lei Jun said his company had tried to grow too rapidly in past years and missed opportunities.Its had more success in India, where it grew shipments 150% last year. Chinese brands account for 51% of Indias smartphone shipments in November, according to Counterpoint Research. Xiaomi is now counting on the country to drive its next phase of growth: it already assembles over three-quarters of its Indian smartphones in the country under the governments Make in India program.Yet despite that success, Xiaomis most important market by far remains its home country, where it may be preparing a comeback.Xiaomi realized the Chinese smartphone market will be their top priority, Peng said. India was the only shining point for Xiaomis overseas expansion over the years, and entering the US market will not be easy because the market is strongly held by Apple and Samsung.Xiaomi secured $1.1 billion in 2014 from investors including GIC Pte., All-Stars Investment Ltd and DST. Executives have since said repeatedly that it isnt on the hunt for financing, while deflecting speculation about an initial public offering. Apart from phones, the company also sells other types of electronic gadgets and appliances, from air purifiers to robot vacuums, made by what it calls its ecosystem-partners. Sales through such manufacturing and branding partners exceeded 15 billion yuan in 2016, Lei has said.As much as we would love to have Hugo stay with us in Beijing for a much longer time, we understand his personal challenges and wish him all the best in his future endeavors, co-founder Lin Bin wrote in a comment on Barras Facebook post.

-0.9,"Ousted Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry was pushing C. Sivasankaran, who had played dealmaker in several Tata group transactions in the past, to pay up the Siva groups share of the DoCoMo award, and also discussed with the board of the holding company possible legal action against the sometimes controversial, Seychelles-based entrepreneur, documents seen by Mint show.
				   
				On 15 September, at his penultimate Tata Sons board meeting as chairman, Mistry raised this issue, the documents show. He was removed as chairman when the board next met on 24 October.Interestingly, on 19 September, Tata Sons (Tata Teleservices Ltd and NTT DoCoMo Inc. are named as co-respondents) received a legal notice from a firm retained by Sivasankarans Sterling Info-tech Ltd, alleging mismanagement of Tata Teleservices and reserving the right to seek damages to recover its (Sterlings) losses.Mint learns that a decision on how to respond to this email had not been taken till Mistrys exit.Tata group spokesperson Debasis Ray said in an email response to Mints queries that in 2008, when Docomo agreed to acquire shares of Tata Teleservices, Tata Sons voluntarily offered other shareholders of TTSL an opportunity for a pro-rata sale of their holdings. This was subject to the shareholders agreeing to bear a pro-rata portion of any claims or amounts payable to Docomo should such an event arise.... Thereafter in 2014, Docomo exercised the put option. In terms of the agreement with the selling shareholders, Tata Sons demanded from Mr Sivasankaran his pro-rata share of the amount payable to Docomo.Ray added that Tata Sons is pursuing all legal options for recovery of this amount.Mint couldnt ascertain whether the company had responded to Sivasankarans notice. Sivasankaran could not be reached for comment immediately.The notice from Sivasankarans law firm mentions his long-standing association with the Tata Group of Companies on account of his close association with Mr Ratan Tata.Sivasankaran has had several dealings with the group, taking Barista, Indias first coffee chain that the Tata group had acquired, off its hands, selling Dishnet DSL to the Tata-owned VSNL, which subsequently became Tata Communications, and facilitating the sale of the Tata stake in the Birla-Tata-AT&T telecom venture to the Aditya Birla Group, resulting in the formation of Idea Cellular Ltd.In early 2006, the Siva group acquired 520 million shares in Tata Teleservices at Rs 17 per share or Rs884 crore. It paid Rs102 crore towards this, the documents show. It paid the balance in February 2006. Of the Rs782 crore, the documents show that Rs650 crore was funded by a loan from Standard Chartered Bank effectively guaranteed by Tata Sons. The balance Rs132 crore came from Kalimati Investments, a subsidiary of Tata Steel.Ray confirmed both and said that to ensure that in the event of a default on the repayment of the loan, the shares of Tata Teleservices were not sold to a third party, Tata Sons agreed to an arrangement whereby the bank would sell the shares to Tata Sons.He added that a part of the consideration was funded by another Tata company for a few days on market-linked terms.In 2006, when the loan was refunded, the Tata group withdrew this guarantee, and the Siva group had to provided other collateral to the bank, the documents show.Then came the 2008 deal with DoCoMo under which the latter bought shares amounting to 26% of Tata Teleservices equity. Of the 26%, 20% was to be fresh equity and 6%, a sale by existing shareholders. Under this, the documents with Mint show, Sivasankaran sold 20.74 million shares at Rs117.81 apiece, turning a tidy profit.The DoCoMo investment eventually turned sour, and with no initial public offering in sight, the Japanese company exercised a put option. The resulting litigation led to an award of Rs8,450 crore to DoCoMo. Of this, the Siva groups share was Rs694 crore.The September legal notice from the Siva group and a letter to Mistry in October 2013 from Sivasankaran refer to Tata Teleservicess dire need for equity, and present the Siva groups investment in the company as a sort of lifeline.This representation was disputed by Mistry in his response to the letter. I have been advised by Mr (Ratan) Tata that the investment made by the Siva Group was made principally on the consideration that the telecom sector was fast-growing and represented a good investment opportunity. In his letter, Sivasankaran referred to an earlier letter to Ratan Tata in 2011 seeking assistance in finding a buyer for the Siva groups holding in Tata Teleservices.He further asks Mistry for a fair resolution (presumably a buyback of his holdings) in line with the mutually benevolent relation between the Tata group and Siva group which made the Siva group walk the extra miles to support the Tata group by undertaking risks which no financial investor acting in self-interest would.From Rays comments, it looks like that resolution is headed for the courts.",2016-11-09,8UuRA0q7zaqX07hXw3QxPL,"At his penultimate Tata Sons board meeting as chairman, Cyrus Mistry raised the issue, the documents show",competitor,01:31,Cyrus Mistry was trying to get Siva group to pay share of DoCoMo award
0.39,"Mumbai: National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), the developer of the interface that allows customers to transfer money across banks, has asked ICICI Bank Ltd to reverse a decision to block transactions from Flipkarts payments app PhonePe. 
				   
				NPCI gave a clean chit to PhonePe, an app based on the unified payments interface (UPI), in a press statement released on Thursday evening after a review and discussions with ICICI Bank and Yes Bank Ltd, the banker to PhonePe. We would like to state that ICICI Bank has been advised to open UPI transactions immediately, NPCI said in the statement. We have also advised banks to adhere to the merchant on-boarding guidelines meticulously from the angle of interoperability of merchant app so that such disputes are avoided.NCPIs statement comes in response to concerns raised by ICICI Bank regarding transactions done on PhonePe. The bank said that the creation of @ybl virtual payment address that Phone Pe uses violates the interoperability rules of the UPI platform.ICICI blocks PhonePe transactions in sign of banks moving to protect payments turfAn ICICI Bank spokesperson said NPCI had given the bank a written assurance that PhonePe will allow interoperability. As soon as this is corrected, ICICI Bank will start allowing UPI transactions to resume on this app, the spokesperson said. ICICI Bank is one of the 10 promoters of NPCI and owned 7.47% of its shares as on 22 January 2016, according to the Watal committee report. In September, NPCI said it had broad-based its shareholding to include 46 new banks, but didnt specify what the new shareholding structure is.Yes Bank defended PhonePe in a statement to stock exchanges, stating that the app had complied with all the rules laid down by NCPI. All member banks who are offering UPI services have undergone exactly the same process and were allowed to go live only after complying with the same process, said Yes Bank.On Sunday, the lender said it had temporarily blocked transactions originating from PhonePe, pending the resolution of its concerns related to restrictive practices followed by the app. This entity is following restrictive practices allowing users to make payments with only its UPI handle, which is in contravention to the UPI guidelines of interoperability and choice that empowers a customer to choose any app to make payments through UPI, an ICICI spokesperson said.Flipkarts PhonePe crosses 10 million downloads on Google Play StorePhonePes co-founder and chief executive officer Sameer Nigam took to Twitter on 14 January to allege that ICICI was abruptly blocking its customers from using the app. Separately, in an open letter released on Tuesday, the company said that more than 20,000 UPI transactions amounting to more than Rs5 crore by value had failed after ICICI Banks action. We followed all the detailed guidelines and procedures laid down by NPCI for an app to go live on UPI. We went through over a 100+ use case test cases, detailed certification, vulnerability assessment, penetration testing and third-party application security testing, before NPCI gave us permission to go live. PhonePe has been live since August 2016 and none of these issues have been raised earlier, PhonePe clarified in its letter.PhonePe said in its letter it wasnt fully compliant with NPCIs Android Intent Calls guidelines, but added that the deadline for compliance was 31  January. It also pointed out that other UPI apps including Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) have not been updated to meet these guidelines. These guidelines state that when a payment is to be made, an app will initiate an intent call to other UPI apps present on a mobile device. PhonePe declined to comment on Thursday, saying it had not got any official communication from NPCI yet. This is the second instance of a commercial bank blocking transactions arising from non-bank mobile wallet and payment services companies. On 4 January, CNBC-TV18 reported that State Bank of India (SBI) had blocked net banking transactions with e-wallet companies, although it allowed customers to top up their mobile wallets with debit and credit cards. At that time, SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya had said that service was blocked because of security concerns.Since the government decided to ban Rs500 and Rs1,000 currency notes on 8 November, it has announced several measures to encourage cashless transactions including waiving off debit card transaction fees to offering discounts for using digital payments to buy fuel. The biggest beneficiaries of this move have been digital payment firms and wallet operators.

0.22,"Medium and heavy commercial vehicles (trucks) hit a roadblock in June, with sales growth falling below expectations.
				   
				Add to this, the rentals commanded by trucks on key routes dipped for the first time in 21 months.Tata Motors Ltd, the market leader in commercial vehicles, reported a significant 11% year-on-year (y-o-y) drop in June sales.This came after a 23% y-o-y rise in May.Further, even sales of the second biggest truck manufacturer Ashok Leyland Ltd were a mere 8% higherboth in May and Junewhen compared with a year ago.Analysts hope that this slowdown is the result of scorching growth rates in the earlier months when pent-up demand pushed up trucks sales.Most say that it is a temporary blip. They believe the monsoon would have affected some distribution logistics, too.But whats more surprising is the inability of truckers to pass on the hike in diesel prices to customers. Freight rates on even arterial routes such as Delhi-Mumbai-Delhi fell by 1.5% on 1 July, in spite of two rounds of hikes in diesel prices. The industry was expecting a 2.75-3.25% hike in rentals. According to the Indian Foundation of Transport Research and Training, the arrival of fruits and vegetables was 15% lower this season. Meanwhile, demand for transport from sectors such as cement, fertilizers and timber was also disappointing. Sadly, the so-called green shoots of recovery are yet to seep into the core sectors.A months drop or stagnation in rentals is not bothersome, unless it continues.

				Just a year ago, SoftBank Group Corp.s founder looked poised to fulfil his long-stated plan of stepping aside in his 60s. He had a global telecom empire, track record of spectacularly successful investments and a bright young successor. Instead, the 59-year-old edged aside his heir apparent, cut the biggest deal of his career yet and revealed on Friday his ambition to become one of the worlds most powerful investors.SoftBank said it is forming a new fund to put as much as $100 billion in the global technology industry in the next five years, partnering with Saudi Arabias public investment fund to find companies that will become influential in the future. By comparison, all the venture capital funds in the world disbursed a record $129.5 billion in funding in 2015, according to CB Insights.The man who once proclaimed his goal of creating the worlds most valuable company isnt hiding his ambition: Over the next decade, he aims to be the biggest investor in technology.In other words, Japans second-richest man isnt going anywhere. Son in 2014 brought in Nikesh Arora, luring the former Google executive with a pay package that rivaled those of Apple Inc.s Tim Cook and Walt Disney Co.s Bob Iger. He spent two years grooming him as a successor only to change his mind in June. A month later SoftBank announced plans for a $32 billion takeover of chip designer ARM Holdings Plc, Sons biggest bet to date and a wager on the future of interconnected devices.For some time, it seemed like Son has fatigued, considering retirement and bringing in Arora. It is pretty clear now that he is still full of zeal, said Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive officer of Myojo Asset Management Co.It is not yet clear who will call the shots at what is tentatively named SoftBank Vision Fund and the Japanese company declined to comment further, noting the fund had not yet closed. SoftBank named Rajeev Misra, its head of strategic finance, to lead the project.Son has made tens of billions in returns from investments in companies including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, Yahoo and Supercell Oy, and the new fund will likely pursue a similar strategy of backing technology companies at all stages. While Arora was SoftBanks president, the company had plans to put about $3 billion into startups each year.During his two year tenure, Arora spearheaded investments in Indian e-commerce provider Snapdeal.com, ride-hailing service Ola Cabs, real-estate website Housing.com and hotel-booking app Oyo Rooms. In October 2015, SoftBank led a $1 billion fund-raising round for US-based online lender Social Finance Inc.Over the next decade, the SoftBank Vision Fund will be the biggest investor in the technology sector, Son, chairman and chief executive officer of SoftBank, said in a statement Friday. We will further accelerate the information revolution by contributing to its development.The Saudi government will consider putting money into the fund and become the lead investment partner, SoftBank said in the statement. The Tokyo-based company, which will invest as much as $25 billion, signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with the Saudis, who may put in as much as $45 billion over the next five years. Other large global investors may participate to increase the pool to $100 billion.Also Read: SoftBank tech fund to invest up to $100 billion with Saudi ArabiaSoftBank said that the fund will be reflected on its consolidated financial statements, without giving further details. Its shares rose as much as 3.7% in Tokyo. The stock had gained 5.8% this year before today, compared with a 12% decline in the benchmark Nikkei 225 index.The company is stepping up investment activity even though it has more than $100 billion in debt. SoftBank has relied on borrowing and earnings from its domestic telecom operations to pay for investments in start-ups in India, US and China while balancing losses at its US subsidiary Sprint Corp. By tapping outside investors, Son will be able to cut more ambitious deals than he could on his own.Also Read: SoftBanks robot Pepper gets to work at Taiwan bankARM acquisition has brought Son to a limit of how much he can invest just with SoftBanks balance sheet, Myojos Kikuchi said.The companys high-speed Internet and wireless services in Japan generated 1.16 trillion yen ($11.2 billion) of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the fiscal year ended 31 March. SoftBank has 3.5 trillion yen of bonds maturing in the next five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Its conceivable that after capturing the core of the Internet of Things with ARM, Son will next look to other semiconductors, electronic components and software, said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute in Tokyo. SoftBank has a proven track record of investment successes.

0.68,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond rose to 6.43% on Wednesday, from its previous close of 6.407%. While the finance minister was making the budget speech in Parliament, the bond yield actually dropped to 6.38%, but rose later.
				   
				The reason behind the drop was confusion about the exact size of the net government borrowing in fiscal 2018. Initially, the figure was quoted as Rs3.48 trillion against the current fiscal years Rs4.07 trillion. However, the comparison is not entirely correct as the 2018 figure does not take into account the buyback of bonds.ALSO READ | Budget 2017 gives clues about demonetisation deposits in banksAfter adjusting for buyback of bonds, the net borrowing programme in 2018 would be virtually unchangedRs3.48 trillion vs 3.47 trillion. And, without the adjustments, the comparable figures are Rs4.23 trillion in 2018 vs Rs4.07 trillion in 2017. The gross annual borrowing remains virtually unchanged at around Rs5.8 trillion. Once the mathematics was clear to the market, bond yields rose.It could be a knee-jerk reaction as ultimately, the market cannot ignore the good newsthe government is determined to contain the fiscal deficit at 3.2% of Indias gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018. This has also given rise to the hope of a rate cut in the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBI) next monetary policy on 8 February.Indeed, the fiscal discipline brightens the chances for a rate cut next week but I would still say its not a given as yetthe chance of a rate cut next week is 50:50. There could be a rate cut in coming months but it may or may not materialize next week.ALSO READ | A remarkably restrained Union budget, going by the numbersApart from the containment of fiscal deficit at 3.2% of GDP, the other factor that could influence the Monetary Policy Committee (which will have a new memberdeputy governor in charge of monetary policy Viral Acharya) that takes the call on interest rate is the drop in retail inflation to 3.41% in December from 3.63% in the previous month and 5.61% a year ago.Food inflation, which accounts for more than half of the consumer price index or CPI basket, is the driving factor and we may not see inflation going down further from here. The external factors which prevented RBI from going in for a rate cut in December have worsened since then and the impact of the so-called demonetisation is still not clear.In other words, the reasons cited by the six-member MPC for RBI for deciding against a rate cut in December are very much there and it can once again refrain from cutting the rate at its next meeting.At the first meeting of MPC in October, RBI brought down its policy rate to 6.25%.ALSO READ | Union Budget 2017: Key highlights and themesThe other reason behind a likely decision against any rate cut could be the liquidity-driven monetary transmission. Flooded with money post-demonetization, some of the banks have pared their benchmark rates by as much as 90 basis points in January. One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. Much of the money that flowed into the banking system in November and December is in the form of low-cost current and savings accounts. Banks do not pay any interest on current accounts and most pay 4% on savings accounts. With no sign of corporate credit picking up, banks have cut their loan rates for mortgages aggressively.It is for certain though that RBI will continue with its accommodative monetary policy stance. And, of course, there could be a surprise in the form of a rate cutlike the market experience in December when the MPC chose not to go for a rate cut against the consensus estimate.Tamal Bandyopadhyay, consulting editor at Mint, is adviser to Bandhan Bank.

0.53,"Frankfurt/Tokyo: Volkswagen AG dethroned Toyota Motor Corp. last year to become the worlds best-selling automaker for the first time, propelled by surging demand in China which has been largely unaffected by the diesel-cheating scandal.
				   
				Volkswagen sold a record 10.3 million vehicles in 2016, outpacing its rival with a 3.8% gain from a year earlier. Toyotas global sales, including its Hino Motors Ltd and Daihatsu Motor Co. units, rose 0.2% to 10.2 million vehicles in 2016, the Japanese automaker said on Monday.Taking the global sales crown marks the bittersweet culmination of an aggressive expansion that former chief executive officer Martin Winterkorn kick-started 10 years ago. While surging demand in China and the popularity of the upscale Audi and Porsche brands lineups boosted worldwide deliveries, the VW marque lost market share in Europe, its second-biggest region, following revelations in 2015 that the company manipulated diesel engines to pass emissions tests.ALSO READ: News in numbers | Volkswagen to recall 6 lakh faulty premium Audi cars from USVW group deliveries last year rose 12.2% in China, where the scandal is a non-issue because the automaker sells almost no diesel vehicles there. Sales in Europe gained 4%, less than the overall sector, while the crisis fallout hurt demand in the US and recessions cut sales in Russia and South America.The increase in sales tax on small-engine vehicles is set to weigh on deliveries this year in China, Volkswagens biggest national market, while in Germany, its home country, the namesake VW brand has started scaling back its large leasing fleet for employees, slowing growth. The marque accounted for almost 6 million of global group deliveries last year, and its targeting more than 3 million car sales in China this year.Toyotas sales last year lagged behind Volkswagen mainly due to its performance in the US and China, with demand for its flagship Camry sedan waning in the US and sales in China expanding at a slower pace than the overall market. Looking ahead, Toyota must contend with possible trade tensions as US President Donald Trump pressures foreign automakers to make more cars and trucks in the US.The development of the US market is set to decide if VW can stay ahead of Toyota this year, Sascha Gommel, a Frankfurt-based analyst at Commerzbank AG, said by phone. If the Chinese and European markets continue to be solid and the US market weakens as I expect, VW might stay first in 2017 as Toyota has a larger exposure to North America.Since his inauguration, Trump has withdrawn the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade accord, reaffirmed a campaign promise to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement involving Mexico and met with automakers to persuade them to keep production within the US.ALSO READ: Toyota planning a made-for-India hybrid car in five yearsToyota will invest $10 billion in the US over the next five years, maintaining its pace of spending during the last half decade, joining other manufacturers with highlighting projects in response to pressure from Trump to create jobs in America. After criticizing Toyotas plans to build a Corolla plant in Mexico, Trump rebuked Japan last week for sending the US hundreds of thousands of cars from what he said were the biggest ships Ive ever seen.Trump is a bigger risk for Toyota than for Volkswagen because the German carmaker has a small exposure to the US market, said Ken Miyao, an analyst at Tokyo-based market researcher Carnorama. Toyota has made investment to build a new plant in Mexico and will have limited options to appeal to Trump.As part of a far-reaching overhaul under new division chief Herbert Diess, the VW brand has embarked on a restructuring push outside China and will boost its lineup of sport utility vehicles, the industrys fastest-growing segment, where it lags behind Toyota and General Motors. Growth in China in recent years had masked weak returns in Europe and an ill-fated product strategy in Brazil, a former VW stronghold. In a US. comeback push, its rolling out the Atlas mid-size SUV and smaller Tiguan crossover with a longer wheelbase.The VW brand in Europe still largely depends on the Golf hatchback and Passat sedan and station wagon, models in market segments that are being squeezed as customers shift to SUVs. It has revamped the Golf to stabilize sales, and that vehicles decline has been partly offset by surging demand for the updated Tiguan SUV.VW executives have become tight-lipped about sales-volume targets as the companys focus shifts toward safeguarding profits and preparing for a future where vehicle ownership becomes less relevant as ride-hailing and car-sharing gain in popularity.Our new strategy through 2025 doesnt include any sales targets any more, Dietmar Voggenreiter, sales chief at VWs premium-car unit Audi said in an interview this month. These times are over. Bloomberg",2017-01-30,9eX4wmiq6DXRXgrrWyhKNI,"Volkswagen sold a record 10.3 million vehicles in 2016, outpacing its rival Toyota with a 3.8% gain from a year earlier",competitor,17:40,Volkswagen takes global sales crown from Toyota amid diesel crisis

				Net profit stood at Rs2,441.82 crore, as against Rs3,018.13 crore a year earlier, marginally lower than estimates. According to a Bloomberg poll of 20 analysts, the bank was expected to post a net profit of Rs2,466.7 crore for the quarter.The earnings are in line with expectations, said Siddharth Purohit, senior research analyst with brokerage firm Angel Broking Ltd. Earnings will remain muted for next couple of quarters.ICICI Bank shares fell 0.7% to Rs268.95 on Tuesday, paring this years gains to 5.4%. Earnings were announced after the markets closed. The S&P BSE Bankex Index has gained 7.5% this year.The lenders gross bad loans ballooned to Rs37,716. 73 crore at the end of December, rising 17.21% from the quarter ago. As a percentage of total loans, gross bad loans stood at 7.9% at the end of December, up from 6.82% at the end of the previous quarter. Bad loans net of provisions were 4.35% of advances. During the three months ended December, Rs 7057 crore worth of fresh loans turned bad, lower than the previous two quarters. About 40% of these were from a so-called watchlist the bank released in March. ICICI Banks managing director and chief executive officer Chanda Kochchar said the watch list, which includes sub-investment grade loans given to troubled sectors, declined to Rs.27,536 crore at the end of December from Rs 44,065 crore nine months earlier. Around Rs 12,057 crore worth of loans from the watch list went bad and Rs 4165 crore worth of loans were resolved during the last nine months.Rise in bad loans had a dampening effect on net interest income in the quarter, Hatim Broachwala, an analyst at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities told Bloomberg. The banks ability to prevent any further deterioration in asset quality in the slowing economy is going to be the key to profit growth in coming quarters.Net interest income (NII), or the core income a bank earns by giving loans, fell by 1.64% to Rs5,363.35 crore as loan growth slowed owing to the effects of demonetisation and the rise in bad loans.At the end of December, ICICI Banks advances rose 5.21% to Rs4.57 trillion.To be sure, ICICI Bank is not the only bank bearing the brunt of rising bad loans and slowing advances. Earlier in January, HDFC Bank Ltd reported its weakest quarterly profit growth in at least 20 years. Rival Axis Bank Ltd said net profit for the December quarter fell 73.4% while its gross bad loans ratio jumped by 1 percentage point over the last three months.It is very difficult to give any guidance on resolution of stressed assets as there are too many moving parts involved, Kochhar said on a conference call with reporters. Our endeavour is to resolve as much as we can in this year itself.ICICI Banks non-interest income fell 6.61% from a year ago to Rs 3938. 31 crore. However, this was largely because the bank booked a one-time income of Rs 1243 crore on sale of shareholding in ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co Ltd in the December 2015 quarter. Provisions and contingencies too dropped by 61.7% to Rs2,712.70 //crore//.

				The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), on its part, has also been goading people to use electronic modes of payments.Such usage will alleviate pressure on the physical currency and also enhance the experience of living in the digital world, RBI had said on Saturday.Is India ready to go fully cashless then? The short answer is no. The long answer, is slightly more nuanced, but still a no. A look at the cashless payment infrastructure tell us why this is so.As of 30 September, the number of point of sale (PoS) devices, which accepted debit and credit cards as modes of payments at merchant outlets, was only 1.49 million, RBIs monthly bulletin shows. Still, the number is higher than the 1.38 million reported on 31 March. These outlets include railway stations, airports, hospital counters and supermarkets.In comparison, Indians had nearly 730 million debit cards and 27 million credit cards at September end. It isnt clear, however, how many people have more than one card.These debit cards in the system also include about 200 million RuPay cards linked to over 250 million bank accounts under the Prime Ministers Jan Dhan Yojana. So far, about 24% of Jan Dhan accounts have zero balance, as reported by the financial inclusion movements website. And, according to a 13 September report by The Indian Express, 18 public sector banks and their 16 regional rural subsidiaries had just over 10 million accounts with only Rs1 in them, as bankers try to cut down the number of zero balance accounts under them.An even better indicator would be the money that is spent at these terminals. According to RBI data, people used debit cards to make nearly 1.2 billion transactions worth Rs1.6 trillion across India in FY16.While the transactions and amount may seem high, India also used debit cards to make over 8 billion transactions worth Rs 25.37 trillion at automated teller machines (ATMs) during that period. These were mostly cash withdrawals and some transfers made to other accounts and credit card bills.Credit cards recorded 785 million transactions on PoS terminals, where an amount of over Rs2.4 trillion was spent. It is clear then that India is largely using its plastic cards to withdraw cash, which it spends later.Mobile wallets, where services such as Paytm, Mobikwik and Ola Money offer ease of transaction to customers are still in the starting phase of adoption as only around one-fifth of Indias population has a smartphone where these services can be used. According to GSMA Intelligence, a mobile operator database, there were about 275 million smartphones in India as of June.RBIs monthly bulletin points out mobile wallets were used to make 604 million transactions in FY16 by customers who spent about Rs20.6 billion. Mobile bankingor transactions done via applications provided by banks to transfer money, pay utility bills and check balancesrecorded 390 million transactions worth over Rs4 trillion. Unified Payments Interface (UPI), the National Payments Corporation of Indias (NPCIs) ambitious payments interface which enables person-to-person transactions without the need to exchange sensitive bank account information is yet to fully take off. While NPCI has been able to sign up 26 banks to the UPI platform, which went live in August, the number of downloads and transactions hasnt picked up. Only about 20-25% of all transactions that happen in India are cashless. With this demonetization drive, we should see this rising and people opting for mobile wallets more. However, it is true the infrastructure for acceptance is still an issue that needs to be overcome. Possibly, this would be the time for improving that, said Karthik Srinivasan, senior vice-president, ICRA Ltd.Another factor that works against cashless transactions is the perceived security problems. Last month, details of about 32 million cards were likely to have been compromised due to a security breach in an ATM network. This led to State Bank of India (SBI) issuing 600,000 new cards to customers who could have been victims of this.

				As some of the finer points of the Code get clarified, before it takes effect at the end of the year, there is speculation around how it will be implemented in a market like India, which is famously known for its slow resolution rate.At a panel discussion at the Mint conference on Bankruptcy ActImpact of the new law on the banking landscape, held on 24 October, industry professionals, law professionals and stressed asset consultants came together to discuss the Code, and the opportunities and challenges associated with it. As divorce is important for marriage, I think insolvency resolution is important for investments, whether Indian or foreign capital, said Cyril Suresh Shroff, managing partner at Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas. According to Shroff, the impact of the bankruptcy code will be widely positive, leading to a better management of stressed companies in India. M.R. Umarji, a member of the Bankruptcy Law Committee set up by government, believes that while the code bestows significant powers on the legal system to deal with stressed companies, the intended effect is that there will be better financial discipline among companies, which will work to ensure that all their creditors are paid on time. Abizer Diwanji, partner and national leader, financial services and restructuring services, EY India, said, About 70% of our banking business is government-led. They have restraints in the way that they can make rational decisions in a timely manner. The law says that in 270 days there has to be a decision or the company goes into liquidation, but that does not mean that in 270 days there will be a rational decision.Rashesh Shah, chairman and chief executive officer at Edelweiss Finance, is of the view that the lending system in India has entered into yet another zone of conflict between the lenders and the borrowers. According to him, back in the late 80s and early 90s, when infrastructure lenders were faced with high non-performing assets (NPAs), they would convert a significant chunk of their debt into equity and then make huge returns a few years later. Back then, the lenders won the tug of war.In the era of corporate debt restructuring (CDR) and other debt recast mechanisms, lenders have ended up taking haircuts while the equity holders didnt feel much of the pinch. Shah believes that the equity holders or the borrowers had won that round. With the bankruptcy code coming into the picture, the powers have once again come into the hands of lenders as they are far above equity holders in the payout structure that the code mandates in a liquidation situation, said Shah.The bark is more important than the bite. As a practitioner I would never like to get into a situation of resolution under this Act, but I think it is desirable that we would be outside this or before this is invoked, said Vishakha Mulye, executive director, ICICI Bank.As a system, Mulye said, everyone must work together to demonstrate that resolution and liquidation can be done in an effective and efficient manner, if there has to be a future for the bankruptcy code. However, not everyone is convinced that India has done enough to move the stressed asset situation in the right direction.Anurag Das, founder and managing partner at Rain Tree Capital Singapore, is measured in his optimism. Some of the best practices around the world need to come to this market too, he said, adding that a very hands-on approach has to be taken to ensure that a turnaround takes place.According to Das, even though his optimism is measured, the expectation is that in about five years from now, there will be a number of Indian stressed companies where turnaround will take place because of the code.Some flaws in the way that the code is drafted include the fact that lenders too are held at gunpoint in case the resolution plan does not get finalised in the time assigned by the code, according to Rajendra Chitale, managing partner, MP Chitale & Associates.There should be a provision to get extensions if needed, Chitale said, adding that these flaws might have been unintended, but are part of the way bankruptcy play out in the future. Another issue, Chitale points out, is that the law assumes that the resolution plan that is being implemented in the stressed company will work out in the first attempt.  This may lead to an increase in the number of credible assets in the economy which may go into wind-up. Having said that, Chitale believes that the bankruptcy code is a landmark legislation which can change the way business is done in India.",2016-11-02,Ab3yPyjl9xhcHsOJtF2GeK,"At the Mint conference on the Bankruptcy Act, industry professionals, law professionals and stressed asset consultants discuss opportunities and challenges",both,00:51,Measuring the impact of the Bankruptcy Act

				That query posed by Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev at the Isha Foundations annual leadership workshop for entrepreneurs resonated with many attendees, including Deepak Satwalekar, the former managing director and chief executive officer of HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. Ltd.It makes you think and reflect on what your priorities should be. Dont go around trying to fix the world. Fix yourself first, and the rest will follow, said Satwalekar, who has been a resource leader at the annual event since it first started five years ago with the aim of helping small businesses scale up.This year, INSIGHT: The DNA of Success programme, led by Sadhguru, will take place from 24 to 27 November and will feature State Bank of India chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya, Piramal Group and Shriram Group Chairman Ajay Piramal, former Kellogg and INSEAD dean Dipak Jain, former Britannia Industries Ltd MD Vinita Bali, TeamIndus fleet commander Rahul Narayan, Shoppers Stop Ltd non-executive vice-chairman B.S. Nagesh, and textiles minister Smriti Zubin Irani. Mint is a partner of the programme.So what draws so many corporate leaders, academics and entrepreneurs to the event held every year at the Coimbatore headquarters of Sadhgurus Isha Foundation?You will learn several things that you were not taught in management school or at work, and get a chance to be inspired by Sadhguru, said Shanker Annaswamy, the former MD of IBM India Pvt. Ltd.For instance, the workshop helped Sapan Jain summon the courage to leave his corporate job at International Business Machines Corp. and start reverse logistics service provider Blubirch, and alter his entire approach towards problem-solving. It taught him to focus on the variables he could control rather than obsessing over the potential consequences of a situation, ranging from the departure of a key employee to a promised investment falling through.All of us read business books. All of us hear business leaders. Sometimes, (all of that) beyond a point can get vegetative and monotonous. When you hear a different perspective which is still very pragmatic and practical (such as Sadhgurus), it makes a lot of sense, Jain said.Vikash Agrawal, the promoter of power plant equipment maker Hi-Tech Systems & Services Ltd. (HTSSL), agreed.The insights he gleaned there have become a kind of another management book for me, said Agrawal, who is planning to attend the event yet again this year.Agarwal has made sure to implement some of the business lessons he learned at the event, including the fail early concept and the 90-day rule proposed by BRICS Bank chief K.V. Kamath in a bid to set a limit on the time a company should pilot a new idea before moving on.This is exactly why management gurus such as Ram Charan recommend the workshop.The single most reason (that makes this workshop unique) is that the learning is done from the practitioners, Charan said.The resource leaders, who act as informal mentors to entrepreneurs at the event, come from diverse backgrounds and sectors, making it almost a certainty that a participant will find someone he or she will be able to relate with personally and professionally, former attendees said.Also, unlike years past, this years event will include more structured modules on specific topics and include more women and people from the manufacturing, said programme facilitator Nagesh.For Nagesh, the biggest challenge is to make the workshop equally appealing to somebody whose companys sales are Rs10 crore and another who runs a Rs1,000 crore firm. That said, he believes the programme is fairly unique because of the fact that the spiritual part is actually integrated into it. The events faculty chair, Dipak Jain, too has been fascinated by Sadhgurus focus on inner engineering.First you have to be a better person before you start a better business or a better society, Jain said.The programme has proved to be an eye opener for not just the entrepreneurs but also for those who have been past speakers or mentors.Everyone has their own struggle and sometimes understanding how others dealt with their own challenges, can give us the inspiration to move forward, said Dr. Reddys Laboratories Ltd co-chairman and CEO G.V. Prasad.Prasad encouraged entrepreneurs to practise a mantra he learned from Sadhguru that those who want to scale up must learn to let go of their current state without fear and move to a higher plane, akin to trapeze artists, while Satwalekar urged them to stay hungry for knowledge, learn to prioritise, surround themselves with smarter people and not be afraid of failure.For many, like Varda Shine, the former CEO of De Beers Diamond Trading Co, the main draw of the program is Sadhguru, whose way of looking at leadership and success is much wider than any other business learning.And former participants across the board have a simple piece of advice for anyone looking to attend the event this year.As Anupal Banerjee, senior vice president  human resources, Viacom18 Media Pvt.

0.13,"Mumbai: Carnival Cinemas Ltd, the third largest multiplex operator in India, is in early talks with Edelweiss Alternative Asset Advisors Ltd to raise about Rs400-460 crore through a structured debt transaction, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.
				   
				The money will be used to refinance some of Carnivals existing loans and expansion into new markets, one of the two people said on condition of anonymity.Carnival started in 2010 with three screens in Kerala.Serial acquisitions have pushed Carnival to the third position among multiplex operators with about 341 screens, behind only  PVR Ltd (516) and Inox Leisure Ltd (420).Shrikant Bhasi, founder and chairman of the Carnival Cinemas, declined to comment. An email sent to the Edelweiss spokesperson on Tuesday did not elicit any response.In one of the largest buyouts in the multiplex business, Carnival acquired Big Cinemas, a division of Anil Ambanis Reliance MediaWorks Ltd, for around Rs700 crore in December 2014.Carnival, which bought 252 screens of Big Cinemas, had added 30 screens with the acquisition of HDIL Broadway for Rs110 crore in January 2014. In 2015, Carnival made its third acquisition by buying out Stargaze Entertainment Pvt. Ltd from a unit of Mukesh Ambani-controlled Network18 Media and Investments Ltd for an undisclosed amount, giving it 30 additional screens.The company had drawn up aggressive plans to add more screens and also refurbish the existing ones. The company plans to acquire prime real estate across markets to improve occupancy and boost revenues, said the second person cited above.Carnival will invest Rs500 crore for setting up about 200 screens in Madhya Pradesh, Business Standard had reported last year, citing Bhasi.Besides the multiplex buyouts, Carnival Group has made a clutch of acquisitions in real estate. In September 2015, Carnival acquired the commercial real estate projects of Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) in Chandigarh, including Elante Mall, Hyatt Hotel and office premises for Rs1,785 crore.Carnival Group also bought Leela Infopark at Technopark in Thiruvananthapuram for Rs142 crore last year. In a similar deal, Carnival Group had taken over the IT infrastructure of Leela Group in Kochi in July 2014 for Rs280 crore.Structured debt transactions have become common in India, with a number of domestic and foreign institutions and private equity firms disbursing debt finance.Groups such as GMR Holdings Pvt.

-0.62,"The Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd stock has been falling steadily in the past few days. The companys September quarter results have not been anything to write home about. Aided by strong growth in the US, sales increased by a healthy 16.5% but net profit grew just 3.5% and missed analysts estimates as high expenses and finance costs crimped earnings.
				   
				Nevertheless, there are two factors aiding the stock. One is the product pipeline. Business in the US is gaining traction. The company received approvals for 11 products in the first half of the current fiscal year. Last quarter it filed applications for two generic drugs and plans to do more in coming months. In India, another large market for Glenmark, it made two major product launches and is said to be seeing good sales.The new drugs along with the forthcoming launch of a generic version of a patented cholesterol lowering pill will result in strong performance in the coming quarters, Glenn Saldanha, chairman and managing director of Glenmark, told CNBC-TV18.The second factor is the financial deleveraging plan. A cholesterol lowering drug, gZetia, scheduled for launch in December, will have sales exclusivity for the company. It is a blockbuster drug (with annual sales of more than $1 billion) and is likely to have disproportionate impact on Glenmarks earnings in the next three quarters at least. The gZetia launch scheduled in H2 FY2017 will give a big fillip to sales and profitability, Sharekhan Ltd said in a note.Glenmark plans to use earnings from this drug to lower debt, a legacy problem that has weighed on its return ratios and stock valuations. The management aims to bring down the net debt-to-Ebitda ratio from 2.2 times last fiscal year to 1.25 times. Even otherwise, the management expects the profitability in the core business to improve due to new products. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.Analysts estimate the cholesterol lowering drug and recently-raised funds to help cut debt by $150-200 million (Rs1,000-1,334 crore) by the end of the current fiscal year or early next year.If things progress as planned, then a niggling worry about the companys balance sheet will be addressed, which will bring down finance costs and help expand valuation of the stock, which is trading at a discount to sector average valuations. According to HDFC Securities Ltd, the Glenmark stock, up 10% in the last six months, reflects some of the positives.A better-than-expected earnings boost from the forthcoming cholesterol drug launch can lead to surprise returns, adds HDFC Securities.

				Thus far, investors enthusiasm about the change in ownership hasnt translated into a meaningful improvement in performance.On the contrary, Mphasis has continued to struggle for growth.Last quarter, revenues declined 5.3% year-on-year (y-o-y) in dollar terms to $224.1 million, faring worse than the June quarter, when revenues had declined by 4.1%.According to the company, its direct international business was impacted by one client, which reduced business because of cost optimization measures.The direct international business refers to work Mphasis receives from sources other than Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE), its erstwhile parent company.

				Revenue at the consolidated level increased 46.6% from a year ago, slower than the 50%-plus growth the Street was forecasting. The miss is largely due to the commercial vehicles (CVs) divisionVE Commercial Vehicles Ltd (VECV). The business continues to see high discounts, Siddhartha Lal, Eicher Motors managing director and chief executive officer said. Add to this an unfavourable product mix and realizations fell from both the year ago and on a sequential basis, Religare Capital Markets Ltds calculations show.The silver lining is the division had one of the best quarters in recent years. Volumes are up 41% and the business gained market share in buses and medium, light and heavy duty trucks. The strong volumes led to the belief that realizations and economies of scale will see significant improvement. But contrarily, Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin at the CV division is estimated to have risen by less than a percentage point to 8%, pointing to competitive pressures. Three brokerage firms had forecast the divisions margins to expand in the range of 1.4-2.9 percentage points.The motorcycle business on the other hand lived up to expectations. Revenues at the stand-alone level jumped 60.7% on an almost similar rise in volumes. Margins expanded 3.8 percentage points to 29.9%. This helped expand consolidated margin to 17%, driving up Ebitda and net profit by 75% and 71%, respectively.Investors will do well to prepare for growth moderation in the motorcycle business. From around five months in early 2015, the waiting period for the companys popular selling model has reduced to three months now. But then, the reduction is partly explained by increased production. A production plan of 675,000 units in 2016-17 translates to a growth of 33% (based on previous year sales). Sales in 2015-16 were up 53%. The company is giving a strong push to two new modelsContinental GT and Himalayan. But the models are yet to take off in a big way. That raises question about valuations, which at 30 times the current fiscal year earnings estimate is the most expensive automobile stock to own.To be sure, Eicher continues to expand its addressable market. It plans to ramp up its Himalayan model in coming months and improve its international reach.

				Consolidated net profit is likely to increase to Rs7,282.5 crore on a revenue of Rs63,669.9 crore for the three months ended on 30 September, according to a Bloomberg poll of six analysts. In the year-earlier quarter, the company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs6,720 crore and revenue of Rs75,117 crore. RIL will announce its second-quarter earnings on Thursday. After six consecutive sequential earnings increases, we expect RILs standalone earnings to moderate 2% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), mainly due to weaker refining. But, RIL may surprise again. We expect another record petchem EBIT, said Nomura Research in a 7 October note to clients. Ebit stands for earnings before interest and taxes and is an indication of a companys profitability. RILs refining and marketing business, which accounts for over 75% of revenue and more than 60% of profit, could be hurt due to lower refining margins.Analysts expect RILs gross refining margin (GRM) to be $9.5-10 per barrel. GRM is the realization from turning every barrel of crude oil into finished products. We estimate GRM to be down 10% QoQ (quarter on quarter) while throughput 7% higher QoQ following a restart of special economic zone crude distillation unit after 20 days maintenance shutdown in May 2016. Refining EBITDA will therefore fall 6% QoQ, said Edelweiss Research in a 5 October report. During the September quarter, Singapore GRM averaged at $5.1 per barrel compared with $5 in the preceding three months.We expect RIL to report a $10 GRM versus $11.5 in 1Q, the latter including $2 of hedging & inventory gains, said Citi Research in its report dated 4 October. Earnings from the petrochemicals segment, however, are expected to rise on higher volume and wider margins. We expect petchem earnings to show strong growth led by higher volumes (some expansion projects are gradually reflecting in earnings) and improved spreads in the polymer chain, said IDFC Securities in a report dated 5 October. On the exploration and production (E&P) front, which includes domestic assets and US shale gas assets, the second quarter could also be a loss-making one for RIL as crude oil and domestic gas prices are lower compared to last year. Production from the KG block is also expected to be lower. RIL is likely to report losses in a small EBIT profit on domestic E&P. US shale will continue to remain loss-making.

Moreover, the governments stand on the 5/20 rule is far from clear and one will have to wait for the final policy.The recent surge in airline stocks could also be because of a large purchase by Rakesh Jhunjhunwalas Rare Enterprises. The firm purchased 1.2 million shares of Jet Airways on Friday. For perspective, the daily average delivered quantity on the Jet Airways counter stood at 0.5 million on NSE and BSE in the past year. It is premature to conclude that NCAP is a game changer of sorts for the sector at this point of time. The recent fall in crude oil prices could be a reason for the renewed enthusiasm, but its worth remembering that Jet Airways and SpiceJet have a lot of debt on their balance sheets.Nonetheless, the sudden interest generated in the sector leaves little doubt that market leader IndiGos shares will list with a pop. The million-dollar question then is: is the price burst temporary, and should investors exit on listing? The answer to that will depend on the view investors have on crude oil prices, but the consensus currently is that theyre likely to remain low. Moreover, another silver lining for investors is that domestic passenger traffic data is more than reasonable, with 20% year-on-year growth during January-September.",2015-11-02,BJNeueoxLYPhsQ6q0FbZGM,"With one of the two most anticipated initial share sales out of the way, what can investors expect from listing of InterGlobe Aviation Ltd

-1.0,"Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan is an assistant professor in the department of computer science and engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay. He specialises in artificial intelligence (AI) and is the only author from India who is part of an 18-member study panel of the Stanford University-hosted report titled Artificial Intelligence and Life. Kalyanakrishnans expertise broadly fits in the area of machine learning. Called reinforcement learning, it defines what actions software agents should take to maximize a certain type of reward after learning from reward and punishment. In an interview, he urges people to be more optimistic about the things AI can do rather than be obsessed with the fear around AI machines. Edited excerpts:
How was the Stanford AI report conceived? How did you get involved?In the last 5-10 years, the public has been forced to take notice of AI. You do searches, for instance, and get the information you want. You can talk to your phone using Apples Siri. There is so much intelligence in your car. Everywhere, intelligent software is assisting you in your lifestyle in a very noticeable way. The common mans perception is that AI is taking away jobs. Jobs that people used to do about 10 years back have been replaced either partially or even fully in some cases by software and hardware developments. This triggered the conversation, which led to experts being asked about their opinion of where AI is heading and what can be done about it.In the last few months, there have been some alarmist views, even by physicist Stephen Hawking. Moreover, even a person like Elon Musk, who is responsible for taking technology forward with his ventures like Tesla and SpaceX, has expressed similar sentimentsthat things could go awfully wrong once we have AI doing actions that human beings traditionally have done.Eric (Horvitz, a computer scientist and technical fellow at Microsoft) has been with Microsoft Research and is primarily responsible for this report. He decided that we needed a more sober assessment of AInot based on emotions but one that is more rigorous and scientific. We will have a study panel every five years. This is the first one. I was chosen by Peter (Peter Stone, professor at the department of computer science, University of Texas) because the study panel was looking at diversity in age, gender and geography. This came together in May 2015, and we were given a year to do this. As a group, we agreed that it is true that AI is game-changing, that it is moving at a fast pace. Hence, we did not forecast beyond 2030, because it is not scientific to do so when there is so much uncertainty about the concept.Can you list some of these uncertainties?Look back to 1995. I dont think it was possible way back then to predict accurately some of the things that we have today. The Internet has happened, so have smartphones and social networks. Its the nature of science and technology which makes it difficult to predict beyond a certain period. There are just too many variables.What was your contributions to the AI report?My contribution was more to define AI. We take intelligence for granted in human beings. We expect people to be able to do certain tasks, to answer questions meaningfully etc. So what are the operating principles that define intelligence? How is it constructed? What are its mathematical foundations? We have asked these questions earlier too, and even in the 70s we had automata (a machine which performs a range of functions according to a predetermined set of coded instructions).For instance, you still have churches where clocks do specific tasks (for example, birds chiming) when their gongs strike midnight. The confluence of software and mathematics really took place in the 1950s when computers became available. We had the Eniac (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) which was built during the war (World War II), and it became possible to build computer systems that could exhibit intelligence. So technically speaking, the first such computer systems were aimed at helping soldiers during the Warused to calculate things like the trajectory of a missile; planning logistics, etc. This explains why DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) has been funding computer science in general and AI for a long time. But the pioneers of AI have also been thinking about AI in scientific terms. Scientists like Alan Turing, who can be considered to be the fountainhead of AI despite the fact that he did not have access to real hardware, was one (such, who was),  thinking about writing a programme to play chess.So what exactly is AI?The term was coined only in 1956 in a workshop (Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence) put together by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon and Nathaniel Rochester. So you can think of AI as a branch of computer science but it is multidisciplinary: it has constant inputs from psychologists, linguists, roboticists, etc. You know intelligence when you see it. But how do you get an artificial agent to show intelligence? Most people would consider a machine to be endowed with AI if it performs like a human being. You can think of examples like Google search or Google Maps. Computers can play chess, which was the holy grail of AI, and now even beat grandmasters. We think of intelligence as a spectrum that is constantly being propelled forward. And AI is what can do this. In some sense, AI is this desire to replicate intelligence in hardware. It is also, in a strange sense, the sum total of what an AI researcher is doingsomething in robotics, NLP (natural language processing), etc. AI does not have a rigid definition. Hence we went with (Nils J.) Nilssons definition in the AI report (AI is that activity devoted to making machines intelligent, and intelligence is that quality that enables an entity to function appropriately and with foresight in its environment).What does the AI concept comprise?The broad architecture of an intelligent agent is one that senses the environment, which does some amount of thinking, and then takes actions in the real world. If you consider sensing, there is the whole area of Computer Vision, which tries to make sense of objects we see. We, then, have the field of speech processing that has to do with audio. When you go to actuation, you have fields like robotics, haptics, etc. AI also comprises machine learning, knowledge representation and logic. Humans typically make changes to their behaviour as they learn from experiences. So if the experience that a programme undergoes somehow changes its behaviour, you can say that the programme is applying machine learning. Now we have data-driven machine learning. Consider the case of hospitals gathering patient datavital parameters like blood sugar level, age, gender, blood pressure, etc. Now lets presume the hospital has collected this data for, say, 1,000 patients and diagnosed diabetic patients from this lot. A machine learning algorithm can then sift through this data and learn a predictor and predict whether a new patient (whose body parameters are available) is diabetic or not. Similar is the case with Google search that has moved from also displaying irrelevant links to using machine learning algorithms that have refined this task over the last few years.The technical base for designing machine learning systems comes primarily from streams like probability and statistics. Then we have NLP, which is the most natural. By speaking natural languages that is quite different from the language that computers use to communicate (1s and 0sbits and bytes), NLP has got to a state when you can take a shot at machine translation. The basic building blocks for NLP comprise actual models of languages. The linguistic hierarchy of language begins with syntax, moving on to semantics (study of relationships between words and how we construct meaning) and later, pragmatics (e.g. you can use sarcasm, punstypically where you need an understanding of culture and context). Anyone dealing with NLP has to know these branches.What about Deep Learning?Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) aim to simulate the human brain. They can be used to map inputs to predictions. There are standard learning algorithms to train ANNs based on data. Neural networks have been around for almost three decades but it was very difficult to train large and deep (with more layers) neural networks. Technically, they get stuck in the so-called Local Minimum (defined as the best solution to a problem within a small neighbourhood of possible solutions as opposed to the concept of global optimum, which is the optimal solution when every possible solution is considered). Ironically, you do need ANNs with many layers. Deep Learning helps us to successfully train larger ANNs.Will true AI ever be achieved?This has divided researchers over the decades. Most people in the AI community subscribe to the view that it does not really matter if machines are exactly replicating what human beings can do, as long as we do things that are intelligent and of value. For example, we have software that can fly an aircraftvery differently from how a human being would do it but it is doing it nevertheless.What are the challenges? Explaining AI to the public itself is a challenge. That said, can inputs be automatically learnt or combined in ways that can give higher level abstractions, to make the task of prediction easier? In the context of vision, the inputs to computer vision systems is just images (matrix of 0s and 1s). But deep learning algorithms are able to abstract things out like edges, boundaries, locations of objects, etc. You can have a deep learning system to autonomously drive a car. The software agent needs to reason about stop signs, etc., (and) not only about camera images; it has to learn a host of features from scratch. The other challenge is that hardware needs to match the pace of development in software. The brain also uses less energy than the chips that we are building today, which are simulating our neurons using a different architecture that generates a lot of heat. Hence, there is a move to develop specialized hardware using a neural architecture as opposed to the traditional Von Neumann architecture. If this becomes a reality a decade from now, we will be able to do a lot more with neural networks than we can now. Not only does a neural network need to be good at its task, it should also be energy efficient.There is a lot of scare-mongering around AI. What is your perspective on this issue?People are driven a lot by what they see in movies. Part of the common persons concern is around the Frankenstein that will do nasty things. The fact is that AI is beginning to work in very specialized tasks like controlling an airplane or driving your car. Its hard to think of any general AI machine that can do all of these tasks in unisonclearly something that humans excel at. As far as AI machines are concerned, this is certainly not on the horizon for at least the next 15-20 years. This scare is unfounded. But the fear that certain types of jobs will vanish because AI (software bots and machines) will do it more efficiently is genuine. Policy makers should prepare themselves for this, and proactively retrain and reskill the people who will be affected to help them cope better with the situation.",2017-01-23,BTmqgM825lBVJvZGYCMz9H,IIT Bombay professor Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan urges people to be more optimistic about the things artificial intelligence can do,competitor,05:29,AI is the desire to replicate intelligence in machines: Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan
-0.01,"Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) had reported a premium of $3.1 per barrel over the Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) for the March quarter. For the June quarter, that premium was expected to expand further. However, the reported premium of $6.5 per barrel, the highest in the last eight years according to RIL, far exceeded Street estimates. Most analysts had estimated the companys GRM to be in the range of $9.5-10 per barrel. On the contrary, RILs GRM in the June quarter came in at $11.5 per barrel.
				   
				There are a couple of reasons for this outperformance. One, as Alok Agarwal, chief financial officer at RIL, said, We did have a build-up in inventory towards the end of last quarter and we were able to liquidate that inventory at better prices than at the end of the last quarter. Secondly, middle distillates, which include gas oil (diesel) and aviation fuel and account for nearly 45% of the companys product slate, performed better. Our crude sourcing was competitive too, pointed out Agarwal.Even as the GRM beat is strong, not everybody is impressed. Theres no point in taking a call on GRM alone, said independent analyst S.P. Tulsian. He added that looking at inventory at the end of the last fiscal year, it is likely that inventory gains, perhaps to the extent of approximately $2.5 per barrel, are included in the reported GRM.Nonetheless, the fact remains that a strong performance by the refining segment did help the company beat analysts estimates by a good margin. But its worth remembering that the RIL stock has already gone up in the past five trading sessions.Moreover, the performance of other business segments is not very encouraging. Sure, petrochemicals business Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin improved to 14.9% from 14% in the March quarter. But that was largely in line with Street estimates. While the oil and gas business reported an Ebit of Rs.48 crore compared with a loss in the March quarter, it hardly moves the needle for RIL. Losses of US shale operations increased.Stand-alone revenue declined about 19%, reflecting the decline in broader crude oil prices, while net profit increased about 19% to Rs.7,548 crore. That was because of a 628 basis point jump in operating profit margin to 20%, while depreciation cost declined 3% and other income increased 18.5%, helping net profit growth. A basis point is 0.01%.What of the stock? RIL shares have underperformed the benchmark Sensex since it announced its March quarter numbers. Some reasons for the underperformance can be attributed to the fact that the company had guided analysts about delays in commissioning of its downstream projects, lower refining margin environment and lack of clarity on the timelines of its telecom launch.Currently, one RIL share trades at about 11 times its estimated earnings per share for this fiscal year. Of course, news flow on the telecom launch will be an important measure to track and so will developments on commissioning of downstream expansion projects. In the near term, what is worrisome is that Singapore refining margins have hardly improved. Even as RIL delivered a great beat in the June quarter, the pertinent questions are whether that will sustain. As of now, analysts dont see inventory gains recurring for the current quarter.The crude spreads that are relevant to RILs refineries have contracted in June and July 2016 from levels in April and May 2016, according to ICICI Securities Ltd. This contraction of light-heavy crude spread would hit RILs GRM if it sustains, wrote analysts from ICICI Securities in a note on 7 July. Unfortunately for investors, it could well mean that the robust GRM performance seen last quarter may not be repeated in the current one.The writer does not have positions in the companies discussed here.",2016-07-16,BYyVceR6MiTJTGQ0FWjPEK,"Most analysts had estimated its gross refining margins to be $9.5-10 per barrel; on the contrary, RILs margins in the June quarter came in at $11.5 per barrel

-0.67,"Vodafone Group Plc said it was hit by an impairment charge of 6.38 billion ($6.86 billion) with respect to its investment in India. After accounting for a deferred tax asset, the net impairment charge was lower at 5 billion. A little over six years ago, it had written down goodwill and other intangible assets by £2.3 billion ($3.33 billion).
				   
				On both occasions, the company cited an increase in competitive pressure, leading to a reassessment of profit growth projections, which led to large write-downs in the carrying value of Vodafones India assets. Its worthwhile noting here that Vodafone had paid a hefty premium while acquiring the India operations in 2007, and it isnt surprising that the bloated value of intangible assets have to be periodically written down.Even so, Vodafones impairment charge this time around looks fairly high, at more than double the previous one. Note that so far this year, market capitalizations of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd have fallen by around $2 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, reflecting the large value erosion in the sector. As such, the large write-down only underscores the troubles the sector is facing. Six years ago, when the previous impairment charge was taken by Vodafone, it had assumed Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) growth of 17.5% on an average in the five years till March 2015. Interestingly, organic profit growth ranged 15-20% during this period, although it fell sharply to 4.1% in fiscal year 2015-16. With the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, sluggish growth rates are expected to continue. The growth assumptions for the current impairment testing assume Ebitda growth of 7.8% on an average in the next five years. A new entrant has recently launched free trial services for an extended time period and commercial price plans that were at a significant discount to prevailing market pricing, resulting in competitive responses from other operators. This has created a high degree of uncertainty over a range of commercial planning assumptions including future pricing, profitability and market structure, the company said in a statement. This is perhaps the first official acknowledgment that Reliance Jios launch has been hugely value destructive. Strangely enough, despite the diminishing returns from the sector, large companies are increasing capital expenditure to retain market share. As a result, return ratios are falling from already low levels. The only silver lining, from an investors perspective, is that share prices of Indian telcos have already fallen sharply in recent months, and seem to be pricing in a fairly bad future.",2016-11-16,Bd3qtEbVPw0PwNRCxQwYxH,"At 6.38 billion, Vodafones impairment charge this time around looks fairly high, at more than double the previous one",competitor,07:51,"Vodafone sees sluggish growth, thanks to Reliance Jio"
-0.69,"Last November, when Idea Cellular Ltd agreed to pay top dollar for Videocon Telecommunications Ltds spectrum, it looked like the much-awaited consolidation in the industry was becoming a costly exercise. But Idea Cellular has walked out of the deal, and while Videocon has found another buyer in Bharti Airtel Ltd, valuations have come crashing down. 
				   
				Its premature to conclude that rationality has returned to the industry. Even so, the Videocon deal has some heartening takeawaysof course, for everyone except Videocon. The delay in Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds launch means companies can breathe a bit easier. And the likelihood that the government will harmonize spectrum in 1800 megahertz (MHz) band before this years auction means that this resource may not be as scarce as was earlier feared. Idea Cellular had agreed to pay Rs.3,310 crore for contiguous 1800MHz spectrum in Gujarat and UP (West) circles. This effectively worked out to a 133% premium vis-à-vis the latest reserve price recommended by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. By the same measure, Videocon may have expected another Rs.3,000 crore for the remaining four circles in which it has similar spectrum. That means the amount for all six circles would be about Rs.6,610 crore. Instead, it has agreed to sell spectrum in all six circles to Bharti Airtel for a much lower amount of Rs.4,428 crore. While Videocon has settled for lower valuations vis-à-vis last November, the sale price represents a 100% premium to its purchase price. Another way to look at the deal is that Bharti Airtel is acquiring the spectrum at 34% of the last discovered price for 900MHz spectrum in these circles, whereas Idea Cellular had agreed to pay as much as 55% for the two circles it had agreed to buy. According to analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, the price of 1800 relative to the price of 900 was 35% in A-category circles and 47% in metro circles in the March 2015 auctions. Bharti Airtel, therefore, appears to have struck a reasonable deal, especially keeping in mind that the entire spectrum is contiguous and hence suitable for deploying 4G services. The six circles contribute to 23% of Bharti Airtels revenue. Also, it will now have 4G spectrum in 19 circles, versus 15 earlier. Bhartis 4G-1800 spectrum footprint is now slightly better than that of Reliance Jio, JM Financials analysts wrote in a 17 March note. Interestingly, while Bharti Airtel shares rose 1.3% on the National Stock Exchange on Thursday, those of Idea Cellular gained 3.15%. Of course, investors will be relieved that Idea Cellular backed out of the expensive deal. And as far as the gaps in its 4G footprint go, the auction later this year is likely to provide opportunities to fill them. Besides, as pointed out earlier, with the delay in Reliance Jios launch, companies have been able to breathe a bit easy. Having said all this, the industry is far from being out of the woods. At best, Idea Cellular may have ended up saving about Rs.1,000 crore, which isnt much, considering that it had paid as much as Rs.30,000 crore in the March 2015 auction. Recent data suggests that growth in data revenue is falling and is calling to question the high amounts firms have spent on spectrum purchases and network roll-outs. Its little wonder that since April last year, Idea Cellular shares have nearly halved.",2016-03-17,BgcOlRFxdzfZCojoG4ZjbK,"Idea Cellular has walked out of the deal, and while Videocon has found another buyer in Bharti Airtel, valuations have come crashing down

-0.4,"New York/Seattle: Its time for Jorge Paulo Lemann to get back in the hunt.
				   
				That, anyway, is the word inside the food industry, where the Brazilian billionaire has been doing blockbuster deals roughly every two years. In 2013, he persuaded Warren Buffett to team up on H.J. Heinz. Then, in 2015, the duo orchestrated the $55 billion merger of Heinz and Kraft Foods.Its logical that this would be the year, said David Palmer, a food industry analyst at RBC Capital.The talk has traders on edge. Last month, a story in a little-known Swiss magazine, resurfacing well-worn speculation about Lemanns plan to buy Mondelez with Buffett, spurred an immediate pop in the US snack giants shares. (They soared 28% in just a few minutes.) So far, no deal has been announced. Regardless, the question of what Lemann might go after in 2017 has just about everyone grasping for leads. Besides Mondelez, some other names include General Mills, Kellogg and Campbell Soup.There is even talk that Buffetts beloved Coca-Cola, a prospect that some dismissed as fantasy, could be in play.All the attention goes to show just how much the 77-year-old Lemann has reshaped and influenced the global food and beverage industry. In the past decade, Lemann and his Brazilian partners at 3G Capital have made their names with a run of splashy deals, including Anheuser-Busch and Burger King, and a singular vision of hacking away costs at every turn.Modus OperandiHis team has been so effective at boosting profits that companies have had to change how they do businessor risk becoming targets themselves. Some industry insiders have criticized 3Gs methods as draconian and short-sighted, and suggest the constant need for acquisitions reflects the fact that cost cuts alone cant boost sales.At Mondelez, chief executive officer Irene Rosenfeld says a more balanced approach to improving margins will ultimately lead to bigger returns for shareholders.ALSO READ | Warren Buffett says he supports Donald Trumps cabinet overwhelminglyWeve been walking and chewing gum at the same time, Rosenfeld said. She declined to discuss whether the maker of Cadbury and Oreos, a long-rumored target for 3G, has been approached about combining with Kraft Heinz.Nevertheless, Lemann has made a believer out of Buffett, widely recognized as one of savviest and most successful investors in the world.With Buffett, whos sitting on an $85 billion cash hoard, the strategy is simple. Buffett ponies up the money to help finance the acquisitions and Lemanns team does the dirty work. Invariably, that means firing workers, closing factories and paring unnecessary expenses.When all the savings are wrung out, 3G looks for the next target. And theres no shortage of options in the packaged-food industry, which is struggling as consumers shun traditional grocery staples for healthier options.At Heinz, the first deal that Buffett did with Lemann, 3G immediately installed its own managers. They shuttered five factories, did away with employee perks and eliminated more than 7,000 jobs. After just 18 months, Heinzs profit margins (based on a measure known as Ebitda) rose to an industry-leading 26% from 18% prior to the takeover.Loaded UpThat paved the way for the Kraft Foods takeover, which was announced in March 2015. At the time, 3G promised to cut $1.5 billion in annual costs by the end of 2017. So far, its ahead of schedule. According to research from Bernstein, Kraft Heinz is already 88% of the way there. Margins are also up. Before the acquisition, Krafts Ebitda consistently hovered around 20% of revenue. Now, the combined companys margin is at 30%.Investors have taken notice. Shares of Kraft Heinz have risen 23% since the company began trading in July 2015more than double the gain of consumer staples stocks in the S&P 500 Index.Kraft Heinzs success is fueling speculation 3G will soon need to look for yet another target to tack on to keep things going. Last November, news that the investment firm was raising at least $5 billion to finance a new acquisition pushed shares of General Mills, Kellogg, Campbell and Mondelez higher.Theyve pretty much implemented the playbook, so theyre loaded up and ready to go, said Asit Sharma, an analyst at The Motley Fool.Takeover TalkMany food-industry executives are already feeling the heat. Last year, Mondelezs pursuit of Hershey was partly seen as a defensive move to bulk up and stave off a takeover. Hershey resisted and a deal never happened.RBCs Palmer says Mondelez, which generates more than 70% of its revenue outside of North America, is the most likely target for Kraft Heinz. Kraft and Mondelez split in 2012, but now the company would give 3G an international presence and plenty of room to improve margins.A possible takeover of Mondelez, which has a market value of almost $70 billion, has even attracted the likes of hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman, who took a large stake in the company in 2015.Other analysts have focused on General Mills, Kellogg and Campbell, which would give Kraft Heinz a stronger US presence in categories like snack chips, soup and cereal, and make it easier for 3G to cut costs. Bernsteins Alexia Howard says Kraft Heinz will buy General Mills later this year.(3G declined to comment, as did Kraft Heinz, General Mills, Kellogg and Campbell. Buffett didnt respond to requests for comment.)Wild CardOne potential wild card is Donald Trump. The new US president has vowed to protect American jobs and has aggressively gone after companies that have moved them overseas. Big job cutsa hallmark of every 3G takeovercould draw Trumps ire, says Ken Shea, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.They may have a tougher time politically laying off thousands of people, Shea said.That hasnt kept some investors from talking about what would be the most audacious deal of them all: a Buffett-backed takeover of Coke.Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway is Cokes biggest shareholder (with a 9% stake) and Lemann once called the company his dream acquisition.To swallow the $179 billion soft-drink maker, an offer would probably need to come from Anheuser-Busch InBev, which Lemann controls along with other Brazilian billionaires and wealthy Belgian families. AB InBev and Coke both declined to comment.As recently as 2015, Buffett said a deal was very unlikely because Coke wasnt looking for one. But last month, his son Howard announced he wouldnt stand for re-election to the companys board. CEO Muhtar Kent also said he will step down next year and hand the reins to his lieutenant, James Quincey. Thats fueled speculation a deal is more likely now.This seems like a situation tailor-made for a 3G transformation, said Steve Wallman, a fund manager and longtime Berkshire shareholder.

				Lupin said the observations at its Madhya Pradesh facility were minor and that it expected to get a voluntary action indicated audit observation. Even after this clarification, the share ended with a 6.3% decline, although thats a lot better than the 13.5% decline at the days low point.Mention a pharma companys name, USFDA and observations in the same breath and investors dont wait to ask questions. If Lupins word had been taken at face value, then its share should have ended flat.Take the case of Natco Pharma Ltd.On Monday, Natco Pharmas shares fell 12.6% after an inspection at two of its facilities led to observations from the USFDA. It clarified these were minor and it expected no adverse impact. On Tuesday, its share fell by 4.1%.A continuing series of USFDA inspections that are uncovering irregularities in compliance has unnerved investors. Comforting noises from companies are not sufficient to calm these nerves, chiefly due to their past experience.In some companies, USFDA actions have led to a ban on exports to the US, implementing costly remediation plans that affect normal operations and the stopping of new drug approvals from the affected facilities. Even in these cases, companies had said that they were addressing problems and everything will be alright, eventually.The compliance-related issues have combined with other adverse factors, such as slow rate of generic approvals and declining realizations, contributing to slower US market growth for some companies.

Domestic and emerging markets have not been able to compensate.The BSE Healthcare Index has fallen 13% in three months, nearly thrice the 4.5% decline seen in the broader markets. Maybe, some of this is also due to a shift away from the defensives. But a large share can be attributed to the continuing trip-ups on the compliance front.

-0.43,"Does your flagship Boroline cream have a market outside West Bengal?
				   
				Boroline has always had a strong market outside West Bengal. But previously, say around 20 years ago, 60% of our revenue came from West Bengal. But now at least 65% of our revenue comes from outside West Bengal.Which are the states where your products are doing well?In the past 4-5 years, some states such as Maharashtra and Gujarat have done phenomenally well for us. In Mumbai alone, for instance, we have some 45 distributors now, up from just 10 six years ago. The market for our products is spread across the country now, though there are still some states such as Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telengana which are not doing as well as they should.In nearby Kerala, we are doing very well. Also in Tamil Nadu, we used to have a very strong market previouslysay in the 1970s.What kind of distribution strength do you have now?We have around 28 SKUs (stock keeping units) now. We dont sell all of them nationally, but for our key productsthe Boroline cream and the Suthol liquidwe have close to 2,400 distributors across the country.What is the creams contribution to your revenue?For years, we have been a one-product company. So clearly, the Boroline ointments contribution to our Rs150 crore revenue is still quite high at about 60%. But Suthol, which was launched in 2003, is fast gaining traction, and now accounts for about 30% of our revenue. Suthol sales are growing 20% year-on-year, while Boroline sales are growing 8%.The balance 10% of our revenue comes from our other productsEleen hair oil, Penorub pain reliving lotion and Glosoft face washmost of which are sold only in West Bengal.Within these categories, the Boroline cream sold in the tube is still the biggest. But our fastest growing SKU is the creams Rs10 tub.What led to the launch of Suthol?Around 2001, the companys then chairperson, my mother, the late Bela Dutta, was bed-ridden. Soumitra Pal, one of our directors, suggested that we develop our own antiseptic liquid for her. What he came up with turned out to be very effective. So we decided to launch it commercially.But when doing so, we decided to market it differently because the space for multipurpose antiseptic liquid was already taken by strong brands such as Dettol and Savlon.We called Suthol an antiseptic skin liquid and positioned it as a solution for heat rashes. There were prickly heat powders in the market, but no liquid. So it took off immediately. Though Suthol has a wide variety of usesyou can, for instance, splash it to ward off mosquitoesits sales are seasonal and are still dependent on how bad the summer is.We are expanding the Suthol range: apart from three different fragrances, we have launched an alcohol-free variant. The response is very encouraging. So, we shall have more Suthol variants going alcohol-free.At least two other product linesEleen hair oil and Penorubhave high brand recall, at least in West Bengal. Why are these not sold nationally?It is by choice that we are not selling them nationally. Eleen was launched in the late 1990s and was our first diversification in many years. The product was designed keeping in mind the preferences of consumers in West Bengal in terms of texture and fragrance.Penorub is not new to our portfoliowe used to have an ointment by that name previously. It was in demand but we had to phase it out in 1987-88 because of problems with procuring ingredients. In 2006-07, we re-launched it as a gel and towards the end of 2014, as a roll-on. We are working on other forms of packaging so that the lotion could be applied more effectively to relieve pain. To my mind, it will start to get traction in about one-and-a-half years, when we will look to launch it nationally.What to your mind are your key strengths?Our products and our people. We use natural ingredients in all our productsnothing synthetic at all. Add to it our ability to develop new products in-house. We have a team of 14 led by my wife Mahashweta Dutta dedicated to product development. And we have made sure that our successful products are consistentthey dont change.Detractors say Boroline is a sticky ointment. We agree Boroline is ultra rich and will always be so. And because of its thick texture, it is so effective in treating dry skin. We advise people to use it at night.Consistency in quality is so important to us that in the early 1990sin 1998 or 1999we had to suspend production of Boroline because our fragrance supplier was not being able to supply ingredients of the same quality as it previously did. We suffered an outage of at least three months before we could find a new supplier who could produce the same fragrance. Most of our suppliers today are family owned enterprises. The common trait between us and our suppliers is our commitment to product consistency.Our people are just as important to us as our customers. We have around 250 employees now, and on average, they have put in 10-15 years each in our company. If you consider the people in senior management, that number is going to go up manifold. Our directors, for instance, have worked in this company for over 30 years.What is your experience of dealing with labour unrest in West Bengal?Yes, we have had issues with workers in our unit here, which was commissioned in 1988. And even previously, when we used to operate out of a rented facility in north Kolkata.But our policy has been very simple: never reach out to people outside the company to resolve labour disputes. Because we believe that our workers have the same goal as the managementfor mutual benefit, the company must prosper. Sometimes, it took time, but we have settled all our disputes internally.To be fair, labour issues started to come down at the turn of the century but overall industrial environment improved significantly only since Mamata Banerjee came to power in 2011.You have led the company for 15 years. Where do you see this company headed in the days ahead?We enjoy a great deal of goodwill in consumers mind. But market dynamics are changing, and the art of marketing goodwill is changing with every passing day. Our thrust going forward will be on expanding retail penetration. Whereas previously, we would deal with say one or two distributors in a whole district, we now need to reach out to several distributors even in villages.ALSO READ | Its business as usual for 87-year-old BorolineAlongside, we would also want the export market to open up and launch new products.

-0.6,"The Essar Group may have been in a debt trap, but there are no signs of distress in the Essar Oil Ltd sale to PJSC Rosneft Oil Co and a consortium led by commodities trader Trafigura and private investment group United Capital Partners. Essar said it has sold a 98% stake in the oil company at an enterprise valuation (EV) of $10.9 billion or Rs72,800 crore.
				   
				This works out to around 12.5 times Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization). Most analysts value Reliance Industries Ltds refining business at an EV/Ebitda multiple of around seven times at best. Prima facie, Essar has got itself a good deal.Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients, The formal announcement of the deal at the recent BRICS summit in the presence of the political leaders of India and Russia suggests a high degree of involvement of the Indian government in the transaction. We note that Indian PSU oil companies had earlier purchased a 49.9% stake in the Vankor oil block of Rosneft.Besides, according to a Bloomberg report, Essar was in talks with as many as five overseas oil companies for the asset sale. Its natural that Rosneft and the consortium ended up paying a premium when the competition was as high.That aside, the Essar asset offers decent growth opportunities. The company has had plans to double capacity at the existing plant, but couldnt do so because of financial constraints. The buyers should be able to follow through on these expansion plans and drive growth. Besides, Essar Oils refinery is in close proximity to the deep draft Vadinar port, which lends greater efficiency to the operations. The port has been acquired in a separate transaction at a valuation of $2 billion. Essar Oil also operates a network of 2,700 retail outlets. They may not have added much to overall profits until now, but their prospects have improved because of increased deregulation of prices of petroleum products.Rosneft can drive synergies by shipping relatively cheap crude oil from Venezuela and the Trafigura connect will help in selling oil products to Asia-Pacific markets.Essar Oil currently processes around 145 million barrels of crude oil annually. According to an oil industry analyst who did not want to be identified, its safe to assume that the company makes an Ebitda of around $6 per barrel, resulting in an annual Ebitda of $870 million. While this results in an expensive valuation of 12.5 times for the refining asset, this must be seen in light of other growth prospects, the added advantage of the port facility and the retail outlets, he adds. What about implications of the deal for Indian companies?The Essar Groups total debt in the system is estimated to be about Rs1.3 trillion, and this is expected to reduce substantially after the deal. While the group will use the proceeds to pay off debt, bank debt will also reduce, as part of Essar Oils debt is being refinanced by a Russian lender, according to news reports.ALSO SEE | Rosneft-Essar Oil deal cuts Essar Groups debt, lifts banksICICI Bank Ltd, one of the largest lenders to the Essar Group, has already seen a nearly $1.5 billion rise in market capitalization after the deal announcement.

-1.0,"Mumbai: Manishi Raychaudhuri, head of Asia (ex-Japan), equity strategy at BNP Paribas Securities, expects the US Federal Reserve to increase interest rates in December. In an interview, he says he continues to expect emerging market equities to outperform developed market equities. Raychaudhuri has an overweight stance on China, India, South Korea and  Thailand in Asia. Edited excerpts:
Now that the US Federal Reserve and Bank of Japans (BoJ) decisions have arrived, what do you make of these developments?

The common thread running through both the policymakers decisions is that they both decided to keep interest rates unchanged. However, the approaches are different. BoJ wanted to steepen the yield curve considerably as they are beginning to understand that a flattish yield curve hurts banks profitability and clearly they wanted to correct it. The Fed, on the other hand, are trying to signal that the normalized interest rates for the US are now a lot lower than they used to be historically. Our guess is that a rate hike will happen only in December. We also believe that this particular rate hike cycle will be much more benign than the previous three or four that we have seen.What does it mean for emerging markets, including India?
Over past rate hike episodes spanning 45-50 years, only once did the US dollar appreciate. In all other episodes, the dollar either depreciated or just stayed flat. So, if that is the case, there is no strong case for the appreciation of the US dollar, and the rate hike episode is likely to be much more dovish that we have seen in the past; then the necessary conclusion from there is that the money flows into emerging markets and Asian equities may not really suffer as badly as we have seen in the past. For the last 8-10 months, our basic point of view has been that the emerging markets equities should outperform the developed market equities. That stance remains intact.In Asia, which equity markets are your best bets?
We are overweight on China, India, South Korea and Thailand. Why do you think China is attractive?
Even as China is facing the problem of a growth slowdown, we think if the stock selection is done correctly, there are enough bets in China which portfolio managers can focus on. If we go back 25 years, the basic expenses of a Chinese household amounted to around 60% of its income. Over the years, that has dropped to around 40-43%. What is growing is education, health, leisure, consumer discretionaries and so on. We call this theme Changing China or New China.What makes the Indian market an attractive bet?
India is relatively a safer and easier story than China, because while China is slowing down, India is moving exactly in the reverse direction. If you go back to two years, the real GDP growth was around 5-5.5%, now it is at around 7-7.5%, and it will possibly settle at around 8% or so. Interestingly, during this growth recovery phase, India is still in a period where interest rates are declining. That is the Goldilocks scenario. It is a rare combination to find in emerging markets today. Tepid rural consumption was holding back earnings growth for the last couple of years. Due to the good monsoon and implementation of the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission, rural consumption is expected to grow from here, once the harvest season sets in and the additional money hits the bank accounts.  Also, investment demand is fine as far as foreign direct investment and government expenditure are concerned. Private capex is the only deterrent at this point of time. Also, corporate earnings in the June quarter were not as bad as previous five years.Are valuations looking stretched for India?
Yes and no. Valuations would look stretched if you compare India to some of the regional peers, but compared to their own historical averages, they look quite okay. Which sectors do you like in India?
We like consumer discretionaries, including consumer proxies, and within that pack we are more tilted to rural consumption. Next are the companies which are a play on potential industrial capex recovery. However, we need to avoid leveraged companies. Building materials are allied to them. We also like private sector banks.

Despite the company missing revenue forecasts, investors have driven up the stock 7% since it declared disappointing March-quarter earnings. The revenue for the January to March quarter missed estimates. Overall, BELs consolidated revenue grew just 6.4% in the past fiscal year, compared with the managements guidance of 8-10%.
				   
				That said, the miss in revenue growth was somewhat compensated by strong margins and robust order inflows. Profitability rose to multi-year highs as BEL benefited from low costs and indigenization of work orders. Order inflows tripled as the firm signed several large contracts during the year. As a result, the order backlog jumped 48% from a year ago to Rs.32,022 crore. That is 4.2 times revenues for 2015-16 and, at first blush, signals earnings visibility in the quarters ahead.The order inflows are expected to be strong this year, too. The finalization of large contracts by the defence forces can keep the order backlog high. The company is eyeing sizeable value of projects going ahead both in its conventional areas and several first-of-its-kind projects, Edelweiss Securities Ltd said in a note.While this order book may have excited investors, it is not leading to any earnings upgrades. If anything, some analysts have pared their estimates for the current financial year. The bugbear remains slow revenue growth, which few analysts believe, will revive this year.According to ICICI Securities Ltd, BELs large order backlog will take more than two years for execution. Also, as BEL began accepting turnkey contracts (responsible for implementation of full systems, rather than parts), margins are expected to shrink. These orders require purchases from third parties which can crimp profitability, ICICI Securities adds.Thus, brokerages are reducing profit growth forecasts. We have marginally tweaked our earnings estimate downward by 2-3% for FY17/18E to factor in lower-than-expected revenue performance; earnings downgrade was restricted on account of better-than-expected margins exit rate for Q4FY16, Sharekhan Ltd said in a note.Analysts expect current orders to drive BELs revenue and earnings from fiscal 2018 onwards. But the assumptions for these forecasts, too, are not watertight.

-0.06,"Mumbai: The National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) has battled several issues this yearthere was a stand off with shareholders on its listing plans; allegations surfaced of allowing unfair access to some brokers; and managing director Chitra Ramkrishna resigned unexpectedly. 
				   
				In an interview, chairman Ashok Chawla said the initial share sale of the nations largest exchange will likely happen in the beginning of the April-June quarter after it hires a new managing director and completes corrective action based on a forensic audit to examine allegations of unfair access to its algorithm trading platform. Edited excerpts: NSE has been in the eye of a storm in the recent past. NSE is an efficient and well-oiled organization and it is not for nothing that the exchange over the years has grown from zero percent market share to 85%. In an organization, issues do come up sometime that are not necessarily defining aspects. There have been some technological issues in the past, which were resolved in 2014 and are also under investigation to prevent any future occurrences. Listing of the exchange is being pursued with a fair degree of rigour, as it is only appropriate that the existing shareholders get an exit option. Resignation of the managing director and CEO had nothing to do with thispeople come and go for many reasons. In her case it was personal reasons.The NSE management has mostly been averse to listing in the past. NSE wasnt opposed to listing, but they had two concerns the need for restructuring of the company into regulated and unregulated businesses, and a perception that if they list on a competing exchange it could lead to some troubles. Last few months the board has looked at these issues; restructuring is worth looking at at some point but that should not be something that the listing process should be held hostage to. Listing on the other exchange is the regulators decision so we will abide by that. What would be the size of the offer?The offer for sale (OFS) is not to raise money as we have adequate cash on our books. All the 70 shareholders of NSE have been asked to offer some of their shares in the OFS, which is coming to be around 20-25%. ALSO READ: NSE must list sans hubris or risk investor scornThe current Sebi rules do not allow for an overseas listing, so is the overseas listing off the table?There was some thinking initially to tap global markets through overseas listing but for now we are restricting ourselves to domestic listing. We could revisit it later. We had earlier said that by January we would file a Draft Red Herring Prospectus with Sebi but now we have preponed the timeline and would file by 20 December for a domestic listing.Issues have been raised that the NSE board examining the issues of alleged unfair access to certain brokers while accessing the algorithmic trading platform is a case of NSE investigating itself.As per the Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India) directive, we have commissioned a forensic audit to examine the allegations and the report is expected from Deloitte India in few days. We would submit the entire report to the regulator and if the board has some observations and comments to offer then we would add those. Whether there would be a fair examination of the allegations considering that NSE has commissioned the audit, you should ask the regulator. There would be some confidence that Sebi has in the NSE board.Considering the timelines you have highlighted would it be safe to say that the exchange would not list till the new CEO is in place and the issues around allegations of unfair access are resolved?Yes, we would not list till these two issues are resolved as this is the prudent thing to do. The new MD and CEO would be in place before the end of the first quarter of the coming calendar. Corrective actions based on the forensic audit in consultation with Sebi would also be finished around the same time. As to listing this would happen around the beginning of the second quarter of the calendar year. Is NSE okay with listing on a rival exchangebecause of the concerns of conflict of interest that may arise out of cross listing remain?We have requested Sebi to provide some comfort in existing regulations. For instance, in case the exchange, acting as regulator, proposes an action against an exchange which is listed on its platform perhaps it could be looked at by some external party or independent member. Sebi is positively considering the proposal, if it comes then it would give the parties some ease and if it doesnt then the philosophy behind cross listing isyou cant be a judge of your own cause and we will honour that. ALSO READ: NSE CEO exit: Examining Sebi, NSE boards roles There have been many reports pointing to differences with the board being the reason for Chitra Ramkrishnas exit from NSE.Differences with the board are something like what two people have while talking across a table, nothing more than that. At least there were no issues between the board and the ex-CEO that could have prompted such a move on her part, so to that extent I deny (these claims). Reportedly, the board was concerned about the appointment of the group chief operating officer Anand Subramanian. So, are you saying that the board had no concerns on his appointment?Well, there is no merit in visiting that issue today. This was something that happened in the past and we would like to leave it there. While BSEs Gujarat International Finance Tech (GIFT) plans seem crystallized, we have not heard much from NSE on its plans for GIFT.

-0.15,"New York: Is Twitters best path to find a new owner? Probably. Will Twitter get sold? Maybe. Is it sensible for any company to buy Twitter for $15 billion or much more? Nope.
				   
				CNBCs David Faber reported on Friday that Twitter is moving closer to a sale and may have a formal takeover offer soon. A sale isnt imminent, CNBC said, but this is perhaps the most credible reporting to date that Twitters directors may be willing to close the curtain on the companys troubled run on the public markets. In the absence of a clear business strategy, the only thing that drives up Twitters stock price these days is hopes the company might be acquired. And predictably, Twitters stock soared about 22% in early trading Friday, giving the company a market value of more than $16 billion. Before Friday, Twitter was trading at a relatively modest four times its expected revenue for the coming year, but those numbers are not reliable given the companys track record of missing its own forecasts.The constant rumors about Twitter getting sold drive up the share price and make an acquisition potentially even more expensive. Given Twitters struggles to add users, its deteriorating finances and advertisers growing disenchantment with the company as a way to market to consumers, a sale of Twitter at current prices is imminently irrational. Of course when it comes to acquisitions, rich companies do unpredictable things. Sometimes that works out for the best  Facebook buying WhatsApp, for example  and sometimes it doesnt  such as Microsoft buying ... anything.CBNC said Google and Salesforce.com are engaged in conversations about a deal for Twitter. Google is a natural owner for Twitter and has been a rumored buyer for years. Google or Facebook  relatively immune from caring about what their shareholders think  could easily absorb Twitter, hide the companys financial results and tack it onto their existing advertising sales machines. Still, its not clear why even Google would be willing to buy Twitter now, rather than wait for it to get cheaper.Salesforce, on the other hand, is a bit of a head-scratcher as a potential Twitter buyer. It is true that one of Salesforces biggest lines of business is selling software used by customer-service departments to handle complaints and feedback. Twitter is likewise avidly used by customer-service teams  as you may have noticed if you ever tweeted gripes about your cable company and got a response from them on Twitter.But its not clear why Salesforce would spend roughly 30% of its market cap to ensure Twitter and Salesforce customer-service features are used in tandem; the same benefits can be achieved with smart software collaboration. Its also possible that Salesforce chief executive officer Marc Benioff  who tried really, really, really hard to buy LinkedIn  simply wants the attention that comes from making a play for a high-profile target like Twitter. Salesforce shareholders dont look happy about such a vanity deal. The companys stock price was down about 4% in early trading Friday. Once again were in the same place with Twitter weve been for years: An acquisition makes little sense at Twitters current prices, especially as shares go up on every takeover rumor.

-0.28,"IL&FS Transportation Networks Ltds (ITNL) robust performance in the March quarter is the result of a better-than-expected-income from all its business segments. 
				   
				One, construction income was the sweet spot that drove net revenue higher by about 72% from a year earlier, catapulting it higher than the streets forecast. Two, the pace of project completion was faster, and, three, tolling revenue came in higher than expected.So, a huge revenue beat pushed up the quarters operating profit by about 80% from a year earlier. Further, ITNLs decent order book provides growth assurance over the next 12-18 months.But then, the high proportion of income from the construction segment turns out to be a double-edged sword. While it fuels revenue growth, it does not augur well for profit margins. Operating margin at 30.5%, although wider than the year-ago period, fell short of that pencilled in by brokerages. ITNLs margin was also impacted adversely by a Rs.44 crore provisioning made during the quarter towards loans that the firm is doubtful of receiving.The concerns on profitability are likely to continue as most of the orders are in the low-margin construction segment. This is not all. ITNLs balance sheet is already highly stressed with a debt-to-equity ratio in excess of 4. This weighs down investor sentiment, which makes the ITNL stock wobbly. Besides, in spite of turning in a better than expected revenue and order book growth, the stock has underperformed the benchmark indices in the last one year.The silver lining in the cloud of debt is that the recently raised money, through a rights issue, should lower leverage. But according to the post-results review by Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd, Leverage continues to surge higher and ITNL earnings highly leveraged to new orders, equity funding gap would still put pressure on balance sheet.What would work in favour of the company is strong revenue traction as new projects are due to get commissioned, easing cash flows from business operations over the next 12 months.

0.59,"Mumbai: The US-based stressed asset specialist Lone Star Funds has applied to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to set up an asset reconstruction company (ARC) with an eye on the massive bad loan-related opportunity in India, three people aware of the development said.
				   
				They have been scouting the Indian market for the last couple of months for stressed assets opportunities in the power and infrastructure sectors. As part of their strategy to tap this opportunity they have applied to RBI for setting up an ARC, said one of the three persons cited above, requesting anonymity as he is not authorized to speak to reporters.The ARC will be part of an India platform that Lone Star is looking to build, said the second person mentioned above. They are in the process of setting up a team to manage stressed infra assets in India. They are also looking to raise a new fund currently, a significant part of which will likely be dedicated to India, he added.Lone Star Funds declined to comment on the development. Lone Star is a global private equity firm that invests in real estate, equity, credit and other financial assets. Since the establishment of its first fund in 1995, Lone Star has raised 16 PE funds with aggregate capital commitments totalling over $65 billion, according to the funds website.Lone Star seeks opportunities in markets where liquidity is restricted and financing is constrained, where balance sheets of financial institutions are in stress and there is a need to dispose of high volumes of assets to manage capital, deleverage and build liquidity.Mint reported 19 October that Lone Star is in discussions with infrastructure conglomerate GMR Group to acquire a significant stake in GMR Chhattisgarh Energy Ltd, a unit of GMR Energy Ltd.With its plans to start an ARC, Lone Star joins the ranks of funds and financial services institutions that are looking to tap the huge bad loans mess that faces the Indian banking system. The gross bad loans of 39 listed Indian banks, in absolute terms, rose 92% in fiscal 2016 to Rs5.79 trillion.The Lone Star move comes after the government, seeking to resolve problem of mounting bad loans in Indias banking sector, decided in May to allow foreign institutions to fully own ARCs.Although local banks have trillions of rupees worth of bad loans on their books, the capital lying with existing ARCs in India is enough to buy only a fraction of the stressed assets available.Indias attempt to rid its banking sector of stressed assets is providing an opportunity for those with experience and the funds to turn around assets. Amongst those who have applied for setting up ARCs are global stressed asset specialist JC Flowers and Co., in partnership with Ambit Holdings Pvt. Ltd,  domestic financial services firm IIFL Holdings Ltd and Sudhir Valia, the former chief financial officer of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.Other global private equity funds, such as KKR and Co., Hong Kong-based SSG Capital Management and International Finance Corp. (IFC), the investment arm of the World Bank, have already acquired stakes in existing ARCs to buy bad loans.In January 2015, IFC invested in Encore Asset Reconstruction Co. Pvt. Ltd.  In March this year, the Foreign Investment Promotion Board gave approval to KKR & Co. for picking up a stake in International Asset Reconstruction Co. Pvt.

-1.0,"London/New York: Wall Streets high-flyers in Davos, basking in their firms strong fourth-quarter earnings, said theyre confident Donald Trumps incoming administration will loosen regulatory constraints on financierseven if it leaves Barack Obamas signature Dodd-Frank Act largely intact.
				   
				Bank executives, speaking on condition of anonymity at events around the Swiss ski resort, said theyre not counting on Trump to overturn Dodd-Frank. Instead, they expect the federal agencies that enforce the rules to ease up on them and support bankers efforts to limit how much capital and liquidity their companies need to pay bills or absorb losses in a crisis.The bankers said they recognize that changing or overturning the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act would require support in the US Senate that Republicans may lack. Instead theyre counting on Trumps team to dial back how supervisory agencies enforce and interpret rules. Led by Federal Reserve governor Daniel Tarullo, US regulators have adopted an extra-strict version of the global standards on capital and liquidity set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.ALSO READ | A warning to Donald Trump from Friedrich HayekLegislation, obviously thats harder to do than just changing regulations, JPMorgan Chase & Co. chief executive officer Jamie Dimon said in a Bloomberg Television interview with John Micklethwait on Wednesday. Regulators can change a lot of things easily about compliance, about costs, certain rules about lending, how you use your liquidity, how you use your capital. I would like to see some of those looked at and maybe modified a bit, and I think it would be good for the economy.At a panel discussion on the global banking outlook in Davos Thursday morning, JPMorgan asset-management CEO Mary Callahan Erdoes echoed that view.Its going to be a great several years, Erdoes said. Its going to be very positive for businesses in the US, which should cascade to businesses around the world.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO Lloyd Blankfein offered a similarly optimistic view in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Davos on Thursday.If you look at the policies that Trump has committed himself to, they are quite stimulative and quite market-supportive, Blankfein said. If you look at spending on infrastructure, lower tax rate and overlapping regulation, they are quite stimulative, far more stimulative than what people were expecting had the Democrats won the election.The Goldman Sachs CEO also said theres an opportunity to re-legislate financial regulations as the US did with the Securities Exchange Act after the Great Depression.I think were going to open it up, Blankfein said. You can call it Dodd-Frank, as amended.ALSO READ | These automakers could be Donald Trumps next targetsWall Street bank shares, including JPMorgans and Goldman Sachss, have rallied since the election on speculation that Trumps policies will accelerate economic growth and drive higher interest rates.While Trumps transition team said after the election that it would work to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act and replace it with new policies to encourage economic growth and job creation, few bankers see Dodd-Frank as a priority. Even billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who Trump appointed as a special adviser last month to overhaul regulations, said in a CNN interview that he wouldnt support killing Dodd-Frank.Several bankers in Davos said theyre optimistic that regulators under Trump could do away with the gold-plating by the US of the latest Basel benchmarks and ease the process by which banks are stress-tested annually to ensure they have adequate capital to absorb losses in a hypothetical crisis.In Europe, where bankers argue the regions economic woes are exacerbated by the constraints on lenders, regulators have already helped delay agreement on a new set of global requirements.The Federal Reserve has led US rule-making efforts, including Basel implementation. Trump can appoint a vice-chairman for regulation, effectively replacing Tarullo, who has filled the role unofficially and antagonized bankers with his strict approach to regulation. That, along with other appointments, could help tip the Fed toward a more bank-friendly approach.ALSO READ | Wary of Donald Trump, China hails Obama for progress in Sino-US tiesIt also could be wishful thinking. While criticizing Dodd-Frank, Republican leaders in Congress have backed even higher capital requirements than the Fed for the largest banks. Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has proposed exempting banks from most other rules in exchange for 10% capital, almost twice as much as what big banks have now.New regulators could also change the way Dodd-Frank is implemented. One part bankers hate the most, the Volcker Rule, bans the largest firms from making speculative bets with their own money. Trumps Treasury secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, the Goldman Sachs co-president named to serve as Trumps chief economic policy adviser, are expected to be more sympathetic to banks arguments that limiting their trading hurts investors by making fixed-income securities less liquid.While trading revenue has declined in recent years, the Volcker Rule and other restrictions didnt prevent a jump last year, including at Goldman Sachs, where one trader made $250 million for his firm last year.JPMorgans Dimon and other executives also have pushed against international liquidity standards that were part of the post-crisis Basel regime and designed to ensure that firms have enough easy-to-sell assets to meet claims coming due in a month and over a year.Theres $2.5 trillion sitting at the central bank called excess reserves, Dimon said in Davos. And were not free to lend it because of all these new requirements.Asked whether laws will change or just how theyre enforced, Bank of America Corp. CEO Brian Moynihan told Erik Schatzker in Davos that I think it will be the implementation of regulation, adding later that he expects a regulatory debate about what the right regulation is and how it will be mitigated over time. Bloomberg",2017-01-19,Cm9YqAFaQZXGdngQqBvMEP,Wall Street bank shares have rallied since the election on speculation that Donald Trumps policies will accelerate economic growth and drive higher interest rates,both,22:06,Bankers in Davos see Donald Trump making Wall Street great again

-0.91,"New Delhi: After taking over the air (at least in urban India) and the airwavewith sexist advertising that claimed deodorants made men irresistible to womenIndias deodorant makers are now eyeing the perfume market. 
				   
				Deodorants are nothing to be sniffed at. They account for a Rs3,000 crore market in India. Now, the companies behind brands such as Fogg (Vini Cosmetics), Axe (Hindustan Unilever Ltd), and Engage (ITC Ltd), are looking at the branded mass fragrance market. Its a market theirs for the taking. Imported perfumes from luxury brands are usually priced between Rs3,000 and Rs5,000 which the masses cannot afford. Therefore, anybody looking to graduate from a deodorant has no affordable branded option. These brands are building a new category. It is a step towards premiumisation with offer better packaging and a higher price, said Rajat Wahi, partner and head (consumer markets), at consulting firm KPMG in India.Most companies have simply  chosen to extend their deodorant brands to the perfume segment. And, much like with their deodorants, their primary target is young men. Ahmedabad based Vini Cosmetics Ltd, the big daddy of the deodorant business, launched perfume sprays and gift packs last year. While the perfume bottles are priced at Rs499,  the gift packs range from Rs1,000 to Rs2,000. We are investing Rs30 to Rs40 crore in the perfume segment. Since perfume is also an occasional wear product in India we are positioning Fogg perfumes as value for money quality product which can also be gifted on special occasions, said Darshan Patel, founder, Vini Cosmetics. Perfumes contribute less than 10% to the companys overall revenue but Patel is confident that his products will gain a sizeable share in the Rs600 crore perfume market (both organized and unorganized).Like Fogg, HULs popular deodorant brand Axe has also launched premium fine fragrances under Axe Signature Gold range in December. Available in four variants, the Axe perfumes are priced at Rs450. Consumers are becoming more discerning and adding fine fragrances is increasingly becoming a part of their grooming regime. Our perfume range is targeted at young Indian men who are adding fine fragrances as a part of their grooming over and above the current deo usage, said an HUL spokesperson. ITC declined to participate in the story.With a slew of  launches, the companies are also spending big money on advertising although they declined to share their budgets. According to media agencies deodorant brands spend around Rs1, 000 to Rs1,500 crore on television advertising making every year. It is likely some of that money is now going to perfumes. I believe these brands have invested ahead of the curve first for deodorants and now perfumes. This category is heavily skewed towards sports, and news and English entertainment channels as they target young aspirational consumers. We will see a lot more activity in this segment, said Navin Khemka, managing partner, Maxus, a GroupM owned media agency.But the perfumes business may be tougher to crack than the deodorants one. Perfume launches in India havent worked so far.Deo brands have created brand equity by introducing cheaper and casual daily-wear products.

It is now a question of buyers and sellers expectations meeting at a certain valuation benchmark, said Navneet Singh, executive director and head, infrastructure group, Avendus Capital. ALSO READ: Indias solar prices set to drop amid competition, lower costsAlso, while deals in the thermal energy sector are expected to remain subdued due to the presence of only a handful of buyers, predominantly looking for operating assets, the renewable sector, primarily solar, will see activity in fund-raising as companies will continue to need additional capital to build their projects, Singh added. Several Indian infrastructure developers, weighed down by debt, have announced exits from individual highway projects to monetize assets and repay creditors while renewable energy firms evaluate fund-raises and going public.The infrastructure sector raised about $3.78 billion in 2016 across 36 transactions, including mergers and acquisitions (M&A), private equity (PE) investment and two initial public offerings (IPOs), analysis of monthly data from investment bank Equirus Capital Pvt. Ltd showed. This compares with $2.9 billion raised in 2014 and about $3.7 billion raised in 2015. According to data from Grant Thornton India, about $2.91 billion was raised from 39 M&A and PE transactions in 2016 across engineering, infrastructure, and clean-tech sectors.Funds such as US-based I Squared Capital, Indian asset manager IDFC Alternatives infrastructure fund, Canadas Brookfield Asset Management, Australias Macquarie Group, and the Canadian pension funds Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec (CDPQ) have committed large investments in the sector and are looking to buy assets across roads, thermal power and renewable energy to build their own portfolio in India. CDPQ, for example, had last year committed investments of $150 million for renewable energy in India and also joined hands with Tata Power Co. Ltd and ICICI Venture to launch a platform to facilitate investments in power projects with an initial capital of up to $850 million. Infrastructure Fund II of multi-asset manager IDFC Alternatives, for example, plans to buy certain operational road assets by March. A number of deals in the sector have been signed or announced over the last 12 months but many are yet to close. One noticeable trend seen is that closing and funding control acquisitions require significantly higher involvement and patience than buying simple passive minority stakes, said Aditya Aggarwal, partner (infrastructure) at IDFC Alternatives. Going forward, I would expect a lot more mid-sized M&A activity in renewables given that significant solar capacity would get commissioned from the equity lock-in restrictions in 2017. Likewise, I expect the TOT (toll-operate-transfer) model to be a game changer in road sector investments this year, Aggarwal said. The government is looking to monetize 75 national highways operated by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) through international competitive bidding under the so-called TOT model, where investors including foreign funds will participate. ALSO READ: Centre calls national review meet to push clean energy projectsSimilarly, road developers including Sadbhav Infrastructure Projects Ltd and Gayatri Projects Ltd are looking for buyers for some of their operational assets. Hyderabad-based Gayatri Projects is carrying out the process of demerging its roads assets into a separate entity to bring in a financial partner or look at selling the portfolio either entirely or as individual assets to foreign funds, managing director T.V. Sandeep Kumar Reddy said.

Indeed, the quarterly results that followed the clean-up showed government banks held the most toxic assets. Their private-sector counterparts were hailed for their high asset quality.
				   
				But the September quarter results show private-sector lenders, at least some of them, are as deep in troubled waters as their public sector peers. At the aggregate level, private-sector banks saw bad loan stock double on a gross basis to Rs66,314 crore and provisions treble to Rs1.2 trillion from a year ago. For the public sector group, the surge in bad loan stock was similar, but provisions rose only 49%. This could mean private-sector lenders were slow in recognizing distressed assets and making provisions. The casualties were Axis Bank Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd, Yes Bank Ltd and South Indian Bank.Axis Bank saw a significant portion of loans on its watchlist turn bad, provisions climbed fivefold and the provision coverage ratio dropped to 60% from 72% in the March quarter. At ICICI Bank, gross bad loans doubled and it had to provide Rs7,082.69 crore for them. Yes Bank and South Indian Bank also posted weak asset quality metrics.But the real worry is these private-sector lenders net non-performing assets (NPA). The accretion in net NPAs for these lenders was far higher than that of gross NPAs. This means upgrades and recoveries are slowing even as fresh slippages are showing no signs of abatement. On an aggregate basis, private-sector banks net NPA stock jumped 132% while that of the public sector banks surged a shade lower by 103%.Private banks have always been perceived to be more efficient and having a firm hand on errant borrowers. But the net NPA accretion shows they are no better than their public sector counterparts.Granted, public sector lenders are still the worst lot but it is time that private-sector banks, especially corporate lenders, are valued more realistically.

				On Wednesday, Alok Ohrie, president and MD, India Commercial of Dell EMC, insisted that the combined company, christened Dell Technologies, is now uniquely positioned to provide customers with solutions that will secure their digital future with a single window of engagement. The combination creates a $74 billion company with a technology portfolio which  includes virtualization company VMware, security firms RSA Systems and SecureWorks, software and services (including cloud and big data analytics) firm Pivotal, and cloud management software company Virtustream.In an interview, Ohrie said he believes there are three pillars of digital transformation: IT infrastructure transformation, workforce transformation and security transformation. Effectively, we now play in all the elements of a modern data centre, he said.Dell doesnt break up country-wise revenue, but according to estimates by Dataquest, a Cyber Media (India) Ltd Publication, Dell Indias revenue stood at Rs17,480 crore in FY 2015-16. It pegged EMC Indias revenue in 2014-15 at Rs2,452 crore (combined about Rs20,000 crore, or $3 billion).Tom Sweet, chief financial officer, Dell Technologies, recently said that the combined revenue of the two companies in India was closer to $2.5 billion.According to International Data Corp. (IDC), in the overall PC shipment for the April-June quarter of 2016, HP Inc. reclaimed its top spot with 28.4% market share, while Dell captured the second spot with 22.2% backed by focused efforts on growing branded consumer desktop category.In the India x86 (Intel-based servers) market, HP maintained its lead position in the October-December quarter of 2015 with 36% market share in terms of unit shipment, followed by Dell with a market share of 24% and Lenovo with 12%. EMC led in Indias external storage industry with a 28.4% market share in the January quarter.Nevertheless, the fact is that the shift to cloud is transforming and cannibalizing hardware markets, and technology companies, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), Oracle Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc.,  need to evolve their strategies in order to survive, according to Forrester analysts.Ohrie pointed out that Dell Technologies, with 140,000 employees, annual revenue of $74 billion and over 20,000 patents and patent applications, has over the last few years made significant investments in R&D that will stand it in good stead.Dell and EMC have made a cumulative R&D investment of $12.7 billion over the last three years and we have publicly stated that for this year, $4.5 billion of investment will be made in R&D, which is multiple times what the competition is investing, Ohrie said. Going forward, Ohrie said, we are going to focus on the digital transformation space and help our customers take that journey at a faster pace.But what will happen to jobs made redundant by the Dell-EMC merger?

Vodafone is discussing an all-share deal with Idea that would see it de-consolidate the business in its accounts.

It would have about 390 million customers and about 40% market share by revenue before any antitrust concessions.To try to make the numbers work in an all-share deal, the proposal excludes Vodafones 42% share of an Indian towers company called Indus, worth about $4 billion. That brings the value of the Vodafone mobile business closer to Ideas market capitalization, which jumped more than 25% to $5.2 billion on Monday (from $4.1 billion).If a deal is finalized, Vodafone could then sell down its stake in the merged company over time, hopefully at a better price if its better able to withstand the heat from Jio.

				Five private sector lenders, including HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and IndusInd Bank, have been actively selling the offerings of service providers such as SBI Cards Pvt. Ltd and Oneassist Consumer Solutions Pvt. Ltd to ensure that customers are insured against loss of wallet and receive emergency cash in distress situations.Call centres of these private sector lenders are reaching out to customers through in-bound calls and advertising these products, allowing them to insure themselves against loss of wallet or cases of phishing or other online frauds. While banks have had these products available for some time, they have recently started proactively marketing them.The services include blocking cards lost with one phone call, settling hotel bills and buying air tickets if the customer is in another city when he/she lost the card. Over and above, these products also reimburse customers in case of fraudulent transactions, depending on the package they buy. SBI Cards, through its card protection plan (CPP), and Oneassist, through its product wallet assist, also give customers some handy cash, which they can use to take care of themselves till they are back in their home town.These funds are extended to customers in the form of an interest-free loan, which they must repay within a stipulated period once they are back in town. These protective services are offered at an annual fee ranging between Rs.1,599 and Rs.2,499.These are types of in-built insurance services which is now offered on plastic products. Banks are not in the business of insurance, which is why we offer these third party services, said Puneet Kapoor, senior executive vice president, Kotak Mahindra Bank.According to Kapoor, his bank is proactively selling these to its debit card and credit card customers.Axis Bank, too, is in the process of marketing these third-party products to its customer base, while also offering premium cards which have these services enabled from the get go. Sangram Singh, head of card and payments at Axis Bank, said that the private sector lender also allows its customers to adjust key usages of their debit and credit cards to ensure that they are in control of the amount that is spent on them. Apart from offering these protective services, these private sector banks are also actively educating their customers on how to protect themselves against online frauds and scam phone calls where customers are asked to divulge sensitive banking information.According to an ICICI Bank spokesperson, the bank has been conducting a safe banking campaign through text messages, emails and social media posts to reach out to its customer base, for this purpose.The bank has engaged with the reputed anti-phishing agency to proactively detect and bring down phishing sites as soon as they are detected, the spokesperson said.The push for such services becomes even more relevant at a time when banks are already in the process of beefing up card security for customers who have been impacted by the recent data breach allegedly involving 3.2 million cards.

0.22,"Mumbai: As the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) delays releasing guidelines for the so-called S4A (sustainable structuring of stressed assets) scheme, lenders to some of Indias most debt-ridden companies are keeping those accounts on standby.  
				   
				According to three bankers with knowledge of the matter, creditors of textile maker Alok Industries Ltd and Bhushan Steel Ltd have evaluated the books of these companies and are waiting for RBI to clear the path ahead for them to implement S4A.  As of March 2016, Bhushan Steel had consolidated debt of Rs44,477.93 crore and Alok Industries Rs22,075.15 crore.RBI introduced the S4A scheme in June, allowing banks to convert as much as half the loans held by corporate borrowers into equity or equity-like securities. The move was intended to help restore the flow of credit to crucial sectors such as infrastructure and iron and steel, among others, reduce the stress on corporate borrowers and stanch bad loans across banks.In case of Alok Industries, the evaluation study has established that less than half of the companys debt is actually sustainable. We are expecting RBI to give some leeway in the structuring of the guidelines, so this case might benefit from the restructuring, said a senior official at a state-run bank, with direct knowledge of the case. The banker spoke on condition of anonymity as the discussions are confidential.  Lenders to Alok Industries decided on a strategic debt restructuring (SDR) of the company in November 2015, the company had said in a stock exchange notification. Under this scheme, lenders would be allowed to convert part of the debt in a company to majority equity, thereby taking over operational control. In January, it said lenders planned to acquire 65% of the company by converting debt to equity under SDR.  The S4A option was considered after lenders failed to find a suitable buyer for the company.In the case of Bhushan Steel, the lending consortium led by State Bank of India (SBI) and Punjab National Bank (PNB) has conducted a forensic audit, but hasnt moved ahead on the case since it is waiting for the final S4A guidelines, said the deputy managing director of a large state-owned bank, also on conditions of anonymity.  In January-March, lenders to Bhushan Steel started classifying the account as a non-performing asset under RBIs asset quality review. This was done after efforts for debt resolution such as joint lender forum (JLF) discussions and the 5/25 refinancing plan, which allows banks to extend the tenure of infrastructure loans, failed. The JLF was set up after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested Neeraj Singhal, vice-chairman at Bhushan Steel, in the cash-for-loans case in 2014. At the monetary policy announcement on 4 October, RBI governor Urjit Patel said the regulator would announce reworked guidelines around the S4A restructuring scheme by the end of that month. The regulator had said that it was looking at changing certain aspects of the guidelines which might come in the way of practical application, such as allowing banks to classify so-called sustainable debt as a standard account. The final guidelines are yet to emerge.  There is a time component to turning around stressed assets. These cases have already seen a lot of delay in the reworking of their debt, things need to move fast now, said the second banker cited above. Alok Industries and RBI did not respond to queries mailed to them. A spokesperson for Bhushan Steel did not respond to messages sent to his cell phone.The regulator's delay in issuing revised guidelines points at RBIs need for making S4A a more inclusive restructuring mechanism. While the banking regulator does not want to seem like it is being too easy on restructuring cases, it does want to bring in more cases under S4A, the managing partner of a stressed asset consulting firm said on conditions of anonymity.Others say delays in restructuring are also a function of banks inertia.""Regulatory delays are one thing, but lenders are also not really willing to take tough calls in difficult situations. Most public sector banks seem to be too scared of vigilance-related investigations, which acts as a deterrent when they have to decide on taking big haircuts during such turnaround cases, the head of the restructuring practice at a global consulting firm said, also seeking anonymity.According to the S4A norms issued by the central bank in June, banks are allowed to split the debt of a stressed company into sustainable and unsustainable parts.  According to RBI norms, the unsustainable debt can be converted into long-term, equity-like instruments that will be on a banks investment books while the rest of the debt can be restructured.Under S4A norms, promoters will be required to dilute their shareholding in exchange for converting a part of the unsustainable debt into equity. These promoters shares would be given to banks, which will continue to hold them till a company turns around, after which lenders can sell the equity.  Promoters will continue to have the first right of refusal to these shares.  Most other restructuring options on offer have not delivered satisfactory results, resulting in higher accumulation of bad loans on the books of banks, which collectively hold Rs6.3 trillion of non-performing assets.",2016-11-07,EJzIYX2yzAzPfPgv2Dg8DJ,The creditors of Alok Industries and Bhushan Steel are waiting for RBI to issue fresh guidelines,both,00:49,Lenders put top NPA cases on standby over S4A norms delay

In August, Essel Highways had secured $85 million loan from investment bank Goldman Sachs as part of a $220-million debenture issuance to finance new projects and for strategic acquisitions. Patel Engineering and KNR Constructions will sell their entire equity stake in two annuity-based BOT projects, namely Patel KNR Infrastructure Ltd (PKIL) and Patel KNR Heavy Infrastructure Ltd (PKHIL) to the Essel group company, KNR Constructions said in a BSE filing on Saturday.Patel Engineering and affiliates hold about 60% stake in each of the two assets, while the remaining 40% is with KNR. The two projects have a combined debt of about Rs.780 crore, a person familiar with the projects said. KNR Constructions plans to focus on its EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) business by exiting the asset-heavy BOT business, while the sale will help Patel Engineering improve its financial liquidity. Several road companies are going back to the EPC model, where investments and risks are lower and are beginning to demerge or monetize their operational BOT assets.

0.09,"If demonetisation has affected steel-consuming sectors such as automobile and construction/real estate, how come steel consumption is rising?
				   
				In December, steel consumption rose by 5.2% over a year ago and by 17.1% over November, according to data collated by the governments Joint Plant Committee (JPC). In November too, consumption was up by 3.8%, although it did decline sequentially. Specific factors appear to be behind this increase and the underlying demand for steel remains weak.Consumption data reported by JPC represents sales made by steel producers to buyers such as steel dealerswho then sell to actual consumersand large companies such as in the automobile or projects sectors.In December, the purchasing teams of large consumers of steel got wind that steel companies will be increasing prices January onwards, said Puneet Paliwal, consultant at research and consultancy firm CRU Group. Higher input costs, especially of coking coal, had led to talk of price increases. Large consumers of steel bought additional quantities in December to build stocks for future use, which explains the sharp increase.In November, the increase although relatively slower, was seen due to dealers stocking up steel while they could use their stock of demonetised currency, according to Vivek Jain, associate director (large corporates) at India Ratings and Research Pvt. Ltd. They have stocked up on additional inventory, to be sold in future months.Firms have announced a hike in flat steel prices in January, as predicted, but maintaining higher prices will be tough. Steel mills have purchased raw materials at high prices, but the market may be unable to absorb higher steel prices, says Paliwal. Underlying demand conditions are weak, due to demonetisation. The export market, too, is not supporting higher realizations and it may get tougher when the Chinese New Year holidays see more exports from China as local activity ebbs.If both dealers and companies have stocked up on inventory and demand is not robust, things may get tougher. The coming months may, therefore, see reported consumption growth under some strain, till the surplus steel already in the market gets absorbed. A quick revival in demand in user sectors could do the trick as well, although thats an idle hope at this point. Steel producers may, therefore, have to decide between exporting more or cut back on output. Analysts are predicting the latter.Meanwhile, the December quarter results of large steel companies may show a surge in sales based on JPC data. Tata Steel Ltds December quarter saleable steel output rose by 25.8% over a year ago while sales rose by 27.5%, partly due to volumes from its new plant. JSW Steel Ltd reported a 43% year-on-year increase in crude steel output.

-0.47,"Its unusual to see Tata Steels European business report an increase in profits, while the India business reports a decline. In the September quarter, Europes profit rose by 20.8% sequentially while Indias profit fell by 10.6%. Indias profit declined over a year ago too.
				   
				The commissioning of Tata Steels new Kalinganagar (Odisha) plant has meant output is higher but the start-up costs are affecting profits. Initially, the output is of lower grade while the cost of production is higher. Also, lower prices of long products were a reason for the poor performance.The companys European business did better on the back of better prices, leading to better spreads, with improvement visible in both the UK and Netherlands. The sale of its long products business too has meant that the product mix was more favourable in the quarter. Profit improved although output was lower.Overall, total sales rose by 4.5% sequentially and Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) declined by 8.4%, chiefly because raw material costs rose by 14.9% and other expenses rose by 5.9%. The Kalinganagar plants start has also meant higher interest and depreciation charges. That further whittled down its profit, and resulted in a sharp 75.6% decline in its profit before tax. An improvement in its European business profitability, which was visible in the first quarter too, is good news. Iron ore prices are sustaining a firm trend in steel prices. But other raw material prices are increasing too, coking coal prices have shot up and pose a risk if steel prices dont increase enough to cover these costs.Profitability in India should improve gradually as the new plant stabilizes. Tata Steel is also expecting realizations to improve.

What is it? The estimated combined revenue of a proposed merger of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular.Why is it important? The all-share merger will create Indias largest telecom company, larger than the Rs-50,008-crore-earning Bharti Airtel. Debt on both the companies books and likely losses incurred from the tariff-reduction race started by Reliance Jio are being seen as triggers for the move. It looks like a much needed consolidation boost in the 22-circle Indian telecom market, as seen from the stock gains of Indian telecom operators yesterday ranging 8-10% with Idea gaining a record 26%.Tell me more: The merged entry would still have to address, in many markets, the telecom regulators anti-monopoly restrictions of owning no more than 50% of spectrum in a band and 25% of available spectrum in a circle (or geographic market). 1 dayWhat is it? Number of days to go before the RBI-mandated daily ATM withdrawal limit of Rs 10,000 is removed, from February 1.Why is it important? The first sign of reverting to pre-demonetisation days of cash management was made with RBIs circular removing the ATM limit. Two weeks ago, RBI signalled its ease in handling cash by expanding the limit to Rs 10,000 from Rs 4,500. The Rs 24,000-weekly limit on savings-bank withdrawal, however, stays put, but restrictions on current account, cash credit and overdraft accounts will be removed. Tell me more: RBI mentions the savings-bank limit is under consideration for withdrawal in the near future. Banks can use their discretion to set their own operating limits at ATMs as was the practice before old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were withdrawn.42What is it? The number of cases the Income Tax (IT) department registered nationwide under the recently-enforced Benami Transactions Act.Why is it important? Warnings in public advertisements by the IT department against depositing unaccounted old currency in someone elses bank account anonymously are materialising now. The Benami Acts section 24 has been invoked for 87 notices, for attaching bank accounts with crores of rupees of such dubious deposits and an immovable property.Tell me more: These cases, if proven true, would attract a heavy penalty and a rigorous jail-term of a maximum of seven years. 4What is it? The number of new administrators appointed by the Supreme Court to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).Why is it important? The neutral committee headed by former Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), and the current Chairman of Banks Board Bureau, Vinod Rai, will pave the path to reform the embattled BCCI, richest sporting body in India and the most profitable cricket board in the world. The team, with a mix of financial acumen, social perspective and cricketing enthusiasm, is tasked with bringing in accounting rigour and good governance to a body mired in controversies, the latest being its earlier president and secretary sacked on January 3. It would also finalise the Indian Premier Leagues 10th edition besides reporting on the Lodha panel recommendations to the court.Tell me more: The other members are Vikram Limaye, managing director and CEO of IDBI Bank; former Indian womens cricket captain Diana Edulji; and historian and writer Ramchandra Guha.

-0.6,"Davos: Indias biggest lender by assets, State Bank of India (SBI), could tap capital markets next fiscal year to raise up to $1.5 billion, its chief said on Friday, though it first needs to complete a planned merger with its subsidiary banks.
				   
				In an interview with Reuters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Arundhati Bhattacharya also said the lender would look to raise funds from stake sales in its life insurance unit that could list in a year to 18 months, and by paring its holding in UTI Asset Management Co., which is also looking to go public.We do plan to raise some capital. However, this is also dependent on the fact that there is a merger that we are planning to do, said Bhattacharya, 60, who has been at the helm of SBI as its chairman since late 2013. SBI, which is merging its five subsidiary banks with itself and also taking over a small state-run lender for women, previously expected the merger to be completed by March. The deals could now get delayed by a quarter, Bhattacharya said, as banks are still busy replacing withdrawn banknotes after Indias sudden move in November to cancel 86% of its currency. Indias fiscal year starts in April.ALSO READ: Indian banks said to seek reprieve for $13 billion loan revampAs long as the merger is not over and done with, it could be difficult to approach the capital markets, Bhattacharya said, adding the lender could look to raise between $1 billion and $1.5 billion from the markets.SBI last sold shares in January 2014 to raise $1.2 billion.  Bhattacharya said activities were slowly getting back to normal as effects of the banknote ban subside, although it would still take until the end of February to fully gauge the impact.Bhattacharya hoped recent lending rate cuts by banks including SBI, after they were flush with billions of dollars of deposits following the banknote ban, would help kickstart credit growth, which is hovering near two-decade lows.We feel that credit growth will pick up ... definitely by the second half of next (fiscal) year we should see substantial pick up, she said. Ratings agency Fitch estimates Indias banks will need about $90 billion to meet global Basel III rules which are due to be fully implemented by March 2019.Indian banks face a March deadline from the countrys central bank to identify and make provisions for the troubled assets. But Bhattacharya said: Its unlikely now to be finished by March 2017, but probably in another quarter or two it should be at least many of the large ones would have found some kind of resolution.BNP Paribas Cardif, SBIs partner in its life insurance arm, was no longer interested in picking up 10 percent more in SBI Life at current valuations, Bhattacharya said.

-0.25,"Trade volumes at major ports may have grown by an unexciting 2% in August. But market participants are seeing a silver lining in the underlying export import (exim) data. 
				   
				Containers, which account for about half of Indias exim trade volumes, grew by a decent 5.2% in August. So far this fiscal year, they are up 4.3%, better than the 2.4% rise in the year-ago period, shows data compiled by ICICI Securities Ltd. According to Maersk Line, improving trade with mature marketsEurope and Americascan help container volumes maintain the positive growth momentum in the rest of the calendar year also. While the full-year growth may still be in single digits, anaemic global trade means Indias exim numbers are seen as a bright spot, especially by trade liners and logistics solutions providers. We can expect Indian trade to clock 8-9% growth for the full year 2016, which will be four times the growth of global trade, Maersk Line said in a statement.Non-ferrous metal prices may flatten out in second halfThe near-term outlook for non-ferrous metal prices indicates a flat trend in the second half of fiscal year 2017, after an uptrend in the first half, according to ratings agency Icra Ltd. Since global capacity utilization is 80%, if rising prices prompt higher output, prices could get affected. In the domestic market, apparent consumption in the first quarter was healthy, with a 25% increase in aluminium consumption over a year ago, 10% in copper and 13% in zinc, due to higher demand from power transmission and distribution, and the automobile sectors. Icra cautions high consumption levels may not continue, especially in aluminium, as they may be partly due to an inventory build-up. Its longer-term outlook for base metals remains positive.Petcoke prices continue their upward trendDomestic refiners have increased petroleum coke (petcoke) prices again this month, according to analysts.Prices are now 9.5% higher compared to the September quarter, according to HDFC Securities Ltd. This is detrimental for cement companies. Cement companies are expected to take a hit due to higher petcoke prices starting in the September quarter in some measure, especially those without a high forward cover, according to the brokerage firm.

-0.6,"At 62, Max Group founder Analjit Singh is trim and fit and says he is at peace with himselfa state of mind achieved because he doesnt feel the need for habra any more. Translated from Punjabi, that means he is no longer in a tearing hurry, as he was 30 years ago.
				   
				In January, Analjit Singh stepped down as chairman of the group he founded in 1982 and built into a Rs15,000 crore empire, with interests in life insurance; health and allied businesses; and speciality packaging films. In August, the board of Max Life Insurance Co. Ltd signed off on a merger with HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd that will create Indias largest private-sector insurer, with Rs1.1 trillion in assets.The promoters of Max Financialessentially Analjit Singh, his family and related family firmswill hold a 6.5% stake in the merged company and also get a non-compete fee of Rs850 crore. Analjit Singh, who within Max Group is called BAS (short for Bhai Analjit Singh, bhai being an honorific meaning brother), doesnt like being called a promoter, preferring the term sponsor, and seems to have achieved what most business family owners can only think of wistfullya degree of detachment from the business that allows him to take decisions without any emotional baggage.Analjit Singh stands out among the top echelons of business leadership in India for his ability to spot an opportunity like he did with telecom (Singh made Rs561 crore in 1998 by selling his 41% stake in a joint venture with Hutchison Whampoa Ltd)  and insurance and healthcare early on, and  more than that to quit when on top. He ascribes that to foresight and luck; but in reality, it is the mark of a businessman who can read the tea leaves.Analjit Singh, with the reputation of a serial entrepreneur, is also exploring new businesses, including information technology, real estate and education, under Max Ventures and Industries Ltd (MVIL). In an interview at his elegant home on New Delhis tony Abul Kalam Azad Road, Analjit Singh patiently explained his philosophy of life, his current state of mind and how the two relate to his business. Edited excerpts:As a strategic businessman, what are the things you are looking at now? When you look at these opportunities, what excites you the most?
I am not so sure that people in my situation look at entrepreneurial opportunities from purely a new-world perspective, as you pointed out. I think they look at entrepreneurial and future opportunities in rather a traditional way but think of these developments as enablers.What is the traditional way?
It is perspective of the market, key differentiators, compatibility of extensive weaknesses of the individual and the firm to be able to do something like this. So, therefore, in the traditional criteria of finding these opportunities what I meant was market, differentiator, opportunities, regulation...new factor, completely new factor in the decision-making set. The market is over-crowded. Everybody is in the business of over-promising and under-delivering. Capital is no longer a constraint like it was before. To some extent, even technology is no longer a constraint to those people who have some experience and network, you can find the technology. Anything is possible. If you run a world-class airline, technology is available. So, execution is the key. Team is a big factor. Team was never a question in our mind in the past 10-15 years. Today, if I were looking to be in a big business, probably the first question that I will ask apart from market and differentiator is people and team; and then you look at these new-world solutions that you are talking about as how they can become enablers to what they can do.Besides that, this question is not so pertinent to me. I am not super-engaged to be so rattled about what am I going to do and what will be my next big play. It is not top-most of my mind.But you will do new things, right?
I will do new things, but I will say I am not besotted with it anymore. My interest is more to tame myself and tame my mind and tame my life. Do you know this word habra? I have no habra.Were you like that when you did the diversification?
Of course not! Thirty years ago, I was always in a rush.If you forget about the future for now and look at the past 16 years, what are the things that you have picked up?
I dont call myself a promoter. I prefer the word sponsor. I think if a sponsor does not have an affinity with the business, that business unless by luck things take-off, I think that business drags. The affinity of a sponsor to a particular business segment is very important. If (Bharti Airtel Ltd founder) Sunil Mittal did not have an affinity for telecom or for technology, Airtel would not have been what it is today (Indias biggest phone services provider). If I did not have an affinity for being in the businesses of life and, therefore, focus on healthcare and insurance for 15-16 years, it wouldnt have worked.Affinity and focus leads to execution, passion capital, heavy-lifting, good team equals to success. Therefore, you can apply that mantra to anythingold world or new world. What would you call an old-world business? Pick anything. If I say to myself that I am going to leave everything in my life and get into steel and cement, I will find a new way of doing it and I will be successful in 5-7 years. I will find a way because the need for steel and cement is not gone. If you do it as another unit with the traditional way and traditional people, it is a recipe for disaster. So, we have to find an IndiGo (Indias biggest airline) way of getting in steel or cement. IndiGo is a very good example of what I am saying. What is the revolution and reinvention of being in the airline business? People have been in the airline business. They are in the airline business. They will be in the airline business, but most companies fail. So, why is IndiGo successful? Do you think (IndiGo co-founder) Rahul Bhatia goes and fixes the tyres of the plane every day? No. But somewhere between Aditya (Ghosh, IndiGo president) and him, the way they work is set. So, the way we work in insurance and healthcare is set, and everybody then would perform to that tune. Thats because you have affinity. Thats a clear lesson and experience that I can share.Somebody asked me the other day that you are not even now non-executive chairman of your companies. I am of the MVIL (Max Ventures India Ltd) because I am having fun again after 30 years to nurture a new company. Of those, you are of Vodafone.My point there was: to be a non-executive chairman of a company where you are a sponsor is very different from a non-executive chairman of a company where you are not a sponsor. My remake, role, life, expectations, contact, engagement, communication has to be very different if I am a non-executive chairman of a Max company. The deliverables and expectations are different when it comes to  being non-executive chairman of Vodafone. I am not a sponsor. They dont have the same expectation.When do you as a promoter decide that it is time that you should become a sponsor? Let us assume that this second wave of successful diversification that you did were not successful, would you still be saying all this?
So, in a way, it also gets linked to your expectations from future and living with disappointments from your past. Thats in a way what you are saying. I think the honest answer has to be that if the outcomes were not as exciting as they have been, I think, I would have not been as restful in my mind about it as I am appearing right now. I think thats possibly the case, but it also means in my current way of thinking that I would have to work harder at myself to become restful about the disappointments of the past.So, luckily for meand luck is a factor or the blessing that I havethe way I see it from nature and everything else is that these have moved reasonably in tandem. If they had not, the stretch would have been more and one would have to work harder to overcome those disappointments.Is there someone else in your fraternity who has done this really well? Is there a role model?
I wont go to the extent of saying whether I have a role model. I wont say that I am looking at somebody and say look how he did it. But I can tell you who has done it and done it very successfully. He is Vikram Lal (promoter of Eicher Motors Ltd). He is very restful and peaceful as a person. Look what has happened to Eicher. He wanted a particular life for some reason and he went after it and he has got it.I so solidly believe in impermanence that for me to be attached to a business, in this case, life insurance, it is stupid to be attached to it. When life is impermanent then what is this stigma about a business being permanent. Today, when you look at it, the power of this sector in this business is moving to banks. Whether these (insurance) companies are going to be profitable or not will not be because our premiums will get higher. We have the highest persistency (a measure of policy renewals) in the country84%. It is unheard of. The No. 2 company is 63%. So, I cant have more persistency in this business. The banks are now controlling distribution virtually. So, the only way to improve profitability is expense management. So, power shifting from agency to bankers, premiums not going up, expense management, regulators everywhere in this world are tightening the screws on the companies. Solvency margin, shareholder profits, expense allowance and disallowance, participating account versus shareholder account. No. 3 some sort of going back to expense management and market share, some sort of geographies have emerged for different companies. We are very strong in Gujarat; Gujarat is our second or third largest territory. But, more or less, we are more strong in the north and the south than we are in the west or east. HDFC (Life) is more strong in the west and the south than they are in the north. So, if you take the bank they are, you take the opportunity to consolidate and, therefore, cut some unessential costs and you take the link and fourth, product. In our time, we were heavily into protection and savings products. Even today, 80% of our business comes from protection and savings products, not from ULIPs (unit-linked insurance plans) and the like. HDFC is other way around, may be two-third or one-third.These are the four things that I saw writing on the wall about. And I have to tell you that when as a sponsor, among the 23 or 24 companies that are in life (insurance), if you take the balance sheet of the sponsor, we must be one of the smallest, I think. So from being in that position to sitting at No.3 of 23-24 with all the names you know sitting below us, you can get spoilt; and then, one fine day, because of these four factors, nobody gives you notice of failure in life like you never get notice of death.The same is in this business, some things just happen, and they change and then all of a sudden you say, oh shit what has happened?Six months ago, we were like this. And you come from 3 to 6 to 8 to 9. I dont want to take that chance; but then, it will go back to the question you asked me that if at the end of all this it was not good, would you have felt the same thing and I would have said no and I would have to start again, building again. I can see it happening, but my responsibility is I must not let it happen. Here is my opportunity that God has sent to me, I must take it.But you do take impulsive decisions? You do take decisions on the basis of your instinct?
Of course, you do.In South Africa, for instance.
Of course, I did. But hang on, yes and no. The impulsive decision that was taken about South Africa was not for business. The impulsive decision was to want to be there and enjoy the location. Like I may have a home. So, that was the impulsive decision. When it started to go away from becoming a holiday home or retreat to business, then I am very conscious, not impulsive. So, today that operation is being run exactly like any company of the Max group, with a board, people, CEOs, accountability, targets, budgets, matrix and data.Is it a part of the Max group?
No, no, private. Max has nothing to do with it.Could you elaborate a little bit, what is it about?
It is about hospitality, lifestyle, hotels, rooms, agriculture, plums, wines, almonds, wine-making, selling wines, three hotels, beer. We have a similar property in the UK. The first property is Linthwaite (Lake District Hotel, Linthwaite House), which is in the UK. So, we will grow in the UK. We have just acquired it in April. On 25 April, we took over.Whats the vision for it?
I have always wanted to be in the hospitality business. When I started vision 2000 of Max, I picked four areas: it was insurance, healthcare, education and hospitality. When we got cracking on insurance and healthcare, we did not have five rupees, or five minutes or five calories of energy to invest in anything other than insurance and healthcare; so we left it at that. In a way, Antara (homes for senior citizens) and remotely Vana (wellness resort) were born out of this idea of hospitality. And now, I am starting my life in education. Education is one of them, but it is a little too premature to talk about. In education, we have started some work. Are we engaged in it? Yes, but what are we going do, I dont know. But we have decided to be in that sector, so I dont know whether its 0 to 11 or KG to 16.Is someone thinking about this?
Yes. Very much. But just now, in August, its too soon for me to say whether its going to be Boeing or Airbus or north only or all India or only abroad... But it will be top three. I just like that expression of top three. And it should be, otherwise whats the point?Why are you interested in the real estate business?
I have a bit of khurak (itch) here. Actually, my grandfather was in the contracting business. That was my great grandfathers business in Pakistan. The bhai family were contractors. They built the road from India to Burma as a case in point. So, even now, you go to Lahore and all, and you will see a lot of buildings built by them. People in the street remember them as a family. So, I have a khurak for civil, real estate and stuff. I like land. I like construction, I like design. I like building. Every time the economy is on the cusp, and every time we talk about India being the next big thing... there are sections which are being talked about such as manufacturing, real estate, education... Do you see the economy like that?
I do and on the manufacturing side, I cant tell you anything today. I hope I can tell you in 60 days. We will, if all goes well, we will be in that space, in the prime ministers central part of his vision... Make in India. I will give you a beautiful project, if it succeeds, I dont know, I cant tell you today, we are working on it. I cant tell you what it is today. But if it succeeds, Mr. (Narendra) Modi will use this as an example of Make in India.Manufacturing is huge right? Its like a huge umbrella.
Our manufacturing space is only in one sector, which is polymers area. I am talking about that area, I am not talking about planes or furniture or phones or cars. Lets see. See, we never looked at anything else all these years. Thats why I coined this expression that I will look now at WWOBwider world of business. Education is that. Differentiated real estate is that. Investing is that. Everybody did investment. Other than financial services companies, people didnt use investing as a business. And you dont have to be financial investor to invest.

Huge growth opportunities. Healthcare, if done and executed right. But most people will not be able to get it right.

				The companys per-tonne steel realization shows an increase of just 0.5% over a year ago. What saved the quarter for Sail was a decline in its raw material costs.Sails revenue declined by 2.7% from a year ago to Rs.9,238 crore, while its operating profit improved to Rs234 crore compared with Rs89 crore. A sequential comparison is not possible due to the shift to Ind-AS accounting standards from the current quarter.Although its operating profit has improved, an increase in depreciation and finance costs, and a decline in other income has contributed to a loss of Rs535 crore versus a loss of Rs248 crore in the year-ago period.The substantial widening of its loss is what may have caused the 5.68% decline in its share on Friday.Sails share has been gaining ground in the past three months to 9 September,  and is up by 12.9% compared with a 21.4% increase in the BSE Metal Index. Although its operating margin has improved, it is not enough to cover the increase seen in depreciation and interest costs.The scenario for steel companies had improved with the imposition of anti-dumping duty and minimum import price on steel imports. The months of July and August have seen some improvement in Sails output, on a sequential basis. A gradual pick-up in sales will give investors confidence that its output can reach higher levels, justifying the investments it is making in adding to steel capacity.The outlook for domestic steel prices has improved with the government lending support and global prices rising. Domestic demand remains a worry though. In April-August, steel consumption rose by only 1.3% over a year ago, according to data from the Joint Plant Committee. However, an increase in exports and a decline in imports is supporting an increase in domestic production.Investors will be happy even if Sails output does not increase by much but is able to report a much higher jump in profits.

				Revenue and volume are up 18% from a year ago. As has been the case in recent quarters, Latin America led the growth with a 37% rise in revenue. What came as a surprise though is a strong 20% growth in the India business.A combination of dry spells, delayed crop seasons and demonetization-induced disruption to business has reduced growth expectations of  agrochemical companies. Validating that view, Rallis India Ltd recently reported a subdued 8% growth for the December quarter despite a favourable base.UPLs India business also has the benefit of a favourable baserevenue in Q3 last fiscal was down 17%. Even then, as one analyst with a domestic broking firm points out, the growth is stronger than expectations. A crop shift in favour of pulses, soyabean, oilseeds and corn resulted in improved demand for herbicides, which helped drive the top line, Sharekhan said in a note.In Latin America, the company benefited from better crop area and yield improvements in Brazil, a large market for UPL in terms of revenue. Its insecticide brands did well due to the high infestation of sucking insect in soybean. In North America, the business was flat as low incomes made farmers wary of investing in agriculture inputs. Business in Europe grew 8%. Its herbicides products did well, the company said in its results presentation.While revenue in the rest of the countries grew 2%, Latin America and India stood as major growth drivers for UPL. In a conference call with analysts, the management maintained a 12-15% revenue growth forecast and 60-100 basis points expansion in operating margin.Achieving the growth guidance may not look challenging, especially with revenue already rising 14% so far this fiscal.But the growth outlook in the current quarter is less sanguine. The major consumption phase is over in three key geographies-the US, Europe and India. Management has also cautioned for a tougher operating environment during Q4 FY17 in North America, Europe and India, Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd adds.This puts the growth burden on Latin America. Thankfully, the prospects in the region, especially Brazil, remain encouraging.Though the valuation at 16 times one-year-forward earnings estimates does not look expensive yet, two factors will play a crucial role in the continuing outperformance of the UPL stock.One is the maintenance of revenue growth momentum.

Earlier last week, its US unit Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd reported lower-than expected sales, declining sequentially by 11.6% to $234 million. Competition and its effect on drug prices are affecting sales growth. Sun Pharmas own sales growth in the US market rose 19% sequentially to $375 million.
				   
				Ex-Taro US sales growth benefited from the sales of generic Gleevec, a cancer drug, with a 180-day exclusivity that was launched on 1 February. Exclusivity has ended now and the benefits from this launch will taper, as competition leads to lower prices. Also, Sun Pharmas management said the $35 million of revenue recorded in this quarter is a one-time income.Overall, Sun Pharmas gross sales rose 22.7% over a year ago to Rs.8,007 crore, with the US markets leading growth by 31.7% mainly due to the generic Gleevec. A weaker rupee, down by 5.5% over a year ago, would have also helped growth look better. Having completed its Halol remediation, the company is waiting for the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) to inspect the plant.Supplies of products that had been affected have been restored. However, the US market continues to remain a difficult one, with most companies indicating pricing pressure affecting sales. Sun Pharmas performance in this market depends on its Halol plant getting an okay from USFDA, which will open the door to more approvals from this plant.In India, sales grew 7.5%, with the effect of price controls and bans on combination drugs affecting industry sales growth. While Suns growth in the countries it classifies as emerging markets did well, rising by 17%, in the rest of the world markets, sales declined by 2.2%. The increase in API, or active pharmaceutical ingredients, sales continued in the June quarter, too, rising 73%. A large part of this increase is being attributed to the consolidation in its opiates business in Australia.Sun Pharmas operating profit margin rose by 9 percentage points over a year ago, but sequential comparison is not being presented due to a change in accounting standards.

				Reliance AIF, a unit of Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd, launched the fund in January and is looking at investing in high-quality assets in key cities that will generate regular rental income and capital appreciation on exiting the property. The fund that will raise capital from domestic and offshore investors comes amid a prolonged slowdown Indias real estate sector, with weak residential sales and uncertainty over recovery. However, steady lease rentals, good absorption levels, inadequate supply and global investor interest have breathed life into the commercial office sector.There are no development risks attached to owning and leasing out Grade A commercial office assets. This is a large and growing asset class and there are enough opportunities. The attractiveness is that this asset class offers periodic rental income typically higher than that generated on bonds, along with significant potential for capital appreciation on exits. This is an opportune time for capturing potential upside on office assets, said Shahzad Madon, head of portfolio management services and alternative assets at Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management.The Reliance Rental Yield Fund is a 4-6 year fund that will buy or fund pre-leased, rent generating properties. It targets a rental yield of 7.5-8.25% per annum and a gross internal rate of return (IRR) of 12-16% at a fund level, including capital appreciation on exit.Reliance already has a strong pipeline of transactions and is expecting to do the first closing shortly, around the time it will also start deploying the capital, Madon said. The new fund will have the first-mover advantage, even though there is a pipeline of more office funds coming up later this year, analysts said.After the economic slowdown in 2008, developers gave up capital-intensive office projects and shifted focus to the residential market, which seemed a safe bet at the time. A number of large apartment projects came up in the next few years, resulting in a glut in the market and another slowdown in 2012-13.Madon said its a good time to invest in office properties, with valuations being reasonable and prices not having gone up.The commercial office sector is in the cusp of a recovery, he said.Though demand is in excess of supply of office space today, there is a good pipeline of projects with developers looking to build new office projects again. Not just the top few cities, but Hyderabad is back on the radar and even a market like Navi Mumbai attracts good demand for new office space, said Shashank Jain, partner, transaction services at PricewaterhouseCoopers India.If all goes well, 2017 will also mark two significant events in commercial real estate. DLF Ltds stake sale in its commercial property arm, DLF CyberCity Developers Ltd, to institutional investors, is expected to be concluded and Embassy Group and Blackstone Group Lp may go for a real estate investment trust (REIT) listing.Reliance AIF is currently also raising a Rs1,000-crore residential fund from Indian and overseas investors.

But the Nehru Hall, where he used to stay, hasnt changed much, Pichai said.Interviewed by Hitesh Oberoi, managing director and chief executive officer of Info Edge (India) Ltd, Pichai took a trip down memory lane to his years at Kgp as a student of metallurgical engineering.From the time he was a student at the institute, he always wanted to build computing products, he said, and thus wound up with Google. In his free time at IIT, he would study programming languages such as Fortran.On Indias centrality to Googles plans, Pichai said the technology giant was training some two million people to develop mobile applications.India has the potential to emerge as a powerhouse in software development, but it will take a few more years to realise that potential, he said.What India needs to become a global player in digital economy, competitive with any country in the world is cheap devicesa $30 smart phone, according to Pichai.In India, Google is working on launching its services in as many languages as possible, he said.

				One, this capital infusion will straightaway trim debt. In a conference call with reporters on Monday, GMRs management said its corporate debt would reduce from Rs.6,300 crore to Rs.4,300 crore. Note that GMRs consolidated debt, including project-specific borrowings, still stands at close to Rs.40,000 crore.Still, any dent in that pile of debt will in turn cut interest costs, bringing relief to the profit and loss account too. In the last at least eight quarters, GMR has been reporting profits at the Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) level. However, interest costs that are as much as one-third of sales meant the company was dragged into losses.The second benefit for GMR is that this investment has catapulted the valuation of its energy business to a level higher than what the Street had estimated. Tenaga has valued the energy unit at Rs.6,700 crore. This excludes some new projects in Chhattisgarh and Indonesia. Analysts had pegged the valuation much lower at three-fourths of that offered by Tenaga.This deal comes against a backdrop of some positives for GMR. The energy segments overall plant load factor and cash flows have consistently improved in the last few quarters. The airports and roads segments too have reported better operating margins throughout fiscal year 2016. The situation would only get better in these two segments as economic activity improves.Yet, retail investor interest in GMR has been low, given that it still continues to post losses. Besides, like other private sector firms in infrastructure, the company is choked with macro issues such as paucity of gas and delays in project clearances.Thats perhaps why the GMR stock rose just 0.81% on a day when the market benchmark performed far better. At around Rs.12.50 apiece, the shares trade just a tad above their one-year forward estimated book value.The remaining debt will still act as a fetter to GMRs profitability.

				That will change next year, when Apple Inc. plans to adopt the technology for the next major upgrade to its flagship product. To do so, the Cupertino, California-based company will have to get its hands on millions of OLED screens.As a result, Japanese suppliers are under pressure to build up manufacturing operations. Apple, which usually prefers to have multiple suppliers, is in negotiations with Sharp Corp. to procure OLEDs. Japan Display Inc. is moving to build up its own OLED production capabilities. Initial costs could reach $2 billion for each, stretching their finances even before they get any firm orders. Even so, they may not have a choice.If they dont invest in OLED, they will have to get out of the smartphone supplier business altogether, said Takeo Miyamoto, an analyst at MUFJ Morgan Stanley.JDI shares rose as much as 11% on Monday to their highest in almost three months. SMBC Nikko Securities raised its rating on the company to outperform from neutral.The smartphone industry is shifting away from liquid-crystal displays, or LCDs, which used to be on almost every phone and remains the standard for TVs. Now, the most expensive handsets usually feature OLEDs, thanks to their ability to use less battery power while delivering sharper and brighter images. Theyre also flexible, which opens up the possibility of bendable phones and other innovations in the sector.Samsung Electronics Co. currently dominates the market for smartphone OLEDs, making up 99% of shipments in the first half, according to IHS Markit. EverDisplay Optronics Ltd has just 0.4%. But Samsung isnt just the only supplier for the screens, its also Apples biggest competitor in the smartphone market, making it even more critical for Apple to secure new providers if it wants to use OLEDs for iPhones.Apple has lagged behind its rivals in embracing OLEDs. Samsungs Galaxy S7 and Googles new Pixel phones feature OLED screens, and dozens of models from Motorola, Oppo, HTC and other manufacturers also use the displays. A representative from Apple didnt respond to a request for comment on its OLED plans.Apple is said to be in talks with Samsung to secure OLED displays. Sharps capital investment in OLED is part of 200 billion yen that the manufacturer had already committed to OLED technology, part of a strategic plan it adopted with new owner Foxconn Technology Group, itself a key contract manufacturer for Apple. The opportunity is huge: IHS Markit estimates that the OLED-smartphone display market will be worth $18.6 billion in 2018, surpassing LCDs.Most suppliers are planning aggressive capital investment, said Hiroshi Hayase, an analyst at IHS Markit. Because OLEDs can be made of film-like flexible materials, theres a chance to open up new markets, he said.For Japan Display, which has lost 80% of its value since listing in 2014, winning the Apple contract is both its biggest opportunity and risk. JDI already depends on Apple for 54% of its revenue from LCD screens, according to Bloombergs Supply Chain Analysis. The display maker has approached banks to secure tens of billions of yen in financing, according to Kyodo News, and has little choice but to invest in OLED to remain in the game.JDI will have to invest 150 billion yen ($1.44 billion) to set up its OLED manufacturing line, either through borrowing or equity financing. JDI is planning to start an OLED fabrication line for testing by March 2018, according Kazuhiko Kubota, a spokesman for Tokyo-based JDI. He said the company is talking to customers, shareholders and banks about obtaining funding, but declined to discuss the companys planned investment in OLED or specific fundraising activities.One option for JDI would be to enter into a vendor financing agreement, using funds from Apple to build up operations and paying it back through sales of OLED screens. Its a risky strategy, and one that backfired for GT Advanced Technologies Inc. in 2014. Apple lined up $578 million in prepayment loans for GT Advanced so that it could feature tough sapphire screens for the iPhone 6. The manufacturer failed to deliver material of acceptable quality, and GT Advanced later sought bankruptcy protection.JDIs strategy has been to depend on Apple, Miyamoto said. Thats naïve.Formed four years ago from the struggling LCD operations of Sony Corp., Toshiba Corp. and Hitachi Ltd, JDI is 36 owned by Innovation Network Corp. of Japan, a government entity created in 2009 to support key technology businesses. Japan Display went public in 2014, and after posting a profit that year, has been losing money. While revenue has climbed each year, its now projected to decline 9% in the current fiscal year through June.The company is at risk of running short of funds, Miyamoto said. Its on a tightrope. Bloomberg",2016-10-17,Gjfr4wfuVEMAS1rWM4v5GJ,"Apple plans to adopt the OLED technology for the next major upgrade to its flagship product.

A recovery in its petrochemicals business is on the cards. Overall, fiscal year 2016 was a challenging one. Stand-alone pre-tax and one-time earnings declined by a fourth from a year earlier to Rs.3,173 crore. The petrochemicals business has been a major source of pain what with the segment posting earnings before interest and taxes (Ebit) loss of Rs.807 crore in FY16. Performance was impacted on account of lower sales volume and weaker prices.However, the business is expected to swing to profit this year. The re-negotiation of RasGas long-term LNG (liquefied natural gas) contract at lower prices is expected to reduce raw material costs, helping petrochemicals performance. GAIL has commissioned its petrochemical plant expansion in Pata (Uttar Pradesh) with capacity of 0.4 million tonnes per annum or MMPTA (taking total capacity to 0.81 MMPTA). Accordingly, the segment should also benefit from a gradual ramp up in volume. Further, if crude oil prices continue to rise, an improvement in petrochemicals prices can be expected.Also Read: Mahanagar Gas IPO gets subscribed 64.51 times

				Lu, an architect of chief executive officer (CEO) Satya Nadellas strategy for artificial intelligence and bots at Microsoft, will take up his new post with immediate effect, Baidu said in an e-mailed statement on Tuesday. Every Baidu business unit head will report to Lu, a respected technologist who ran the Office and search groups during his tenure at Microsoft.Lu now shoulders responsibility for steering Baidu toward its next phase of growth. Chinas largest search engine and its billionaire founder, Robin Li, is seeking to refocus on enhancing search with AI and other technologies, as rivals such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. muscle in on its internet-advertising business. Any time you have stronger depth in the management team, that has to be a good thing, said Kirk Boodry, an analyst at New Street Research. Maybe this allows Robin to take more of a chairman role and focus more on the technology, focus more on the strategy for the company going forward.Lus tenure at Microsoft overlapped with that of Steve Ballmer, whose stewardship of the company has been criticized for missing some of the biggest trends in technology, including social media and mobile. Its Bing search engine, which Lu helped develop, never managed to make much headway against Googles. The executive departed the US software company last year for health reasons.Baidu itself is coming off a turbulent year, when a scandal involving online medical ads prompted tighter government restrictions that constricted its ad business, while an attempt to sell off video-streaming unit iQiyi to a consortium led by Li collapsed after investor protests.Li has now flagged AI as the next key profit driver for the business. Lu, who holds more than 40 US patents, joins as Baidu focuses on research into advanced technologies such as AI and autonomous cars. The company considers AI development fundamental to its future, but it could be looking at a very long-term horizon.To achieve our goals, especially in artificial intelligence, which is a key strategic focus for the next decade, we will need to continue attracting the best global talent, Li said in Tuesdays statement. With Dr. Lu on board, we are confident that our strategy will be executed smoothly and Baidu will become a world-class technology company and global leader in AI.By working with speaker-maker Harman International Industries Inc., Baidu wants to create a smart device that, like Amazons Echo, can understand spoken commands and order food or summon cars. The Chinese search giant is also trying to exert its own influence on the rapidly deepening field. It released its PaddlePaddle software on GitHub, letting AI enthusiasts freely make use of the development tools.

-0.57,"Investors in Aditya Birla Nuvo Ltd had been hounding it with one questionwhen will the financial services business be demerged and listed as a separate entity? The company would typically dismiss this, saying some of these businesses were still small and needed the backing of a large firm such as Nuvo. 
				   
				The company has now decided to demerge the financial services business and list it. But instead of ending up with a leaner corporate structure, the Aditya Birla Group has made things far more complicated, by merging Nuvo with Grasim Industries Ltd. Besides, the complicated restructuring will increase the promoter groups stake in the cash cow cement business and decrease its ownership of the cash guzzling telecom business.Before the demerger, Nuvo will be merged into Grasim, which means investors of both companies will be saddled with a myriad of new businesses they earlier did not have any exposure to. The groups chairman, Kumar Mangalam Birla, said in a press conference that the merger, along with the demerger, will create value for shareholders. But on the contrary, with an increasing number of businesses ending up under one holding company, value could get destroyed. The only silver lining for existing shareholders is a holding in the to-be-listed financial services firm. The new behemoth that arises out of the merger will have so many diverse interests, most investors are likely to shun it. After all, each of the interesting parts of these businesses will be separately listedUltraTech Cement Ltd for the cement business, Idea Cellular Ltd for the telecom business and finally the newly listed financial services business. Investors may steer clear of a firm where a holding company discount is applied to so many large businesses.For perspective, Grasims 60.25% stake in UltraTech Cement itself is valued at less than 70% of its market value because of the holding company discount. Until now, for Grasim shareholders, there was at least an arbitrage opportunity, which would come into play when share prices fell vis-à-vis UltraTech Cements share price. In Nuvos case, some investors found the play on the financial services story compelling. There are hardly any reasons to invest in the merged company, certainly not after the financial services firm lists. Interestingly enough, the promoter holding in Grasim will rise from 31.3% to around 38.8% post the restructuring. Their ownership in the financial services and telecom businesses will decline. Minority shareholders of Grasim, on the other hand, have to settle for a lower stake in the cement business and take on exposure to the telecom and financial services business. Since the promoter group is considered the most informed investor, a natural question these investors will have is, Why should we do the opposite of what the promoters are doing? Nuvos shareholders, a far smaller piece in the whole puzzle in terms of their value of shareholding, get to enjoy the same ride as the promoters. But again, they too end up with an investment in a holding company. All told, it is not clear that the merger will add value, and minority investors may well protest.",2016-08-11,GqVgitnAuvR4RQQirAUeGO,"Instead of ending up with a leaner corporate structure, the Aditya Birla Group has made things far more complicated, by merging Nuvo with Grasim Industries

-1.0,"Shares of JSW Energy Ltd surged 13.49% on BSE on Wednesday on reports that the company is shortlisted to supply electricity to a Karnataka utility through a power purchase agreement (PPA). In a filing to BSE, the firm clarified that the bid requires several approvals for it to be finally clinched.
				   
				The caution did little to quell investor optimism. Why? JSW Energy has one of the highest shares of short-term (less than a year) electricity sales among the listed power utilities. Last fiscal year, 47% of its sales came from short-term contracts. The PPA, if it fructifies, will cut this share.The bid involves the 860 megawatts Vijayanagar power plant in Karnataka, which right now is operating on short-term power contracts. Thanks to the plants location advantagesituated in high power deficit southern IndiaJSW Energy had managed to get sufficient buyers, and that too at a good price, till now.But as transmission congestion in the region eased and stranded gas capacities came back on stream, short-term or merchant power prices began to fall. This impacted JSW Energys realizations, which fell 8% in 2014-15 and 3% in the last fiscal year. With merchant power rates remaining depressed and the Union government encouraging state utilities to purchase short-term electricity contracts through competitive bidding or reverse auction system, the firms realizations are expected to remain under pressure. The concerns have made analysts cautious, with some even paring their earnings estimates for the current and next fiscal years.So the report about JSW Energy getting shortlisted for a PPA came as a big relief. Even better is the bid price that is doing the rounds. As speculated if the company signs the deal at a tariff of about Rs.4 per unit, then the project will earn very good returns (return on equity estimated at around 20%). Also, if clinched, the PPA will ease concerns about earnings stability, which in turn can aid JSW Energys inorganic growth strategy.But all is not a given. One is the tariff. Second is the duration of the contract. Third, how are fuel costs going to be treatedwill they have a pass-through clause? The Vijayanagar power plant operates on imported coal. So while prospects look encouraging, the economic value of the contract will depend a lot on the fine print.

0.23,"The biggest winner in Ubers decision to sell its Chinese business to Didi Chuxing, its fierce local rival, appears to be Didi Chuxing. Didi not only eliminated its top competitor but gained a veritable monopoly over the worlds biggest market for ride-sharing services. The only remaining question is whether the Chinese government is willing to grant it such dominance.
				   
				And Didi has little to fear on that count. The ride-sharing industry has presented Chinas government with a host of challengesincluding serious political and social strifeand the plight of consumers hurt by reduced competition simply isnt high on its list of concerns. In Chinas biggest cities, choked by traffic and taxi monopolies, the arrival of ride-sharing has been transformative. Take Beijing: Between 1994 and 2011, the citys population increased from 11 million to 20 million, yet licensed taxis increased by only 10%, to 66,000. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Beijings cab drivers have acquired a reputation as some of the worst in the world. Taxi-hailing and ride-sharing apps offered a cheap and clever solution to this problem, and quality of life improved as a result.But that improvement came at a cost. Recorded taxi strikes in China surged from 62 in 2011 to 263 in 2015. In Shenzhen, where licenced cabbies claim that ride-sharing has cut their monthly pay in half, a strike in January effectively immobilized the city. Thousands of drivers in at least a dozen other cities walked out the same month. Making matters worse, the labour strife is compounded by class divisions: Most ride-sharing drivers own their cars, while taxi drivers must rent theirs.All this has placed the authorities in a delicate position. As in other countries, taxi companies in China are usually protected monopolies, and often owned by a local government or local officials. In most cases, they make money by charging rental fees to drivers. Didi and Uber were undercutting this comfortable arrangement by subsidizing faresthus luring both drivers and customersin a fierce war for market share.Some local governments cracked down on the newcomers, occasionally sparking riots. Others threw their support behind apps that hired drivers licenced by the old monopolies. But for the central government, the preferred approach was simpler: Eliminate competition. Doing so would limit the subsidy wars, mollify angry taxi drivers andcriticallyincrease the governments leverage over the remaining player(s).Also Read: Ubers surrender to Didi Chuxing shows humbling of US tech giants in China

Last year, regulators allowed Didi to merge with its largest domestic rival, Kuaidi, despite concerns about how the deal would affect consumers. Last week, they issued rules that effectively outlawed competition by prohibiting ride-sharing companies from setting prices below cost to push out competitors or dominate the market. That means local governments can now negotiate pricing and other concerns with Didi without having to worry about anyone undercutting the deal.Thats clearly a win for Didi. Its probably a win for Uber, whose investors will retain a 20% stake in its former rival. And (for now) it seems like a win for Beijing, which badly wants the benefits of ride-sharing without the disruptions that go along with it. The only losers will be consumers, who will likely be facing higher fares, less choice and worse service. Chinas passengers, in other words, are once again being taken for a ride.

Ltd (ONGC), said a person aware of the development. 
				   
				The move is set to secure more time for RIL to resolve the dispute and help it avoid any immediate financial impact. The ministry raised the demand on 4 November, giving RIL one month to pay up, after the justice A.P. Shah panel told the ministry on 31 August that RIL should make up for the unfair enrichment it had obtained by way of retaining the gains of gas that seeped into its field from that of ONGC. The one-member panel, which looked into ONGCs complaints of gas flow between the two companies blocks, had also said that it is the government, not the state-run firm, which is eligible for compensation from RIL.The Mukesh Ambani-promoted firm has questioned the way the government interpreted the production lease for its KG-DWN-98/3 (KG D6) block and alleged that the manner of claiming compensation neither conformed to law nor to global practices, the person cited earlier said, on condition of anonymity. RIL, as the operator of the KG D6 block, has sought arbitration on behalf of the consortium comprising Canadas Niko Resources Ltd and BP Exploration (Alpha) Ltd, the person said. Emails sent to the three companies remained unanswered at the time of going to press. A government official privy to the developments, however, said there was no way of resolving the dispute other than RIL paying for the gas that did not belong to its field. With both sides hardening their positions, the dispute is set to slip into a protracted legal battle. According to a report by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, a US-based consultancy selected by both ONGC and RIL which was relied upon by the Shah panel for confirmation of the gas flow between the blocks, about 11 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas migrated to KG D6 from adjacent fields between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2015,  of which 8.9 bcm was tapped by RIL. The government official cited above said the ministry has not applied any discretion in arriving at the compensation figure.The government merely multiplied the amount of gas found by independent consultants to have flowed between the fields with the applicable gas price, the official said. Prolonged disputes are not in the interest of the industrys development.

-0.17,"Over a decade ago, one of the doyens of Indian business journalism had written an article, Tale of two companies, comparing two packaged consumer goods makersHindustan Lever Ltd (still not Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) then) and ITC Ltd. Since then much soap and detergent have been washed down the Hooghly and Arabian Seaas indeed millions of puffs have been blown through human chimneys. While HUL has regained its old act by re-engineering itself, ITC has got its new act together by reinventing itself. 
				   
				Till the early 1990s, the punch line of all Hindustan Lever chairmen used to be we are an Indian company whose largest shareholder happens to be a multinational. ITC, on the other hand, used to be less apologetic about its BAT Plc. parentage. Following the eminently forgettable K.L. Chugh era, when Y.C. Deveshwar mounted the saddle, in a corporate coup of sorts with the backing of institutional shareholders, he decisively cut off the umbilical chord and embarked on a mission to establish ITCs Indian credentials with a vengeance. At the same time, with liberalization of the Indian economy, the new generation chairmen of Lever over time shed their trademark khadi silk bush-shirts in favour of bespoke suits when traversing the power corridors of Delhi. However, this piece is not about comparing the two companies but trace the evolution of ITC as an Indian consumer products giant. It is easy to surmise why Ajit Haksarthe last of the corporate Mohicansventured into hotels. It was partly to hedge against the possibility of curbs on the tobacco business and also as a safe haven for the surplus funds of the mother business that could be easily encashed anytime by selling the brand or the real estate. It is to Haksar and ITCs credit that they nurtured Welcomgroup for a long time before it became truly profitable. Printing and packaging (where Deveshwar first cut his teeth) and paper boards were but logical vertical integration.Similarly, one would believe the lifestyle and apparel business was started to secure the Wills franchise. But the real serious diversification was kicked off with ITCs plunge into the foods businesswhich arose both out of necessity and opportunity. Subsequently, it naturally extended to pure consumer products play.The story of ITCs transformation is one of turning a proverbial threat into an opportunity. As the time-worn cliché goescigarettes is a dying industry in more senses than one. With the intervention of World Health Organization and a judiciary increasingly sensitive to the hazards of tobacco consumption, the tobacco industry has had to brace itself for a premature sunset like its consumers (smokers). Simultaneously, there was a need to divert public attention from corporate governance and health (tobacco) to being a socially-responsible organization. This, one would suspect, was the genesis of a we also make cigarettes strategy.The ban on cigarette advertising came as a blessing in disguise as it left ITC flush with cash. Not having a majority foreign shareholding allowed it to enter the food sectorthen reserved for domestic players (except those such as Nestle SA, GlaxoSmithKline PLC and a few otherswho enjoyed the benefits of a grandfather clause). Food was largely an open field with no organized pan-India player barring Britannia Industries Ltd. From biscuits, atta, ready-to-cook or heat meals, it has seamlessly moved to instant noodles, juices and now, one hears, coffee is in the pipeline.For a cigarette manufacturer with low technology and little product innovation except in packaging perhaps, ITCs most remarkable achievement was in learning the ropes of an entirely different supply chain and gaining mastery of a new product category, not just in terms of marketing but product development and innovation. Equally challenging was building a network whichcontrary to popular beliefhad little in common with the cigarette retail channel.The evolution into personal care was even more interesting because here it had to contend with a giant like Unilever with an 80-year legacy in India, international brands and world-class research and development. Making soaps, body-wash and shampoo brands is as different as paneer is from talcum powder. Globally, too, it is rare for companies to be equally successful in both food and packaged consumer products. Neither Unilever nor Procter & Gamble Co. can really be considered to have handled both businesses with the same level of success while traditional food makers like Nestle and General Foods Corp. have by and large stuck to their knitting.However, ITCs real success lies in achieving this transformation with existing, home-grown talent with very little (or practically no) lateral hires at senior levels. ITC remains one of the few large companies that still believes in providing long-term careers to its employees. It is a key differentiator in a fast-changing corporate world where turnover and velocity are the current flavours of human resources management. Changing the corporate DNA and culture is no mean task. If an organization has to reinvent itself so have to its leaders. This is where Deveshwar scores above many of our present day corporate icons. Arguably, he had an extended stay at the top. But Deveshwar leaves behind a new ITC for the next generation.In contrast, the much-hyped Project Millennium of Leverriding on which many careers were madelost steam. Among close to a dozen business ideas incubatedjust about one (water, that too in a modified form) has survived the genetic implant.It was generous of Deveshwar to praise Amul and Patanjali in his speech. The jury on the latter is still out. But, what it does underscore is the rapidly shrinking ramp-up time. What took Unilever 60 years to achieve, Amul did in 40 and ITC in 20. Now, Patanjali has managed to scale up in less than five. A fascinating battle lies ahead between the global giants and the emerging swadeshi challengers.Sandip Ghose is a marketer, blogger and writer.

-0.21,"New York: Four of the best professional poker players in the world spent most of January holed up at the Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh, losing. Theyd show up before 11 am, wearing sweatpants and stylish sneakers, and sit down in front of computer screens. Each of them was supposed to play 1,500 hands of heads-up no limit Texas Hold Em online before they could go back to the hotel for the night. This often meant working past 10 pm. Over the course of the day, Starbucks cups and water bottles piled up next to the playerss keyboards. Chipotle bags lay at their feet. 
				   
				Every time one of the players made a move, the action was transmitted to a computer server sitting eight kilometers away at Carnegie Mellon University. From there, a signal would travel another 19 kms to their opponent, a piece of software called Libratus running at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center in Monroeville, a nearby suburb. Libratus played eight hands at oncetwo against each opponent. It moved at a deliberate pace, slow enough to drive Jason Les, one of its human opponents, a bit mad. It makes the days longer, said Les, an earnest, athletic-looking man who seemed eager to take a few minutes off one afternoon last week. Waiting should not affect me whatsoever, but sometimes youre just like, OK, is this going to be over yet? Libratus, of course, never needs a break. Its different from human players in other ways, too. People tend to think longer when theres more money at stake. The computer plays most slowly on small pots, a result of having to scroll through all the additional possibilities that come from having more chips remaining in its hand. Libratus also tends to make huge, sudden wagers, violating standard betting conventions by throwing its money into the pot in irregular amounts and at odd intervals.Coming from a human player, behaviour like this would be irritating, reckless and, over the long run, expensive. But Libratuss main attribute as a poker player is that its inhumanly good. When the 20-day tournament at Rivers came to an end Monday, the humans had lost $1.8 million. (They didnt actually have to pony up the cash; money serves as the way of keeping score in poker.) Tuomas Sandholm and Noam Brown, the computer scientists at Carnegie Mellon who built Libratus, celebrated the win as the first time that a computer has beaten top poker players at a variant of unlimited Texas holdem, the worlds most prominent poker game. Experts in artificial intelligence have always used games as a way to develop and test their creations. Computers have surpassed the best human players at chess, checkers, backgammon, and go. Poker is a distinct challenge because of the element of chance, and because the players dont know what cards their opponents are holding. So-called imperfect information games require the sort of human intelligencelike deceiving an opponent and sensing when shes deceiving you that computers lack.No limit holdem is the game you see in tournaments, and it has the reputation of being more of an art than a science, said Adam Kucharski, author of The Perfect Bet: How Science and Math Are Taking the Luck Out of Gambling. There was the idea that this game would be safer for much longer from these machines. That idea has been blown up in recent weeks. In early January, researchers at the University of Alberta released a paper based on a contest in which their own AI, named DeepStack, beat 11 professional poker players.Whether DeepStack beat Libratus to the punch is a matter of debate. Sandholm said that the pros who played against his bot were better than those DeepStack defeated. Michael Bowling, the head of the University of Albertas computer program, conceded this point. But he questioned whether humans are at their best when playing continuously for nearly a month. Both men agree that poker AI has just crossed a significant threshold. For them this has little to do with poker itself. Holdem is just a way to find sparring partners for their artificial intelligence programs, and the gains made by game-playing bots will filter back into applications like cybersecurity. This is the main benchmark the community has settled on, but these algorithms are not for poker, said Sandholm, who was once one of the worlds top-ranked windsurfers and kind of looks like Bill Gates. Theyre general purpose.ALSO READ | Work in an automated futureDeepStack and Libratus play an unusual version of poker. The computers are matched up against a single opponent, as opposed to a group of players. The number of chips each player holds is reset after every hand, eliminating the complicated psychological game through which players with more chips intimidate poorer players by forcing them to make big bets. Eric Hollreiser, a spokesman for Amaya Inc., the worlds largest online poker company, said this limits any threat that AI poses to the poker industry. While on a functional hand-by-hand basis it mimics poker play, it is far, far removed from the reality of what happens at tables, he said. There are other experiments going on in less controlled environments. Poker bots have been playing in online cash games for nearly as long as scientists have been building them in labs. Theyve historically played low-stakes games and havent been considered very skillful. But bots are spreading into higher-stakes contests, said Chris Grove, a gambling industry analyst and the publisher of Online Poker Report. If youre an online poker operator, this is probably your number one fraud concern, and probably by a pretty wide margin, he said. The poker industry and the academic poker world have been quietly collaborating for years. Everyone involved remains sketchy on the details. But both the people building commercial bots and those trying to combat them watch the academic work closely. Several of Bowlings former students have gone on to work for online poker companies. At least one has sold bots used to play online. ALSO READ | Five technology trends to watch out for in 2017Of course a lot of gambling people are worried that it may kill internet gambling for money, because people are worried that bots are going to be so good that theyre going to be had, said Sandholm. That could happen, but thats not really my concern. In poker slang, a computer program that can do your playing for you is called a dream machine. Participants in online forums swap notes about when suspicious activity might indicate robotic play  or war stories about how theyve made their own bots. Amaya, which operates online poker operations PokerStars and Full Tilt, employs 70 people to combat this kind of fraud. PokerStars employees call players and ask them to describe their strategies on certain hands. The company has also sent e-mails to players requiring them to make videos in which users rotate the camera 360 degrees to show their surroundings, then play for over an hour with their hands and keyboards fully visible. Bots dont have to be wildly skilled at poker to be profitable for their operatorsand dangerous to the industry. A program that can make modest profits by exploiting mediocre players may be worth it. But Darse Billings, the head of poker strategy at Gamesys, the UK-based online gaming company, said dream machines and academic AIs are using different techniques and trying to solve fundamentally different challenges. Beating bad players isnt just a simplified version of beating elite players. Its a completely separate problem. More than anyone, Billings understands both poker worlds. He studied the game while getting a masters degree in computer science in the 1990s, then became a professional poker player to pay off his student loans. Several years later he went back to school to work with Jonathan Schaeffer, a computer scientist at the University of Alberta best known for writing software that could play checkers perfectly. Billings convinced Schaeffer to focus on poker next. To solve checkers, Schaeffer had used a method that essentially attempted to calculate the best move in any relevant situation, without considering what had happened up to that point. But it didnt make sense to think about each move as an isolated problem in a game like poker, where luck is involved and not everyone has access to all the relevant information. The University of Alberta researchers set out to develop an overall strategy. This entailed looking for what is known in game theory as a Nash equilibriuman approach for playing a two-person game that cannot lose over the long run regardless of what ones opponent does to respond. ALSO READ | How bots will shape the future of workA Nash equilibrium isnt a single ideal style of play. The key to an equilibrium strategy in poker is to play the strongest potential hands while remaining unpredictable. When you bet your strong hands, there needs to be some doubt, said Billings. The team developed a cautious AI, dubbed Mr. Pink, and a very aggressive one, named Agent Orange. Its hard to talk about a computer program that does this without sounding like youre talking about something that to actual thinks. The equilibrium approach drew the University of Albertas Bowling, whose specialty is game theory, to poker in 2003. Sandholm, who sat on Bowlings thesis committee at Carnegie Mellon, turned to poker the following year, and has taken on a similar approach. Sandholm and Bowling started the Annual Computer Poker Competition together in 2006, and have periodically played against top human players. Even as they compete, the labs have been gleaning insights from one anothers research ever since.Both programs took big steps toward the endgame in the last several years. In January 2015, Bowlings team published a paper showing how it had solved heads-up limit holdem, a two-person poker game that is simpler than no-limit holdem because of restrictions on how players can bet. Sandholm and Brown, a Ph.D. student who has been working with him on poker AI for the last five years, held their first Brains v. AI competition against top humans at Rivers Casino several months later. Their bot, named Claudico, lost $732,000 over 80,000 hands played against four professional players. Sandholm said the match was close enough to call a draw, a claim that at least one player disputed. Sandholm and Brown say there are several general areas their AI has improved since then. Claudico played well in the early stages, but tended to make mistakes at the end of hands. It bluffed at the wrong moments, and had trouble accounting for how the odds of the game changed based on the cards that it knew had been removed from the deck. In its simplest form, this is the reasoning that says that if there are two kings on the table and you have two kings, your opponent cant have any. Libratus has improved in all those areas. Its creators remain coy on some other areas, like specifically how it chooses to make adjustments based on what it learns over the course of a day of play.All the details of Libratus will eventually be revealed when its creators publish their findings. This kind of academic work tends to filter into real-world poker in various ways. The Annual Computer Poker Competitions have included entrants that also play in cash games, according to Brown. Bowling said his research papers are popular on message boards for people building bots. Theres this whole separate group of people reading these papers and trying to understand them, he said.Billings joined the poker industry in 2008. Hes one of a handful of people who did so after leaving the University of Albertas program. Most of them have been hired by companies that run gaming platforms. Richard Gibson struck out on his own, starting a company called Robot Shark Gaming that built AI programs for studying and playing strategic games, and then a fantasy sports company called SportsBid. Gibson was finishing up a Ph.D. in 2013 when a group of professional players approached him, offering to pay for software they could use in training. Gibson was only given one persons name, never met any of his clients in person, and isnt sure how many people were in the group. Even though they werent using it to gamble online, there was a stigma, he said.Gibson built multiple programs, and said he designed the software to demonstrate the effectiveness of various strategies; it couldnt play on its own. In his most lucrative year, Gibson made about $100,000 on that project, and his clients paid another $20,000 to $30,000 in fees related to the computing power it took to run the software. The anonymous pros werent Gibsons only clients. In one case, he said someone paid him tens of thousands of dollars to spend about six months building a lightweight poker bot. He didnt ask much about how it would be usedhe didnt want to knowbut the design pointed to a specific application. My clients wanted a standalone thing they could load onto their laptop, he said. I imagine theyre trying to play online with them. At the end of each night at Rivers, Les and his fellow poker pros would order takeout and pore over data about the days action in search of Libratuss weaknesses. Early in the month, they woke up each morning optimistic that they had some new tricks. There were specific exploits we identified in the first few days, said Les. We attacked them and attacked them, and now theyre gone. Libratus was also making adjustments. During the day, the program split its computing power between playing the hands in front of it and what Sandholm described as continuous strategy improvement. At night, the program focused entirely on strategy, using 600 nodes of the supercomputer, the equivalent of about 3,330 high-end Macbooks working in tandem. In poker, as in other games that AI has played at the top levels, computers have developed strategies that filter back to human players. Les said hes trying to figure out how to adapt some of Libratuss irregular betting behaviour to his own game. Its hard. We just simply do not have the mental capacity to do it, he said. If humans have reached the point at which their computer opponents are just too good for them, labs like the ones that Sandholm and Bowling run are facing almost the opposite problem. Head-to-head matches against professionals are one thing. But theres no clear path to turn Libratus and DeepStack into players that could be confident of beating a group of flawed humans. Thats because the equilibrium strategy that the AIs use fall apart in multiplayer games, when the point isnt to play perfectly but to identify and exploit the shortcomings in other peoples games. Several years ago Bowling did an experiment where three bots played against one another. Two of them used his labss closest approximation to perfect play; the third one was programmed to raise recklessly. At the end of the game, the dumbest bot lost a small amount of money. One of the perfect players won big, but the other one lost its shirt. Thats really the hard part. How do you reason about these games if you know youre going to sit down with human players or other programs that arent very good? said Bowling. Youre going to have to be prepared for that.  Bloomberg",2017-01-31,HeRzMG8UNSc8zRMAgds00K,Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence research raise questions about the threat that bots pose to the online gambling industry,competitor,18:36,"A computer just beat poker professionals, achieving a major AI milestone"
-0.25,"Frankfurt: For any management-minded British engineer, theres no bigger job than becoming chief executive of Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc. Warren East, a well-regarded technology enthusiast, may end up crushed by the size of the task.
				   
				East, 55, spent more than a decade transforming UK chip designer ARM Holdings into a world-beater. ARM was bought this year by Japans SoftBank for a staggering £24 billion ($29.4 billion), suggesting he did a good job.Few would have begrudged him spending the rest of his professional life holding cushy non-executive roles, giving speeches and playing his beloved church organ on weekends. But at Rolls-Royce hes opted for arguably the toughest job in British industry. After a difficult first 18 months, theres little relief in sight in 2017 for the jet engine and turbine maker.True, a rebound in oil prices may help Rolls-Royces struggling marine division. Even so, the group probably wont generate much cash flow next year, after an expected outflow of as much as £300 million in 2016.While analysts anticipate net income will rise to more than £600 million in 2017, that overstates Rolls-Royces health because of its odd accountingof which more anon.To his credit, Easts lost no time slashing costs and cutting jobs and has scored some successes: increasing financial disclosure, speeding up aircraft engine production and dispensing with Rolls-Royces imperious management culture. But the long development cycles in aerospace mean East isnt entirely the master of his destiny. The Rolls-Royce course was set long before he arrived.The companys £70.5 billion civil order book is focused on the wide-body jet market, where Rolls-Royce is aiming for a 50% share. Yet thats a questionable ambition in itself because single-aisle jets are able to fly much further these days and theyve sold much better than their fatter brethren.More important, theres no guarantee that Rolls-Royces orders, which mostly pre-date East, will ultimately generate lots of cash and profits. One reason for the recent profit woes is that older jets were grounded sooner than managers calculated, meaning Rolls-Royce didnt get the expected service revenues. In view of the huge cost of delivering (and then maintaining) such a large order book its reasonable to ask whether theres anything else previous management got wrong.There are other grounds for caution. Last month, East shocked investors when he revealed Rolls-Royces core civil aerospace unit is loss-making under the more orthodox revenue recognition practices it will have to adopt from 2018.Deutsche Bank analyst Ben Fidler thinks the civil engine division, which contributes about half of Rolls-Royce revenue, wont make an operating profit until 2019 under the new accounting rules. That will be four years after East first took over.Furthermore, when the company stops capitalizing engine losses on its balance sheet in 2018, as its done up until now, shareholder equity could be almost wiped out, according to Credit Suisse. Despite those chastening views, Rolls-Royce still trades on 25 times estimated earnings, a hefty premium to French rival Safran SAand thats before you adjust for Rolls-Royces accounting peculiarities.Such a rich valuation shows investors faith that East knows what hes doing. But that confidence could evaporate quickly if he cant provide tangible proof that Rolls-Royces order book is creating value.A crucial test will come in 2018, when the company has implied it will target about £500 million of free cash flow. Thats going to be tough. East said last month that Rolls-Royce loses up to £2 million on each new engine produced. He may come to regret not spending more time trying to perfect his organ pedal technique.

				A significant portion of the credit for making space cool again goes to the disruption of the space industry over the last few years by private enterprise. The poster boy of this bright new space is, of course, Elon Musk and SpaceX. From slashing the cost of launches by landing the first stages of rockets through putting together plans to colonize Mars, he has already shown he has what it takes to define space for tomorrow. Over the years, national space agencies like Nasa, Isro, Roscosmos, CNSA, Jaxa and ESA have been at the forefront of pushing humanity into space. That is changing.There are parallels to where space is now and where the Internet was a few decades back. For many years, the Internet remained a project inside the US government establishment. I dont need to expand on how the opening up of the Internet to entrepreneurs changed the world. Space is at a similar juncture where private enterprise is starting to make its presence felt. The next decade is when much of this shift will be under way. The attraction of space tourism has been central to the coverage and narrative that has followed private enterprise in the field. That is only natural, given the presence of media-friendly figures like Virgin Groups Richard Branson working on space tourism projects. But the real innovation driven by private enterprise is going to be in other, less glamorous but equally fascinating areas. Think small satellites, for instance. As The Economist points out, advancements in smartphones and other consumer electronics provide a wealth of ready-made technologies that can enable a CubeSat (a type of nano satellite) to perform many of the functions of a satellite a hundred times heavier and much larger, but at substantially less cost. That will revolutionize everything from weather prediction to remote sensing to telecommunications, and help bring the power of technology to billions around the world in a much deeper and more meaningful way.Then there is the opportunity to develop technology that will satiate human appetite for everything from energy to precious metals. Globally, companies like Deep Space Industries have been talking up asteroid mining. An article in the technology publication New Atlas says, Studies indicate that an asteroid 1,000 metres (3,280 ft) across could yield about 100,000 tonnes of platinumwhich already has miners in South Africa worried because we only mine a measly 130 tonnes of the metal on Earth each year.Helium 3 is another resource which can change how mankind powers itself. The Moon has rich deposits of the isotope, which is hard to find on Earth. If technology is developed to use this isotope for nuclear fusion, the amount of Helium 3 on the Moonaccording to Prof. Ouyang Ziyuan, the chief scientist of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program (Clep)can solve humanitys energy demand for around 10,000 years at least. If finding ways to make that happen isnt a challenge that entrepreneurs must rise up to, what is?While the idea of space-based business evolves, India is in the middle of a revolution as well. A new generation of entrepreneurs is backing itself to change the way we live and do business. Our opportunity in space business does not start and end with cost arbitrage for foreign companies. Our obvious cost advantages must be leveraged as a catalyst to innovate in everything from designing, developing and launching smaller satellites to making bets that can make the difference in mankinds quest for newer energy sources. We at TeamIndus are happy to start the conversation, and we hope many more Indian entrepreneurs will join us on this journey.Rahul Narayan is co-founder and fleet commander of Team Indus, an aerospace research start-up, and the only Indian team competing for the $30-million Google Lunar XPRIZEThis is part of a series of articles in Mints 10th anniversary special issue that look at India 10 years from now.

He rates the Narendra Modi government an 8 on 10 on reforms delivery. Edited excerpts:
How do you perceive the governments demonetization move?It is a dramatic and remarkable move. Normally, such a measure will happen in a country in the middle of a macroeconomic crisis and facing a hyperinflationary problem. But India is not facing such a crisis.Do you think this is the first in a series of moves to tackle the larger problem of black money?I would like to see this as part and parcel of the move to accelerate digital banking. That is the key structural thing. You had the drive to get everybody a bank account. The UIDAI programme has also has been continued. There is also the political angle of state elections next year.What are the negative implications?I think it is going to impact the economy in the next six months. But I am hoping it is short and sharp. The biggest negative is for the real estate market. It is negative for equities in the short term and positive for bonds.The question is how long will the pain remain (for equity markets)six months or one year? I am hoping its six months, but thats just an initial estimate. It all depends on how quickly they get the new money in place. If the new money comes in soon, things will not be so bad. If it goes beyond six months, the markets will be vulnerable.The real estate sector was already doing badly, thats hit, but then it was already lying on the ground. Autos, cement and housing finance were doing well, and are now going to be hit.On the positive side, tax revenues will rise and this will help in reining in the fiscal deficit. The other benefit will be to the bond market and currency. The currency has been very stable and this will be a positive for it.How do you think the governments move will impact the chances of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in the state elections next year?It is a very bold move by the government because it could backfire. It is very risky. (With) any such move, you cannot be 100% sure if the practical implementation will work. How long it will take to deal with the inevitable teething issues.The Modi government will complete two-and-a-half years later this month. How do you assess its time in office?There have been dramatic reforms, but the big missing link has been that we have not had the big capitalization of state-run banks. It is still a work in progress.There has been a lot of pressure on banks to own up to the bad loans and there has been a lot of red ink reported. So, that is progress. I have been hoping that you will see consolidation of public sector banks. The setting up of the banking bureau is also a positive. But because the big recapitalization is missing, it is delaying economic recovery.But otherwise, demonetization is one of the biggest reforms. GST (goods and services tax) is in the works, bankruptcy is also a positive in the long term, but it will take many years. The law for regulating the property market is important.How will you rate the government on reforms?I will give the government an 8 out of 10.Is India still an attractive investment destination?India is still a very attractive destination on a long-term basis. It is not the best market in the next three months. The key thing to watch out will be how deep and how long the economic fallout from this attack on cash will last.Will this move impact corporate earnings as well?The market was expecting corporate earnings to pick up, but that is being delayed now. I am hoping that it is not more than six months. If it does not resolve within that time, then the market is very vulnerable.What do you make of Donald Trumps victory?It does not mean anything for India, as it is more dependent on the domestic story. The impact on the other emerging markets so far is that the US bond market is sold off, and that has led to pressure on emerging market debt, which is selling off. People made a lot of money in emerging market bonds this year, and are now rushing to sell. However, the Indian debt market is not the worst-hit. Indian equities, right now, are completely driven by the domestic development of demonetization.Investment demand has not picked up in India. When do you think that will pick up?In terms of investment cycle, there are three areas that can get it up. The first is government-driven infrastructure, which is happening; capital expenditure, which is still low; and the third one is real estate, which has taken a hit. So, the investment cycle is not going to recover anytime soon.A lot of IPOs with unique propositions hit the market this year. What are your thoughts on the same?The more important asset class that is emerging in India is stressed debt. To me, that is more interesting than the IPOs. Thats a sign that the banking system is beginning to get cleaned up.We had a change of guard at the Reserve Bank of India. Your views?Monetary policy is easier under Urjit Patel, but I am hoping that the pressure on the banks to clean up their books is maintained.",2016-11-15,HopZtiyhtQkhttZeSIi2vL,CLSA MD Christopher Wood on Narendra Modis demonetization move against black money and impact on markets,both,02:36,"Demonetization a bold move, but could hurt markets for 6 months: Christopher Wood"

After the June quarter results were announced, its shares fell 11% in two trading sessions.Thankfully for investors, the September quarter results werent way off the mark vis-a-vis the Streets expectations.IndiGo reported an operating profit of Rs195.6 crore, 2% lower than what analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities had estimated.But there isnt much to get excited about in the results either.For one, pricing pressures have continued. Although this was expected, given the increased competitive pressure, the 11% year-on-year decline in yield is more than what some analysts estimated. For instance, Kotak Institutional Equities and Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd had expected yields to decline 8% and 8.7%, respectively.At the time of announcing the June quarter results, IndiGo had said it will re-think matching fares more aggressively with competitors. The silver lining in this story is that while pricing pressures have persisted, robust load factors have compensated to some extent. IndiGos load factor during the past quarter was 82.2%, compared with 78.4% for the same period last year.But that wasnt enough to cap the decline in revenue per available seat km (RASK), which declined to Rs3.12 from Rs3.36 during the same time frame. RASK is total revenue net of finance income per available seat km.A slower rate of increase in other expenses and employee costs facilitated 11% Ebitdar growth to Rs967.7 crore. Thats despite the fact that fuel costs as a percentage of revenues increased 217 basis points to 37% last quarter. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Ebitdar is earnings before finance income and cost, taxes, depreciation, amortization and aircraft and engine rentals. Ebitdar margin declined to 23.2%, compared with 24.6% in the same period last year.After the seasonally lean September quarter, it will be interesting to watch how the stronger December quarter shapes up. Load factors may continue to remain healthy but analysts dont foresee much respite on pricing pressure. The company said in a post earnings conference call that the competition levels remain high.Industry passenger growth is encouraging, with passengers carried by domestic airlines in January-September 2016 increasing 23%.

-0.31,"Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltds results themselves brought in good news, beating Street estimates, but no progress on the Halol plant front will be a disappointment. The management said it has invited the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to inspect the plant, which was the status post-June quarter as well. A resolution to the issues raised by FDA pertaining to this plant is expected to clear the way for products that have been filed from this site.
				   
				The companys gross sales rose by 13.2% from a year ago to Rs7,764 crore, on the back of an 11% increase in India while the US market grew by 9% in dollar terms. The surprise element this quarter was from its other operating income, which came in at Rs501 crore against Rs15 crore a year ago, and Rs236 crore sequentially. That resulted in its revenue rising by 20.2% and since most of other operating income flows directly to profitability, its Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) rose by 69%.The company said it received $45 million (about Rs300 crore) as a milestone payment for a drug under development. Although its US market sales declined by 9%, this can be attributed to the end of exclusivity period sales of generic Gleevec, which boosted sales in the June quarter. The September quarter saw only one month of sales in the exclusivity period. Given the size of that drugs sales, add to that the fact that its subsidiary Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltds sales declined sequentially, Sun Pharmas base business appears to have  done relatively better than expected.Recently, the company said it has launched authorized generic versions of four variants of olmesartan, used to treat high blood pressure, in the US market in an agreement with Daiichi Sankyo Inc. Daiichis products collectively had sales of $2.5 billion in the 12-months ended August 2016 and one can expect Sun Pharma to get a share of these revenues, which should boost US market sales in this quarter.That should give shareholders something to look forward to but the magic words they are really waiting to hear is an EIR for the Halol plant. EIR stands for establishment inspection report and okays the plant as being compliant again. While Sun Pharmas quarterly results present a picture of a company that is growing and is in good health, the end to the long-drawn Halol episode is what investors are awaiting. Recent news on a probe on suspected drug price collusion in the US by the Department of Justice has done nothing to soothe their nerves.

0.05,"Britannia Industries Ltd saw sustained volume growth in the September quarter and also reported a pickup in the biscuits market that augurs well for the future. A fall in its margins left investors fretting, but a bigger worry is the effect of the currency exchange drive on consumption in the near term. All told, its shares are down by 7.7% from a week ago.
				   
				The companys stand-alone performance showed a 12.1% increase in sales while its costs rose by a significantly higher 17.7%. Sugar prices appear to be the main culprit although some firming up is visible in other key inputs too, such as oil and flour. Its operating profit margin declined by 70 basis points from a year ago and its net profit rose by 10.7%. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Taking across-the-board price hikes and passing on the full cost increase is difficult, given stiff competition and weak demand conditions. Britannias results statement hints as much, when it says its focus is to remain competitive and gain market share. The management expects the improvement seen in the biscuits market sales to continue, given the good monsoon and pay hikes for central government employees.The companys base business volume growth rose by 10% in the quarter, maintaining levels seen in the past two quarters. Its consolidated business, which includes the dairy and overseas segments, saw sales grow by 11% while costs grew by 17.2% and here, its operating profit margin narrowed by 92 basis points. Net profit growth was a mere 5.8%. Investors in the company are not accustomed to low earnings growth and would be hoping this is a blip. That explains the wobble in its share price.What next? The increase in raw material prices is a trend that has sustained. If the uptrend in biscuit sales continues, companies will be more confident of taking price hikes to pass on higher costs. The current dip in margins should not be a long-term concern then. Consumers are likely to postpone discretionary/impulse purchases, which is likely to affect Britannia. That may keep the shares under pressure for some time till a clearer picture on the impact on consumption emerges. If the worry clouds over consumption blow away in a few months and biscuit market sales resume their upward march, Britannia is primed to take advantage of it.",2016-11-15,IQsABakIUyjhNEyD671WbN,"A fall in its margins left Britannia investors fretting, but a bigger worry is the effect of the currency exchange drive on consumption in the near term",competitor,07:46,Q2 results: Britannia short-changed in the near term
-0.53,"Mumbai: Cyrus Mistry, the ousted chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, on Sunday rebutted the 10 November statement of the Tata group holding company that alleged Mistry was seeking to control the main group operating firms to the exclusion of Tata Sons and other Tata representatives.
				   
				Tata Sons statement alludes to Mistry having created a new structure where operating companies were drifting away. This is furthest from the truth, said the statement from Mistrys office, while explaining the changes were made to reflect the contextual difference within which the group currently functions.The corporate governance framework in India has considerably tightened in recent times with more stringent rules on the independence of directors, female directors, board evaluation, and so on. To meet this increased scrutiny, several new policies and frameworks were developed at the group centre and deployed across operating companies, said the statement.As such, prior to Mistrys chairmanship, all board members of Tata Sons, with the exception of him, were internal to the group, being either vice-chairmen of group firms or members of the group corporate centre (GCC), said the statement, while pointing out that the structure is exactly the opposite today.According to the statement, the requirement to have 30% Trust nominees and 30% independent directors meant that in addition to Ishaat Hussain and Mistry, there was possibly only one more senior GCC member who could be on board of Tata Sons. This limited the involvement of other group centre members on Tata Sons board, said the note, adding that in the past three years, all these internal members, with the exception of Hussain, had retired. This was a generational change.As agreed with the Tata Sons board, the governance mechanism to protect Tata Sons interests and ensure adequate group representation on operating company boards was to have group executive council (GEC) members, other senior group centre members such as Farokh Subedar and S. Padmanabhan, and select chief executive officers such as Bhaskar Bhat and Noel Tata on the boards of operating firms.In addition, of the nine independent directors on boards of operating firms like Tata Chemicals Ltd and Indian Hotels Co. Ltd which have shown support for the ousted chairman, six were appointed during Ratan Tatas tenure. Moreover, two of these directors also serve as trustees on Tata Trusts.To question the independence of the directors by Tata Sons is truly unfortunate, given that the country acknowledges them as stalwarts of India Inc. To suggest ulterior objectives and clever strategy can sway these eminent names in undertaking their fiduciary duties and in discharging the duties mandated by statute as independent directors is absolutely astonishing and really speaks to how low Tata Sons has unfortunately stooped in their public statements, said the statement.",2016-11-13,ISo8Qt9SvuSunbtiVmJD1H,Cyrus Mistrys office says a new structure was created with an eye on better transparency,competitor,18:20,Cyrus Mistry rebuts Tatas takeover bid claim
0.38,"The nervousness in the ICICI Bank Ltd stock was apparent on Friday when it fell 3.5% before the announcement of the banks June quarter financials after the market closed.
				   
				Although the 25% fall in ICICI Banks net profit from a year ago isnt exactly a surprise, the fact is the fall was cushioned to some extent by a rise in non-interest income and lower tax outgo.Treasury gains were a big contributor to the increase in non-interest income.But what the Street really cares about is news whether the banks asset quality woes are ebbing. On the face of it, ICICI Banks gross non-performing assets (NPAs) have increased by a mere 5 basis points sequentially. Gross NPAs have risen from 4.72% of customer assets in December 2015 to 5.82% in March 2016 and are now at 5.87%.But one big reason for mitigating the rise in gross NPAs is that assets worth Rs.2,332 crore were sold to asset reconstruction companies (ARCs). Had that not been the case, the number would have been higher. The net NPA ratio has gone up much more, from 2.98% in March to 3.35%. Thats because provisioning came down a bit and the provisioning coverage ratio slipped from 61% at end-March to 57.1% by end-June.Another dampener was slippages. The March 2016 quarter saw total slippages at Rs.7,003 crore, which rose to Rs.8,249 crore in the June quarter. This number does not include the assets sold to ARCs. According to some analysts, the rate of slippages is worrisome and could lead to nasty surprises in future.The rise in bad loans took its toll on income growth, as widely expected, with net interest income (NII) rising a mere 0.9% year-on-year (y-o-y). Net interest margin, a key indicator of profitability, fell to 3.16% from 3.37% in March.In all this gloom and doom, there were some bright spots. The banks bad loan watchlist declined to Rs.38,723 crore in June from Rs.44,000 crore, sequentially; overall advances grew by 12% and current and savings (casa) deposits saw a y-o-y growth of 18%. But these are unlikely to allay the markets worries on asset quality, especially since the lions share of the reduction in the watchlist was because the loans slipped into becoming non-performing assets.ICICI Bank shares have underperformed the Bank Nifty in the past one year. It has been a laggard when compared with the Nifty Private Bank Index on a year-to-date basis.

Ltd (ONGC). 
				   
				Calgary-based Niko Resources Ltd, which holds 10% interest in RIL-operated KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block, said the partners believe they are not liable for the amount claimed by the government of India. In an emailed statement, it said it is considering joining RIL in invoking the dispute resolution mechanism in the production sharing contract (PSC). The oil ministry had on 3 November issued a notice to RIL, Niko and UKs BP plc seeking $1.47 billion for producing in the seven years ended 31 March 2016 about 338.332 million British thermal units of gas that had seeped or migrated from state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp.s (ONGC) blocks into adjoining KG-D6 in Bay of Bengal. After deducting $71.71 million royalty paid on the gas produced and adding an interest at the rate of Libor plus 2%, totalling $149.86 million, a total demand of $1.55 billion was made on RIL, BP and Niko. RIL had on Friday stated that it proposes to invoke the dispute resolution mechanism in the PSC and issue a notice of arbitration to the government. RIL remains convinced of being able to fully justify and vindicate its position that the governments claim is not sustainable, the company had said, adding it has worked within the boundaries of the KG-D6 block awarded to it and has complied with all applicable regulations and provisions of the PSC. The claim of the government is based on misreading and misinterpretation of key elements of the PSC and is without precedent in the oil and gas industry, anywhere in the world, it had said. BP, which holds the remaining 30% interest, said it is evaluating its options. BP believes that the action taken is neither in line with well-established global practices nor is it in line with the PSC. We are aligned and working with our partners to evaluate our options to achieve an effective resolution, a BP India spokesperson said. Originally, ONGC had sued RIL for producing gas that had migrated from its blocks KG-DWN-98/2 (KG-D5) and Godavari PML in the KG basin to adjoining KG-D6 block of RIL. Under direction of the Delhi High Court, the government had appointed a one-man committee under retired justice A P Shah to go into the issue. The panel in its report on 29 August felt that the government and not ONGC is entitled to compensation.Subsequently, the ministry asked its upstream technical arm DGH to calculate the amount of compensation and a demand notice was slapped on RIL-BP-Niko. The committee has concluded that the contractors (RIL- BP-Niko) production of migrated gas and retention of ensuing benefits amounts to unjust enrichment, since the production sharing contract (PSC)... does not permit a contractor to produce and sell migrated gas, the 3 November demand note said.

				In the digital economy, banks that have managed the transition to digital interfaces and e-commerce portals have the highest rated consumer experience, says a new survey. Banking and e-commerce are the leaders when it comes to providing consumer experience whereas the automotive industry, which includes four and two-wheelers, are at the bottom of the pack out of nine industries surveyed, by Hansa Customer Equity Pvt. Ltd. a marketing and analytics research firm. A common thread across the laggards is that they are industries where service delivery involves external stake holders like dealerships, travel offices, advisors and agents, said the study, based on a field survey, covering approximately 2,200 respondents while pointing out that five out of the nine sectors which include banking, e-commerce retail, healthcare and insurance offer above industry level expectations whereas the remaining fourairlines, travel services, four-wheelers and two-wheelers offer below industry level customer experience. Nearly four-fifths of the people surveyed are not happy with the customer experience they receive as it lacked on key parameters like ease of interaction, or achieving purpose, interaction satisfaction and information availability, said the survey which is one of the first of its kind based on consumer experience across nine industries in the top eight cities stratified for gender, socio-economic classification (A and B), age groups and geography. Interestingly, customers with larger discretionary spending capacities are perceiving a poor customer experience potentially eroding companies share of their wallets, said the survey. The benchmark for customer service is no longer your peer in the industry. Its the best consumer experience platform which could be a digital channel, said Swaminathan, chief executive officer and co-founder, Hansa Cequity, while explaining that digital channels are giving better experience than human channels and companies need to move towards hybrid channels which is a mix of automated and physical channels.To be sure, in-person accounts for the largest share of consumer interaction accounting for 61%, followed by website (17.5%), mobile app (11.5%) and phone call (7.8%). The usage of digital engagement channels of email, SMS and social media by customers for engagement is low at just 2%, said the survey while pointing out that a significant opportunity exists for companies to lower their costs of engagement by better leveraging email, SMS and social media. Also the satisfaction with these channels is very different. Customers are very satisfied with using mobile apps as a means to engage and have rated interactions with mobile apps as three times better than emails.

Apple didnt provide a technical reason for the delay nor a new shipping date.The delay comes on the eve of Apples scheduled on Thursday event for its updated Mac computer line, when the AirPods availability also was expected to be announced.The AirPods delay is the first hardware-related postponement in more than five years from the Cupertino, California-based company. A version of the iPhone 4 in the colour white was announced in June 2010, but didnt ship to customers until April 2011 because of a production problem. On the software side, Apple delayed the release of iTunes 11 in 2012 by a month to fix bugs.Reviews of pre-production models of the AirPods suggested the device needed fine-tuning. During my testing one of the AirPods had trouble holding a charge, so Apple swapped it out, Walt Mossberg, of the technology website The Verge, wrote in September. Other reviewers noticed problems with music playback, a key feature of the AirPods.The introduction of the product spurred criticism that the cordless earphones could easily be lost.

That compared with the $5.29 billion average estimate of five analysts compiled by Bloomberg News.A UK regulators altered treatment of HSBCs stake in Chinas Bank of Communications Co. cut the British banks risk-weighted assets by $120.9 billion. That freed up $5.6 billion, which increased the lenders capital ratio and will help to support its dividend and any future share buybacks, as well as providing a buffer for the continuing uncertain regulatory environment, Gulliver said.This should be enough to allow the bank to maintain the dividend next year, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analysts led by Chirantan Barua said in a note. For yield investors who have been the source of support for valuation of this stock, this keeps the stock in the safety zone into the next six to nine months.The companys shares rose 2.3% in Hong Kong as of 1.28pm after earlier gaining as much as 3%.The banks common equity Tier 1 ratio rose to 13.9% from 12.1% three months earlier. That beat estimates of Morgan Stanley analysts, who expected an improvement to 12.9%.Almost six years into his tenure, Gulliver is striving to maintain revenue while paring global operations to trim $5 billion of annual expenses. His efforts to redeploy more assets into Asia have been complicated by Chinas slowing economy, while the bank is also navigating tougher capital rules, low interest rates and misconduct scandals.The stock had climbed 11% in London this year, the second-most among major European lenders behind Standard Chartered Plc at Fridays close. Both get the vast majority of their profit in Asia and report in dollars, limiting the impact of Britains vote to leave the European Union. Even so, HSBC still trades below its book value.Adjusted revenue gained 2.4% to $12.8 billion. Adjusted operating costs fell 3.5% to $7.25 billion, compared with the $7.33 billion average estimate of the five analysts surveyed.Since Gulliver started restructuring the bank in 2011, hes slashed headcount by about 44,000 and pledged 25,000 cuts last year, exiting at least 80 businesses. Globally, its retreated to 71 countries and territories from 88. Nevertheless, as with most European lenders, HSBC has been struggling to boost profitability. In August, management removed a target to surpass a 10% return on equity by the end of 2017, citing economic and political uncertainties, and stepped back from its progressive dividend policy.Adjusted pretax profit in Asia climbed 10% to $3.8 billion in the quarter from a year earlier, while Europe reported a 5.4% gain to $863 million.At the retail banking and wealth management division, adjusted profit rose to $1.8 billion from $1.5 billion a year earlier. In global banking and markets, which houses the investment bank, adjusted profit jumped to $2.5 billion from $1.93 billion in the period. The gain was primarily driven by the banks fixed-income businesses, which gained market share in Europe, HSBC said.Finance director Iain Mackay has said revenue is suffering because of record-low interest rates around the world, a particular problem for HSBC because it houses more than $400 billion of surplus deposits. Mackay said in August the lender would lose about $100 million of net interest income a year as a result of the Bank of England cutting its main interest rate by 25 basis points after Brexit.Adjusted loan impairment charges increased to $566 million in the third quarter from $434 million a year earlier.

0.09,"New Delhi: The price paid for solar power in India at auction is set to fall below last years record lows for the South Asia nation, driven by plummeting panel prices, falling interest rates and competition among developers seeking a slice of the countrys renewables market.
				   
				Prices could dip lower than the Rs4.34 a kilowatt-hour offered in auctions held in Rajasthan a year ago, according to at least one developer of solar projects in India.This year we will see prices fall below Rs4 a kilowatt-hour for sure and it will be viable, said Rahul Munjal, chairman and managing director of Hero Future Energies Pvt., the clean-energy arm of Hero Group, one of Indias largest automakers.In 2016, countries from Chile to the United Arab Emirates broke records with deals to generate electricity from sunshine for less than 3 cents a kilowatt-hour, half the average global cost of coal power. With China and Japan joining the competitive-bidding bandwagon, as much as 25 gigawatts of solar capacity could be awarded through auctions this year globally, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.We feel interest rates will go down and the cost of solar panels will fall, so these will have a great effect on breaching the Rs4 a unit-mark, said Hero Futures Munjal, adding that hes looking at a 500 basis-point decline in domestic interest rates.Hero Future Energies, backed by the International Financial Corp., operates 360 megawatts of wind and solar capacity and has another 1.4 gigawatts of projects in the pipeline. The company plans to participate in some of the upcoming auctions.A decline in costs is one reason developers say prices at auction will drop.After falling 30% last year, the price of ordinary multi-crystalline silicon modules is expected to fall another 20% in 2017, according to London-based BNEF. Since 2009, solar prices are down 62%, with every part of the supply chain trimming costs.We expect these modules to sell for around $0.32 per watt, Jenny Chase, BNEFs chief solar analyst, said in a research note.Pent-up demand for nearly two gigawatts of solar capacity up for auctions in India in the early part of the year will also drive prices lower, said Rahul Goswami founder of Greenstone Energy Advisors, a boutique investment bank specializing in renewable energy deals in Asias third-largest economy.There is going to be a huge oversubscription in the coming auctions and everyone in 2017 will be looking at how do I go forward from my one gigawatt to 1.5 or 2 gigawatts, Goswami said in a phone interview, adding that fewer tenders in the last several months is adding to the pent-up demand.Auction processGreenstone, which is currently working to find an equity partner for Canadian renewable energy company SkyPower Ltds 350 megawatts of capacity under construction in India, concluded deals for 80 megawatts of solar capacity on behalf of Punj Lloyd Ltd in 2016. The investment bank also advised billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birlas Aditya Birla Nuvo Ltd on a tie-up with Dubai-based private equity investor The Abraaj Group to add solar power capacity in 2015.India is preparing to award 750 megawatts of solar capacity in Madhya Pradesh later this month and nearly 1 gigawatt more by March, according to state-run Solar Energy Corp. of India, the government agency that conducts Indias solar auctions.India adopted auctions in 2010 and is now racing to achieve Prime Minister Narendra Modis solar target of 100 gigawatts of capacity by 2022, a goal thats second only to China.Of the 25 gigawatts to be awarded through auctions, BNEFs Chase expects 8.5 gigawatts of that to be in India.

-1.0,"Multinational capital equipment manufacturer Siemens Ltds September quarter (fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016) did not sustain the strong comeback in performance seen in the earlier three quarters. It failed investor expectation on all fronts, undermining hopes of a strong revival at the company and in the economy.
				   
				Not surprisingly, the stock reacted adversely on Wednesday, closing at Rs1,055, about 2% lower from the previous day. In spite of this and the steady decline in the stock price over the last one year, Siemens trades at a rich valuation of 47 times estimated FY18 earnings.The September quarters performance did little to justify the valuation as the company disappointed on profits and margins. At 7.8%, the operating margin was 130 basis points lower year-on-year (y-o-y) and 120 basis points lower than forecast. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Of the six business segments, the energy segment that makes up nearly a third of total revenue was the bright spot, posting a strong 11% jump in revenue and a decent operating margin at 6.5%. The deplorable state of the power and gas industry is well delineated in the companys performancenet revenue contracted by 63% y-o-y and profitability dipped by 820 basis points. Other segments that faltered were mobility and building technologies, again mirroring the subdued environment in construction, real estate and logistics.Given the pessimism on the Street on economic growth following the demonetization drive, there may be little interest in the stock in the near term. The quarters huge 11-fold increase in net profit includes a Rs2,992 crore exceptional gain on sale of its healthcare business. Adjusted for this, the net profit rose by just 5.8% to Rs170 crore when compared to a year back. Note that it was 22% below Bloombergs average estimate for the quarter. If the stock has any positive news to ride on, it is the Rs10,800 crore order book at the end of the year, 13% higher from the year-ago level. Otherwise, the quarters order inflows were 21% lower. It was the earlier quarters performance that added up to close the full year with new orders of Rs12,064 crore, about 19% higher y-o-y. Be that as it may, interest in the stock has dwindled over the years given the lack of consistency in segmental performance that makes it hard to extrapolate future earnings.",2016-11-24,J1lTQehvqwZ3Y12neZJZCK,"Siemens Q2 results failed investor expectation on all fronts, undermining hopes of a strong revival at the company and in the economy",competitor,08:01,Siemens: Results dont support rich valuation
-0.84,"New York: Facebook has a tortured but financially advantageous relationship with its suppliersthat is, the people and companies that keep the social network stocked with posts, photos and videos. Those people and companies make Facebook an entertaining hangout. And Facebook essentially keeps all the money generated there. But that is about to change.
				   
				Facebook will start to test slotting commercials into the middle of videos that media and entertainment companies publish on the social network, tech news publication Recode reported on Monday. And the company has agreed to let the video creators keep 55% of the money from those video ads, just as YouTube does. Facebook executives until now havent been wild about slotting in ads before or within videos. People will fixate on Facebooks flip-flop, but the much, much bigger deal is the compensation change for the media and entertainment companies that helped Facebook become the place where the world spends a huge share of its leisure hours. And the shift could damage the best business model in technology. Profit powerhouseOut of nearly 200 US companies with at least $15 billion in yearly sales, only five have wider operating profit margins than Facebook. For the most part, companies that publish political articles or cooking videos on Facebook dont make money directly from that material, although they use those items to assemble a big fan base and then point those people to websites and apps where the companies make money selling ads or subscriptions.Those articles and cooking videos keep users hanging out on Facebook, and the company keeps all the money it makes from selling advertisements that fill in gaps between those posts and videos they paid nothing to publish. It may not be fair, but it has made for a wildly successful and profitable business.If Facebook is now willing to give 55% of ad dollars from those video ads, that means cracks are emerging in Facebooks free ride with its army of content suppliers. Sharing money is more equitable but could damage Facebooks finances. Consider Alphabet Inc.s YouTube. The video website makes roughly one-third of the money Facebook generates from each user. Its not clear exactly why. Facebook may be doing a better job stuffing ads into every spot it can. Surely part of the gap is explained by Facebook paying almost nothing to stock the social network with posts, photos and video, while YouTube hands off 55 cents of every dollar it generates to the creators of popular videos.Facebook may be wagering that even if it must start giving away a cut of advertising money its worth it if companies have more financial incentives to create video for Facebook, which in turn will keep users coming back and staying for longer stretches. Facebook is an expert at making money from users attention. It may also be that Facebook had no choice.Some media and entertainment companies have started to complain about their inability to make money directly from videos and stories published on Facebook. It could be that Facebook is getting worried it will be left with too few cooking videos and Trump stories to keep users interested for hours.In any case, Facebooks crossing of the Rubicon on revenue sharing is an important moment. This could be the point in Facebooks development that helps it endure as the biggest and most valuable attention hog on the internet. Or it may be the step that helps Facebook stay popular but at too high a price.

				The Nikkei India Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), which tracks services sector firms on a monthly basis, stood at 48.7 in January, as against 46.8 in December 2016. A score above 50 denotes expansion and one below this level means contraction. While the index remained in the contraction zone for the third straight month, an improvement in the reading from the previous months level signalled that the sector is heading towards stabilization. Indias pivotal services sector remained in contraction territory in the opening month of 2017, with both new business and activity falling for the third straight month, said Pollyanna De Lima, economist at IHS Markit, and author of the report. ALSO READ: RBI may go for 25 bps repo rate cut next week: Deutsche BankThe survey further showed that input cost inflation slowed since December whereas average selling prices shrank again, which may prompt the RBI to go in for an accommodative monetary policy. PMI price indicators point to relatively muted inflationary pressures in the private sector economy.

-1.0,"Mumbai: When Dilip Shanghvi wants something, he has a track record of getting it. 
				   
				One executive, Srinivas Lanka, recalls the founder of Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd calling more than 100 times over three years with a job offer two decades ago. Shanghvi was setting off on an acquisition-fueled strategy to transform his small generic drugmaker into an industry powerhouse, and he wouldnt take no for an answer.In the end, Shanghvi won over Lanka, who agreed to leave his job at global pharma giant Novartis AG and sign on as the executive director in charge of Suns Indian business in 1996, staying until 1999. A lot of entrepreneurs used to call me, but not many had this kind of fire in their belly, said Lanka. I thought this guy has some different blood in him.That kind of relentless drive has helped make Sun Indias biggest drugmaker and best performing stock over the last 20 yearsand Shanghvi the countrys second richest person, with an estimated net worth of $15 billion. Yet now, with Suns shares on track for their worst annual decline since 2008, Shanghvi, 61, has seen his deal-making mystique called into question as Sun faces an array of challenges at home and abroad.Shanghvis largest ever deal, the purchase of Indian rival Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd in 2015, has been bogged down by a slowdown in emerging markets and bans by US regulators at acquired factories that threaten his record as a turnaround artist. Meanwhile, the political uproar over drug prices in the US means additions to Suns portfolio there that have driven revenue and the share price look increasingly unsustainable.After 15 years where sales grew at a compound annual rate of about 30%, Sun this year has forecast growth would slow to between 8 and 10%, according to company statements. The shares have tumbled more than 7% this year.Nothing is visible at the moment which will provide positive upside, said Ranjit Kapadia, an analyst covering the stock at Centrum Broking Pvt. Ltd. Theres nothing on the plate.Shanghvi declined to be interviewed for this story.Theres no denying that Shanghvi, who graduated with a degree in commerce from the University of Calcutta, has had a terrific run since launching Sun in 1983. Early on, the company differentiated itself from the crowd of Indian makers of generic drugs with a focus on high-margin psychiatric drugs, then branched into medicines targeting chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease, now more common in prospering India.They focused on chronic diseases much before everybody else did, said Nilesh Gupta, managing director of Lupin Ltd., Indias second biggest drug company by market capitalization. Thats how they got completely entrenched in the market. A chronic prescription is a lifetime prescription, an acute one is a ten day one.All the while theres been a steady stream of acquisitions, alternately bolstering the firms growth or catapulting it to the next level. Since 2001, there have been more than 20 deals worth $5.6 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Always a voracious consumer of industry intelligence, when it came to acquisitions Shanghvi would mobilize the whole firm to do due diligence and look for troubled targets that could be bought at a discount, said Shyamal Ghosh, a former Sun executive director who retired in 2011. Finding weaknesses of the acquired companies was very easy for him, he said.Both Shanghvis eye for value and his tenaciousness were exemplified in the 2010 takeover of Israel-based Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. It took a three-year legal battle to force Taros former chairman to abide by the terms of a previously terminated takeover agreement requiring him to sell his controlling stake to Sun, but soon after taking Taro in hand Sun had ferreted out a way to squeeze out more profit: steady price increases on Taros portfolio of medicines.Since taking control those price hikes have amounted to a 300 percent increase across Taros portfolio, according to data provider IMS Health. The move lit a fire under Taros profit margin, which reached nearly 60 percent last year, according to Bloomberg data.With each year profit margins grew at Taro, Suns shares climbed, setting the stage for its biggest ever acquisition, the $4.1 billion purchase of Ranbaxy. With the success of Taro as a precedent investors celebrated the closing of the Ranbaxy deal in 2015, sending Suns shares to a record.Since then, Sun has led a less charmed life. Shanghvi now faces an array of challenges, starting with a share price which has tumbled about 35% since its peak in April 2015, wiping out more than $12 billion in shareholder value.The exposure to emerging markets Sun bought with Ranbaxy has proven ill-timed as a collapse in commodity prices abruptly sent nations like Brazil, Russia and Venezuela into recession. Their plunging currencies translated into an immediate hit to the 13% of revenue Sun now gets from emerging markets outside India.Worse has been the hit to Suns US revenues, 50% of the total, from sanctions by regulators in that country. With the Ranbaxy deal, Shanghvi bought four plants saddled with export bans from the US Food and Drug Administration because of deficient manufacturing practices. But just as he was getting started turning them around one of Suns own key facilities received a warning letter of its own from the US FDA. Though less severe than the outright bans faced by the acquired factories the warning letter prevented the launch of new US products from the plant and hampered production there, slowing revenue growth in Suns core business as it added regulatory costs on top of those he bought with Ranbaxy.Drug pricesWhats more, the US political backlash over high drug prices that has drawn scrutiny to the business practices at drugmakers like Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. and Mylan NV adds a political risk to price hikes at Taro, which combined with increased competition is starting to make the strategy look unsustainable. Last month, Taro said it had received a subpoena from the US department of justice asking about pricing for its products and communications with competitors. Taro didnt respond to a request for comment.What the street is waiting for is for other businesses to sort of take over from Taro, said Nitin Agarwal, an analyst at IDFC Securities Ltd who follows the company. To an extent thats not happened and the stock had been soft the last year and a half.Sun has requested the US Food and Drug Administration reinspect its facility under a warning letter and cannot say when that will occur, Freddy Castro, a company spokesman said in an e-mailed statement. The company is also planning to submit one of the four Ranbaxy facilities for re-inspection this year, he said, declining to comment on Taro.The Ranbaxy transaction is living up to expectations and is on track to realize the expected $300 million of synergies by year three, he said.Looking aheadNevertheless 61% of analysts covering Sun, including Agarwal, have the equivalent of a buy rating on the company, according to a survey conducted by Bloomberg. Most point out that while it may have been the acquisitions that catapulted Sun to the number one spot it was years of steady growth, fueled by Shanghvis ability to spot the next big treatment area, that got him within striking distance.With the market for the simple generic medicines he built his business on getting saturated, Shanghvi has already begun steering his company into more complex ones that promise higher margins, like dermatological creams, injectable medicines and highly regulated pain killers. Next up is building a portfolio of completely novel medicines, some of them developed in house. All that means increased spending on research and development -- for a bigger, though less certain, payday.Of course theres always acquisitions. But with Sun still waiting on the full benefits of Ranbaxy, Shanghvi has said hes not on the lookout for big deals at the moment, even as theyve avoided totally shutting the door should an opportunity arise.Nevertheless, Suns stock remains becalmed as Shanghvi continues searching for a lever that can return his companys growth to the form its had most of the last 20 years. Those whove worked with him closest in that time say, in true Shanghvi fashion, he wont rest until he finds it.He has an insatiable hunger to grow bigger and bigger, former executive director Ghosh said. Hes extremely focused. Hes not interested in anything else except the pharmaceutical business. Bloomberg",2016-10-13,JO3Q4ROOkEeIKlvt25ZpcO,Dilip Shanghvi s deal-making mystique is called into question as Sun Pharmaceuticals faces an array of challenges at home and abroad,competitor,09:41,"Dilip Shanghvi, M&A artist behind Indias best stock, now faces his greatest test"

				Net profit for the quarter stood at Rs579.57 crore as compared with Rs2,175.30 crore a year ago. A Bloomberg poll of 22 analysts had forecast a net profit of Rs830.30 crore.During the third quarter, the bank saw slippages worth Rs4,560 crore, largely in its so-called watch­list. The bank had, at the start of the year, created a list of corporate loans worth Rs22,628 crore which had a high probability of slipping into the non-performing category.In the nine months ended 31 December, about 51% or Rs11,537 crore had gone bad, with loans worth Rs2,698 crore going sour in October-December alone. However, slippages from the watchlist came down by 48% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. The bank also saw Rs1,631 crore worth loans slipping outside the list, of which Rs975 crore came from the banks corporate loan book.In a presentation, Axis Bank said that about 98% of the corporate slippages outside the watchlist were old loans which had been on the banks books since financial year 2010-11 or earlier. The total slippages seem to have turned the corner. The peak is behind us, said Jairam Sridharan, chief financial officer, Axis Bank.Provisions and contingencies rose 4.78% to Rs3,795.80 crore in the quarter from Rs3,622.74 crore a quarter ago. On a year-on-year basis, they surged 433% from Rs712.59 crore. With this, the banks provision coverage ratio rose to 64% from 60% earlier.The banks gross non-performing assets (NPAs) rose 220.9% to Rs20,466.82 crore at the end of the December quarter from Rs6,378.65 crore in the September quarter. On a year-on-year basis, it jumped 257.56% from Rs5,724.05 crore.As a percentage of total loans, gross NPAs stood at 5.22% at the end of the December quarter, as compared to 4.17% in the previous quarter and 1.68% in the year-ago quarter. Net NPAs were at 2.18% in the December quarter compared with 2.02% in the previous quarter and 0.75% in the same quarter last year.Net interest income (NII), or the core income a bank earns by giving loans, increased just 4.12% to Rs4,333.73 crore from Rs4,162.06 crore last year. Other income jumped 45.45% to Rs3,400.21 crore from Rs2,337.78 crore in the same period last year.Deposits rose 9.6% to Rs3.71 trillion while advances rose 10.1% to Rs3.47 trillion.While the banks retail loans showed a 19% growth year-on-year, corporate loans grew 4% and SME loans rose 5% from a year ago.We had earlier expected our credit growth to be in the high teens for this financial year. That might be a little optimistic right now. Weve moderated our expectations accordingly and we should mark a credit growth which is slightly lower, Sridharan said without giving any clear guidance for credit growth.Analysts believe that the slippages are along expected lines.The banks focus has been on cleaning up its books, which is a positive. We may not see much of a sharp correction in the stock price as most negatives have been factored in, said Siddharth Purohit, senior banking analyst at Angel Broking Ltd.Another private sector lender, Yes Bank Ltd, too announced its third quarter results on Thursday.Yes Banks net profit for the December quarter rose 30.62% to Rs882.63 crore compared with Rs675.74 crore a year ago.

Research by Credit Suisse shows that in the US, S&P 500 companies spent $572 billion on buybacks in 2015, or 1.5 times of what they spent on dividends. For a number of shareholders, buybacks trump dividends both in terms of tax efficiency and the flexibility they offer. Ironically, in India, the government seems to have overplayed its hand and magnified the relative advantages of buybacks. In the 2016-17 Union budget, finance minister Arun Jaitley introduced an additional tax of 10% on any dividend income of more than Rs.10 lakh. Dividend distribution tax already amounted to 20.4% of payouts.For stocks that have been held for over a year, the buyback route entails a tax outgo of only 0.1%, which is essentially the securities transaction tax (STT) applicable for the transaction. Since 1 July 2015, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has allowed listed companies to make tender buyback offers through stock exchanges. For such transactions, long-term capital gains tax is exempt.Earlier, when companies werent allowed to make tender buyback offers through stock exchanges, investors would end up paying a 10% long-term capital gains tax. To be sure, buybacks through tender offers have picked up since FY16.For high dividend earners, the tax savings through a buyback issue are substantial. Bharti Airtel Ltd holds a 71.7% stake in Bharti Infratel Ltd. The latter has announced a buyback of Rs.2,000 crore. If the promoter tenders shares in proportion to its shareholding, it will take home more than Rs.1,400 crore after accounting for STT and other costs. If Infratel had chosen the dividend route instead, the net take home would be only around Rs.1,000 crore.There is likely to be increasing pressure from shareholders to shift to buybacks, given the tax efficiency. One likely pushback is that Sebi imposes a restriction on companies buying back sharesi.e. that they cant issue fresh equity for a period after the buyback. From a shareholders perspective, buybacks offer the flexibility of foregoing the payout by the company and staying fully invested with the company. They can do this by simply opting to not tender shares in the buyback. With dividends, there is no such option. Of course, one can always use dividend proceeds to buy additional shares, although academic studies show that reinvestment is typically rare and forms a fraction of all dividends received.Another peculiarity about buybacks is that while all shareholders are treated the same with dividends, the pricing of the buyback determines which category of shareholders benefit. Michael J. Mauboussin and Dan Callahan of Credit Suisse point out in a note titled Disbursing Cash to Shareholders, Buybacks benefit ongoing shareholders when management buys stock that is undervalued and benefit outgoing shareholders when the stock is overvalued. Since management should focus on building value per share for continuing shareholders, it should always try to buy back shares that are undervalued.This shouldnt normally matter in a tender offer, where investors can participate in the same proportion as their shareholding. Even so, empirical evidence shows that some shareholders fail to participate, even when they are incentivized by a substantial premium. Needless to say, investors need to keep a close eye on the pricing of the offer; but companies, too, would do well to avoid buybacks by paying a large premium.",2016-07-11,JdsOi2pXYKNjGVP8vvJUFP,"Along with three large share buybacks by government-owned companies, Indian companies have announced buybacks worth over ,2,1000 crore so far this year",both,01:58,Govts second dividend tax spurs buybacks
-0.71,"A close relation of one of my friends, a senior executive at a multilateral agency for years now, is quite upset because her name does not feature in the media list of probables for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governors post. Ditto about an economist attached to an Indian think tank. This gentleman has stopped attending parties to avoid embarrassment of explaining to his peers why his name is not there.
				   
				In the past one month, since governor Raghuram Rajan made it public that he would not seek a reappointment, both print media and the TV channels are throwing up every possible name as his successor. The scene used to be very different on earlier occasions. Each time a governor was stepping down, only a handful of names would do the rounds as his possible successor. Among the names that appeared more than once was that of Montek Singh Ahluwalia. Lets take a look at the list this time around. I am putting them an alphabetical order to avoid giving an impression that I have a favourite or I think X has a better chance than Y.A: Arundhati Bhattacharya (chairman of State Bank of India), Arvind Panagariya (vice chairman of NITI Aayog, a government of India policy think tank that replaced Planning Commission), Arvind Subramanian (an economist and chief economic adviser to the government of India), Ashok Chawla (former chairman of Competition Commission of India), and Ashok Lahiri (former chief economic adviser to the government).B: Bimal Jalan (who had a stint as RBI governor between 1997 and 2003).J: Jugal Kishore Mohapatra (former rural development secretary).K: Kaushik Basu (former chief economic adviser to the government of India and now chief economist at the World Bank) and K.V. Kamath (head of the New Development Bank of the BRICS countries).P: Parthasarathi Shome (former adviser to Indian finance minister).R: Ratan Wattal (former finance secretary and now a liaison officer with the Jammu & Kashmir government to ensure flow of funds to the state on a fast track), R. Vaidyanathan (a professor at Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore), and Rakesh Mohan (a former RBI deputy governor).S: Shaktikanta Das (economic affairs secretary), Subir Gokarn (former RBI deputy governor and currently an executive director at the International Monetary Fund), and Sumit Bose (former finance secretary).U: U.K. Sinha (chairman of Securities and Exchange Board of India) and Urjit Patel (an RBI deputy governor).V: Vijay Kelkar (former finance secretary) and Vinod Rai (former Comptroller and Auditor General of India and now chairman of Bank Boards Bureau).Even after this, I may have missed a few names and apologize for that. There could be quite a few reasons behind so many names being cited as a possible successor to Rajan.One, many of the newspapers and TV channels indulge in speculation as they love to tell the world I told you so in case one of the many names being mentioned hits the bulls eye.Two, unlike in the past, there is a problem of plenty now and what we are witnessing is a fierce competition among a bunch of talented economists, bureaucrats and bankers for the job of Indias chief money man.Three, since we are relatively better off in terms of macroeconomic parameters, anybody can do this job. Jalan took over in the thick of east Asian crisis; D. Subbarao came in immediately after the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.; and Rajan occupied the seat when inflation was in double digits and the local currency was fast depreciating against the dollar. Now, we have a stable currency, relatively low inflation and low current account deficit.Finally, there could be trial balloons being floated by junior and not-so-junior bureaucrats through news-hungry media to gauge the public sentiment even as former governor Subbaraos tell-all book Who Moved My Interest Rate has queered the pitch for the government. Its a caution to the incumbent on the uneasy relationship that an RBI governor can have with the finance ministry and a message to the ministry that a governor, however close he is to the government before he moves to the central bank, can spill the beans after he is out.The media frenzy to find Rajans successor reminds one of what had happened when Ratan Tata was retiring as chairman of Tata Sons. The long list, published over months, had many names from India and overseas but not Cyrus P. Mistry who actually succeeded him when Tata retired in December 2012. No one will be surprised if a dark horse emerges from nowhere for the governors post.Whoever comes may not have an easy job at hand. In the past one month, since Rajan announced his decision to go back to the academic world, the level of rupee has remained unchanged but the 10-year government bond yield has dropped from 7.5% to 7.27% and most bank stocks have risen, some of them substantially. Bankex, the representative industry index on BSE, has risen 7.3%. Out of 39 listed banks, only five stocks have fallenthree of them are associates of the State Bank of India, besides Central Bank of India and Punjab & Sind Bank. Among public sector banks, Punjab National Bank has risen close to 44%, Allahabad Bank 36% and Indian Bank and Canara Bank, more than 25% each. Overall, 13 state-owned banks and six private banks have risen at least 10% and as much as 44% in past one month.Clearly, the market is factoring in two thingsin the new regime, interest rate will fall and the pressure on the banks to clean up their balance sheets will be diluted. And, of course, the government will continue to infuse capital in the state-owned banks without any conditions even as the brainstorming on bank consolidation to create a few large banks will continue for years without any solution in sight.

-0.34,"New Delhi: Power minister Piyush Goyal said on Thursday he was working on a proposal to revive stalled hydropower projects to enable them to sell power at a competitive tariff.
				   
				Addressing industry executives at The Verdict, the Mint-CNBC-TV18 conference on Budget 2017 in New Delhi, Goyal said his ministry will seek cabinet approval shortly on a proposal for financial re-engineering of stalled hydropower projects. He said the provision for budgetary support will be invoked as a last resort as it was vital for projects to be self sustaining.We are working on revitalizing hydropower and see if tariff can be less than Rs5 a unit. Hydropower projects in hill states have become expensive due to associated infrastructure requirements. Budgetary support may be the last resort, Goyal said, adding that the LED industry had become self sufficient and cost-competitive without government support. Former power secretary Anil Razdan, who was present on the occasion, said the 175 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity the government is targeting, requires a strong component of renewable energy storage capacity and other sources of power to balance the grid. Hydropower projects have a long gestation period of 2-10 years, he said. Many projects got stalled due to problems relating to land, finance, and promoters. Goyal said he would seek comments from all stakeholders, including NGOs, before finalizing the policy. The power ministry is keen to revive hydropower projects and attract fresh investments into this sector as it can be a valuable source of power that could balance the grid during the night and on cloudy days when solar energy supply drops.

-1.0,"Raj Dutt, a 35-year-old home furnishing retailer in Srinagar was among the many affected by the political turmoil in Kashmir. However, this did not dampen his entrepreneurial spirit and he found an innovative solutiona digital solution. 
				   
				Dutt leveraged the newly-launched sales assistant iPad app from a leading home furnishing company to create a new way of doing business. He went to his customers homes, showcasing the now digital product catalogue, helping them visualize interiors on the app itself and taking orders on the spot or bringing over the shortlisted fabric samples when needed. Now imagine doing this without the app, which would need him to carry close to 200 sample books to choose from, each weighing 10-15kg, for each home visit. In Dutts epic journey we find a true representation of the impact a thoughtfully-crafted digital solution can create in the right hands. Digital disruption in retail is often thought of as just a way of creating a new channel to sell, own or aggregate products or services via a cool app or e-commerce marketplace. But the true potential and value of digital is far more ubiquitous.For instance, geo-analytics, complemented by rich consumer data, today allows you to pinpoint exactly the right micro-markets for, say, a handset brand to launch new stores insomething that was based on experience earlier.Digital is not all about business-to-consumer (B2C). In B2B companies, lets say auto components, one of the top needs for customers quite often is transparency of order status and timely updates. Digital provides a strong way of seamlessly creating a platform where the customer can track his order from acceptance to manufacturing and from transport and delivery with pro-active intimation on potential delaysmaking his/her life much simpler. The advantages are manifold but the journey is never easy.We believe there are six key pillars for a successful digital transformation.Disruption and innovationRedefining the business model, from selling to servicing to feedback and improvement, is one of the first steps in the journey. More times than not, the consumer wont have answers you need directly (e.g. Henry Fords famous quip that if he were to ask his customers what they wanted, he would have built faster horses). Our lines of inquiry need to leverage trained specialists to tap into the discipline of ethnographic research and understand unmet or latent needs. Amazon Echo Dot or Google Home are excellent examples of creating a new needa digital assistant that is a news reader, home lighting controller, travel agent and Wikipedia rolled into one.Customer journeys re-imaginedDefining seamless and integrated consumer journeys across all touch-points is next. If technology has defined progress in the last decade, then design thinking is the flavour of the next one. Imagine someone refurnishing their home can shortlist the fabrics you like on your app while commuting, visualize the shortlisted products as upholstery or curtains on your laptop, get advice from family and friends and finally find the nearest store to touch the actual fabric and complete the purchaseall through beautifully designed screens in a few clicks.Agile development and launch Executing these ambitions requires a considered approachchoosing the right partners and technology platform, getting the data right, even finding the right product photography solution to a life-like product display, testing the digital product and planning the digital marketing right. The focus has to be on creating the MVP (minimum viable product) and then enhancing and refining it through each sprint for iterative upgrades.Creating data and analyst capability Data is the new oil, it is said, and the key here is unlocking consumer data at the front end and operations data at the back end. It is possible today to target a person, who searched for a car, with an auto-insurance offer that is customized for him depending on his profile (demographics, interests) at another website that he frequents. Every penny of yours can be optimized to target the right person in the right geography at the right time and the right place to personalize the right offering and maximize the return on investment.Adoption and commercializationEach digital investment should have a clear lens on commercial value, tracked actively through a sharply-defined dashboard. Adoption is among the toughest challenges in the journeyespecially, converting a users interest to not only, say, a potential download, but actual usage, transaction and, most important (but most difficult), repeat engagementwhile at the same time, doing so at the least cost per click.Digitization of processA chain is as good as the weakest link. A sports car chassis with an 800cc engine will not create an optimum consumer experienceneither will the most-innovatively designed agile customer process with a 1990s back-end. Hence, digitizing of the core processes through a clear integrated view of the information technology (IT) architecture and associated applications and making choices around niche versus diverse platforms needs thoughtful consideration.Digital is a realityit is not a dotcom boom or bust. It is already the current way of working and organizations have a choiceto embrace itor die.Rajiv Gupta is partner and head of technology advantage practice, Bharat Mimani is project leader, and Amrita Chang is consultant at BCG India.",2017-01-16,K52MthnRAmw8bKYv3TkwHN,Digital provides a strong way of seamlessly creating a platform where the customer can track his order from acceptance to manufacturing and from transport and delivery with pro-active intimation on potential delays,both,00:45,How to unlock a brands true digital potential
-0.58,"San Francisco: Tracy Chou wrote a post on Medium in October 2013, challenging tech companies to tell the world what percentage of their software engineers were women. Surprisingly, it worked: Google, Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and others published their lopsided race and gender statistics, and Chou, then a Pinterest software engineer, became a face of the tech diversity movement. 
				   
				Pinterest positioned itself as a company working hard to hire more women as well as black and Latino workers. In 2015, the company made an unprecedented move: it published a set of diversity-focused hiring goals. It would strive to make 30% of its engineering hires women, and it would report on its progress in a year.Sixteen months later, Pinterest retreated. Despite all its efforts, only 22% of its new engineers were women, and in response, the company lowered its goal for next year from 30% to 25%. It had hit and exceeded its targets in two other categoriesmaking 8% of its engineering hires under-represented ethnic minorities, for example. Pinterest said it missed its women in engineering goal because it focused on hiring more senior women, which takes longer. But its admission that it had missed its mark and would lower expectations was a disappointment. Obviously we were all hoping it would be better and closer to 30%, said Chou, who left the company in June. Pinterests head of diversity, Candice Morgan, said the company sets goals that are challenging and that it thinks it has a 70% chance of reaching.ALSO READ | Why India needs more working womenPinterests big goaland its later retrenchmentshow how tech companies diversity ambitions can come with their own set of messes and challenges. In the two years since tech giants first revealed how most of their employees were white and Asian men, their diversity has only increased a few percentage points  or, in some cases, dropped. Most companies first response was to try to make their hiring processes more blind: stripping resumes of names and pictures, for example, to keep out information that might unintentionally bias an interviewer for or against a candidate.Now, some companies want to do more than cover their eyes. Its not enough to just publish demographic data and scrub names and pictures from resumes. Unlike other companies, Twitter and Pinterest set specific hiring goals. Facebook rewarded its recruiters extra for diversity hires. Microsoft is tying managers bonuses to their diversity hiring after the proportion of female workers fell for two consecutive years. Even small startups  like Penny, a four-person personal finance company in San Francisco thats the subject of the latest episode of Bloombergs Decrypted podcast  are evaluating candidates on whether they bring a new perspective to the team, in addition to their technical skills. Some companies are embracing affirmative action hiring, even if they are careful to call it something else.I have quite a few clients saying, We want to take it one step further, or saying, Listen, we did the unconscious bias thing, and we didnt get a lot out of it, said Y-Vonne Hutchinson, a diversity consultant who works with startups and helped found Project Include, a group of diversity advocates who publish guides of best practices for companies. Its happening in a way that wasnt happening last year.Hutchinson encourages companies to explore new tactics, but she also warns them to prepare for resistance. Affirmative action gets a lot of blowback, but it was one of the most successful ways of getting people from under-represented groups into jobs and institutions they were excluded from, Hutchinson said. Shes African-American, and she said affirmative action helped her mother get a federal government job. I dont think tech has embraced affirmative action because theyre really married to the idea of a meritocracy.ALSO READ | The HR trends of 2017Instead of calling it affirmative action, companies are looking for a policy that looks like that, talks like that, but isnt perceived as that, Hutchinson said. Companies want to discuss equal opportunity without the terms quotas and affirmative action, she said.Should tech companies ignore a candidates background when deciding whether to hire themor should they factor it in? The debate is ongoing, said Chou, who is also part of Project Include. (She said she left Pinterest not out of disappointment, but because she wanted to try something new.)Itd be cleaner and easier if making the hiring process blind suddenly led to more women and minorities being hired, but thats often insufficient, Chou said. Active policies to promote diversity, on the other hand, can strike some job candidates as unjust. People feel its an unfair judgment on them if they get turned down and someone they feel is objectively less than them in some way is hired, she said.At Pinterest, the pressure of reporting public hiring goals could be felt inside the company. That internal conversationWere not going to hit this, and its going to look really bad if we dontmade people haul ass and get their shit together, Chou said. Morgan, Pinterests head of diversity, wrote in an email: Setting public goals focused and encouraged the team to have more authentic conversations and learn more about how to make meaningful progress ... Theyve resulted in the most diverse team Pinterest has had to date.Pinterest asked some of its employees to recommend a certain number of candidates from under-represented groups for jobs at Pinterest, and some workers felt those goals were unfairly distributed, Chou said. Some employees pushed back when they were encouraged to refer the same number of people as a larger team and asked if the referrals should be prorated, she said. It was a little frustrating to hear the grumblings but also not that surprising, as people tend to grumble about any extra work that theyre asked to do, Chou said. Morgan said the company later tailored its requests based on feedback from engineering leaders.At Facebook, recruiters in 2015 were told to prioritize finding diversity candidatesengineers that werent white or Asian men, according to former recruiters who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to talk about their work. After a few months, the recruiters became frustrated, because they said most of their minority engineering candidates didnt end up getting an offer. From 2015 to 2016, the number of women in technology roles at Facebook increased 1 %, and its proportion of black and Latino workers stayed flat. Two former recruiters blamed the engineering departments hiring process, which gave veto power to a small group of engineering leaders that signed off on every offer. Though Facebook pushed recruiters to look for diversity, those making hiring decisions were not held accountable to those same goals, according to the former recruiters.Even when the hires are made, other employees may grow resentful. GitHub, a site where coders can store and share their work, hired consultant Nicole Sanchez in 2015 to create and lead its Social Impact team, which focuses on improving diversity efforts. The team is now 11 out of the companys 600 employees, and it pushed strongly for more diversity among the people who interviewed job seekers, the company said.Some employees groused. Two former GitHub employees said the Social Impact team would question hiring practices and choices and ruled with a heavy hand. The former employees, who declined to be identified out of fear of reprisal from the company, also alleged that GitHub sometimes missed out on the best talent by focusing too much on a candidates background. A GitHub spokeswoman declined to comment.When tech companies talk about hiring, they often talk about bringing in the best person possible and ignoring everything else. For many, best has meant the person whos most technically skilled or who will be shipping code the soonest after they start.But some are redefining best to factor in diversity. At Penny, which builds a chatbot that texts users analysis and advice about their spending, chief executive officer (CEO) Mitchell Lee wanted the companys fifth hire to add diversity to the team. He spent the fall looking for candidates who were different from the four men who already worked there  affirmative action hiring, in his own words.ALSO READ: Snapchat picks London for its international headquartersWhen I say affirmative action, I mean I want to be able to see someones picture, Lee said. If asked to choose between two hypothetical candidates who are equally qualified for a job at Penny, then he rejects the premise as false: Those two people are not equally qualified. Somebody with a diverse background and a totally different perspective is more qualified for the position were trying to fill, which is expanding upon the collective viewpoint of what Penny has, he said.Lee found that some candidates were dropping out of the interview process along the way, and they were often those he was particularly interested in  women or people with unusual backgrounds. He started checking in with those candidates more frequently, encouraging them along the way. It helped. But he said it showed him how much more was needed beyond getting diverse candidates in the mix: He needed to earn the trust of many of them. Its really hard to convey, especially if youre like me and youre a white guy in his mid-twenties trying to tell candidates that diversity is something you care about, he said.In December, after several months of searchingLee estimates he looked through hundreds of candidatesPenny hired a fifth person, Vertika Srivastava, an Indian-American woman who went to the University of Michigan and worked as a software developer at Accenture. The four current employees are excited for her to start. But Lee and the other Penny workersthey all had a saywaffled when deciding whether to give her an offer. Pennys developers code mostly in Ruby, a programming language Srivastava doesnt have much experience in.At one point during the interview process, Srivastava asked the four Penny guys why they were interested in her. They listed some aspects of her personality, and they were blunt: It was also because shes a woman. I liked that they didnt tiptoe around that, she said. She starts this week.Pennys approach is different than that of most companies. Pinterest and Twitter dont talk about quotas; they talk about hiring goals. Stacy Brown-Philpot, the African-American CEO of TaskRabbit, an on-demand job platform, has pledged to make the companys workforce represent the ethnic and racial makeup of the country. She said on stage at a conference in October that in order to get there, the company will need to over-index on certain groups, though she followed that up with: I dont know if I would say its affirmative action.Slack, a $3.8 billion workplace chat service startup, practices intentional hiring, said Leslie Miley, its director of engineering and a diversity advocate. The company actively looks for people outside of the standard 20 schools and six companies, he said, and they value what historically hasnt been valued in Silicon Valley. That means measuring people by distance travelledhow far theyve come in life instead of just looking for a Stanford computer science degree. Miley said that candidates who would score higher on this metric could include those who were the first in their family to go to college, or are veterans, or went to community college.But Miley dislikes the term affirmative action. The amount of baggage attached to that term is horrid, he said. When you say affirmative action, the very next question most people have is, Are we going to lower the bar? So lets not call it that. Lets call it hiring the way hiring always should have been. What I want is a level playing field. Bloomberg",2017-01-10,KBcVjMqer3e46kpPzpRv6I,"Maintaining diversity among employees, yet hiring the best is the next challenge facing the Silicon Valley employers",both,19:39,Some tech companies are trying affirmative action hiring

				Take steel. The governments decision to throw a protective ring around domestic steel firms worked. The minimum import price continued all through the June quarter and has been extended. In addition, anti-dumping duties and quality standards for steel (applicable to imports, too) further stemmed imports. While these steps helped, globally, steel product prices rose, including in China. A ramp-up in domestic steel capacity, better efficiency and lower input costs were also seen during the quarter.Companies such as Tata Steel Ltd and JSW Steel Ltd reported a significant jump in operating profits, chiefly due to an increase in domestic realizations. However, Tata Steels European business, too, did much better than expected. Thus, JSW reported an 84.7% increase in operating profit, while Tata Steels operating profit rose by 20.8%.In the non-ferrous space, lower zinc output affected Hindustan Zinc Ltds results, although zinc prices rose sequentially by 14.2%. The firm expects output to recover in the second half of FY17. Aluminium prices and copper prices did not improve as much as zinc did. Hindalco Industries Ltd managed a significant improvement of 64% in its operating profit over a year ago, mainly because of lower input costs and stabilization of its new aluminium operations.International seaborne iron-ore prices held on to the gains they saw early in the quarter, although they have been volatile due to pressure on China to cut its steel output, which can mean lower demand for iron ore. However, NMDC Ltds performance was affected as its domestic iron ore prices have been declining.Since the beginning of the current fiscal, the S&P BSE Metal Index has risen by much more than the Sensex. Investors appear to be confident that the recovery in metal prices, underway since early 2016, is set to continue.The near to medium term risks to watch for are mainly whether Chinas demand for metals will sustain as its government continues to provide stimulus to growth, and whether developed economies continue with their easy money policy.",2016-10-09,KBiddh7FEye8SmitgpmnsJ,"The risks to watch for are mainly whether Chinas demand for metals will sustain , and whether developed economies continue with their easy money policy",competitor,23:12,Metals: the rising tide of prices
-0.65,"There seems to be a bright rainbow over Escorts Ltd, after the rains. From June, when it was certain the monsoon was on track, until now, the agri-machinery manufacturers stock skyrocketed 123% in just three months.
				   
				Many factors came together to fuel investor confidence, which continues in the companys favour. At the forefront is the strong recovery in tractor sales on the back of a normal monsoon after two successive failed years. From April to August, tractor sales jumped by 17.5% year-on-year, with August sales alone soaring 55%.And this momentum is likely to remain through this fiscal year as the company expands its presence in the southern markets, which have steadily bucked the slowdown and outperformed growth rates. Meanwhile, Escorts continues to grow in its stronghold markets in the northern and central belts.The sudden turnaround in tractor sales after several quarters of contraction is a reason for re-rating the companys stock. In fiscal year 2016,  Escortss net revenue had contracted on the back of declining tractor sales. Its valuation had so far tailed that of other farm equipment manufacturers like VST Tillers Tractors Ltd, as other divisions dragged overall performance. However, at current levels, the stocks one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple has doubled to around 16 in a span of six months. Another fillip to valuation comes from the managements decision to sell the loss-making auto products division which was bleeding and a drain on profitability for several yearswhich has signalled its intent to focus on the companys core business.But then, profit expansion is important to sustain the current valuation. Yes, besides farm equipment, Escorts is focusing on revving up revenue growth in other divisions like construction machinery and railways too. A slew of new products have been planned across these segments to improve utilization and improve profitability. However, this may take some time to start contributing to profits in a big way.A key hurdle is that the company is saddled with high costsa function of low output and high fixed expenses too. Forecasts by the management to trim raw material costs and employee costs through a voluntary retirement scheme are likely to give a leg-up to profitability. Analysts have pencilled an operating margin of about 9% by FY18twice that of FY16. The caveat, however, is that with nearly 85% of its revenue dependent on the vagaries of the monsoon, the stocks earning trajectory will be cyclical and unpredictable.

Throw in the dollars recent strength and it becomes clear why prices, which began October on a bullish note, are increasingly appearing bearish.
				   
				But against this backdrop, Opec has regained some of its lost relevance and the producer groups decision in Vienna on 2 November on restraining output could decide the future course of oil prices.The International Energy Agency has said that Opecs plan to limit production will play a key role in speeding up the rebalancing of oil markets. Without Opec intervention, the market will remain oversupplied through the first half of next year, the Paris-based agency said in its October monthly report.But challenges have emerged on several fronts since Opec announced a preliminary deal in late September to limit production to between 32.5 million barrels per day (b/d) and 33 million b/d. Opec produced 33.24 million b/d of crude in September, according to an S&P Global Platts survey.An Opec technical meeting in Vienna at the end of October, including a day of discussions with non-Opec producers, failed to yield the desired results and drove prices lower.Front-month ICE Brent futures settled at $48.30/b on 31 October and NYMEX WTI at $46.86/b, both down 5% from levels seen on 1 October.Opec had hoped to emerge this weekend with enough parameters of its freeze agreement sorted out to gain the commitment of several non-Opec producers to join in reining in output. Instead, the meeting only served to expose the divisions within Opec, affirming doubts among sceptics that the organization would be able to credibly implement the freeze plan tentatively reached in Algiers in September.And the six non-Opec producersAzerbaijan, Brazil, Oman, Russia, Kazakhstan and Mexicowhich attended the talks were left wanting, essentially telling the producer group to get its house in order before asking them to pledge adherence to a deal that does not exist.The main obstacle has been the refusal of two of Opecs biggest producersIran and Iraqto restrict their growing output, putting the onus on Saudi Arabia to shoulder the bulk of any proposed cuts.Iraq is insisting on a higher quota or an exemption from the freeze as it battles the Islamic State militant group, while Iran argues that it is entitled to produce more, having lost out while under sanctions.Iraq has also been critical of Opecs estimate of its production using secondary sources, which it says severely underestimates the countrys actual productiona point that will make it harder for Opec members to decide which base number to use when dividing up the new production levels and further complicate an already delicate situation.Iraq told Opec that its production in September averaged a record 4.775 million b/d, up 153,000 b/d from August. However, Opecs secondary sources pegged Iraqs output last month at 4.455 million b/d, a difference of 320,000 b/d with the governments figures.The demand-supply outlook appears to have deteriorated. Overall global oil demand growth continues to slow down, dropping from a five-year high of 2.5 million b/d in Q3 2015 to a four-year low of 800,000 b/d in Q3 2016 due to vanishing OECD growth and a marked deceleration in China, according to the IEA.There appears to be no let-up in supply. Opec crude output rose by 160,000 b/d to an all-time high of 33.64 million b/d in September as Iraq pumped at record rates and Libya reopened export terminals, the IEA said, adding that Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates held supply at or near historic highs, while Iran was producing close to the pre-sanction level at 3.7 million b/d.Non-Opec production was up nearly 0.5 million b/d on higher Russian and Kazakh output.US crude production appears to have bottomed out. Output fell to 8.428 million b/d in the week ended 1 July, ranging since between 8.445 million b/d and 8.597 million b/d, according to estimates by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA).The EIA last month said that US crude production should average 8.6 million b/d next year, an upward revision of 100,000 b/d from its previous forecast. In 2016, US output is expected to average 8.7 million b/d, compared with 9.4 million b/d in 2015, EIA said.While Opec takes the limelight, one cannot forget the upcoming US election, which could impact the dollar and in turn oil prices.A key factor capping oil prices in the past month or so has been the strength in the dollar index, driven by the belief that US economic conditions have become robust enough to support an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve later this year. A stronger dollar makes fuel and crude imports more expensive for holders of other currencies, putting downward pressure on oil prices.Mriganka Jaipuriyar is associate editorial director, Asia & Middle East Oil News & Analysis, S&P Global Platts.",2016-11-04,KaImG5LLSshtdzEMTtMzjP,"The refusal of Iran and Iraq to trim their growing output is the key hurdle, putting the onus on Saudi Arabia to shoulder the bulk of any proposed cuts",competitor,02:28,Oil markets look to Opec for a way out of low prices

				Investors have soured on Starbucks Corp. in recent months as the coffee chains sales have slowed and its earnings performance has failed to match lofty expectations. Shares have dropped nearly 18% in the past year.But on Thursday, Starbucks rose as high as 5% in late trading. Why the change of heart? It certainly helped that Starbucks offered a sturdy 2017 outlook as it reported third-quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates. But the company also revealed numbers that bolstered confidence in its ability to withstand a terrible time for restaurant chains.Namely, for the first time since it changed the programme, Starbucks explained and quantifiedpretty high up in its press releasethe impact its loyalty and rewards programmem had on financial results. Declining customer traffic has been a worry for investors in the past year. But Thursdays release showed that much of the decline has been due to a quirk of the new loyalty system.Previously, Starbucks gave customers points for each transaction. Youd go to the register to buy, say, a muffin and a cappuccino and ask the cashier to ring each item up separately, to get extra points. The new loyalty program, however, rewards for total spending, not individual transactions. That change made it difficult to compare traffic and ticket amounts from one year to the nextthe changes have inflated average ticket totals and deflated traffic numbers. On Thursday, Starbucks said that, in the third quarter, adjusting for the loyalty programme changes shifted traffic from negative 1% to positive 1% growth from a year earlier.Cutting register transactions by 10% from a year earlier, helped by eliminating those duplicate orders along with mobile ordering, also helped boost employee productivity and cut costs.The disclosure doesnt change the fact that sales are slowing, but same-store sales stabilized from the quarter before. And while the comparisons will continue to be murky over the next two quarters, they will get easier once Starbucks laps the loyalty programme changes.Starbucks certainly has some more work to do, particularly in terms of getting its new loyalty programme right, ramping up its food offerings and dealing with rising labour costs. Its not immune to falling food prices and other sector-wide problems afflicting the industry. But the latest quarter shows Starbucks has found its footing again.And, as Ive argued here and here, its rewards change could ultimately boost growth, as will its plans to offer more food and build more than 2,000 stores next year across China and other parts of the world. Plus, the stocks valuation has come down to more appetizing levels: Shares now trade at 24 times forward earnings, versus an average multiple over the past two years of 28 times forward earnings. Maybe Starbucks will be more palatable to investors now.

				The move is part of Indias plan to enhance the use of natural gas in its energy mix and to increase trade with Russia, for which an international North-South transport corridor is also under implementation.The companies will examine whether the pipeline between the countries could pass through either China or through the Commonwealth of Independent States (former Soviet republics), said a government official, who asked not to be named. Gazprom owns the worlds largest gas transmission system with a total length of 171,200km.The statement said the governments also signed two other deals in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Goa, where the 17th India-Russia Annual Summit took place on Saturday.Cooperation between the countries in the area of civil nuclear cooperation, sourcing of liquefied natural gas (LNG), partnership in the oil and gas sector and engagement in renewables can construct a promising energy bridge between our two countries, the statement said, quoting Prime Minister Modi.The other two deals signed by oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan and Russias energy minister Alexander Novak on Saturday are for cooperation in the energy sector for 2017-18 and for cooperation in the area of education and training between ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corp. and Rosneft Oil Company PJSC.Both the countries agreed to further work towards boosting bilateral engagement in the hydrocarbon sector.In the last four months alone, in a clear expression of our strong and deep engagement in the Hydrocarbon sector, Indian companies have invested close to $5.5 billion in Russias oil and gas sector and, with President Putins support, we are ready and willing to expand the scope of our engagement further.

				Back home, too, the Indian Meteorological Departments (IMDs) initial monsoon estimate is forecasting good rainfall.A more detailed region-wise estimate will follow later but for now, one should assume good rains may result in higher tea output.Investors should be keeping an eye on these developments as they assess the prospects for tea companies.The higher tea output in the worlds major tea producing countries is a red flag for tea prices. In Kenya, the first two months of 2016 have seen tea output rise by 43% over the same months a year ago, according to data from Africa Tea Brokers Ltd. But thats also due to a low base effect as dry weather had affected output in 2015. If we change the base to 2014, the current years output is still higher by 19.8%. If rainfall continues to favour tea output in the next few months, then we are likely to see a substantial increase in Kenyas output in 2016.Indias tea season in North India will pick up pace later; in 2015, the high months for tea production were between May and November. Tea trading company Van Rees said in its latest weekly report that heavy pre-monsoon showers and a favourable winter in the North have led to higher crop levels this year. In its round-up, it says it expects plenty of tea in the near future. Indias North India plantations accounted for four-fifths of tea output, according to the Tea Board of Indias data, with South India bringing up the rest. Abundant tea output globally could signal weak trends in auction prices. Whether prices trend weak and by how much is an important factor determining the performance of companies. Costs are another factor. Last year, tea company McLeod Russel India Ltd had said it expects costs to increase by 13% due to higher input costs and wages. In the current year, it expects costs to increase by 7%.While a lower increase in costs is indeed beneficial, a decline in tea prices could nullify that.

SpiceJet Ltd is the only aviation firm that performed better than expected. This is not to say that the airline was immune to pricing woes. But the impact on SpiceJet was less than expected, with its fares declining 3% year-on-year. In comparison, InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, which runs IndiGo, saw an 11% decline in average fare.
				   
				The SpiceJet stock had underperformed the benchmark Sensex since IndiGo announced results till 6 September. However, the trend changed on 7 September when SpiceJets results pleased investors, leading to a 16% jump in the stock that day.Jet Airways (India) Ltd had a bumpy landing in the June quarter. Jet said in its conference call that its drop in domestic average fare was close to 10% whereas on the global front the drop in average fare was to the tune of 2.5%. Factoring in higher-than-expected drop in yields and inching up in cost, Edelweiss Securities Ltd revised down Jets FY17/FY18 earnings per share (EPS) 25%/14%, respectively. Kotak Institutional Equities cut its IndiGo FY17-9 EPS estimates by 11-25% to account for near-term pressure on margins due to declining yield.On the revenue front, SpiceJets performance was the best, with revenue increasing 37% year-on-year, led by a combination of increase in capacity, robust load factor and 64% growth in ancillary revenue. IndiGos revenue rose 9%, driven by a combination of higher volume and a decline in average fares. Jets stand-alone revenue performance was the most disappointing with revenue declining 2% compared with last year.

				ICICI Prudential, the countrys only listed insurer, said that its net premium income grew 2.9% from a year ago to Rs5,698 crore for the three months ended 31 December. This was aided by a 46.7% rise in first year premium to Rs1,780 crore.However, the companys management expenses for the December quarter increased by around 19.2% year-on-year to Rs754.61 crore primarily due to an increase in employees remuneration and a 34% jump in net commission paid. The company said in a release that the increase in commission expense is broadly in line with the product mix and increase in premium.The expenses increased mainly due to the increase in our new businesses. From a ratio angle The expenses are more or less in line with our topline growth, said Sandeep Batra, executive director, ICICI Prudential Life.The company also posted an investment loss of Rs665.19 crore in the December quarter compared to a net income of Rs1,656 crore a year ago. This was primarily due to losses incurred on investments made under linked life insurance policies (Rs837.1 crore) and linked pension policies. This is not really a loss but it is a part of the linked business whose net asset values (NAVs) keep fluctuating. The fluctuation essentially needs to be moved both at the topline which shows as part of the investment income as well as consequential changes in actuarial results relating to the linked business. The two will net off each other. So this is essentially the marked to market value of the equity movement on the linked side, Batra added.In the quarters ahead, ICICI Prudential will continue to focus on protection business as it believes that there still exists a significant need for protection in India, Batra said, adding that customers are still choosing the linked category of policies the most.At the end of December, the companys solvency ratio was at 294%, down from 306% at September end and 319% at the end of December 2015. Regulations require an insurer to maintain a solvency ratio of 150% at all times.

1.0,"Tokyo:  Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs at least $100 billion more to finance countrys goals for clean energy even after his governments policies brought in record investment in wind and solar power stations.
				   
				Thats the conclusion of a report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, which found $10.5 billion flew into renewables in India for the fiscal year ended 31 March, almost 60% more than the $6.6 billion invested two years ago. It also said 7.3 gigawatts of clean-energy projects were built for the latest fiscal year, which is 71% higher than the previous period.The findings represent the broadest assessment yet of the money going into Indias clean-energy industry. Growth in the renewables business has helped India become the third-biggest power market in the world after China and the US, according to the BNEF report. Modi has set a goal of building 175 gigawatts of clean-energy capacity by 2022 to supply more of the 62 million households that lack access to reliable grids and feed demand for electricity thats projected to rise fourfold by 2040.Hes taking the right steps, but the targets are quite ambitious, said Shantanu Jaiswal, the lead author of the report at BNEF. The question is where do people get the money$100 billion is a lot of money for this industry, especially given where were starting from.An investment of $100 billion is equivalent to almost 5% of all the goods and services produced annually by the nation of 1.3 billion people, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Diversified financingThe report, sponsored by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, a US non-profit working to mitigate climate change with renewable energy, was released at BNEFs conference in Shanghai on Tuesday. It also found that India has installed clean-energy capacity of 42.6 gigawatts. That accounts for 14% of the nations total generation capacity, up from 12.5% three years ago.Jaiswal said the nation needs to diversify its sources of finances to reach the goal, bringing in big international banks to complement the lending done by Indias state-backed institutions and the development banks active in the country. It also needs to reduce the cost of debt financing for solar projects, which is more than double the rate charged in China and six times interest rates available in Japan, according to the report.State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank, along with Axis Bank Ltd and Yes Bank Ltd, have helped supply much of the finance along with non-bank lenders such as Tata Cleantech Capital Ltd and L&T Finance Ltd. Development institutions include the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency, the World Banks International Finance Corp., the Asian Development Bank and KFW of Germany.The huge capital needed to meet the targets, as well as the high cost of capital, mean that fundraising from the public markets will be critically important, according to the report. Along with green bonds, India is turning to infrastructure investment trusts, which are used to free up and recycle developers capital stuck in operational projects by securitizing the revenue streams and offering the units on the public market.The arrangement, expected to help the inflow of foreign capital and reduce the exposure of domestic financial institutions, was approved in September 2014 by the Securities and Exchange Board of India. Infrastructure investment trusts are similar to yieldcos in helping developers combine multiple projects.To create safeguards for investors in infrastructure investment trusts, regulators have set a requirement for a minimum number of independent directors in the investment management firm and have also placed restrictions on transactions done between related parties, according to the report.India also needs to improve on the management of power distribution companies, according to BNEFs Jaiswal.Right now, Indias power distribution utilities are in huge debts, so they dont buy power even when theres demand, Jaiswal said.Retailers held total debt of almost Rs.4.1 trillion ($60 billion) at the end of March 2015, Power Minister Piyush Goyal said in August.

-0.54,"In the March quarter, Punjab National Bank (PNB) earned notoriety by reporting the largest quarterly loss by any Indian lender. Since then, the public sector bank has swung back into profit and showed a net profit of Rs549 crore in the September quarter.
				   
				The 11% drop in profit for  PNB was largely expected by most analysts and some had even expected a loss in the second quarter. So was the muted growth in advances, and a fall in net interest income.The state-owned banks historic loss of Rs5,370 crore in the March quarter was on the back of a phenomenal rise in bad loans and provisions for the same. The quarters that followed havent been merciful. In the September quarter too, gross non-performing assets continued to stay above 13% and the stressed asset ratio remained a massive 18%.Write-downs have escalated indicating that the lenders war room in bad loans is not getting much luck in resolution.But there is a silver lining, in fact several of them.Firstly, the banks fresh slippages have reduced to Rs5,089 crore in the September quarter from Rs7,533 crore in the previous quarter. Its cash recoveries have risen and so have upgrades. PNB has consciously shrunk its exposure to large companies, especially infrastructure. All this shows the banks war-room executives have not been twiddling their thumbs.But much of this is perhaps factored in by the increase in the banks stock price over the last three months.

-0.44,"Bengaluru: Back in 2008, 25-year-old Rohan Murty embarked on an unusual road trip. He travelled to various US cities around the Washington, DC metro area on his own, often walking for miles from one city to another. It was far from a thrill-seeking adventurehe was a man on a mission. Murty drove more than a thousand miles through forests and in the middle of nowhere.
				   
				Using a technology system he had built at Harvard Universitywhere he was at the time pursuing his PhD in computer scienceMurty was attempting to measure the actual usage of licensed and unlicensed spectrumwhich is typically used by telecom companies, TV and radio stations, as well as for technology such as Wi-Fi. He stopped every few miles, in order to validate the correctness of his research and the software he had built. What he found out during that study would lay the basis for his research into technology that is referred to as White Space Network or White-Fi. In laymans terms, White-Fi refers to unutilized television broadcast frequencies or white spaces that are potentially capable of delivering low-cost Internet connectivity to rural and remote parts of a country. What I found out during that trip was that spectrum in general is severely underutilized, says Murty. Murty jokingly recalls that at one point, he was even stopped by a state police officer, who wondered why some scrawny, brown kid was walking around suspiciously with an unusual technical device on a US highway. A vocal proponent of White-Fiwhich he believes has the potential to deliver affordable Internet connectivity to hundreds of millions of Indians across the remotest parts of the countryMurty is of the view that the Indian government needs to make a stronger push for White-Fi and does not agree with the current stand of top telcos such as Airtel and Vodafone, which have so far opposed the use of white spaces. Companies like Microsoft have also in recent months urged the government to fight for White-Fi and oppose the telecom lobby, citing the examples of countries like the US and UK where unlicensed spectrum usage has been permitted. In an interview, Murty, son of Infosys Ltd founder N.R. Narayana Murthy and a junior fellow at the Society of Fellows at Harvard University, spoke primarily on his research on White-Fi, how his work focused on architecture for dynamic spectrum access in wireless networks and other work that he is doing on the sidelines. Aside from helping manage investments for the Murthy family office, Catamaran Ventures, he has also made some angel investments under the radarincluding a small investment in Bengaluru-based start-up Floh, which is a singles network that helps urban and educated singles find life partners. Edited excerpts:What do you make of current debates around spectrum usage in India? The telcos have so far fiercely opposed the use of white spaces and unlicensed spectrum...Let me zoom back a little. Historically weve always thought of spectrum as a binary sort of thingeither somebody has exclusive access to it or nobody has exclusive access to it. So, its either licensed or unlicensed. Example of licensed, is TV, radio, cellphone companies, etc. Wi-Fi is an example of unlicensed spectrum, its the technology that Wi-Fi operates overthats one example. Wi-Fi is just a piece of technology though, not a piece of spectrum. Now, lets take an examplelets say you have a wire between your computer and the Internet. And you pump data through. Think of the wire as a pipe and data as water. The more volume of water you pump, the more data you are pumping through. But there is a limit before the pipe explodes, in some sense. So, what do you do when the pipe saturates? All you have to do is instal one more pipeor in this case, one more wire. So, in some sense you can have infinite bandwidthbecause you just keep installing more wires. And that works. But when you move to the wireless world, this is not the right analogy. The wireless world is like a highwaythe width is fixed, you cant increase the width at all. That is a limitation of nature. So, the capacity of a wireless world is boundthere is a maximum you can extract out of it. So, now you have these lanes on the highwaywhen you licence some part of the spectrum to someone, you basically say hey, this lane is yours. Nobody else can touch it. And then there is another lane which is for the public and they use Wi-Fi for it. Now, what happens is that more and more cars are getting into this lane and there is only one lane. And we start saturating this lane. What do we do? We look across at the licensed lane, which is registered to someone and we see that nobody is using it frequently and its just sitting there. But the law states that you can only use this one lane. And all this while more and more cars are coming and we feel there is scarcity. But the truth is that this is artificial scarcity. So, the work I ended up doing was to see if those unused lanes could be used without interfering with someone elses licensed lane and on how to detect the presence of others in that lane. When I detect youre coming, then I just get out and go back in the other lane. India seems to be lagging countries such as the US and the UK in terms of embracing the opportunity hereAbsolutely. India is behind in terms of thinking of new forms of spectrum usage. I do believe that is the case. If you go talk to the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) in the US and Ofcom in the UK, just look at some of the progressive things these guys are doing. In India, weve seen companies like Google and Facebook attempt moon shots with permission from the government and provide Internet access through balloon projects such as Loon to remote parts of the country. But weve surprisingly seen opposition on White-Fi. What does the government and the telecom lobby need to do on this matter? Is there a general lack of understanding of how this technology can benefit the masses? There is no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem. I dont think the answer is that telcos will solve everything. If they claim that, I dont agree with that. I dont think balloons will solve everything either. All these different technologies will play a role and theyll fit different needs. I think it will fulfil an important need. You cannot solve everything (with just White-Fi) as well. Lets assume that spectrum operated by Wi-Fi was operated by a telcoalmost certainly it wouldnt have taken off. Every time you would have turned your Wi-Fi modem on, you would pay the telco money. Today you dont pay anybody anything. So, I dont agree with the view that telcos will solve every problem. What is the potential of White-Fi in terms of connecting millions to affordable Internet? If spectrum is a good owned by the people, then the right thing is you want to raise revenue from it and at the same time want to maximize the usage of spectrum. Lets assume that you raise revenue from it and the spectrum is actually not being used. Then you have a losing proposition... I dont know if (White-Fi) can solve all (connectivity) problems, but it can certainly have a positive impact and become one of the many technologies that helps. And fundamentally, in my mind, it alters the way we think about spectrum. These are important policy decisions which will alter peoples lives down the line. I do admire the US on thistheyve been much more open-minded on this. I think there is a case to be made here as well. I think it is inevitable that there will be an increasing wave of opportunism in terms of spectrum use. Its like what Andy Grove said once: if you have a great piece of technology, you can send lawyers and bureaucrats to delay it. Ultimately the technology goes around it. Can you talk about some of your work in this area? Aside from my thesis on this subject, I even have a follow-on paper that was published. Its all there in my thesisits called SATYA, which was an algorithm, a system that we built with one of my professors at Harvard, where we showed that even on top of this, you can actually raise revenues. We showed how it lowers the barrier for access to spectrum, while also increasing overall revenues. This will be an inevitable part of our futureand thats what my work shows, what are some of these challenges and how do we overcome them. And how it will fundamentally alter our view on how spectrum is used.So, what are some of the challenges facing India?In this country and every country, our issue is about how do you connect more and more people to the Internet. There are a couple of different ways in which it can happen. One, you assume there is a fibre to every home. But we both know thats prohibitively expensive to build and to maintain. Its not easy. Second, everything will be through wireless, such as 4G. I think thatll work to a certain extent, but as we have seen in other countries such as the UK and the US, if you try to wire up large portions of the country where you dont have purchasing power, then the economic argument is not justified. In my mind, Ive always felt there is some other way to connect these people. I think there is room to wire up large parts of the country with some sort of semi-unlicensed spectrum. So, are we talking about the need for a wide-scale policy overhaul in India on this matter?Absolutely. Separately, how do you view Reliance Jios entry and the current price wars that are brewing between telcos?Im a fan of anything where the consumer wins. If I can get 4G everywhere at a reasonable price, Im happy.",2016-12-10,MZp7mAMVUiI5Nm8jZaqvwK,"The founder of Murty Classical Library on his research on White-Fi, or white space network, and the focus on architecture for dynamic spectrum access in wireless networks",competitor,01:48,Spectrum in general is underutilized: Rohan Murty

-1.0,"New Delhi: With its eyes set on doubling Indias present installed wind power by 2022, the ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE) has revised guidelines for onshore wind power projects. 
				   
				At present (till end-September), India has 28.1 giga watt (GW) of wind power installed capacity across the country and the Central government has set an ambitious target of generating 60GW by 2022. To achieve that target, MNRE believes that the current rate of deployment of wind power capacity is required to be more than doubled. The guidelines were revised to address new-age problems and reduce delays.India first came out with guidelines for development of onshore wind power projects in 1995 to ensure proper growth of the wind power sector. The guidelines were then revised in 1996. Since then, this is the first major revision.The guidelines aim to facilitate development of wind power projects in an efficient, cost effective and environmentally benign manner. They address all major issues like land use permission, availability of wind resource, grid connectivity, transport logistics, environmental acceptability, micrositing, health and safety, hybridization, repowering and decommission plan.The project developer should ensure that the land being selected for the wind power project can be legally used for the purpose and all regulations regarding land use/land cover are complied with, said the guidelines which were issued on 22 October. They clarified that in case of land allotment by the state government for the wind power project, a maximum period of four years may be allowed for development and start of commissioning of the project. But if there is a delay, then the land allotment may be cancelled.To address the issue of grid connectivity, the guidelines said that the project developer should ensure that grid connectivity is technically and commercially feasible at the site selected.If the site being selected falls in the area of forest land or in the vicinity of habitat of migratory birds and their flight routes, civil aviation, defence and heritage establishments the project developer should ensure availability of necessary clearances from concerning authorities, they added.It added that to ensure health and safety of people working/residing near the wind power installations the NIWE (National Institute of Wind Energy) will prescribe criteria for noise and shadow flicker in consultation with stakeholders.The guidelines also stated that a proposal to establish wind power project should necessarily include a decommissioning plan of the wind turbine after completion of its useful life.The NIWE will formulate guidelines for decommissioning of the wind turbines in consultation with stakeholders, it added.As per the MNRE, the need for such guidelines were felt because of advancement in the wind turbine technology, requirement to comply various standards and regulations issued by CEA (Central Electricity Authority) and other regulatory bodies, to address issues related to micrositing, decommissioning, health and safety.For instance, over the past 20 years, the wind turbine technology in India has evolved from less efficient turbines with low capacity of 225 KW to more efficient turbines with high capacity of 3 mega watt being manufactured in India.Indias total installed renewable capacity currently is around 44.2GW and significance of wind power in India can be assumed from the fact it amounts to over 60% of the total installed renewable power.

-0.07,"Wipro Ltd has underperformed peers for so long that expectations from it typically run low. It was no different with the companys March quarter results announcement; analysts were expecting organic growth of only around 1% compared with the December quarter.
				   
				But Wipro fell short of even these low expectations. Its revenues were flat after adjusting for the impact of two acquisitions it closed during the March quarter. Worse still, it has guided for between 1% and 3% growth for the June quarter, even though the full contribution of the HealthPlan Services acquisition will add about two percentage points to growth. At the mid-point of its guidance, therefore, organic growth is again expected to be flat.While Wipro has taken various steps to stem the decline in its growth rate, the fruit of these actions is still not visible. Apart from the troubles in the energy and utilities industry, which contributes to 15% of total revenue, the company is also grappling now with challenges some of its banking and financial services clients in Continental Europe are facing. In the energy and utilities segment, Wipro said that discretionary spending will come back when there is some stability in gas prices. Meanwhile, the gap vis-à-vis industry growth rates has only widened. On a year-on-year basis, growth in organic revenue stood at merely 3.7% in the March quarter. The industry is growing at around 10% in dollar terms. Margins were below estimates, too, despite an unexpected pickup in employee utilization benefits from the rupees depreciation. The company said that margins in its India and Middle East business fell because of certain investments, whereas commensurate revenues from these initiatives are still to be recognized.The only silver lining was the companys announcement for buy-back worth Rs.2,500 crore. Of course, the promoters are likely to receive a large portion of this, in proportion to their 73% stake. Even so, the buy-back using the tender offer route is a tax-efficient way to return cash to shareholders. Along with the dividends announced for the year, Wipro has increased its payout ratio to 48% in fiscal year 2015-16. In FY15, it paid shareholders 41% of the years profit, and in the preceding four years, its payout was around 30% of net profit. The higher payout will result in better return ratios, and the lower cash balance could act as a hurdle against large and risky acquisitions.But the positives from the buy-back are captured in the companys shares, which have risen by nearly 10% in the past five trading sessions.

0.55,"Mumbai: If the much-hyped Unified Payments Interface (UPI) of the National Payments Corp. of India is not working as well as it should, blame the large banks.
				   
				Thats the surmise of the Economic Survey 2017 which studied a huge volume of transactions of the so-called Aadhar-enable payment system and discovered that transactions between customers of different banks failed much more often than those between customers of the same bank. The so-called decline rate (failure rate) was 56% in the case of the former, almost double that of the failure rate in the latter. Aaadhar enabled payment system is a bank led model which allows online interoperable transactions at micro ATMs through the business correspondent of any bank using the Aadhaar authentication.One plausible hypothesis for this differential is that the larger banks are declining transactions involving smaller remitting banks while ensuring that transactions involving themselves are honoured, the survey said. The survey warned that as more entities join the UPI, banks should facilitate interoperability instead of thwarting it. But such problems will need to be addressed, since payments banks, telecommunications companies, and small banks are in the vanguard of financial inclusion. So their access to the UPI platform will be critical for advancing digitalization, especially for the poor, the survey said.The Economic Surveys comment is telling.Digital wallet companies raised concerns about banks blocking transactions to protect their turf. Recently, ICICI Bank blocked transactions on payments app PhonePe, citing security issues and violation of UPI guidelines on inter-operability. State Bank of India also blocked net banking transactions with e-wallet companies, although it allowed customers to top their mobile wallets with debit and credit cards. Principally we have favoured interoperability not just among banks but also among banks and non-banks. The proportion of cash transactions still continue to be high. There is therefore a need to take a long term view for the industry. Anything that comes in the way of being interoperable is not good, said Naveen Surya of the Payments Council of India, a lobby group of digital wallet companies. Ever since the government decision to ban Rs500 and Rs1,000 currency notes on 8 November, it has tried to promote cashless transactions. The biggest beneficiaries of this move have been digital payment firms and wallet operators. According to the latest RBI data, the volume of UPI transactions in January was 3.9 million as against 2 million in December. Value of UPI transactions more than doubled to Rs 15.1 billion during the period Interoperability is an equally important tenet across payment system. This is something that is agreed to by all. We believe that if an entity does not follow the interoperability regime, then we have all our rights to stop that and give them time to become interoperable. If they become inter-operable they will form a part of various collaberations that we have operating with others.

				Bloombergs consensus on the price-to-earnings multiple forecast for FY17 has risen several notches since April on the back of rising earnings estimates. But this is not alarming, given the host of positive developments in the company over the last few months.The management decision pencilled several quarters ago to gradually exit non-core businesses has started unfolding. Last week, it said that it plans to sell about 15% in its subsidiary, L&T Technology Services Ltd. This comes close on the heels of the success of L&T Infotech Ltds initial public offering, another unit where the parent sold about 10%.Indeed, these may be a drop in the ocean; considering the huge cash-flow requirement for its engineering and construction business, it has set the wheel of value-unlocking rolling.That is not all. The company intends to sell some operational road assets, power and ports, which are losing money.A Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd report dated 14th July, echoes the same sentiment, saying, these businesses together total losses of about Rs.1,000 crore, which, once sold, will add at least 2% to its return on equity.But then, selling loss-making businesses is not a cakewalk and could take time.There is a leap of faith on the Street. Investors seem to be buying into the management vision that cash flows from better operations and exit from non-core businesses should significantly reduce working capital from current levels. Note that net working capital had shot up from about 17% of sales to 24% in just three years, due to delays in project execution, customer payments, vendor support and so on. The economic revival should also alleviate these problems over the next 12-24 months.That said, there are concerns still on order inflows and margin trajectory. Order inflows for FY16 shocked the Street, declining 12% from a year ago, unable to meet the managements watered down forecast of flat order inflows. This fiscal, they are likely to grow by 15%. However, a report by Religare Capital Markets Ltd points out that order inflows are likely to be flat over FY15 levels, highlighting the plateauing of order inflows, given the high base and a weak investment cycle. Analysts are also apprehensive that a shift to Indian Accounting Standards norms can hurt margins.The macroeconomic clouds are clearing up, what with rising oil prices, a normal monsoon, along with the governments push on infrastructure. This should accelerate order inflows from the Middle East region, where L&T has a presence, and on home ground, albeit a few quarters later.Until then, a firm focus on executing its existing order book, which is about thrice the current revenue, will hold it in good stead. This is one reason why investors may choose to ignore near-term challenges on project execution and margin weakness. After all, it still remains the best equity play on infrastructure.",2016-07-18,NnFWaoNCbXOhaAqhxArq4I,"Investors seem to be buying into L&T management vision that cash flows from better operations and exit from non-core businesses should reduce working capital

-0.44,"Bengaluru: Ride-hailing service Ola (ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd) has appointed former SAB Miller India executive Shalabh Seth as the chief executive of its leasing subsidiary Ola Fleet Technologies Pvt. Ltd to help grow the supply of cars, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.
				   
				I am very excited about Shalabh joining us to lead the leasing business, which is a key strategic priority for us. Shalabh brings in valuable experience in managing a large and complex business and we believe he is rightly equipped to take Olas leasing business to the next level and I look forward to working with him, said Bhavish Aggarwal, co-founder and chief executive at Ola, in a statement.An alumnus of Birla Institute of Technology, Pilani, and INSEAD, Seth worked with ITC Ltd between 1993 and June 2001 before joining SAB Miller India, where he played different roles such as director of supply chain, director of sales and managing director.Ola launched the cab-leasing programme in September 2015. Ola had then said that it, along with financing partners and carmakers, will invest Rs5,000 crore towards this cab-leasing programme over the coming year.Ola bet that the leasing programme will help bring in thousands of new cars on its platform and gain an edge over Uber. The company had partnered with Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Nissan Motor India at the launch. Earlier this month, Ola struck a deal with automaker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd to finance vehicles for more than 40,000 of its drivers by 2018. The alliance is worth Rs2,600 crore.In September 2015, the company appointed Rahul Maroli, a former LeasePlan Corp. NV executive, to build the leasing business.It is important for Ola to grow the leasing programme quickly because the supply of cabs has stagnated since late last year after a two-year surge when the attraction of professional independence and high earnings brought cab drivers in hordes to Ola and rival Uber India.But a slower-than-expected growth of the business has prompted Ola to make changes to its leasing business. Apart from lowering the upfront payment and forgoing commissions, Ola has also increased the lease tenure by six months to 48 months, to keep the drivers on its platform for a longer period. Ola is persuading drivers to sign up with a lower upfront payment for cabs, zero commissions and new car models, Mint reported on 21 September.While Ola has been trying to strengthen its senior leadership team, some of its key hires have resigned in the last one year. For instance, Sundeep Sahni, a former executive at e-commerce firm Lazada Indonesia who was hired as vice-president of new initiatives, and Abhimanyu Rawal, head of Olas luxury car business, quit the company since December.Earlier in 2015, Harsha Kumar, associate vice-president of products, and Rushil Goel, head of the payments business had quit.To be sure, Uber India also runs a leasing programme through its wholly-owned subsidiary Xchange Leasing India Pvt.

-0.79,"Mumbai: When the Indian government invalidated high-value banknotes on the night of 8 November, taking out 86% of the currency in circulation by value, it was supposed to be a war on unaccounted-for and untaxed wealth, counterfeit notes and terror financing.
				   
				Somewhere along the way, as serpentine queues formed outside bank branches and automated teller machines (ATMs) for days and weeks together, the slogan changed. It became all about promoting a cashless or at least a less-cash culture in an economy where almost 90% of transactions are paid for in cash.The talk turned to technologies such as mobile wallets, crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin, mobile peer-to-peer payments, block chain technology, payment banks and architectures such as the unified payment interface (UPI) and the recently-launched Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) app.The total value of all transactions done using electronic payment systems in India in December rose to Rs105 trillion from Rs95 trillion in November, according to representative data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on 17 January. They included transactions done through the real time gross settlement (RTGS) system, the national electronic funds transfer (NEFT) system, immediate payment service (IMPS), credit cards, debit cards, UPI, point of sale (PoS) terminals and mobile banking.Indeed, the growing popularity and rapid adoption of digital payment systems, in the face of a shortage of cash and stringent limits on bank withdrawals, may be a silver lining to the demonetisation of Rs500 and Rs1,000 notesan exercise that some critics have slammed as ill-conceived and hastily implemented.To be sure, India has a long way go before it joins the ranks of countries such as Sweden, Finland, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, Singapore, France and the UK where more than 85% of the consumer payment transactions are done digitally.But its a start. Consider this. A day after demonetisation, Ola Money, the digital payment solution offered by ride-hailing company Ola, reported an over 1,500% increase in recharges across the 102 cities of its operation. Oxigen Services India Pvt. Ltd, too, claimed to have broken all its previous records in money uploads and transaction count in the week after the demonetisation.Similarly, the National Payments Corporation of Indiathe umbrella organization for all retail payments systems in Indiaclaimed that in just two days (8-9 November), the use of its domestic card schemeRuPayalmost doubled to around 800,000 transactions a day, compared with a daily average of 400,000 transactions earlier (http://bit.ly/2gdu0bW).One97 Communications Ltd-owned digital payments firm Paytm said on 21 November it had seen more than seven million transactions worth Rs120 crore on that day alone. The company claimed that offline, person-to-merchant transactions had grown to contribute over 65% of transactions. Mobile wallet FreeCharge, too, said it had ramped up its acquisition effort and was targeting signing up one million merchants in the coming 12 months.On 16 January, Paytm said it has received a phenomenal response for new service categories such as hospitals, tolls and petrol pumps, and expects to add more categories in the coming months. According to the company, the new categories are generating six million transactions a month and are expected to overtake mobile recharges (in terms of order volumes) by mid-2017. Over the next few months, Paytm will expand to newer categories such as automobile service stations, school and college hostel cafeterias, dairy outlets, apartment maintenance and traffic challans. The company will convert into a payments banks over the next two months, according to a 4 January Press Trust of India report.In a bid to give the country a digital boost, NPCI said its new electronic toll collection (ETC) system would eventually include other vehicle-related payments such as parking fees, servicing and fuel charges (http://bit.ly/2fIv7xf).It was only in September that NPCI launched a pilot project for Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS) with 26 Bharat Bill Payment Operating Units (BBPOUs). Most banks now offer UPI-enabled apps on Google Play Store. To use a UPI-enabled app, you need an Android smartphone, a bank account and a registered mobile number linked to your bank account (http://bit.ly/2eiNqw1).Digital transactions began booming after e-commerce firms such as Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon, Myntra and Jabong began offering attractive discounts to woo customers. Banks accelerated the efforts with their own mobile wallets, mobile banking apps, and pitches of banking on smartwatches and even social networking sites (http://bit.ly/1fucY4s).The launch of Pockets by ICICI Bank Ltd, Lime by Axis Bank Ltd, PayZapp by HDFC Bank Ltd, SBI Buddy by State Bank of India and Ziggit by IDFC Bank Ltd are cases in point.Large telecom services providers such as Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone India Pvt. Ltd, too, have mobile payments solutionsAirtel Money and Vodafone M-Pesa, respectivelytargeted at their own customer base, largely for mobile recharges and remittances. Idea Money from Idea Cellular Ltd, and Jio-Money by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd are other telco-led payment solutions. Airtel, meanwhile, has also announced the launch of its payments bank.Banking in India is witnessing what Nandan Nilekani calls the WhatsApp moment, threatening to disrupt the banking ecosystem in India as payments move to mobile and lending to algorithms. With the launch of UPI, the country has crossed a significant milestone.Apart from making payments easier, UPI enables micro-credit. This will help the currently underserved small traders and businesses. The visibility into transactions provided by UPI apps enables financial institutions to evaluate the credit worthiness of its users. Instead of assets, credit will be based on transaction flow, and can be issued instantaneously. This will provide more choice for borrowers, especially those who depend on moneylenders and the informal sector for loans, says Venkatesh Hariharan, director of Indian Software Products Industry Round Table (iSPIRT)a think tank.Smartphones and increasing Internet penetration will only help Indias digital cause. Around 90% of all devices will be Internet-enabled by 2017, and the number of Internet users will touch 650 million by 2020 from 300 million in 2015, predicts a 25 July report by Google and Boston Consulting Group (BCG). The report forecasts the size of the digital payments industry in India to touch $500 billion by 2020, contributing 15% to Indias gross domestic product (GDP). It also predicts that the non-cash (including cheques, demand drafts, net-banking, credit/debit cards, mobile wallets and UPI) contribution in the consumer payments segment will double to 40% in the same period.Further, while around 30 billion bills worth $103 billion are generated every year, of which 70% are paid in cash, initiatives such as NPCIs BBPS may give a further impetus to the digitization of bill payments.The number of mobile wallet users is already three times the number of credit cards issued in the country (24 million in 2015-16), according to the Google-BCG report.The smartphone explosion in India is expected to usher in this new era in digital payments over the next few years, according to the Google-BCG report.India currently ranks second in the world with more than one billion mobile subscriptions. Of this, around 240 million consumers use smartphones, and this base is projected to increase to over 520 million by 2020.Smartphone subscriptions in the country will increase fourfold to 810 million by 2021, according to the India edition of the Ericsson Mobility Report released on 7 June.The Google-BCG report also highlights that micro-transactions will form a substantial portion of the industry, with more than 50% of the person-to-merchant transactions expected to be under Rs100. It predicts that the value of remittances and money transfer that will pass through alternative digital payment instruments will double to 30% by 2020. A related BCG study (http://bit.ly/2bc0gLk) in August forecasts that by 2020, about 315 million Indians living in rural areas will be connected to the Internet, compared with 120 million now.Globally, too, the payments landscape is seeing heightened activity across multiple categories, ranging from device manufacturers (Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co.), tech firms (Google, eBay Inc., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd), retailers (Starbucks Corp., Wal-Mart Stores Inc.), telecom companies (Vodafone Group Plc., Orange SA) and start-ups (Square Inc., TransferWise Ltd), according to the Google-BCG report.More disruption is expected as the number of fintech start-ups doubled to 1,000 in approximately five years, with funding growing six times to reach $11 billion in 2015.This hockey-stick growth is due to the axis shifting to the customer, who is today served by a variety of competing business models and methods driving its adoption. The explosion in mobile banking is proof enough of how private banks and, later, PSU (public sector undertaking) banks, too, got their act together and worked with start-up fintech firms to rejig their apps, sites and in-house wallets to keep up with customer expectations, rather than trying and do everything by themselves, or waiting for the regulator to issue diktats, says Probir Roy, co-founder and director of digital payments firm Paymate.Hiccups clearly exist.Indians love their cash. Paper currency facilitates making transactions anonymous, helping conceal activities from the government in a way that might help agents avoid laws, regulations and taxes. This is a big difference from most forms of electronic money that, in principle, can be traced by the government, wrote Kenneth Rogoff, Thomas D. Cabot professor of public policy and professor of economics at Harvard University, in an 11 April 2014 paper.This trend is borne out by the fact that retail payments in India, for instance, are still dominated by cash, with a mere 6-7% of transactions conducted electronically. The rest are in cash or cheque.Uber is primarily a cashless service elsewhere in the world, but more than 50% of Uber trips in India are paid for in cash, according to a 10 November blog by Forrester Inc. analyst Ashutosh Sharma.Sharma points out that in India, merchants are forcing the choice of cash payments on customers because electronic payments eat into their marginsjust like everywhere else in the world.Barriers to a cashless world, concurs the World Economic Forum (WEF), include the fact that some merchants still dont want the infrastructure costs and fees associated with electronic payments; some customers still find cash more convenient; access is an issue for individuals without bank accounts; and fraudsters continue to find opportunities in electronic transactions.Consumers who have tried using digital payments but have now shifted to other modes such as cash, card and online banking say the inconvenience of remembering log-in credentials, insufficient acceptance, possibility of a technical or human mistake during a transaction and frequently running out of balance are the top reasons for lapsing, according to the report by Google and BCG. Hence, expanding merchant acceptance is critical to driving mass adoption by consumers.As of 30 September, the number of PoS devices which accept debit and credit cards as modes of payments at merchant outlets was a mere 1.49 million, according to the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBIs) monthly bulletin. Indians had nearly 730 million debit cards and 27 million credit cards at September end, though it isnt clear, however, how many people have more than one card (http://bit.ly/2gc6sFy). Moreover, most Indians use debit cards to withdraw cash from ATMs.According to Roy, a cashless economy has to have appeal and practicality at the most elementary level for consumers and merchants alike, especially given the plethora of overlapping and competing payment options.There are great apps for mobile banking, money transfer, shop and pay, tap and go, etc., and then there are the old faithful viz. net banking, prepaid cards, IMPS and e-wallets, USSD (unstructured supplementary service data) and UPI. The latter (USSD and UPI), yet to quite reach their WhatsApp moment, saddled as it is by the way banks have implemented, and promoting them vis-a-vis other offerings, lack of a people-friendly branding and a common user interface, explains Roy.Roy cites the example of a food court in a mall where you load your food court plastic card, redeem at food stalls on par and cash out the balance when done.Security is another big concern. According to cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab, while those who have been transacting online are fairly well-versed with the threats one can face while paying online, its the first-time users or new adaptors that need to be educated on the risks they are exposed to.According to Altaf Halde, managing director (South Asia), Kaspersky Lab, while payments through smartphones are very convenient and frees one of the pressures to hold cash, it calls for precautions. One small slip-up can cause one a huge loss. While companies are bound by law to follow guidelines, fraudsters find their way through many security barricades. The only way to safeguard oneself, in such a scenario, is to be vigilant while paying and to keep the mobile protected with a security plan. With these two simple steps, people can ward off almost all financial theft risks. As the current adjustment period makes way for settlement, we are sure that more people, across economic strata, will find digital payments way more convenient and may make it their preferred mode of payment, says Halde.Being an online security firm, Kasperky Lab recommends that users should get themselves a mobile security plan.Moreover, interoperability issues are causing friction between banks and mobile wallet service providers.On 16 January, for instance, Mint reported that ICICI Bank Ltd had blocked transactions on payments app PhonePe in at least the second such instance of a commercial bank trying to protect its turf against non-bank mobile wallet and payment companies.PhonePe is a UPI app.A day later, PhonePes co-founder and chief executive officer Sameer Nigam took to microblogging site Twitter to allege that ICICI was blocking transactions since Friday (http://bit.ly/2jlYhGX).ICICI Bank cited security concerns as its reason for blocking PhonePe. NPCI initially ordered ICICI Bank to rectify the situation. Later, in a U-turn, it said PhonePe is in violation of UPI norms (http://bit.ly/2iT5Q3F)On 4 January, CNBC-TV18 reported that SBI had blocked net-banking transactions with e-wallet firms, although it allowed customers to top up their mobile wallets with debit and credit cards.At the time, SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya said the service was blocked because of security concerns.Roy insists that an open-access platform allows for interoperability for wallets operators, and diverse choice for customers. This will allow banks to have a wider acceptability of popular third-party prepaid cards and wallets, with minimal loading failure rates.Second, it will enable them to, inter alia, inter-operate seamlessly and with minimal friction across a multi-sided base comprising e.wallets, banks and common merchants (same QR code for instance).Third, banks will have to rework service level agreements with their PoS merchants and card networks to ensure a much higher reliability.In conclusion, says Roy, India is too large a country, diverse in its perceptions, behaviours and idiosyncrasies to have a one-size-fits-all strategy for a post-cash world.",2017-01-27,ODcuu2wmWqGWNUY6wHhmmJ,The rapid adoption of digital payment systems is seen as a potential silver lining to the exercise that caused a widespread cash crunch thats only now beginning to ease,both,01:27,Indias cash conundrum: how ready is India to go cashless?

				Reliance had in 2014 ordered building of six Very Large Ethane Carriers (VLECs) at Samsung Heavy Industries Pvt. Ltd shipyards in Korea. The vessels are the first to feature new membrane technology from French specialist Gaztransport & Technigaz SA(GTT), considered key to the execution of the project.With a capacity of 87,000 cubic meters, the two vessels are the largest ethane carriers built to date.In a ceremony held in Geoje (South Korea), RIL inaugurated its very first two VLECs, GTT said in a statement.The two vessels, named Ethane Crystal and Ethane Emerald, are the first in a series of six VLECs ordered by RIL in 2014.Japans biggest shipping company Mitsui OSK Lines Pvt. Ltd will manage and operate the ships for RIL.Ethane, a natural gas component, is expected to be produced in large volumes in North America due to the shale gas revolution, which has generated an abundance of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Ethane is primarily used as a petrochemical feedstock to produce ethylene by steam cracking.RIL plans to ship 1.5 million tonnes a year of ethane from its US shale joint ventures to its chemical complex in Gujarat. The firm has two joint ventures (JVs) in Pennsylvanias Marcellus Shaleone with Chevron Corp., in which it has invested $1.7 billion, and another with Houston-based Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc., in which it has invested $392 million. It has a third JV, in which it invested $1.5 billion, in Texas Eagle Ford Shale group with Dallas-based Pioneer Natural Resources Co.The worlds richest energy billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led RILs business spans petrochemicals, exploration and production, retail and telecommunications. As per the original contract, Samsung was to deliver the ships to be used for ethane transportation, from October 2016 to January 2017. Each ship is priced at $120 million.VLECs are a hybrid of LNG and LPG carriers. Due to the expectation of competitively priced ethane as opposed to naphtha, a crude oil byproduct, petrochemical producers are hoping to lower their production costs by using ethane.The VLECs are to transport liquefied ethane from the US to the Dahej terminal in Gujarat, which will be used to supply feedstock for RILs crackers in Dahej, Hazira and Nagothane.RIL has an ethane supply contract in place with Enterprise Product Partners out of their Morgans Point terminal in the US Gulf, which exported its first ethane cargo in September on a 27,500 cubic meter vessel for Ineos.Earlier this week, RIL had stated that it has secured a $573 million of loan for part-financing of the vessel construction costs.",2016-10-28,OGRgM8F15eacBFWFH19ugP,"The two vessels, named Ethane Crystal and Ethane Emerald, are the first in a series of six Very Large Ethane Carriers ordered by RIL in 2014",competitor,20:22,RIL gets worlds first very large ethane-carrying ships

-0.08,"New Delhi: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), operator of the worlds biggest oil-refining complex, has forayed into cooking gas retailing, launching a 4-kg LPG cylinder on pilot basis. Four-kg LPG cylinder launched in 4 districts on pilot basis, RIL said in an investor presentation on second-quarter earnings. 
				   
				LPG consumption is growing by over 10% and private refiners RIL and Essar Oil want a pie of it. Currently, public sector retailers Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum control retail LPG market, selling cooking gas in 5-kg, 14.2-kg and 19-kg cylinders. They sell 12 cylinders of 14.2-kg or 34 bottles of 5-kg per year to households on subsidized rates and any requirement above that on market price. The 19-kg cylinder is for commercial use. Private firms are not entitled for government subsidy and they have to sell fuel at market price. But with the government restricting volume of subsidy as well as barring consumers earning more than Rs10 lakh per annum from subsidised LPG, a ready-made market is now available for private oil companies. Mobile App rolled in all operating states to enhance customer experience, RIL said in the presentation. The company sells most of the LPG produced by its twin refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat to public sector retailers. While RIL did not disclose the price at which it is marketing the 4-kg cylinder, a 5-kg subsidized domestic LPG cylinder costs Rs58.50 in Delhi. A 5-kg cylinder for domestic use is priced at Rs181 while it costs Rs252.50 for non-domestic use. A subsidised 14.2-kg cylinder costs Rs427 in Delhi and a non-subsidized bottle comes for Rs490. A 19-kg cylinder is priced at Rs895. Domestic LPG consumption rose 10.8% in April-September this year to 10.2 million tonnes, nearly half of which was imported. The government had last year permitted RIL to sell up to 1.2 lakh tonnes of LPG produced at its plants to private cooking gas marketers. The LPG Control Order mandates that all cooking gas (LPG) produced locally must be supplied to state-run fuel retailing companies as India is deficient in LPG and has to import a part of the requirement. However, under the Parallel Marketing Scheme (PMS), private companies are allowed to import and market LPG to bulk consumers. Packed LPG business sales grew at 10% year-on-year basis, the company said in the presentation.

-0.25,"Ten days ago, L Catterton, the result of a merger between the private equity (PE) and real estate funds of LVMH Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessey SE, held its annual summit in New Delhi. L Capital, as the PE unit of LVMH used to be known, has invested in Fabindia, PVR and Genesis Luxury (it has exited from the first two). 
				   
				Ravi Thakran, managing partner and chairman of L Catterton Asia, known for his insightful understanding of the luxury and consumer goods markets of Asia, who was in the national capital for the summit, spoke to Mint about the urgent need to invest in Indian artisanal luxury. Thakrans belief that L Catterton could become a change agent in the arts and crafts sector given the right conditions may be a big idea whose time has come. He also argues why the Indian governments development agenda should include local luxury. How would you describe your experience of investing in and working with Indian companies? Any thoughts about the work culture here? I firmly believe that India has a long and credible history of entrepreneurship, which is manifest in many success stories across sectors. This story is only getting stronger, and it is encouraging to see new business ideas coming to fruition from first generation entrepreneurs, and a changing mindset within the old business families too. There have been various issues, such as policy certainty on the one hand, poor infrastructure on another and costly real estate, etc. that have been inhibitors to even higher growth. We are pleased at the progress being made by the current government in addressing some of these. Of course, we would all hope for faster progress on some of these fronts. Lastly, the one big issue impacting investments has been concerns around governance and transparency. Thankfully, the incidence is reducing, but as investors, one cant overemphasize the importance of entrepreneur selection. Has the merger of L Capital and L Catterton changed the companys essential parameters for choosing luxury, apparel or consumer brands to invest in? We have and will continue to be focused on the key consumer categories that appeal to the vast and growing middle class across Asia. Of course, with the combination, we benefit from a much longer experience base and wider global reach and insights. As Asia develops, some categories that were hitherto nascent in the Asian context, but relevant in North America, such as pet foods, health and fitness, etc., are now gaining traction. You have invested in Bateel dates in Dubai. There could be numerous such small potential parallels in the food business in India. Does anything particular from Kerala to Kashmir currently interest you?Given Indias vast and diverse food history, there clearly are a number of interesting food businesses that can be interesting globally. Some segments like Darjeeling tea are fairly obvious, but the key is to make the transition from a generic provenance to more distinctive branding. A related example that I could quote is the success that Fabindias subsidiary Organic India has had with commercialization of tulsi (a kind of basil ). Organic products and wellness products created from Ayurvedic or herbal ingredients are a part of Indias culture. Yet, no such brand has become a leading global name. What could be the reasons?I would not agree that India has had no success in this arena, with Himalaya being a very obvious example. Of course, if you look at the more premium segments of the global market, one would agree that no Indian business has been able to make a meaningful dent thus far. This is in part driven by the dynamics within the local market, in terms of price points, etc., which have an impact on how companies think about things like packaging, route to market and marketing, etc. But the more premium end of the market is now taking shape. Be it brands like Kama Ayurveda or Forest Essentials, these companies have clearly approached the opportunity differently and some of them will be able to evolve into brands that are relevant globally. Which is the most unusual and unexpected portfolio company L Catterton chose to work with anywhere in the world or in Asia? I am not sure if I would use the terminology unusual or unexpected, because as long-term, sector-focused investors, we only invest after a rigorous and detailed study of any investment. That being said, when we invested in PVR in India in 2012, it was our first investment in the media space, let alone the multiplex business. While not very obvious, we could clearly see that the company could benefit from our involvement, which as you can see from its success since, has clearly played out. Be it in helping the company grow inorganically, enhancing its digital interface and share of e-ticketing revenues, to increasing the contribution of non-ticket revenues, there have been multiple areas where we were able to contribute to their success. What do you think about luxury in India?India perhaps has the most evolved luxury products of the world. Whether they are from the glass industry of Firozabad or the perfumes of Kannaujwe should take pride in the diversity. There is a long list of Indian creations that symbolize cultural elegance as well as are a statement of worth and status without any logos. Wearing Indian luxury is the best way to say I am here to be myself, not to espouse a logo. That is the ultimate definition of luxury and the entire world is now moving towards embracing it. Take for instance, the white cotton dhoti with a gold border. It respects culture, is innovative, understated, has a name, is classic and yet can be so contemporary. While earlier many of these artisanal creations survived under the patronage of royalty, later due to various supply chain issues, the value of our craftsmen went down. We have the capacity to leapfrog but nobody is talking about building global luxury from India. The development agenda of the current government must make this a priority. India must wake up. I genuinely hope that luxury because of its labelling is not seen as elitist and kept aside. Look at how the Chinese build billion-dollar brands. We need to make that happen in India. Enriching craftsmen is a national responsibility.Did L Capital ever make an effort in the past to step in and create global brands out of Indian crafts and arts?We have been continuously exploring how to somehow provide the route or become the route to marketing this extraordinary luxury of India. In fact, a couple of years back, we tried to collaborate with a Kolkata designer who I would not like to name but someone who we believed could lead the project and curate products from 14-15 well known and significant weaving states of India and build them as a brand. Somehow it did not work out then.Will you revive that plan? Are you still looking for a design leader who can curate art and crafts brands for strategic brand building?Of course! This is my clarion call to anyone out there who deserves and commits to a curating leadership role. Craftsmen struggle to find platforms and at L Catterton we want to become that platform. We want to work with 10 chosen centres of excellence as one corporate body, become change agents, create a market route.",2016-10-29,OpJTGTg4VFbMukXENvPgyI,L Cattertons Ravi Thakran on why it is time to build global luxury from India and on the changes after the merger of L Capital and L Catterton,competitor,00:30,India needs to build billion-dollar brands: Ravi Thakran
-0.59,"The government announced a slew of measures in the hydrocarbon sector on Thursday that are expected to have a positive impact on the Indian energy sector in the long run. Importantly, there will be a uniform licensing system which will cover all hydrocarbons, i.e. oil, gas, coal bed methane, etc., which should help companies explore all kinds of oil and gas resources under one licence.
				   
				The blocks under the new policy will be awarded through an open-acreage policy, which will enable E&P (exploration and production) companies choose the blocks from the designated area. Also, there is a shift to a revenue-sharing model, which will be easy to administer for the government. The measures announced are positive for the sector and are expected to simplify licensing rules and accordingly boost investments in the sector.Whats in it for investors?One of the key announcements made is allowing pricing and marketing freedom for natural gas produced from difficult terrain. This would be applicable to all discoveries in deep water/ultra-deep water/high temperature/high pressure areas which were yet to commence commercial production as on 1 January 2016 and for all future discoveries in such areas.However, there is a ceiling price, which means that prices will not be totally free. According to analysts, the ceiling price based on new guidelines, starting 1 April works out to $6-6.5 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). Domestic gas prices are at $3.82 per mmBtu currently. That looks attractive but its important to realize that the benefits from this development are not going to be visible in the near future.As Nitin Tiwari, an analyst at Antique Stock Broking Pvt. Ltd, says, the new pricing for production from difficult fields could be beneficial for Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) when its KG-DWN-98/2 starts production. Similarly, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) too could benefit when it starts production from its R-Cluster and satellite fields. However, production from the above mentioned fields may start by FY19 or beyond, which means benefits from the development are accordingly going to accrue in the longer-run, than in near term, points out Tiwari.Secondly, the state of the macro environment and commodity (crude/NG/FO) prices would also be crucial for above mentioned developments as policy itself is not a sufficient condition to facilitate investment, he adds. The government has also said that in case of pending arbitration or litigation pertaining to gas pricing covering such fields, the new rules will be applicable only on the conclusion/withdrawal of such litigation/arbitration. This does not augur well for RIL, which is currently in a legal battle with the government over gas pricing. On Thursday, the ONGC stock had increased marginally, while RILs share price declined about 3%.",2016-03-11,OtBsKD5ZpPBcVmeUXksTsM,"The government announced a slew of measures in the hydrocarbon sector on Thursday that are expected to have a positive impact on the Indian energy sector in the long run

0.92,"London/New York: Millions of internet users lost access to some of the worlds most popular websites on Friday, as hackers hammered servers along the US East Coast with phony traffic until they crashed, then moved westward.
				   
				A global attack on one provider of Domain Name System services, Dyn Inc., took down sites including Twitter, Spotify, Reddit, CNN, Etsy and The New York Times for long stretches of time  from New York to Los Angeles.Kyle York, chief strategy officer of Dyn, said the hackers launched a so-called distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack using tens of millions of malware-infected devices connected to the internet. Speaking during a conference call on Friday afternoon, York said Dyn was actively dealing with a third wave of the attack.By Friday evening, Dyn said it had stopped the hacks. As you can imagine it has been a crazy day, Dyn spokesman Adam Coughlin wrote in an e-mail. At this moment (knock on wood) service has been restored.Security professionals have been anticipating a rise in attacks coming from malware that targets the Internet of Things, a new breed of small gadgets that are connected to the internet. That was after a hacker released software code that powers such malware, called Mirai, several weeks ago.Gillian M. Christensen, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said the agency and the FBI are aware of the incidents and investigating all potential causes.Internet havocDyn first reported site outages relating to the DDoS attack at around 7:10am New York time. The company restored service two hours later but was offline again at around noon, as another attack appeared to be underway, this time affecting the West Coast as well.While DDoS attacks dont steal anything, they create havoc across the internet -- and are on the rise in volume and power.Earlier in the day, Brian Krebs, a well-known journalist covering computer security, wrote that the timing of the attacks corresponded with the release of research conducted by Dyns director of internet analysis. Dyn highlighted potential connections between firms that offer to protect against DDoS attacks, and the hackers who conduct them. Krebss own website faced an extremely large and unusual DDoS attack after he published a story based on the same research, he said.We cant confirm or even speculate on anyones motivation or relation to that research, said Dave Allen, Dyns general counsel.Common warfareWith attacks on the internets Domain Name System, hackers compromise the underlying technology that governs how the web functions, making the hack far more powerful and widespread.The DNS translates website names into the Internet Protocol addresses that computers use to look up and access sites. But it has a design flaw: Sending a routine data request to a DNS server from one computer, the hacker can trick the system into sending a monster file of IP addresses back to the intended target. Multiply that by tens of thousands of computers under the hackers control, and the wall of data that flooded back is enormous. A small server may be capable of handling hundreds of simultaneous requests, but thousands every minute cause overload and ultimately shut down, taking the websites it hosts offline with it.The practice often is employed by groups of hackers. In 2012, a DDoS attack forced offline the websites of Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., U.S. Bancorp and PNC Financial Services Group Inc.A DDoS can be achieved in a number of ways, but commonly involves a distributed network of so-called zombie machines, referred to as botnets. A botnet is formed with computers and other connected devices in homes or offices infected with malicious code which, upon the request of a hacker, can flood a web server with data. One or two machines wouldnt be an issue, but if tens or hundreds of thousands fire such data simultaneously, it can cripple even the most sophisticated web servers.In the case of the Dyn incident, the computers targeted were DNS servers. Without a DNS server, large numbers of websites are inaccessible by users across a country or even the world. In other words, taking away the DNS servers is like taking away all the road signs on a countrys highway system. Single company targetedSo-called authoritative DNS providers like Dyn are notoriously hard to secure. Carl Herberger, vice president for security solutions at Radware, an Israeli-based internet security company, likens authoritative DNS providers to hospitals, which must admit anyone who shows up at the emergency room. Dyn must consider traffic going to a website as initially legitimate. In the event of a DDoS, Dyn must work quickly to sort out the bad traffic from the good, which takes time and resources, and creates outages that ripple across the internet, as was the case Friday.Dave Palmer, director of technology at UK cybersecurity company Darktrace, said the most recent DDoS attacks have been linked to Internet of Things devices, in particular web cams.The joke about the Internet of Things was that you were going to get people hijacking peoples connected fridges to conduct these attacks, but in these recent cases the culprit seems to be webcams, Palmer said. We will probably see, when this is investigated, that it is a botnet of the Internet of Things.To avoid massive outages, companies ramp up their capacity to try to absorb the deluge of traffic and reroute it, often with the help of a major telecommunications carrier or cloud-services provider like Akamai Technologies Inc. and CloudFlare Inc. But the only way to really prevent denial-of-service attacks may be to increase the overall security level of consumers around the world, Palmer said, a task that is getting harder as more and more devices are connected to the Internet.This is exactly what happens when tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of devices are left unprotected, Palmer said.

-1.0,"Singapore: What does Cyrus Mistry want? Ever since his summary 24 October dismissal as chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, the spurned executive has demanded a reason for his sacking from the holding company of Indias $103 billion salt-to-software conglomerate.
				   
				At the same time, Mistry, 48, has accused Ratan Tata, the 78-year-old who wrested back control of the group, of everything from a control fetish to governance failures and bad judgment. According to Mistry, Ratan Tatas 2006 purchase of Corus Group Plcs British steel assets, his vanity small-car project as well as the acquisition of pricey hotels have exposed the empire that bears his familys name to an existential threat.Some of this could just be wounded pride, but even if Mistrys allegations have a kernel of truth, what does he gain from trash-talking a group in which his family owns 18.4%? One possible answer is that he mightif he can convince enough outside investors in operating companies to side with himprize open the loosely controlled conglomerate, and pluck out a big reward.Tuesdays shareholder meeting of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, the software business, may have been a practice session in that treasure hunt. Tata Sons 73% stake in TCS was enough for Ratan Tata to get Mistry thrown out as its chairman. But at five other companiesIndian Hotels Co. Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd, Tata Chemicals Ltd and Tata Power Co. Ltdthe founding group owns less than 40%. All of them hold shareholder meetings between 13 December and 26 December to vote on Mistrys fate.Also read: What if other Tata group shareholders vote the same way as those at TCS?In three of them, he will have a formidable backer. Mistrys own core supporters, fired together with him, have no clout. But Nusli Wadia, the scion of one of Indias oldest business families, is a heavyweight. He has spent a combined 90 years on three Tata boards.At Tata Steel, where Wadia is the longest-serving independent director, hes already questioning the validity of the companys brand licensing agreement with Tata Sons, a younger company that received its first royalty payment 91 years after the steelmakers founding. Wadia wants an examination of the agreement.A similar suggestion at Tata Motors, where Wadia has been on the board for 18 years, would be a thinly veiled call for mutiny. The ultimate prize may be Jaguar Land Rover, the crowning glory of Ratan Tatas dealmaking career.Tata Sons boosted its stake in Tata Motors by 1.7% on the day of the TCS vote, and is open to buying more ahead of the 22 December extraordinary general meeting. This must be the Wadia effect. Even at TCS, retail shareholders overwhelmingly voted against Mistrys ouster. If Wadias PR spiel can swing enough of them away from Ratan Tata, the latters control of Jaguar Land Rover might be at risk, provided Mistry can raise money for an open offer to shareholders, a condition on which the market regulator may well insist.

-0.05,"Moscow: The Russian governments sale of a controlling stake in mid-sized oil firm Bashneft to the countrys largest oil producer Rosneft should give momentum to Russias privatisation drive, president Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday.
				   
				The economy ministry said that the government had completed the sale of the Bashneft stake to Kremlin-owned Rosneft for 329.69 billion roubles ($5.30 billion).Rosneft bought a 50.08% stake in Bashneft, Russias fastest growing oil company with production of 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) and extensive refining assets, beating an offer from an unidentified second bidder.The sale is a key step in a government privatisation push meant to raise cash to plug budget holes amid low oil prices and Western sanctions imposed over Ukraine.The main thing is that we dont stop the privatisation process on this (Bashneft sale), Putin said at an economic forum.This privatization is carefully crafted, keeping in mind the synergy effect for obtaining the maximal gain from the point of view of budget and fiscal interests, he said.Putin said that now a 19.5% stake in Rosneft could be sold to private foreign investors.The Bashneft deal has caused tensions, with the government postponing the sale in August to calm rivalry among powerful groups before September parliamentary elections.Several Russian government officials including deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich had said previously they opposed plans by Rosneft chief executive Igor Sechin to expand further.One state-controlled company, Rosneft, buying another, Bashneft, could hardly be called a proper privatisation, they said.It may sound strange to you but I personally was surprised by this governments position myself, Putin said on Wednesday, referring to the decision to allow Rosneft to buy Bashneft.Putin said later on Wednesday that Rosneft used its own funds to buy the Bashneft stake, where 25% is owned by internal republic of Bashkortostan. It remains unclear if Rosneft will buy that stake later, too.Rosneft production stands at around 4.1 million bpd now and is expected to grow thanks to new fields coming onstream this year.According to a regulatory statement, Bashnefts board plans to vote on a new chief executive on Thursday. Alexander Korsik, who oversaw Bashnefts production spike, is expected to be replaced by Andrey Shishkin, a vice-president at Rosneft.A source familiar with the situation said the management board was also expected to be taken over by Rosneft managers. Bashneft declined comment.Sechin has said that the purchase of Bashneft would provide a synergy effect for the company. Rosneft is considering buying out part of the Rosneft stake set for privatisation itself, as one of the options.The state hopes to raise around 700 billion roubles from the Rosneft privatisation to plug holes in the budget.

-0.12,"New Delhi: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is one of the highly capitalized central banks of the world, and the government can redeploy some of its capital for fund infusion in state-owned banks and setting up a public sector asset reconstruction company (ARC), according to the Economic Survey 2017 that was tabled in the Parliament on Tuesday.
				   
				The key principle that should be observed in this process is that the excess capital in the RBI, including that created by demonetisation, is a balance sheet or wealth gain and not an income gain. Hence, the uses to which this is put should be of a balance sheet nature, said the Economic Survey.ALSO READ | RBI governors appointment impacted Indian market: Economic SurveyObserving that there is no particular reason why this extra capital should be kept with RBI, the survey said it is one of the most highly capitalised central banks in the world. Even at current levels, the RBI is already exceptionally highly capitalised, and so, it would seem to be more productive to redeploy some of this capital in other ways, the survey added. Assuming that RBI returns Rs4 lakh crore of capital to the government, what are the uses to which this capital can be put? It could be used in several good ways...first for recapitalizing the banks and/or recapitalizing a Public Sector Asset Rehabilitation Agency (PARA), it said. Second, for extinguishing debt to demonstrate that the government is serious about a strong public sector fiscal position. It cannot be emphasized enough that any strategy to use the excess capital must be done carefully that in no way undermines or circumvents the relevant laws. It must also be done with the full cooperation of the RBI to ensure that the RBIs independence and credibility are in no way undermined, it said.Economic Survey: Big banks may be declining UPI transactions involving smaller banksTalking about global precedents for governments using the capital in their central banks for their own purposes, the Economic Survey said the US Federal Reserve gave $19 billion from its surplus capital to finance transportation projects in 2015. In 2004, the Bundesbank extinguished its old Deutsche Mark currency and counted it as income in the profit and loss account because it was deemed highly unlikely that these would ever be exchanged for euros, the survey said, pointing to the benefit from the extinguishing of bank notes. Highlighting economic objections to the use of excess capital of the central bank by the government, it said the central bank also faces risks to its balance sheet from interest rate changes. If interest rates increase, value of its government bond holdings will decline, inflicting valuation losses. However, risks from interest rate increases are quantitatively less important for the RBI given the composition of its assets. Moreover, these risks will, in general, be negatively correlated with exchange rate risks, it said.

				The stock gained 3.25% on a day the broader market dipped mildly.One reason could be that these shares have already been battered. They are fifth from the bottom in terms of stock price returns over the last 12 months. PNB shares are also trading at 0.34 times their expected book value for the current fiscal year, but then all state-owned banks are trading below their one-year forward book values.Perhaps investors chose to focus on the fact that total stressed assets (gross bad loans plus restructured loans) remained at almost a similar level as the preceding quarter17.79% of total advances versus 17.41%.
PNB also took some one-time hits to both its bad loans and provisions. For instance, Rs.1,600 crore worth of loans to state distribution companies (discoms), which were not converted to bonds, had to be categorized as bad loans as per central bank requirements, said a note from Religare Securities Ltd. The bank also made other provisions such as Rs.140 crore for its state discom bonds and another Rs.170 crore for Punjab food creditthings that are unlikely to recur in the coming quarters.So much for the good news. Is the worst over?In a post-results media conference, the management demurred from using that phrase. The Religare note, on the other hand, says the PNB management stated that seven stressed sectors account for 55% of non-performing assets and with strong recoveries (of about Rs.15,000-20,000 crore), gross bad loans should start declining from the second quarter onwards.Its difficult to share this optimism.For one, recoveries totalled  Rs.4,262 crore in the just-ended fiscal year, but what will lead to a fourfold jump this fiscal year?Second, PNB is still sitting on Rs.20,000 crore of restructured accounts. A good amount of slippages in the March quarter would have come from the restructured book, which stood at around Rs.35,000 crore at the end of the December quarter. Thus, this pile of restructured assets still represents a threat.Third, the bank has said it has around Rs.11,000 crore in loans classified as SMA-2 (basically loans whose principal or interest payment is overdue for 61-180 days), according to Religare. This is another red flag for investors.Fourth, at the end of the December quarter, the bank had Rs.14,000 crore of loans under the 5/25 and strategic debt restructuring (SDR) schemes. It is not known whether this pile has increased or decreased since then. The 5/25 scheme allows loan repayments by infrastructure developers to be stretched out over a longer tenure. SDR allows creditors to convert debt into equity and take operational control of defaulting borrowers. Despite an almost threefold increase in provisions year-on-year, PNBs provision coverage ratio is only 51.06%.

				The chief executives of the countrys biggest IT services companies will meet with administration officials and lawmakers from 20 February to try and dissuade Trumps team from raising requirements under the H-1B visa programme, said R.

Indias largest IT services corporations, including Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys Ltd, depend on the system to insert foreign talent on the ground to work with US clients.The message from H1B visa reformsTrumps administration is drafting an executive order aimed at overhauling the work-visa programmes used to hire tens of thousands of employees each year.Curbs could transform the way American firms such as Apple Inc. and Indian firms such as Wipro Ltd recruit, to offset a dearth of homegrown US engineering talent.Businesses would have to try to hire American first and if they opt for foreign workers, priority would be given to the most highly paidmaking hiring more expensive.We want to put across to the new administration and the lawmakers what would be lost by America closing those doors, said Chandrashekhar, who will join the delegation on a four-day visit to the US capital.Nasscom has already shared its concerns with its own government.The silver lining in immigration reformWe have talked to the government, which will do what it needs to do; but we are parallelly pursuing our own course of action.Its not clear how much force an executive order would carry if its signed by the president.Congress is also working on visa reforms and the parties will have to cooperate to pass new laws. Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat from California, introduced a bill last week to tighten requirements for the H-1B work visa programme.News of the draft executive order has sent Indian information technology (IT) stocks reeling this week and fuelled a sharp rise in inquiries to local placement firms from current H-1B visa holders exploring options back home.Senior executives are putting together contingency plans in the event they cant get enough workers into the US to work with their clients, which include many of Americas top banks and corporations.H1B visa reform: Why US companies are worrying about changesThe topic may well come up during a conversation between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump slated for June, Chandrashekhar said.Nasscom encompasses nearly 2,400 technology companies across the country but Chandrashekhar said the CEO delegation will comprise mainly chief executives of companies that are the biggest users of H-1B visas. He declined to name them but data show the heaviest employers include Tata Consultancy, Infosys, Wipro, HCL Technologies, Tech Mahindra and Mindtree.In New Delhi, foreign ministry spokesman Vikas Swarup said, No executive order has been signed so far. All that has happened is that three private bills have been introduced in the US House of Representatives. Such bills have been introduced in the past also and such bills have to go through the full Congressional process.

Mistry was removed before he had an opportunity to present these issues at the 24 October board meeting of Tata Sons. Tata trusts have all the rights through representation on the holding companys board to ensure that the flow of dividends for them is steady and that the company is not taking undue risks. However, the governance document sought to clarify the role of each entity and ensure that the promoters exercised their rights through their nominee directors, the two said. The root cause of the current conflict in the Tata group is the groups operating structure itself, proxy advisory firm Institutional Investors Advisory Services said in a 12 November note. Tata trusts exert control over Tata Sons, which exerts control over operating companies, several of which are publicly traded and subject to scrutiny by external stakeholders including shareholders, the note said.ALSO READ | Cyrus Mistry rebuts Tatas takeover bid claimThe governance document, the two people cited above said, is important in view of the events that culminated in the boardroom coup.

-0.91,"The Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) have prompted an interesting change in the way companies look at their assets. Following the transition to the new norms, companies assets have seen wide-scale revaluation, resulting in significant profit increases for the earlier quarter as companies restate those results as per the new accounting norms to compare them with the latest quarterly results.
				   
				This offers an opportunity to see how much the changes in the accounting standards have affected company financials. Moreover, the revaluation has been done in such a way that it will continue to act as a tailwind for profits in the days ahead.Property, plant and equipment (PP&E) revaluations account for the biggest adjustments to profits under Ind AS. The total immediate profit impact of adjustments to PP&E is already worth at least Rs10,776 crore, according to a Mint analysis of recent results data from 72 large firms (from among BSE 100 companies) conducted in partnership with consulting firm KPMG. All figures compare the September 2015 numbers under the old accounting standards with numbers calculated under the new rules. The total absolute value of profit adjustments made (including upward and downward revisions) was Rs19,500 crore. PP&E adjustments accounted for Rs10,776 crore or 55.26% of the changes. The equivalent adjustment made for the June quarter was a negative adjustment of Rs68.35 crore.Sai Venkateshwaran, partner and head of accounting advisory services at KPMG in India, said some companies that had written down their assets in the September 2015 quarter under the old accounting norms have revalued these assets to their fair values on transition to Ind AS. This has led to a reversal of some of the earlier write-downs in the September 2015 quarter, which has improved the profits for that quarter when restated under the new norms.ALSO READ | Transition to  Ind Asconnect the dots to see the real pictureAccording to Venkateshwaran, the new standards allow the fair value of PP&E at the date of transition to be used as its deemed cost. Many companies have used this provision to write down certain assets like plant and equipment to their fair value. On the other hand, several companies have also written up assets such as land to their fair value.The write-down of depreciable assets by some of these companies could have a significant, continuing positive impact on their profits in the days ahead, he said.What do these changes mean on the ground?Consider a firm that had total PP&E worth Rs1 lakh. The land was earlier valued at Rs25,000 and the rest of the factory worth Rs75,000. Suppose that when the company revalues it, a higher value is assigned to the land (say Rs60,000) and a lower amount to the rest (Rs40,000 in our example). The non-land portion sees lower depreciation because of this revaluation. Assigning a higher value to land, and a lower value to other assets increases profits because of this lower depreciation. Land is not depreciated.The result of these adjustments was seen in profit gains when September 2015 results were declared.Integrated oil and gas firms made PP&E adjustments of Rs4,058 crore, according to KPMG data. Firms making iron and steel and intermediate products made similar adjustments of Rs7,091.5 crore (see Chart 1).The iron and steel companies saw their profits more than triple to Rs5,705 crore under the new norms. This makes the sector one of the key gainers profit-wise because of net adjustments under the new norms (Rs3,801 crore). Another gainer is the integrated oil and gas segment, which saw profits rise by Rs2,625 crore to Rs9,345 crore.Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities Ltd, said a number of firms have had to mark down their fixed assetsPP&E against reserves, because the new regulations require these assets to be valued at a level which correctly reflects their remaining useful life. This would have had a negative impact on their net worth, which would have adverse implications for firms carrying high debt.ALSO READ | Profiting from new accounting standardsThese companies probably looked at old value land on their books and revalued it upwards by crediting their reserves to markup their net worth, he said.Independent market analyst Anand Tandon said, The accounting standard allows revaluation, so some of this is inevitable. You have to assume that companies will report as per their convenience.The largest adjustments were made by Tata Steel Ltd. Its profits were revised upwards to the tune of Rs7,463.02 crore because of PP&E adjustments. Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) made PP&E adjustments to its profits worth Rs4,058 crore, according to second-quarter results. (Third-quarter results showed zero such adjustments for the December 2015 numbers).Tata Steel did not respond to email, text and telephonic requests for comment.RIL said it had to revise certain assets downwards to abide by the new regulations. At the same time, it revised its land assets upwards and also the impairment of exploration and production assets because of the change in rules.Land which had been acquired over the decades and held at its historical acquisition cost, has been revalued upwards to reflect its fair value on the balance sheet without causing any impact on reported earnings, said an RIL spokesperson.In case of exploration and production assets, the new norms said they should be accounted for using the successful efforts method instead of using full costs, leading to a reversal in impairment taken, the spokesperson added (see Chart 2).The new accounting standards negatively impacted sectors such as commercial vehicles, and breweries and distilleries too. The latter saw profits erode by Rs854 crore. Commercial vehicle companies saw their losses increase from Rs143 crore to Rs1,589 crore.The reconciliation numbers are based on profits as defined by the company. Some firms may use profit numbers after adjusting for minority interest, others would not. There is no set rule for which profit numbers are used for reconciliation purposes. This is why there is a difference between adjustments by reconciliation numbers and the impact on the more well-tracked profit after tax numbers. The profit after tax number is calculated on a uniform basis across companies.Profits for the 72 companies are up by Rs1,011 crore, or 1.6%, to Rs64,321 crore.This is in spite of Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) dropping 3.72%. The overall Ebitda figure dropped to Rs1.32 trillion on account of the transition to the new accounting standards.Other factors including lower taxes also helped result in higher after-tax profits. This year is the first in which companies are following the new norms.All companies with a net worth of Rs500 crore or more have to abide by the new norms from 1 April 2016. It will apply to those with a net worth of Rs250 crore one year later. Financial institutions such as banks and non-banking financial companies will have to follow Ind AS from 1 April 2018.Whats the big deal? Companies have revised profits upwards citing PP&E (property, plant and equipment) adjustments. The value of these adjustments is already in excess of Rs10,000 crore, shows the latest quarterly comparison. A look into the changes show that they are the outcome of balance-sheet adjustments made after the new accounting standards came into effect. Experts says many companies have had to revise some assets downwards because of stringent new norms.This would have affected net worth of already indebted companies. So, some have chosen to revise land value upwards to preserve net worth, resulting in the changes seen. This in turn is reflected in the latest disclosed financials. An analysis of financials shows that land has been given higher value and other assets are valued lower. This will lower depreciation and increase profit numbers in the days ahead as well.",2017-01-31,PxA2QFXfQ5hkiS9egHPXfM,"Property, plant and equipment revaluations account for the biggest adjustments to profits of 72 large BSE 100 companies under Ind AS, finds a Mint-KPMG analysis",both,01:31,"The Rs10,000 crore profit adjustment"

				Overhauled MacBook Pro laptops and a new computer monitor were presented in a press conference at Apples Cupertino, California, headquarters. While laptops are traditionally more profitable for Apple than the iPad, customers often spend more on films, music and apps with the iPad, making it a long-term moneymaker. The new MacBook Pro has a Touch ID fingerprint scanner which makes it easier to buy online using the Apple Pay payments system.Jobs heralded tablets as laptop replacements by calling the iPad a post-PC device after it launched in 2010. But products like the MacBook Pro have shown surprising resilience. While Mac revenue has fallen from its 2015 peak, the decline in iPad sales has been more precipitous and the laptop now outsells the tablet. Chief executive officer (CEO) Tim Cook has meanwhile sought to expand services revenue from the App Store, iTunes and iCloud to offset slowing hardware sales.The new version of the MacBook Pro comes with either a 13-inch or 15-inch display. The new laptops are lighter, thinner and narrower than their predecessors, and include larger trackpads and faster chips.Also read: Apple MacBook Pro 2016 line-up: Everything you need to knowThe highlight was a new digital function display at the top of the keyboard called the Touch Bar, replacing physical buttons. The thin organic light-emitting diode screen allows functions to change based on the application currently in use. Prices start at $1,499 for a 13-inch version without the new Touch Bar. The 15-inch one starts at $2,399, Apple said.While we dont expect the updates to meaningfully move the needle, we believe this should return the Mac segment to growth in the near term, Minneapolis-based Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said in a note to clients, reiterating his overweight rating.Apple also announced a 5K monitor developed with LG Electronics Inc. that connects to the new MacBook Pro, and a new TV app.Apple last released new laptop computers in the middle of 2015, and has gradually lost customers in the intervening period. The iPhone makers personal computing market share fell to 7.4% in the three months through September, down from 8.1% a year earlier, researcher IDC said this month.Apple is going to be able to regain some of the market share that theyve lost in the higher end notebook market because so many of their products have got so long in the tooth, Shannon Cross, an analyst at Cross Research, said before the event.Apple shares slipped about 1% to $114.48 at the close in New York. The stock had jumped about 20% in the past three months on hope for strong sales of the new iPhone 7. After a cautious holiday forecast earlier this week from the company, the shares have given up some of those gains.If Apple is able to sell more services through Macs, they can become far more profitable than iPads, Needham & Co. analyst Laura Martin said before the product launch. Then you really do want to sell more Macs, because its not only a higher upfront fee but then if you can get the same services revenue thats a more powerful growth engine.The Macs average selling price is almost $800 more than the iPad, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and Apple got 11% of its $216 billion annual revenue from the computer, with the iPhone accounting for most of the rest.Siri, introduced to the Mac operating system in September, could also help guarantee a cut of revenue from taxis, meals and other services ordered with the virtual assistant via computers.

0.08,"Mumbai:  ICICI Bank Ltd, Indias largest private sector lender, on Monday reported the highest quarterly increase in bad loans on a year-on-year basis in 10 years, suppressing net profit growth to an anaemic 2.37%.
				   
				The banks gross non-performing assets (NPAs) more than doubled to Rs32,178.60 crore in the three months ended 30 September from Rs15,857 crore a year ago. Gross NPAs made up 6.82% of the banks loan book, compared to 5.87% in the previous quarter and 3.77% in the year-ago quarter.Total slippages, or new bad loans, during the quarter, including slippages from restructured loan book and watch list of corporate loans, stood at Rs8,000 crore.At the end of the March quarter, the bank had created a watch list of loans worth Rs44,065 crore. These were sub-investment grade loans which were at risk of slipping into the non-performing loans category.More than Rs9,100 crore of these loans turned bad during the first six months of the year and Rs2,461 crore of loans in this category got upgraded during the same period. The watch list of loans now was reduced to Rs32,490 crore at the end of the September quarter.From the two large deals, i.e. the sale of cement plant by Jaypee Prakash Industries and sale of Essar Oil, we expect significant reduction in portfolio over 6-9 months, subject to necessary approvals and subject to transactions getting completed. We have received some amount in October 2016 which are part of the planned repayment arising out of these resolutions, said Chanda Kochhar, managing director and chief executive officer of ICICI Bank, in a call with journalists after the earnings announcement.Kochhar added that the bank continues to focus on reducing exposure to stressed sectors like power, iron and steel, mining, cement and rigs. The total exposure to these sectors decreased from 13% at the end of March to 11.9% at the end of September.As a result of higher slippages, provisions rose 651% from a year ago to Rs7,082.69 crore. This includes Rs3,588 crore of additional provisions made by the bank to strengthen its balance sheet.This is over and above the contingency reserve of Rs3,600 crore that the bank created in the January-March quarter.Despite higher provisions, the bank reported a marginal increase in profit in the July-September quarter, owing to the gains made from the sale of ICICI Bank shares in its life insurance arm.The banks net profit in the second quarter rose to Rs3,102.27 crore from Rs3,030.11 crore reported a year ago. A Bloomberg poll of 19 analysts had expected the bank to post a net profit of Rs2,467.7 crore.The bank reported its results after stock markets closed on Monday. ICICI Bank shares ended at Rs278.75 on the BSE, up 3.4% from its previous close.The banks other income rose three-fold to Rs9,120 crore, including a gain of Rs5,682 crore from sale of its 12.63% stake in ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd through the IPO. Net interest income, or the difference between interest earned on loans and that spent on deposits, however, remained flat at Rs5,253 crore this quarter.The fact that slippages from the regular loan book had been contained was a positive sign, said Siddharth Purohit, senior banking analyst, Angel Broking Ltd.Going by the current quarter, it seems the bank will largely be able to clean up the book and start looking at regular growth from H2 FY18, Purohit said.",2016-11-07,Q4vgiKKxVu55VZZ5WLOx3L,"ICICI Banks  gross non-performing assets (NPAs) more than doubled to Rs32,178.60 crore in the second quarter",both,16:55,ICICI Bank Q2 net profit crimped by rising bad loans

The brokerage house has revisited its estimates for farm income and reduced estimated total income growth of 6%/13% y-o-y for a small/large farmer in FY17, from 12%/17% earlier. Due to liquidity-related challenges and issues with co-operative banks after demonetisation, dependence on money lenders has risen for the small farmer in the interim, thus worsening their credit profile, it added.

				Richard Usher, formerly of JPMorgan Chase & Co., Rohan Ramchandani, who used to work for Citigroup Inc., and Chris Ashton, a former Barclays Plc trader, were indicted Tuesday on conspiracy charges in New York. Theyre all living in the UK and will have to be extradited unless they surrender voluntarily.The three men used an online chatroom they dubbed The Cartel to coordinate trading of US dollars and euros and manipulate prices of the currencies, according to the indictment. They are charged with conspiring to restrain trade from the end of 2007 through the beginning of 2013. The goal of the conspiracy was to suppress and eliminate competition in the trading of the euro and the dollar in the US, UK and Switzerland, according to the charges.The case represents the culmination of the governments promise to prosecute individuals at the center of one of the biggest market-manipulation investigations of the Obama administration.

-0.25,"The juggernaut of digital advertising continues to roll ahead, undeterred by sceptics and naysayers who are questioning if brands have already over-invested in the medium. As we cross the chasm of adoption and enter the eye of the tornado, 2017 will provide the perfect space and time for a little reflection. 
				   
				The story of six blind people describing an elephant has an interesting parallel in the world of digital advertising. We have been deluged by techno-babble around search, social, video, mobile, native and programmaticthrow in a couple more in the room and now you have programmable (distinct from programmatic) and AI (artificial intelligence) to add on to the ever-growing list of stuff that makes up digital advertising. First, some numbers to set the context. Digital advertising in India is forecast to breach the $1 billion milestone in 2016-17. There is a lot of headroom for growth, when you look at the rapidly growing smartphone consumer base over the next five yearsprojected to rise 4x, up to 820 million. A more compelling indicator for digital spends that can ride this wave is the uptick in data consumption; climbing up at a compounded annual growth rate of 30% and projected to reach 7GB/month (per active user) by 2021 (according to the Ericsson Mobility Report of 2016). So why does digital ad spending in India still stand at just 15% of the total advertising pie, unlike the over 40% share in evolved markets? Where does the problem lie? I believe that the advertising model for digital in India is fundamentally broken. Very little responsible action has been taken by publishers and media agencies and to some extent even clients, rendering a large part of such a potent medium ineffective. Digital advertising is all about effectivenessand we all grew up to understand this is the only medium that has the power to deliver the relevant signals from consumers. And yet, in the limited buying exercises we conducted in 2016, we saw publishers turning a blind eye to traffic quality and relevance of audience profile. Unfathomable performance metrics and targeting parameters are spun out as yarns; many clients fall hook, line and sinker for these. Search will continue to reign over display despite its limitations to deliver scale. For categories that score high on digital influence (consumers researching online) and digital density (consumers buying online), measuring intent is keyand search will be simply unbeatable in capturing intent-laden traffic emanating on the horizontal screen. Content will be the game changer in categories that are digital emergent and score low on both influence and density. Brands that will consistently invest in content will have more success in influencing the influencers. A leading few will be able to articulate a vision leveraging such content for communities and launch their brand-as-a-service to fulfil some need gaps.Mobile is the tricky part to understand. While time spent on the vertical screen is witnessing an inexorable rise, the platform choice is influenced by content, and behaviour is heavily skewed to messaging, social, entertainment and news. Time spent using the mobile browser is more than native apps in developing economies, and India is no exception as local research suggests. Advertising choices on the mobile are thus far more compelling yet terribly complex. Native advertising makes the best sense of all available options backing search, especially for brands investing heavily in content. Forecasts that indicate this format reaching 75% (of total display advertising) in mature markets like the US, make complete sense as of now. But where does native work bestsocial, in-publisher feed, or sponsored content? It is a tough question that can best be answered by the format of advertising you choose.Videos have a really, really bad track record on social, and Facebook has been struggling to revise recommended metrics of meaningful video consumption. Certainly, Facebook scores over any other platform in its innate ability to spread content, but when it comes to video, the numbers have to be taken with a pinch of salt. In fact, for advertising content (including brand story telling) delivered via video, I have found YouTube to return far more tangible value. Shares are a great number to flaunt on social, but barring the outliers, the effectiveness of advertising views is extremely poor when you have little control on how your content spreads. Not everyone who shares your video actually watches it completely. What needs fixing in 2017?We need clarity on what large publishers are throwing at our face in terms of targetingwhether it is audience in-market or audience insights. We accept many such publisher definitions at face value, and there is no vehicle for grievance redress when the performances dont match up to the promise. Viewable impressions (and related discussions on ad fraud) have just started being addressed with new technologies, and this needs strong push in the coming years. What needs terribly urgent fixing, and nearer home, is blatant corruption by some publishers who outsource traffic generation to farms (both human and bots), and media agencies that hand-in-glove push bulk-buys from such publishers. Clients have to take a fair share of responsibility for landing the industry in this mess because they refuse to pay the required service fees to an agency to run digital media with brains. The bulk buying metrics that work for mainline media are applied to digital by old-school media buyers; and at 3% commissions with no accountability on performance, everyone just ends up pulling a fast one on each other.At the end of the day, it is simple for you to examine traffic quality, to arrive at your own conclusions about who is clean and who is tainted. Which platform was more effective for completed videos views? Did the high number of shares on your contagious content reach the targeted audience? What percentage of the traffic on your website disappeared under 10 seconds? You have to start asking the hard questions and stand up to your management and speak the brutal truth.Takeaways for 2017 Experiment always: There has never been a better time to experiment with formats and newer platforms. With emergence of 360 degree video and Live (broadcast live like Twitter with Periscope, Facebook Live etc.), the possibility of creative in-feed advertising content has taken a leap forward. Splurge some money on interactive content advertising and learn from the engagement data.Approach hype with cautious optimism: The dynamics of digital introduces new technology every year that in turn triggers hype cycles. You can choose to skip some, like Dynamic Creative Optimization or VR (Virtual Reality is certainly the next big thing in content). Adobe has demonstrated use of technology to change subject lines of e-mailers to counter ad-fatigue, and I am a big believer in dynamic emailers that compose content on the flyso maybe that is something worth pursuing if you are big on triggered e-mailersstuff that dominates early part of your relationship with a subscriber (before fatigue sets in).Invest in dashboard technology: Measure your key performance indicators. You will need a bespoke dashboard using smart widgets that track share of search, product sentiment, audience recency/loyalty and purchase intent, etc. You must track social presence and advertising effectiveness. Conduct an interaction health check. Most importantly, split the management view (input vs. output) from the practitioners, so you can demonstrate return on investment. Wire up your assets: For those who have reached a mature state of digital marketing running multiple brand assets (web, social, apps), 2017 will be time to wire them up using consumer-profiling technology. A mature digital business needs to know consumers better to be able to deliver smarter advertising. Capturing the state of mind of your audience is a crucial departure you can make with programmable advertising. Understand digital for offline: Connecting online advertising with offline sales is the next holy grail of accountability and few publishers are doing pioneering work in the area. Experiment with advertising that supports the consumer decision journey (ROPOresearch online, purchase offline) instead of banal re-targeting.Focus on quality: Stop spending money in the wrong places. Find the right partner to support your vision and make sure you work out a compensation structure that incentivizes your partner to deliver quality.

According to a Bloomberg poll of 17 analysts, the bank had been expected to post a net profit of Rs2,585.40 crore.Provisions against bad loans jumped 99.64% to Rs7,669.66 crore in the quarter from Rs3,841.77 crore in the year-ago period. On a sequential basis, provisions were up 21% from the June quarters Rs6,339.56 crore. The provision coverage ratio fell to 62.16% from 70.48%.SBI reported fresh slippagesor new bad loansworth Rs 10,341 crore during the July-September period, higher than Rs 8,790 crore in the June quarter and Rs5,875 crore in the same quarter last year. Loan recoveries fell to Rs1,344 crore from Rs1,647 crore a year ago.Slippages worth Rs4,853 crore came from the watchlist, which is now at around Rs25,951 crore. We expect 75-80% slippages from the watchlist going ahead. The watchlist is expected to come down by Rs5,000-7,000 crore in the coming months, said SBI chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya.Bhattacharya expects loan recovery to pick up later this year. Visibility of recovery is much greater about large value accounts compared to a quarter ago. Focus on recovery has not shifted and will not shift.., she added.Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) at SBI rose 4.18% to Rs1.05 trillion at the end of the September quarter from Rs1.01 trillion in the June quarter. On a year-on-year basis, gross NPAs jumped 86.13% from Rs56,834.28 crore. As a percentage of total loans, gross NPAs stood at 7.14% at the end of the September quarter compared to 6.94% in the previous quarter and 4.15% in the year-ago quarter.Net NPAs made up 4.19% of the loan book in the September quarter compared to 4.05% in the previous quarter and 2.14% in the same quarter last year.Net interest income (NII), or the core income a bank earns from loans, rose marginally by 1.3% to Rs14,437.46 crore in the September quarter from Rs14,252.55 crore a year ago.The domestic net interest margin, or the difference between the yield on advances and cost of funds, declined by 27 basis points year-on-year to 3.05% from 3.32%. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Non-interest income that includes fees and commissions  increased 36% to Rs8,424.14 crore from Rs6,197.25 crore a year ago.Capital adequacy ratio for the quarter stood at 13.94%, up from 12.17% a year ago.Gross advances rose 8.11% year-on-year to Rs14.8 trillion  as of 30 September. Of this, large corporate advances were at Rs3.1 trillion, up 10.17% from last year. Loans to mid-sized corporate entities were at Rs2.05 trillion at the end of the second quarter, barely changed from the same period last year. Retail loans rose 20.42% year-on-year to Rs3.5 trillion.Deposits increased to Rs18.58 trillion as of 30 September,  from Rs16.34 trillion a year ago.Loan growth is expected to remain slow.

Under the revised terms, PVR will now add 32 screens with the acquisition, compared with the earlier estimate of 39 screens. Nonetheless, the deal closure is good news.The DT Cinemas acquisition and its organic screen addition will help PVR clock 608 and 664 screens in financial year 2017 (FY17) and financial year 2018 (FY18), respectively, according to ICICI Securities Ltd.It is expected to report ATPs (average ticket prices) of Rs.207 and Rs.218 in FY17E and FY18E, respectively, wrote analysts from ICICI Securities in a note on 31 May.The report further added that major growth in ATPs would stem from DT Cinemas screens, which operate at a superior ATP i.e. at ~15-20% premium to that of PVR. At March end, PVR had 516 screens.On the other hand, Inox Leisure Ltd plans to add 89 new screens for financial year 2017, leading to 509 screens by the year end.PVRs ATP during the past quarter had increased 8.3% from a year earlier to Rs.182, while that of Inox rose by 5.7% to Rs.167.While both the companies fared well in the seasonally weak March quarter and posted good growth in operating profit, PVRs performance was better.Further, PVRs advertising revenue growth at 19.3% looks far superior to the 2% decline in advertising revenue that Inox reported. A delay in the absorption of advertising rate hikes has taken a toll on Inoxs advertising revenue lately. Even as both the companies reported an operating profit, higher depreciation costs and finance expenses led them to post pre-tax losses.Still, the year as a whole proved to be rather good, what with movies such as Baahubali-The Beginning, Bajrangi Bhaijaan, Tanu Weds Manu Returns, Avengers, Piku, etc. performing well at the box office.The upshot: PVRs pre-tax and exceptional item profit increased to Rs.149 crore for financial year 2016 from Rs.14.6 crore for financial year 2015, a somewhat dull year for cinema performance.Similarly, the measure for Inox increased to Rs.89.5 crore from Rs.16.5 crore.What about the current financial year?Well, the year has begun well with the success of The Jungle Book and the content pipeline is looking strong.But will this year be better than the last?

0.3,"New Delhi: The dispute between the government and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) over the latters alleged production of gas from a Krishna Godavari basin reservoir it shares with state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) seems headed for a protracted battle. The oil ministry has asked for views from Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), the law ministry and in-house legal experts on whether it should proceed to recover the $1.55 billion compensation demanded from RIL while an arbitration remains pending.
				   
				The oil ministry has also sought their views on the measures that could be taken to ensure that production of gas does not decline further from RILs KG D6 block so that any move to recover the compensation from the sales revenue of gas from the KG DWN 98/3 (KG D6) block does not suffer, a person with direct knowledge of the development said on condition of anonymity. RIL reported production of 139.1 billion cubic feet of gas from the block in 2015-16.An email sent to RIL on Tuesday remained unanswered at the time of going to press.The person quoted above said that the government was merely addressing all aspects of the dispute as per the law and was not being vengeful to an investor. We are only taking steps to protect governments revenue interest in an objective manner as any government of the day will do in any given dispute. The provisions of the law will take its course, said the person.After the oil ministry raised the compensation claim on 4 November, Reliance proposed an arbitration to resolve the issue. Accordingly, the government nominated G.S. Singhvi, a former Supreme Court judge and former Competition Appellate Tribunal (Compat) chairman, as its arbitrator, Mint reported on 26 December. Singhvi, along with RILs nominee on the arbitration panel, Bernard Eder, a former high court judge in the UK, are now in the process of finalizing a third neutral umpire arbitrator for the panel.The ministry raised the compensation demand after the Justice A.P. Shah panel, which looked into ONGCs claim of gas flow between the neighbouring fields of the two companies, recommended on 31 August that RIL should compensate for the unfair enrichment it had by way of retaining the gains of gas flow into its block KG D6. The panel was appointed after the Delhi high court, on a petition from ONGC, asked the government to resolve the issue in a transparent way, keeping in mind provisions of the law and applying principles of natural justice.The panel, which lacked technical expertise on determining whether gas flowed from ONGCs block to RILs, relied upon a report by consultant DeGolyer and MacNaughton, jointly hired by the companies, to say that between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2015, about 11 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas migrated to KG D6 from adjacent fields, of which RIL benefited from 8.9 bcm. RIL in a 4 November statement said that its liability to pay compensation had not been established by any process known to law. The claim of the government is based on misreading and misinterpretation of key elements of the production sharing contract and is without precedent in the oil and gas industry, anywhere in the world RIL remains convinced of being able to fully justify and vindicate its position that the governments claim is not sustainable, the company had said then. Experts said disputes often arise on account of volatility in the energy sector as well as from multiple interpretations of the contract.The government has to ensure that investors get a reasonable return on their investments in the oil and gas sector compared to what they would get from other markets or from other industries.

				All restrictions have been removed except on savings bank account of Rs24,000 per week.

Therefore, effectively and practically today, there is no restriction. I think the process of remonetisation is near-complete. I am using the word near-complete because this Rs24,000 limit is there, he said.The emphasis will be on providing lower denomination notes. Das said the remonetisation process has reached near completion in less than 90 days of announcement of the demonetisation by the prime minister on 8 November.In less than 90 days, the whole process of remonetisation is almost complete. This speaks volumes about the way the remonetisation has been completed, he said. Earlier in the week, RBI announced lifting of restrictions on daily withdrawal of cash from current and overdraft account as well as ATMs. The central bank also promised to review the weekly limit in the near future depending on the pace of remonetisation.

-0.15,"Hindalco Industries Ltds aluminium business contributed Rs.29.1 crore to profit before interest and tax in the September quarter. It had returned a profit of Rs.253.6 crore in the June quarter. The decline can be blamed squarely on falling aluminium price realizations. Average LME (London Metal Exchange) prices have declined by 9.8% on a sequential basis during the September quarter.
				   
				But that was not all. A steep fall in regional metal premiums, which buyers pay to secure timely supplies, was an even bigger reason. According to Alcoa Inc., the Japanese metal premium was down by 47% sequentially, while Europe was down by 23.2%. The combined fall in realizations has affected Hindalcos profits.The ramp-up of its new aluminium capacity also means that initial costs are relatively higher. The company said that the Mahan smelter (Madhya Pradesh) has reached full capacity during the quarter, while the Aditya smelter (Odisha) is being ramped up. Once these stabilize, then costs too should stabilize. During the quarter, employee costs and other expenses saw significant increases.Hindalcos copper business continues to hold fort for the company. Fortunately, this business does not depend on copper prices, which have been falling, but on the treatment and refining fees earned for converting copper concentrate into copper and by-products. These fees have been relatively firm so far. That resulted in the copper business returning a profit of Rs.350 crore, up 2% sequentially.But that is not enough. The companys operating profit fell by 31.3% sequentially. After a lower depreciation charge, higher other income and lower tax outgo, its net profit declined by 3.7%. That is some consolation.The business environment for Hindalco remains tough. Aluminium prices have weakened further in this quarter. Globally, companies are looking to cut production to improve the demand-supply situation. But others, including Hindalco, are hiking production too. When aluminium (all metals, in fact) prices will bottom out is a question everyone is asking, but nobody is sure of the answer.Wait and watch is the safe strategy. For Hindalco, a key risk is if treatment and refining fees charged by its copper smelting business come under pressure. That will strain its profitability further. The next few months should give an indication of how negotiations for 2016 are panning out. On the brighter side, the company said it has extended the tenure of its project loans. That gives it more comfort in servicing its debt, while it tides over these difficult times.",2015-11-10,RpTXWXQo0yCZjjBI9LivCL,"Hindalcos copper business continues to hold fort for the company amid falling aluminium price realizations and regional metal premiums

-0.15,"CES debuted gadget hits like the VCR, CD player and Xbox over the years, but the popular consumer electronics conference also showcases a lot of technology that fails to match the hype.
				   
				Some of the top flops from 50 years of the Las Vegas show include Digital Audio Tape players, Apples Newton handheld computer and Ataris Jaguar gaming console. Here are some of the more recent disappointments from CES.1) Smart GlassesGoogle kicked off a wave of optimism about internet-connected eyewear when it unveiled Google Glass at its developer conference in April 2013. At CES in early 2014, there were a bunch on show, including the Epson Moverio BT-200 and Vergence Labs Epiphany glasses which let the wearer control drones with hand gestures. As of early 2017, there were no mainstream smart glasses selling in high volumes. Google Glass flopped. Apple Inc. is working on the technology, but hasnt released a product yet.2) 3D PrintersThis was the anointed technology at CES 2013. The CubeX from 3D Systems Inc. won a Best of CES for emerging technology that year. 3D printers have made steady progress since then, especially for industrial uses, but they arent in a lot of homes or offices. MakerBot, a pioneer in the sector that had a strong presence in 2013, has cut staff amid declining sales. Stratasys Ltd. bought MakerBot in 2013, and its share price hit a record in January 2014. The stock is down more than 75% since then. 3D Systems shares are down about the same amount in that period.3) Lily, GoPro DronesStartup Lily Robotics won a coveted CES 2016 innovation award for its autonomously steered camera drone. A working version of the gadget wasnt shown at the conference and shipping dates have been delayed. GoPro Inc. founder Nick Woodman took to the stage at the same CES to tease more information about his companys Karma drone. That gadget finally went on sale in October, but the company recalled thousands of them after they lost power. GoPro was back at CES this year showing off the Karma and the company said it will re-launch the drone later in 2017.4) HoverboardsAt CES 2016, makers of hoverboards battled over which company came up with the technology and related designs. The electric skateboards were gaining in popularity, thanks in part to celebrities like Justin Bieber posting shots of themselves zipping around on the devices. So there was a lot at stake. But things turned sour when US federal marshals raided the CES booth of a Chinese hoverboard maker. Future Motion, a Silicon Valley startup, said it invented and patented a self-balancing electric skateboard that looked strikingly similar to the ones the marshals confiscated. Less than two months later, Amazon.com Inc. and other big retailers stopped selling hoverboards after the US Consumer Product Safety Commission deemed them unsafe, saying they pose an unreasonable risk of fire if they didnt meet voluntary safety standards. No hoverboards on the market met those standards, it added at the time.5) PebblePebble Technology Corp. was the belle of the CES 2013 ball when the startup announced its smartwatch would ship in late January. The following year its Pebble Steel model made several Best of CES lists including The Verges Best Smartwatch. Alas, the company is no more. Struggling under the weight of its debt, the company sold software assets to Fitbit Inc. last month. Pebble hardware projects are no more and it isnt actively supporting existing watches. Too bad for buyers wowed by their showing at CES.6) SmartwatchesAt CES 2014, a year after Pebbles debut, dozens of smartwatches were shown. Google unveiled its Android Wear smartwatch platform a few months later, and Apple announced its Watch in September of that year. The hope was that smartwatches would be the next hot gadget to rival the smartphone. But by the third quarter of 2016, global smartwatch sales were down 52% from a year earlier, according to research firm IDC.7) The Dell Venue 8 7000 tabletCalling it the thinnest tablet in the world, CES listed Dell Inc.s Venue 8 device among its 2015 Best of Innovation Award Honorees. It was part of an attempt by Intel Corp. to get its components into more tablets and other mobile devices. The tablet featured an Intel RealSense camera and Atom processor. However, last year Dell stopped selling the tablets. Intel managed to sneak a chip into some of the latest iPhones, but the semiconductor giant still hasnt cracked mobile.

0.24,"With ease of doing business for customers becoming the new mantra for Indias state-owned ports, its not surprising to see container terminal operators, even if they are run by private firms at these ports, coming up with new initiatives to score brownie points.
				   
				Gateway Terminals India Pvt. Ltd, 74% owned by APM Terminals Management BV, the container terminal operating unit of Danish shipping and oil giant AP Moller Maersk Group A/S, has introduced what it calls continuous gate-in facility for exporters, a first in India.Gateway Terminals is the biggest of the four container terminals operating at Jawaharlal Nehru (JN) Port, Indias busiest container gateway.To put it simply, the new initiative means exporters can deliver containers at the terminal for the next shipping cycle, even when there is an existing vessel docked at the terminal for the current cycle. Other terminals close their gate-in services for the next shipping cycle for about 24-36 hours when a ship is docked till the loading and unloading process is complete for that vessel.Shipping cycles are weekly. Terminals allow container cargo for the current shipping cycle to be delivered till a particular cut-off time. Once the unloading and loading process is completed for a docked ship and only upon the vessel sailing is the gate-in facility opened for the next vessel/shipping cycle. Considering 80% of the cargo delivered still comes by road (70% of which are up-country cargo containers from the northern hinterland), this facility of continuous gate-in obviates the necessity for trucks having to park outside the terminal on the approach road, awaiting the opening of the gates for the next vessel, thus preventing congestion and reducing costs for the trade.The continuous gate-in service, according to Gateway Terminals, negates indirect costs and reduces congestion due to container-laden trucks clogging the approach roads to the port for gate opening, a common sight at JN Port for long.It takes about 378 hours and $695 for importing a cargo container through Jawaharlal Nehru Port, according to the Doing Business Report 2016 published by the World Bank.The time and cost involved in an import shipment are 115 hours and $214 on account of customs, 196 hours and $342 on port and border handling and 67 hours and $139 on document preparation.Port and border handling on the import side includes the time spent by the cargo container at container freight stations (CFS) located outside the port area which takes nearly 8-9 days at JN Port. On the import side, the average time taken in the port per se is around 36 hours at JN Port, according to the port authority.Similarly, on the cost for port and border handling which is indicated as $342, the cost for handling within JN Port is only around $60, while the remaining cost is related to CFS and other logistics activities.Exporting a cargo container through JN Port entails 149 hours and $472, according to the World Bank report. This includes 37 hours and $170 at customs, 51 hours and $198 on port and border handling and 61 hours and $104 on documentation.One of the major issues on the exports side at JN Port is the waiting time for trucks before entry into individual terminals.The reasons attributed for the long wait are that many trucks which carry factory-stuffed containers come well in advance so as not to miss the ship, and add to congestion on the roads.Factory-stuffed containers are mostly routed through CFS but some tractor trailers carrying containers do not go into the CFS and, instead, wait on the roads. At times, terminals even shut down their gates unannounced when a ship is at berth unloading and loading. These unannounced shutdowns lead to congestion at the gates and on the roads.The main reason for bringing containers well in advance to the port area is the anxiety of the exporter to ensure the container does not miss the deadline for entry into the terminal before the ship departs. There is no reliable information for planning container movement.The government has advised JN Port authorities to compress the gate window time from the current five days to four days immediately and to three days over a period of time.The continuous gate-in initiative introduced by Gateway Terminals, though laudable, raises some questions. Does this mean Gateway Terminals will not follow a cut-off time for exporters to deliver their containers at its terminal?If so, wouldnt it render the window concepta term used to describe the time slot given to a ship for docking at a terminalmeaningless.Some two decades ago, trucks carrying containers used to come in any point of time, drop the containers and go off; vessels used to come at any point of time, unload, load and sail off. This led to chaos and resulted in the introduction of the window concept globally.If there is no cut-off time at Gateway Terminals, can an exporter gate-in a container for loading on a ship that is expected, say, in three weeks? Who will pay the storage charges till the container is loaded onto the ship?Gateway Terminals says it is not collecting any extra charges for offering the continuous gate-in facility to customers. On the contrary, it says, customers are saving trucking costsinstead of waiting outside on the road, the containers are taken inside.But, there will be a cost involved in this exercise because the rate regulator for ports such as JN Port allows a free storage time of three days. After that, charges are levied depending on the duration of the stay.These days, there is enough parking space inside the terminal yard due to low volumes. And, empty containers lying in the yard are being taken out quickly because the ground rent for empties is significantly higher than laden ones.So, essentially, the continuous gate-in facility may end up transferring cost from one place (roads) to another place (terminals) unless the terminal operator decides to waive of the storage charges.But then, who would pass up an opportunity to make an extra buck in these difficult times? An exporter will now have to choose whether he prefers his container to stay on the road with the attendant costs or take the container inside the terminal, again with attendant costs. Its a trade-off. P. Manoj looks at trends in the shipping industry.",2016-08-05,RvOiLz5DfKtalapLYpECIO,"An exporter will have to choose if he prefers his container to stay on the road with the attendant costs or take the container inside the terminal, again with attendant costs

				Siemens will pay $37.25 a share in cash for Wilsonville, Oregon-based Mentor, the industrial giant said in a statement on Monday. Thats 21% above the closing price on Friday. Elliott Management Corp., which owns 8.1% of Mentors shares, backs the offer, Siemens said.Its a perfect portfolio fit to further expand our digital leadership and set the pace in the industry, chief executive officer Joe Kaeser said in the statement.The deal follows Siemenss $970 million January purchase of US computer-program maker CD-adapco of the US as Kaeser seeks to grow the digital business as part of a retreat from consumer-oriented products to focus on industrial applications. Mentor is the biggest acquisition announced by the Munich-based company since it agreed to buy Dresser-Rand Group Inc. for $7.6 billion. For its part, Mentor was under pressure to increase shareholder value from activist investor Elliott, which doubled its stake to 8.1% in September.Mentor shares surged 19% to $36.52 in pre-market trading before US exchanges opened. Siemens rose 1.5% to 109.75 as of 11:31 am in Frankfurt, extending the years gain to 22%.The agreed price isnt overly expensive and will make Siemens more competitive in the industrial software business, German brokerage Baader Helvea said in a note to clients. The value of the transaction includes net debt.The purchase is expected to boost Siemenss earnings before interest and taxes by more than 100 million ($108 million) within four years of closing and will contribute to earnings per share within three years, the company said. Siemenss digital factory unit, which will house Mentor after the deal closes, contributed 10.2 billion to Siemens 79.6 billion of revenue in the financial year through September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Mentor sells software and hardware used to design electronics for the semiconductor, automotive and transportation industries. The company reported a loss of $10 million in the six months ended 31 July, compared with profit of $21 million in the same period last year, according to an 18 August regulatory filing. The company forecast revenue of $1.22 billion for the 12 months through January.Under Kaeser, Siemens has pushed deeper into software applications that are crucial to run its industrial equipment. At the same time, Siemens is simplifying its sprawling portfolio, and the company announced last week that it wants to list its health-care subsidiary, among the biggest makers in the world of diagnostics and imaging equipment.Elliott, run by billionaire Paul Singer, said when it raised its stake it saw numerous opportunities to boost Mentors deeply undervalued shares and had started talks with the companys management and board.The agreement comes almost six years after activist investor Carl Icahn unsuccessfully pushed for a sale of Mentor. He bid $17 a share in February 2011 for Mentor in an attempt to lure other suitors for the software maker. Icahn, who was Mentors largest shareholder at the time of his bid, sold a chunk of his holding back to the company at $18.12 a share in February of this year, and he sold his remaining stock in May.

The agency has named two bank officials, working at the Kashmere Gate branch in Delhi, Vineet Gupta (branch head) and Shobhit Sinha (operations head) who with active connivance of a private person Rajeev S Kushwaha deposited huge amount of demonetised currency to the tune of Rs40 crore of various firms and companies run by Kushwaha for a huge commission and converted it into monetised form like (real time gross settlement) RTGS transfers and gold.The case was first detected by Delhi Police after it intercepted three persons with about Rs3.7 crore cash in old notes in front of the Axis Bank branch in November last year. The ED took cognisance of the police FIR and slapped money laundering charges against the accused. The trio was arrested by it in December last year under PMLA and are currently in judicial custody. Detailing their modus operandi, the agency said, the trio used to deposit money after banking hours at around 6:00 PM The money deposited in these accounts was transferred to different accounts within minutes to different companies through Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS). HDFC Bank increases cash transaction fees on savings accountsNo suspicious transaction reports (STRs) were filed by the bank officials and the depoits were made without authorisation, bypassing banking formalities. ED said, It all started when following demonetisation (on November 8, 2016) people with illegal money began converting their old currency notes into gold/legal tender. These bullion traders wanted payments in RTGS/transfer of money through banking channel for the sale of gold as old currency was not accepted. Some of such elements contacted Kushwaha and his associates for this purpose. Kushwaha was having various fictitious companies/firms namely Ms Himalaya International, Ms RD Trader and Ms Beagle Marketing and Ms Sunrise Trading. The chargesheet further said: They (Kushwaha and others) contacted Gupta and Sinha to get special facilities to put the old currency into the banking system through their fictitious/shell companies having current account in Kashmere Gate branch by offering huge commission. Kushwaha and his associates collected old currency charging huge commission from various people and infused that money into the banking system and acted against the law. The amount so deposited in these companies account was transferred to various bullion traders for procurement of gold which was given to the person who had given them their illegal money in old currency, it said. The agency had also attached assets belonging to Gupta and others worth Rs3.4 crore. ED probe had also found that huge amount of money was transferred through RTGS to some shell companies including in a case where the Director of a firm was a petty labourer living in a slum in Anna Nagar jhuggi camp in the national capital. It was also found that directors of other shell companies were also persons of no means, the ED had said earlier.",2017-02-03,RvtmwWTchcn27Lxe4mMKJP,The agency filed the chargesheet against the Axis Bank staff  before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act court ,both,21:11,Note ban: ED files 1st money laundering chargesheet against Axis Bank staff
-0.31,"New Delhi: In a setback to Cairn India, the Delhi high court on Tuesday rejected its plea seeking permission to export surplus crude from Barmer oil fields in Rajasthan.
				   
				Under a production sharing contract (PSC) between Cairn India, a Vedanta group company, and state explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC), it could sell surplus crude oil only to government and its nominees.The terms of the PSC allowed Cairn get 70% of crude from the well while the state-owned company would get 30%. The plea is bereft of merits, stands dismissed, said Justice Manmohan who pronounced the order.He added that company could resort to dispute resolution mechanism under the PSC to address the issue of export of surplus crude.The oil and gas exploration company through the hearings had maintained that it should be allowed to export its surplus crude as private domestic refineries in India were not offering competitive prices with respect to the international market.It said that they were agreeable to offering the domestic players in the country the first option to buy the crude, but at international prices.Due to neither the government, nor its nominees or public sector refineries willing to purchase its crude, Cairn contended that it was forced to sell to two private refineriesReliance and Essar, at a loss since these prices were not internationally competitive.The Centre had reiterated that the countrys no-export policy on crude as long as the country does not attain self sufficiency could not be changed.Additional Solicitor General, Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre told the court crude oil per se was not allowed to be exported. He said that India had a total refining capacity of 223 million tonnes. However, at present only 38 million tonnes of crude oil was available. It would not be in the interest of the country to export crude, he argued.Cairn India, however, argued that the countrys foreign trade policy did not bar export of crude.",2016-10-18,S3WuY3SsNVQ7NJkpCXiXvN,Delhi HC cites a production sharing contract between Cairn India and ONGC to bar the Vedanta group firm from exporting surplus crude to any third party,competitor,11:36,Cairn India cannot export surplus crude from Barmer oilfields: Delhi HC

Against an expectation of a 10-19% drop, revenue rose 10% from a year ago on higher lint (seed) sales. Still, the firm posted a loss of about Rs.7 crore as expenses rose sharply.
				   
				Employee costs doubled from a year ago on fresh hiring. Other expenses saw a sharp rise as the company provided for doubtful debts. According to C. Mithun Chand, whole-time director at Kaveri Seed, with the latest write-off, the company has provided for most of the doubtful debts. Trade receivables halved from a year ago.January-March is a small quarter for seeds companies. A disproportionate part of the business is done in the first nine months of a fiscal year. That said, Kaveri Seed did well to reduce trade receivables. Aided by a better monsoon forecast, it expects 2016-17 to be a better year. Last fiscal year, revenue fell 23% on weak demand and market share losses.In the current fiscal year, the firm expects the non-cotton seeds business to do better. The segment, which includes maize, paddy and millet, is estimated to grow 20-25% on better farm gate price outlook, Chand said.The management also expects the cotton seeds business, which generates around 60% of Kaveri Seeds revenue, to do better than the year gone by. It is confident of gaining market share in Maharashtra. Acreages in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are estimated to fall due to discouragement of cotton crops by the state governments. But helped by marketing efforts and credit facilities, Kaveri Seed plans to gain market share in these states also.Gaining market share in the cotton seeds business will not be easy though. Competition is fierce. Also, our channel checks suggest that it is going to be pretty difficult for Kaveri to regain market share this year as Jadoo (Kaveris Bt cotton brand) is now a 7-8 year old hybrid. Hence, we await clarity on market share revival, a domestic brokerage firm said in a note to clients. Apart from cotton seed sales, investors will also have to keep an eye on court rulings on Bt cotton royalty.

-0.64,"Singapore: The Indian start-up ecosystem is quite fragmented, and has a lot of players in the business-to-consumer space (B2C) space, but it requires a lot more focus on business-to-business (B2B), said Nipun Mehrotra, vice-president, growth initiatives, IBM India & south Asia. There have been some big exits in the consumer segment with the likes of Myntra, Jabong and Freecharge etc and with more and more international brands venturing in to the Indian market the consumer start-up industry will witness further churn and consolidation.

				Edited excerpts: This year is shaping up to be perhaps the roughest ever for Indias technology companies. How do you think Indian start-up ecosystem should prepare themselves going forward?The startp-up ecosystem in India is evolving and as per the latest report by Nasscom- ZINNOV, India will be home to 10,500 start-ups by 2020. However, there is still a long way to go for the start-ups. On one hand, the start-ups need to come up with very deeply differentiated business models which will add value to their customers, and at the same time make their processes efficient and frugal - for example, leverage existing API (application programming interface) s as much as possible to build products rather than developing products from scratch. They need to make their investments work twice as hard to build their business in 2017 and beyond. Another example of things that can help is to be very user focused when they build their business vs being product feature-focused. Alignment to the end user is critical at an early stage and start-ups must embed design thinking aspect as they build their product.When it comes to global ecosystems, London is the first thing on ones mind when you talk fintech. What do you think of the fintech opportunity in India?The fintech industry has gained momentum in India since the beginning of 2015. The industry witnessed the emergence of numerous fintech start-ups, incubators, and investments from public and private investors. The key enablers in the industry like government policies, regulatory framework coupled with various banks like ICICI and AXIS coming up with their accelerators to work along with entrepreneurs has helped to drive the momentum in India. The fintech start-ups are further leveraging various government initiatives like Jan Dhan Yojna, Aadhaar, and Digital India and we will see a lot of innovation happening in this space in the coming years. While there is a lot of growth opportunity for this sector, the companies also need to look at greater collaboration between various players and amalgamate learnings and entrepreneurial experiences for further growth of this sector. There should also be a cohesive fintech environment built for complete infrastructure penetration. We are witnessing some innovation in the P2P (peer-to-peer) lending, robo advisory, bank-in-a-box, security and biometrics areas which are treading fast towards mass market implementation, with technology like blockchain just marking its entry with a promising future for the fintech companies.What is your take on Indian governments approach to the start-up ecosystem in India?The government has launched many progressive programs to address the requirements of the start-up ecosystem in India. (With) Start Up India, along with programmes like Make in India, the government is giving a further boost to the start-up community. Government is also focusing on making start-ups leverage new age technologies and has set up National Initiative for Development and Harnessing Innovations (NIDHI), an umbrella programme which aims to nurture ideas and innovations in the start-up ecosystem. ...friendly policies like waiving income tax on their profit for the first three years, a simple exit policy, fast tracking of the patent applications, 80% exemption in patent fee, self-certification based compliance system etc are bold move to get more young minds in the start-up space. There can be more work done to support the growth of start-ups in India by driving structured collaboration between government and corporates. We believe that with emergence of new technologies like cognitive, cloud, IoT (Internet of Things), design thinking etc. and governments push for R&D (research and development) the startup ecosystem can transform the innovation culture and place India on a high growth trajectory.Exits are still an issue in India, when do you see them happening?We believe the Indian start-up ecosystem is quite fragmented and while we have a lot of B2C start-ups, we do require more focus on B2B and on start-ups that are differentiated by IP or deep tech. Start-ups also need to focus on building a scalable business, with an international outlook and catering to standards that make them attractive to large global tech companies or global clients. There is a need for uniqueness and use of deep technology to distinguish from B2C models. We believe for exits to ramp up, there needs to be a concerted approach by all players in the ecosystem and to possibly replicate the success that Israelas one examplehas seen. We do see the government being aligned towards helping start-ups not just grow but also help in their exit process. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Bill 2015, tabled in the Lok Sabha last December, has provisions for fast track and/or voluntary closure of businesses. With the shelf life of Internet-born companies among consumers being low for various reasons like competitive market, too many options, cashback and lucrative benefits, we think its about time that we will witness more exits happening soon. There have been some big exits in the consumer segment with the likes of Myntra, Jabong and Freecharge etc and with more and more international brands venturing into the Indian market the consumer start-up industry will witness further churn and consolidation. We definitely see a huge opportunity for B2B start-ups to grow and be a larger value addition to corporates.Globally, IBM has put capital into venture capital fundsyouve invested in over 50 fundsbut, weve not seen IBM do that in India and south-east Asia. Why is that so?Every start-up has two major requirementsresources and capital. There is no dearth of capital for the right idea and the right team, and there are many investors who are providing this. Where we can differentially add, tremendous value is from giving the much-needed strategic and technology mentorship which further helps the start-up to leverage their money in the right direction. IBM provides access to clients, access to deep technology engagement with our labs and access to mentoring and all of this without the startups giving up any equity for it.In India, you have partnered with Kalaari and Indian Angel Network to work with the start-upsbut this is for mentoring, training and educating and getting them to cloud and cognitive technologies at an early stage. How much leverage do VCs even have in influencing such decisions for their portfolio companies? We are partnering with a select few investors who are actively engaged in supporting and mentoring start-ups in incubating their ideas. At IBM, we believe that we can add value from our deep enterprise technology, our huge spend on research and probably the worlds best access to enterprise clients to help these start-ups and also VCs. We are looking beyond selling our products and solutions to becoming essential to the ecosystem through a whole range of collaborative activitiesincluding helping their portfolio companies get access to IBMs senior leadership team, by jointly working with clients, through activities like design thinking etc with Kalaari and Indian Angel Network.In areas like cloud, start-ups have several competitive optionswhat makes IBM different?IBM has been committed to the overall development of the start-up community and provides startups with free cloud credits on IBM Cloud Solutions worth $24,000 for one year helping emerging companies. We further help them to harness the power of IBM cloud, as well as connect them to IBMs vast global network of clients, consultants, innovation centers, and developers. Several start-ups across India are tapping into IBM cloud to run critical applications and grow their businesses. Both IBM Bluemix, a hybrid cloud development platform and Softlayer, a cloud infrastructure platform, have received a good response in terms of adoption from Indian startups.For start-ups, IBM does not enjoy the mind recall when it comes to looking for potential partners/ How are you working to change that, and given the pace at which IBM operates, can you ever adapt to the requirements, demands, flexibilities that the start-ups require?Indian start-ups have the quality and value to help IBM itself remain agile...so part of this focus is also to help IBMs employeestechnical, sales, business and even functional staff like HR and financelearn and remain abreast with trends. We believe our employees need to stay close to the market and where it is headed and helping in their personal and official capacity to mentor start-ups and help them to innovate. We believe in co-creating and co-innovating with the start-ups and we have an IBM Garage in Bangalore wherein we will have workshops and get start-up get access to a lot of our enterprise customers to build products together.",2016-11-11,SL6pCMJg6ebL1rewMDvayL,"There is a huge opportunity for B2B start-ups to grow, says Nipun Mehrotra, vice-president, growth initiatives, IBM India & south Asia",both,11:03,Indian start-ups need to focus more on B2B space: Nipun Mehrotra
-0.49,"It is the Monday after Christmas, and I am meeting Ashish Bhasin, chairman and chief executive officer, Dentsu Aegis Network (DAN), South Asia, for lunch at San-Qi at Mumbais Four Seasons hotel. Arriving a few minutes early, I am reminded of the long boozy lunches the admen were always having in that epochal TV series Mad Men. When Bhasin walks in, a few moments later, it is with the air of easy familiarity. Bhasin has the build of a prosperous Punjabi man and the sartorial style of an adman, in his beige suit and maroon tie.
				   
				The 52-year-old says he is brash; he exults in it. I have announced that the Dentsu Aegis Network wants to be the No.2 player in the country by 2017, says Bhasin, who believes in putting pressure on himself to perform by going public with his objectives. So far, the strategy seems to have worked. In 2008, Bhasin left Lintas to join a bare-bones operation at Aegis India. Eight years later, he presides over DAN with 2,800 employees and revenue of Rs3,500 crore in the year ended December 2016.The last few years have seen Dentsu Aegis on an acquisition spree, buying companies as if they were candy. From digital marketing companies like Webchutney, Communicate 2 and Happy Creative, to public relations firm Perfect Relations and, most lately, user interface and user experience design company Fractal Ink Design Studio, Dentsu Aegis has been on a roll when it comes to the business of buying.If you are not growing, you are dying. Acquisition is something where when you talk to 20 people, four-five may come into the final consideration set. So at any point of time we are talking to four-five people. Its like a courtship, says Bhasin. He says it takes him about a year to complete an acquisition. More than the money, its the chemistry with the management team that matters. I spend a lot of time interacting with the people, across several locations. If they are too full of themselves, you know early on that this guy is never going to be a team player, says Bhasin. He says he has let good businesses go because he felt the promoters were talented but cavalier, like cowboys. Many of Bhasins learnings came from his 20 years in Lintas. When I joined Lintas (in 1988) as a management trainee, I used to be the envy of my peers. I was working on the Liril soap account, and one of our key tasks was to find the new Liril girl. We had to hang around in colleges and had to attend the auditions of bikini-clad models in a bathroom with a shower, he reminiscences.The Lintas days, where Bhasin shot commercials in curfew-struck Burma (now Myanmar), and managed everything from the health of bathrooms to the health of the balance sheet at its Chennai office, make for a fascinating backstory. But a waiter is hovering discreetly in the background. So we break to order lunch. Bhasin is a regular at San-Qi,  and recommends green Thai chicken curry and sautéed prawns, with a side serving of rice. We place the order and move on to trends in media.The whole industry is focusing on ad shots and angles. That is all very important, but guys, the cheese is moving. I dont know why people in advertising are blind, he says. Media is no longer the print and broadcast medium it used to be. The power has shifted to digital. Today people are still spending Rs3 crore to make an ad. But there are digital agencies that make very good ads for Rs30,000 and (they are) getting more views than you are getting on your Rs3 crore ad, says BhasinOur food arrives. The Thai curry is bland in a pleasing way, and the prawns are bathed in a delicate tomato gravy. No onions, Bhasin comments, as the waiter spoons out our individual helpings. That done, we return to the business of media, and to the nuts and bolts of managing a growing organization.Adding employees and acquisitions to DAN has meant that Bhasin has also had to buy or rent real estate. The Bengaluru office recently inaugurated a brand new DAN House building in Koramangala. I am a big believer in co-location; I like to have all my people together, he says, adding that he puts great store by interactions with his employees. There are no walls in my office, there is a glass partition for sound, but everybody can see everything. My email ID is known to everybody and I encourage them to write to me. Some of the best ideas come from the youngest employees, who pick up competitive information as well as knowledge of new trends. The other knowledge source of new trends has always been travel. Ï went to MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology); I went to Tokyo to see the latest advances in AI (artificial intelligence) and robotics. I am constantly keeping myself updated and shaking up my guys. Wake up, this is reality!The constant travel can be trying for his family. Yet Bhasins son Abhinay, 24, likes advertising and would like to make a career in it. His 16-year-old daughter Abhilasha plays squash for India. Wife Mayuri, a classmate from St Xaviers College in Mumbai, worked as a lecturer and then with American Express in Mumbai. Bhasin himself did his bachelors in science (zoology and biochemistry) and then a masters in business administration from Mumbais Sydenham Institute of Management Studies, Research and Entrepreneurship Education.The family likes to travel together, going on cruises, wildlife safaris, or just to their holiday home in Lonavla. There hasnt been a lot of that in the last few years though, for Bhasin hasnt managed to take time off. Its almost 3. Bhasin orders a kulfi and I take a cappuccino. And we continue our conversation.Bhasin is clearly a man on a mission. It burns me when I see any part of a clients business going out, either because they are sharing it with other agencies or because I dont have a service to offer, he says. He is determined to make DAN No.2 in the business, ahead of Interpublic Group and second only to WPP.

-0.72,"Since 1 April, the BSE FMCG Indexs gains have been just shy of the broader markets. That should give some clue of how the June quarter has panned out for makers of FMCGshort for fast-moving consumer goods, or packaged consumer goods. While thats nothing to write home about, nobodys expecting anything dramatic to happen. Morgan Stanley has downgraded the sector, saying it will continue to tail the broader market, according to a 24 September report in The Economic Times.
				   
				In the June quarter, many firms reported urban demand continued to be weak and rural growth continued to slow. Hindustan Unilever Ltds domestic consumer business reported a volume growth of 4%, the same as in the March quarter. Pricing pressure continued to be visible in its soaps business, mainly responsible for pulling down value sales growth. Others did not fare too well either. Dabur India Ltds volume growth was 4% against 7% in the March quarter. If volume growth did not impress, pricing pressures meant sales in value terms, too, was under pressure.However, raw material costs continued to be in their favour, as both food and non-food commodity prices remained low. Also, firms cut back on direct advertising, which led to a lower advertising to sales ratio. Instead, they passed on the cost savings in the form of price cuts or volume discounts, in a bid to drive sales growth and protect market share. Lower input costs and the cut in advertising costs meant most firms saw margins improve although the absolute level of profit growth itself was nothing to get excited about. ITC Ltds results were slightly different. Its volume growth improved, probably because the excise duty hikes in the FY17 budget were relatively moderate. Its consumer products business also did well, with sales rising by 9.5%.There are some silver linings. Monsoon rains have been good, which is expected to have a lag effect on rural demand. Among the events that were eagerly awaited, the hike in central government pay has happened and the goods and services tax will be rolled out in FY18. These are all boosters. The only thing thats missing from the mix is a revival in demand for consumer goods.",2016-10-09,Sb9pnv23k4I3M8K5uGqtUO,"Raw material costs continued to be in their favour, as both food and non-food commodity prices remained low",competitor,23:12,Consumer goods: slow growth remains a bugbear

				The launch of high-speed telecom services by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in September prompted Swedish telecom equipment and network services provider Ericsson AB to fast-track the roll-out of its 4G network.Jios launch definitely accelerated the development of high bit-rate mobile broadband. Without Jio, we wouldnt have seen such a quick roll-out of 4G. It would have happened a little bit more slowly, said Paolo Colella, head for the India region at Ericsson.We have already seen the 4G wave happening in many of the Western countries. In the Far East, China, Korea (and) Japan have already invested heavily in building up infrastructure. Jio has contributed to the acceleration and aligning of India to the rest of the big economies, Colella added.The limited spread of wireline fixed infrastructure in India has led to limited usage of broadband. As the country moves to 4G, there is expected to be massive demand for smartphones.We are anticipating by 2020 we will have at least 800 million smartphones in the market, so the Internet, for Indian people, is mobile. That is a major difference, Colella said.(The other difference is) the industry was not predicting to have Android phones at $40 per unit at the end of 2016, probably expecting it to happen in at least 12 months, if not 18 months further, he added.True Software Scandinavia AB, which makes the Truecaller mobile app to identify incoming calls through a crowd-sourced database, is another Swedish company that has gained from the Jio launch.The number of Truecaller users on the Jio network is already three times that of any other carrier, its co-founder Alan Mamedi said.We see that Reliance Jio right now is three times bigger than other carriers for us, as new users are joining every day. It is not that users from other carriers are droppingthey actually continue to grow. So, the trend we are seeing is that more people get connected for the first time because it is affordable, which is very interesting, Mamedi said.Mamedi added that Reliance Jio will remain a game-changer even after the expiry of free services offer since the tariffs are 10 times cheaper than the competitor.Truecaller, which entered India in 2009, struggled in the initial years as the data market had not developed, and found its feet only after the widespread adoption of 3G and 4G services.Mamedi said as more people use 4G services, it will give tools to smart people to create something magical, driving more start-ups.Home-grown mobile handset manufacturer Lava Mobiles is another company that has gained from the Jio launch. The company hopes widespread 4G adoption will help double its market share to 20% by 2020.In the operator sector, they are doing disruption, but this disruption will increase the operator business also, pushing it to double.

				The government was expected to reduce the cess on crude oil production; but the degree of change has left investors disappointed. Besides, there are other worries. While low crude oil prices result in a lower subsidy burden, analysts point out that related gains are insignificant, compared with the far larger downside from lower prices.Benefits from lower oil subsidy dont exist for ONGC below the crude price of $50 a barrel, say analysts from HDFC Securities Institutional Securities. In fact, it raises concerns about (a) lower profits from joint ventures and ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), and (2) falling domestic gas prices, according to the brokerage firm. A muted price regime will further reduce the chances of an early ramp-up of volumes, which have been flat for nearly a decade, pointed out HDFC Securities in a 2 March report.The budget blow pertained to the cess on crude oil production, which was changed from Rs.4,500 per tonne to a 20% ad valorem rate. The markets were expecting a 10% ad valorem rate. As the chart alongside shows, the benefit isnt noteworthy based on the revised rate.Meanwhile, ONGCs December quarter performance was adversely affected on account of a huge impairment loss.

				India has traditionally been a net exporter of fuel oil, the residue oil left after initial crude refining that is typically used in shipping and power generation. That is about to change. Three state-run energy firms  Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum  plan to spend $20 billion on refinery expansions to add units by 2022 that would process fuel oil into gasoline and diesel, boosting their output to meet growing local demand for transport fuels.Our fuel oil production will be less because everywhere we are going for residue upgrades, said B. Ashok, chairman of the countrys biggest refiner Indian Oil Corp (IOC).Private refiners Reliance Industries and Essar Oil have already invested heavily to build advanced refineries which produce gasoline at the expense of fuel oil.With state refiners now doing the same, India will soon have to sharply raise imports of fuel oil, two traders that participate in the market said. Indias net fuel oil exports averaged 109,000 tonnes from April to September, according to the countrys Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell, and the traders estimate this could flip into a need to raise fuel oil imports as early as late 2017.As a result, the price difference between diesel and fuel oil could narrow further from its current $17.61 a barrel, as Indian shipping fuel demand rises with the governments thrust on the coastal movement of cargoes, considered more cost efficient than road transport.Already, gasoil and fuel oil differentials have started shrinking from about $30 three years ago to $16-$18 now and it is likely to narrow further as refiners are destroying fuel oil to produce gasoil and gasoline, said S. Thangapandian, director at Gulf Petrochem.Indian refiners expansion plans almost coincide with changing shipping fuel norms from 2020 requiring the use of low-sulphur fuels.IOC is the biggest expansion investor, planning to spend Rs50,000 crore ($7.48 billion) by 2022 to raise its refining capacity by about 30% to 2.08 million barrels per day (bpd) including expanding its Panipat refinery in northern India to about 400,000 to 500,000 bpd.HPCL and BPCL plan to spend $11.25 billion to expand refineries and install fuel oil upgrading units, halting fuel oil output in almost all plants.

0.49,"Hong Kong: An Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) deal to cut oil output at a meeting this month is looking increasingly unlikely, with failure warranting prices in the low-$40s, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
				   
				The lack of progress on implementing production quotas and the growing discord between Opec producers suggests a declining probability of reaching a deal on 30 November, Goldman analysts including Damien Courvalin wrote in a note dated 31 October.Opec is due to meet in Vienna to implement the first supply cuts in eight years and get other producers from outside of the group to join in the action, including Russia. Brent crude extended losses below $50 a barrel on Monday after weekend talks failed to yield concrete details on an accord to reduce the global crude surplus and stabilize prices.The lack of an agreement so far has pushed oil prices sharply lower, with weakening oil fundamentals warranting oil prices in the low $40s a barrel in our view if Opec is unable to deliver a convincing agreement, the Goldman analysts wrote.Even if the fear of slumping oil prices prompts the group to hammer out an accord, the probability of the deal successfully reducing inventories is low, the bank said. Rising October Opec production and a faster ramp up of new non-Opec projects have reduced the odds that an agreement translates into a decent draw in inventories during the first half of 2017, it said, estimating average Opec output at about 34.2 million barrels a day last month.While the probability of a cut being announced and the odds of it successfully reducing stockpiles have declined over the past week in Goldmans view, Opecs most senior official said the organization and other major oil producers are on course to deliver a deal that will temper the global oversupply.Committed membersAll of Opecs 14 members as well as erstwhile rivals such as Russia are committed to finalizing the agreement, Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo said on Monday in a Bloomberg Television interview.

				It wasnt the companys 1.8% sales growth in FY16, because that was not much of a surprise, as the management had indicated as much. What shocked investors is its sales growth projection for FY17. An 8-10% sales growth is not what they expected, and even a proposed share buyback did little to lift spirits.In fact, the companys March quarter numbers were quite good. It has been selling its generic version of cancer drug Gleevec in the US market since February, and will be the sole generic product for six months. That allows it to earn substantial revenues and profits in this period. Thats why US formulation sales were up by 22.2% sequentially in the March quarter. Growth will be good in the June quarter as well, when the full impact of the launch will be felt and will taper September quarter onwards.This launch has helped Sun Pharma overcome a challenging US generic market, due to price competition, consolidation among customers (institutions that procure and sell drugs to patients) and supply constraints. Supply constraints are mainly due to remediation efforts at Halol to make it compliant again with US FDAs standards.Sales growth in India was up by 16.7% while that in emerging markets and rest of the world markets was slower (affected by currency volatility and supply constraints).Sun Pharmas profitability improved, up by 2.4 percentage points sequentially, part of which can be attributed to sales of generic Gleevec. The profitability improvement looks dramatic, over a year ago, but that was partly due to charges related to the merger of Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd in the March 2015 quarter.Is Sun Pharmas management being too cautious? They got their previous guidance right, adding credibility to the new guidance. They have also factored in the Halol facility coming back into play some time during the fiscal year. If not, investors could have factored this in as a surprise. In India, a decline in the Wholesale Price Index has affected price increases for FY17 of medicines under price control. Also, the ban on fixed dose combinations may affect growth to an extent.On top of this, the management said it expects research and development expenses to be 9% of sales in 2016-17, compared with 8.3% in 2015-16. What could cause a surprise, therefore, are factors mostly not in its control. One could be, if the Halol facility inspection gets clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration earlier than expected, and improved supplies lead to better sales growth. A more stable foreign currency environment in developing markets can be another positive factor. Positive news flows on its research programmes is yet another factor. But these are all known unknowns, to paraphrase former US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld. What is new is Sun Pharmas guidance.

The September quarter saw Hindustan Unilever Ltds sales volume decline 1%, as an increase in soap prices and withdrawal of promotions led to a decline in volumes. Oral care continued to disappoint, but others such as skin care, hair care and cosmetics did well.The silver lining about raw material prices increasing is that the bigger firms can manage this situation better than the smaller, unorganized ones. Godrej Consumer Products Ltds India business reported good sales growth as its household insecticides business offset a weak performance in soaps. Dabur Ltd, however, reported a 2.4% increase in sales although volume growth was 4.5%.ITC Ltds cigarettes business continued to do well, benefiting from a more moderate increase in taxes in FY17, with sales rising 7% in the September quarter, better than the 6% increase in the first quarter.

What is it? The effect of the notes ban on gross domestic product (GDP) growth in FY17, as estimated in the Economic Survey presented to Parliament on Tuesday.Why is it important? The first official acknowledgement of demonetisations impact on the economy revises a baseline growth of 7% down to 6.5-6.75%. The Central Statistics Office had not figured in the cash crunch when giving out its estimate of 7.1% earlier this month. The government took potshots at and challenged unofficial estimates, as most have factored in a larger impact of demonetisation on GDP. It included the International Monetary Fund, which forecast the withdrawal of 86% of the currency value in November, would result in a growth of 6.6%, down a full percentage from its October estimate. Tell me more: GDP growth in FY18 is expected to be between 6.75% and 7.5%, still lower than FY16s 7.6%. The government also admitted the GDP estimate would not capture the effect of the cash shortage on the informal sector, the largest employer in the country. $130,000What is it?

By removing the H1B minimum wage of $60,000, constant since 1989, and more than doubling it for the employer to be exempt from non-displacement and recruitment assessment requirements, the Act could strain the coffers of US-based IT clients. It would lead to not just a rethinking of how many local employees to replace with on-site Indian staff, but also see IT companies mull more expensive US hires or digital delivery from India. Tell me more: The Act would also reserve 20% of the annual H1B visas for small and start-up employers, while removing the per country limit for employment-based immigrant visas.5%What is it?

Even though the iconic characters generate around $30 million, licensed in over 100 countries, Iconixs decision to sell could be the result of a large customerUS insurance company Metlifedropping them after 30 years of use as mascots. This could be a major opening into the over $144 billion US licenced merchandise market (the biggest in the world) for keen investors. Peanuts, created by Charles Schulz, still counts Nestle, Zara and Hallmark as its licensees.

-0.25,"New Delhi: Director general of hydrocarbons Atanu Chakraborty is presiding over the transition to a new regulatory regime for Indias hydrocarbon pursuits aimed at wooing investors with liberal terms when the global oil and gas industry is sailing through a painful phase of low prices. 
				   
				In an interview, Chakraborty said steps will be taken to reduce disputes in the sector and to make the terms for producing unconventional and difficult to extract fuels as investor-friendly as possible. Edited excerpts:Will India be able to cut import dependence on oil and gas by 10% as planned, considering cooking gas consumption and its import is rising?The Ujjwala programme (of distributing LPG without upfront payment to the poor) is part of a shift towards using cleaner fuel and improvement in the quality of life, which is bound to happen. The demand for fuel on account of this has been captured in the consumption growth of fossil fuels. We have to produce that much extra over and above what can be produced on a business as usual scenario. We are looking at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 5.6%. Year on year growth has been almost 11% in 2014-15. The planned 10% reduction in import dependence by 2022 is called for to make us reasonably strategically secure. To achieve that, we need to increase acreage (under exploration and production). We have launched the auction of the discovered small fields this year, after a gap of about six years. In the last two years, fuel price volatility was a reason not to go ahead with the offer of blocks. The blocks currently on offer are relatively small and have many hydrocarbon discoveries so that investors do not have to spend a lot on exploration. There are other incentives too (such as pricing and marketing freedom and duty free import of equipment). The idea is to incentivize investments and to add to overall production. Having more players in the market will increase competition and efficiency in the industry.With global energy firms now cutting back on their investments, the auction of small discovered fields is going to be a test of their appetite for further investments, isnt it?Under the new hydrocarbon exploration licensing policy (HELP), pricing and marketing freedom is given to gas produced from deep-water, high pressure and high temperature areas. Also, the new royalty structure favours investors. Under the revenue share regime, which replaces profit sharing prescribed in the earlier licensing policy, governments share remains the same (as a percentage of revenue), which gives investors the comfort and incentive to produce more and benefit more in absolute terms. With stable policies, robust economic growth and improvement of our ranking in ease of doing business, the country risk for energy firms is very low. We have to leverage it to get investments and then hold their hands to ensure that they get access to market quickly. We have also ensured that they get the processing facilities of ONGC and Oil India Ltd on a commercial basis. There is no gas utilization policy, the entire market for gas is open to producers. People do talk about other incentives in the case of shale gas. Perhaps we will again revisit the regime to see what more can be offered for production of tight oil and shale gas. We need to tap all these resources simultaneously. Increasing productivity and acreage under exploration and getting to difficult reservoirs is broadly the contours of the strategy. Auction of the small discovered field is the first step. The response to the roadshows has been tremendous. As we learn from the process, if we need to tweak our offering, we certainly will do it in a transparent way. Nothing is cast in stone.What is the strategy on unconventional fuels like gas hydrates and shale gas?In the east coast, we are working together with Japan and the US Geological Survey to extract gas from gas hydrates. It is still at a research stage and we have to reach a stage where the molecules are stable. While tight oil and shale gas are within the realm of possibility, gas hydrate has to reach a stage when we can think of commercial production. Considering our reliance on import, we need to be there on all these emerging areas from day one so that we can monetize any upside at the earliest. The gas market in India is rapidly developing with new transmission lines coming up, including for city gas distribution and for fertilizer plants. The share of gas in the national hydrocarbon basket is expected to go up from about 7% now to 25% in some years. In the case of Gujarat, it is already 25%.What are the tax breaks available for gas producers?Income-tax exemption no longer exists for gas, but import of equipment enjoys customs duty exemption.Price volatility in a highly capital intensive and risky sector such as energy, could in no time bankrupt a successful company. Disputes in such a scenario is normal as we have seen in the past. How do you plan to address this?There would be differences in perception, and hence disputes, in big contracts such as those for natural resources. We have to continuously fine tune the resolution mechanisms. We have made many corrections in the production sharing regime and we keep improving the existing system. If the contractor wants to produce hydrocarbons, the government will always help them. Those who are well intentioned, will always do well. We have a large number of fields which have in the last 20 years added to our energy basket. As a regulator, we want every energy company to bring investments and produce more. We will be taking many steps to further improve regulations.What are the specific areas you would be working on to reduce disputes?Communicating right at the time of auctioning the fields, the different aspects of executing the contract and the issues where perceptions could differ between parties, can eliminate avoidable disputes. We keep examining the models elsewhere that could help in reducing the time required for dispute resolution. For example, invoking force majeure provisions in a contract is one area around which many disputes take place. Creating awareness about this among investors is important. A lot of education is required on contract management by the parties. In the road shows for the discovered small fields, we tried to educate businesses about these aspects. We are also thinking of having a portal to facilitate communication among stakeholders that will help in reducing disputes.",2016-10-13,TbkBDUN0P9dE8WGxSKoC0N,"Steps will be taken to reduce disputes in the energy sector, says director general of hydrocarbons Atanu Chakraborty ",competitor,01:41,The entire gas market is open to producers: Atanu Chakraborty
-0.25,"If the Narendra Modi government is serious about transforming 11 of the 12 ports owned by the Indian government into landlord ports to run them more efficiently under a new law, it would be left with no choice but to privatize the cargo berths run by the state itself.
				   
				But this would be an extremely difficult choice for the government to make, given the strident opposition from port workers unions to such moves.Shipping minister Nitin Gadkari says that the government will introduce the Major Port Authorities Act in Parliaments winter session to govern the 11 ports.Currently, these 11 ports function as trusts under a law framed more than five decades ago called the Major Port Trusts Act, 1963.Kamarajar Port Ltd is the only exception. Kamarajar, which runs the port at Ennore near Chennai, was formed as a company under the Companies Act, 1956, when it was opened in 2001 and operates as a landlord port.The 11 ports owned by the Indian government and run as trusts widely follow a hybrid format of the long obsolete service port model and the preferred landlord model of port management followed globally. This has resulted in a conflict of interest between the port trusts and the private sector, with the former acting both as port regulators and providers of commercial services in many instances.In the service port model, the port authority owns the land and all available assetsfixed and mobileand performs all regulatory and port functions. Here, the port trust is both the landlord and the cargo terminal operator.While the service port model in India was consistent with a centralized economy, it does not fit well in a market-oriented economy, according to experts.In the landlord port model, the publicly governed port authority acts as a regulatory body and as landlord while private companies carry out port operationsmainly cargo-handling activities. Here, the port authority maintains ownership of the port while the infrastructure is leased to private firms that provide and maintain their own superstructure and install own equipment to handle cargo. In return, the landlord port gets a share of the revenue from the private entity.Currently, most major port trusts in India carry out terminal operations as well, resulting in a hybrid model of port governance.The involvement of the port authorities in terminal operations leads to a conflict of interest and works against objectivity. The neutrality of the landlord port authority is a basic requirement for fair competition between port service providers, particularly the terminal operators. The role of the landlord port authority would be to carry out all public sector services and operations such as the award of bids for cargo terminals and dredging.Privatizing cargo berths run by the state-owned ports themselves has, thus, become imperative for a successful transition to the landlord model of port governance, according to a recommendation made by the Indian Ports Association (IPA), a body representing the 12 ports.This recommendation, as the saying goes, is like taking the bull by its horns.Of the total 240 cargo berths operating at major ports (Union government-owned), 66 berths or 28% are on public-private partnership (PPP) model, while 174 berths are state-owned.The PPP potential for the 174 state-owned berths can be gauged on parameters such as traffic projections/cargo growth for the next 10 years (until 2025), with berths registering steady cargo growth of more than 6% becoming preferred choices for privatization, the IPA has suggested in a report to the ministry.Currently, 102 of the 174 state-owned berths load multiple or general cargo. To build financial returns, berths with dedicated cargo have a greater potential for PPP.Besides, mechanized berths as well as berths with scope for mechanization have more potential for PPP since it ensures larger cargo handling and throughput.Berths in ports with overall strong financials, for instance, with over 20% net profit, have a higher potential for PPP. This would be reassuring for prospective investors interested in higher returns, the IPA stated.PPP cargo berths/terminals at major ports have so far been awarded through the revenue-sharing modethe bidder willing to share the most from his annual revenue wins the dealsince these projects were viable on a stand-alone basis. About 10 cargo berths have the potential to undergo PPP through the revenue-sharing model, the IPA wrote in its report.However some of the berths with potential for PPP may be constrained by revenue uncertainties. New models should be explored for such berths such as viability-gap funding, annuity and management contracts, it added.The viability gap funding (VGF) model can be used if revenue from the berth is inadequate to service the capital expenditure. In such cases, a one-time VGF can be provided by the central government to make the PPP investment viable.The annuity model can be used to remove traffic and revenue risk for PPP projects. In such cases, the port authority can pay a fixed semi-annual fee to the private operator to compensate him for capital cost and operational expenses, along with an assured percentage of returns.The private developer, though, will not have the right to any charges levied on cargo. A variation of this is the hybrid annuity model wherein a 40% capital support is provided by the government and annuities are replaced by fixed cash flows to meet the cash outflows of the private developer.If a state-owned cargo berth has no potential for PPP, it can enter into an operation and management (O&M) contract for operations management with O&M fees charged annually.While there is a logical basis for privatizing the existing state-run cargo berths to facilitate the move to a landlord concept of port ownership, it is anybodys guess how this will actually pan out.P.

The draft bill aims to make it difficult to replace US employees with foreign workers and experts say it is likely to deal a body blow to companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd in its present shape.ALSO READ | H1B visa reform bill introduced in US, minimum pay doubled to $130,000If implemented, the reforms may force TCS, Infosys and Wipro to make fundamental changes in their business strategies, including hiring more American workers and raising salaries they pay to employees working on client sites in the USmoves that analysts say will erode operating margins by as much as 3 percentage points.It is an adverse development, but I suspect the minimum wage limit will not rise beyond $100,000. There will be strong lobbying to curb it at that level, said Apurva Prasad, a  research analyst at HDFC Securities. Assuming the minimum wage is fixed at $100,000, the tierI Indian IT companies could take a hit of around 150-300 bps on their operating margins. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. The draft legislation also proposes to reserve 20% of the H1B visas allocated annually for firms that have 50 or fewer employees.Stocks of Indian software exporters plunged on Tuesday. TCSs shares fell 4.47%, Infosyss declined 2% and Wipros 1.62%.ALSO READ | The message from H1B visa reformsAn increase in minimum annual wage to $110,000 for H1B workers may hurt TCSs gross margin by 230 basis points and Infosyss by 170 bps, according to a December note prepared by Investec Securities. The average annual wage for a TCS employee on a H1B visa is $69,658, according to the note. Its higher for Infosy at $79,176.The contentious H1B visas are given to foreign nationals in specialty occupations that generally require higher education, who according to the US government rules include engineers, computer programmers and scientists. The government awards 65,000 such visas to foreigners every year.TCS declined to comment on the development. Infosys and Wipro didnt immediately respond to a request for comment.While tech firms claim they use the H1B visas to hire highly skilled workers in areas that lack top talent, the fact that a majority of the visas are awarded to outsourcing firms from India has drawn criticism from US politicians, who claim companies such as TCS and Infosys misuse the work visa programme to bring low-level IT workers into the US. Around 70% of H1B visas were given to workers from India, The New York Times reported in November 2015, citing  the US Department of Homeland Security.ALSO READ | H1B visas: Business as usual after short-term flapIf skills arent available in the US and per law you cant bring workers in then either the job will remain undone or the job will be shifted to India or some other location outside the US, R. Chandrasekhar, president of software industry lobby group Nasscom, said in a phone interview. It will also be a big loss to the US since outsourcing jobs creates jobs directly and indirectly for the US economy.Firms such as TCS and Infosys may have to use the next few months to devise strategies to deal with the new developments, analysts say. It may take a while for the bill to pass. Until then, they have the time to devise their strategy to deal with this, said Sarabjit Kour Nangra, vice-president of research-IT at Angel Broking.One of the options, says Prasad of HDFC Securities, is to shift work offshore or other near-shore centres or even subcontracting to US firms. Automation of work can also be accelerated, he added. The prevailing protectionist sentiment will lead to a sharp rise in on-shoring and near-shoring arrangements, said Sanchit Gogia, chief analyst and chief executive of Greyhound Research. However, it is critical to remember that these cannot be built overnight.Indian foreign ministry spokesman Vikas Swarup said the nations interests and concerns have been conveyed to the US administration and the US Congress at senior levels.",2017-02-01,TuehxE1ZpalYexm5jKJCvO,"US visa reforms may force Indian IT companies, which depend on H1B visas for recruitments, to make fundamental changes to business strategies",both,01:41,What H1B visa reforms mean for Indian IT companies
-0.47,"Mumbai: Going by the slew of measures announced in the Union budget on Wednesday, such as targeting digital transformation while discouraging cash transactions, its easy to be lulled into believing that India is well on its way to becoming a digital powerhouse.
				   
				And why not? After all, finance minister Arun Jaitley did unveil a series of post-demonetisation digital reforms, including a Rs3 lakh cap on cash transactions, which he said were aimed at fetching the government Rs2,500 crore in revenue. While the initiatives to build a digital India are undoubtedly important, we cannot ignore the fact that India has a long way to go becoming digital. Here are a few reasons:For one, India still ranks a poor 91 on the Networked Readiness Index (NRI) 2016a key component of the World Economic Forums The Global Information Technology Report 2016. The report assesses the state of networked readiness of 139 economies using the NRI and examines the role of information and communication technologies (ICT) in driving innovation. It is thus a key tool in assessing a countrys preparedness to reap the benefits of emerging technologies and capitalize on the opportunities presented by the digital transformation.Also read: Budget 2017: Arun Jaitley unveils series of post-demonetisation digital reformsThe 2016 edition of the NRI placed Singapore at the top of the list of countries when it comes to networked readiness. Finland, which topped the ranking in 2014, came second for the second year in a row, followed by Sweden, Norway and the US, which climbed two places. The remaining top 10 comprised the Netherlands, Switzerland, the UK, Luxembourg and Japan. Networked readiness, therefore, is correlated to per-capita income.Not only was India ranked 91 among 138 countries in 2016, but WEFs figures also showed that India had actually fallen 23 places in the NRI ranking in the last four years. In 2013, when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government was in power, India was ranked 68 on the index out of 144 countries. When the Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government took over in May 2014, the ranking slipped to 83 out of 148 countries. In 2015, Indias ranking fell to 89 out of 143 countries. And in 2016, it slipped two places to 91 out of 138 countries.While Indias absolute score has changed only marginally in recent years, other countries are racing ahead at faster speeds. Lack of infrastructure and low levels of skills among the population remain the key bottlenecks to widespread ICT adoption, especially in terms of individual usageissues that governments have attempted to address over the last 10 years.Also read: Union Budget 2017: The winners and losersAs the WEF report pointed out in its 2016 edition, a deep divide persists between well-connected metropolitan hubs and remote rural areas, which lack even the most basic infrastructure. This implies that BharatNets implementation track record needs to significantly improve for the benefits to reach rural India.Second, Indias spirited talk about becoming a cashless economy happened when the Indian government invalidated high-value banknotes on the night of 8 November, taking out 86% of the currency in circulation by value. It was supposed to be a war on unaccounted and untaxed wealth, counterfeit notes and terror financing. Instead, as serpentine queues formed outside bank branches and automated teller machines (ATMs) went dry for days and weeks together, the slogan changed. It became all about promoting a cashless or at least a less-cash culture in an economy where almost 90% of transactions are paid for in cash. Indians can boast about technologies such as mobile wallets, crypto-currencies such as bitcoin, mobile peer-to-peer payments, blockchain technology, payment banks and architecture such as the unified payments interface (UPI) and the recently-launched Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) app.  But the government is yet to devise a police on online security. The Indian IT Act (2008) alone will not suffice.Third, Digital Indias Rs1.3 trillion programmewhich envisages a plethora of e-governance services across sectors like healthcare, education and banking, and promises to introduce transparency in the system, reduce corruption and achieve inclusive growthwas only given the green light in 2015. And while the Modi government was simply building on the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) that was approved in 2006 under the previous government, it is obvious that digital programmes do not bear fruit overnight.Also read: Budget 2017: A minimalist approach for an evolving IndiaSmart cities are a case in point. It takes 30-40 years to build a city. Programs like Smart Cities and Make in India will require considerable investments in terms of manpower, technological upgrades, skill development, digital literacy and, most importantly, a plethora of standards to be laid out and adhered to. The Internet of Things (IoT) which entails hundreds of thousands of sensors will need interoperability of standards and security policies in place so that our smart devices, smart homes, smart grids and smart cities are not paralysed by smart cybercriminals.Fourth, while one can see tangibles like the governments Digital Locker and other e-services ride on a robust GI Cloud, also known as Meghraj, Internet speeds are poor in India despite the spread of fourth generation (4G) technology. Mobile calls still drop routinely in Digital India. Not to mention that many people in villages still do not have an Internet connection or enough local language content.Fifth is the power of online education. In a bid to bridge the digital divide through online education, Jaitley on Wednesday also announced that the governments Swayam platform, which has been developed by the ministry of human resource development and All India Council for Technical Education with the help of Microsoft Corp., will start offering 350 online courses. Swayam would be ultimately capable of hosting 2,000 courses and 80,000 hours of learning, covering school, under-graduate, post-graduate, engineering, law and other professional courses, according to its website.While online courses are definitely the need of the hour, they again will be dependent on high-speed broadband connectivity, a digital mindset, and more importantly, government recognition for online course certificates without which there will be few takers.India is at the cusp of a massive digital transformation, said Jaitley as he listed digital as one of the 10 key themes in Union Budget 2017. This will indeed be the case if the government does not ignore the hurdles too.",2017-02-01,TvYXoyeYP9Duo3VSGlcCMK,"While the initiatives to build a digital India are undoubtedly important, we cannot ignore the fact that India has a long way to go becoming digital",both,16:40,Budget 2017: Five reasons why Digital India wont happen in a hurry

-0.42,"In late October, Silicon Valley venture capitalist Bill Gurley, speaking to The Wall Street Journal about technology start-up valuations, said, All these private valuations are fake. Theyre all on paper.
				   
				Gurley, managing partner at San Francisco-based venture capital firm Benchmark, has been openly critical for a while of the dizzying valuations attributed to technology start-ups in recent years. His criticism is directed in particular at unicorns, the common term for technology start-ups privately valued at $1 billion or more.Until a couple of months ago, Gurleys criticism had few takers in Indias start-up ecosystem. In fact, back in October, few venture capitalists and even fewer entrepreneurs would concede to a valuation bubble.Sure, there had been a few upsets. Zomato, the restaurant discovery platform backed by Info Edge India Ltd and Sequoia Capital, had fired 10% of its staff as part of a cost rationalization drive. Food ordering start-up TinyOwl, backed by Matrix Partners and Sequoia, had laid off more than 100 people and shut down offices in some cities as it battled a cash crunch. Property search and listings platform Commonfloor was on the block as it failed to draw fresh capital despite having investors such as Tiger Global Management and Google Capital on board.But, unlike elsewhere in the world, where unicorn valuations were being marked down with alarming frequency by mutual funds, Indias unicorns held their mythical valuations. E-commerce bellwether Flipkart was still going strong at $15.2 billion. Rival Snapdeal was cruising along at about $5 billion. Budget stays aggregator and unicorn aspirant OYO Rooms had just snapped up $100 million from Japanese investor SoftBank and others, taking its valuation to a reported $400 million. Even seed-stage start-ups were raking in $1 million rounds. What bubble?In the past two months, however, some of that exuberance has tempered. People still arent talking in bubble terms, but they admit that a correction is underway in Indias start-up funding market. The correction is evident from the numbers for the concluding quarter of 2015. A KPMG report, based on data compiled by research firm CB Insights, shows that venture capital-backed firms in India raised $1.5 billion in October-December 2015, down 46% from the $2.8 billion raised in the July-September quarter. The volume of deals also declined to 114 from 139 in the preceding quarter.The numbers are down primarily because of a correction in later funding rounds, specifically in the Series B and C stages where valuations were most frothy. A quick survey of deals reported across media shows that after September, there has been a marked decline in Series B and C stage deals, especially in terms of value. Compared with the past, only one deal crossed the $100 million markhyperlocal delivery service Grofers raised $120 million in a Series B round led by SoftBank. The ticket sizes of the remaining 15 deals in those stages were well below the $50 million mark. After Grofers, the three largest deals involved e-commerce company Naaptol ($52 million), PepperTap, another hyperlocal delivery service ($40 million), and ethnic products marketplace Craftsvilla ($34 million).Apart from the decline in deal ticket sizes, later-stage rounds are also in a somewhat different complexion in terms of the investors involved. Out of the 16 deals reported, six were led by strategic investors such as SoftBank, Paytm, Snapdeal, Amazon, Mitsui, and even a local family office backed by the Murugappa Group. Venture capital firms have been less visible, preferring to divert their resources to younger companies at the seed and Series A stages. Not because their resources are running scarceIndia-dedicated venture capital funds raised a little more than $2 billion in fresh capital last year, according to data compiled by the Emerging Markets Private Equity Association.Most venture capitalists believe that valuations will correct further. In January, Mint reported that practically every leading venture capital fund in the market expects valuations for mid-stage deals to be between 25% and 50% lower than the 2015 levels. That, most reckon, will take another 6-8 months to play out, and theyre willing to wait. They can afford to wait because hedge funds, notably New York-based Tiger Global (which invests in start-ups from a separate venture capital fund), are no longer breathing down their necks. Hedge funds, until recently among the most aggressive dealmakers in Indias start-up market, are on a hiatus due to the recent turmoil in the public markets.While venture capitalists have started to come to terms with the downturn, entrepreneurs are still holding out. This isnt unusual. Historically, private valuations have always lagged the public markets by a few months. But, theres no doubt that they will eventually correct. Entrepreneurs can take cues from the recent markdown of the value of Flipkart shares owned by mutual funds. The latest to do so is Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund Trust, which has written down the value of its minor stake to $58.9 million, as of 31 December, from $80.6 million in June.The Morgan Stanley markdown brings Flipkarts valuation down to about $11 billion from the $15.2 billion the company claimed when it raised its last round of funds. Thats a fairly big hit, assuming that the lofty valuations that Flipkart claims arent, as Gurley suggests, imaginary.Flipkart is a bit of a lodestar for the countrys start-up ecosystem. That makes the markdown the strongest manifestation yet of the correction that is currently underway in Indias start-up funding market.Winter is here. Make no mistake. But, as anybody whos lived through a couple of downturns would know, its also when the most interesting start-ups are born.Snigdha Sengupta is the founder of StartupCentral, a digital news and analytics platform focused on venture capital. She also periodically contributes stories on venture capital and private equity to Mint.",2016-03-11,TykCW4Pv7yfOmzCSfiBoXJ,"The Morgan Stanley markdown is the strongest manifestation yet of the correction that is currently underway

0.51,"Mumbai/Ahmedabad: The Rs86,000 crore ($13 billion) of cash the Essar Group will get from selling a 98% stake in its oil unit and other assets will not only help it reduce operating company term debt by half, but will also wipe out a substantial part of the holding companys debt, making it the largest debt reduction exercise by an Indian business.
				   
				Even as bank investors cheered, the transaction with a group led by Russias Rosneft PJSC points to the fact that the Indian banking system still has to depend on sale of assets by debtors to achieve true resolution of soured loans.The operating company debt, which includes (that of) Essar Oil, Vadinar Port and Vadinar Power, where the total debt is about $5 billion, will become part of this transaction. This would be a shade over 50% of the operating companys term debt. In addition to this, another $5 billion debt of holding company will also be deleveraged, said Prashant Ruia, director, Essar Group. He didnt reveal the total debt of the group, which brokerages such as Kotak Institutional Equities estimate at Rs1.3 trillion. The deal value of $13 billion is the enterprise value of the assets being sold. The remaining proceeds from the deal will be used to restructure the debt of Essar Steel, settle some of the working capital debt and some will go to the promoters, said Ruia.While we are yet to sit down and discuss this in detail with the Essar Group promoters, the expectation is that some parts will come to the steel company too, a senior official at a large state-owned bank said on condition of anonymity.According to Ruia, the promoters are open to investing further equity in the groups steel company if the restructuring proposal requires them to do so. Prospects at Essar Steel are looking up. We are functioning at about 70% capacity. The project is already completed. We will reach close to full capacity in two quarters, said Ruia. Whatever were the problems of the past, (they) have now been overcome. Essar Steel will soon become the crown jewel of the group, just like Essar Oil was.Most lenders in Essar Steel have classified the Rs40,000-crore account as a non-performing asset, with some such as ICICI Bank Ltd, HDFC Bank Ltd, Federal Bank and Axis Bank Ltd selling either part or all of their exposure to Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Co. Ltd.I will not talk of company-specific future-looking statements, but I would say that possibilities of resolution only increase as the industry does better and as promoters are able to bring in part of their equity, ICICI Bank managing director and CEO Chanda Kochhar told CNBC-TV18.ALSO SEE | Why has Rosneft paid a packet for Essar Oil?ICICI Bank shares gained the most, 6.91%, among Essar lenders as investors cheered news that part of the funds from the oil deal would be used to clear pending bank liabilities.

-0.04,"New Delhi: Over the last two decades Naukri.com, has emerged as a leading name in the job matching space in India. In an interview, Hitesh Oberoi, chief executive of Naukri and its holding company Info Edge (India) Ltd, talks about how Naukri has grown as a business and Indias changing jobs scenario. He also speaks about how Info Edge is growing from being the holding company for a hiring firm into an investor role and if it would invest further in Zomato. If we see an opportunity to acquire a company and own 100% in it, we will do (it), Oberoi says. Edited excerpts:
As a leading jobs match maker, how do you see the jobs space shaping up in India?What weve seen for the last two years is growth reviving but it is not secular  not across sectors. Growth for the last six to eight quarters has been driven largely by IT sectors, Internet services, e-commerce. Now, we see banking and financial services also picking up, pharma has also been strong. Services have been doing okay. We are worried about a slowdown in IT, and IT companies are talking about it.How has Naukri changed as a businessfrom one dot com boom to another?When we got funded in 2000, after two years of our existence, there were only two million Internet users in the country. Nobody even understood how the Internet could be used for hiring. So what we did in the first few years was to educate, acquire and train customers on how to use Naukri for hiring. In the last few years, Internet has become mainstream. Some 350-400 million people are online. Smartphones are omnipresent. Companies now hire more than 50% via online. They must be using Naukri, other job boards, their own websites, a referral hiring programme, social media, etc.We have seen a massive shift from print hiring 15 years ago to bulk hiring through online. And this will only accelerate. We are trying hard to enable e-hiring for companies. Naukri is offering a career site management service where we power company career sites through our software.Is the career site management service helping to diversify your portfolio?We saw this coming a few years ago. We have 65,000 corporate customersfirms big and small. We realized that they still dont hire completely from Naukri. They still want to use their career websites, referral hiring programmes. So, we started diversifying to these areas. We now have a referral hiring manager and have facilities which help companies run their referral hiring programme through a portal. We see this as an opportunity for us to develop new revenue streams over time. Today, single digits in percentage terms of revenue comes from these products but it could become substantial in the coming 4-5 years. Naukri is a Rs500 crore business, and even 5% of that is a significant number...(it) can become double digit in five years.Earlier, Naukri was the flagship brand, but now Info Edge is becoming a venture capital kind of play with several investments. Is Info Edge growing as an investor rather than a hiring company?Naukri is still maybe 70% of our revenue, but there are other operating businesses which are now growing rapidly and are becoming bigger. For example, 99 acres did about Rs115 crore revenue last year and is growing at a faster rate than Naukri. Jeevansathi has turned profitable. Shiksha business is also breaking even. These three businesses, on a quarterly basis are generating a revenue of about Rs55-60 crore for us, bigger than most of the Internet companies out there. So, we are fairly bullish that going forward these businesses will become big.And this does not include Zomato. Outside, we have invested in 10 or 12 companies, and some of these will also do very well. We see ourselves as an operating company. We have these three-four verticals in the company...they bring us cash and enable us to invest outside. Hopefully the outside investments will become large and increase our overall top line.I would not say that we are a VC player, but yet if there is a good opportunity, we dont mind investing outside. But we dont have a fund like any other VC would have...We look at opportunity, if we see more opportunity in the internal business, well invest there and similarly for outside. If we see an opportunity to acquire a company and own 100% in it, we will do (it).You have invested around Rs860 crore, do we see this growing by certain percentage over next three years?For example, we own 50% of Zomato and thats a lot. We dont go by targets, we go by opportunities. If we see an opportunity, we dont mind whether it is inside the company or whether it is an acquisition opportunity or an investment.Yes we have some basic rules, like we dont like to invest in non-Internet businesses, we try and invest mostly in India-focused business, restrict ourselves to the consumer Internet space, we like businesses inside our market places. These are the broad guidelines which we follow while investing, but we are open. So Naukri may become much less than 60-70% of the business?If it happens because other businesses are growing then its fine, but if Naukri is not growing then thats a problem. We actually see a lot of opportunity in the job business, because we are very diversified and working on different things. And who knows if GDP growth picks up-for every 1% GDP growth, our business (Naukri) grows 8-10%.  You spoke about Zomato, are you investing further in them?Zomato has had a very good run for the last few months, they have cut down their burn immensely. Revenue has gone up and they are sitting on a lot of cash. I would say they are comfortable today but tomorrow theyll try to raise money as they will need it for growth and opportunities, well see at that point of time.",2017-01-18,UKeBtqn6OUjrVEmDLTAzhP,"Naukri, Info Edge (India) CEO Hitesh Oberoi on Indias changing jobs scenario, investments in Zomato and how Info Edge is growing into an investor role",both,00:40,We are worried about a slowdown in IT: Naukri CEO Hitesh Oberoi
-1.0,"London: Big Oil is poised to reap rewards this year as investments made before the crude price slump pay off just as recovery starts.
				   
				Seven of the worlds largest energy companies will together boost oil and natural gas output by 398,000 barrels a day, the most since 2010, according to data from Oslo-based consultant Rystad Energy AS. In 2018, output will rise even faster.The oil majors arent increasing their drilling budgets. Instead theyre benefiting from money invested before the rout. Lower costs combined with higher output would allow companies including Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc to maximize their gains from improved oil prices. Should crude remain above $50 a barrel, 2017 could be a break-out year, eliminating the need to borrow to pay dividends, according to analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein.They could hit a sweet spot this year, said Mark Tabrett, a London-based analyst at Bernstein. Heavy investments of previous years are paying off with more production, costs have been cut and the companies are in a position to take advantage of that when oil prices rise.After reaching an intraday low of $27.10 a barrel on  20 January, Brent oil prices more than doubled to a high of $57.89 on 12 December. The global benchmark rose 52% last year, its biggest yearly gain since 2009. Shares in the majors, meanwhile, rose across the board, led by Shell, whose B shares gained 53% in London, the best annual increase since at least 1990.Brent averaged about $45 a barrel in 2016, and is expected to rise above $55 this year, according to the median of 45 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Yet the majors, still smarting from more than two years of depressed prices, have expressed a reluctance to increase spending.For us this will be about not starting to run too fast, Statoil chief executive officer Eldar Saetre said at a conference in Oslo last week. There wont be a lot of new activity initiated when it comes to larger projects in 2017.2020 problemRystad estimates that the seven companies will boost output by about 670,000 barrels a day next year. Still, years of under-investment during the time when oil prices were low mean the production gains may be short lived.Output should start declining eventually for the majors that slowed project-sanctioning, said Rob West, an analyst at Redburn (Europe) Ltd, a London-based equity broker. Field-by-field models suggest thats a problem for 2020.Much of the expected increase is coming from offshore oil and gas projects approved at the start of the decade, said Espen Erlingsen, vice-president for analysis at Rystad. Theyre the kind of mammoth projects that are difficult to shut down once they get going.Included is Chevron Corp.s Gorgon liquefied natural gas project in Australia, which partly resumed operations last week, and Kazakhstans Kashagan field, in which Eni SpA, Exxon, Shell, and Total SA all have stakes, which began producing last year. Eni expects oil and gas production to climb to a record in 2017 even as spending continues to fall.A plan by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and 11 other nations to curb their supply and boost prices wont stand in the way of these companies growth plans, Redburns West said.While they all have production in Opec countries, the cuts are mostly concentrated outside of the majors portfolios, or cover assets that were declining anyway, he said.The majors are now starting to harvest from the investments they did at the beginning of this decade, Erlingsen said. Production is expected to grow, while investments are falling. Bloomberg",2017-01-11,USaR7mcuMq4D8T2c9vh7pL,"Seven of the worlds largest energy companies will together boost oil and natural gas output by 398,000 barrels a day, the most since 2010",competitor,10:37,Big oil hits sweet spot as new projects reap rewards of recovery

-0.53,"Tokyo: Tesla Motors Inc. unveiled plans to collaborate with Panasonic Corp. to make solar-energy components for SolarCity Corp., bolstering Elon Musks final push to merge the auto maker and solar company.
				   
				Production of photovoltaic cells and modules for solar energy systems used by SolarCity will begin in 2017 at SolarCitys factory in Buffalo, New York, Tesla said in a statement late on Sunday. The deal would be a win for Panasonic, which has shifted away from consumer electronics products to focus on housing, car information systems and car batteries.Musk, who is Teslas chief executive officer and chairman and chief financier of SolarCity, has proposed combining the two companies to give consumers one-stop shopping for an electric car as well as the solar-powered electricity that will power it. But Teslas bid to acquire SolarCity has been fraught with corporate governance issues because the boards of both companies are deeply intertwined. The Tesla-Panasonic deal is contingent on approval of Teslas acquisition of SolarCity by the respective shareholders in a vote on 17 November.We are excited to expand our partnership with Panasonic as we move towards a combined Tesla and SolarCity, J.B. Straubel, Teslas chief technical officer, said in the statement.The agreement deepens an existing relationship between Tesla and Panasonic, which are jointly building a $5 billion lithium-ion gigafactory in Nevada to produce batteries for the Model 3 electric car and energy storage products for home and utilities. Tesla said it intends to secure a long-term purchase commitment for PV cells from the Japanese company, according to the statement.Shares of Panasonic climbed as much as 2.5% in Tokyo trading Monday. Teslas stock closed 1.9% lower last week, down 18% this year.Musks effort to unite Tesla and SolarCity, which is projected to lose money for at least two more years, has been under close scrutiny. Six of the seven directors on Teslas board have SolarCity ties, and SolarCitys CEO is Lyndon Rive, Musks first cousin. Musk has argued that the fact that the two companies were separate at all is largely an accident of history.SolarCity has been trying to stave off a default on its debt. It said in its most recent quarterly filing that it was getting closer to violating bond covenants. The company fired 108 employees in August and scaled back guidance for growth for the year to 900 to 1,000 megawatts from 1,000 to 1,100 megawatts.SolarCity, among the top installers of residential rooftop solar panels in the US, acquired solar manufacturer Silevo in 2014.

-0.31,"For the past two decades, every time the management of Dabur India Ltd met to finalize a new product, it ended up also debating whether to stick to Ayurveda or to focus on non-Ayurvedic products.
				   
				The decision to launch non-Ayurvedic products came 113 years after S.K. Burman set up Dabur in 1884 in Kolkata. In 1997, the home-grown Ayurvedic products maker launched Project STARS (Strive to Achieve Record Successes) to accelerate growth through diversification. It launched Real, a fruit-based beverage.Ayurveda cannot take Dabur far, the Burmans were convinced. So, the family that popularized Ayurveda in India moved away from its core strength.Over the next 19 years, the companys focus intensified so much on non-Ayurveda products that just the food business accounted for about 11% of its Rs8,436 crore revenue in the year to March 2016 and 18% of domestic sales came from foods. Not just food, it launched a number of non-Ayurvedic products in segments like personal care and home care as well. Overall, about 40% of its sales came from non-Ayurvedic products in the year to March 2016. The wheel of change was set for a spin. But then came yoga-guru-turned-businessman Baba Ramdev. Under his company Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd, he launched a range of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) based on Ayurveda. In recent months, ever since Patanjali started aggressive advertising on television, it has challenged companies such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), Colgate-Palmolive (India) Ltd, Nestlé India Ltd that compete in Indias Rs3.2 trillion-a-year consumer packaged goods market.Theres more. Going by Ramdevs projections, Patanjali will cross Rs10,000 crore in revenue in fiscal year 2017from Rs5,000 crore in FY16. This is more than what brokerage firm Morgan Stanley India Co. Pvt Ltd projected as Dabur Indias revenue in FY17Rs 9,630 crore.Besides, Dabur started feeling the pinch as sales of its honey (a product that is estimated to have more than 65% market share) started declining earlier this year as people  bought Patanjalis cheaper variety.The Burmans realized that Dabur needs to get back to basics and return to its coreAyurveda.The future, says Dabur India chief executive officer (CEO) Sunil Duggal, will be driven by Ayurvedic products. With this validation (success of Patanjali), we are more committed to staying and growing the natural equities and not string into other domains. So it provides a lot more focus to the companys activities and a lot more opportunities to grow within spaces that we are familiar with rather than to get into unfamiliar spaces which obviously would be much riskier, he adds.There were reasons why Dabur was unsure about sticking to only Ayurvedic products.The Burmans wanted to build an empire outside Indiaacross the Middle East, Africa, Europe, North America and South Asia, which together accounts for 32% of Daburs consolidated sales at present. Across all these countries, Ayurveda was never a popular or saleable concept. So the shift was only  natural.Although Dabur was probably the only Indian company that was selling products made of Ayurvedic formulations nationwide, it was unsure about how far it could take Ayurveda. Till recently, the ability of Ayurvedic products to go deeper was under some question. Ayurveda can go deep in certain areas, not all. Like skin care, it may not go that deep. But we are now beginning to question that paradigm. Now we are far more convinced that Ayurveda can go far deeper in many areas than what we thought earlier, says Duggal.Faith vs evidence A couple of months ago, the company revamped its marketing communications with a new taglineScience-based Ayurveda. So far, it was celebrate life. All our advertisements and other communications are now based on one themeScience of Ayurveda. There have been changes in packaging and marketing communications as well. We need to be relevant to the youth, says K.K. Chutani, executive director (marketing) at Dabur India. Besides, in February this year it tied up with e-commerce marketplace Snapdeal to set up an e-store for its Ayurveda products called LiveVEDA. Chutani believes, e-commerce was an imperative for Daburs future.The rationale behind Daburs new communication is its history. The Burmans have been marketing Ayurveda for more than 130 years. But it cant just bank on its history or legacy. The platform that we are going to leverage is the science-based Ayurveda, backed by research, validation and hard evidences. It will appeal to a lot of people who may not believe in faith-based Ayurveda (unlike Ramdevs followers), adds Chutani. Emergence of Patanjali, believes CEO Duggal, is a blessing in disguise for Dabur. Patanjali products are sold primarily based on peoples faith in Ramdev. His marketing and Patanjalis well-spread retail presence has already, and probably would, convert a lot of non-Ayurdevic product users into regular users of Ayurvedic or herbal products. There has been some learning from Ramdev. To my mind, he has given a big impetus to Ayurveda and his large number of followers are driving it. The desire for Ayurvedic solutions runs very deep in Indian psychology. It would be very silly of us not to take advantage of that, says Duggal, who joined Dabur in 1995 and became CEO in 2002.By 2020, Dabur targets Ayurvedic products to constitute more than 75% of its sales in India, from around 60% now.To focus more on Ayurvedic formulations, the company is doubling its herb cultivation. By March 2017, Dabur will have 3,800 acres for medicinal herb farming, up from about 2,000 acres at present that it has developed during past two decades. It also has a greenhouse at Pantnagar in Uttarakhand. The company will be spending Rs600 crore in back-end supply chain. The medicinal farming will be spread across eight states in India and Nepal, and engage about 2,500 farmers, up from 1,200 at present.We have been marrying the age-old Ayurvedic heritage and traditions with cutting-edge scientific prowess. We have a strong in-house research wing that follows a bush-to-brand approach. We have our in-house nursery, which grows several rare herbs that go into various products. Dabur is probably the only company which is involved in both classical or ethical as well as OTC (over-the-counter) formulation research for close to 40 years now, says J.L.N. Sastry, head (research and development, Ayurveda) at Dabur India. In a note on 21 September, Citi Research, a division of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., said, Dabur claims to focus on science-based high quality Ayurveda products with an emphasis on R&D, which makes it well positioned to ride this wave.Countering PatanjaliIn May, Dabur launched an advertisement for its honey which said it was approved by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) that ensures safety. Patanjalis honey does not have FSSAI approval. The ad came on the back of a drop in sales of Dabur honey at the beginning of the year. The company has been selling honey since 1994  and dominates the market with close to a two-thirds share.However, Patanjali honey directly hit Dabur primarily because of the price difference. Daburs honey was priced about 40% higher than Patanjalis. We got things corrected through offers and other things. We find people who switched are returning. But there is a section of people, financially stressed, who may not come back. But we have to deal with that. We cant have all things for all people, says Duggal. The company also launched brand extensions like honey fruit spreads.Interestingly, in an earlier Mint interview, Ramdev said his rivalry was with multinational companies (MNCs) not the home-grown ones like Dabur. But a Patanjali spokesperson said that even if Dabur is an Indian company, it has no right to loot people. Products are overpriced. Be it an Indian company or MNC, it should operate ethically, and products should be economical. With Patanjali, backed by Baba Ramdevs marketing, the market for Ayurvedic and herbal or natural products has expanded, which certainly is an opportunity for everyone, he added.Commenting on FSSAI certification, or the lack of it, the spokesperson said that Patanjalis honey had passed all required tests and is safe. As honey is a products that is consumed both as a medicine and a food item, FSSAI approval is not mandatory, he added.Besides honey, even Daburs toothpaste sales were impacted but Duggal dismisses concerns about it by saying the category has not been growing. In fact, Dabur Chyawanprash, the market leader with an estimated 65% share, also faced stiff competition after Patanjali started mass marketing Chyawanprash at a much lower price last year. But its impact was not severe, maintains Duggal.However, Dabur narrowed the price gap with Patanjali and tried establishing Chyawanprash, a predominantly winter product, as a product relevant for others seasons like monsoon through intense promotional activities. With Patanjali coming in, the category might grow better. He (Ramdev) will convert a lot of non-users into Chyawanprash users. He could be a good ambassador for Chyawanprash, adds Duggal.In a note on 21 September, Citi Research  said, Dabur has been managing competitive intensity well through brand building (strong digital push), value-added variants or formats and by reducing price premiums in segments like honey with price-offs and promotions... Reducing the pricing premium with extra weight (such as 1.25 kg for the price of 1 kg) and / or price-offs, upping the ante on honey brand building and the extension to value-added variants and formats are examples of a well-rounded approach to tackle the aggressive competition from Patanjali.Daburs challenge, according to Sunita Sachdev, an analyst with UBS Securities India Pvt. Ltd, is to re-invent its brand and make itself relevant to the current crop of consumers. Getting back to its rootsAyurvedais very appropriate, said Sachdev.Peer pressureDabur India isnt under pressure from Patanjali alone. Competition in the domestic market in the last few years has increased as almost every packaged goods companyhome-grown and multinationalhas rolled out products that are herbal or natural. The trend has been triggered largely by Patanjalis success and the opportunity the category offers for premiumization of products.In recent years, HUL and Colgate, local units of MNCs, have ramped up their portfolios with premium Ayurvedic products in key brands. Home-grown Emami Ltd and Himalaya Drug Co., which have been selling herbal or Ayurvedic products for long, have gained from their traditional herbal positioning. These companies are extending brands into new and emerging segments to improve profitability. And all of them are trying to expand. While Emami bought Ayurvedic hair oil and shampoo brand Kesh King from SBS Biotech Ltd in June 2015 for Rs1,651 crore, HUL acquired Kerala-based Indulekha hair oil brand for Rs330 crore earlier this year to boost its presence in Ayurvedic space.Interestingly, Dabur was the first to tap the hair oil space with a herbal product Dabur Amla hair oil back in 1940 and expanded its hair care portfolio in early 1990s with Vatika brand. But it failed to leverage the advantage of an early entrant.Admits Duggal, We never thought products like shampoo can be marketed as an Ayurvedic product. With recent developments in the market, we are now thinking of launching Ayurvedic shampoo. Some of our bets will work, some may not. But Ayurveda can go beyond the imagination of people.Herbal or Ayurvedic still constitutes a very small part of personal care market in India. According to a research report (September 2015) by UBS Securities India, herbal products comprise 6-7% of the personal care products market, but the volume is growing at about twice the segment average. The report estimated herbal to grow to about 10% of the segment by FY20 as the trend accelerates.Duggal, however, believes Dabur has the advantage of being a company that has been the original marketer of Ayurveda in India. There are differences between Ayurveda and herbal. Herbal is a step before Ayurveda. Ayurveda is a completely different ball game, he adds.Distressed economyBesides increasing competition, slow growth is a serious worry for Dabur too.In April-June 2016 quarter, the companys sales grew just 1.2%. In the quarter ended March 2016, it reported a 4% increase in volume in the domestic market compared to a 7% growth in the preceding quarter. Post results, the management had painted a cautious outlook for FY17. It expects things to get better only in the second half of FY17. The key challenge that we are facing today is that theres a radical downward shift in the overall consumption of consumer goods because of tapering of the stimulus that was provided by the earlier government and has not been taken forward by the current government. The current government is following an investment-led growth and not consumption-led growth that has triggered a consumption stress, primarily in rural market, which was the prime driver of growth between 2008 and 2014, says Duggal.A double-digit growth is very unlikely in the next one-two years for the packaged consumer goods firms. I am hoping for 6-8%. I never expected this sharp a decline in consumption. I knew it will come down but not from 12% to 3-4%, says Duggal, adding that consumption will improve in  a gradual manner starting 2018.Two consecutive poor monsoons also hurt consumption. A relatively good monsoon, coupled with the seventh pay commission money in the system, is likely to provide some impetus that would help consumption recover. However, the picture is not that dismal as packaged goods companies like Dabur are enjoying high marginsthanks to stability in commodity prices resulting in low input costs. Its a good thing. But the downside of the combination of high margin and low demand will typically lead to a lot of pricing activities. Reduction of prices in some cases and aggressive promotions are obvious. Well have to deal with that aspect. Some of the margins may be passed on to the consumers, adds Duggal.Rewriting ruralAbout 45% of Dabur Indias domestic revenue comes from rural markets and, as mentioned above, consumption in rural markets has not been growing for the last few years. Naturally, the company not only stopped expanding its distribution network in rural areas, in the last one year it also stepped out of certain markets to minimize its risk.Thats not all. It also reorganized its sales force in rural markets. The company hired about 1,000 people to sell its products in villages starting this April. Earlier, village sales representatives were under the payrolls of third-party human resource companies. Dabur is shelling out the same amount of money but the village sales representatives are earning more as their salaries are not being shared by third-party firms. They are the sons of the soil. They understand these markets. With them coming on our rolls, productivity and sales have improved. Rural markets will start growing again. Well ramp up distribution and marketing to capture the growth prospects thats expected in the second half of the year, adds Duggal. Dabur typically pays Rs2 lakh a year and incentives to the village sales representatives.Tweaks in distribution and go-to-market efforts, according to the Citi Research note, will help Dabur improve productivity of the enhanced footprint, besides doctor detailing could be a key driver for healthcare offerings.For urban markets, the company, in June, divided its portfolio in four pieces home and personal care, healthcare, OTC medicines, and food and beverages. Theres a separate sales team for each of these segments. Earlier there were three segmentsOTC, FMCG and food. The change is aimed at bringing a deeper focus on individual segments.Dabur products now reach around 5.3 million outlets. In comparison, HUL reaches about 6.3 million of the estimated 8 million retail outlets in India. Cigarette-to-shampoo maker ITC Ltd reaches to around 4.3 million retail stores.Advantage spreadDabur has a unique mix of diverse growth enginesjuices, healthcare, skincare, international business and home care. And, it has four cash cowshair oils, digestives, health supplements and toothpastes. The growth engines, noted Morgan Stanley in a report, can use cash cows to generate consistent, superior growth. Dabur has the ability to launch highly differentiated product offerings across its product portfolio, catalyzed by the recent success of Patanjali, increase in disposable incomes, lifestyle changes and increasing awareness of Ayurvedic products, it report added.OTC products are seen as the most exciting growth opportunity for Dabur, backed by the companys brand strength, knowledge of Ayurveda, doctor advocacy, and product heritage. We expect a slew of launches over the next few quarters with a focus on daily healthcare and lifestyle ailments. This business also has one of the best gross profit margin profiles. We believe growth will inflect as consumers perceive these products as being efficacious for overall health and wellness and likely balance out the adverse impact of rapid changes in lifestyles currently under way, said the Morgan Stanley analysis.Eyes on buysAcquisition was one of the routes that helped Dabur grow, mainly in markets outside India. The company, which has more than Rs2,200 crore of cash on its balance sheet, is now looking for buyouts in India to ensure faster growth. In the last few years, organic growth has been slow and Dabur has not made a pitch to acquire any firm. The companys deals team is already working on a few targets. Despite the fact that the management is open to spending about Rs1,000 crore on acquisitions, Dabur is only looking for small buys. I like small brands that are scalable, primarily regional brands with national relevance. I hope to close at least one deal by end of this financial year, says Duggal.Dabur is looking at Ayurvedic brands and brands in the adjacent areas. It is unlikely to buy any company that is in the generic products space as that could conflict with its existing product offering. There are a few generic products, but buying a generic product maker would be replication. Thats one of the reasons why we did not buy Zandu (which got sold to Emami in 2008), he adds.Likely acquisition targets could be companies that make branded proprietary products in areas such as digestion, cough and cold, fever, lifestyle disease management, among others. However, there are not many targets in the market.Acquisitions make sense. Despite high valuations, Emamis acquisition of Kesh King and HULs Indulekha buyout were relatively successful, says Sachdev of UBS Securities.Its key acquisitions in India include Balsara Hygiene Products Ltd, maker of Babool toothpaste and Odonil air freshner, in 2005 and female skin care products maker Fem Care Pharma in 2008. Over the years, some of the brands it acquired from these two firms, such as Fem, Babool and Odonil, have crossed the Rs100-crore sales mark. Even its international business has primarily grown through acquisitions post- 2010. International woes About 32% of Daburs consolidated revenue comes from international markets by selling personal care products across the Middle East, Africa, Europe, North America and South Asia. The Middle East is the biggest market that accounts for 33% of the companys international sales, followed by Africa (22%), Americas (17%), Asian markets excluding India (17%) and Europe (11%).But companies, including Dabur, have been facing challenges in these markets mainly due to political uncertainties, currency fluctuations and falling oil prices. Low oil prices have led to a downward pressure on oil producing economies with governments adopting austerity measures, curbing spending on major projects and reducing subsidies which has eroded disposable incomes. Most of the markets have witnessed sharp depreciation in their currencies which has led to lower value realizations in our business. Geo-political turmoil in MENA (Middle East and North Africa) has, to a large extent, impacted markets such as Syria, Libya, Yemen, Iraq and others where there has been a reduction in consumption due to large scale displacement of human population, says Mohit Malhotra, CEO of Dabur International Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dabur India.Dabur, however, will continue to invest in these marketsin brands, distribution and building local supply chains to ensure better pricing and margin.Also see | Our aim is to make Dabur a multinational from India: Amit BurmanIn July, Dabur India acquired Discaria Trading, registered in South Africa, for just Rs4,679 (1,000 South African rand). It was a small but important acquisition. With this, the company got an entry to South Africaa market it has been trying enter for a long time. Dabur already has two manufacturing plantsone each in Nigeria and Egypt.Africa has been on the radar of Indian packaged goods and personal care firms for the past few years primarily because of projected consumer spending. Consulting firm McKinsey and Co., in a report in 2010, projected consumer spending in Africa to double to $1.8 trillion by 2020. Dabur made its first foreign acquisition in 2010 by buying Hobi Kozmetik Group, a leading personal care products company in Turkey, for $69 million. It also acquired US-based Namaste Laboratories for $100 million in the same year. Our twin acquisitions took place almost a decade after our entry into the overseas markets and these acquisitions have helped us further consolidate our overseas business. We have emerged as the Indian-born FMCG transnational entirely through the organic route, says Malhotra. Prior to these acquisitions, the company primarily sold hair oil under Dabur Amla and Vatika brands in the overseas markets. Now, its international portfolio is dominated by products it got from acquisitions. According to Citi Research, hair oil accounted for about 39% of sales from international markets together, followed by shampoo (14%), hair cream (13%), oral care (11%), skin care (7%) and styling products (about 12%) in FY16, contrary to hair oil contributing about 93% to the business in FY06.Namaste business has been steady and we believe local manufacturing and distribution in Africa should provide a fillip to the business from 2017 onwards. Local manufacturing would enhance the price competitiveness of Namaste products that are currently imported and thus at a significant price premium. Steps to enhancing sales and distribution for Namaste products in sub-Saharan Africa should help Dabur deepen its presence. For the other overseas operations, management talks of a somewhat lower adverse forex impact vs the previous year. Geopolitical or economic issues in Saudi Arabia and parts of North Africa remain, but the companys foray into Iran could be a new positive driver from second half of FY17, Citi Research said in the 21 September report.Going forward, Dabur will deepen presence in many of the countries in Africa, primarily where it already has presence, and across markets in South Asia. Two markets where it sees a better future are Myanmar and Iran. The company already has a presence in Myanmar, and it is setting up a factory in Iranprobably the last big market thats left unexplored due to blockadeto start selling products early next year.We are open to exploring inorganic opportunities to fill gaps in our existing portfolio and geographic presence, says Malhotra, adding that the company has not earmarked any amount for buys and can fund acquisitions through internal accruals and debt. Sachdev of UBS Securities, however, says there is risk in the international business. Theres also sub-scale which hinders their ability to generate quicker higher returns, she adds.Analysts darlingCompetition may be stiff and growth may be slow but Dabur India is considered an attractive investment proposition in consumer staples by equity analysts.Over FY16-18, noted Morgan Stanley in its report on 25 April, Dabur will become the most expensive staples stock from one of the cheapest now. It added, Even as the stock has outperformed the Sensex by 6% over the past six months, it has underperformed peers like Godrej Consumer Products Ltd, HUL and Marico Ltd by 10-30% on concerns of rising competition, especially from Patanjali Ayurved.Brokerage firm CLSA, in a report on 29 April, noted that the Dabur stock was up 11% in the past three months and it will continue to outperform as growth visibility is improving.",2016-10-23,UgUhTXwedPBnKgK0sgqIiO,"Feeling the heat from Baba Ramdevs Patanjali Ayurved, Dabur returns to its roots: Ayurveda ",both,23:42,Dabur goes back to basics to take on Patanjali

-0.98,"One of the authors of this article built a speech recognition engine in the early 1990s. It was built on a special purpose digital signal processor, in a lab that was especially dedicated to this project. The engine required two days of training, could recognize a single voice and had a vocabulary of close to 50 words. It was close to state-of-the-art at that time. 
Cut to the present. All smartphones today have the ability to recognize speech. No special hardware is needed. Training needs are minimalthe technology works straight out of the box and can be trained to recognize anybodys voice. And the vocabulary is infinite. The phenomenon that enabled this rapid change is the advancement in processing power, storage and communication. Computing speed is doubling every year, as per Moores law, which predicted an exponential growth in the number of transistors in integrated circuits within processors. Similar stories of transformation can be told about storage and communication. Todays technology road maps have gone beyond the classical Moores law with the advent of distributed computing, rapid development of smart devices packed with sensors and the Internet of things.While we have seen a lot of technology transformations over the last 20 years, what is even more fascinating is the expectation that the next two decades will see technology innovations being rolled out at a faster pace than ever before. Technological change will continue to be exponential. Noted inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil argues that there is even an exponential growth in the rate of exponential growth! What this means is that in the 21st century, we wont see a 100 years of technological progress. We will see 20,000 years of progress at todays rate.FIVE BIG TECHNOLOGY THEMES FOR THE FUTUREWhile there are many technological advancements taking place all around us, we think five big themes will play a very important role in defining the next 20 years.Gene is the new Byte: In the grand scheme of things, we are all very similar. In fact, 99.9% of our genes are identical. Its the last 0.1% that makes all the difference! In April 2003, the human genome was completely mapped for the first time. The rate of reduction in the cost to sequence a persons genome has outpaced even Moores law, from $10 million in 2008 to just $1,000 today. Going forward, this cost is likely to continue dropping and in the near future, we would be able get our complete genome mapped and stored in USB drives or on the cloud for a mere $100. This will open the doors to fantastic possibilities for preventive healthcare and personalized medical treatment. Genome mapping has large implications for agriculture as well, with possibilities like the development of more productive and disease resistant crops, or the creation of diet plans tailored to suit our respective heredities!Disruptions in energy: The end of energy as we know is near. Advancements in technology have reduced the cost of solar energy to 45 cents a watt from $100 a watt in 1970. Interestingly, during this period, other forms of energy have seen a 16-fold increase in price. The average cost of solar panels fell by 75% between 2009 and 2014, and is expected to decline by another 25% by 2018. Solar power tariffs are expected to reach grid parity in India in 2018, and then go below that level. Battery technology is advancing rapidly to help store this energy. Polymer and hybrid-flow battery technology being developed currently will increase energy density, increasing the storage capacity of a given physical space. It is likely that in the near future, many of us will be able to generate, store and use clean solar energy right off our rooftops, at a cost cheaper than buying electricity from the grid. With smart micro-grids, one will even be able to sell excess energy back, creating a truly distributed energy network.Advancements in material science: In Star Trek, the science fiction television show, the crew on-board starships used food replicators to synthesize any meal they wanted while travelling through space. This surreal concept is now inching towards reality. 3D printers have come a long way since the 1980s, and are soon going to be affordable enough for educational and residential usage. Nanomaterials with unique optical, electronic and mechanical properties are driving the next generation of consumer electronics, filtration systems and biomedical treatment. Similarly, advances in biodegradable plastics augur well for environmentally friendly packaging in the future. Ubiquitous digital connectivity: Ubiquitous digital connectivity has been elusive so far although it has been widely talked about by policymakers and technologists. But it is inevitable. Digital access will become more and more affordable as prices reduce. Consumers will increasingly bracket digital connectivity among needs as basic as roti, kapda and makaan (bread, clothes and home), and will allocate a larger share of wallet for it. Digital governance platforms will help governments significantly improve the distribution of subsidy programmes targeted at people with limited means and lastly, corporates that stand to benefit heavily from a burgeoning consumer class may make the economic trade-offs differently. AI and robotics revolution: Artificial intelligence (AI) is already a reality today with Google Search, Siri and IBM Watson being some examples. Todays AI tools excel at complex analytics. In 2016, AI mastered Go, widely considered the most difficult strategy game. However, it struggles with cognitive tasks that a two-year-old can dofor example, knowing the difference between the pictures of a cat and a dog. Genetic algorithms being developed today will strengthen AIs cognitive reasoning capabilities. Limitations on raw computational power will soon be overcome, powering AI tools to do what human brains can. Meanwhile, rapid advances in robotics, such as the development of bio-hybrid robots built using living tissue, are starting to take shape. We are on the cusp of an explosion in AI and robotics, which could make androids a reality in the near future.The interplay between these technology megatrends has the potential to significantly change the world as we know it today. Imagine solar energy-powered 3D printers being airlifted to disaster zones to provide food to people trapped there. Or, a mother in Salem, Tamil Nadu, getting her sons genome mapped, and later getting on a video conference with a New York-based doctor to seek allergy treatment options.Fundamental paradigm shifts driven by accelerating technologyChange in technology fundamentally shifts the production possibility frontier. Every time we hit the law of diminishing returns, newer technology provides a breakthrough. In addition to fundamental shifts in the cost curvewhich are a giventechnology expands the gamut of the possible by significantly altering core trade-offs. Let us look at three conventional business and economic trade-offs, which are getting busted:Two-way real-time interactions versus one-way outreach: In the past, businesses could either focus on rich information tailored to a niche market or reach out to a larger market that sacrificed richness for the additional reach. However, today, two-way, real-time communication with rich and relevant content has become a reality. Digital technology enables access to global platforms for buying and selling, marketing and financing from anywhere. Advanced analytics, combined with mobile technology, is allowing companies to target each consumer individually, across their entire client base. For example, if it is raining, your regular coffee shop can tempt you to brave the weather and visit it by offering you a promotional scheme on your favourite drink, through an app on your smartphone.Supply and demand mismatch: With the shift towards elimination of bespoke hardware, and value migrating to software, it is possible today to match supply with demand almost perfectly. Increased access and connectivity via technology is driving a revolution in the sharing economy as well. Sharing is not new to us. The barter system has been in place for centuries, long before money was invented. Today, we are not only sharing digital information, we are also sharing physical things like homes and vehicles with each other, using digital market places.Scale versus cost: Technology is not only rapidly reducing servicing costs, it is also increasingly enabling businesses to move to an opex spend model, from the erstwhile capex heavy approach. This is helping expand firms reach to new consumers at a faster rate than ever before. For example, consumers with very low deposits can be served economically in an opex spend model, telecom base stations no longer need minimum efficient scale, retail distribution can be customized economically at a micro-market level, and 3D printing can significantly change manufacturing scale. SPECIFIC IMPLICATIONS OF ACCELERATING TECHNOLOGY FOR INDIARadical innovation with next-generation technology architecture:The Internet has served as the main platform for disruption across industries. Its architecture is decentralized, modular and stacked. Lower down the stack, the focus is on scale and efficient utilization, for example, server capacity. Higher up the stack, however, the focus is on content related to user needs and innovation. This stack-based architecture eliminates the trade-off between efficiency and innovation, as higher-layer innovators can rent scale from lower-level platform providers to conduct experiments at lower costs. This is already a reality in our lives. Case in point, Uber, which uses a stacked architecture comprising GPS, Google Maps, electronic payments and connected smartphonesnone of which it ownsto offer a disruptive and consumer-friendly transportation solution.In India, we are witnessing the rising usage of a similar stacked architecture, called the India Stack, in the financial services sector. Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar and mobile phones have created a fundamental layer of customer identification and access, on which multiple digital transactions can be built. This has the potential to solve our financial inclusion problem by eliminating the classical roadblocks of paper-based identity proofs, interaction with a physical bank and the availability of hard cash. The entire stack is an open resource, which means anyone can access and leverage it. A similar open stack architecture is being used by the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) to provide a platform for tax data management and reporting. The platform will provide the plumbing to bring together all GSTN stakeholders including taxpayers, banks, and central and state governments to completely transform Indias tax landscape.This is paradigm shift in technology architecture where innovation happens at the bottom of the stack and is available as a public good at a very low cost to everybody. The implications of this shift are quite profound and if deployed well can be used to address some of our very core socio-economic challenges.Ability to address Indias chronic challenges: Healthcare is one of the most complex challenges of our time, with the infrastructure and capital required to fix the problems and reduce the inequity in healthcare access being insufficient so far. Despite making progress over the last decade, India accounts for a disproportionate percentage of global incidences of disease. We have seven doctors for every 10,000 people, which is only half the average global doctor-patient ratio. Large-scale change is never easy, but technology holds extraordinary promise in helping address our healthcare challenges.By leveraging the technology stack already in placewide connectivity through mobile phones and high-speed data networks, Aadhaar, digitization of health recordswe can significantly improve every element of our health system, from education for prevention, to treatment and management. Big Data and analytics can fundamentally alter healthcare delivery and transform our public health and medical research initiatives through the establishment of national registries. India can become data-rich very rapidly. And a nationwide, connected, many-to-many health information highway with common data standards and interoperability features can just be what the doctor ordered! A similar approach can also be deployed in critical areas such as education and skilling, and it can fundamentally transform how India teaches and learns.Enabling organizations to be trailblazers: Historically, Indian firms have found it hard to address the challenges of low average purchasing power, lack of minimum efficient scale and widespread socio-economic inequity. With the acceleration of technology, these challenges get decimated. Acceleration in technology, coupled with relatively lower legacy investments, gives Indian firms the opportunity to leapfrog their peers to become global trailblazers. Technology makes investments modular, reducing capital outlays and experimentation costs, while increasing speed and agility, which are critical advantages in todays dynamic macroeconomic environment. There is every reason to believe that the next Alibaba, Amazon, Google, Tesla or Uber can emerge out of India.GOING FORWARD, WE NEED TO ADDRESS THREE KEY AREAS TO UNLOCK THIS TECHNOLOGY REVOLUTION1. How do we ensure sufficient investment in infrastructure at the lower level of the stack?Private returns on infrastructure investments are often substantially lower than the underlying social benefits generated. While benefits accrue to the economy at large through positive externalities, this does not assure returns for the infrastructure investor. Also, when infrastructure investment requires an entirely new generation of expensive technology, such as fibre, 4G or 5G, it can compound market failure. The government, through policy formulation, has a key role to play in encouraging sufficient investment in infrastructure.2. What changes should be make in our education system to equip our youth for the technology revolution?There is a need to rethink technology and vocational skills being imparted at higher education institutions. Future jobs will be very different from those in the market today. In addition to solving the existing challenges our education system faces, we need to ensure that it equips our youth with the necessary multidisciplinary skills to meet the needs of tomorrow. 3. How do we drive collaboration across stakeholders to unlock the full potential of technology-enabled transformation?The government, large corporates, start-ups and NGOs have different strengths and capabilities. There is a need to draw upon the expertise of all these stakeholders, and marrying together their complementary skills. We need the right policies and construct for public-social-private partnerships to make this happen.In summary, technological change is accelerating at an unprecedented pace and will change the world as we know it. If we get our act right as a nation over the next decade, technology can help us take India back 1,000 yearswhen we were the most advanced and thriving economy in the world.Neeraj Aggarwal is managing director, and Rohit Ramesh is partner and director at BCG India.",2016-10-19,UoAUwuuIFV498ndi95U3PI,"If we get our act right, technology can help us take India back 1,000 yearswhen we were the most advanced and thriving economy in the world",both,04:59,Accelarating technology: Indias opportunity to leapfrog
0.22,"Mumbai: More than half the BSE-100 companies that have reported September quarter results have beaten earnings estimates, but analysts say a broad-based earnings recovery is still at least two quarters away.
				   
				A Mint analysis of quarterly earnings of 53 members of the BSE-100 index shows that 28 of them have exceeded consensus earnings estimates by Bloomberg. Similarly, 14 out of the 30 Nifty-50 firms that have reported their earnings have beaten expectations.Contrary to what the September quarter earnings show, analysts say there are no visible green shoots of an economic revival and volume growth in sectors such as consumer staples and cement indicate subdued demand. The earnings season has not provided any signs of an incipient economic recovery and management commentary on demand for the next two-three quarters is generally subdued, said a 1 November Kotak Institutional Equities note to clients.  Volume growth will become increasingly relevant as a driver of profits from here on as the scope for reducing costs to improve earnings is largely over, the note added. Sharing a similar view, Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd, in a 2 November note, said the fiscal second-quarter earnings season has been in line with expectations so far on the headline numbers front, but much better on internals (earnings breadth, upgrade/downgrade ratio, surprise vs., miss ratio). Volume growth trends have been mixed.The dismal performance of Indian information technology (IT) companies and banks, especially Axis Bank Ltd, added to the disappointment of investors. There were expectations that bad loan issues could bottom-out in Q2, but that has not happened. In the IT sector too, there is a lot of disruption and large-cap IT stocks could take time to gather the momentum they had earlier, said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities Ltd. The poor volume growth reported by packaged consumer goods companies indicates that rural spending has not yet picked up despite normal monsoon rainfall, he added.Another point of concern is whether companies will be able to sustain their profitability at the levels seen in the quarter ended 30 September. Some analysts say that a surge in global commodity prices will limit further expansion of operating margins even as  the benefits of low input prices from inventory acquired at lower cost is likely to fade away soon. One of the highlights of this result season is that some sectors have shown margin expansion on the back of lower commodity prices which is not sustainable going forward, so margins will not stay at these levels, said Vaibhav Agrawal, head of research at Angel Broking Ltd. But how deeply rising input costs will dent profitability will be known after December quarter earnings, analysts said. Companies may have to resort to price hikes if raw material prices rise substantially.Meanwhile, the wait by investors for the positive impact of a normal monsoon and seventh pay commission payouts to reflect on companies performance has got a bit longer. We will have to wait for one or two more quarters to see signs of rural spending revival and its impact on economic growth, Jasani said.",2016-11-03,Up1k7NidxDziMcC5XxKUxJ,"Broad-based earnings recovery is still at least two quarters away, say analysts",competitor,01:42,"Earnings pick up in September quarter, but no turnaround yet"
0.16,"Mumbai: Private sector lender Catholic Syrian Bank (CSB) is set to get a new managing director and chief executive soon. The names of three former officials from public sector banks have been sent to the Reserve Bank of India for its approval, said CSB chairman S. Santanakrishnan. 
				   
				The names before RBI are C.V.R. Rajendran, chief executive of the Association of Mutual Funds of India and former chairman and managing director of Andhra Bank; M.S. Raghavan, former chairman and managing director of IDBI bank; and Jeevan Das Narain, former managing director of the State Bank of Travancore. CSB is also looking for a candidate to replace Santanakrishnan after he retires early next year, said a person in the know. CSB has been struggling with bad loans and operational losses for many years. The bank had planned to raise Rs400 crore through an initial public offering last year, but dropped the plan due to weak financial performance. According to an Economic Times report, Canada-based Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd is looking to acquire  more than 10% stake in CSB. Fairfax with investments in IIFL, ICICI Lombard, and Bangalore International Airport Ltd (BIAL) has committed close to $1 billion in India so far. CSB reported net profit of Rs5.3 crore for the six months ended September 2016 as against a loss of Rs40.5 crore a year ago. CSBs gross non-performing assets dropped to Rs462.7 crore for the period, from Rs503.6 crore in the year- ago period. In percentage terms, NPAs dropped to 5.7% from 5.76% of total assets.

-0.44,"In 2011, only about 9% of all transactions made using credit and debit cards in India happened at a point of sale (through the swiping of the card at a merchant location), with the remaining 91% being accounted for through ATM withdrawals.
				   
				In August 2016, the latest month for which data is available, this number had risen to 17%. In other words, Indians have gotten significantly more comfortable swiping their credit and debit cards at points of sale in the last five years.There are two factors that have contributed to this trend.First, the use of credit cards (seldom used at ATMs) has gone up in this period. While the absolute number of credit cards in circulation has only gone up by about 50% between April 2011 and August 2016 (from 18 million to 26 million), their usage has increased by nearly a factor of four, from Rs7,100 crore in April 2011 to Rs26,000 crore in August 2016.Looking at it another way, each credit card in circulation was used an average of 1.3 times a month in April 2011, a number that went up to 3.2 times a month in August 2016. Second, the usage patterns of debit cards has changed in the last five years. In April 2011, less than 3% of all debit card transactions (by value) was at a point of sale, while in August 2016, this figure had gone to nearly 8% (by number of transactions, the corresponding figures are 5.3% and 14.7%, respectively).Interestingly, as the usage of debit cards at points of sale has gone up, average per-transaction value of a debit card swipe has actually gone down over time. In other words, people have over time become more comfortable with using debit cards for small transactions.ALSO READ | How to deal with loss of credit/debit cards and online frauds?Coming back to the overall use of credit and debit cards at points of sale (relative to usage at ATMs), the months where Diwali has occurred in the last five years show an interesting pattern.

-0.45,"Mumbai: If India has to grow, its not about large corporations growing but about micro-entrepreneurship developing at the grassroots level, says Siddhartha Pahwa, group chief executive at Meru Cab Co. Pvt. Ltd.
				   
				One of the early starters in this business, launched in 2007 as a radio cab service, Meru has a fleet of about 20,000 cars, of which 6,000 are company-owned, in 21 cities.The company started revamping since late last year, looking to raise a total of $100 million so it can compete with other rivals, of which it has raised about $25 million, Mint had reported in June. Pahwa spoke about what he says is a subject close to his heartdrivers as micro-entrepreneurs. Edited excerpts:Why do you believe driver-owners are entrepreneurs?We have had this concept since 2007 where we did not call them our drivers or employees. We called them DSEdriver, subscriber, entrepreneur. Merus business model is that the driver decides how much he wants to work. We never had any rules on how many hours he has to work. We give you a car, you pay a sum on the car, you keep it 24x7 and then all upsides are yours. An entrepreneur is someone who, for all the hard work, should get a large part of the rewards. About 40% of our drivers in Bengaluru and Hyderabad send their children to English-medium schools where the fees could be as high as Rs1,500-2,000. A large set, 10%, of their children, are doing post-graduation.Was a change in mindset needed?None of these guys are used to saving or long-term planningwhat they get today, they spend today. Then, they dont get anything tomorrow and get upset (laughs). If you work hard, we will give a concept, for a safety net. The first right over your earnings is yours, I will take my share later. Initially, all cars belonged to us. In 2011-12, we came with a plan. You buy your own car. If you can raise money yourself, then good, or we will buy it for you. You run it for four years, and fifth year on, when there is no EMI, its yours.People started buying, in the scheme called Chaalak se Maalak. The driver becomes an owner. People realized if I pay down my EMIs (after three years of scheme), I can buy a second car. Then they got a second driver. For all training, etc. he will work with Meru but financial deals are done between first and second driver. He is a service provider now; no longer just a driver.They started earlier with hiring family, nephews, people from village, etc. but realized this is limiting and so started developing relationships and responsibilities. This has become second-third level.Long term, we believe this industry would need a million drivers. Currently, the gap is still big. None of the drivers want their children to do this profession, though they earn Rs25,000-30,000 a month. They believe their children would be better off even if they become a call-centre employee, for example. The reason is dignity of labour: Society needs a change of mindset.In India, only 5% of the households have vehiclesthe global average is more than 40%. India does not have the infrastructure for this. Taxis can take care of (transporting) seven-eight families a day. Taxis will help reduce burden on infrastructure and environment. What we are trying is to make the process of getting drivers in easier and make it a robust system in tier II-III cities. Out of 100 drivers, if 30-40% say they will allow their children into the profession, I would believe the shift has happenedof driving being considered a profession on equal footing with others. How are you doing things differently now since 2007-08?Meru had a strong back-end technology when we started. Since 2012, when Ola, Uber came in, we realized our front end may not be as good. We had a website and a call centre. We shifted to an app. By early 2013, we were on a par with others in both back-end and front-end technology. We believe we are way ahead in processes, on how to handle customers and passengers. The competition is using only incentive as a system. They give smaller fares and give double to drivers but our ecosystem is stronger. We have a scholarship programme for our drivers children. We get drivers for at least four years and exclusively. That gives us a longer/better relationship, rather than a purely transactional one. We as an organization believe you have to earn some margins or some loss for some period. The kind of capital abuse thats happening in India in this sector is worrisome. More competition should survive so benefits to sellers and consumers continue. If the industry survives, infrastructure and environment issues will be resolved.You are trying to raise $100 million, of which a quarter you already have. How does this benefit the drivers?We clearly do not want to go head-on with any of our competitors. There is still a lot of training needed, which will be a focus, plus internal quality and in-cab quality. Will you also expand to more cities?There are 45 cities where this cab service is useful; we are in 21. We believe this year our focus is to consolidate these citieswith more cars, drivers and better technologyand we will not expand to other cities. I believe the number of trips a car does in India is much lower than the number in others, like Singapore, for example. The industry average is 10-12 trips, Singapore does 20-25 trips. There are many dead pockets in Mumbai, like the extreme south. Thats where training and knowledge is useful. In such a large country, where you have to move 300-400 million people a day, a large market share will be with a few (service providers), but the third player can be niche, and profitable. We are the first choice for people going to the airport because of advance booking.

				Delays gaining regulatory approval for Wi-Fi in Indian airspace arent dissuading satellite operator Inmarsat Plc, which said its talking preemptively to carriers, including Jet Airways India Ltd and the local unit of Singapore Airlines Ltd, about enabling connectivity on their flights.We are keeping a very keen eye on movement around the regulatory environment, said Rash Jhanjee, a director for airline market development for India, Middle East and Africa at Inmarsat, in an interview. The Indian consumer, the average business user on these planes, is now expecting connectivity on the ground as well as in the air.Civil aviation secretary R.N. Choubey said there is a fairly good chance permission to operate Wi-Fi in Indian airspace would be given in about 10 days. That was on 24 August, yet officials are no closer to pinpointing a start date. Meantime, all airlines have to disable Wi-Fi access when flying over India, Facebook Inc.s biggest marketa rule foreign airlines have lobbied to have abolished.The home ministry has expressed concern that in-flight Wi-Fi may pose a security threat because of difficulty tracking voice and data usage from the air, and others have questioned whether there would be a market for the service in a nation where discounted base fares start at just 2 cents.Directorate General of Civil Aviation is studying the matter to ensure all of the considerations are adequately addressed, Union minister Jayant Sinha said in an 6 October interview. As soon as that is done, we will issue a statement, he said, declining to give a time frame for a decision.The regulator said its yet to receive a proposal from the aviation ministry on Wi-Fi usage in Indian airspace.Jet Airways, Indias second-largest carrier, began offering in September one-way wireless streaming technology that enables passengers to play a selection of video and audio content directly on their mobile phones and other personal devicesa step toward offering broadband-enabled Wi-Fi connectivity following regulatory approval.Competitive pressure is pushing airlines to match competitors providing cabin connectivity, according to Euroconsult, which said in February that 72 airlines had installed or announced plans to install passenger connectivity systems on board at the end of 2015. Civil aviation officials in China expect restrictions on the use of mobile phones to be lifted by early 2017, paving the way for wider in-flight connectivity.$5.4 billion marketParis-based Euroconsult said it expects the number of connected commercial aircraft to reach 23,100, or 62 percent of the global fleet, by 2020, from 5,300 last year. Revenue from passenger connectivity services will approach $5.4 billion by 2025, from $700 million in 2015, it said.Having a service like Internet on board an aircraft should not be considered as a luxury, said Mark D. Martin, founder of Dubai-based aviation adviser Martin Consulting LLC, in an interview. The Internet today is an imperative. You need to know whats going on around the world. You have to be in touch, you have to be connected.He said airlines should weigh the costs though. Passengers in India pay just $10.36 for every 100km flown, the cheapest in the world, and the Indian regulator has a history of intervening when extra fees are introduced.Viability questionInstalling Wi-Fi can take about 13 days for a typical low-cost Indian airline flying an Airbus A320 jet, cost Rs.29 million, and result in a loss of Rs.184 million in revenue, according to Martins analysis. That would mean a total cost of Rs.26.4 billion for the fleet of IndiGo, the nations biggest carrier, and Rs.5.8 billion for SpiceJet Ltd, the nations second-largest budget airline, Martin said.Its going to be extremely difficult to recover the investment that you need to make for this to be available in an entire fleet, he said.IndiGo declined to comment, an external spokeswoman for the company said in a text message. SpiceJet didnt immediately respond to a request for comment.Free serviceThe demand will be quite good if its free, said Sanjiv Kapoor, chief operating officer of Vistara, a joint venture between Singapore Airlines Ltd and Tata Sons Ltd. The company, which already provides in-flight wireless streaming of pre-loaded content to customers personal electronic devices, is assessing the viability of full Internet connectivitya service it assumes customers wont pay for.With about 462 million people browsing the web in India, the nation is home to 13.5% of the worlds total Internet users, making it the second-biggest user base in the world, according to Internet Live Stats, which tracks Internet usage.Given a choice, as many as 86% of Indian air travelers would prefer to fly with a carrier that offers Internet connectivity, according to a survey Inmarsat did in May.

So in IPO, when you go to market for the first time you offer 10%, Arijit Basu, MD and CEO, SBI Life said in a press conference. SBI Life Insurance is a joint venture between State Bank of India and BNP Paribas Cardif. SBI owns 74% of the total capital and BNP Paribas Cardif the remaining 26% stake. The insurer has an authorised capital of Rs2,000 crore and a paid up capital of Rs1,000 crore. Early December, State Bank of India had sold 3.9% of its stake in SBI Life to global private equity major KKR and the Singaporean sovereign fund Temasek Holdings for Rs1,794 crore or $264 million, valuing the third largest private life insurer at around Rs46,000 crore. Replying to a query, Basu said the picture is still unclear whether SBI will dilute entire 10% or 5% each by both the partners. If the SBI is to divest the entire 10% then its stakes comes down to 60% from the existing 70%, he added. He said the company grew at 39% in individual new premium till December whereas the industry grew at 20% to 22%.

0.39,"New Delhi/ Mumbai:  Explorers in the worlds fastest-growing oil market are seeking lower taxes on crude produced from local fields to encourage fresh drilling as India tries to reduce its dependence on energy imports.
				   
				State-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) and the biggest private producer Cairn India Ltd. want finance minister Arun Jaitley to at least halve the cess on crude oil production in the Union budget due 1 February. India surprised some explorers last year with its 20% ad-valorem tax on every ton of crude produced locally, moving from a fixed charge. Companies pay more now with crude near $50 a barrel than they did under the old system when it was double the price.Globally, given the low oil price scenario, governments have provided incentives to stimulate and attract investments, said Sudhir Mathur, interim chief executive officer at Cairn India. In India, the cess rate of 20% acts as a disincentive to increase production and commit incremental investments.Attracting investments to boost output from local fields is key for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has made energy security a priority and set a target of cutting oil imports by 10% in the next five years. Reducing the levy will help explorers including ONGC and Cairn India, which oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan estimates will spend $25 billion by the end of this decade. Indias hydrocarbon resources are highly undeveloped and production has been declining for the past several years, prompting the government to nudge companies to invest in reversing the fall and increase energy supplies.New Delhi-based ONGC is spending over $5 billion for its biggest development plan in a deep-sea block in the Bay of Bengal off the countrys east coast. Cairn India also plans to spend as much as $4 billion over the next few years to drill for oil.Asias third-largest economy meets about 80% of its crude oil requirements through imports.We need some money to be left behind so that we are able to flow back into the investment cycle, said A.K. Srinivasan, finance director at ONGC, the nations biggest explorer.Otherwise there will be cash shortage. Already, we are going to run cash shortages.At a price of $55 a barrel, ONGC may have to pay about $11 as cess, compared with $9 when prices were $100 a barrel and the tax was fixed charge, he said. With crude prices firming up, the cost impact of this tax is quite high.Brent oil prices have risen about 17% since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) agreed in November to cut production for six months starting in January. The fuel traded above $100 as recently as September 2014.Firming crude prices may also allow the government to reduce the levy on retail prices for gasoline and diesel, according to Dhaval Joshi, an analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd.India didnt pass on to consumers the entire benefit of crudes price decline from July 2014, increasing excise duty on the two fuels nine times and mopping up about Rs960 billion ($14 billion) in the previous two fiscal years.The government may now look at easing prices as one way of cushioning the impact of its 8 November ban on high-denomination currency notes, which impacted the rural population the most, as it prepares for five state elections this quarter. The consumer price of diesel, the most-used fuel in the country, is at a record while that of gasoline is at the highest since August 2014, according to state-run fuel retailer Indian Oil Corp.s (IOL) website.

				It was in April 2015 that USL informed shareholders that the board had lost confidence in Mallyas continuation as chairman. This was after an internal inquiry confirmed funds diversion from USL to UB group companies.But they could not make him go. When Diageo entered as a majority shareholder, it had agreed to keep Mallya as chairman, as long as the UB group held a 1% stake. That smart move on Mallyas part allowed him to remain chairman till date. The current arrangement breaks the stalemate.While Diageo is paying money to Mallya and has made certain other concessions, USL has decided to not proceed on the financial irregularities uncovered in the internal inquiry and also made some financial concessions. In turn, UB group entities will terminate old business agreements with USL, freeing it of further financial obligations.Shareholders may look at this as good riddance. The money was already gone and a long and messy legal battle awaited them if they tried to recover it. The companys management can instead focus their full energies on running the business. Operationally, nothing will change as Diageo-appointed managers are already running the show. The liquor industry is going through difficult times as it is, with regulatory and policy changes affecting growth. USL reported flat growth in the December quarter in volume terms.But the stink from this episode wont go away so soon. News reports indicate that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) may probe the current transaction. There are other investigations going on pertaining to these irregularities. There are questions on whether USL did right by settling or whether it should have tried to recover the amounts. It also raises uncomfortable questions about the quality of governance and oversight, even among well-known listed companies, if irregularities of this nature and magnitude come out only when a newcomer replaces the incumbent management.USLs share has risen by 20% since 18 February, whereas the announcement was made only on 25 February (a day when the share rose by only 2.4%).

-0.22,"Donald Trumps ascendency from a billionaire property developer to the man destined to become the 45th president of the United States is nothing short of mercurial, but it is also clouded with many uncertaintieshe attracts a strange and shadowy following of racists; he has never held public office and is, therefore, politically inexperienced; he has odd ideas about how to deal with immigrants; he wants to tear up trade deals; he has been furiously back-pedalling on election pledges; and theres that misogyny.
				   
				To many, this is nothing short of a nightmare.We have known all about all of the above for months. But theres one area of concern that is only now being addressedthe potential of huge conflicts of interest. What does the advent of a billionaire businessman into the White House mean for good governance, particularly when the entrant is from an industryproperty constructionknown to be rife with corruption?Are we about to see the emergence of the kind of kleptocracies that were known to plunder the national resources of countries back in the Cold War days, with those stolen resources then making their way to secure banks and other assets in the West? A small number of US newspapers have used the word kleptocracy in commentaries about Trumps conflict of interest, but that may be an over-stretch.It is also true that kleptocracies have survived the Cold War in countries such as Pakistan (Asif Ali Zardari), Egypt (Hosni Mubarak) and Nigeria (Sani Abacha). And conflicts of interest have tended to crop up in democracies across the world, including the US and UK.One recent Asian example is Thaksin Shinawatra, the billionaire media mogul who was prime minister of Thailand from 2001 to 2006. Credited with rolling out policies that benefited the rural poor, healthcare and economic growth, Thaksins later years in power were marred by increasingly strident protests over charges of corruption and conflicts of interest. While infrastructure projects were executed, many benefited companies owned by his family. Amid increasing political instability, the Army took over in 2006 and Thaksin, convicted in his homeland, fled to the UK, where he bought the Premier League football club Manchester City for nearly £82 million. Thaksins fabulous wealth (some £4 billion was said to have been frozen by the UK) is comparable to that of Trump, who, according to Fortune magazine this year, is worth $3.7 billion. The magazine, which has scoured the Trump business for 35 years, says his fortunes fell $800 million this year, mainly on account of a softening of New York Citys real estate market, particularly in retail and office.Fortunes investigations into 28 Trump assets show his aircraft alone are worth $35 millionmade up of three Sikorsky choppers, a Boeing 757 aircraft and a Cessna. His overseas property management and licensing deals include at least three in IndiaTrump Gurgaon, Trump Towers Pune and Trump Towers Mumbai, although these luxury condos merely pay Trump to use his name, according to Fortune.Already, according to The Economic Times, Trump has taken time off his busy transition schedule last week to meet with three Indian real estate developers from Panchshil Realty and Tribeca Developers in New York. But Indian property developers wont be the only ones lining up at Trump Towers in New Yorkor may be even Washingtonin search of business opportunities. That is the nature of business. Far more important is how Trump himself approaches such business opportunities. So far, the signs have been decidedly mixed. On the one hand, he recognizes that there is a potential for conflict. The president of the United States is allowed to have whatever conflicts he or she wantsbut I dont want to go by that, he has said. And: In theory, I dont have to do anything, but I would like to do somethingI would like to try and formalize something. I dont care about my business. I dont want to have people saying conflict.But in his very first meeting with a British political figurehis friend and leading Brexiter Nigel Farageafter winning the election, he brought up his objections to a planned wind farm near a luxury golf course he owns in Scotland. Andy Wigmore, a former Brexit communications chief who attended the meeting, said, Mr. Trump kept returning to  the issue of wind farms. He is dismayed that his beloved Scotland has become over-run with ugly wind farms which he believes are a blight on the stunning landscape.When newspapers reported this incident, and other similar incursions of business in his initial political interactions, Trump appeared to lose his temper. Prior to the election, it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world. Only the crooked media makes this a big deal! he wrote on Twitter.Trump is not the first billionaire to want to be president of the US. Ross Perot in 1992 tried to do the same. You cannot possibly legislate to keep millionaires and billionaires from contesting elections in democracies. But the trend increasinglyand this is in line with predictions by 19th century European economists and political scientistsis that of convergence of big business, political power and the media.For anyone worried about the health and future direction of democracies, this above all should be their biggest nightmare, not the ascendance of individuals, however wealthy. That is the real danger from conflict of interest.Dipankars Twitter handle is @Ddesarkar1",2016-12-02,Vr8ZjiLocntMfsaiks5u1J,"What does the advent of a billionaire businessman into White House mean for good governance, particularly when the entrant is from an industry (property construction) known to be rife with corruption",competitor,00:57,Donald Trumps biggest problem: conflict of interest

				The US central bank is seen raising borrowing costs later this year given the fiscally expansive policies proposed by Donald Trump, and the new presidents agenda may help to lift wages in 2018, hoisting labour costs, the bank said in a 25 January report. BNP was the top gold and precious metals forecaster in the fourth quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Gold may yet find support from higher inflation in the first half of 2017. But the Fed will pursue rates hikes in the second half of the year, keeping the dollar strong, commodity strategists Harry Tchilinguirian and Gareth Lewis-Davies wrote. In 2018, BNP Paribas expects the Fed will hike every quarter.The Fed raised rates in December for the first time in a year, and investors are seeking to determine the likely timing of further hikes as the worlds largest economy shows signs of recovery and Trump gets down to business with vows to accelerate growth, create jobs and boost spending on infrastructure. The precious metal dropped after Trumps surprise win in November amid optimism about the outlook, then rebounded this month.Theres scope for gold to hold on to the January gains, even possibly add to them, BNP said. But as we near the end of 2017, expectations of Fed rate hikes will take over stewardship of gold prices. In turn, the path of least resistance for gold is likely to be downward again.Bullion outlookBullion for immediate delivery traded at about $1,199 an ounce on Thursday, up 4.5% this year, according to Bloomberg generic pricing. Last year, it rose 8.1% to snap three annual declines even after dropping in the final quarter. Prices may average $1,210 this year, $80 more than previously forecast, and $1,100 in 2018, BNP said.Last month, policy makers lifted the target range for the benchmark federal funds rate to 0.5% to 0.75%, and penciled in three quarter-point increases for 2017, according to the median of their quarterly estimates. While the BNP note didnt spell out in figures the size of the hikes it expects, a graph showed six quarter-point increases through to the end of 2018.Fed chair Janet Yellen has backed a strategy for gradually raising rates, arguing in remarks a day before Trumps inauguration last week the bank wasnt behind the curve in containing inflation pressures but nevertheless cant afford to allow the economy to run too hot. For now, Yellen indicates that the Fed is not behind the curve and that resource/capacity utilization is yet to be strained, the BNP analysts said. This suggests rates hikes are more likely to come later, rather than earlier this year. In the interim, year-on-year inflation will pick up.The forecast period for hikes given by the bank through to the end of next year goes beyond the end of Yellens current term, which expires in February 2018.

0.06,"Delhi and Mumbai are such important markets for Indias top telcos that they have allocated over a third of all their investments in spectrum on these two markets. Not so for Idea Cellular Ltd. Less than 11% of its total outlay for spectrum purchases since 2010 has gone to these markets. 
				   
				And these arent the only markets the company has remained underinvested in after the latest spectrum auction. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities wrote in a note to clients that while Idea Cellulars pan-India ambitions remain, it still has a weak mobile broadband footprint in five large marketsDelhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The company has only a single 3G or 4G carrier in these markets, compared to multiple FDD and TDD carriers acquired by its larger competitors. Lets face itIdea doesnt have a parent that can write a $7 billion cheque. Building strong capacity in these markets is an expensive affair; Idea has to use its resources judiciously and direct them to markets where it has a high share, says an analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage firm. To be sure, Idea Cellulars investments in the remaining 17 circles are even higher than those of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone India Ltd. In the above-mentioned five markets, Idea Cellular has a relatively low market share, which means that its customers in these markets generate low Arpu (average revenue per user) and are unlikely to use 4G services anytime soon. As such, the firms strategy in these markets appears to be to compete largely in the low-end of the market, with some broadband capacity to cater to those who want to upgrade. Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd have acquired significant capacity in these markets, which will result in faster connectivity as well as the ability to handle large volumes of data. High Arpu customers will naturally gravitate to one of these companies. A moot question from Idea Cellulars perspective is if there is a business case at all to continue investing in these markets. Operating in the low-end of the market is a low-margin business, which will get further compressed with the ongoing fall in tariffs after Reliance Jios launch. That Idea sees the possibility of building a business case in these circles at some point is a bold assumption, but gritty bold moves are not new to the company, Kotaks analysts say in their note. Vodafone India , despite the $7 billion cheque from its parent company, decided to stay without either 3G or 4G capacity in five marketsAndhra Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir. These markets account for 19% of the industrys revenues, and about 9.5% of  the companys revenue.

1.0,"Through the second half of 2012, guilt was a constant companion for this Delhi-based entrepreneur. Two years after she had co-founded a higher education venture, disagreements with her partners over equity stake were threatening to derail the business.  
				   
				She had a 25% equity in the venture that was founded to meet the demand for talented analysts and accounting professionals in the financial services sector. The full-time, one-year programme was essentially a combination of the chartered financial analyst and certified financial planner courses.The institute had managed to get 19 students in the first year and ensure their placements in firms like HDFC Life and ICICI Bank . Thanks to a strong buzz, the student intake for the second batch had increased rapidly. Fifty students signed up for the Rs.2.4 lakh course. But troubles were round the corner. The entrepreneur recalls that some of the key mistakes of the co-founders, including herself, were losing sight of the monthly expenses and the heavy toll the years marketing budget (Rs.45 lakh) took. By then, she had invested  Rs.12 lakh, a part of which had come from her husband and in-laws, in the venture. Her partners, who used to run another educational institute in Mumbai, refused to increase their stake. Together, they couldnt agree on a third partner who could infuse the capital needed. In June 2012, the founding team decided to call it quits, after investing about Rs.1 crore in the venture. Fortunately, the second batch had cleared the programme by then. When you run an educational institution, the most guilt is towards the students. Its not great to have the name of an institute that doesnt exist any more on your CV, says the entrepreneur. Failed ventures can come swift and strong in the world of entrepreneurship. As the conversation around several prominent and hyper-valued start-ups, especially in segments such as food technology, real estate and e-commerce, has turnedwith fewer stories of growth and more stories of layoffs, big-bang implosions seem more real than ever. Last month, for example, I happened to visit the building in Noida, adjoining Delhi, that used to house the headquarters of AskMe, a consumer Internet search platform. Four thousand people had lost their jobs in August alone. Earlier, the building would have been abuzz with young people swarming the lobby area and spilling out on to the pavements for cigarette breaks. This time, there was an eerie silence. Ironically, in the ecosystem of lavishly funded start-ups, the sting of failure seems to have lost some of its stigma. Earlier, the fear of failure stopped people from becoming entrepreneurs. Today, however, failure is accepted as being necessary on the route to success in business. In a culture like ours, which is averse to risks, it is probably even useful. Contemporary business literature is full of inspiring quotes about failure. Yet the business utility of failure conceals the personal cost. No quote on failure really justifies the experience, founders have told me. What do failures scabs and wounds look like? Are they like that forgotten hairline fracture that tingles with pain at the onset of winter? Or more like an open wound, infected with painful memories? Guilttowards ones family, employees who get left in the lurch, and early supporters who backed the ventureis often the most vicious monster. In the end, though, it doesnt kill you, says a Mumbai-based entrepreneur, with more than a hint of irony. Hes on to his third entrepreneurial venture nowthe earlier two folded up. There is an intense need to cry and lock yourself in for some time. Friends and family, though they mean well, cant really help. Its lonely.  Surviving Start-ups focuses on the stories of the people (parents, siblings, spouses and friends) who make up an entrepreneurs world.

0.07,"Geneva: Trafigura Groups purchase of 24% of Essar Oil marks a strategic shift as the trading house builds its position in the fast-growing Indian market and deepens ties with Russias Rosneft PJSC.
				   
				Part of a $13 billion deal spearheaded by Russias state-controlled petroleum giant Rosneft, its the largest oil acquisition in the 23-year-old commodity traders history. The transaction is expected to increase market share for Trafigura, the third-largest independent oil trader that already handles more than 4 million barrels a day.Trafigura wont disclose how much it will pay for the 24% interest in the 400,000 barrels-a-day Vadinar refinery and a network of 2,700 Essar Oil service stations. Trafigura will use its own equity plus its stake in the refinery as collateral for bank financing, but said it doesnt plan to tap the bond market.The deal, first reported by Bloomberg News in July, will see Rosneft acquire 49% of Essar Oil as well as a port terminal and power plant that values the entire transaction, including debt, at about $13 billion. Trafigura has formed a special purpose vehicle with Russian private investment fund United Capital Partners called Kesani Enterprises that will hold the investment outside of Trafiguras corporate structure.Strategic positionEssar Oil occupies a strategic position in the global oil market, Trafigura chief executive officer Jeremy Weir, who took over the top job following the death of co-founder and former chairman Claude Dauphin in 2015, said in a statement. It owns world-class refining and infrastructure assets that will create multiple synergies with our trading business.While the record Essar deal, which marks the largest single foreign direct investment in Indian corporate history, will give Rosneft a deep foothold in a market expected to overtake Japan as the third-largest oil user and the fastest growing crude consumer through 2040, it is also expected to boost Trafiguras trading volumes significantly as it fights for market share with rivals Vitol Group, Glencore Plc and Gunvor Group.Also Read: Deal with Rosneft is US sanctions-compliant: Essar CEO Prashant RuiaTrading houses have been investing in physical assets such as mines, ports, terminals and refineries to diversify their operations away from being mere middle-men buying and selling commodities. Vitol, the largest independent trader, owns stakes in refineries with a total capacity of about 390,000 barrels per day. Gunvor, which once dominated the trade of Russian seaborne crude, owns three refineries in Europe with total daily capacity of about 306,000 barrels.Fully compliantIn exchange for its investment, Trafigura is expected to increase its share of crude supplied to the Vadinar complex, which is designed to run on heavy Iranian or Venezuelan crude. Trafigura is also expected to handle more of the products including diesel and gasoline produced at Vadinar, which is Indias second largest refinery.Also Read: Essar Oil sells 98% to Rosneft, Trafigura and UCPTrafigura said that the transaction is fully compliant with international sanctions. The closely held trading house, which is owned by a group of 600 senior employees, has increased business with Rosneft even after the producer and its CEO Igor Sechin were sanctioned by the US in 2014 over Russias role in Ukraine crisis.Using short-term financing arrangements, Trafigura has purchased large volumes of Rosneft crude by complying with sanctions that prohibit lending to the Russian company for periods longer than 30 days.Close relationshipTrafiguras current close relationship with Rosneft began in 2013 when Dauphin and Sechin signed a five-year $1.5 billion prepayment deal in St. Petersburg for the trading house to purchase as much as 10.11 million tons of crude. The deal was far smaller than similar prepay agreements struck with Rosneft by Vitol and and Glencore that same year worth a total of $10 billion.Following record earnings from its oil-trading division in 2015 due to price volatility and a contango market structure that allowed traders to lock in profits by storing oil to be sold later at a higher price, Trafiguras first-half profit fell 10% from a year earlier. Without a one-time gain from a deal in which Angolas government acquired a dormant iron-ore mine, net income would have fallen by 50 percent.The yield on Trafiguras five-year bond due in 2020 widened 10 basis points to 4.42% on Monday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Victoria Dix, a spokeswoman for Trafigura in Geneva, declined to comment further or provide details on the financing structure for the deal.The companys office in Mumbai currently employs about 600 people involved in both metals and oil trading as well as back office and support functions.Trafiguras 49% owned storage and retail business Puma Energy owns two small refineries, including a 20,000 barrel-a-day plant in Nicaragua and a 32,000 barrel-a-day refinery in Papua New Guinea.

Wipros large rivals, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd, run the risk of slower growth this year than the 7.1% and 9.1% growth recorded last year.

Wipros margins had narrowed sharply after it reported 19.7% profitability in the March quarter. Wipros muted 0-2% QoQ dollar revenue growth guidance for third quarter is a disappointment and belies hopes for a turnaround in the core business.

				Accordingly, the share of renewable energy in the countrys fuel mix will increase from the present level of 2% to 8% in 2035. However, the green surge will be inadequate to meet Indias growing need for energy with the countrys demand growth expected to be more than double the non-OECD countries average of 52%.OECD countries refer to the 35 nations that are signatories to the Convention on the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, and mostly comprise mature economies.This comes in the backdrop of investors seeing enormous opportunity in Indias emerging green economy. India, the worlds third largest energy consuming economy after the US and China, plans to achieve 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022 as part of its commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted by 195 countries in Paris in December 2015.The global energy landscape is changing. Traditional centers of demand are being overtaken by fast-growing emerging markets. The energy mix is shifting, driven by technological improvements and environmental concerns. More than ever, our industry needs to adapt to meet those changing energy needs, said Bob Dudley, BP group chief executive in a statement.According to the report, an annual feature published by British energy firm BP Plc, the growth in Indias energy demand is expected to outpace the other so-called BRIC (Brazil, Russia, China, India) countries. Indias energy demand is expected to grow by 129%, while China and Brazils energy demand will grow by 47% and 41%, respectively. Russias energy demand is expected to grow by 2%.Indias energy consumption is expected to grow by 4.2% annually, faster than all major economies in the world. As a result, Indias share of global energy demand will increase to 9% by 2035, accounting for the second largest share among the BRIC countries with China at 26%, Russia at 4%, and Brazil at 2%.Coal remains the dominant fuel produced in India with a 65% share of total production in 2035. Renewables overtakes oil as the second largest, increasing from 4% to 14% in 2035 as oil drops from 10% today to 3% by 2035, the report said.In India, which is the biggest greenhouse gas emitter after the US and China, renewable energy currently accounts for 15%, or 45,917 MW, of the total installed capacity of 3,10,005 MW. According to the government, India has a renewable energy potential of around 900 GW from sources such as wind, solar, small hydro and bio energy.The National Democratic Alliance governments focus on renewable energy stems from Indias energy import bill of around $150 billion, expected to reach $300 billion by 2030.

We lost out on the industrial revolution, we lost out on the defence revolutionlets not lose out in the cyber revolution.ALSO READ: How AI may help you write your new bookWhile other countries have long relied on AI to gather intelligence, Indiasometimes seemingly addicted to paperworkhas continued to use agents to eyeball reams of data gathered over the years. Its a process that sucks up time and can often miss crucial information.India has been in three wars with its neighbours since independence and the target of numerous cross-border attacks, including in 2008 when Pakistan-based extremists killed more than 160 people in Mumbai. Now the threat from cyber attacks is growing and its vulnerability has been exposed.Some 22,000 pages of data related to submarines that a French government-owned company was building for the Indian navy were leaked to the media last year.Opposition leader Rahul Gandhis Twitter account was hacked in November while the elite National Security Guards website was reportedly defaced with profanity-laden messages for Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month.Our idea starting out was that if the next war is fought on cyber, we need our own weapons, said Wig as he talks through software developed for Indias needs. Innefu got a foot in the lucrative business of government contracts after resolving a thorny test case for a law enforcement agency that wanted to determine the background to an incident along one of Indias borders.The agency handed over two CDs with about 1,500 intelligence documents, including social media snippets, such as posts on planned protests. Innefu had to train the machine to read the agencys language, including abbreviations, and then began extracting information on what happened, who were the main players and how they interacted with each other.Its newest offering Prophecy is modelled on products made by Palantir Technologies, a private security firm whose founders include Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel and whose clientele includes the CIA and the FBI. Prophecy is like an octopus with multiple tentacles that pulls data from multiple places, said Wigs co-founder Abhishek Sharma.ALSO READ: AI pioneer Juergen Schmidhuber wants to build the renaissance machine of the futureWhile the use of AI is commonplace elsewhere in Asia, it is still in its infancy in India. About 75% of respondents to a recent survey by consulting firm EY India said cybersecurity deployed in their organisations does not meet their needs, pointing to big opportunities for companies such as Innefu.Although Innefu is the only Indian company known to specialise in national security, other Indian companies such as Arya.ai and Haptik are also tapping what should be a lucrative market. Banks have started to use AI to target products to customers and doctors are using it in a couple of experiments to map a patients medical history in order to devise new lines of treatment.Work is also underway to create a system that can act as a backbone for all electronic warfare programmes for the Indian army. But most of this is still at the laboratory stage, experts say.Its expensive and our society is not used to automated decision-making, Jiten Jain, chief of Indian Infosec Consortium, an industry body, told AFP. Were still used to manual and human decision-making. Subimal Bhattacharjee, a cyber security expert, said India had been caught off guard by the need to upscale its use of AI.We are definitely laggards in comparison to China and South Korea and the US, he said.Innefu operates from the eighth floor of a nondescript Delhi commercial complex that houses chartered accountants and eateries. Its windows are darkened with thick black paper, while clusters of wires sprout from walls adorned with photos of goddess Lakshmi, the purveyor of wealth.But despite its humble surroundings, it is confident an ongoing trial of Prophecy will lead to more business with Indias security serviceswhom Wig expects to be naturally inclined to go local. You cant really trust such sensitive data with foreign companies, said Wig.",2017-01-22,WySodQJkun7yBQl7XTA0JL,"While other countries have long relied on AI to gather intelligence, India has continued to use agents to eyeball reams of data gathered over the years",competitor,17:55,India turns to artificial intelligence as cyber warfare threats grow

				Rapid expansion helped the firm build a brand and scale up during the boom phase in real estate, but size has become its bane now.Small doses of positive news on the sales of non-core assets may have helped support the stock at lower levels. But this has done little to ease the balance sheet pressure and improve operating cash flows for the firm. Consolidated net debt has risen from Rs8,526 crore in  FY14 to Rs22,120 crore at the end of June 2016.Paring this down further requires sales recovery, which is not happening at the desired pace. In spite of news about a slow improvement in the residential real estate market, DLFs  June quarter net sales fell by 21% over a year ago. That was way below what the Street had forecasted.A look at relevant sales parameters over the last eight quarters shows how bad the situation is. The sales pickup is not enough to ease cash flow stress in the near term. Quarterly sales booked have been consistently low at 0.2-0.9 million sq. ft. with a downward bias. In fact, the June quarter had no sales from existing completed projects. On the other hand, Rs270 crore worth of legacy bookings were cancelled.Add to this the huge closing balance of existing projects. Although this has been reducing, DLFs June quarter closing balance was 21.9 million sq. ft. The balance sheet for FY16 pegs the inventory at Rs17,000 crore, which is a grave concern as it is nearly twice the annual sales (including lease income of commercial assets).Perhaps, the main issue is that the National Capital Region, where DLF has a major exposure, is saddled with huge inventory. The company is left holding a massive land bank in a region which may not be of much use in current conditions.According to Santosh Yellapu, senior research analyst (infrastructure) at Angel Broking Pvt. Ltd , DLFs problem is that its residential project operations are faced with negative cash flows. The firm is, perhaps due to regulatory fears, now focusing on completing and delivering existing legacy projects than launching new ones. While this is good, it eats into its cash flows.Meanwhile, investors are patiently waiting for promoters to sell a stake in DLF Cyber City Developers Ltd. The stock gained about 33% since April on this news. Although this sale has the potential to yield a cash inflow that can cut debt drastically, it is only a steady increase in sales of its residential properties which can generate steady cash flows to take DLF into a new growth phase.",2016-09-22,WzEP62AzorLKl8j7OI34aN,"Rapid expansion helped real estate company DLF build a brand and scale up during the boom phase in real estate, but size has become its bane now",competitor,23:38,DLFs size becomes a burden

Since it is a three step merger process and Max Financial Services, which is an NBFC, is also involved in the scheme, Irda wants to ensure that at no stage any amalgamation is happening between Max Financial and any insurance company. So we have to clarify and disclose to Irdai that the non-insurance businesses , such as the telecom business, of MAX Financial Services will be first demerged into Max India and then only the life insurance business of Max Life will be effectively transferred completely to Max Financial Services and subsequently it will be merged with HDFC Life which will result in the automatic listing of the merged entity said a person involved in the merger process on condition of anonymity. Irda had sought the views and recommendation of solicitor general of India a week back and the latest step by Irda has been taken accordingly it seems.

-0.24,"Bengaluru: Indias bid to construct liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers locally under the Make in India plan has collapsed yet again, with state-run natural gas firm GAIL (India) Ltd scrapping a tenderthe second in less than two yearsto hire as many as nine new such ships from global fleet owners to transport gas from the US. 
				   
				Two Japanese-led consortiums had submitted bids before the 15 October deadline set by GAIL, which contended that the two groups had submitted deviations to the tender terms that were not permissible. The bidding groups want GAIL to spare them from paying huge penalties arising from potential non-performance of the Indian-built LNG tankersessentially they want GAIL to assume a larger share of the potential risks on locally built ships. The tender is closed, an official with one of the two bidding groups said, asking not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. It is no longer valid, he said, adding that the government could not decide on a request from GAIL on what to do with the deviations even after the bid validity was extended by a fortnight on 30 September. Confirming the development, a GAIL official said that the company would come out with a fresh tender to hire the ships but whether that will incorporate the stipulation to build part of the ships in India was yet to be decided. These issues are still being discussed, the official said, requesting anonymity. A spokesperson for GAIL could not immediately be reached for comment. A consortium of Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd (MOL)-Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha Ltd (NYK Line) and Mitsui and Co. Ltd and another group comprising Mitsubishi Corp.-Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd (K Line)-GasLog Ltd and Foresight Ltd applied for one of the most sought after shipping tenders globally. The contract, estimated to be worth $7 billion, involved hiring nine new LNG tankers for shipping 5.8 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa) of gas from the US. GAIL will not order the ships directly at shipyardsboth overseas and Indian. It plans to hire the LNG carriers from global fleet owners who will have to construct three of the nine tankers in India as part of the Make in India plan of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In todays market, it costs more than $200 million to build an LNG ship from scratch. Indias state-run Cochin Shipyard Ltd is the only local yard that has fulfilled the eligibility criteria set by GAIL to build the LNG tankers. It has signed a technology collaboration pact with South Koreas Samsung Heavy Industries Co. Ltd to build the LNG ships. It has also secured a licence from GTT, France, to use its patented Mark-III LNG containment systems. Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan told Parliament recently that the first tender issued in 2014 had to be scrapped because none of the qualified foreign shipyards were able to sign binding collaboration pacts with an Indian shipyard for transferring LNG shipbuilding technology when the deadline for submitting bids ended after three extensions. In the second round of tendering, seven of the top global LNG ship owners formed two separate consortia to put in bids. But there were differences between GAIL and the bidders on sharing of risks on Indian-built LNG carriers. The tender terms, according to the bidding groups, loaded all risks on Indian-built LNG ships on to them. GAIL, on its part, was not willing to assume those risks. Make in India can work if both GAIL and the government extend support to the fleet owners, said an executive associated with one of the bidding groups. Make in India is not only one partys headache. GAIL/government cannot say that you are getting business so you take all the risks for Make in India. It has to be a collaborative effort. The government, GAIL and lenders have to come together. You cannot treat a tender at par for LNG ships to be built at experienced South Korean yards and those to be built at an Indian yard for the first time. Wherever LNG carriers are built for the first time, strong support was extended by the governmentbe it in China, Korea or Japan. It does need the support of everybody, the executive said. A shipbuilding executive closely associated with the bidding process, however, said that the concerns raised by the bidding groups on Indian-built ships were unfounded. Cochin Shipyard would build the carriers based on design provided by Samsung Heavy Industries and LNG containment systems licensed from GTT. Hence, the perception on quality and risk concerns expressed by bidders are misplaced, the executive said.

It is one of the best performing companies in UK and Ireland. Their margins are quite high. It is not a distressed asset. Our intention is not to buy a loss-making unit and turn it around. It takes time to reach this position and we would like to be No.1 or 2 in certain markets. With this deal, we will be becoming the No.1 or 2 in UK and Ireland. There is good management attached to it. Also, our own existing business can get the benefit of this strong management.How have you financed the acquisition?We have created long-term debt to fund the acquisition. The balance sheet is strong enough for us to borrow around another $1 billion. We are generating a lot of cash, so in another three to four years, the way we are working, we will be debt-free. So its not a big concern.Our net-worth-to-debt is around 1x, we can go to around 3x to 4x, so it is not an issue at all. Also, right now in the market scenario, interest level globally is very low, if you are talking in pound terms. And there is enough margin in this business. So effective interest cost is low, so it is not a big risk.Was there an aggressive bidding for the asset?I would not like to comment on other bidders. The fact is that such assets dont come in the market too often. Price is not the only criteria. Its an integration of two companies. We have around 250 people in Europe, here we will be taking up to 400 people. Its not just the price, the strategy is more important.What are your quick thoughts on the acquisition?It will increase our Europe presence and will make us either No. 1 or No. 2 in UK and Ireland.

-0.64,"Oil companies are likely to report a decent set of numbers for the December quarter. Singapore gross refining margin (GRM), though lower on a year-on-year basis, has improved sequentially (see chart). Nevertheless, a better refining environment is expected to reflect in the December quarter numbers of Indian refining companies. GRM is a measure of the difference between the per barrel price of crude oil and the value of products distilled from it.
				   
				State-run oil marketing companies (OMCs)Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Indian Oil Corp. Ltdare expected to report a good quarter thanks to a recovery in GRMs and inventory gains. While we assume inventory gains (GRM $1-2 a barrel, marketing segment $1-1.5 a barrel), we think OMCs could surprise, pointed out Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd. OMC stocks have outperformed the BSE Sensex so far this fiscal year. Currently, they trade in the range of about 9-12 times estimated earnings for FY17.For Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), improvement in refining margins is expected to be set off to an extent against muted performance from its petrochemicals business. Analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd expect RILs earnings to be largely flat versus the September quarter. That is because, according to Jefferies, the companys GRM is likely to improve by a more modest $0.7 a barrel to $10.8 a barrel in the December quarter due to a five-week maintenance shutdown at one of its FCC (fluid catalytic cracking) units and sharper improvement in gasoline and fuel oil cracks relative to middle distillate cracks. Middle distillate products account for a relatively higher share of RILs product slate.Secondly, the companys blended petrochemical margin has been slightly lower last quarter. Further, the impact of currency demonetization needs to be watched on the petrochemicals segment. Management commentary on the telecom business and updates on downstream projects will be crucial for the RIL stock, which has underperformed the benchmark Sensex so far this fiscal year.Meanwhile, earnings of upstream oil companiesOil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd and Oil India Ltdare expected to benefit from the strength in crude oil prices. On the flip side, some of those gains are likely to be offset by the 18% cut in domestic gas price. Shares of both companies have fared well this year but the outlook seems tough. In a report on 7 January, analysts from Religare Institutional Research said oil prices need to average well above $60 a barrel for any significant upside in earnings and valuations of these companies.",2017-01-11,XiroHkvD7C3oLzYUewhK3I,"State-run oil marketing companies Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum and Indian Oil are expected to report a good quarter thanks to a recovery in GRMs, inventory gains",competitor,07:53,Expect a decent December quarter from Indian oil firms

				The 42-year-old professor of finance at New York Universitys Stern School of Business starts his three-year term as deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India on Friday, where hell take on the key portfolios of monetary policy, market operations and research.With governor Urjit Patel eschewing the spotlight since taking over from his rockstar predecessor Raghuram Rajan, investors will be looking to Acharya for guidance on how the RBI will get growth back on its former world-beating path. Longer term, the keen musician and expert on Indian financial markets faces the challenge of modernizing capital markets and institutions in a nation where as many as 600 million people dont have a bank account.Why a cashless economy is still a fantasy for IndiaAcharya will take a seat on the Indias newly formed Monetary Policy Committee, which has in the past two meetings voted unanimously to cut interest rates in October and then to hold rates in December  both decisions taking markets by surprise. Meanwhile, pressure is increasing on the central bank to counter the slowdown by easing monetary policy in coming months.Bad bank debtsIndia is at an exciting but challenging time, Acharya said in a statement last week released on the NYU Sterns website. As one of the worlds fastest growing economies, India has the massive potential to become an economic powerhouse.Acharya, described as an outstanding and prolific scholar by the Dean of NYU Stern, Peter Henry, has authored research papers and articles on subjects, from analyzing systemic risk in the European banking sector to the health of Indian state-run and private banks. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Acharya said the government should consider allowing healthier private sector banks to buy the branch networks of distressed state-run banks as a way of preventing bad loans from festering.Bad debts at Indian lenders, especially those in the dominant state-run sector, have climbed to a 14-year high, and are expected to rise further as an economic slowdown makes it harder for banks to recover loans.Markets expertThere is a recognition that Indias capital markets need development, said Shilan Shah, Singapore-based India economist at Capital Economics. Certainly with his expertise, we can look forward to further reforms in the marketplace.Bankers and analysts also expect the RBI to ramp up its faltering communication strategy after Acharya, who is described as affable by friends, takes charge. The RBI has come under increasing flak, with several ex-central bankers criticizing its approach.A cloak of secrecy continues to shroud Prime Minister Narendra Modis currency ban decision and that has led to a view that authorities were not prepared for such a move. With the RBI top-brass making only occasional appearances and choosing not to explain its many flip flops, concerns over the central banks independence have gained ground.The RBIs largely silent approach is not very judicious and only adds on to concerns about the government undermining its independence, said Priyanka Kishore, Singapore-based lead Asia economist at Oxford Economics. Acharyas appointment will be a breath of fresh air.

				Indias largest consumer packaged goods maker said on Monday that sales volumes declined 4% from a year ago in the three months ended December. Net profit was higher because of one-time gains.HUL management told television channels that while things are looking better, it expects the recovery will be gradual.The volume decline accelerated from the 1% fall in the September quarter as customers cut back spending even on essentials following the cash crunch triggered by the scrapping of high-value banknotes on 8 November.During the quarter, the squeeze in liquidity resulted in reduced trade pipelines and lower consumer offtake. The impact was varied across segments, channels and geographies, said P.B. Balaji, chief financial officer, HUL.As such, the impact has been much more in geographies such as central India as compared with the south and west. Rural markets were hurt more than urban ones as expectations of a recovery led by normal monsoon rainfall after two years of drought were dashed by the note ban.The company said it responded to these adverse market conditions with speed by rejigging its supply chain and extending credit to its distribution partners. Management said the cash-led wholesale part of the trade channel was still facing stress.Some analysts such as Sanjiv Bhasin of India Infoline Ltd are optimistic. Bhasin expects the sector to stage a rebound as more cash comes back into circulation.We have to take this (the results) with a pinch of salt as there is the demonetization impact and also higher raw material prices that the company and sector is grappling with, said Bhasin. HULs revenue fell 1.24% from a year ago to Rs8,226.5 crore in the December quarter. The fall in revenue was lower than the volume decline as the company hiked prices of some personal care and home care products, mainly due to commodity price increases; palm oil and crude oil prices have risen sharply.Personal care segment sales, which contribute almost half of its revenue, fell 2.7% to Rs3,980.17 crore.Realization improved because of change in mix and some price hikes. The price hike taken could be around 4%. In fact, price hike would have been much more if this quarter would not have been affected by demonetization, said Sanjay Manyal, senior research analyst, ICICI Securities Ltd.HUL management said consumers were buying smaller quantities but at more frequent intervals. It added that the so-called premiumization (or consumers buying premium products in the same category) wasnt affected in the December quarter.As sales fell and costs went up owing to higher input pricesespecially vegetable oil and crude oil pricesHULs operating profit fell 5%. Analysts expect prices to continue increasing on the back of higher commodity costs in the quarters ahead.On the flip side, because commodity prices are rising, it may work as a lever to provide growth in terms of price hikes, said Manyal.Despite the fall in operating profit, HULs net profit rose 6.83% to Rs1,037.9 crore in the quarter, thanks to one-time income from the sale of properties.Shares of HUL gained 0.25% to close at Rs863.25 on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex rose 0.31% to close at 27,117.34 points.Isha Trivedi contributed to this story.",2017-01-23,XmDA7WpfHT6UXQb4fsGJoM,"HULs net profit rose 7% to Rs1,037.93 crore for the 3rd quarter aided by one-time gains even as sales volumes fell 4%",competitor,17:03,HUL results reveal demonetisation impact

				The 78-year-old Tata is now part of the selection panel that has been asked to search the next chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, the groups main holding company, within next four months and he would also serve as interim chairman in this period.Also Read: Cyrus Mistry ousted as Tata Sons chairman, Ratan Tata steps inA low-profile man to the extent of being reclusive, Mistry, 48, was a surprise choice to succeed Tata, who retired on 29 December, 2012 as chairman of the one of the countrys oldest business empires. The only second non-Tata to take charge of the group after Nowroji Saklatvala in 1932, Mistry by virtue of his age came in with a lot of promise, specially of continuity when he became chairman of Tata Sonsthe promoter of the major operating Tata companies at the age of 44. However, in nearly four years since he took over the reins of the salt-to-software conglomerate, Mistry had to face many challenges in both domestic and global markets as many of the group companies faced headwinds. He undertook a strategy of divesting assets in contrast to what his successor did. Significant among them is the groups steel business, specially Tata Steel Europe. Earlier this year, the company had completed selling of the European long products business in the UK as well as a mill in France to Greybull Capital. It had also announced plans to sell its UK operations after years of losses, although the company is yet to finalize the sale. In July, Tata groups hospitality firm Indian Hotels Company Ltd (IHCL), which runs Taj Group of hotels, completed sale of Taj Boston hotel for $125 million (about Rs839 crore). The hospitality firm had also sold off 12.7 lakh shares of Belmond (earlier known as Orient Express, which the Tata Group tried unsuccessfully to acquire in Ratan Tatas time) for a consideration of $11.96 million. IHCL had also sold BLUE Sydney, a Taj Hotel, to Australia Hotels & Properties Ltd for AU$ 32 million (nearly Rs179 crore) in 2014. The Tata group is also engaged in a legal battle with Japans Docomo over the split of their telecom joint venture Tata Docomo. Contrary to these developments, Tata led the group into some notable acquisitions, starting from Tetley by Tata Tea for $450 million in 2000 to steelmaker Corus by Tata Steel in 2007 and the landmark Jaguar Land Rover in 2008 for $2.3 billion by Tata Motors.

When Mistry took over, the Tata Group had a revenue of $100.09 billion in 2011-12. Since then, the groups revenue grew to $103 billion in 2015-16. About 66% of the equity capital of Tata Sons is held by philanthropic trusts endowed by members of the Tata family. The largest of these trusts are the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Sir Ratan Tata Trust, which were created by the families of the sons of Jamsetji Tata, the founder.

-0.03,"Have start-ups in India become too sexy? Yes, in the opinion of Kishore Biyani, the 56-year-old founder and group chief executive of retail giant Future Group. Biyani, speaking on Wednesday at The Economist India Summit in New Delhi, also said he thinks, according to multiple media reports, that 90% of the countrys start-ups are not going anywhere. They are hopeless, he says, according to a PTI report.
				   
				To be fair, up until a few months ago, it did feel a lot like a wild party was underway in Indias start-up market. A lot of that had to do with the copious amounts of capital sloshing around. Everybody was in the mood to talk up start-upsinvestors, entrepreneurs, the media, even the government. The exuberance on all fronts, except maybe for the government, has lately died down with the advent of a correction in the funding market.But heres the thing. Correction or not, theres very little thats sexy about starting up in India. Especially for first-generation entrepreneurs, against whom much of Biyanis ire is directed. Funds are scarce. There are just about 20 active venture capital firms in the country and less than five venture debt firms. Compliance is still a nightmare and then there are horrors like a tax on capital raised from angel investors. There are middlemen to deal with at every step in any business. And socially, it still remains far from acceptable compared with most other career choices. Even within hip start-up hubs such as Bengaluru, Mumbai, Gurgaon and New Delhi.Yet, every year, more and more people from predominantly middle-class backgrounds take the plunge and start up. Some quit jobs that pay reasonably well. Others start straight out of college. By software industry lobby Nasscoms estimates, there are currently over 5,000 technology start-ups in the country, funded or not by venture capital. More than 90% of such ventures are indeed doomed for failure. Often within a year of starting up. The high failure rate isnt specific to India. Its the standard anywhere in the world where entrepreneurs, usually first generation, have tried to disrupt traditional markets.Whats important to remember, though, is that it takes only the surviving 10% to make all the difference. Lets set aside the e-commerce sector, everybodys favourite whipping boy these days, for the moment. Instead, take the example of the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry. Indias BPO start-ups were born in the shadow of the dotcom bust. Out of the hundreds of BPO companies that started up at the time, 90% failed or wound down operations due to lack of funds. But the less than 10% that survived, among them Daksh eServices (acquired by International Business Machines Corp.), Spectramind (bought by Wipro Ltd) and Customer Asset (acquired by Firstsource), became the foundation for a $25 billion industry, turned India into the worlds back-office, and now employs millions of people.Coming to e-commerce, the poster child of the current start-up wave in the country, theres no doubt that theres been some excess in terms of the capital that has been gobbled up by start-ups in the space. Most of that money has in the past chased valuations rather than profits and many in the start-up ecosystem fear that the irrational exuberance that existed could still prove costly in the long term. It doesnt help that a certain e-commerce company in Bengaluru, that seems to be losing value, on paper, ever too frequently these days, is perceived as being on the verge of collapse.Yet, despite those drawbacks, the verdict is still out on e-commerce start-ups and the overall well-being of the start-up ecosystem. The correction in the market has ensured that tourist entrepreneurs, as one venture capitalist in Mumbai put it half in jest, are being weeded out. As long as the 10% who survive continue to push through, it will be more than enough to prove that start-ups have and will always matter. As for Biyani, Alok Goyal, co-founder of recently minted venture capital firm Stellaris Venture Partners, summed it up best in a tweet on microblogging platform Twitter, He (Biyani) should be worried about the remaining 10%!Snigdha Sengupta is a consulting writer with Mint.

				Edited excerpts from an interview:What is your assessment of demonetisation?Why it happened and whether it was right or wrong is all over now. I think a few things need to be done now. First is of course moving towards the cashless economy. So more digital payment and more transactions is one thing that should happen and I think some of the impediment against it in terms of additional cost involved... taxes should ease. The other thing is because of so much money coming in,  banks have responded and reduced the interest rates by 1 percentage point. There has never been a 1% cut.  I believe over a period interest rates should ease further. The third thing is that some sectors, which were not in mainstream, which were unorganized, will now become organized . The number of taxpayers will increase and so will the governments revenues, and, eventually, its spending. There should be increase in investments. There should be a further easing of tax rates. We need phase two of ease of doing business, be it tax, licenses or regulations.How easy do you think going cashless will be for Indian trade?It takes time to change anybodys habit. It will require sustainable effort in terms of educating people, pushing them and creating some kind of incentive for them to move towards it. How would you rate  2016, from the point of view of the Indian economy and businesses and what do you think lies ahead in 2017?So in 2016, we could get to a close to 7% growth and that was good. By and large industry has done well. Going forward we need to get away from the short-term impact of demonetisation. We have to undo it which means there has to be some more effort towards increasing demand in 2017. So that we can regain whatever we have lost. The Brexit vote happened in 2016 but Brexit has not yet happened; similarly, Donald Trump has been elected but what he will do, we will get to know now. It is difficult to say what kind of impact these will have. Brexit could be positive for India because UK might have to partner with other markets. When do you see things returning to normal after demonetisation? I think things are easing out already. Many of the sectors are normalizing.  I believe some more banking reach in rural areas is essential. I believe that by the end of March, we should see normal growth, or even better.What are your expectations from the goods and services tax?  GST needs to happen, there is no other way.

-0.28,"The economic reform process which began dramatically over a few days at the end of July 1991 was a massive collective achievement in a country where any change for the better is stymied by the enemy within. And the plethora of books marking 25 years of that start has been enormously educative in taking us through the internal parlays, and in a few cases subterfuge, which together made it all happen. 
				   
				It is a well-worn cliché to say that the 1991 package was incomplete, and intellectually flawed (which it was), but what we now need is to pick up each thread of the impossible skein of controls wrapped around the Indian economy pre-reform, and see how it has fared over the years, and where it lies right now. We need to recognize that a second important reform impetus happened over 1999-2001 which sprung loose some tightly wound threads, and further straightened out those that had been unwrapped in 1991.Then there were reform initiatives which were talked about in 1991 but not actually introduced at the time. One such is the goods and services tax (GST). The tax reforms committee of 1991, chaired by Raja Chelliah, was tasked in its terms of reference only to look at taxes levied by the centre (this was part of the larger problem of neglect of state participation which characterized that first round of reforms). Even so, it said (para 9.3 of the interim report): It would be ideal if there were one comprehensive VAT (value-added tax) replacing the present system of Central excises, the State sales taxes and other indirect taxes except the State levy on alcoholic liquor... The GST was a brainchild of the fiscal reforms of 1991 although the committee didnt call it by that name.   The constitutional amendment to enable GST finally cleared the Rajya Sabha on 3 August, but the amendments to the bill to make that possible mean that it will have to pass through the Lok Sabha again. Then the GST bill to operationalize the tax will have to be passed, probably only in the next session of Parliament. The tortuous path of GST is possibly the only example of a reform initiative which has actually gained from its extended delay (with the exception of recent segments of it). It was sensible to first attempt value-added taxation separately in the indirect taxation sphere at the centre (the first tentative moves of which happened with MODVAT, or modified value-added tax in pre-reform 1986), and in the sphere of states (begun in 2005 in most states), before attempting to merge the two. Much will now depend on the GST network, a special purpose vehicle appointed to smooth out glitches in the information technology channels so that taxpayers can make their GST payments through a single window. The Compensatory Afforestation Bill of 2016, finally passed in the Rajya Sabha on 28 July, a long time after its passage through the Lok Sabha, is somewhat different from GST. Here is a case which completes a reform begun even earlier in 1980, where nothing whatever has been gained from the delay. On the contrary, there has been only profoundly irreversible loss. This will be fully acknowledged even by those opposed to diversion of forested land to commercial uses such as dams, which was made legally permissible by the Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980, subject to prior approval from the Government of India, and subject to payment of a prescribed sum for compensatory afforestation. Given that enactment, and given that land has already been diverted under its provisions, and compensation paid, even those opposed to forest land diversion will surely agree that such compensation should be actually used for afforestation instead of being locked up as unutilized funds. Which, believe it or not, was the situation until the recently moved bill. If those funds had been ploughed in at the time they were collected, we would actually have fully grown forests in place. What we can hope for at best now, after the bill is passed, is maybe saplings in a years time. Time lost. Environment disprotected. Irretrievable loss.A Supreme Court order dated 30 October 2002, in its judgement on a writ petition, mandated that the amounts payable under the 1980 Act should be deposited in a Compensatory Afforestation Fund. A further Supreme Court direction, dated 5 May 2006, required that in the absence of a formally legislated Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) of the kind that will now come into being with the passage of the 2016 bill, an ad hoc CAMPA be created at the Centre to centrally pool the money recovered on behalf of the said Authority lying in the States and Union territories. This suggests that between 2002 and 2006 the sequestered funding lay where it was collected, at state-level, and that between 1980 and 2002 the unsequestered funds were merged with the general budget under the general head of non-tax receipts, and dealt with, productively or otherwise, by states. Subsequent to the 2006 Supreme Court direction, the money was pooled in an ad hoc CAMPA fund at the centre. Not all was hoardedsome was indeed distributed to states, in proportion to jurisdictional collections. A report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG Report No. 21 of 2013), reports that the annual amount released from the central ad hoc CAMPA to states over the three years 2009-12 amounted to nearly Rs.3,000 crore in aggregate. Even so, the amount remaining at the centre for distribution between states, as mentioned in the preamble to the 2016 bill, is Rs.38,000 crore. This is presumably the collection since 2002, since before that nothing was being accumulated. The sum represents the total collected under several heads covering compensatory afforestation and penalties levied on those who did not take prior approval, added to the net present value of the diverted forest land or cultivated catchment area. Thus the loss in not having used this fund towards afforestation earlier is truly enormous. All that can be hoped for now, going forward, is that the monitoring mechanism proposed in the bill will ensure productive use at ground level of the accumulated funds. As for funds payable on further diversion of forest land, the 2016 bill will hand over 90% of compensatory funds received directly to states. However, the CAG report referred to above presents a very discouraging picture of state capacity to use afforestation funds effectively. The overall utilization by states of funds released over 2009-12 was as low as 61%. Even more worryingly, the utilization rates were lowest in states with high forest cover such as Arunachal Pradesh (9%), Chhattisgarh (33%), Himachal Pradesh (59%) and Meghalaya (0%).What reform has failed to do in every sphere is to improve government capacity for expenditure. Monitoring mechanisms to prevent misdirection of government expenditure merely result in obstructing expenditure altogether. Even in the 2016 bill, the steering committee mandated at state level is chaired by the chief secretary. The time and attention of the senior-most civil servant in the state, thought necessary to secure every process from corruption, becomes so thinly stretched as a result that procedural delays become the norm rather than the exception. Government processes remain substantially unreformed. The accumulation of unspent funds for afforestation, and the low level of utilization of even such funds as were disbursed to states for the purpose, is only a small part of the larger problem of unspent funds (float) lying with governments in all departments. A. Santhosh Mathew, a government officer belonging to the Indian Administrative Service, has written widely to demonstrate how this results from the antiquated system of layered file-based certification of fund utilization. He estimates that a third of reported government expenditure lies parked, unused. A workflow based IT platform for each expenditure programme, such that funds can be transferred in real time from the funding source directly to the point of expenditure, can get rid of this problem of unspent funds. To quote him: a synchronized effort to adopt IT systems across government simply means a dramatic reduction in fiscal deficit, more money for lending to the private sector, a more efficient public financial management system, and a more reliable government to conduct business with.The only reservation I have is that where government systems have been shifted onto automated platforms, automation is typically done through a tender process that selects private players working on wafer-thin margins, who run their systems with poorly paid operators, and face high employee turnover. Add to that problems with electricity, and you have systems that have users tearing their hair in frustration. Very often automated systems ask that users use the manual channel in addition, which then renders redundant the very purpose of automation. But automation with a provision for continued correction through interface with users is clearly the direction in which to move.

0.08,"San Francisco: America just endured its first presidential election in which the majority of the electorate got its news from social media. And the outcome is already prompting soul searching by the companies that shaped it.
				   
				Facebook Inc. will have to contend with mounting dissatisfaction over its role as the most widely used news filter in history. Forty-four percent of American adults get their media through the site, many consuming news from partisan sources with which they agree. The proliferation of fake news on Facebook has also been a problem: false stories about the Clinton family committing murder and Huma Abedin being a terrorist flew fast and furious despite refutations from responsible news organizations. Those stories shaped public opinion, said Ed Wasserman, the dean of the University of California, Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism.This is a landmark, he said. Trump was able to get his message out in a way that was vastly influential without undergoing the usual kinds of quality checks that we associate with reaching mass public. You had a whole set of media having influence without really having authority. And the media that spoke with authority, the authority that comes after careful fact checking, didnt really have the influence.In a statement, a Facebook spokeswoman said: While Facebook played a part in this election, it was just one of many ways people received their information  and was one of the many ways people connected with their leaders, engaged in the political process and shared their views.Online (on Facebook, of course), current and former employees debated the companys role as an influencer. Bobby Goodlatte, a Facebook product designer from 2008 to 2012, according to his LinkedIn, today said the companys news feed was responsible for fueling highly partisan, fact-light media outlets that propelled Donald Trumps ascension to the presidency. News feed optimizes for engagement, Goodlatte wrote. As weve learned in this election, bullshit is highly engaging. In the past, Facebook has pushed back publicly against these concerns with a simple premise: News feed is just an amplification of what people would experience in a world without it. In response to Goodlatte, Andrew Bosworth, a veteran Facebook executive who helped create news feed, defended the company: News feed isnt perfect but it is at least or more diverse than the alternatives which dominated consumption in the late nineties.Behind the scenes, Facebook has been studying and analyzing its effect on news consumption. The issue was tackled at high-level meetings this summer, leading to a revision of priorities for news feed to de-emphasize media posts, in favour of posts from friends and family. The companys public relations department has worked to frame Facebook as a technology company rather than a media company, celebrating the invention of news feed on its 10-year anniversary, for example. Meanwhile, Facebook intensified its analysis of its role in creating an echo chamber and spreading fake news.We cant read everything and check everything, Adam Mosseri, the head of news feed, said in an August interview. So what weve done is weve allowed people to mark things as false. We rely heavily on the community to report content.Of course, if false news is spreading in communities that want to believe it, few will mark it as false.Echo chambers on Facebook may have helped Trump win, but Twitter Inc. gave him a way to reach American voters constantly and without an editor. Clinton also had her own Facebook and Twitter accounts, but Trump, with almost 14 million followers on the site, would often start his own news cycles with deeply opinionated and often incendiary posts. I cant think of another instance, in commercial or political communication, where Twitter was used as effectively, Wasserman said.Twitters shares rose 4.1% on Wednesday, boosted by investor recognition of its role in the election outcome. But it hasnt all been good for the company. As Trump rose on the platform, so did a set of racist, misogynist harassers supporting him, and that caused a major headache for the company. These trolls, not officially endorsed by the campaign, would regularly attack Trumps critics, in many cases causing Twitter users to feel unsafe. The clashes highlighted Twitters inability to effectively address abuse on its platform  a problem that was one reason The Walt Disney Company walked away from a potential bid for the social media site.Twitters executives, when asked about these issues during the election, said that the site is a place for all ideas. If false information or hateful rhetoric surfaces, others on the site will tweet in response.We have the world talking on this thing about the world, chief executive officer Jack Dorsey said in an interview earlier this year. So we see every spectrum of idea and conversation.Twitter didnt respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.

				Growth in data revenue fell to 27% on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, from 34% in the March quarter and 45% in the December 2015 quarter. In the mainstay voice business, average realization per minute improved for the second consecutive quarter, due to a reduction in promotional offers. But this strategy backfired as far as volume growth was concernedvoice volumes fell by 1% sequentially. On a y-o-y basis, voice volumes grew by just 1.8%. We have found Ideas dynamic management of the price-volume equation in the voice business impressive in the past; however, we do believe the company has not managed to strike the right balance of late, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients. In all, revenue grew by 8% y-o-y. At the same time, thanks to a vigorous expansion in its data network coverage, network operating costs rose by 16% y-o-y. Profit margins naturally fell. Adjusted for one-offs, Kotaks analysts estimate Ebitda margins fell 90 basis points y-o-y. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. A basis point is 0.01%.Profit after tax slumped 65%, which was more or less on expected lines, as interest costs almost tripled on network expansion, spectrum renewal and acquisition costs. Tracking the rise in capital expenditure and finance costs, analysts were forecasting a fall in profit. Still, the results have disappointed. While slow revenue growth and a sharp rise in costs weighed on the June quarter performance, the pressure on Idea Cellulars earnings may continue to keep investors on the edge.Hopefully, the company will change tracks with its pricing strategy and voice volume growth may come back on track. Slowing data volume growth is a big worry, however, especially keeping in mind the large amount of investments the company has made in the segment.

				The company with 86 megawatts of wind power in India and another 78MW under development is the latest investor to complain that some Indian power retailers are stifling investment and undermining Prime Minister Narendra Modis green-power ambitions.The power distribution companies, called discoms, are months in arrears in some places and are seeking to limit the amount of renewable energy they buy because electricity from fossil-fuel generators is cheaper.If the discom risk wasnt there, we could have easily built about 400 to 500 megawatts of additional wind projects, Glen Reccani, managing director of Accionas Indian unit, said in an interview. How do you fit that into your business model?The delays matter because theyre stalling Indias $200 billion plan to more than quadruple wind and solar capacity. Modi wants wind and solar power to supply 200 gigawatts of power by 2022, up from 45GW at present.These discoms are paying conventional generators but they havent paid wind from July 2015 onwards and are actively discriminating against wind generators, said Sumant Sinha, founder of ReNew Power Ventures Pvt.

Officials from discoms in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu didnt return phone calls seeking comment.According to Indias Wind Independent Power Producers Association, developers with almost 8GW of installed capacity in states are facing payment delays and lack power-purchase agreements.We have the financial wherewithal to keep the debt servicing current, but a lot of the smaller guys dont and with this problem non performing assets are creeping in for some of the generators in Maharashtra, Sinha said.Bridge loansReNew Power said 360MW of wind power in Maharashtra, 150MW in Rajasthan and 100MW in Madhya Pradesh are affected by payment delays, impacting 35% of the companys revenue.Cash-squeezed investors are being forced to use equity to pay off loans and then seek a bridge loan for new or pending projects, according to Sunil Jain, the president of the wind association.Bankers realize if youre not getting paid for the old projects, how will you get paid for the new ones, and become reluctant to give loans, Jain said in a phone interview.Wind generators are turning to bridge loans to balance obligation with the delays, according to Ashok Haldia, who heads PTC India Financial Services Ltd.Interest rates on such loans are higher than the project loan normally by up to 2 percent, Haldia said in a phone interview.

-0.07,"Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is likely to report a gain in  quarterly profit as a strong performance in its refining business may help offset weaker petrochemical margins. 
				   
				Net profit, excluding those of its units, may increase to Rs7,842 crore on a revenue of Rs65,752.6 crore for the three months ended 31 December, according to a Bloomberg survey of 11 analysts. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported a profit of Rs7,218 crore on revenue of Rs56,567 crore. RIL will announce its third-quarter earnings on Monday. At 9.15am, RIL was trading at Rs1,091.40 on BSE, up 0.11% from previous close while Indias benchmark Sensex Index rose 0.01% to 27,238.35 points.We expect this to be the eighth consecutive sequential earnings increase. Strong refining should more than offset the likely weaker pet-chem segment (weaker margins, and likely impact of demonetization), Nomura Research said in a 5 January note to clients. Analysts expect RILs gross refining margin (GRM) to be between $10.5 per barrel and $11.5 per barrel. GRM is the realization from turning every barrel of crude oil into finished products. Reliances GRM is likely to improve by a more modest $0.7 per barrel to $10.8 per barrel in third quarter due to a five-week maintenance shutdown in one of its fluid catalytic cracking units and sharper improvement in gasoline and fuel oil cracks relative to middle distillate cracks, brokerage Jefferies India said in a 4 January note. During the quarter, benchmark Singapore complex margins increased by $1.5 per barrel sequentially to $6.7 per barrel. RILs petrochemical business is estimated to report a drop in EBIT on overall weaker margins, planned shutdown and impact of demonetization. EBIT stands for earnings before interest and taxes and is an indication of a companys profitability. Petchem will be impacted by demonetization and lower spreads. Consequently, we estimate EBITDA to dip 6% quarter-on-quarter, Edelweiss Securities said in a 6 January note. During the December quarter, RIL commissioned the first phase of its paraxylene capacity. Analysts expect RILs new refining and petchem projects to add to earnings from the second half of FY18-19. On the exploration and production front, RIL is likely to report a small loss. US shale will continue to remain loss-making. Crude oil prices are higher year-on-year but domestic gas prices are lower. KG D6 production is expected to be down 24% on a YoY (year-on-year) basis. US shale is consolidated with one quarter lag, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a report dated 9 January. Analysts expect the companys telecom business to be a drag on profitability. RIL launched its telecom operations commercially on 5 September. Post its second-quarter results announcement on 20 October, RIL said the company will be investing an additional Rs1 trillion in its telecom venture. RIL has so far invested Rs2 trillion in the venture. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd  (RJio), which launched an inaugural free voice and data plan beginning 5 September, extended it beyond December till 31 March. Over the past one month, competitive intensity has picked up, as incumbent telecom companies have started to offer higher data for free for 4G subscribers and effectively brought down pricing. For RJio, while the number of subscribers it starts operations with is critical, we would also focus on the absolute level of ARPU (average revenue per user).

-0.13,"New Delhi: Economic reform includes freedom of entry, freedom of doing business and freedom to exit a market, says M.S. Sahoo, chairperson of the newest regulator on the fieldthe Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI). He says that the swiftness with which the government set up the bankruptcy framework after the passing of the law is proof that the Centre is pushing for an easier exit strategy for companies. In an interview, Sahoo says the key takeaways from the code will be the development of the debt market, improvement in the ease of doing business and promoting entrepreneurship. Edited excerpts:
Can a change in the ease of doing business rankings 2017 be expected?It should. What is, however, important is the real gain to the economy. For example, this (bankruptcy framework) should change the pattern of financing the enterprises. There are two broad ways of financing enterprises: equity and debt. Today, the share of debt in enterprise financing is below the levels in comparable economies. A key outcome would be improvement in the share of debt in total financing, the share of financial debt, the share of non-bank debt in total debt and the share of unsecured debt in total debt. Another outcome could be the amount of unutilized resources released from defunct enterprises. One should allow reasonable mass of transactions to go through, before evaluating. Has there been effective market demand for the code?I find overwhelming interest from the stakeholders. Within one week of issue of regulations, three insolvency professional agencies were registered. In about a month, 977 insolvency professionals were registered. The limited insolvency examination commenced on 31 December 2016 and people are taking examinations every day. There are a large number of awareness and training programmes happening all over the country. There has been active participation of the stakeholders in making of the code and the rules and regulations. Regulations relating to corporate insolvency resolution came into effect on 1 December 2016. Quite a few cases have been filed before NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal) and a few have already been admitted.What are the regulatory challenges that you are expecting to come up with the implementation of the code?The country has set up several regulatory regimes for different spheres of the economy over the last two decades. The stakeholders understand that the market develops under the comfort of regulations. More importantly, there has been engagement of the stakeholders at every stage of the development of the regime. The Bankruptcy Law Reforms Committee, joint parliamentary committee, working groups of the ministry of corporate affairs and advisory committees of IBBI have deliberated the issues at great length. There have been several rounds of public consultations also. I do not really see any challenge, particularly when there is buy-in from the stakeholders.What are the possibilities of cases like Mallyas happening again?The regime gives an opportunity to the stakeholders at the very first default to take a call and empowers them to take the most appropriate call in their best interests under the circumstances. If one takes note of the alert and acts accordingly, one is unlikely to reach an alarming situation.There is talk about the timeline of 180 days for corporate resolution process. How hopeful are you about keeping to these timelines?The transaction is being undertaken by the stakeholders themselves. And the entire process is under their control. If one is pursuing his own interest, and everything is under his control, in all probability, he would do it well in time. That is why we call it a market-determined process. The state, NCLT and IBBI, are not examining the transaction (resolution plan) on merits. It mostly sees if due process has been followedcommittee of creditors has been properly constituted, there actually has been voting by 75% (of the committee).To make it happen in 180 days, there are certain institutional facilities like the insolvency professional, who guides the stakeholders throughout the process. The other is the information utility which will be the storehouse of all the information that one needs for a transaction. Further, over time, efficient practices develop, and processes get standardized and automated. How soon will personal insolvency regulation be taken up? Will the debt recovery tribunals be overhauled as planned, given their role in personal insolvency? We are now focused on corporate insolvency resolution and corporate liquidation for which NCLT benches are in place. Regulations for information utilities and corporate voluntary liquidation should be through in the next three-four months. Then well start looking at personal insolvency. I am sure that the government is conscious of the imperatives of the code. Please see the commitment of the government to the cause of the code. It pushed down its priority in the waterfall (of claimants in a liquidation process) from the highest category to a category below unsecured creditors. It took less than six months to make the code.Would you agree that theres extensive government control as questions have been raised about it? Should the market be independently allowed to regulate itself?I do not agree. The code puts all transactionsinsolvency resolution, liquidation, bankruptcyin the hands of stakeholders and independent professionals. The government does not have any role in these transactions, except providing a conducive ecosystem that facilitate transactions.We had an existing model. There were some bankruptcy transactions going on (at the time). That is what the market had come up with. That model didnt work. So, a different model is being tried now.",2017-01-27,ZNYHYBhI1u6kUFjr3QWCIK,"M.S.

-0.56,"Investors in Internet start-ups and growth-stage companies have to traverse a strange universe. The closest parallel I can find is the film industry. As a producer (investor), I might have all the right ingredientsa star-studded cast, a fantastic storyline, chart-busting music scores, breathtaking sets and cinematography, and a visionary directorbut whether or not the film does well at the box office is still somewhat of a gamble. You never know whether the reagents are just right to serve up a blockbuster.Except with the Internet start-up, its even worse since there is another twistthe simple fact that there are a bunch of other start-ups with the exact same storyline! This would be akin to several independent production houses producing the same James Bond movie (since they all own the idea or franchise)at the same time and trying to bring it to the market as fast as possible. This means that there are multiple, simultaneous, identical experiments all taking place at the same time, and no one knows who will win.But wait, I hear you say; doesnt the one who is first to the market end up winning since they will have the first-mover advantage? Well, not necessarily. The me too scenario also works. And not just with the Lyfts and Olas who are replicating Uber today. History also shows us this. Yahoo was the first, true large-scale search engine. It was upended by Google, which, apart from having (at the time) a better search algorithm, also quickly added other chemical reagents to the mixfree email, Web hosting, smartphone software, smart glasses and so on. The result? Googles market capitalization, as I write this, is almost 14 times that of Yahoo$517 billion compared to Yahoos $35 billion. I remember burning my fingers by investing in Yahoo prior to the dot-com burst of 2001. The stock first fell like a stoneand then remained at the bottom of the pond for years thereafter, before staging a weak comeback afterwards. Its still around, and is still a great company, but a Google it is not. And as a footnotewhile Yahoo went public in 1996, Google didnt go public until almost eight-and-a-half years later in 2004which in Internet terms is like a day and night of Brahma8.64 billion solar years, to be precise.In the interim, Yahoo, the firm, has had several chief executivesBartz, Morse, Thompson, Levinsohn and Mayer. (That string sounds almost like the name of a white-shoe law firm.) Not so Google, where, though Indias own Sundar Pichai is now CEO, the founding team of Larry Page, Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt agreed to work together for 20 years after the IPO (until 2024). Page handed the reins over to Pichai only last year, but still remains very involved.The same analogy can be drawn with our own earlier generation of labour arbitrage-based start-ups: the technology services firms. Firms like Infosys, Cognizant and Mindtree, while sometimes criticized for the collegiality of their founding teams, have ended up having had the last laugh despite having had to weather financial crises before. All said and done, Infosyslike Cognizant, Tata Consultancy Services and some other large Indian services companies with stable management teamsis now a global champion, and Mindtree is a strong contender in the next rung.Maybe there are lessons to be learnt from this for Indias array of current start-ups, which saw a market arbitrage opportunity to enter the Internet retail space before their larger global counterparts could enter the market, essentially creating the equivalent of Jack Mas Chinese Alibaba. Flipkart and Snapdeals valuations seem to have hit a wall. Much of the publicity associated with this has been focused on the fact that foreign investors, afraid of a global slowdown and unproven business models, have written down their existing investments in the sector and are unwilling to pony up more cash. And the global market leader, Amazon, has entered the Indian market in a big way.The current bearish scenario in international markets will surely change, just as it did post-2001 and then again post-2008, so the trick is just to hold on and fend off Amazons advance until the financial tide turns. Despite recent changes in the law, Amazon is after all not an Indian firm and will face more hurdles than the home-grown rivals. But, meanwhile, instead of signing long-term agreements to work together and weather what is just a simple financial stormso that they can later go public and monetize their holdingsmany senior executives at these firms seem to be using the revolving door.Just like in the movies, you can only have one or two heroes/heroines in the cast. And the same is true of the villains. Similarly each start-up can only have one or two sultans or sultanas, but constancy in the top teams is vital. Google has its Page, Facebook its Zuckerberg, Alibaba its Ma, and Snapdeal and Flipkart have their Bahl and Bansals. But the sultans need to think of Henry Fords maxim when it comes to business: Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success. A series of cameo appearances does not a blockbuster make.Siddharth Pai is a world-renowned technology consultant who has personally led over $20 billion in complex, first-of-a-kind outsourcing transactions.",2016-04-20,ZQFsl3WTYrbJ5oGFrfBQFM,"Each start-up can only have one or two sultans or sultanas, but constancy in the top teams is vital

-0.82,"That there are no nasty surprises from the December quarter numbers of Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC) should please investors and justify the 13% run-up in its shares over the past three weeks.
				   
				To its credit, the home loan lenders net profit grew by 12% to Rs1,701.21 crore for the December quarter, marginally higher than analysts estimates. Indeed, the housing finance company has seen better quarters before with higher profit growth but the latest is not to be sneezed at especially in the wake of the currency withdrawal.The fact that the profit comes on the back of a strong operating performance, with net interest income growing at 17%, and asset quality holding up in the aftermath of demonetisation is enough reason for investors to like the stock. HDFCs shares, which were initially pummelled on demonetisation worries, have gained 13% so far in 2017, shrugging off the initial negative sentiment.The home loan firm seems to have weathered the demonetisation event much like its smaller peers. The currency withdrawal could shave only one percentage point off HDFCs individual loan book growth, which slipped to 15% for the third quarter from the average 16% in the previous two quarters. This is adjusting for the loans sold by the lender. Its non-individual loan book that is largely made of developer loans grew at a faster pace of 17% for the December quarter.But the worry is that HDFCs individual loan book growth has been slowing over the last three years. Its individual loan book growth was as high as 19.7% in  fiscal year 2014, which dropped to 16.8% in FY15 and then to 15.6% in FY16. According to Religare Capital Markets research wing, the home loan lenders individual loan book growth could drop to sub-12% for FY18.HDFCs individual loan book has been its strength and the growth in it outstripped that of the corporate loan portfolio until 2015-16. The push for mortgage loans, healthy rise in real estate prices and the managements focus on individual loans boosted the portfolio over the past years. This year, the share of individual loans in incremental loan disbursals has dropped to 73% in the December quarter from 88% in the June quarter.The lingering effects of demonetisation will perhaps reduce growth in disbursements for another quarter.

				UPI was expected to hit digital wallets when it was launched last August, but the latter have grabbed a lions share of digital payments traffic after Indias demonetization move in November.Now, if the PhonePe-ICICI Bank row isnt resolved quickly, it may discourage people from using UPI, curbing the network effect that needs to play out for the platform to grow fast.ALSO READ | How Paytm cashed in on cash banThe vacillation by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), which created the UPI platform, on the row also threatens to erode the credibility of the platform in the short term, said analysts and people working with NPCI.Earlier this month, ICICI Bank blocked transactions on PhonePe. Then, on Thursday, NPCI directed ICICI to allow transactions on PhonePe. A day later, NPCI reversed its stance and said PhonePe violated UPI guidelines of interoperability.The PhonePe-ICICI issue reflects badly on UPI. One of them needs to blink but both are standing their ground, said Amrish Rau, chief executive of payments firm PayU India.According to Rau, for UPI to realize its full potential, the government will, at some point, have to change the framework in which UPI operates.As such, the NPCI needs to be congratulated for the scale at which they have launched UPI. UPI has done really well in such a short span of time and a lot of it is because of NPCI. But because NPCI is controlled by the big banks, it is up to the government to step in and reduce the fees banks earn on payment transactions. Additionally, they need to allow fintech players to become part of the UPI system, which isnt happening now, said Rau.ALSO READ | Whats ailing UPI and how to fix itNPCI was set up in December 2008 and has 10 promoter banks, one of which is ICICI Bank. PhonePes partner, Yes Bank Ltd, is not one of the promoters. PhonePe has partnered with Yes Bank because of restrictions around which companies can launch on UPI.(The PhonePe-ICICI issue) is a temporary speed bump and it should get sorted out soonbut it was an unnecessary roadblock and is the kind of thing that UPI does not need right now.

Hota, chief executive officer of NPCI, declined to comment for this story.The PhonePe-ICICI row has highlighted the risk of arbitrary action by one player that may end up harming the whole UPI ecosystem.But some analysts said that unless other banks take their cue from ICICI Bank, UPI will continue to increase its popularity with consumers because of its ease of usage. Unlike a digital wallet that needs to be refilled with money frequently, UPI does away with this step by connecting payments directly with the bank accounts of a user.It boils down to a simple fight for the customer that is going online. The fight between ICICI and PhonePe is a manifestation of that and the competition it signifies, said Harish H.V., partner at cosultancy Grant Thornton. If you look at the bigger picture, the inter-operability of the UPI platform ensures that even if one bank is not on the platform, the customer can route it through the platform of other banks.

-0.27,"San Francisco: Apple Inc. reported quarterly revenue that topped analyst projections, fueled by demand for the companys latest and priciest iPhones.
				   
				Apple said sales rose 3.3% to $78.4 billion, with earnings of $3.36 a share in the three months through 31 December. Analysts forecast profit of $3.22 a share on revenue of $77.3 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shares gained as much as 3.5% in extended trading, after the results.We were surprised by the strength of iPhone 7 Plus where we were actually short of supply throughout the quarter. Weve been able to come into supply-demand balance in January, chief financial officer Luca Maestri said Tuesday in a telephone interview.Introduced in September, the iPhone 7 represented a modest update to its predecessor, the 6S, adding water resistance, an improved camera, battery life and processor while retaining similar styling. Expectations are mounting for a more significant upgrade to Apples flagship product later this year, which is the 10th anniversary of the iPhones launch.Apple said it sold 78.3 million iPhones in the final quarter of 2016, generating $54.4 billion in revenue in the period. The average sales price for each iPhone was $695, compared with $691 a year earlier. Analysts had forecast iPhone unit sales of 76.3 million and an average selling price of $688, according to a Bloomberg News survey. That suggested consumers are still eager to snap up Apples latest models, which bodes well for future product launches.The iPhone 7 is our most popular model, chief executive officer Tim Cook said in a conference call with analysts. We saw especially strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which was a higher portion of the new product mix than weve ever seen with Plus models in the past.Since the iPhone 7 Plus base price is $20 more than its predecessor, that boosted the average selling price and offset the impact of some people still buying the older 6S Plus and the cheaper iPhone SE.Sales in the three months through March will be $51.5 billion to $53.5 billion, the Cupertino, California-based company said in a statement. The average estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey was $53.8 billion. Apple expects a gross profit margin of 38% to 39% in the period, while analysts forecast 38.7%.The takeaway is that the top end of their guidance is close to where the street is at, said Gene Munster, a longtime Apple analyst and head of VC firm Loup Partners. The demand for the 7 Plus was strong when they reported the September quarter and that strength carried on into December.Global smartphone sales were largely unchanged in 2016, after years of growth, according to researcher IDC. That puts pressure on Apple because the iPhone generates almost two-thirds of Apples revenue. In addition to churning out new handsets, Cooks response has been to drive adoption of services such as Apple Music, iCloud and the App Store. Services revenue again represented the fastest growing segment, with sales jumping 18% to $7.2 billion in the holiday quarter.Sales in China fell 12% to $16.2 billion, the only region to see a decline. Apple said it generated 64% of its revenue overseas in the holiday quarter.IPad sales continued their slide, declining 22% from a year earlier to $5.5 billion.

Servicing loansLenders to the two steelmakers are also asking the central bank to consider a change to the way it calculates a companys ability to repay debt, one of the people said.

-0.5,"Mumbai/Tokyo/Chicago: The emergence of Shahid Khan, the NFL team owner who made his fortune selling car bumpers, in the race to rescue embattled Japanese airbag manufacturer Takata Corp. pits the billionaire against more established parts suppliers and some of the worlds biggest buyout firms.
				   
				Pakistan-born Khan, 66, migrated as a teenager to the US, where he started washing dishes for $1.20 an hour. He later built Urbana, Illinois-based Flex-N-Gate Corp. into an auto-parts supplier that ranks him among the richest Americans, with an estimated net worth of about $5 billion. Along the way, he bought the Jacksonville Jaguars in Florida and the London-based Fulham Football Club, and landed on a cover of Forbes magazine in 2012 as the Face of the American Dream.Now, Khans bumper-and-headlight maker is one of five suitors for Tokyo-based Takata, which is looking for a buyer after some of its devices ruptured and killed at least 16 people, prompting repairs that could exceed 100 million devices worldwide, according to a person familiar with the matter.Flex-N-Gate, which doesnt make airbags, will go up against established suppliers such as Stockholm-based Autoliv Inc., Chinese-owned Key Safety Systems Inc. and Japans Daicel Corp. Private equity firms KKR & Co. and Bain Capital, partnering with Daicel, are also said to have submitted bids.Automakers may prefer an established company as a buyer compared with Flex-N-Gate, said Kavan Mukhtyar, a management consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Mumbai who has advised on strategy and operations in the automotive industry. But considering its global aspirations, Flex-N-Gate can offer better valuations. And in a deal, valuation plays a critical role.Proposals from Takata buyers are being discussed at meetings scheduled in Japan this week between the supplier and automakers including Honda Motor Co. The central issue for the airbag makers customers is how those takeover bids divide up the responsibility for billions of dollars in recall costs and liabilities.Representatives for Flex-N-Gate and Takata declined to comment on the bids. Flex-N-Gate declined to make Khan available for an interview.Track record
A lack of a track record in making airbags may count against Flex-N-Gate in its bid for Takata, said Koji Endo, an analyst with SBI Securities Co. in Tokyo. Airbags are an area where the margins are relatively high and the hurdles for new entrants are also high, Endo said.Automakers have said ensuring a stable and reliable supply of airbags is one of their top priorities, even as they seek longer-term engineering solutions and to diversify their supplier base.Khan may be able to make up for a lack of experience in airbags with the work ethic thats propelled his career, according to Jim Womack, whos authored several books on lean manufacturing and has spoken with the billionaire about his upbringing in Pakistan.Khan recalled playing golf with his father where fairways were lined with beggars whod throw back errantly hit balls in exchange for tips. Womack said Khan left for America to escape a country where one couldnt lose.Driven guy
He can walk through a factory and have a real sense of whats going on, unlike a thousand CEOs Ive met whove never done what some of us would call real work, said Womack, the founder of and senior adviser to Lean Enterprise Institute Inc. Hes a driven guy. Not an awful guy but hes in this to win.Khan, whose father sold surveying equipment and mother was a math professor in Pakistan, began working for Flex-N-Gate while still an engineering student, according to a profile posted on the Jacksonville Jaguars website.Flex-N-Gate at the time used to make auto bumpers by welding together different pieces. Khan sought and succeeded in coming up with a seamless bumper that would be easier to manufacture, Khan said on stage in 2014 at Chicago Ideas Week.He left the company to set up Bumper Works, which designed and manufactured lightweight seamless fenders, landing General Motors as its first customer, Khan said at the Chicago forum. Two years later Khan purchased his former employer when it came up for sale and folded Bumper Works into Flex-N-Gate.Business expansion
Over the next decade, Khan led the transition of Flex-N-Gate from an after-market parts producer to an original equipment manufacturer. He expanded by acquiring businesses including mechanical assembly supplier Ventra Group Inc. in 2001, the bumper business from Meridian Automotive Systems in 2009 and a headlamps and taillights business from Ford Motor Co.The company counts major automakers including Ford, Volkswagen AG, Toyota Motor Corp. and Suzuki Motor Corp. its customers and operates 54 manufacturing facilities globally.For Khan, buying Takata will give him an estimated 22% global market share in airbags, a business that Autoliv forecasts may expand to $10.3 billion by 2018 from $9.5 billion in 2015, as emerging markets like India catch up with safety standards in developed countries.Acquiring Takata also would allow Khan to diversify Flex-N-Gates business of supplying front-end modules and plastic parts and into higher-margin segments dominated by a few suppliers.Despite its troubles, Takata has technology, long-standing relationships with clients and plays in a field with very few competitors, said Deepesh Rathore, director at Emerging Markets Automotive Advisors in London. For Flex-N-Gate, this is a good opportunity to diversify into a new component segment. Bloomberg",2016-09-29,a92kAmGXZSkm9Q7FmphFXI,"Shahid Khan, the NFL team owner who made his fortune selling car bumpers, is in the race to rescue embattled Japanese airbag manufacturer Takata

0.3,"Mumbai: Three days after the government invalidated high-value currency notes, banks are unable to meet the demand for new replacements or low-value bank notes. As serpentine queues formed outside the entrances of bank branches and ATMs, embattled bank staff bore the brunt of customer displeasure.
				   
				The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) released a statement saying it had made arrangements to distribute the notes in new Rs2,000 and other denominations across the country, but it also appealed to the public to be patient.The cash crunch is so bad that ATMs even in the corporate offices of a bank ran out of cash. A senior banker who declined to be identified said that being senior management, they were given a packet of Rs20 bank notes to tide over the crunch, but even that is proving to be insufficient.The cash is drying up. But we are taking care of it. There is no need to panic, said Arundhati Bhattacharya, chairman of State Bank of India.It is not panic, but desperation that is leading to the ire of customers, many of whom are unable to get cash out of their bank accounts to pay for small purchases, whether for a loaf of bread or vegetables.This is my fourth attempt to withdraw money today. I had to walk all the way down from my home to attend office, said Siddharth Ganguly, 36, who was waiting in front of an ATM.Another customer, Ashutosh Kumar Mishra, 30, said he had to wait for six hours to get Rs4,000 in exchange for the old, demonetized notes.Bankers and companies that manage and deploy ATMs say that they are facing three major issuesshort supply of Rs100 currency notes, under-utilization of ATM capacity and logistic problems. Most ATMs are working at one-third of their capacity. Also, the cassettes that hold cash in the ATMs have to be reconfigured to dispense new notes. The reconfiguration, which requires the deployment of three people on-site, is in testing phase right now. The process of reconfiguring ATMs across the country could take another 20-25 days. Bank of Baroda, for instance, had filled up only 400 out of its 9,000 ATMs till noon Friday, according to its senior management.Bank staff are being denied leave and are working overtime to ensure that at least those who want to deposit their old notes are able to do so. My uncle died today, but I still had to come to work, said a Punjab National Bank branch manager in Mumbai who didnt want to be named.SBI has accepted total cash deposits of Rs39,677 crore over the past two days (till 6pm on Friday) and exchanged cash worth Rs1,666 crore.Bidya Sapam, Gopika Gopakumar, Sahib Sharma and Vishwanath Nair contributed to this story.",2016-11-12,aHSQhb6ApJiAaUuyGa3bWN,"As serpentine queues formed outside the entrances of bank branches and ATMs, bank staff bore the brunt of customer displeasure",both,00:30,"Cash crunch: customers seeking currency swamp banks, ATMs"
-0.56,"Monsanto India Ltd investors seem very excited about the ownership change. They drove up the stock 35% from Bayer AGs first acquisition proposal to Monsanto Indias parent. Shares of Bayer Cropscience Ltd, the acquirers subsidiary in India are, on the other hand, much more mutedthey are up just 5% in a volatile trade. Why the trepidation?
				   
				First, it is not clear how Bayer AG, the acquirer, will go about Monsantos India business. Monsanto operates through three units in India. One is Monsanto India, the listed entity that sells maize seeds and a herbicide product. The second is Monsanto Holdings Pvt. Ltd, which distributes Bt cotton and hybrid vegetable seeds. The third is Mahyco Monsanto Biotech (India) Pvt. Ltd, a joint venture that sub-licences genetically modified (GM) cotton traits to seed companies.There is no clarity yet on what part of Monsantos business will be aligned to Bayer Cropscience and by what time. Or if the two listed firms will be merged at all.Also, even if Bayer amalgamates the businesses, apart from portfolio expansion and distribution leverage benefits, it has limited chance of deriving a sustainable revenue growth driver immediately.All three Monsanto units right now lack growth drivers. The cotton seeds business is facing prospects of price curbs. The existing GM technology is said to be losing efficacy. To keep up the sales tempo, Monsanto tried to introduce new trait seeds (Ready Flex). But it withdrew the application, objecting to the government proposal to share technology with local firms. The withdrawal is not only a setback for the cotton seeds business, but also for the listed company. The new seed trait is tolerant to Monsanto Indias agrochemical product and would have been sales accretive.Of course, the listed company has a  strong presence in corn seeds and is expected to do well this year, which partly explains the share price surge. But its business is turning more cyclicalit is tied to maize crop acreages and lacks long-term growth triggers. The companys average annual revenues grew by an unexciting 7% in the last three fiscal years compared to Bayer Cropsciences 11% growth.Opening of the Indian market to non-cotton GM seeds will be a breakthrough for the listed company and Monsanto Holdings as well, as they have access to these technologies. But approvals have been pending for long. At best, Monsanto India Ltd can see stable to moderate growth. It lacks any big triggers, which can kick in only when it introduces any new seed traits (non-cotton GM technology). But for that, it has to overcome regulatory hurdles, says Vijayaraghavan G., senior vice-president (research) at IDFC Securities Ltd.According to an analyst with another broking firm, the ownership change can bring a fresh approach to regulatory problems, which can help revive Monsantos India business. Even bereft of regulatory cooperation, Monsanto is expected to benefit from Bayers distribution and marketing. As a combined entity, Monsantos India businesses should be able to benefit from the distribution reach of Bayer, adds Vijayaraghavan.Perhaps the perceived benefits are driving the Monsanto stock, be it the prospect of an open offer or leveraging Bayers marketing reach. For Bayer, the gains can be gradual. The stock may not get an open offer. But the company stands a chance to gain an unparalleled economic advantage in the Indian agriculture inputs market if it wriggles out of the regulatory problems, revives the cotton seeds business and introduces Monsantos proprietary products in the domestic market.",2016-09-18,aKPKtFB5SmsYxcKJsLU94N,There is no clarity yet on what part of Monsantos business will be aligned to Bayer Cropscience and by what time,both,22:44,Bayer-Monsanto merger: Limited good if curbs stay
0.41,"Microsofts move to purchase LinkedIn for $26.2 billionthe largest company-for-company acquisition in the technology industry since Hewlett Packards 2002 purchase of Compaqis bringing out the predictable talk of irrational exuberance. But if the deal does indicate a bubble, its not necessarily in tech or in stocks.
				   
				First, the combination actually makes sense on many levels. The companies both cater to older, corporate users, and have similar missions, with Microsoft seeking to enable people and businesses throughout the world to realize their full potential, and LinkedIn to connect the worlds professionals to make them more productive and successful. Putting the two together could allow for some significant cost savings: Microsoft could economize a lot simply by imposing some discipline on LinkedIns profligate use of stock-based compensation, which the social-networking company has forecast at about $580 million in 2016, on revenues of between $3.65 and $3.7 billion.Second, this isnt a typical stock-market-bubble deal. In such transactions, a company with an inflated stock price issues equity to fund the purchase of another company with an inflated stock price, often driving the prices of both companies higher on some kind of 1 + 1 = 3 logic. Microsoft, by contrast, is paying for the deal in cash. The stock market, for its part, has initially reacted pessimistically: Microsofts market valuation has fallen more than LinkedIns has risen, leaving the combined entity worth less than the individual companies were on Friday.For a better sense of where the bubble might be, consider how Microsoft is raising the cash to fund the deal. The money will come entirely from new bond issues, adding about $25 billion to a debt load that has already increased by about $15 billion over the past year:Corporate debt issuance has surged since the 2008 financial crisis for a variety of reasons, including central banks easy-money policies, low or negative interest rates in much of the developed world and foreign central banks more recent moves to purchase corporate bonds directly. In the US, corporate bonds outstanding amounted to 27% of gross domestic product as of March 2016, up from 20% at the end of 2007:To be sure, some of the debt issuance is a form of tax arbitrage: instead of incurring tax liabilities by bringing in cash from abroad to pay for stock buybacks, US tech and pharmaceutical companies are instead borrowing the money at home. That said, when a source of funding is too cheap it will be abused, and excess issuance is generally a big danger sign, whether it involves tech IPOs in the late 1990s, mortgage debt in the middle 2000s, energy debt in the early 2010s or corporate debt today.

-0.91,"Bengaluru: Google parent Alphabet Inc. bested analysts estimates for third-quarter profit and revenue on Thursday as the search company showed it has honed its core business for the mobile era and is closing in on the next wave of computing. 
				   
				Propelled by strong advertising on mobile devices and video site YouTube, Alphabets net income climbed 27% to $5.06 billion. Revenue jumped 20% to $22.45 billion, marking the search giants seventh straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth. The company authorized a $7 billion repurchase of its Class C stock, pleasing investors who had been craving more after a $5 billion repurchase last year. Google is competing fiercely with social network Facebook Inc. for dominance in the fast-growing mobile advertising market. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai touted the companys gains in the space, and was bullish about recent product launches such as the Google Assistant, the Google Home smart speaker and refinements to the enterprise cloud business.The products are aimed at the rise of voice search, which many analysts believe will succeed keyboards and touch screens as a primary way users interact with devices. We feel well positioned as we transition to a new era of computing, Pichai said in an conference call. This new era is one in which people will experience computing more naturally and seamlessly in the context of their lives, powered by intelligent assistants and the cloud.Shares of Alphabet, the worlds No. 2 company by market value, were up 1.6% in after-hours trading.The company posted third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $9.06, beating expectations of $8.63 a share on revenues of $22.05 billion, according to Thomson Reuters estimates.Google has been dogged by concerns about how it would nudge its vast web advertising business towards mobile, but the companys recent performance has reassured Wall Street that the transition is well underway, said analyst Colin Gillis of BGC Partners.Its showing that even though theyve hit lifetime highs, theres still room to run, he said. Advertising revenue, the companys lifeblood, rose 18.1% to $19.82 billion in the third quarter. Paid clicks, or ads for which advertisers pay only when users click on them, rose 33%, compared with a rise of 29% in the second quarter. Cost-per-click, or the average amount advertisers pay Google, fell 11% in the latest period, but investors are willing to forgive the slump for now, as it suggests strong mobile growth, said analyst Kerry Rice of Needham & Co. YouTube continued to post robust gains, Pichai said. Over the past year, Google, Facebook and Twitter Inc. have all doubled down on video, a format where advertisers are willing to pay a premium for a few seconds of users undivided attention. Advertising accounted for 89.1% of Googles total revenue in the quarter, and analysts are eager for the company to tap new sources of growth. One of the leading contenders is Googles cloud business, which drove a 38.8% rise in the companys other revenue.As we head into 2017, I expect cloud to be one of our largest areas of investment, Pichai said. A relatively late entrant to the cloud business, Google is trying to steal market share from industry leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Amazon on Thursday reported a 55% revenue increase in its cloud business.I would hesitate to say they are competing head-to-head, but they are making up for lost ground, Rice said. Alphabets Other Bets unit generated revenue of $197 million, primarily from Nest, Google Fiber and Verily units, chief financial officer Ruth Porat said during the call. Alphabet said this week it was pausing the rollout of Fiber, a high-speed internet service, in some US cities and that its leader Craig Barratt would leave. Porat played down analysts concerns of instability at Other Bets, which has suffered a wave of executive departures, including Nest founder Tony Fadell, self-driving car technology chief Chris Urmson and, most recently, Barratt.As we reach for moonshots that will have a big impact in the longer term, its inevitable that there will be course corrections along the way, and that some efforts will be more successful than others, Porat said.Other Bets, which also includes research unit X, reported an operating loss of $865 million, down from a year-ago loss of $980 million. The narrowing loss suggests Porat is instilling the financial discipline investors have long hoped to see from the company, said Gillis.Everybody loves Ruth, he said.

Indian refining firms had benefited from substantial inventory gains in the June quarter, but that advantage will not be available for the September quarter, as there may not be a major inventory impact considering oil prices have not moved dramatically.
				   
				Whats more, refining margins have inched up only a bit. Benchmark Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) last quarter came in at $5.1 a barrel against $5 a barrel in the June quarter. In short, even though refining margins have risen a bit, lack of substantial inventory gains will mean that reported GRMs of Indian refining firms are likely to be sequentially lower.State-run refining and marketing companiesBharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd are no exception to that trend. On an overall basis, subdued refining performance will more than offset the benefit of robust market margins (calculated diesel retail margins up 32% QoQ) and healthy marketing volumes, wrote Edelweiss Securities Ltd analysts in their September quarter preview. Five brokerage firms previews studied by Mint show  that Ebitda of all three companies is expected to fall against the June quarter. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. But investors are sitting on good gains so far this year. In general, improving profitability, robust product demand and lower crude oil price environment have helped sentiment for these stocks.On the other hand, earnings of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) are expected to be reasonably resilient, Arya Sen and Ranjeet Jaiswal of Jefferies India Pvt.

The brokerage firm estimates RILs stand-alone net profit to increase by 11% year-on-year and only 4% quarter-on-quarter decline, helped by strong refinery throughput and higher petrochemical earnings. Its GRM is expected to be close to $10 a barrel compared to $11.5 a barrel in the June quarter. Updates on its expansion projects and telecom business will be crucial for the stock. The RIL stock has gone up about 8% from its recent low on 2 September following the announcement of the forthcoming commercial launch of services by its telecom unit, at its annual general meeting.Meanwhile, the story continues to be grim for oil producersOil and Natural Gas Corp.

But even after adjusting for the write-down, the estimated net profit at Rs.360-380 crore is lower than Street estimates.
				   
				Sales revenues surged 32%, while average realizations per vehicle improved 3% on a better product mix. The share of higher-priced medium and heavy commercial vehicles in total sales increased from 77% a year ago to 80% last quarter.But the company was not able to fully capture the gains in margins. Gross margins expanded at a slower-than-expected pace of 1.8 percentage points. Ebitda margins increased 2.5 percentage points from a year ago to 12.6%. The Bloomberg consensus brokers estimate had pegged Ebitda margins at 12.8-12.9%. Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, is a measure of profitability.Strong volumes, a favourable product mix and economies of scale should have led to a disproportionate improvement in margins. But these benefits were countered by a sharp rise in other expenses and slower expansion in gross margins. Nevertheless, a slight miss in margins couldnt have led to the sell-off in the stock.What piqued investors is the combination of a huge investment write-down and the unexpected fund-raising plan, through both equity and debt. The company also plans to rationalize its investments during the rest of the fiscal year, which opens the possibility of more write-downs in the coming quarters.Though just an enabling resolution as of now, the fund-raising plan also did not go down well with investors as the requirement is not seen as immediate. More clarity is expected on this announcement, as current operations do not warrant a fund raise, ICICI Securities Ltd said in a note.

A chaotic weekend of protests, emergency court orders and White House rebuttals left executives with a tricky choice: speak out and risk drawing fire from an outspoken president, or stay silent and face criticism from employees and activists.GE chief executive officer Jeff Immelts response underscored the delicate balance business will have to strike. We have many employees from the named countries and we do business all over the region, he said in an internal email. While he called his staff critical to our success, he avoided direct criticism of Trumps policy. GE will continue to make our voice heard with the new administration and congress and reiterate the importance of this issue, he said.Confusion reignedTrumps order shut the door to nationals of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemenincluding refugees, visiting scholars and even permanent American residents who happened to be abroad for work or holidays. Confusion reigned in the first 48 hours of its implementation, with border agents and airlines unsure how to interpret the rules.The decision, termed a Muslim ban by critics, fulfils a campaign promise that even Trump allies had suggested shouldnt be taken literally, signaling the White Houses new occupant is committed to at least some of his most controversial pledges.Also read: Why are the markets cheering Donald Trump?We would never think this would become any kind of an issue, Ludwig Willisch, chief executive officer of North American operations at Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, said at an automotive conference on Saturday. This country is a melting pot, freedom of speech, everybody gets together and creates this great country. So, we were not prepared for this kind of thing.Criticism from pockets of corporate America, which was matched by statements from the leaders of Germany, France, and Canada, stood in stark contrast to the warm words toward Trump just a week ago. Executives at the World Economic Forums annual meeting in Switzerland, including AT&T Inc.s Randall Stephenson and JPMorgan Chase & Co.s Jamie Dimon, praised Trumps promises to overhaul corporate taxes and invest in infrastructure. Optimists suggested he would quietly drop pledges to tear up trade deals and reconsider defence commitments to allies.The about-face was epitomized by Tesla Motors Inc. founder Elon Musk; earlier this week he praised Trumps nominee for secretary of state, former Exxon Mobil Corp. CEO Rex Tillerson, as a potentially excellent pick. On Sunday, Musk asked his 6.89 million Twitter followers to read the immigration order and suggest amendments, which he will then take to Trumps CEO advisory council to develop a consensus and present to the president.Also read: Five global scenarios for the Donald Trump eraOn the other hand, US auto companies, whose home state of Michigan has a large Arab community, have yet to make their views known.Wall Street has also largely stayed out of the fray. At some of its biggest banks, executives said they were struggling to understand whether the order will ultimately apply to employees who work in the US with green cards or legal work permits. If it doesnt hit visa holders, few major companies employees will be affected, according to one executive who asked not to be identified because he wasnt authorized to comment. On Sunday, JPMorgan said it was working to assist affected employees.Starbucks Corp. CEO Howard Schultz said the executive order left him with deep concern, a heavy heart and a resolute promise. The coffee chain will redouble efforts to hire as many as 10,000 refugees over five years in 75 countries, he wrote in a note to employees Sunday.Reaction to the ban was sharpest from the technology industry, with Twitter awash in reminders that Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs was the son of a Syrian immigrant. Among the first to speak out was Google CEO Sundar Pichai, himself an immigrant from India, who called the policy painful. Another India-born CEO, Microsoft Corp.s Satya Nadella, took to LinkedIn to highlight the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, for the world.Trump should expect sustained challenges from the tech industry in particular, said Ian Bremmer, CEO of political consultancy Eurasia Group, because it differs significantly with him on issues from net neutrality to immigration. While most every CEO wants to just get back to business after Trumps election, thats going to prove much harder for technology leaders, he said. Theres going to be a fight.Compounding business leaders unease was the orders confused implementation, which included unclear directives on how border agents should treat lawful permanent residents, and contradictory statements about how it would affect those who hold passports from two countriesfor example, a dual citizen of Iran and the UK.For now, lawyers are advising such individuals not to travel to the US, or to stay put if they already live there. The new rules came into force with no transition period, leaving carriers like Emirates and American Airlines Group Inc. unsure what to do with passengers booked to fly to US airports, or already in the air.We are committed to protecting our people and will provide whatever support is necessary to protect them and their families, Michael Roth, CEO of advertising firm Interpublic Group of Cos., wrote in an email.The moves implications extended far beyond the business world. On Sunday the British long-distance runner Mo Farah, a four-time Olympic gold medalist who was born in Somalia, said he may not be able to return to Oregon, where he trains and lives with his children. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said Oscar-winning Iranian director Asghar Farhadi may be unable to attend this years awards, for which his film The Salesman has been nominated.Trumps order has significant commercial implications, said Allyson Stewart-Allen, CEO of International Marketing Partners in London, who advises European companies on doing business in the US. What do you do with an employee on an executive salary whos sitting in an airport lounge kind of like Tom Hanks in The Terminal? Bloomberg",2017-01-30,bJzpjbBUCghAyZsbb6BibM,What began before Donald Trumps inauguration is now escalating into a crucial test for business leaders trying to maintain cross-border flows of people and goods,competitor,11:09,From GE to Google: The uneasy test of doing business under Donald Trump 
-0.55,"Imagine this: you are travelling for work to London and staying in an apartment rented through Airbnb. As you hail the Uber cab for your business meeting, your phone beeps an urgent message and you swipe your finger on the fingerprint scanner to read the notification. You learn that a critical machine on your shop floor is overheating, and the message tells you that based upon previous experience, it is likely to break down soon. 
				   
				As a precautionary measure, the system has automatically sent a request to the in-house 3D printer to produce the component likely to be impacted. You pull out your Oculus from the briefcase, connect it to the app on the phone and get a visual of the machine and the impacted component. At the click of a button, the system also gives you three scenarios of the impact on the production if the machine goes down. You make the necessary phone calls using the low-cost WhatsApp and speak to the factory manager. Comforted by his response, your mind is clear for your upcoming meeting. What you have just done is leveraging mobile, next-generation security, Internet of Things (IoT), cognitive computing, natural interfaces and analytics technologies to perform a simple but critical management intervention which ensured the smooth running of your business. Welcome to your new world, Ms CEO. A tsunami of new technologies has hit the business ecosystem. The first ripples were felt in the middle of the last decade and were evidenced by the likes of Salesforce.com and that upstart called Amazon Web Services, Inc. What a curious idea it was for an e-commerce company to expose, and rent out, its underlying infrastructure to third parties! IDC predicts a third of all industry leaders will be replaced by 2020. Thats how profound the disruption is. On the consumer side, the waves intensified towards the end of the decade as social media took centre stage and e-commerce boomed in every single major economy in the world. As I write this, Facebook has nearly 1.8 billion users and Alibaba has sold $18 billion worth of products in a single day. Consumer services companies, vividly exemplifying the sharing economy, have become household brands: today, more millennials possibly identify with Uber and Airbnb than they do with venerable corporations such as Johnson & Johnson, and GE. The force of the sharing economy is reshaping vast tracts of the consumer ecosystem, effecting the closure of retail giants such as Circuit City and Woolworths, and acquisitions such as that of Starwood Hotels by Marriott.The waves are swamping those without the lifeboat of digital capabilities.The first intense wave of change came with technologies which created what IDC calls the third platform of computing. The four pillars of the third platform, namely social, mobile, analytics and cloud (SMAC), today aggregate to a market exceeding $0.5 trillion. According to IDC research, its still expected to grow in excess of 13% in 2016, taking more than 35% of overall technology spending. It accounts for 110% of the industrys growth: traditional IT spending, while still two thirds of overall spend, is shrinking at greater than 5% a year. The third platform of computing is a profound shift in the computing paradigm. Users have moved from millions to billions, devices from tens to hundreds of millions and theres enough data generated on Planet Earth to fill up the memory of a stack of Apple iPads all the way to the moon and back. SMAC technologies have transformed IT fundamentally, and opened up entirely new opportunities for businesses. From smart products to analytics businesses and from real-time system enabled mobile field forces to digital supply chains, businesses across the spectrum have embraced these in different ways to drive economic value. The maturing of the third platform of computing has enabled entirely new technologies, and combinations, to develop and mature. IDC collectively calls them the innovation accelerators, as our research identifies their potential to drive not just technology and process but also complete business disruption. Of these technologies, the following five are likely to take centre stage in India in 2017. Watch out for them.Next gen securityIf youre like me and have a continuous wrestling match with your store of forgotten capital letter-alphanumericchange-them-every-two-weeks passwords, then I can give you some comfort. The era of the complicated password will soon pass. Next generation security systems are integrating biometrics (fingerprint, voice, iris recognition) with behavioural analytics (usage location, onsite/on-app behaviour, transaction patterns) to help make bank accounts, health records, government databases and countless other stores of sensitive information ever more secure. Though not visible to most, the security of the networks our data whizzes around on, and of the data centres which power up the modern economy, is also undergoing radical modernization. For example, network security is not just about appliances detecting bad actors anymore: its moving to a managed services model where the network is monitored for bad actors, real-time responses become a reality and damage control processes kick in instantly in the event of a hack. From Apples fingerprint readers to behavioural security platforms being introduced by the likes of Intel Security and Cisco, the industry is racing to help us realize the possibilities these technologies unlock. Expect a new paradigm in security to make life easier, and more secure, for you in 2017 and beyond. Cognitive systemsThe notion of intelligent machines has fascinated man for decades. It has been the subject of Hollywood movies, science fiction books and doomsday theories. Well, theyve arrived but not in the way you thought. I must stress that intelligent machines of the current generation do not have native intelligence as humans do. They are getting smarter on the back of their ability to process vast quantities of data really fast, and identify patterns and trends to be used. Who knows what the next generation of machines brings, though?A common example is the May I help you? assistants, which have appeared on e-commerce websites. Increasingly, you are not interacting with a human but a piece of software if you do ask a question. It has been programmed with learning algorithms, and fed masses of product catalogue and user behaviour data to be able to help you. Intelligent machines are also parsing through all the published legal cases and court decisions in recorded history to help lawyers serve their clients better; and doing exactly the same with doctors trying to figure out what might be wrong with a sick patient. IBMs Watson platform is perhaps the best known in this space, but its not the only one. Google has a different approach with the TensorFlow and Google Cloud Machine Learning combination. The analytics platforms from the likes of SAS are evolving too, as are new-age data storage systems from NetApp, HP Enterprise and their peers. The year 2017 will see consumer services firms in different sectors adopting cognitive technologies more aggressively. Expect the likes of banks, e-commerce companies, telecom service providers and hospitals to deploy them faster than others. From a wider perspective, the full story will unfold in 2018-19. Internet of Things (IoT)The Internet today has enabled interactions and engagement in society in ways which were not imagined even a decade ago. Video calling through the phone at practically zero marginal cost, cloud computing which allows organizations to think at global scale without the need for massive technology investments and a plethora of consumer services at your doorstep are just three manifestations of the amazing power of the Internet.The next wave is now upon us: machines are now interacting with each other and triggering processes without human intervention. In the process, mountains of data are being generated daily, enabling machine learning and cognitive computing. This is IoT. The 2016 IDC IoT survey in India, which covered 470 companies, reveals a great enthusiasm for IoT already. Process manufacturing companies as well as logistics services and trucking firms are leading the way. The Industrial Internet is born. The year 2017 is likely to see the inflection point of IoT adoption in India. Billions of sensors will help monitor oil pipelines remotely, control home air-conditioning systems and track trucks and pallets as they move through our vast countryside. Its potential is staggering, its promise mouth-watering. It can generate crores of rupees worth of efficiencies and productivity gains in the corporate sector; for consumers, it could mean being able to switch on your air conditioner before you reach home; or your coffee machine grinding the beans when the sensors in your bedroom note that youve up.  3D printingAt a recent conference, Anand Mahindra, chairman of the Mahindra Group, shared that they had put a 3D printer in a school as part of corporate social responsibility and R&D initiatives. The group was keen to see what innovation the children might come up with if they are given the right tools. The results are awaited but early signs are promising. The term 3D printing, in some ways, is a misnomer. They are actually capital goods equipment which operate visually like printers do. In the future, this technology is likely to radically remake manufacturing. Supply chains will be disrupted and the manufacturing process for many products will be democratized, with the possibility of garage-based production and retail store production already being realized. Nikes Fly Knit shoes are made in-shop after your foot is scanned and the images sent to the 3D printer. Skin grafts have been synthesized in labs; auto parts are being 3D printed. In 2017, we will see the gradual influx of these machines into manufacturing firms, research labs and the possible odd hospital. It will take some time and price cuts before 3D printers go mainstream. But it holds much promise and would be especially useful for far-flung areas of the nation. Natural user interfacesWhat I wouldnt give to not have to get up for the remote control, and simply change the channel on the television with a swipe of my hand, or through a conveniently placed gadget that would recognize my voice and change the channel! Thats Natural User Interface (NUI) for you and its here to stay. But really, while that TV remote is still important, a lot of what we experience is now being redefined by new forms of cognitive controls. The shift from text to graphics was a major leap, courtesy of Xerox Corpo ration, and popularised by Apple with their hallmark Macintosh OS in 1984. More recently, weve witnessed a revolution of sorts in the UI space: touch (smartphones), voice (Siri) and even gesture (Microsoft Kinect, Nintendo Wii).Today consumers want amplified, immersive and authentic experiences from what they consume; NUI enables just that. The human-machine interface is fast changing our experiences, thus heralding an era of multi-touch surfaces, powerful and lightweight mobile devices and now the emerging market of wearable technology. We are entering a fascinating world sans constraints physical and virtual.On the enterprise side, firms today are increasing the connect with their ecosystem of customers, employees, suppliers and partners, moving away from mere CX (customer experience) to authentic experiences. At IDC, were seeing this extensively in media and gaming; it is a matter of time before NUI permeates retail, healthcare, fashion and automobile verticals. It is my considered view that when the neural capabilities of touch, voice and gesture and the capable hardware thats available to process these inputs (at consumer prices to boot) are coupled with the large scale APIs to leverage these NUI opportunities, a new age of platforms which can redesign and revolutionize your experience will dawn. 2017 shall be a year when the increasing clamour for experience by consumers and the omni-experience transformation needs of enterprises shall see a scaling up of investments towards this aim. As this technology transformation evolves, so too will its impact on consumer experience and the digital business ecosystem.In sum, 2017 will see the next technological revolution reshaping Indian society, business and the government landscape. Recent events have already triggered the digitalization of the payments ecosystem at warp speed. The five technologies described above, individually and in combination, will herald the dawn of the next technological age.Jaideep Mehta is managing director, IDC India and South Asia.Five trends that can change the tech world by 2021Internet-of-things (IoT) software and solutions: IoT will be driving new levels of customer insight and engagement for some by 2021, but technology diversity and the need for organizational changes will still stymie or delay many firms. Intelligent agents: Intelligent agents and related robots will have eliminated a net 6% of jobs by 2021. Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR): By 2021, AR will be commonplace, while VR will remain niche. Artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive technology: Solutions powered by AI/cognitive technology will displace jobs with the biggest impact felt in transportation, logistics, customer service, and consumer services.Hybrid wireless: 5G will be rolling out by 2021, creating a high-bandwidth cellular backbone to support IoT devices.

-0.39,"Steve Hasker, global president and chief operating officer at Nielsen Holding plc, was in India to meet clients and speak on the growing importance of mobile in advertising at the Mobile Marketing Association conference in Gurgaon. 
				   
				During the trip, he met executives from PepsiCo, Nestle, Reckitt Benckiser, Tata group, BARC India and Facebook, among others.India is a very important market for us. The visit was to ensure our success continues and we stay connected with clients, Hasker said as he explained the importance of Nielsens newly launched Total Audience Measurement tool in the US. Edited excerpts:What does Total Audience Measurement include?Total Audience Measurement, thats been launched in the US, has the ability to measure any piece of video, audio or text, on any device at any time and to do it seamlessly and consistently. It has an advertising measurement component and a content measurement component and the ability to put them together. It obviously has a TV, PC, connected device and tablet, and smartphone component and in the US, we have rolled out all those pieces.Here in India, we have started with the digital ad ratings. So, we started with the advertising component. In the coming months, we look to launch the content ratings. But Total Audience Measurement is more than just digital?What Total Audience Measurement does is, it takes all the digital touch points and combines with TV advertising. So, for any campaign, an agency will say, okay, I should think about TV relative to these digital touch points. Should I buy more TV or less TV? This is very important because different markets have different objectives in terms of reach and frequency. Right now, Total Audience Measurement is available in the US; but we have also launched in Mexico and a version of it in Brazil.When will you introduce it in India?To a large extent, that is dependent on BARC (Broadcast Audience Research Council). They have the TV data. In theory, we could do it today because BARC data and digital ad ratings are consistent; but it requires an advertiser to put those two together.Is linear TV declining?What we have seen in a number of countries is the pressure on TV ratings. The size and frequency of audiences watching television has come under pressure in some of the more developed markets like the US, UK and Australia. And that has meant growth in terms of time spent on digital devices. However, what marketers are trying and have now started to understand is that TV has a reasonably unique value proposition in terms of the ability to tell a story to consumers in a way that is accepted by them. And that many large brand campaigns need a TV component. So, the ability to come out of TV altogether and going to digital was overstated. Particularly in 2016 in many markets, we have seen a reversion back to TV and more reliance on TV from an advertising perspective. But the UK and US numbers suggest digital ad revenue has surpassed TV numbers.In the UK, digital surpassed TV a number of years ago; and in the US, it has surpassed in the past 18 months. Those numbers are for real. But this year, in what we call the upfronts which is the mechanism of buying and selling advertising on TV in US, we have seen some reversion back to TV. What a number of major advertisers found that they probably swung the pendulum too far toward digital; and in doing so, they saw some decrease in reach of their campaigns to their target audience. Was losing Indias TV market to BARC a big setback for Nielsen?We certainly enjoyed being part of the TAM joint venture (between Nielsen and Kantar Media owned by WPP Plc) for quite a long period of time. We are very supportive of BARC. We met BARC and have a good relationship. Wed like to help them if we can. So we are looking forward. We think therell be an opportunity to do that. Which are the successful digital models globally? What we have seen in the last couple of years in the US and many countries is the emergence of truly spectacular digital models. One of course is Google with its search model thats been extended to YouTube. And the second is Facebook. In fact, Google, Facebook and, increasingly, Snapchat are proving to be very successful digital models partly because they have attracted disproportionate amounts of consumer time and attention and partly because they have an economic model which is very efficient. Facebook announced last week it had 4 million advertisers. And one of the great things about Facebook and Google platforms is that for an advertiser, they are extremely easy to use. You can target a particular audience and you can buy using your credit card So for advertisers and agencies, it is a great model. It is also a highly profitable model.What about newspaper publishers?It is more difficult for traditional publishersnewspapers or magazines or what we call pure play digital content websites and portals because the audiences access their content through Google, Facebook and Snapchat. In other words, the means in which they get content is through one of these larger players and, secondly, the time and attention is smaller on their properties.So, whats their future?In an increasingly fragmented and complicated world, great journalism, great video production, great TV production is not easier to do. So, even though we have got this great democratization of information and it is freely available in many different places, the ability to interpret news and write insightful commentary around the news, does not become easier in that environment. So, the value attached to that goes up not down.Whats happened here is that theres been a significant disruption in the distribution mechanism; so, whether it is a newspaper or a TV channel , or magazine, consumers now have many different ways to get to that content but, ultimately, the content itself has to be incredibly valuable. And now, done properly, there are more ways to monetize great journalism than there were previously. Right now, what media formats is venture capital (VC) chasing?VCs are very good at sniffing out areas of growth. So they are focused on a couple of thingsone is video. That is, players who are in the digital video space, either producing or distributing video content. Secondly, they are focused on players who have interesting data setson consumer identity or consumer behaviourpurchase behaviour or media consumption behaviour. The other place VCs are more focused on is fintechlike mobile payments and also on healthcare related apps and start-ups.Nielsen acquired Indicus Analytics in India. Are you eyeing more firms here?We would like to make more, provided they enhance our business and make sense financially. For us, India is a very important market. What is the next big thing for Nielsen?The big area of focus for us will be the connected system. We have two businesses. One measures media behaviour, the other measures consumption of consumer packaged goods and provides all kinds of analytics around that. In the media business, the big investment is Total Audience Measurement, and, as we said, we have rolled that out in many countries and we are in the process of bringing that to India. The second area is to build the connected system which links the market share data to explanatory analytics. Say, for instance, did the market share of Kinley water go up because of better product innovation like a new bottle size, different packaging or concept, or did it go up because its marketing has been more effectivetheres been more money on digital and more money on TV. Or did it go up because of in-store execution, its pricing, promotion and assortment was better. So, the connected system will, in real time, enable the brand manager of a particular brand to understand how am I doingwhat happened, why did it happen and what should I do next.So, were in the process of prototyping this with a number of clients across the world and we would look to introduce this here in India sometime next year. We are piloting it with six clients at the moment in different parts of the world. This is our biggest area of investment for the next five years.",2016-10-17,bNj32jkOPJkyiWyZYj8wxO,"India is a very important market for Nielsen, says global president and chief operating officer Steve Hasker",competitor,01:41,Some digital advertising is moving back to TV: Nielsens Steve Hasker
-0.25,"Reliance Industries Ltds (RILs) March quarter results were better than estimates, but only just. Its stand-alone Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) last quarter stood at Rs.10,727 crore, or about 3% higher than consensus estimates. According to a Bloomberg poll of analysts, Ebitda was estimated at Rs.10,394 crore.
				   
				In fact, some brokerage firms such as Kotak Institutional Equities had estimated Ebitda of over Rs.10,700 crore, on the back of strong margins in the petrochemicals segment. As it turns out, margins in the petrochemicals business were strong at 14%, far higher than 10.6% for the March quarter last year. Petrochemicals Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margins were higher due to strong product deltas (rate of change in prices compared with the change in unit costs) and low absolute product prices. Petrochemicals Ebit increased 29% due to strength in polymer deltas, robust polymer demand and higher volumes in the polyester chain.Besides, RILs gross refining margin (GRM) at $10.8 a barrel was marginally higher than many analysts estimates. For instance, Morgan Stanley Research and BNP Paribas Securities (Asia) Ltd were expecting GRM of $10.6 per barrel and $10.5 a barrel, respectively. While the companys GRM has declined on a sequential basis, this was expected, considering that benchmark Singapore GRM had also declined compared with the December quarter. Whats more, the company has managed to maintain its premium over Singapore GRMs at $3.5 a barrel, as in the December quarter. Strong gasoline and naphtha cracks, robust demand growth and favourable crude markets helped boost refining margins, the company said. Higher utilization rates also helped.On a consolidated basis, while RILs organized retail business has seen a smart 26% year-on-year Ebit growth, this was offset by a sharp drop in the oil and gas segment Ebit (97% year-on-year decline). The stand-alone oil and gas business reported losses at the Ebit level due to lower realization for liquids and a decline in production, while a drop in prices affected the companys US shale operations.As pointed out earlier, the results were largely on expected lines and dont do much to move the needle as far as the stocks valuations go. Currently, one RIL share trades at 11 times its estimated earnings for this fiscal year. In the near-term though, the fact that refining margin has declined may cloud sentiments for the stock. So far, quarter-to-date, Singapore GRM has averaged at $5.2 a barrel, according to an analyst, compared with $7.7 in the March quarter. Of course, it would help if petrochemical margins remain steady.However, over the medium term, the outlook for the stock may turn positive as investors start looking at higher earnings on account of RILs expansion plans. As Amit Shah of BNP Paribas writes in a recent report, the benefit of expansion of petchem capacities, pet-coke and refinery off-gas cracker projects would be visible from FY18 onwards.But on the other hand, the prospects of the telecom business remain an uncertainty. BNP, for instance, has not assigned any value to RILs telecom business in its sum-of-parts valuation. Undoubtedly, analysts and investors will keep a close watch on Reliance Jios launch and pricing strategy.The writer does not have positions in the companies discussed here.",2016-04-23,bUc8KvnZEHZiYT4PcJq4BL,"Results were largely on expected lines and didnt do much to affect the RIL stocks valuations

				ONGC has been pursuing exploration in the basin and had last March announced a $5 billion (Rs34,000 crore) investment over the next three years in two of its fields there after the central government earlier that month announced a liberal pricing formula for natural gas from deep sea blocks. The investment figure announced on Saturday is for the entire basin. The agreement with Andhra Pradesh to take forward all critical exploration and production activities in the state was signed on the sidelines of the Partnership Summit, 2017 jointly organized by the state government and industry chamber Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in Visakhapatnam on Friday.ONGC sees Andhra Pradesh as a hydrocarbon rich state. ONGC is very aggressively pursuing to put the huge gas reserves it has discovered in KG basin, to production. It plans to invest about Rs10,000 crore for exploration and production activities in onland blocks and about Rs68,000 crore in offshore assets in the KG Basin, said a company statement. As per the deal, the state government will assist ONGC in taking over land and in obtaining other statutory clearances.

-0.81,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. reported revenues of $3.19 billion for the September quarter, marginally higher than the Streets estimate of $3.16 billion. On a sequential basis, revenues grew by 3.3%, which again doesnt look impressive for the traditionally strong September quarter. After the June quarters impressive 6% sequential growth, investors are evidently feeling let down.
				   
				But these quibbles aside, Cognizants results reiterate the fact that the company has been miles ahead of the competition this year. On a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, its revenues grew by 16.5%, after adjusting for incremental revenues from the TriZetto Corp. acquisition. In comparison, industry leader Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) grew revenues by just 5.8% y-o-y. Infosys Ltd grew revenues by 7.6% and Wipro Ltds growth stood at just 3.4%.Just a year ago, TCSs growth was higher by about 300 basis points, when it was growing at a healthy pace of almost 15%. But while its growth has slipped sharply in the past four quarters, Cognizant has done just the opposite. The latters growth rate is now almost 11 percentage points higher, an unusually high differential in an industry that is so competitive. One basis point is 0.01%.Also note that Cognizant has raised its revenue growth guidance for 2015 each quarter, for the past three quarters, while analysts have been cutting growth estimates for most Indian tech leaders. Cognizant has benefited from not having any material exposure to troubled sectors such as energy and telecom. But thats not the only reason for its outperformance. There has also been a shift in the nature of IT spending in the past year, and Cognizant, with its higher exposure to discretionary services such as consulting (58% of revenues last quarter), has gained. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a recent note to clients, Companies with inherent strength in run-the-business services are struggling to sustain momentum, while those with greater exposure to discretionary spending are gaining. Last quarter, the so-called run-the-business part of Cognizants portfolio grew by 1.5% sequentially, while growth in segments that depend on discretionary spending stood three times higher at 4.6%.As pointed out earlier in this column, Cognizant appears to have made disproportionate gains in the trend towards increasing spend on digital services. According to analysts, the companys early investments in this segment, including acquisitions it has made in the space, coupled with its consulting expertise, has helped it gain a higher share of this relatively new revenue stream.Its not that others havent had any success. TCS said after its September quarter results that revenues from digital services grew by 10% sequentially last quarter. Be that as it may, overall revenue growth numbers suggest that Cognizant has gained considerable market share this year, at the expense of large India-based IT companies. Last quarter, its incremental revenues of $426 million (on a y-o-y basis) were nearly double that of TCSs ($227 million), and higher than the cumulative incremental revenues of TCS and Infosys.This clear divergence is also reflected in the way these stocks have moved in the past yearCognizants shares have risen by over 35%, while those of TCS have fallen by 3%.",2015-11-04,beBSWzL5LdrIGeZM5tmu3H,"Cognizants results reiterate the fact that the company has been miles ahead of competition this year

				The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) took action against 422 pilots and crew members, up from 275 in 2015. The action included suspension, off-rostering and warnings for violating air safety norms.Jet Airways had the highest number of crew to be pulled up in 2016, followed by SpiceJet. At least 116 pilots and crew at Jet Airways and its subsidiary JetLite faced action. SpiceJet had 101 crew members who were pulled up by the regulator.Sixty-six violations were detected at Air India, 55 at IndiGo, 16 at GoAir, six at Vistara and other smaller airlines.

0.24,"The August sales numbers of leading commercial vehicle manufacturers are worrisome.Not only does it weigh down on investor sentiment towards this segmentwhich was the first to turn around in the auto sectorit also raises questions on the strength of the economic recovery.Market leader Tata Motors Ltd reported a shocking 17% year-on-year drop in the domestic sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles (M&HCVs) during August. It was also lower, compared with sales in July.Ashok Leyland Ltd, the second largest truck and bus maker, reported a 7.9% drop in sales in overall M&HCV sales, too.This is not sudden.Tata Motors sales hit a roadblock in May. It has not recovered since. Sales of Ashok Leyland have been sliding, too. One could argue that the segment clocked heady growth for nearly two years before falling and, hence, the high base has challenged growth prospects.If M&HCV and auto sales reflect the state of economy, then it questions the sustainability of green shoots of economic recovery, too.Further, although manufacturing in select sectors that back consumption has picked up, it has not enthused investment demand and capital expenditure.Further, heavy industries such as construction and mining are still limping.India Ratings adds that the robust growth in M&HCV sales in FY15 and FY16 was perhaps pent-up demand.Meanwhile, truck rentals have also fallen in the past few months.One could blame this on the cut in diesel prices in the recent past and a heavy monsoon that may have disrupted the movement of goods.However, a note by Reliance Securities on the sales numbers for August says that replacement demand, which was robust a few quarters ago after the long lull in truck sales, has tapered off. Meanwhile, the inadequate rise in freight rates and a slow pick-up in construction activity, along with a high FY16 base, has kept truck sales subdued. Growth in light commercial vehicle sales, though rising, has also moderated.Fleet operators appear to have another concern, too. The new goods and services tax (GST), when introduced, will no doubt reduce logistics hurdles and reduce time at check posts, thereby improving fleet productivity, too.So, perhaps operators may not feel the need to expand until GST comes into existence.A Tata Motors presentation highlighting its June quarter performance says growth in the freight rate index shows a decelerating trend since the December quarter of FY15 on the back of weak economic activity.This may weigh down on truck sales, unless there is a post-monsoon revival in economic activity.For now, one hopes that it is a seasonal blip.All eyes are, therefore, on the second half of FY17, which should set the pace of growth for commercial vehicles.",2016-09-04,buuWX52Vy2iLRf58Gq3n1M,Not only does the decline weigh down on investor sentiment towards this segmentwhich was the first to turn around in the auto sectorit also raises questions on the strength of the economic recovery,competitor,20:18,Drop in truck sales a reason for worry
0.25,"At a regulators round table at the Mint Annual Banking Conclave held in Mumbai on 23 January,  former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor D. Subbarao and former Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chairman C.B. Bhave talk about the impact of demonetisation, the move towards a cashless economy and the autonomy of RBI in a session moderated by Mints consulting editor Tamal Bandyopadhyay. Edited excerpts: 
After demonetisation, everybody is talking about growth slowing down. The latest one was the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which said 100 basis point growth will be compromised this year, another 150 basis points next year. India will lose the tag of the fastest-growing economy in the world. In fact, Moodys said India will continue to remain the fastest-growing economy. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) estimates say that demonetisation impact will be 50 basis points. Can you please tell me how short will be the short-term pain and how long will it take the long-term gain, and what kind of gain do you see? Subbarao: On the growth numbers itself, I must admit I have not crunched the numbers but I have seen fair estimates, from Dr Manmohan Singh in Parliament saying loss of GDP (gross domestic product) will be 2 percentage points, to RBI saying that it will be 5% but the consensus seems to be above 1 percentage point of GDP. What is quite clear though, on which there is lot of agreement, is even though we might lose some GDP in one year, recovery will be quite V shaped as we are already seeing that V-shaped recovery, there will be no hysteresis in the sense that once economy is remonetised we will get that trend, loss if any will be one-third loss. Of course, that will be a huge loss. Apart from the loss to GDP, hundreds of million less privileged in the country had endured pain and hardship, and also economic loss. Cost of demonetisation has been direct in the short term, the benefits are uncertain and unquantifiable. The question is: Will the net cost-benefit calculus be positive. The hope is that it will be positive provided two things happen. The way I look at two methods I use for assessing the success of demonetisation. The first is to what extent this process destroyed or detected (black money). Second, to what extent is regeneration of black money prevented by demonetisation as everyone has said tax black money, act on time, it does nothing to prevent allegations, it puts a fear like Chinese say they killed a chicken to scare the monkey. So if there is fear in people creating black money that they are going to get penalized, benefits will be quite substantial. So you are saying that demonetisation should not be the end of it, there should be a series of it?Subbarao: Absolutely. You know already in reports about people generating (black) money, all the people who come down the system and are detected to have black money. There should be a trail on them. There should be other mechanisms. GST (goods and services tax) itself might be a big instrument in spotting black money. There should be other audit trails, investigating agency, tax agency. They must use technology. Most of all, the government must create a fear in people that if they indulge in black money creation. If some people are caught in this operation, it would be great. How do you see the economy in the next few quarters? In a democracy, we actually need to create fear to implement thingsis this the right way to do something?Bhave: Firstly, I am not an economist. From what I read of estimates that have come out, nobody has a clue. People are still gauging what the impact will be. As third-quarter results of listed companies come out, we will get some indication. There is about one month and eight days of a quarter, which is normal. Sectors likely to be affected will be cash dependent. Initially, unlisted portion of the economy, informal sectors will be affected more. I neither believe in extreme forecast of 3%, also some people who are saying its marginal impact, I think we are going to land somewhere in between. If you say by 31 March that quarters results will reveal the impact, isnt that too early?Bhave: (With) March results, which will come out in April, you will know two things. One, the full impact of demonetisation disturbance on companies and the way the economy is recovering because we need to know both these things (to know) what kind of debate it is going to have. Lot of people are hoping that the recovery will be V-shaped and you will see the recovery coming up as fast as the downturn came in. I dont know.Do you have anything to say to what Dr Subbarao said about a series of measures as a follow-up and you need to create fear among people, black money hoarders. Is this the way forward? Do you agree with that?Bhave: I agree with Dr Subbarao completely that we need to address the flow problem as well. My take on the issue of corruption is that this is probably the most important issue which we tend to ignore. Secondly that in our conversation we discuss it as something outside of the room, not realizing all of us in the room are responsible directly or indirectly for generation of unaccounted money. This has infested our body politics, our social body to such an extent (where) we are in such a state (that) you have a patient with (his) body entirely infected... lets say, these are the two conditions. You should not operate on so small a part that as soon as you finish the operation, rest of the body gets infected again; you should not operate on such a large body part, that patient himself will be dead. As if these two conditions were not enough, the knife I am giving you has also poison on it, the machine through which you have to implement is also an issue and, therefore, we are only going to find a long-term answer to it. I agree with Dr Subbarao that we need to initiate the step, but dont expect quick results from it.If you remember Prime Ministers 8 November address to the nation, demonetisation was about fighting terror financing, fighting counterfeit notes, terrorism. There was no reference to a cashless economy. There was speculation how much money we will get.  Then we see the lottery is used to promote the drive to cashless.Subbarao: If the objective is only to move the economy to cashless, evidently I believe that the motivation of demonetisation was to assault black money. I was also surprised like Tamal that the government in last two-and-a-half months has talked about different objectives at different times and were somewhat muffled in their communication. I would have been quite happy if they said the intent of demonetisation is to attack black money and there are other incidental benefits of demonetisation such as the transition to a cashless economy to an extent which are consistent with our other objectives.In your book you spoke about how Denmark and Sweden are becoming cashless economies. As a former regulator, what is the right way to go towards a cashless economy? Subbarao: Well it is not that I have done extensive calculation on a cashless economy. I must take some pride that I talked about cashless economy before it became such a popular phrase or slogan in our country. I was talking about a cashless economy, of course the benefits of which come out of it including, creating an audit trail. I was talking more in the context of negative interest rate. You go back one year, January/February last year, the big thing around global economy was how negative interest rate is going to work . It will work if you go towards a cashless economy. It was in that context I was motivated to write about economy. I think it is still possible to go towards a cashless economy and pursue the objective of financial inclusion.From economics to logistics, you spoke about the economics part of it. I would like you to tell us about the logistics part. Being chairman of NSDL (National Securities Depository Ltd), you are somehow the architect of dematerialized shares in India. That was a humongous task at that point of time, physical shares transition to demat, scale was much smaller but there may be some similarities. Are there lessons to be learnt from your demat exercise in terms of sequence?Bhave: Its an interesting question. As you rightly said that we cant really compare the two. When we went in for the demat process, we had about 20 million customers. Today, even if you take the adult population as 500-550 million people, there is that difference. The other important difference is that, in the entire implementation of the demat process ... it was between the regulator and the actors in the demat process like stock exchanges and NSDL, etc. who arrived at most of the decisions. The impact it makes is that when you dont have the sovereign, you cant compel people to do something. You need to do things in the provision of the law. The Demat law said the investor had a choice in either physical or demat form. We had to stay clear of this. Sebi doesnt get as much credit for this work but under (D.R.) Mehtas chairmanship Sebi adopted an absolutely collegial approach to this. We never got the feeling that we were not heard. Third important point is that at such times, the incentive for an actual player is to push for more and more. But in practical terms, considering the size of the country reach it is wiser to go step by step. NSDL played that role, said no many times to higher dematerialization because we advised, we will learn from the mistakes. The last point we made sure small investors were not affected by it. Any shareholder can sell shares up to 500 in physical form. The Regulator always kept its window open. What you do is 80:20 rule, you are pushing 20% but covering 80% of the market. If I paraphrase you, the sovereign should not have much role in the entire exercise. We need to leave it to executives, you need to go through a consulting process, you need to sequence it properly and in certain segments give them enough time.Bhave: Only the first part. I didnt say that the sovereign should not be a part of it. But I said if the sovereign is part of it, you run across the temptation to compelwhere he is not part of the thing that table will be conscious in progressing.Everybody talks about RBI autonomy, what about Sebis autonomy? In 2010 you tested that. There was a fight between the insurance regulator and Sebi, and you lost it. Was that the reason you didnt get a second term. In my interview, you said chairmen come and chairmen go. How independent is this institution and what is your take on that?Bhave: Ultimately any regulatory institution is a creature of law. So it needs to work within parameters of this law. Every single regulatory law in the country has a provision which says the government can issue directive to this regulator to do something. I am just saying autonomy in a sense is circumscribed by this fact that there is an overlapping provision. In practical terms in my mind autonomy comes from how the leadership of the regulator is removable. The Constitution makers wanted the Election Commission, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India to be independent offices, the Supreme Court judges, they made provision that these people can be removed by two-thirds majority of Parliament before their tenure ends.Are you saying its not the institution but the leader that matters? At the end of the day, the buck stops at the leader. The same institution can have less or more autonomy. Whats the wrestling power of the leader?Bhave: The leader matters certainly, you build institutions with the people. You need people who have that assurance and who know they are not subject to arbitrary removal. They have financial autonomy. In practical terms, autonomy is also determined by what kind of personality people are dealing with issues. People who are sensitive to institutional importance would deal with the same issue in a different way. Subbarao: I cant just give a binary answer. I think the perception is much more than the reality. And that perception arises from the fact that there is a section of the law under which the government can issue any instruction to RBI that it considers in public interest, but after consultation with the governor. In the last 80 years of RBI history, Section 7 has been quiet inconsequential. That section has never been invoked. The government has never given any instruction invoking Section 7. The belief that RBI is not autonomous because some section is in law, is completely misread. Sometimes there is pressure on RBI to do things that it is not comfortable in doing. I believe RBI is and should be autonomous in close domains of RBI mandates. Monetary policy, regulation of financial institutions, payment systems on those issues categorically mandate RBI is autonomous and should not bend to the pressure. Over the last eight years from Sir Benegal Rama Rau to Dr Raghuram Rajan, RBI has maintained the tradition of enforcing autonomy.You have agreed that its this perception that RBI ends up compromising Subbarao: There is misinformed perception that RBI doesnt enjoy autonomy and that perception gets strengthened because of repetition. There is responsibility both on part of the government and RBI to manage and improve this perception. Doing what it believes is in the best public interest no matter what the government believes should be done.That is number one. First of all, I think body language used should be very mesh. Second, public criticism of Reserve Bank is powerful of course. RBI is a policy institution, it makes policy that affects the lives of millions of people. But there is one exception. The government should not criticize the RBI governor because that is detrimental to macroeconomic management. If the markets believe that there are differences between the government and RBI, that is not constructive but destructive. The government, if it has any concerns about RBI policy management, that should be internally managed.You said that in the history of RBI, 80 years now and Sebi, 25-plus years, section 7 was never used. I will ask now a counter question. Why do I need to use section 7? If I advise and you listen to me, in a short notice it is actually a threat.Subbarao: I think it is exaggerated. On what basis you say RBI autonomy has been touched upon in question of demonetisation. RBI board has taken half an hour, I dont know exactly. There is no experience. This was a decision that was taken on judgement. There were people on RBI board. I want to ask a counter question. How long does the Union cabinet take to approve the Union budget? 15 minutes. How long does a state cabinet take to approve state budget? 10 minutes. I can tell you because I was finance secretary of state and finance secretary to state governor.I believe that the RBI board must respect that they have taken a considered decision. The governor himself has said that they were in consultation with the government for the past several months. Its like the army preparing for battle and the decision to attack takes place in a very short period of time. That is exactly what has happened, I am not an insider anymore. I believe they have been preparing for long time.",2017-01-30,cEDJ5YKqm297EuY9w9ZsxM,"Former RBI governor D. Subbarao, former Sebi chairman C.B.

				What next for Apples productivity push?Having mended bridges with the likes of International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and Microsoft, and forged partnerships with the likes of Cisco and Deloitte, Apple is in the midst of making its most aggressive push into the enterprise ecosystem. These partnerships take care of the software side of things, but the conundrum remains with the hardware. There is a definite potential of cannibalization within the computing device line-up, with the MacBook Airs, iPad Pros and MacBook Pros fighting for a common demographic, for the most part. Apple will also have to contend with some amount of criticism in 2017, with the underwhelming upgrades to the MacBook Pro line-upthis at a time when Microsoft flexed its muscles with the Surface Studio. Nevertheless, the iPhone remains as solid as ever for enterprise users.Microsofts Surface gambit: Revive the PC market?At a time when personal computer, or PC, shipments have been steadily declining, Microsoft seems to have taken it upon itself to set the benchmark in the ecosystem. And in the process, also show off what it is capable of. The Surface Studio all-in-one (AIO) with the Pixel Dial joins the Surface Pro and Surface Book portable Windows convertibles, and is indeed revolutionary. The 28-inch PixelSense display is believed to be the slimmest of its kind, and has 63% more pixels than a 4K TV. With prices starting $2,999 (Rs2,00,000 approximately), it isnt going to fly off the shelves. Though arguably, the first time ever, Microsoft has started to beat Apple at the innovation and design games, but just how they follow it up in 2017 will matter a lot. Flexing of the muscles aside, the real utility will now need to stand outand that holds true for the entire laptop and convertible market.Big data: Itll be biggerWhile there is considerable focus on smart cities, public transport and smarter infrastructure, there remains an ever-increasing need for data to make these systems work. For example, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Ford Motor Co. are collecting the cellphone location data of as many as two million Boston city residents; the idea is to create near-instant urban mobility patterns which would otherwise have taken years to collect, decipher and work on. Big data will be ever so critical for corporations, governments and also for research, and this is what will drive productivity, innovation and collaboration.Googles Pixel hardware game: A new inningsWith the Pixel phones, there has been a constant emphasis on the Made by Google aspect. It is clear that the software and services major wants to get into the hardware game, on its own terms. And so it has, wielding greater control over the successors to the Nexus smartphones. Finally, Android as a platform is shining throughunhindered, unwrapped and uncluttered. Pixel has shown just how good Android can be, but Google needs to fix bigger problemsthe world is still buying Android phones made by the likes of Samsung, Motorola and a whole bunch of Chinese brands, and they have no control over thatcustomization, lack of software updates and more. Do we see an even bigger Pixel smartphone line-up, covering more affordable price points?Security: Artificial Intelligence (AI) to prevent cyber-attacks?In todays world, cybersecurity is managed by a combination of humans and machines, with the latter usually configured by the former, and there remains genuine room for error. This is where the researchers from the MIT, perhaps, have a solution for the futurea new system called AI2. It uses machine learning to flag potential security threats and attacks. The human element remains, but the new system can actually scan and flag a lot more data than any human can.Dells ultimate ultrabook becomes flexibleThe Dell XPS 13 is perhaps the best ultrabook in the Windows laptop ecosystem.

-0.04,"In a past column, I touched upon what has come to be known as the digital divide between the haves and the have-nots and suggested that it may be time for a supra-national body similar to the World Health Organization to be constituted to help govern the world of technology. My argument is that, to some degree at least, technology is a public good, just as basic health is, and its benefits need to be shared across a larger swathe of the worlds population.In a scathing article in the Financial Times last week, Chandran Nair, founder of the Global Institute for Tomorrow, argues that the technology giants of today such as Microsoft completely ignore the fact that the majority of the worlds populationespecially those in developing countriesare still stuck in a pre-industrial age, and that technology as the developed world knows itsearch engines, e-commerce, artificial intelligence, virtual reality and so onare of no use to people who have to still practise pre-industrial techniques such as slash-and-burn farming in order to survive. I must have been reading his thoughts.He talks of the yearly haze that blankets countries such as Singapore and Malaysia when farmers in Indonesia burn their oil palm crop every year so that they can plant anewwhile developers and IT executives sit in air-conditioned rooms and hold conferences about the future of technology, blissfully unaware of pre-industrial age social problems, such as where to find a toilet. He claims that when a question about this deep digital divide was posed to Microsoft, the spokespersons answer was: This is a question for a futurist to ponder, and not one for technologists to worry about.The lopsided distribution of technology benefits is a known fact, but regulators are flummoxed with how to deal with the problem. Regulationor governmental activismto date has been focused only on three vectors. First, the attempt to break monopolistic market power held by a few corporations. Second, an attempt to mop up a larger share of the tax pie when such companies experience enormous profits. And, third, a clumsy attempt to protect privacy by forcing data on customers to stay in the country where it was first generated.At the beginning of this century, Microsoft was hit by US regulators who found that its Internet Explorer, which was bundled with Windows software, was an attempt to shut out other Internet browsers, and forced to pay a hefty fine for indulging in monopolistic practices. The European Union (EU) is now trying to force search engines to not use their market power to coerce content providers such as news organizations to provide their information for free on their search engine sites. YouTube has been banned in China, and Google simply shut down operations in Spain when the Spaniards tried to charge a levy on Google aggregating content from news organizations and then providing this news for free for users of its search engine or mobile operating systems.Tax legislation, sometimes even grand-fathered to defeat judgements handed down by an apex courtas happened in the famed Vodafone India tax caseis an example of a national government going to great lengths to use policy to widen its tax net, or the second vector.We now have WhatsApp using a change in its privacy policy to hand over its users information to Facebook, its parent, after first claiming that no one, not even WhatsApp, can see the content of the messages that its users send to one another. WhatsApp, of course, claims that this data is only going to be used for it to explore ways in which its users can interact with businesses that matter to them without being subjected to third-party banner ads and spam. Well, okay, but Daddy Facebook is even rumoured to have algorithms that can predict when two of its users are falling in love with one another.Most outsourcers in India are hampered by ham-handed EU privacy laws which mandate that personal data regarding European citizens needs to stay in Europe. Streamlined, supra-national legislation in this areagoverning the capture and use of personal data, and the nature of the myriad personal relationships that individuals have with one another onlinewill be necessary soon. The present clumsy laws need to change.Regulation has not yet addressed the fourth vectorthe use of technology for the common good. In one of my recent discussions with Kashyap Kompella, a researcher at The Real Story Group, he spoke of the need for an Indian Technology Service to be included among Indias civil service agencies. This, he argued, could support the formation of unified policies for bringing technological benefits to the poor, as well as making sure that data privacy issues are managed with no negative impact on the citizenry.My take is that while such national, governmental bodies are necessary so that each country can form its own technology policies, there are certain aspects of the rapid advance of technology that can only be governed and managed through supra-national bodies that ensure a modicum of egalitarian distribution of the positive aspects of technology (i.e. technologys characteristics as a public good) and the negative aspects (data piracy, identity theft and other such public dangers posed by cyber criminals) are policed and kept to a minimum. In all seriousness, I would vote that China be the first president of this body.Siddharth Pai is a management and technology consultant.",2016-08-30,cMteXq54s65H6QzfVvn49N,"The lopsided distribution of technology benefits is a known fact, but regulators are flummoxed with how to deal with the problem

Overall revenue increased by about 14% to Rs.1,532 crore. Still, a decline in advertising and publicity expenses, and other expenses boosted operating profit performance.Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) increased as much as 53% year-on-year to Rs.414 crore.  Kotak Institutional Equities and Edelweiss Securities were expecting an Ebitda of Rs.372.7 crore and Rs.366.8 crore, respectively. Nevertheless, a higher tax outgo and rising depreciation costs together with a decline in other income meant net profit growth was much slower at 13% to Rs.260 crore.What next? What will really be worth watching is whether ad revenue growth performance is sustainable in fiscal year 2017. That should influence the stock, which has outperformed the benchmark Sensex in the past one year. Zee Entertainment expects industry advertising revenue to grow by 15-16% this year, a rate similar to last year. While it is true that the likes of Patanjali are adding to advertising momentum from FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) sector, some others in the FMCG space have slowed down; so, we expect stable performance from FMCG sector this year, says Modi. Also, its worth noting that advertising momentum from e-commerce firms is likely to soften, which would be compensated by better performance from auto and telecom sectors, he adds.Nevertheless, valuations seem to be capturing much of the optimism.

-0.1,"New York: Anshu Jain, the former Deutsche Bank AG co-chief executive officer (CEO), is joining Cantor Fitzgerald LP as president, restarting his career at a much smaller firm after leaving Germanys largest bank amid mounting legal and regulatory problems.
				   
				Jain, 53, will help the closely held company expand in areas including fixed-income and equities trading as well as prime brokerage, Cantor Chairman and CEO Howard W. Lutnick said Monday in a phone interview. The firm is looking to capitalize as stiff regulations force global investment banks, including many in Europe, to pare businesses and pull back from some clients.The ability for us to do business with those accounts is a great opportunity, Lutnick said. We have a great fixed-income business in America, but well expand the number of products in which well do business with our clients. In Europe, well grow our investment banking business, taking Cantor Fitzgerald into the next level. And the firm aims to grow in Asia, he said.Jain helped build Deutsche Bank into Europes biggest securities firm over two decades before stepping down in June 2015 as profitability suffered amid a trading slump, stiffer regulation and years of government probes. His successor, John Cryan, has since scrapped bonus awards for top management, suspended dividend payments, pledged to eliminate thousands of jobs and cut risk-weighted assets at the securities unit to restore investor confidence.Becoming friendsJain said in February he would advise online lender Social Finance Inc., following former Wall Street leaders John Mack and Vikram Pandit in focusing on Silicon Valley ventures looking to disrupt traditional banks. Now, hes jumping to a scrappy Wall Street underdog that survived against long odds after the 11 September, 2001, terrorist attacks killed 658 of its employees  more than two-thirds of its New York-based workforce.Lutnick, 55, rebuilt the firm over more than a decade, sometimes hiring in areas that fell out of favor at bigger investment banks after the 2008 financial crisis. Its core Wall Street business employs about 1,600 people and runs trading desks in financial centers around the globe, according to its website, while the broader companyincluding a variety of financial services and real estate operationsemploys more than 10,000 globally.I have long admired Howards extraordinary leadership and successful efforts as he and his team rebuilt and expanded, Jain said in a statement. As a leading non-bank financial institution, with cutting-edge technology and a global reach, Cantor is well-positioned to capitalize on the changing financial landscape.Lutnick said he became friends with Jain over the past five years and that by late last summer they began talking about the possibility of Jain signing on. He will assume his new post in the coming weeks and work from London, according to a company spokeswoman. Lutnick held the president title in the 1990s.Building capitalThe firm intends to increase the capital it uses to handle client business, according to the statement. It hasnt yet finalized plans for raising the additional funds, Lutnick said. Enlisting Jain shouldnt be seen as an attempt to build something in Deutsche Banks image, he said.This is Anshu doing something different, Lutnick said. Hes already run Deutsche Bank. Hes not trying to recreate that. Hes trying to do something different, and something with a different client focus.Shawn Matthews will remain head of Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., the broker-dealer unit. In the past year hes hired leaders for its debt capital markets business, and he brought on Jefferies Group trader Rohit Bansal to lead a distressed-debt trading group, adding to its leveraged-finance team. The firm added veteran salesmen from Deutsche Bank and Barclays Plc in November to bulk up its fixed-income team in New York.Cantor has also been hiring talent abroad in recent years, adding executives in London. And Lutnick has been seeking to expand subsidiaries including BGC Partners Inc., which in 2015 won an agreement to buy interdealer broker GFI Group Inc. to help handle large trades between banks.Jains riseJain joined Deutsche Bank in 1995 and rose to lead a corporate and investment banking division that produced most of the companys revenue. In 2012, he became co-CEO succeeding Josef Ackermann, who had held the top spot for a decade. A cascade of bad news followed as Jain and co-CEO Juergen Fitschen worked to shore up the banks capital, cut costs and boost returns. The lender was probed for tax evasion in carbon markets, raided by the police and ordered to pay $2.5 billion for its role in rigging benchmark interest rates known as Libor.Within weeks of the Libor settlement, Jain emerged from the annual shareholder meeting with the lowest backing for management by investors in more than a decade. After he stepped down as co-CEO, an executive shakeup followed that saw the exit of other board members and investment-bank leaders.Last month, Deutsche Bank agreed to a $7.2 billion settlement to end a US investigation into its sales of the mortgage securities that helped fuel the 2008 financial crisis. Germanys biggest bank still faces probes into whether it manipulated foreign-currency rates and precious metals prices and whether it facilitated transactions that helped investors illegally transfer billions of dollars out of Russia.

-0.72,"Bengaluru: Flipkart chief financial officer Sanjay Baweja resigned this month, barely two years after he joined the online marketplace. Baweja, 56, is a veteran CFO, having held senior roles at Tata Communications Ltd, Emaar MGF and Bharti Airtel Ltd. He was hired to set up badly needed processes and systems, cut losses and prepare Flipkart for an eventual IPO. In an interview, Baweja spoke about why he left Flipkart ahead of plan, his achievements and dismissed allegations of fraud against him. Edited excerpts:
Why leave now?In the past two years, weve been able to expand the market in a big way. Weve been able to bring a lot of new customers into the fold, bringing more cities into play, bringing more pin codes into play. Thats happened because weve been focused on innovation; weve launched new stuff like product exchange, no-cost EMI. Weve built a very strong leadership team, especially in finance. From the time Ive come till now, the processes weve put in place, the standards of governanceits been a remarkable journey. We have the audit on a quarterly basis; the accounting closes on day 4-5 (of a given month); were on our way to SOX compliance (requirement under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the US). So, all of this allowed me to think that now that the company is in strong hands, I can move on to something fresh, something else I wanted to do.Where are you going after Flipkart?Im not at liberty to disclose that as of now.Much of the senior management that oversaw Flipkarts disastrous performance in the year ended March 2016 have been removed or have left. Does your exit have anything to do with this?No, my exit is about what I wanted rather than the other way round.How well prepared is Flipkart for an IPO? Any visibility on when an IPO will happen?Now that I have left Flipkart I cant talk about the timing. But as far as preparedness is concerned, we have transitioned. We are on our SOX compliance road map; we are meeting international standards. Like I said, we are doing quarterly audits, we close our books on a monthly basis on day 5 (of the next month). So, from the structure perspective, which Im used to delivering, were well on our way to being prepared. Now, the preparedness also has to come from a business perspective. Thats where the company will still take some time before it goes on the IPO journey.An anonymous Twitter handle has accused you of fraud and said that your exit was because of this alleged fraud. According to the Twitter handle Unicon Baba, Flipkart, at your behest, paid Tata Communications 30% more than it was paying its previous data centre supplier. Comment?Ive read it and its an absolute load of crap. We have robust processes. When we do an RFP (request for proposal) we invite people to bid for it. In this case, they (Tata Communications) were the only ones who could have delivered. When Chennai went down (during last years floods), our data centre was up and running. We went for the servers that were technically the most superior and lowest cost. I dont know where this 30% is coming from. Theres no inquiry. Nothing of this kind has come up.In the past two years, some senior leaders from established companies  who came to Indian Internet firms havent fit in and have had bitter experiences. Do you regret joining Flipkart?Not at all. Ive enjoyed every bit of the last two years. I enjoyed putting in the frameworks, the processes, the feeling of growing the company. When I was at TCL (Tata Communications Ltd), I had a great time. And then I took the call to come here. So, you take calls at some points in your career. I think Flipkart will go places and I will benefit eventually.ALSO READ | Flipkart CFO Sanjay Baweja resigns, replacement unclear",2016-10-27,cg7uvQRScEay19U9nF8X7O,"Outgoing CFO Sanjay Baweja on why he left Flipkart ahead of plan, his achievements and allegations of fraud against him",both,04:00,Flipkart is in strong hands now: Outgoing CFO Sanjay Baweja
-0.4,"In an interview on the sidelines of Dell World 2016 in Austin, Texas, on 19 October, Michael Dell, chairman and chief executive of the worlds largest privately-controlled technology company, Dell Technologies, shared his views on the prospects for the combined Dell-EMC. Edited excerpts:
In a world of smartphones, you remain committed to a PC-centric world. Why? We listen to customers. I did not say that smartphones are not important. I believe its a multi-device world. In 2012, the idea was smartphones here and PCs thereits not correct now. In organizations, smartphones and PCs coexist in a multi-device world. The view around that time (that the) PC was dead created an opportunity for us. Many customers are not giving up on PCs. Liken this to transportation, where people use different modes like bicycles, cars, trains and planes. Computing is like that too with tablets, smartphones, PCs, etc. PCs offer another way of computing.But PCs, servers, storage, etc. are commoditized businesses... ...in the PC segment, we have gained share for 15 quarters in a row. We are doing very well, we are growing. When a commercial client chooses Dell PCs, it chooses us for the services and support and also Intel and AMD (Advanced Micro Devices Inc.) and Microsoft. Its another way of saying these are our suppliers that have a higher share. Therefore, we should be more concerned about our suppliers if margin erosion is a concern. ALSO READ | Will Dell make it big with EMC?One of the reasons for our success is because we have brought tremendous value for our customers, democratized technology by making it more available and more affordable. There is no shortage of competitors in the business we are in. We need to provide high levels of service, continue to innovate, build great relationships and customers will reward us.How are you tackling issues around cultural challenges in the merged Dell-EMC entity? We had a decade-and-a-half lead-up to the combination. And it goes back to 2001 when we had announced an alliance called Dell EMC. The apparent intent was that Dell was going to sell EMC storage technologies to its customers. We did billions of dollars of sales. Under the cover, Dell server technology was embedded into pretty much every storage product line that existed and EMC became our largest OEM (original equipment manufacturer) customer in the world. And so our teams, beginning 2001, learnt how to work together in terms of supply chain, R&D, sales and importantly culturewe became friends.The businesses dont have a lot of overlap. In 2009, we had a fairly in-depth look at whether we should combine the companiesreams of analyses, we had consultants from both companies, we had directors from the boards of both the public companies meeting secretly in places, and we were negotiating combining both the companies. However, because of the financial crisis at that time, we decided not to do so.Then, in 2013, we took the company private. Everyone thought the PC was dead. So, we bought the company back. Thank you very much. And in 2014, I called my friend Joe Tucci (Joseph Tucci is the former chairman, president and chief executive officer of EMC) and said, Why dont we re-examine what we looked at five years earlier, refresh all the analyses and see if it makes sense now? So, that was more than two years ago, which resulted in our October 2015 result.I got some great advice. I talked to a number of executives who had gone through a number of combinations like thesesome had succeeded; some had failed. One of the things that a number of them said: You should as early you can, communicate the strategy of the new company and its structure. They also said, with all due respect to the current CEO of EMC, you should act as if you were leading the new company from the day of the announcement of the planned merger, not the closure date. Legally, you are not supposed to do that. And I didnt break any laws.ALSO READ | Dell Technologiess road map for IndiaI was very present within EMC from the day of the announcementat the leadership meetings, meeting the whole team, learning about the teams, and as we come together as one family and the cultures are a lot more similar than different.Whats the strategy you are employing to handle a smooth integration? We communicated the hierarchies within the organization to our teams. Not everyone has got exactly the job they want. Given the all-star teams we have in the combined Dell-EMC group, we effectively have an Olympic team. You must always start with the strategy. If you do it by personality or anything else, it will be a totally wrong way to do it. From the strategy, you must define the structure to achieve the strategy. You lay out the strategy. Then find out who are the people from within, or outside, the organization for each role to accomplish the strategy.For each role, you have several candidates. So you find the jobare you excited about the job, are you passionate.

-0.25,"The announcement of the imminent commercial launch of services by its telecom unitReliance Jio Infocomm Ltdat its annual general meeting has augured well for the Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) stock. Its share price has risen 7.5% from its recent low on 2 September. But its worth remembering that the stock has been an underperformer compared to the benchmark Sensex so far this year.
				   
				If you thought September quarter results would change sentiments dramatically, you are likely be disappointed. Stand-alone revenues have declined year-on-year but better operating profit margin, strong other income growth, and decline in finance and depreciation costs have helped the company report 20% growth in its pre-tax earnings. But that wont impress investors. Heres why: stand-alone Ebitda for September quarter came in at Rs10,555 crore. A poll of Bloomberg analysts was expecting the companys Ebitda at Rs10,569 crore. Thats pretty much in line. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.Unlike the June quarter when RILs gross refining margin (GRM) had surprised the Street positively, this quarter was fairly lukewarm. To be fair, GRM of $10.1 a barrel is not bad at all. The companys premium over Singapore GRM has dropped to $5 a barrel from as much as $6.5 a barrel. But investors are unlikely to punish the stock for that. For one, the companys GRM margin is slightly better than some brokerage firms estimates. Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd was expecting a GRM of $10 a barrel while analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd had forecasted a GRM between $9.5-10 a barrel.What really came as a big surprise this quarter is the performance of the petrochemicals business. According to the company, consolidated petrochemicals Ebit margin expanded to a 14-quarter high of 15.2% for the September quarter as product deltas held up well despite lower prices. Delta is the rate of change in prices compared with the change in unit costs. Strong volume growth also helped. Stand-alone petrochemicals Ebit increased to 16.3%, higher sequentially as well as on a year-on-year basis.As usual, the oil and gas business was a laggard, with Ebit declining as much as 83% year-on-year, adversely impacted by lower upstream production in domestic blocks along with lower prices. Sure, RILs organized retail business has done well but the segment is too small to make a big difference to overall numbers.On a consolidated basis, the companys debt service coverage ratio has declined to 0.88 from 2.79 in the June quarter. Is that a worry? According to independent analyst S.P. Tulsian, the decline in debt service coverage ratio should hardly be a concern for a company with RILs cash flows. Other analysts say the fall in the debt service ratio below 1 is just for one quarter and should not be extrapolated.What of the stock? Currently, RIL trades at 12.4 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year. Valuations arent exactly cheap considering that the refining environment is still sluggish. So far this quarter, benchmark Singapore GRM has averaged only marginally higher at $5.3 a barrel, says an analyst. RILs net debt has increased by about Rs10,000 crore sequentially to Rs1.06 trillion. Investors should watch out for that measure in the days to come. It goes without saying that news flow on the telecom ramp-up will be crucial for the RIL stock.",2016-10-21,cseZPkWnNdtky8J0DNe3oI,"News flow on RILs telecom business, Reliance Jio, and its commercial launch, will be crucial for the companys stock",both,03:48,"RIL meets Q2 results expectations, but all eyes on Reliance Jio"
-0.54,"At a time when companies are switching their business models to digital, cybersecurity has become a boardroom concern, for its implications now directly affect the balance sheet. However, its becoming increasingly difficult to objectively quantify a companys cyber risk considering the dynamic nature of an organizations perimeter, which in most cases cannot be distinctively defined thanks to BYOD (bring your own device), BYOA (bring your own access) and Dynamic DNS set-ups among others. The other component hindering quantification is the known unknown attack vectors. 
				   
				Reports estimate that the overall cost of cybercrime will touch $2 trillion (around Rs135 trillion) by 2019. Very recently in India, we saw 3.2 million debit cards being hacked; we have seen the largest bank in the worldJP Morgan Chasebeing hacked even though it spends $300 million on cybersecurity annually. We have seen companies headquartered in the Silicon Valley, built by the best tech minds from around the world, being hackedamong them Yahoo and Twitter. These examples clearly indicate that there is no such thing called 100% security. As in the physical world, the digital world also cannot be secured completely; it will be all about managing and mitigating risks.Cyberspace is continuously changing and evolving. In the future, companies will have to look at a three-dimensional approach of proactively protecting their digital stacks via technology and process-level controls, continuously monitor incidents and events and respond in the quickest and most efficient way possible in case there is an incident. Clear heat maps of data sets versus threat actors such as insiders, competitors, hacktivists, state-sponsored hackers, terrorists, script kiddies and organized criminals will be mapped specific to the industry and the company to prioritize security efforts. At the government level, recognizing the strategic dimensions of cyberspace, the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) created the position of  national cyber security coordinator in 2014, which is a great move. I feel Reserve Bank of India initiatives such as ReBIT (Reserve Bank Information Technology Pvt. Ltd) will enable the much required streamlining of financial services, IT and information security from a regulatory compliance standpoint. The recent push to have an independent payments regulator highlighted in the recent budget by the finance minister is another positive step in this direction.The future of hacking from a techies lens looks very, very exciting. We have already seen an explosion of on-demand hacking services like Haas (hacking as a service), and this will only expand in the future. From script kiddies to a bustling underground marketplace of tailor-made targeted DIY (do-it-yourself) exploits that have 24x7 support, along with the release of continuously enhanced and more sophisticated versions of a malwareits all now just a few clicks and a few hundred dollars away. With other hack enablers such as bot nets readily available to be purchased by the hour, the possibilities of a normal tech enthusiast executing a successful hack go up exponentially.With faster and cheaper computing power readily available, we will see the rise of more complex crypto algorithms with longer key values. This isnt all good news, for complex crypto is always a double-edged swordon the one hand, it does make it hard for a hacker to decipher the data both in motion and at rest; on the other, it becomes extremely difficult to decrypt system files affected by ransomware or doxware.We have been hearing about the shift from a signature-based analysis system to a behaviour and context-based system for quite some time now, but thanks to machine learning and artificial intelligence, I feel we will be able to take tangible steps towards this very soon. AI (artificial intelligence) and ML (machine learning) will also play an extremely important role in real-time learning about individuals from available data over the Internet to create a mind map (which will get more accurate as the data set increases) of an individual you might meet for the first timetaking the entire privacy debate to an absolutely new level. Not to forget the possible implication of an artificial intelligence attack on the Internetsomething thats only a matter of time, in the words of SpaceXs Elon Musk.There will be a clear shift to objective and quantized cyber risk management techniques that will incorporate the known unknowns to make cyber risk an informed business decision. The attack surface will not be restricted to internal IT but will extend to third parties, cloud providers and social media, among others. The focus in the future will not only be on security products but on building secure products from the ground up.The way we are adopting digital, with a clear push coming from the top in both private and public set-ups, technology is going to take centre stage in the success of most new initiatives. And while this happens, the key for the industry will be to learn from cyber attacks and embed the learnings into our defence systems as quickly as possible.

				The scrip had already declined by about 20% from the time the bitter feud between Ratan Tata and Cyrus Mistry started. But investors hope that its UK-subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover Ltds (JLRs) robust numbers would offset the effect of the boardroom brawls has been belied.Barring consolidated net revenue of Rs66,999.7 crore that came close to the average of analysts estimates compiled by Bloomberg, the results disappointed on all other fronts. Consolidated net profit at Rs848 crore, although better than the Rs1,740 crore loss of the year-ago period, was about one-third the forecast. The company attributed this to a huge realized hedging loss and a commodity derivatives impact. A ripple effect of Brexit perhaps.Whats hard to fathom is that JLRs operating margin at 12.9% was nearly 70 basis-points below Bloombergs average. And this is excluding currency hedging losses and the unfavourable revaluation of current assets and liabilities. While details of these one-time items were not available at the time of going to press, they are large enough to hurt investor sentiment. A basis point is 0.01%.Meanwhile, the companys Indian business is facing greater distress. Stand-alone operating margin failed to mirror improvement in commercial vehicle performance. It fell to 2.7% against a forecast of around 6%, and the year-ago margin of 6.8%. In fact, the quarters robust jump in sales volume had raised hopes for a sharper earnings turnaround. This hints at weaker realizations on sales, perhaps reflecting discounts given to push sales. Net loss at Rs630 crore was higher than the median forecast of a Rs20 crore loss.Incidentally, it is the domestic entitys performance that has become a bone of contention in the Tata-Mistry fight. A media release last week said Tata Motors market share in commercial vehicles dropped from 60% in fiscal year 2013 to 40% in FY16hard to accept for a firm that has been the market leader for decades. Also, the drop comes in the last couple of years when the truck segment was northbound and when its arch-rival and competitor Ashok Leyland Ltds share has inched up. Thats not all. Tata Motors passenger car share of the overall market also plunged from 13% to 5%. That said, all investor hopes were pegged on JLR. But this too disappointed. The only silver lining among the host of negatives at this juncture is the stocks reasonable valuation. At Rs510, it trades at about 10 times the estimated earnings for FY18, which is reasonable given JLRs growth prospects. So, any management assurance that the September quarters exceptionally high losses are a one-off and strong sales numbers from JLR may see the stock recover.",2016-11-15,dJKoZ5qKObg92TdK1e8l0L,"Tata Motors Q2 profit stood at Rs848 crore, better than Rs1,740 crore loss in the year-ago period, was about one-third the forecast",competitor,07:47,"Tata Motors results: JLR belies investors hope, even as Tata-Mistry battle rages"

Government spending on this sector will touch Rs3.96 trillion in the next fiscal. As banks have been struggling with a large number of stressed cases in the infrastructure segment, fresh investments will get the ball rolling and hopefully turn around some of those companies that have been defaulting.ALSO READ: Budget 2017: Jaitley gives infrastructure a massive pushOther measures that will boost credit growth include affordable housing projects being given infrastructure status and the highest target for farm credit at Rs10 trillion. After the governments move to withdraw Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes on 8 November, bank credit growth has fallen to around 5%, the lowest in a couple of decades. Another positive announcement for the banking sector was the governments comparatively tame net market borrowing figure of Rs3.48 trillion in 2017-18, as compared with Rs4.25 trillion in the current year. The net borrowing figure takes into account the securities that will be bought back, Jaitley said.Capital expenditure data provided in the budget document reveals that the gross market borrowing is set at Rs5.8 trillion for the new financial year, which is approximately the same as 2016-17. Jaitley also said the government proposes to increase allowable provision for non-performing asset (NPA) from 7.5% to 8.5%. This will reduce the tax liability of banks, he said. Allowable provision is the amount of bad loan provision that is tax deductible.ALSO READ: Budget 2017: Affordable housing to be given infrastructure statusCapital infusion of Rs10,000 crore for recapitalization of PSU Banks will be a morale booster in scenarios where Banks are in dire need of capital for Credit growth and Basel III compliance.

				Jack Dorsey, Twitters chief executive officer, argued that the 10-year-old company should remain on its current course and work to capitalize on recent product improvements and success in streaming live video, people familiar with the discussions said. Ev Williams, a former CEO who has a history of clashing with Dorsey, was in favour of exploring a sale. Other directors agreed they had a fiduciary duty to consider that option. The board ultimately decided to consider takeover prospects after getting an expression of interest from a potential acquirer, which led it to hire Goldman Sachs and Allen & Co. to evaluate possible bids.After pitching the San Francisco-based social network, the bankers received inquiries from suitors which so far include Disney and Salesforce, with Google also weighing a potential bid. This week, the board is consulting with other outside advisers on how to deal with the internal disagreement over a possible sale, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the process is private. Formal bids could come within a couple of weeksor not at all.Though its fate is in flux, one thing is clear: A year after he officially took back the reins as CEO, Jack Dorsey has either ceded or lost at least some control over the future of the company he helped create. On the board, he may be overruled by fellow directors on the future of Twitter as an independent company. Within his management team, hes largely delegated command of Twitters strategy to chief financial officer Anthony Noto. And among advertisers, Twitters fortunes are being constrained by its stagnant user numbers, which Dorseys product changes have failed to significantly boost, and by growing concern about harassment and abuse on its service.Also Read: Possible Disney merger with Twitter poses risks for Bob Iger legacyThe lack of growth in users and engagement underscore that Jacks initiatives thus far havent really been effective, said Robert Peck, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. If this whole live idea doesnt work, then what is it that gets Twitter to grow?Twitter spokeswoman Kristin Binns declined to comment on the boards discussions about a potential sale process. Asked to provide perspective on Dorseys progress, Binns said in an e-mail that the CEO has met the goals he outlined a year ago and made significant strides in each of his priorities for the company. The company has been rolling out products faster than ever, she noted, and has boosted engagement through enhancements to the timeline, such as showing people the most relevant tweets first. She also cited the companys advancements and partnerships in live video streaming, including deals to broadcast NFL games and presidential debates.As Twitters first CEO, Dorsey was initially known as a detail-obsessed micromanager. He was ousted in 2008, then brought back to Twitterwhich was having trouble attracting new usersto apply vision and direction with the kind of authority that only a founder can bring.But Dorsey hasnt seemed interested in being the sole authority on Twitters future, according to insiders. While he was away from Twitter, he built a credit-card reader company, Square Inc., and learned the importance of trusting others with strategic decisions. His leadership style in the past year at Twitter has been Socratic, not prescriptive, these people said. Hell ask open-ended questions to spark debate, like, Are we preventing people from expressing themselves fully with our 140-character tweet limit? What would a different solution look like?Also Read: Twitter bidders vying for data would inherit the doldrums tooThe discussions eventually lead to solutions, like Twitters move last month to exclude photos and attachments from a tweets character total. But the process takes time. And that passive, contemplative style created a void in management that Noto has stepped in to fill, people said.Noto has been just as responsible, just as influential at the company as Jack, said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. Hes been unusually active as a CFO.Earlier this year, Noto told Twitters other senior staff that he intended to bid for the rights to stream 10 Thursday night National Football League games. He wasnt expecting to win, but he wanted to try, according to people familiar with the conversations.Noto, who is a former CFO of the NFL, did winfor the bargain price of $10 million, lower than what others were willing to pay. That kicked off a string of other deals in sports, politics and entertainment, centered on making Twitter accessible to a wider audience through live video they can watch for free. The first NFL game drew 2.3 million users, and the next one got 2.4 million, hinting at the potential for a growing audience, according to the company.Its not that Dorsey has been uninvolved. On the contrary, his employees say he answers e-mails so quickly that its difficult to imagine how he has the time, given that hes also still CEO of Square. During his first month at Twitter, he cut 8% of the workforce. He recruited new board members like Debra Lee, the CEO of BET, and Hugh Johnston, the CFO of Pepsico, to add executive experience. Hes helped the strategy by providing a long-term perspective on the business and focused on a single concept to help drive it: live.But if Dorsey is the introverted deep thinker, Noto is the doer. Hes the high-energy cheerleader who has cut through indecision at the company and rallied Twitters employees around a future of live video streaming, boosted by licensing of premium content. (Twitter has partnered with Bloomberg LP to stream some Bloomberg TV shows, as well as the presidential debates.) Its unusual for a companys CFO to be leading its product vision, and even rarer at a technology company.Twitters engineers have long grappled with how to make the service easier to use, cycling through six heads of product in six years. Notos deal-making provided them with a unique solution: to make video an entry point to the Twitter experience. Twitter recently released streaming applications for Apple TV, Xbox and Amazon Fire TV, letting viewers pick content that streams alongside related tweets, and sidestepping the need for people to create an account and decide who to followpreviously a cumbersome prerequisite of using Twitter.Twitter hired Noto in 2014 with more than $60 million in stock options, following a career in banking at Goldman Sachs, where he helped Twitter go public. Its unclear whether Noto supports a Twitter sale. But he did recently retain Goldman to look at other options, like selling off assets besides the core business, according to people familiar. Notos presence at the company has long been a comfort to investors, with many figuring that if it came time to sell, he would know how to get it done.Even as the company gains ground in streaming, Dorsey is being forced to reconsider Twitters future in part because its lack of user growth. US average monthly users have hovered around 66 million for six quarters. Revenue, which more than doubled in 2014, is projected to rise just 15% this year, and to slow further next year.Advertisers see potential in the companys live video strategy, but theyre also being wooed by photo- and video-sharing app Snapchat, and Facebooks Instagram, which has recently become more advertiser-friendly. At the time of Twitters 2013 initial public offering, those services werent close competitors. Now they both have larger daily audiences than Twitter.Also Read: Twitter could take many forms, depending on new ownerTwitter budgets have slowly gone down and down and down, said James Douglas, who consults with advertisers on their spending as executive director of social media for Society, an agency within IPG Mediabrands whose clients include Coca-Cola and Red Bull. Its kind of hard to compel clients who had an experience with Twitter that wasnt good, or have the perception that Twitters audience is declining. Everyone has questions for them, Douglas said.Tom Buontempo, the president of Attention, the social arm of ad firm KBS, said hes seen the trend worsen in recent months. Its all a matter of where people are spending their time, he said. Im starting to hear more clients consider whether or not they need to be on Twitter at all. Attentions clients include BMW, Mattel and Lincoln Financial, though Buontempo wouldnt say who is pulling back.When Twitters CEO search committee was looking to replace Dick Costolo in 2015, they made calls to major investors, asking for input and floating Dorseys name as a contender. Some investors expressed their skepticism, given that Dorsey was already a large influence on Costolo, and could already impact the companys direction through his executive chairman role.Still, one year ago this week, Twitters board was jubilant on a conference call announcing the decision to bring back Dorsey permanently. Dorsey would help us achieve what we see as a massive opportunity to grow the company, Peter Currie, who helped lead the search and has since left the board, said at the time. The board has been pleased and impressed with the strategy, vision and alignment around goals coming from the Twitter teams these last few months, and there is much more the world hasnt seen just yet.Perhaps there is more to come. But some investors havent been willing to wait.Twitters stock had dropped about 20% this year before reports began to surface about the company considering a sale. Even one of its largest and earliest investors, Chris Sacca, a vocal critic of Twitters strategy under Costolo and proponent of bringing back Dorsey, has sold a large part of his stake, he told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday.Brad Slingerlend, who manages the global technology fund for Janus Capital Group, holds Facebook, Google, Amazon and Applebut sold Twitter after Dorsey took over. Social networking, he said, is a business that depends on a network effect to generate growth. If the networks momentum starts to ebb, its difficult to recover.The best-case scenario, Slingerlend said, would be an acquisition by Disney. As Twitter becomes more of a media company, the two make for a good fit, he said. And Disneys CEO, Bob Iger, has experience bringing a brand back to life.Jack is a good entrepreneur, Slingerlend said. But Twitter needs a turnaround CEO, and thats a completely different job. Bloomberg",2016-10-07,dpyqCrv7e3VSybEzZJ4glL,"A year after Jack Dorseys return as Twitter s CEO, live-streaming and new products havent revived growth",both,19:32,How Jack Dorsey is losing control of Twitter
-0.27,"The first green revolution, helmed by visionary scientists like Norman Borlaug and M.S. Swaminathan, born of a near-death food crisis, turned around Indian agriculture through an increase in farming land, development and use of grains hardened against pests, use of fertilizers and pesticides, multiple cropping, higher farmer credit and better irrigation techniques.
				   
				While it rescued India from starvation in the 1960s, there are dark clouds over Indian agriculture again. Over the years, our gross domestic product (GDP) has grown by 7.5% annually, but agricultural growth has severely lagged at 3%. In another 30 years time, India will have 1.5 billion people, with growing incomes, and the demand for foodgrain is expected to almost double to 450 million tonnes. Moreover, our farmers are dying; 8,000 of them committed suicide last year, that is 22 farmers every single day. Moreover, in the first four months of 2016, 100 farmers committed suicide every month in Marathwada alone.Why is this happening? Our farmers do not earn enough to feed themselves and repay their debts. Calculations show that the average farmer household in India makes Rs6,426 a month, and needs to have at least 1 hectare of land to make ends meet. However, 65% of farmers have less than one hectare, and so must take debt to make ends meet. More than 50% of farmers are indebted, and the average outstanding loan of a farmer is Rs47,000, usually at a usurious interest rate.Our current farming practices are not going to solve it. To feed our population, we need to double agricultural yield, store and transport it better, and enable it with the right insurance and credit. And to make this next quantum jump happen, what we need is a second green revolutionone not based on land, chemicals, or water but on data, digital technologies and drones. Agriculture technology, or AgTech, will fuel the digital transformation of this most ancient of all industries.I believe the second green revolution will be based on five transformative digital agri-technologies:Technology-enabled advisory: Information is power; for the farmer, it is gold, and can mean the difference between a bountiful harvest and a disastrous crop. When to harvest, where to sell the produce, how much to sell it for, what to sow next, which inputs (seeds, fertilisers, etc.) are needed, where to get them at the best price, when is it likely to rain, when will the water comefor all these questions, answers traditionally have come from a farmers experience, or the neighbouring farmers, and sometimes, an extension worker provided by the government, or a private service like Mahindra Shubhlabh. However, the new advisor for the farmer will be his mobile phone. Imagine a tech-enabled advisory app on the phone, with image-recognition, speech-enablement, vernacular languages, and powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning technology, and cloud databases. Think of a farmer who sees a diseased leaf, clicks its picture and sends it to a cloud, where the image is analysed and the details of the leaf disease sent back to the farmer, with suggested remedies, places to procure these services, and possible government subsidies available for the same. An advisory service which can answer a farmers questions on the go will be the single most powerful tool to drive up yields and productivity.Precision farming: This is a data-driven approach to raise farm yields by using GIS (geographical information system) data, soil information, and weather and environmental conditions for a specific small piece of land, by optimising the choice of crop, the use of pesticides, water and fertilisers, and the decision as to when and how to spray, till, and harvest the crop. The precise nature of this technology is especially useful for Indias very small farm holdings; 65% of land holdings are less than 2 hectares (the average in the US is 180 hectares.) It is estimated that precision farming has been responsible for more than 80% of total increase in yields of wheat, rice and maize over the last 50 years. In fact, a large pilot in India, the Tamil Nadu Precision Farming Project, raised crop yields by 60-80% for 23 different kinds of crops. Precision farming works with the use of GPS (Global Positioning System) and GIS (global information system) data, cheap IoT (Internet of Things) sensors in the soil which track moisture, Nitrogen levels, etc. and feeds the data back to an analytics engine in the cloud, which then recommends the right timing and techniques of inputs.Real-time market information: The Indian farmer sells most of his produce to a middleman for price lower than he can get, because he does not have the right, current market information. He cannot make the right decision on what to plant, since he does not know the patterns and forecasting of price. Mobile phones and cheap data plans can change all that. The e-Choupal network of ITC, for instance, has created more than 6000 e-Choupals and networked four million farmers, who exchange information with each other. A query-able content repository in the cloud can make real-time market information and analytics available to individual farmers.Tech-enabled supply chain: The farm supply chain in India is broken; we can store only 10% of the fresh produce we grow30% of it rots. Building more warehouses and cold chains will certainly help; however, technologies like IoT, bar coding and blockchain can help monitor the produce from farm to market and cut down the extent of spoilage and loss.Tech-enabled insurance: While crop insurance exists, an overwhelming majority of crops are not insured, leaving the farmer severely indebted when his crop fails. Technology and information, from sources like IBMs Weather Company and Skymet, can be used to predict weather patterns and therefore derive more precise premiums and insurance covers for small farmers. Smart contracts on blockchain-based technologies can be used for automatic pay-outs, discouraging on-ground field assessment.There are a bunch of startups and large companies operating in the AgTech area. Before Monsanto bought an AgTech company called Climate Corp. for close to $1 billion, no one paid much attention to this part of the digital wave. Climate Corp, set up by two ex-Googlers, is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their farms, and then suggests ways to ameliorate them. In India, too, scores of AgTech startups are coming up. Agrostar and Bighaat enable e-commerce and doorstep delivery of seeds, chemicals and accessories; Ninjacart, FarmerUncle and MeraKisan enable e-commerce of produce for a direct farmer-to-doorstep delivery. Cropin and Airwood are making the enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management of agriculture; Stellapps makes dairy management tools integrated with IoT, cloud, mobility and analytics; Flybird is in precision farming while Trringo, from the Mahindra Group, is building an Uber for tractors and farm machinery. AgTech specific funds and accelerators like Omnivore Partners, Villgro and Village Capital are coming up, reflecting the bullishness in the sector. The government, too, has stepped into the act with the Prime Minister launching eNAM (electronic National Agricultural Market), which aims to link 200 wholesale markets or mandis to achieve the ambitious goal of doubling farmers income by 2022.Data is the new soilFor these tech companies, data is the new soilto be mined and analysed. There is a new mathematics of farmingwhat was measured in acres is now measured in square foot, enabling more micro-farming and precision agriculture. Agriculture is being platformized, with platform models being applied to create market places and on-demand models for machinery, inputs and produce.As the digital revolution rolls across India, agriculture is its last, and most important, frontier. Today, we are seeing perhaps the dawn of the second green revolution. While there is a long way to go, the true success of Digital India will be if it helps 70% of our populationagricultural workers and farmers.The archetypal impression of the Indian farmer has been a wizened, gnarled man sitting in his parched field, shading his eyes from the merciless sun and gazing at the clouds, willing them to rain. Perhaps, soon, that will change to him expectantly looking at the data cloud through his mobile phone, waiting for it to spew out the information and knowledge, to add to his wisdom. That is when we will know that the Second Green Revolution has arrived.Jaspreet Bindra is senior vice- president of digital transformation at Mahindra Group.

				Indias banks have been caught out by Prime Minister Narendra Modis unexpected and widely-praised announcement late on Tuesday of the withdrawal of Rs500  and Rs1,000 notes, part of a crackdown on tax evasion and the underground economy. The now-worthless notes account for 86% of money in circulation, leaving many Indians with little or no cash.Printing of a new Rs2,000 note is ongoing, but work has only just begun on the replacement Rs500 notes, said an official in the finance ministry, who asked not to be identified because the official isnt authorized to speak to the media. Banknote shortages are likely to continue into next month, the official added. Finance ministry spokesman D.S. Malik didnt respond to calls seeking comments.Armed soldiers and security officers were deployed outside banks to manage the growing crowds, who so far have waited patiently to exchange their currency. Banks are restricting withdrawals to Rs4,000 per person, adding to the cash shortages.ALSO READ: Banks run out of new notes, shares slumpPushpendra Pankaj, a worker at New Delhis municipal council, said he had been waiting for one and a half hours at the Canara Bank branch near Parliament House to exchange his old Rs500 notes. He said he had been told that the bank server had crashed, but was prepared to stay in line as he needed money for household expenses.Its a good move by the government to curb black money, but it is full of hassles for common people like us, said Pankaj.ATMs unpreparedCompounding the problem is the need to reconfigure the countrys 220,000 cash machines so that they can dispense the new Rs500 and Rs2,000 notes, which do not fit into the existing cash trays in the ATMs, according to Navroze Dastur, the managing director for India and South Asia at NCR Corp., which supplies about two-thirds of the countrys ATMs. Dastur said it will take some time to adjust all the ATMs. Until then, the machines can only dispense low-denomination Rs100 notes, which are increasingly in short supply.The long queues outside Indias banks are a sign that the government was ill-equipped to deal with such a huge transition, said Manoj Joshi, a fellow with the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation. The whole exercise is premised on the fact that youll be able to implement it quickly and effectively. Governments in India simply dont have that ability. The central bank in a statement on Friday said banks have enough cash though it may take lenders time to revamp the ATMs.State electionsPolitical rivals of Modis Bharatiya Janata Party were relaying images of the chaos on social media. The opposition Congress party tweeted photos of its party workers bringing chai (tea) to ordinary people standing in line, while the Bahujan Samaj Partywhich is hoping to beat the BJP in upcoming Uttar Pradesh state electionswas tweeting news reports on the long lines outside ATMs.ALSO READ: Rahul Gandhi visits bank to exchange old notes, hits out at Narendra ModiAxis Bank Ltd., the countrys third-largest private lender, said it was working on refilling its 13,000 ATMs with after they started to run out of cash soon after being loaded up on Wednesday.Yesterday, banks ran short of cash around noon, Joshi said. And were only talking about Delhi.

				Its 3pm. Pramath Raj Sinha hasnt had lunch. The 52-year-old entrepreneur had flown into Mumbai that morning and had just finished speaking at a business school event on education. Sinha was the founding dean of the Indian School of Business (ISB), Hyderabad, and is co-founder of Ashoka University, Sonipat, Haryana. His most recent venture is the Vedica Scholars Programme for Women in Delhi, an alternative masters in business administration (MBA) programme. This all-women residential programme tries to address the problem that far more women graduate from high school than men, but get left behind in careers. Sinha says he was inspired by institutions like Wellesley College of Massachusetts, US, where women get the confidence to express themselves. The Vedica curriculum includes subjects that many conventional MBAs neglect, like politics, sociology and history. The first batch of 36 Vedica scholars has just graduated and Sinha informs me that one student has received an offer from Google at a starting salary of Rs22 lakh.By now we have settled into our seaside seats and turned our attention to the menu. We debate the relative merits of keema ghotala (a spicy Parsi keema with bread), a smoked salmon sandwich or a BLT burger, and end up settling for the latter two. Sinha grew up in Patna, in a house with a printing press. His father and grandfather were writers. Writing didnt pay all the bills, so Sinhas father started a small textbook-publishing business to supplement his income and pay for the education of his four childrenthree daughters and Pramath, who was the youngest. Sinha recalls going on marketing trips with his father in winter. We called it canvassing; we would fill the car with calendars and diaries and call on schoolteachers with these gifts. I thought it was a lot of fun; only later I realized it was serious marketing, he says. Years later, it was another printing press that drew Sinha back to the country of his birth. By then, he was an alumnus of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, with a PhD in applied mechanics and robotics from the University of Pennsylvania, US, and had been working as a consultant since 1993 with McKinsey & Co. in Toronto. And then one day he was assigned to a project on newsprint. The project was  in Canada, but it had an India component. Sinha tells me about the days he spent in India at the time, visiting newspaper offices and finally working at the Ballarpur Industries paper plant as part of the project. It was an almost surreal existence. At one level you are working for McKinsey, which in Toronto was boardrooms and office and always talking to CEOs. Here in India, I was in a paper plant in Haryana, living in a guest house with an Indian toilet and a dhobi visiting every day. We were sitting in our ganjis every night because it was so hot. Hanging out with the workers, speaking in Bhojpuri with the Bihari labourers, having shouting matches with the union. Such experiences, and work in the newsprint and media sector in India, made Sinha want to return. He started working with McKinsey India in 1995 on a project basis and moved full-time in 1997.By now the salmon sandwich and the BLT burger have arrived, and we have half portions of each, complete with fries. Sinha begins talking about the ISB story. He was involved with the institute right from the planning stage and even took a year off from McKinsey to be the founding dean. The story has all the elements of high dramaa cast of powerful industrialists, including Adi Godrej, Anand Mahindra and Rajat Gupta, chief ministers, and complicated negotiations. Most of these took place 1999 onwards, but for Sinha, the introduction to education and institutions had come even earlier.In 1995, McKinsey India began working on a project with management guru Kenichi Ohmae and then Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, on ways to transform that country into a knowledge economy. Sinha was assigned to this project, and it became the first of many such university projects for him. A PhD in robotics doesnt make you a guy who knows how to build a university, says Sinha of those early days. But this was where he first began institution-building. The ISB started as a project McKinsey was doing with the Indian Institute of Technology, DelhiSinha has since come out with a book about setting it up, An Idea Whose Time Has Come: The Story Of The Indian School Of Business.Over a cup of Darjeeling first flush, Sinha tells me about the day ISBs board of governors visited three states and three chief ministers. Their first stop was Hyderabad, where then chief minister Chandrababu Naidu pulled out all the stops. The chief minister sent his ratha to receive us, a bus with sofa seats, and we were taken to the site for the business school. On the way back to the airport, the bus was redirected to the CMs house. He welcomed us all, garlanded us and served us breakfast in his house. Afterwards we were taken to an adjoining room and given a presentation on Hyderabad as a knowledge hub, Sinha recalls. The team was charmed, but behind schedule. In Bengaluru, then chief minister J.H. Patel and his team were furious at the delay. The CM didnt speak a single word to us. And then when we reached Chennai, we were asked to garland the CM, Jayalalithaa. We were taken to see the venue which was supposed to have a lake, and we walked and walked to see the lake, but there was no lake. So in one day, we saw three chief ministers, all such contrasts of each other. One garlanded us, the other didnt speak to us and the third wanted us to garland her, Sinha says. Not surprisingly, the ISB was built in Hyderabad. Sinha is currently on its executive and governing boards.From being the founding dean of ISB, Sinha returned to work at McKinsey in 2002, then left to head the ABP Pvt. Ltd as the groups managing director and CEO in 2006. In 2007, he set up his own media company, 9.9 Mediaworx Pvt. Ltd. Like much of the media, 9.9 has had uneven economic growth. Its Rs45-crore-turnover business in 2015-16 includes magazines and websites like Digit, CIO, CFO and some consulting projects. In 2010, Sinha tried setting up a business school in Vadodara on the lines of the ISB but had to give up the idea because the school was not able to generate enough demand at the price point he had thought of. Currently, he is working with consulting and implementing project proposals at the Crescent School of Business in Chennai, the Anant National University in Ahmedabad and the Shoolini University in Solan. The Union government is planning a railway university in Vadodara and Sinha plans to bid for that project. Sinha and his wife Gauri live in Delhi. They dont have children, so Sinha says he has all the time to fill my weekends and free time with all the different things I do. By 5pm, Sinha is ready to leave for the airport for his flight back to Delhi. His last meeting for the day is with an alumnus of Ashoka, a Young India fellow.

				How did you start your philanthropic journey?I grew up in a family that was driven by philanthropy. My grandmother with whom we spent a great deal of timeshe brought us up because my parents were separatedinfluenced me. We were steeped into philanthropy, whether it would be for the household staff or the person on the street. She was in fact for a period of time, the chairperson of the Sir Ratan Tata Trust. We grew up in that aura of giving back to the people or alleviating misery if we could. Formally I became involved with philanthropy when I became a trustee of the Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Were there people or incidents or experiences that you used to inform your approach to philanthropy, the formal version of it?As a young man growing up, it was the environment that I spoke of, which set the pace and the tone of my journey of how one makes contributions to make a difference.How is the Sir Ratan Tata Trust changing from its old avatar?We look at our trusts collectively. The bigger ones undertook projects of philanthropy which were very far reaching in those days, be it a cancer hospital or a hotel that would be open to Indians or donations in the interest of tuberculosis. My grandmother gave away all the homes she and her husband had all over India so that sanatoriums for consumptive people, who needed to be isolated, could be made or old peoples homes could be set up. And then a fair amount of philanthropy was in the form of alleviating individual hardships, such as funds for treatment or surgery. We give much more than we did in those days but we are trying to be relevant. We are trying to participate in research for cancer, for diabetes, getting institutes in place to make the treatments affordable and reachable to the common man, looking at agricultural inputs that alleviate poverty in a rural community. What has led to this shift broadly?I cant say that there was a motivator that was defined. For example, one of the big changes has been combating malnutrition today among infants. Just the fact that we are losing so many children in India at infancy. It took only a few weeks of research to realize that we couldnt do that without involving the mother, who is also malnutritioned. We also found out very fast that we couldnt really do much unless we focused on hygiene and sanitation. It become a holistic activity. We undertook pilot projects in eight districts across multiple states to work out the systems for this and its been a real eye-opener. We have received tremendous support from the state government whom we were working with.Any advice for a philanthropist thinking about doing problem solving?The only advice I would give is there is a lot of money that is probably less effectively used or employed because someone has not done enough research on what the problems are. One of the changes we made is that we are no longer a purely grant-giving philanthropic organization. We moved from there into being involved ourselves in some of the projects that we have, we manage them ourselves or jointly with an NGO (non-governmental organization) but not only through an NGO.In the past, we would support an NGO for eight years or 10 years and then move those funds and allocate in another place. You would assume that this community by now would be self-sustaining. But when you withdrew your funds, the NGO collapsed, the community collapsed and you become the most hated person or hated organization there is. Sustainability in development has been a new call and we realize that communities dont need handoutsthey need prosperity and dignity. So our grants today, wherever we give them, put sustainability as one of the mileposts. I mean as far as possible, the idea is to make the community self-sustaining and have the dignity which I think everybody wants. How do you measure your success ?I think to a great extent it is about trying to establish and understanding what the real problems are. You have got to define your goals effectively.What characterizes a professionalized NGO?I cant answer that particularly but sometimes its not scale. Very often an NGO tends to forget the traditional outlooks of a community and ignore it, so that what they try to dohowever well intentioneddoesnt work.What is your assessment of the current state of CSR (corporate social responsibility) in India? And what needs to be done to improve it?I have a sort of philosophical view. The CSR funds have to come from somewhere. I think there would be a fair amount of abuse of these funds and the government will have to do some regulation to make sure that these are effectively used. It would not be a bad thing if the government had defined X number of causes to which you can officially give these funds, which would work for rural prosperity. I think even if large projects, a public works projects, were funded in this way, there is nothing wrong in that but the government may have to define what they are. CSR could become an avenue for innovative thinking on how you can improve the quality of life, and it could be a very powerful toolor it could be wasted. How do you see the state of philanthropy in India?I think the new type of philanthropy that we talked about, that is looking at making donations or making funds available in far-reaching terms, is starting to happen. But a large amount of philanthropy is in the more traditional formsmaybe to build temples or hospitals, not so concerned about what it actually does, but that edifices are created because that establishes that you did A or B or C. I think India has to move like other countries into a more sophisticated form of philanthropy which makes a difference and is designed to make a difference rather than just creating edifices. Do you have a philosophy of philanthropy?If I put it into one sentence, I think you really want to be doing things that make a difference. If you cannot make a difference, if its just water trickling through a tap or leading through a drainage system, its wasteful. Have you changed because of the philanthropy? How has it affected you?Yes I think so. I was the chairman of the trust while I was chairman of Tata Sons. I may have chaired the trust but I didnt spend as much time or have had much depth of involvement as I do today and thats been an eye-opener. I have become more sensitive to the pain and the suffering that exists. I am more involved with where we should do more and where we should be bolder in terms of the amount of money that we allocate. And it also made me more sensitive to the likely abuse of funds.The Bridgespan Group, an adviser and resource for mission-driven leaders and organizations, in partnership with Mint interviewed several philanthropists across India to trace their journeys and share their learningsConversations with Remarkable Givers: India.ALSO READ | Philanthropy benefits the philanthropistALSO READ | How a small donation secures freedomALSO READ | Strategic giving for impact",2016-10-03,eZ5raUtIs7kmScXuchQY9M,Tata Sons chairman emeritus Ratan Tata on why poverty alleviation is key to his philanthropy and why access to natural resources is important to improve lives,competitor,03:03,You really want to be doing things that make a difference: Ratan Tata
0.69,"The rise in crude oil prices, coming on the back of a disruption caused by demonetization, is a double whammy for paint firms. If the liquidity crunch is affecting volumes, higher costs can affect margins if companies decide to absorb the cost so as to not disturb demand.
				   
				The increase in crude oil prices appears to be sustainable so far, as oil-producing countries have agreed to production cuts. This could see an increase in the petroleum-based solvents that paint firms use. If the rising crude prices sees derivatives such as plastics becoming expensive, that can result in higher packaging costs. Lastly, freight costs will increase once fuel prices are hiked.Another key raw material, titanium dioxide (TiO2), has seen prices rise both month-on-month and over a year ago. Firms import their requirement and could see their costs increase as contracts get renewed at higher rates. If lower costs helped firms improve profitability in the past (even if demand was not as strong), they now face a situation where rising costs may eat into margins.If average oil prices increase by a further 10%, the estimated FY18 EPS for consumer firms such as Asian Paints Ltd and Berger Paints India Ltd could be lower by 8%, other things remaining same, cautioned JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd in a recent report. EPS stands for earnings per share.The timing makes it worse. Demonetization has affected decorative paints demand, a segment that is discretionary by nature and cash plays a key role. Our channel check suggests demand in decoratives segment has fallen 40% in November and December. For the industrials segment, volumes have been affected to the tune of 25%, Amit Agarwal, a Kotak Securities analyst said.In a recent Nomura report, the managements of major paint companies such as Asian Paints and Berger Paints said offtake is down, with Berger stating that demand is down to 40-45% of its original level. They also said the situation is improving as dealers have begun moving to digital payments.Still, volume growth is expected to be under pressure for two quarters. Some brokerages have trimmed their earnings estimates of paint companies factoring in lower volumes. We have cut earnings for Asian Paints higher than for most consumer companies, said a Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd report.That makes for a sobering outlook even as there is uncertainty on whether oil prices can go up further. Though demonetization is not a structural issue, it has jolted demand, and it is difficult to judge how soon consumption will recover to normal levels. Thus, paint stocks could remain under pressure till signs of a recovery come in sight.",2016-12-16,eeRiGizOwQ0ayyGOy6MUCL,"If the liquidity crunch following demonetisation is affecting volumes, higher costs in wake of Opec oil production cuts can affect margins if companies decide to absorb the cost ",competitor,07:48,Paints: not a pretty picture 
0.07,"Chatbots turn specialists
				   
				 When people react to news about chatbots, it has more to do with what they can potentially do sometime in the future, than what they probably experienced with an existing one. The experience would go back a long way. Eliza, a chatbot created in the 1960s, has given endless entertainment to generations of coders during their breaks. In its early days, Yahoo Messenger came with a chatbot. These experiments revealed something about human fascination with machines that can mimic humans. They underscore why the format will work. In the media sector, the Quartz app and The New York Times Facebook Messenger have adopted this format. They have a great user interface, and give the users a distinct feel of chat.But the real disruption is happening at the back-end. If phase one of this change happened through intelligent personal assistants such as Apples Siri, Microsofts Cortana, Amazons Alexa or Google Assistant, phase two is where these assistants become specialists. Bank of America (BoA) announced the launch of its chatbot Erica, which will sit in BoAs mobile app, analyse customers financial data and give recommendations. Similarly, Mastercard announced a chatbot that will work on Facebook Messenger to help solve customers problems. IBM has joined hands with Slack Technologies to make its slackbot more intelligent and be able to help a companys tech department. IBMs computer system Watson will do a good part of data crunching.Watson, which became a part of public conversation a few years ago after winning TV game show Jeopardy, is already crunching data in other verticals. One of the most useful areas it is looking at is oncology, to help doctors treat cancer more effectively.There has long been a debate on whats better, being a generalist or being a specialist. At one point, it seemed that a good personal assistant would be both, a generalist and a specialist. But it looks like that division will persist. But all of them will still fit into our pocket.Economist and professor Pankaj Ghemawat, in his thought-provoking book World 3.0: Global Prosperity, How To Achieve It, pointed to the fact that the world is not flat. Despite all the advances in communication technology, trade and transportation, things tend to stay within the borders. Views on privacy is one such. Recently Alibabas founder Jack Ma urged China to use big data to combat crime. The example he gave included a person using e-payments to travel in 50 different buses in a single day (a potential pickpocket), and a person who orders a pressure cooker, a clock, steel ballsall at the same time (a potential bomb maker). His remarks made several Western observers, especially privacy advocates, cringe. Its not clear how the Chinese took to his remarks. This came at a time when China is reported to be launching a social credit system.Meanwhile, regulators in the West are tightening the screws on how companies can share their data. The US Federal Communications Commission approved new rules that prevent broadband providers from collecting data about their customers. Article 29 Working Party, the European data protection supervisor, has questioned the recent changes in WhatsApps privacy policy, in which it said it would share data with its parent company Facebook. There is tremendous pressure from civil society as well. For example, Reuters reported that Digital Rights Ireland, a privacy advocate, has challenged an EU-US commercial data transfer pact saying it doesnt have enough privacy protection. While the US has traditionally dealt with the privacy question by strengthening its technology (the Apple-FBI fight is an example), Europe preferred the legal route.Both come with the risk of loopholes, and those in charge of data havent shown much enthusiasm when breaches happen. The disclosure of Yahoo accounts getting hacked came years after it happened. These risks will only go up as the world gets more digital. Recently, researchers from three universitiesthe Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU), the Singapore University of Technology and Design and the University of South Alabamacame together to demonstrate that its possible to hack a 3D printer to make invisible changes to the design. Life is convenient in a digital world, but there are also security and privacy risks. How we balance the two will be one of the biggest challenges in the coming years.There is only one difference between a bad economist and a good one, economist Frederic Bastiat wrote in his famous essay, That Which Is Seen and That Which Is Not Seen: The bad economist confines himself to the visible effect; the good economist takes into account both the effect that can be seen and those effects that must be foreseen. He might have added to that list, the back-end. Its definitely true of cryptocurrencies. A lot of attention has gone towards bitcoins, the rise and fall in the price of the currency, and trying to figure out who created it. Meanwhile, whats turning out to be disruptive is its back-end, blockchain, the automated open public ledger. Its finding new applications, and helping in removing inefficiencies.Cross-border trade is one example. It involves multiple time zones, and multiple payment processing, resulting in delays. Recently, two banks, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Wells Fargo, processed a cross-border trade of cotton from the US to China for an Australian trader using blockchain technology. Mortgage is another. Bank of China and HSBC recently announced that they will use it to speed up home loan processing in Hong Kong.Its not restricted to the finance sector. Disney recently revealed that it was working on its own blockchain called Dragonchain. Its not clear how the entertainment major will use it, even though blockchain fans have been speculating on applications ranging from a new currency that visitors will spend in its theme parks to a points system for different games.

-0.83,"Bengaluru: Bhaskar Bhat, 62, has been at the helm of Tata group firm Titan Co. Ltd for nearly 15 years. His association with the Tata Watch Project, which eventually led to the creation of Titan, has continued for more than three decades, during which he has seen the Titan brand expand from watches into jewellery, eyewear and precision engineering.
				   
				About four months ago, Titan entered yet another categorytraditional womens wearas part of a pilot project, while watches and jewellery continue to be its mainstay, accounting for a major portion of its revenue. Unlike the jewellers in the unorganized sector who have been hit by demonetization, Titan expects the governments move to help boost its sales in the longer run. The company estimates it has less than 5% market share in jewellery and therefore abundant headroom for growth.As of now there are no acquisition plans in the pipeline, says Bhat, and the companys focus is on integrating brands such as CaratLane in jewellery and Favre-Leuba in watches and Maison Montblancwhich makes jewellery, writing instruments and leather goodsas all these were acquired less than two years ago. In an interview, Bhat spoke about the companys key business segments and the fillip it expects from demonetization. Edited excerpts:How has this fiscal year shaped up so far and what kind of growth rate do you expect over the next two years?Overall, like we reported, we had been growing in the first six months, by a small amount, but still, growth was there. In fact, we even said that were expecting a 15% growth in the jewellery business and we expect to clock those numbers. In watches also, the growth rates are better than last year. So the year as such is better, that much I can say. We will be able to keep our current rate of growth, i.e. 15%. Whether it will be much more for FY18 and the year after, we cannot say. But for us FY18 will be better than the current year primarily because demonetization has, in a way, sucked the winds out of the sails of the unorganized sector. Do you expect any fallout from demonetization on Titans future performance? Right now I can confidently say that the concerns because of demonetizationfor instance, concerns that there is no cash for daily transactions so I wont buy watcheshas diminished considerably. It was an event that has affected most companies and we have also articulated that we did get affected in the first week to 10 days. After that, normalcy has come back; the informal (unorganized) economy was affected whereas it has not affected us. In the end, consumers have to buy jewellery, watches and eyewear. If the unorganized sector is not able to give them the product, theyll have to come to us, right?Companies that were doing business in black will not be able to transform to our kind of model or any other kind of model where you accept credit cards and cheques, you keep your books of accounts and you pay taxes. Thats not a transition which will occur easily. And that is where the demand which is there, fundamentally, will flow to companies that can and have been operating legitimately.Youve said in the past that the jewellery industry will be full of turmoil due to policy changes. Is that still your expectation, in particular for this year? Over the past two years, there has been considerable turmoil in the jewellery industry. Gold-on-lease was stopped and later restored, customs duty was increased from 6% to 10%. Then excise duty was introduced and, if you remember, stores were closed for 43 days. Disclosing PAN cards was introduced for purchases above Rs5 lakh and then further dropped to those over Rs 2 lakh. And then we had demonetization. But I think jewellers have now learnt a lesson. At what rate the government decides to impose GST (goods and services tax) is the only other policy change in store and that will benefit us because a lot of the jewellers will have to fall in linedemonetization plus GST is a nightmare for them. So we should benefit from FY18 onward.Which of your jewellery brands are you betting big on and do you expect sales from your Golden Harvest Scheme (GHS) to get a significant boost going ahead?There is a lot of excitement in CaratLane, which we acquired, and Mia. Both are appealing to younger consumers. But between Tanishq, Mia, Zoya, CaratLaneTanishq is certainly the biggest brand. It is a very steady high-growth brand and is at a very high level of sales. Sales from GHS are basically advance booking orders; so youve got a guarantee that one year later at least this much business you will do. Its always been 15-20% of our sales. We aggressively push GHS. Maybe its contribution to sales can increase a little more but I dont see it becoming the new normal.Watches and eyewear have not been doing too well. Whats the plan to boost sales? Watches are bought today as an accessory, not as a time-keeping device. So the strategy is clearly accessorization and premiumization. Getting into the smartwatch segment is also a strategy that weve introduced and were doing well at it. Eyewear has been slow this year, yes. Right now the effort is in ensuring existing stores grow rather than new stores. Growth will come out of the so-called same-store sales growth mantra. Is Titan planning to enter any new categories? We began piloting traditional womens wear in October and are looking at opening a physical store. And we still have to grow perfumes, for example, which is still at a level of Rs30-40 crore. So we dont have any other category in the pipeline. What is your strategy when it comes to competing with online marketplaces? We participate, we dont compete. In watches, we are with online marketplaces like Flipkart and Myntra, and we have a strict contractual obligation with them as to what price they can sell our products at. Discounting is at our behest, not theirs and they have agreed to this so theyve become a partner. The biggest advantage we have is we have offline stores. Our strategy has always been omnichannel but there are very big advantages of bricks and mortar, which I think bricks-and-mortar companies need to play up and not just assume that everybody is going to migrate to online. The need to go to a store is least in watches, because watches you can buy online also, and highest in jewellery. The higher the ticket size, the more risk-averse people will get. So convenience is not everything when you are buying. And I think this trend of buying eyewear online is a passing phase. People will realize that unless you get the quality that you want, it can be quite bad. If your lens is not good enough, for example, its a risk. You also cant touch and feel your frame (before placing an order online). Youve been associated with Titan, and earlier the Tata Watch Project for about three decades. What would you say is the one significant event in the history of the company? We didnt know a thing about retail. So the first retail store we opened in Safina Plaza (a shopping complex in central Bengaluru) in the late 1980s was very memorable. It was a 350-square-foot store but it was very well designed. I remember we sold 17 watches on the first day and we were very thrilled! That was a significant event in the life of Titanthe introduction of retailing.When you look back, I dont think we ever dreamt that we would be a watches, and jewellery, and eyewear, and precision engineering company. It was inconceivable. We were just about relieved that wed got government approval to get into the watch industry and that we were able to make good watches and overtake HMT in five-six years. After that, its been kind of a dream run.",2017-02-04,eokVM94g0SpP1h72Lt1VFO,Titan MD Bhaskar Bhat on integrating brands such as CaratLane  and why he expects the jewellery business to get a boost from demonetisation,competitor,00:41,"Titan will maintain current growth rate over two years, says Bhaskar Bhat"

				The move assumes significance as the government post demonetisation has been encouraging people to shift to a cash-less or less-cash regime and use digital mode for transactions. HDFC Bank has decided to steeply raise the charges on certain transactions, capping cash component in others and also introducing charges on certain transactions from 1 March, a bank official told PTI on Friday.ALSO READ: RBI to soon put new Rs100 notes in circulationThe city-headquartered bank has capped the third-party transactions at Rs25,000 a day, reduced the number of free cash transactions at branches to four from five earlier and also raised the fee for non-free transactions by a steep 50% to Rs150, it said on its website. Earlier, it used to allow Rs50,000 cash transactions, both withdrawals and deposits per day, the official said, adding the review is only for salary and savings accounts. The bank has also capped the free cash transactions at home branches, including deposits and withdrawals at branches at Rs2 lakh, above which customers will have to pay a minimum of Rs150 or Rs5 per thousand. For non-home branches, the free transactions are only Rs25,000 after which fees set in at the same level, he said. It can be noted that a slower-than-expected fee income growth was one of the reasons which led the bank report its slowest quarterly profit growth in the past 18 years in the just concluded December quarter, when its bottomline growth slipped to 15%, as a slew of charges were discontinued during the note ban. The bank official said the review has been done to discourage usage of cash and push digital transactions, which have grown at a higher pace.

-0.86,"Mumbai: Indian pharmaceutical companies are on the cusp of a transformation from being generic drug makers to creating a pipeline of complex generics, speciality and innovative products through enhanced focus on research and development (R&D). Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltds growth strategy also revolves around making this transition. In fact, it is among the few Indian firms that started investing in new drug development way back in the year 2000. But unlike most of its peers that are continuously exploring opportunities for acquisitions to propel growth, Glenmark believes in growing organically by leveraging the strong product pipeline it has built over the years through indigenous research. In an interview, Glenn Saldanha, chairman and managing director of the Mumbai-based company, shares his vision of how he plans to grow the business in a challenging environment. Edited excerpts:
				   
				Glenmark has maintained that it wants to grow the business organically. Why so, especially when we are seeing consolidation in the pharmaceutical sector globally? There are different approaches to building this business. Our approach is that we have a very good pipeline of products launching in the market over the next three to five years. So we feel comfortable that the underlining business will grow at about 15-20% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) on a five-year basis. We have always believed that the transformational step for Glenmark would be when we launch something innovative. So, we are right now putting our capital into research to drive the next levers of growth. Our peers, on the other hand, are looking at acquisitions either of companies or products. When you go out to acquire a product, you are competing with big firms like a Pfizer or a Merck. Why would someone give you the product when these players have much bigger marketing muscle and deeper resources? So, it is very hard to follow the in-licensing strategy for novel products. Thats the reason why we took the build-out route and we have been working on innovation for the last 16 years. Our goal is to do cutting-edge innovation and eventually out-license the product. Do you plan to out-license all your innovative products or will you pursue development and commercialization for some drugs entirely on your own?We are open to out-licensing our entire pipeline at this point of time. For the products which are in our core therapeutic areas of oncology, dermatology and respiratory, we are trying to look at joint development or trying to hold on to rights to certain markets, either exclusive or semi-exclusive rights, where we will build our own commercial front-end and use that to market these products. For products which are not in our core therapeutic areas, like pain for instance, we will out-license the product for worldwide rights and give the entire thing away to the partner. So, I think its a different deal structure that we are looking at for different opportunities. ALSO READ: Glenmark Pharma seeks to dig deep for future growthThe company expects complex generics, speciality and innovative drugs to drive growth in the next decade. What are the risks and challenges in achieving these goals?In the next four-five years, we have good visibility for our generic business, that it will grow at 15-20%, but we feel that the generic business will slow down thereafter and we will replace it with our innovative and speciality products. The path to innovation is much riskier when compared to a pure generic business but we will keep our R&D spend at 11% of sales, net of out-licensing income. That will enable us to strengthen our operational cash flow and balance sheet. We have chosen this path of innovation which is difficult but we have built our expertise and capabilities in this area. The company currently has seven novel drugs and six speciality drugs under development and these products are expected to contribute 30% to total sales by 2025.What are the plans for in-licensing of drugs?We dont do in-licensing of novel products. Our in-licensing is only on the generic side. The in-licensing happens for products for which we do not have capability internally. We have 15 in-licensing deals either signed or in advanced stage discussions, which have a total addressable market size of $12 billion. Generic players are facing pricing pressure in the US. In such an environment, what will be the growth drivers for Glenmark until the speciality and innovative products are launched in the US?We file about 20 abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) a year in the US. We have some pretty exciting products which will get approved between FY17 and FY19. In the short run we have a generic of Zetia, which will cover us for the next six months. We expect to garner $200 million-$250 million from sales of the Zetia generic during the exclusivity period. I think the pipeline looks very strong to tide over the near term. What is your strategy for emerging markets? Are you looking to expand manufacturing capabilities in these markets?Emerging markets will continue to account for about 20% of sales and wont grow beyond that in the next few years because the US contribution is growing. On the manufacturing side, there is a possibility that at some point we may put up a facility in Russia. We still dont know. It could be organic or it could be a small acquisition of a facility.

Theyre also hard to catch, working in remote areas and sometimes getting help from corrupt officials.What happens in most of the cases is that when we reach those areas, people get a whiff of it and they run away, they remove their workers, they remove everything, said Piyush Sharma, technical secretary at Indian bureau of mines in Nagpur. Drones will be effective in a way that we will have pictures, which can be used as evidence.Rogue miners have gotten so bad that the government in 2012 shut down all iron ore pits in a western state that was the source of half Indias exports of the mineral. A judicial panel estimated illegal operators in Goa had siphoned off Rs34,940 crore ($5 billion) of ore while dumping toxic waste in rivers and farmland and destroying forest habitat. The ban turned the country from the worlds third-largest exporter of iron ore to a net importer.One of the biggest mineral thefts is sand dredged from ocean beaches and river beds. Unlicensed extraction has caused flooding and threatened marine life like the endangered Gangetic dolphin. But demand for it as a building material in cement and concrete has soared with the expanding economy. In the year that starts 1 April, the government plans to spend $59 billion to modernize railways, airports and roads. It also plans to build 10 million homes for the poor by 2019 and provide electricity to about 240 million people who dont have it.Bureaucratic barriersSand thieves arent the only problem. As growth in Asias second-largest economy fueled a surge in demand for imported raw materials, theres been a lack of investment in domestic mineral reserves. Excessive delays in getting permits led foreign companies like Rio Tinto Group and South Koreas Posco to withdraw huge projects in frustration, and Bangalore-based Deccan Gold Mines Ltd. hasnt mined a single ounce of the metal after 13 years of trying.Using unmanned aerial surveillance of mines can help restore confidence in the governments ability to protect mineral rights and control activity, according to Balvider Kumar, Indias secretary of mines. In addition to tracking the illegal miners and their trucks, the government will have another tool in helping to monitor authorized operations, determine lease boundaries and aid in exploration.In some of the states, illegal mining is a matter of concern as it is taking place on a very massive scale, Kumar said by telephone from New Delhi. Drones can help us find out how much material has been mined by a company and whether correct royalties or taxes have been paid to the government.Thats a big improvement to the current system for monitoring mines and tracking cheats that relies on local complaints and unconfirmed reports, with few ways for the government to follow up to see if action was taken, according to the ministry. The government also began a mining surveillance program in October that employs satellite and remote-sensing technology to help curb illegal activities, according to the Indian Bureau of Mines.Flying eyesEarlier this month, Tata Steel Ltd.s Noamundi iron ore mine became the first in the country to use drone technology on an area spread over 1,160 hectares (2,866 acres) in the state of Jharkhand.State-run exploration agencies and the Indian Institute of Technology are studying drone use over river beds to identify potential trouble spots. Companies also can use thermal cameras in the drones to monitor mines at night, and the technology can provide images that make it easier to map exploration areas that might otherwise take months to complete on foot.The surveillance upgrade is just part of Indias bid to encourage more mineral investment. In 2015,  Prime Minister Narendra Modi decided to switch to competitive auctions for allocating resource rights, after years of discretionary or free allotments led to bruising corruption scandals. While most companies dont like having to re-bid on deposits they find, the government says it wants a more transparent model. The process for getting licences also was simplified.Luring investmentThose are the kinds of changes that Piyush Goyal, who helped to revive the countrys coal production, expects will lure more legal investments in domestic mineral extraction. Goyal, who is the minister of state with independent charge of power, coal, new and renewable energy and mines, predicts spending will surge more than sevenfold to 1 trillion rupees over five years, doubling mine output and reducing dependence on foreign raw materials.India imports almost all of the copper concentrate it uses and is one of the worlds biggest buyers of steel, aluminum, iron ore, gold and coal, mines ministry data show. But the country has yet to fully tap mineral riches that the government estimates are on par with those of major exporters like Canada, Australia, Brazil, South Africa, Chile and Mexico, according to the Central Statistical Organization.Many of those countries are already using drone technology, as are other industries. Indonesia used them at tin mines and to track production at oil-palm and rubber plantations. China employs drones to monitor pollution, while some farmers use them to spread herbicides and photograph plants, according to the digital association Bitkom.Drones are being recognized as the technology of the future, said Sharma, the technical secretary at the Indian bureau of mines.Bloomberg",2017-02-02,fy5nTXrGWaQIIshcdz8jvL,The government will deploy flying camera drones to track renegades who for years have been extracting everything from sand to coal to iron ore without permits,both,15:15,Catching illegal sand men is key to make mining pay off in India 
-0.48,"Company after company is reporting slowing sales growth. Take Godrej Consumer Products Ltd. In the June quarter, its soap sales volume rose by a figure that was early double-digits, it said, without giving a number. But deflation meant that sales by value rose by only 1%. Even if we assume volume growth at 10% or 11%, thats a significant cut.
				   
				The reason for this is the company gave volume discounts, not only to pass on the benefit of lower material costs, but also protect share and match the aggression shown by market leader Hindustan Unilever Ltd. In household insecticides, its sales was hit by a delayed monsoon (in June), which led to an 11% decline in sales. But this should be a timing issue and sales should improve in the current quarter.Overall, on a constant currency and organic growth basis, Godrej Consumers net sales growth was flat in India and rose by 6% internationally, leading to a 3% overall sales growth. Organic growth is calculated by excluding the sales of acquired/disposed businesses. The acquisition of Strength of Nature in Africa saw the regions sales rise by 52% and, along with higher growth in Latin America, was the chief reason for higher international sales growth of 18% (constant currency, but including the impact of acquisitions). Main market Indonesia has seen slower growth of 3%.Overall, Godrej Consumers sales rose by 6.8% from a year ago, growing slightly ahead of the 6.7% increase in material costs. While the increase in employee costs and other expenses were restrained to 3.9% and 2.4%, respectively, advertising and publicity costs declined by 4.8%. A higher increase in promotionsmore volumes for the same price, for instancecontributed to this. Under the new accounting standards, such promotions have to be deducted from sales.Total costs rose by only 4.2% as a result and its operating profit margin rose by 2 percentage points from a year ago. That then is the silver lining. As long as margins are stable or improving, companies can play the waiting game. Its profit before tax rose by 17.5% while exceptional items buoyed its net profit, which should be ignored.If the decline in sales was only due to lower input costs resulting in lower product prices, then it should not matter. Real sales growth will still be high. What is worrying is that companies are saying that demand is weak, especially in rural areas. What has held up investor hopes is that urban demand should revive, and then, there are magic pills such as a good monsoon, the hike in government salaries and the proposed goods and services tax.Godrej Consumers shares fell by 2.7% after its results were declared on Friday. That is nothing considering that its share has been steadily rising since end-January and is up by around 40%. The factors holding down its performance are mostly to be found in the external environment.

-0.25,"BPL was the brand of choice in TVs and other large appliances for many urban Indians in the 1990s and early 2000s. The company lost its way and shut its appliances business in the late 2000s. Last year, after the brand showed high recall in some consumer surveys, BPL executive chairman and managing director Ajit Nambiar decided to explore a relaunch. A few months later, BPL relaunched on Flipkart. Customer response has exceeded Nambiars expectations. In an interview, he spoke about sales targets, financing options and selling online. Edited excerpts: 
Why did you choose Flipkart for the relaunch?Other than the fact that Flipkart is by far the leader in this category, what brought us to Flipkart was that if you have a good product it needs to be sold well, installed well and serviced post-sale as well. We also spoke to Amazon and Snapdeal but the only guys who have that end-to-end infrastructure were Flipkart with Jeeves (after-sales services provider) and Ekart (courier service). Online, its all about customer reviews and we didnt want to have bad reviews because of service issues. Flipkart also has a lot of data on buying behaviour, who the customer is. That was very valuable. We started making our marketing strategy based on this kind of data. We started making our marketing strategy based on this kind of data. It also helps that the Jeeves guys are former BPL executives so it helped us (getting a sense of comfort with Flipkart).What are your sales targets?We should be able to do Rs70-80 crore for this year (ending March 2017). In three years time, weve set a target of Rs600 crore as we add more appliances.What are the  other categories in which you are launching products?We have TVs and washing machines. We are adding large-screen TVs (50- inch TVs and larger) and smart TVs. We will get into refrigerators and microwaves within the next six months. We are also working on ACs and small appliances but it will take us slightly longer to launch those.You currently outsource assembly. Will you get into assembly of parts or manufacturing? The critical components are decided by us. Where we assemble is based on what incentives state governments give. Most of the components in this industry are not made in India. We have a long way to go before that. In case of BPL, earlier we used to manufacture components. Now, its much easier to find parts. This frees you up to focus on design and marketing, and allows us to keep costs low.But we will soon do assembly  sourcing of products and putting them together. It makes sense to assemble if we are doing 40,000-50,000 units a month. For manufacturing, maybe one million a month! Currently, we are doing around 5,000-7,000 units a month.Has it been tough to raise capital? How much have you raised?Weve been able to raise working capital as per our operating plan. It has not been an issue. Banks are aware that we are serious about this business, so weve been able to raise working capital. Apart from that we will invest Rs40-50 crore to enhance our technology.Any plans to raise equity financing?No, not night now. Its too early.Will you be exclusive to Flipkart for long?Right now, they are the best channel in this category. Right now, we are happy with the progress.

-0.58,"This weeks acrimonious separation between the chairman of Tata Group and its majority owners may now be heading for a divorce. Ratan Tata, who returned to head the conglomerate after ousting Cyrus Pallonji Mistry, is looking for a partner to buy the ex-chairmans stake, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.
				   
				Should Mistry agree to sell, how much can he hope to get for his familys 18.4% of Tata Sons Ltd?Bear in mind that following his dismissal, Mistry raised some very serious allegations about both the holding company and several of its biggest publicly traded units. In hitting back at the board that fired him, Mistry said the groups net worth of $26 billion could be impaired by as much as $18 billionshrinking to just $8 billionshould writedowns be needed at businesses like Tata Steel Ltds European operations; Tata Motors Ltds passenger car business (ex-Jaguar Land Rover, the jewel in the empires crown); Indian Hotels Co.s overseas Taj properties; one of Tata Power Ltd.s plants; and a floundering wireless telecom venture with NTT Docomo Inc.As a seller, Mistry is unlikely to behave anything like a spurned chairman trying to score debating points. To maximize value, he might say he overestimated the risk of Armageddon. He might even admit the possibility that Ratan Tatas return to a conglomerate he chaired for two decades will reinvigorate the operating companies. Maybe Tata cant repeat a near sevenfold increase in book value over the period 2004-2012, but if global steel demand stabilizes, theres a fair chance the groups assets could reach a book value of $28 billion after a year. In the base-case scenario, the coffee-to-cars-to-software conglomerate wont be any worse off, and its assets would be worth in 2017 what they are today: $26 billion.Now suppose that status quo has a likelihood of 50%, while the probability of a massive writedown is 20%, and that of an improvement is 30%. That gives a one-year-forward book value of $23 billion. Considering that General Electric Co. trades at three times its estimated book value for next year, and companies in the more diversified Tata Group sell at 4.8 times, Mistry could perhaps ask for a halfway-house multiple of 3.75 times, valuing his 18.4% stake at a little under $16 billion.Only a patient investor who cares more about growth than current income would be willing to write that check. After all, the dividend received from operating companies yielded just 1.6% on Tata Sons investment last year, according to the Economic Times. An investor who paid a multiple of 3.75 to relieve Mistry of his stake would earn a divided yield of 0.4%.As for Mistry himself, at $16 billion, he would walk away with an annualized 4.5% return on the $200 million loan the Tata family took from outsiders 91 years ago. Include past dividends, and he might even have matched or beaten the 9% annual return from the US stock market since 1928. Thats hardly a divorce to feel unhappy about.

				Boeing chief executive officer Dennis Muilenburg sketched out a Jetsons-like future at a conference Tuesday, envisioning a commercial space-travel market with dozens of destinations orbiting the Earth and hypersonic aircraft shuttling travelers between continents in two hours or less. And Boeing intends to be a key player in the initial push to send humans to Mars, maybe even beating Musk to his long-time goal.Im convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket, Muilenburg said at the Chicago event on innovation, which was sponsored by the Atlantic magazine.Like Musks SpaceX, Boeing is focused on building out the commercial space sector near earth as spaceflight becomes more routine, while developing technology to venture far beyond the moon. The Chicago-based aerospace giant is working with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to develop a heavy-lift rocket called the Space Launch System for deep space exploration. Boeing and SpaceX are also the first commercial companies Nasa selected to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station.Mars transportMusk last week welcomed competitors as he unveiled a SpaceX craft that would dwarf the workhorse of Apollo missions of a half-century ago, hauling 100 travelers to Mars with cruise-ship-style amenities.The goal of SpaceX really is to build the transport system.

Nowadays, Muilenburg sees space tourism closer to home blossoming over the next couple of decades into a viable commercial market. The International Space Station could be joined in low-earth orbit by dozens of hotels and companies pursuing micro-gravity manufacturing and research, he said.I think its a fascinating area for us, he said.Muilenburg said Boeing will make spacecraft for the new era of tourists.

-0.35,"San Francisco: Apple Inc. attracted a swathe of new iPhone customers over the holiday period, auguring well for a more significant upgrade to its flagship product this year  and the services revenue that these devices are increasingly generating.
				   
				Existing iPhone users upgraded to the latest iPhone 7 models at about the same rate as the iPhone 6S a year earlier, chief executive officer Tim Cook said in a conference call with analysts. Yet Apple still managed to sell 3.5 million more phones in the three months ended 31 December, indicating growth was driven by new customers.The iPhone 7 represented a modest update to its predecessor, the 6S, adding water resistance, an improved camera, battery life and processor while retaining similar styling. Expectations are mounting for a more significant upgrade to Apples flagship product later this year, which is the 10th anniversary of the iPhones launch. That may persuade more existing iPhone users to open their wallets for the next model.When were able to innovate with new generations of products, clearly that plays a role in the upgrade rate, chief financial officer Luca Maestri said.Apple reported total revenue rose 3.3% to $78.4 billion, with earnings of $3.36 a share, in the holiday quarter, exceeding analyst forecasts. The shares gained as much as 4% in early trading on Wednesday after the results.Samsung Electronics Co. recalled its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone in September after a fault that caused some batteries to burst into flames. That reduced competition in the market for large, high-end smartphones and likely helped attract new customers, according to New York-based BTIG analyst Walt Piecyk.Once they get you in their ecosystem, theyve got a far better shot at getting you to buy another one of their phones, Piecyk said. If anything, the fact that it wasnt stickiness and services and upgrades makes you feel better about future growth.Americans are taking longer to upgrade their smartphones, partly because wireless carriers have phased out plans that offer discounts for new devices every two years. That puts more pressure on handset makers to find new customers  something Apple pulled off in late 2016.Last year, Apple suffered a rare year-over-year revenue decline, as iPhone sales tumbled, particularly in China, where competitors such as Oppo and Vivo introduced cheaper phones with similar performance. In the first fiscal quarter, sales in mainland China grew, excluding the effect of a strong US dollar, Cook said.Cooks response to last years sales decline was to push more services, such as Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud. These businesses are more profitable than iPhones and iPads, and they increase the chances customers will buy future Apple gadgets because users apps and data are tightly woven into the companys operating systems.Services revenue grew 18% to $7.2 billion in the most recent period. Apple said it aims to double the annual total to more than $50 billion by fiscal 2021.The App Store is going to be a significant driver of growth, CFO Maestri said. A lot of it comes from the fact that our installed base of devices around the world continues to grow very well. BloombergAlex Webb",2017-02-01,h7rcCJ9rCXZLik6cpynrBK,Existing iPhone users upgraded to the latest iPhone 7 models at about the same rate as the iPhone 6S a year earlier,competitor,21:07,Apple woos new iPhone fans as current owners await upgrade

Revenue rose 16.8% to Rs5,158.42 crore from Rs4,481.20 crore in the year-ago period as the company added planes and operated more flights. IndiGo controls about 39% share of the domestic market, with 126 planes and 854 daily flights. In an analyst call on Tuesday, IndiGo said its yields or airfares were down 10% in October, 20% in November, 17% in December and 10% in January year-on-year. IndiGo president Aditya Ghosh said the airline will continue to match the fares of rival airlines in each fare bucket in the coming months as wella strategy started in the second half of last year. We have the lowest cost structure, Ghosh said.During the quarter, 71.7% of IndiGo flights were on time. The airline said its operational performance was impacted primarily due to adverse weather conditions, air traffic congestion at key airports and operational issues associated with its A320neo planes.IndiGo has bet big on the A320neos Pratt & Whitney engine. The new engine has been throwing up challenges including startup issues and erroneous technical messages to the pilot since last year when some of the planes were inducted after a long delay. Some other issues are also being fixed, IndiGo said on Tuesday.There are certain issues with combustor chamber lining as a result of which we are not getting the engine life that we would have expected, Ghosh said, adding There is a redesign that Pratt is implementing to fix this. It has also talked about an issue with the oil seal that have seen some failures. Pratt is working on it. He said the delayed delivery of fan blades for the neo engines is also being addressed. The engine is giving 15% fuel savings compared with 14% earlier, he added.The airline expects to end fiscal year 2017 with a fleet of 133 planes and may induct more next fiscal than initially expected, it said.Consulting firm CAPA said IndiGos net profit per passenger dropped 47.5% to Rs430 in the December quarter from Rs820 a year earlier and predicted challenges to profitability next fiscal.Industry will add 60-65 aircraft in FY18 which will increase supply dynamics significantly and with cost creep of over 10% likely, see emerging profitability challenges, CAPA said.

0.01,"Bengaluru: Tata Group chairman Cyrus Mistry has a new worry in the growing pile of troubles afflicting Indias largest conglomerate. How to revive growth at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), which accounts for 16% of the groups $103.5 billion revenue?
				   
				The troubles at Tata Motors Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd are well-documented. Despite TCS reporting a 3.7% sequential dollar revenue growth in the April-June period, the company is likely to report weak numbers in the second quarter, results of which will be declared on 13 October.Worryingly for investors, TCS now risks growing at a slower clip this year than last year, when its revenue expanded 7.1%, the slowest annual growth at TCS since 2009, when Natarajan Chandrasekaran took charge as its chief executive. TCS is expected to report an at-best 1.6% sequential dollar growth in the second quarter, according to brokerage BNP Paribas. This, on the back of 3.7% growth in the first quarter, translates into TCS doing $8.79 billion business in the first six months of the current financial year. TCS now needs more than $8.92 billion in revenue in second half of the year if it intends to grow at 7.1% this year. Simply put, TCS will need to record a better show in the October-March period this year than in the second half of last year. This certainly is a tall task as technology outsourcing firms report soft growth in the second half of the financial year.Undoubtedly, Chandrasekaran faces a tough task given the size of TCS.At the heart of TCSs slow growth is its inability to build a stronger consulting practice and reluctance to buy small firms for technologies like design consulting and automation platform providers. These tiny buyouts not just improve the current solution deliveries but also bring in growth. May be now, Mistry could nudge Chandrasekaran to start buying.With this as a backdrop, Mint puts the spotlight on five things to watch in TCSs second quarter earnings on 13 October:1. Revenue growthBrokerage BNP Paribas expects TCSs dollar revenue to rise 1.6% to $4.43 billion in the July-September period on a sequential basis. This is a big worry as this will mean that TCS needs to put forward its best foot forward in the remaining six months of the year if it wants to save itself from the humiliation of recording an even slower growth than last year. Management commentary on demand levels from its customers in Europe, after Britain voted to leave the EU, will be crucial.2. Pressure on profitability poses a double whammySince January this year, TCSs operating margins have been under pressure. TCSs 26.1% Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin at the end of March quarter was 54 basis points less than margins at the end of October-December period last year. The companys margins further contracted to 25.1% at the end of March quarter, which the management claimed to be largely on account of annual wage hikes. Now, as commoditized deals come under further pricing pressure, and TCS continues to spend money in reskilling its workforce and building digital technologies, traditional levers like going slow on hiring, will not be enough to offset the gradual decline in profitability. Analysts say that TCS is unlikely to end the current financial year with its stated guidance of 26-28%.3. What really is the problem among TCSs BFSI clients in the US?On 7 September, TCS in a mid-quarter update, said that some holding back of discretionary spending particularly in the BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance clients) vertical in the United States had led to sequential loss of momentum at the company. Is this just an one-off development or does this suggest a structural malaise? We know all IT vendors are seeing less business from big banks as these banks are spending less in application development work. Homegrown technology vendors are further seeing erosion in current revenue from the embrace of automation platforms, which is cannibalizing the existing model of billing clients on human hours. 4. Rain check of weak sectors and geographiesTCS does not expect growth to rebound in Japan. The company claims to have arrested any loss of business from its UK-based insurance platform Diligenta. Growth from telecoms segment continue to be wobbly. Together, an underperformance from the three units eroded about 2% growth from the companys 11.9% growth on constant currency basis in 2015-16. TCS needs to report some growth on a consistent basis if it has to better last years growth.5. Is higher net erosion of existing business biting into TCSs growth?During the July-September period last year, TCS claimed its order book was the strongest ever, with about 30% more than the company ever managed in any quarter. The company, however, does not disclose its order book size. Outsourcing deals are long-term contracts, and IT vendors can generate only about 3-4% of revenue from new orders in the first year, according to JPMorgan Chases George. Agreed, IT firms lose about 3-5% of current business every year, which in TCSs case, translates into a loss of about $500-825 million a year. This clearly suggest that TCS is losing more business from existing clients because even some business generated from its record order book has not offset the annual loss of business, thereby resulting in a sluggish y-o-y growth.",2016-10-12,hesaBaeP0eIEHrwSnqJO5K,TC is likely to report weak numbers in the second quarter and risks growing at a slower clip this year than last year,both,01:16,TCS Q2 earnings: Five things to watch for today
-0.74,"New Delhi: The practice of forcing industries to cross-subsidize household consumers power tariffs is leading to an unprecedented shift among businesses towards captive solar power with some committing to go fully reliant on clean energy.
				   
				Cost of producing solar power, which was over Rs12 per kilowatt hour (unit) in 2010, has dropped sharply over the years. The latest auction, which was held in November, saw takers for solar power projects willing to sell power at Rs3 a unit. The fall in solar power generation cost has now made it attractive for businesses to go for captive solar power plants, including rooftop plants that supply power cheaper than from the grid, which is expensive on account of the cross-subsidy that industrial consumers are saddled with. Businesses, especially in the manufacturing sector, have long been complaining of high cost of power, exorbitant tax on diesel and escalating cost of capital as factors that render them less competitive in global markets where their peers enjoy low or negative cost of capital and in some cases, subsidies. Solar power is now available at Rs 4-4.5 a unit. In the future, it will cost much less because of technology improvement and possibly low cost of capital. In West Bengal, for instance, cost of power from the grid for industries ranges from Rs 6-8 per unit at present. In Maharashtra, it is Rs 6.5 a unit. Everywhere, except two or three states, tariffs are above Rs 5 a unit for industrial consumers. If you are able to get concessional finance from any multilateral agency and you can produce solar power at Rs 4 a unit consistently for 25 years, it can reduce cost of energy for the business and reduce carbon emissions, said Mahendra Singhi, chief executive officer, Dalmia Cements (Bharat) Ltd. Dalmia Cementss short term goal is to raise the share of clean energy in its total electricity consumption fourfold from 7% at present and to go fully reliant on clean energy in the long term. Multilateral agencies such as International Finance Corp. (IFC), the private investment arm of World Bank Group, US Exim Bank, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Japan International Cooperation Agency and Germanys KFW are bullish on Indias rapidly expanding renewable energy industry for investment opportunities. We already have $1 billion of investments in clean energy projects in India. We are open to scaling it up to $3-4 billion in coming years, said Shalabh Tandon, India lead, climate business & clean energy, IFC. IFC on Thursday announced an equity investment of $125 million in Hero Future Energies Private Ltd., a clean energy firm, for a minority stake. Tandon said that IFC does not invest in coal-based thermal power because of its commitment to climate change goals. Companies like Apple Inc., IKEA Group, Nokia Oyj, Infosys Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd are among those committed to becoming fully reliant on clean energy.The Economic Survey 2015-16 had suggested that the burden of subsidising poor consumers can shift from industrial consumers to rich individuals and that state electricity regulators should use income as a yardstick to fix the power tariff for individual consumers. The idea was to help businesses become more competitive. India has a target of putting in place 175 gigawatt (GW) of renewable power capacity by 2022, out of which 100 GW is to come from solar. At the moment, the country has about 8.7 GW of solar power capacity.One hurdle that companies face in going fully reliant on clean energy is that storage of energy is a costly proposition, which makes them rely on stable power from the grid for a significant part of their energy consumption when renewable energy is not available. Singhi of Dalmia Cements said that once power storage becomes a viable option, the company will be fully run on clean energy.",2017-01-06,hjuezPVDJdbEbipsCKavSN,The fall in solar power generation cost has now made it attractive for businesses to go for captive solar power plants,both,14:37,Cross-subsidy of power tariffs lure businesses to solar energy
-0.44,"Mahindra and Mahindra Ltds (M&Ms) December quarter performance has gone down well with investors. The diversified auto manufacturer, facing growth challenges in both farm equipment and auto segments, managed to sustain profitability on the back of decent sales growth. The stock therefore rose 5% on Monday but slipped a bit on Tuesday, even as it has outperformed the BSE Auto index in the last one year.
				   
				Fuelling growth were the nine new launches in the auto segment through fiscal year 2016 that pushed up sales by about 15% from a year ago. And the price hike helped to improve the average per vehicle revenue by about 4%. However, it was not so in the farm equipment segment, where volumes grew by only 5% year-on-year and the revenue per unit sold fell by 1.7%.True, a weak rabi crop after two consecutive weak monsoons has dried up demand for farm equipment. Yet, as the market leader in tractors, M&Ms market share rose by about 300 basis points to 43% during the quarter. Its small commercial vehicles did not do too well. A basis point is 0.01%.Put together, net revenue (M&M and Mahindra Vehicle Manufacturers Ltd) rose by 15%. But what enthused investors was the 250 basis points jump in operating margin, at a time when sales growth is not at its best. Analysts feel that one-offs impacted profitability. An Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd report says that provisioning in line with the new Bonus Act, value diminution of assets and revaluation of loans impacted profit margins for the quarter. Of course, the biggest relief was the lower raw material costs and efforts to trim vehicle inventory. But this is no reason for bullishness on the companys prospects. The forthcoming monsoon is critical in determining offtake of farm equipment and automobiles. M&Ms management has pulled down its guidance for the former in FY16 from 5% to 10% and this segment comprises a third of the consolidated revenue.That said, the year after may see a better growth rate given the low base, and support an expansion in valuation.

				The record low tariffs, which have fallen below Rs.5 per kilowatt hour (kWh) to Rs.4.34 per unit, are raising uncomfortable questions about profitability and business viability.According to research firm Mercom Capital Group, many projects which were won at low tariffs are awaiting financial closure.Most domestic banks are unwilling to fund them due to concerns over the internal rate of return, or IRR, Mercom says.Developers are hoping that EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) and interest costs will continue to fall, ensuring commercial viability. But if prices do not fall as expected, then the bids may run into trouble.Analysts who track the sector say intense competition has substantially lowered the project returns (IRRs), reducing the margin of safety.Strong competition has led to developers lowering target IRRs to meet their development commitments, but the margins remain sufficient to cover the limited risks, says Kameswara Rao, partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers Pvt. Ltd (PwC).But rating agency ICRA Ltds calculations show that if one considers the borrowing or the funding cost at around 11%, then the companies can find it difficult to generate double-digit returns (IRR).In ICRAs estimates, the project IRR for a solar PV (photovoltaic) project, with tariff at Rs.5/kWh, project cost at Rs.5.5 crore/MW, cost of debt funding at 11.5% over a tenure of 12 years, and PLF at 19%, would remain below 10%, with the cumulative average debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) at 1.09 times, ICRA said in a note. With a longer debt maturity of 18 years, the average DSCR would however improve to an estimated 1.19 times. Nevertheless, for a 1% drop in PLF and for a Rs.0.5 crore/MW increase in capital cost (in each individual scenario), the project cash flows would be adversely affected, with the average DSCR declining by an estimated 0.08 time. PLF is utilization level or the plant load factor.The developers and investors Mercom spoke to estimate an IRR of 13-15%. This is based on a lending rate of 10-12%. Rates abroad are lower. But if one considers hedging costs, the cost advantage will not be that high.According to Kameswara Rao of PwC, recent bids are won by credible companies that have arrangements with lenders and investors. So, they do not face financing challenges.Another industry observer agrees funding may not be a challenge. What will be a challenge, however, is costs and return ratios. According to this person, projects won below Rs.4.6 per unit will have thin margins and ensuring financial viability over two decades will be a major challenge.Of course, none of these people are questioning the tariff trajectory.

0.92,"The flock of frightened pigeons that calls itself Indias telecom industry had a violent reaction recently when their regulator set a cat among them.
				   
				The impending entry of a new fourth-generation operator would anyway mean a trip to the slaughterhouse for a few of the dozen existing players, some of whom are already making a run for the coop door. But thats a known risk. Its the threat of having to cede market share to billionaire Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Jio faster than imagined thats causing nervousness.That latter possibility has been raised by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of Indias (Trai) consultation paper on scrapping the compensation one wireless service receives for calls routed to it by another.That proposal to do away with the calling-party-pays system, the incumbents allege, smacks of bias. It would give a pricing advantage to a new network like Jio, which would be more likely to originate calls than terminate them. Meanwhile, Jio has complained that existing operators are sabotaging its ongoing beta trials by not offering adequate interconnection, leading to call drops.Incumbents have denied the allegation, and accused Ambani of running a service in the garb of testing. The dispute is fast turning into just the kind of melee the government, looking to hold its biggest-ever auction of spectrum a little more than a month from now, can ill afford.Also Read: Reliance Jio vs the rest: Trai, PMO dragged into the fightTo the extent the fracas is the harbinger of a bruising price war, its also bad news for shareholders of Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular, which together with Vodafone control more than three-fifths of the market. The quest to expand data usage on their networks ahead of Jios long-delayed entry has already caused prices to head south:While data usage is indeed picking up, capital expenditure is accelerating. Ideas net debt is almost 5.7 times annual earnings before interest and taxes (Ebit); its 3.3 times Ebit for Bharti. With Reliance boasting to the regulator that its $20 billion investment in Jio is already more than any of its competitors, incumbents have little breathing room.When Kumar Mangalam Birla, Idea Cellulars controlling shareholder, sought to streamline his fiber-to-finance empire, minority shareholders balked at the prospect of being asked to fund his money-guzzling telecom venture. Ambani, on the other hand, has been lucky. His petroleum-refining business is minting cash, so creditors are giving him the chips to spin the roulette wheel and grab those 100 million Reliance Jio subscribers he craves.The stakes are high, and so are anxiety levels. With the regulator adding to the uncertainty about future market share, investors can expect more volatility. Idea Cellulars shares jumped as much as 7.9% on Tuesday before the company said media speculation about a sale to Vodafone is untrue and preposterous.The fluttering has begun.

0.67,"Singapore/Seoul: Lee Jae-yong, the crown prince of the founding family that controls Samsung Group, is getting expanded corporate power. Now comes the guessing game about what hell do with it.
				   
				On Thursday, Lee officially joined a nine-person board at Samsung Electronics Co., whose botched roll out of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone has delivered a blow to a premier tech brand and cost the company billions of dollars in profit. The move gives the low-profile executive, also known as Jay Y., a big say over top management and strategic calls, including restructurings, mergers and asset sales.His ascension comes on the same day that Samsung reported a sharp decline in profits, as the recall took its toll. Net income fell to 4.41 trillion won ($3.9 billion) in the September quarter; the debacle that may ultimately cost more than $6 billion. Shares in the company rose 0.4% at the close of trade in Seoul.Lee, 48, is already vice chairman of Samsung Electronics and has gained influence since his father, Lee Kun-hee, suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized in 2014. The founding family controls Samsung Group, whose tentacles extend into financial services, hotels, biopharmaceuticals and fashion, through a complex network of cross ownership. So in a way, Lees elevation to the board of the flagship will be something akin to a coronation.We can now say that Lees regime has officially begun, said Lee Chaiwon, chief investment officer at Korea Value Asset Management Co. I think a new era is coming. Lee believes Jay Y.s enhanced influence will be an adrenaline shot for a company in crisis. The company will become more market-friendly, he said, predicting the new board member will quicken its restructuring process.Samsung Electronics has no shortage of challenges, urgent ones. In addition to mopping up after the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, the younger Lee faces a threat from activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. thats pushing Samsung Electronics to simplify its ownership structure. The New York-based fund, founded by stock picker Paul Singer, also wants the company to add independent directors and dish out a special $27 billion dividend to investors.Being a board member means management responsibility, said Heo Pil-seok, chief executive officer of Midas International Asset Management Co. The market will expect Lee to come up with some follow-up steps to settle the Note 7 problem.Samsungs management and board are carefully reviewing all of Elliotts proposals, senior vice-president Robert Yi told a conference call. After buying back more than 11 trillion won of stock since last year, the Suwon-based company plans to shed more light on its shareholder return policy next month, he said.While about 400 investors attended the meeting to vote on Jay Y.s appointment, the man himself wasnt there. Instead it was vice chairman Kwon Oh-hyun and co-chief executive officer Shin Jong-kyun who spoke about the crisis and management shortcomings.Shin said the number of incidents with the Note 7 was in the hundreds and Samsung was continuing to investigate as it revisits every aspect of its hardware, software and production processes.It is not acceptable that we did not meet our own quality assurance standards, said Shin, a former head of the phone business. We know we must work hard to earn back your trust and we are committed to doing just that.Then theres the broader sales slump at Samsung Electronics, which also makes semiconductors and display panels. The company is coping with a drop in LCD panel prices and lower-cost Chinese rivals in the television market. Total third-quarter sales fell to 47.8 trillion won and the company could record its third straight year of decelerating annual revenue, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. For the coming year, Samsung said its planning to spend a record 27 trillion won on plants and equipment as it boosts production of OLED displays.What Samsung needs the most now is the total shake-up of its system and personnel in order to refresh its collapsed brand image following the Note 7 crisis, said Chung Sun-sup, CEO of corporate research firm Chaebul.com. He sees Lees influence being felt across the entire Samsung empire, starting with groups annual management shake-up at the end of the year. He will legally play a lead role in the groups key affairs, including making big deals, personnel reshuffle and other financial agendas, he said.Owing to South Koreas tradition of filial piety, its been difficult for the younger Lee to take command since his father fell ill. That said, Lee attracted media attention in 2015 when he apologized on live television for a Samsung-owned hospitals failure to contain a Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome.Franz-Hermann Hirlinger, the first foreign outside director ever to serve at Samsung Electronics, remembers Lee as a young man who always sat in a corner with his back straight and hands neatly folded on his knees, quietly observing board meetings. Everyone in the room, including Hirlinger, knew that it was part of his training to succeed his father one day.That day has arrived. And Lee is already drawing criticism. Sustinvest Inc., a Seoul-based proxy-advisory firm, said in a letter to shareholders this week that Lee isnt qualified to be on the board because he benefited from inter-affiliate transactions at the Samsung group.There is a widespread expectation for vice chairman Lee to show that he is able to take charge and lead Samsung out of the crisis and usher in change, said Kim Sang-jo, a professor at Hansung University.People who have worked closely with Jay Y. describe him as a polar opposite of his larger-than-life father. The younger Lee is an affable, approachable man with a global view, who wants to modernize South Koreas largest business group, according to Hirlinger.In his new and expanded role, Lees performance will come under even greater scrutiny. Until now, Lee could just enjoy the good times and avoid the bad times and didnt have to take any legal responsibilities, said Chung with Chaebul.com. But if things like the Note 7 happens again, he said, many fingers will point at him. Bloomberg",2016-10-27,iCeczLlNyM59tEfmNqRosK,"Lee Jae-yong, 48, is already vice chairman of Samsung Electronics and has gained influence since his father, Lee Kun-hee, suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized in 2014",both,16:02,Samsung scion Lee Jae-yong begins reign amid Galaxy Note 7 smartphone crisis

				I thought of visiting the closest bank branch I could find in Bandra West. A sole Greater Bombay Cooperative Bank branch gave me some hope. I could see some people waiting for the bank to open so that they may feel rich again. As soon as the branch started its operations, I could see eager customers in the queue look spiffy, only to see the branch staff come out and tell them that they had not received any new currency notes and they did not have a ny new notes.

I walked up to an Axis Bank branch nearby, only to find out that the staff had run out of Rs100 currency notes in the first couple of hours. The staff told all of us to come back by tomorrow to get the new Rs500 and Rs 2,000 currency notes. Maybe a public sector bank will be more amenable to my needs and ensure that I have enough liquidity to last the day before the automated teller machines (ATMs) start working from Friday. I got into an autorickshaw and asked the driver to drop me at a bank branch. Any bank branch would do, I said to myself. An Allahabad Bank branch on Pali Hill Road was the closest we could find. So I walked up to the gate, which was teeming with people at the door. Apparently they wanted my original identity proof and self-attested photocopy to ensure that my money is converted into an acceptable currency over which I shall have ownership rights again. However, I quickly moved to the neighbouring private bank ICICI Bank, thinking the documentation system would be much easier. ICICI Bank, I thought, would have a more streamlined process where the authorities wouldnt want me to give them a hundred different documents. Of course, I forgot that this withdrawal of currency was a government initiative, so every possible box for paperwork has been ticked.Besides, I had lost my old wallet only recently and all of my original government identity proofs were gone though I had the photo copies of them.

And, I could come back anytime later in the week. Of course, I didnt tell her about my lost identity proofs, but it felt good that these options were readily available for some more time.

Edited excerpts:Is Infosys in a better shape now than when you started in this role?Firstly, the change at the leadership level, to have someone like Vishal (Sikka) come (in), has (given) a very clear strategic direction to the company, given the changing landscape in the industry. That is a very big step forward.From the boards perspective, it is very important to have the right leader, and I believe we have the right leader. From the boards perspective, it is important that the leader articulates the strategy (and) the board is aligned to this strategy. I can categorically say that the board is fully aligned to this strategy Vishal has sketched.I and the board feel extremely good that this strategic change in direction to meet the new demands in the business landscape has gone down very well. To communicate this kind of a change in an organization that is as large as Infosys is not easy.Now, of course we have the execution challenges. And those are things which we will learn as we go along. We have had a few bumps. We have had some quick learning. I think, by and large, the strategy is getting executed with the right speed and in the right direction. What is the boards role in designing this strategy?Ideally, the board should pick the right leader for the company and the leader should articulate the strategy. The board has an active role to play for sure in understanding the strategic proposal, challenging that, and getting an alignment between the management and the board. The board cannot stand aside and say that all this is strategic direction and not our problem. The board has to be fully engaged in (the) formulation of strategy.We have had in the last couple of years a pretty deep level of engagement. The board does not meet only for board meetings for approving what is put on the table. So the engagement has been continuous. It has not been even that it takes place (just) once a quarter.The second is that I also think that it is important to think for the board to be learning. Learning is an important DNA of Infosys. Learning does not just apply to executives, the rank and file of management. It equally applies to members of the board. We have had systematic immersion sessions. And our intent is to intensify these sessions. Intent is to make sure that we are not merely sitting and listening in these sessions.This is a journey. It is never-ending. But I do think both these continuous engagement and continuous learning are making it possible to have a very constructive dialogue with the leadership. What are the big challenges faced by the board?I cannot think of a company of this size which has gone through transformation simultaneously on three fronts. The first is the business transformation. All IT firms are going through this, simply because (their) clients are going through this transformation. That is one massive transformation. That is pervasive and happening all across.The second is the move from (being) an iconic promoter-led organization to an organization that is professionally managed at the management and board level. I was actually looking at how many top 100 companies in India have entirely professional board and professional management. If you leave aside the banks and the public sector undertakings, perhaps Infosys is the only company. From a governance construct, this is a very unique and desirable construct, one which would be the ideal construct. But this transformation from a promoter-managed organization to a professional-managed organization both happening at the same time, is a huge transformation. Actually the average tenure of the board, if I leave aside Jeff (Professor Jeffrey Lehman), is two-and-a-half years. So you have a completely new set of people.And so, to be able to navigate this huge company in the right direction, from the point of view of both strategic (issues) and governance, that requires a great deal of work, and a great deal of rescripting of the playbook.We have had challenges in the first quarter. We have had some challenges (with) a couple of good leaders, whom we would have liked to retain, not being there. We have had some challenges regarding the perception issue into governance. I dont think these are real issues but perception issues. But we have very quickly learnt and we are putting in very quickly in place the right kind of solutions. That is the second kind of transformation which we are scripting very well.And then there is the third kind of transformation which is the cultural transformation. From a company that had been pretty much India-centric, we are truly now global-minded. This is a cultural shift. So, in some sense, we need to reset the needle. Each of these transformations is itself a challenge. It may not be apparent to someone on the outside. There is some criticism that Infosyss board does not have enough people with a technology background. Im hearing this for the first time that we do not have enough people from tech background on the board. We have Vishal and (chief operating officer) Pravin (Rao).Beyond Vishal and Pravin?Let me explain the diversity we have on the board. We have Ravi (Venkatesan), who has spent years in technology at Microsoft. Of course, we have Roopa (Kudva) and Punita (Kumar-Sinha). Look at their background. They have not been only in one industry. Roopa has spent a lifetime at a variety of industries, evaluating, assessing, rating a variety of industries. And so has Punita. We have people dealing with different firms, including technology firms. Then we have people like Jeff and John (Etchemendy) who bring the academic discipline to it. Kiran (Mazumdar-Shaw) is a very entrepreneurial person. We have a very good diverse group of people. Having said that, we are constantly on the lookout for the right kind of talent. We are pretty much looking at every possible skill where we think we have a gap and which we think we need to bring in. So we are looking at people. So that is a continuous process. We have people on the board who can read the future, have good understanding of technology trends, are able to challenge the strategic direction. We do take external inputs where we need. So those people dont have to be on the board.So could you perhaps expand the board?We are on the lookout, and we have some candidates in mind and we will do it at the right time.Help us understand the boards relationship with the company founders.So this iconic institution has been created by an iconic leader (N.R. Narayana) Murthy and his wonderful team. This is an outstanding or exceptional kind of history where Murthy and team decided to step down or step away. I must tell you categorically that while I have personally a lot of communication happening with Murthy, not once even by accident have the promoters asked for information which is not available to the public. That must be said to the credit of the promoters that they have not sought any information which would give them any preferential access to any information.We talk about many things. We talk about perceptions that you might have from what is available in the public domain, about the kind of strategic direction. And I take his advice very seriously. But that said, the board has the responsibility to do what is right for the institution. The board is closest to the facts and the situation on the ground.And therefore, information and facts, which are available to the board must drive the board in the right direction, and that decision will be of the board only. Do you think the founders could have expressed their unhappiness with certain board decisions such as Sikkas compensation or Kumar-Sinhas appointment differently?This is a question that should not be asked to me, since this is what the promoters chose to do; so it will not be fair for me to respond. From the boards perspective, we have advice coming from many other investors and not just the promoters. If you believe we do not have discussions with any other investors, you are wrong. The conversations we have with the promoters are no different than those we have with other investors. So it is not right for me to be second-guessing on what they should do. Were you a little saddened by the way they expressed their displeasure?This is a free world and everybody has their own viewpoint. So, do I get saddened by the percentage of negative votes on anything? No. I have a job to do, and we have some 99 percentage in favour and that is a resounding endorsement of the boards recommendation. We should just move on. What issues do you seek their advice on? There are many issues on which I seek advice from many people. So why would you want to only look at what Im seeking from Mr Murthy. Murthy has been a friend for 30 years. We have worked together on boards. We were together on the board of ICICI, we have worked together on many other forums. So he is one person I respect, like other people. So I dont see anything unusual in that. There is this perception that there are twin power centres at Infosys: Murthy and Sikka.First, there is no such twin power centres. That is completely wrong, and that will be very unfair to the promoters. Because, like I mentioned, Murthy has been an exceptional leader who has chosen to stay away and only give advice when sought from. So it will be utterly wrong. Now, the second thing is that when you say there is this perception. Now I dont want to deal with perceptions. We must deal with reality. Im dealing with reality. The reality is that what I have clearly said.What are the issues on which Sikka seeks your advice?Because of the fact that we have a very unique construct, the engagement of the board (with Sikka) has been continuous. My engagement with Vishal has been more intense than the rest of the board. I think we speak almost every week, sometimes multiple times a week. We discuss different issues, say related to people, organization, performance, relating to issues on strategy, customers. We discuss also spirituality and philosophy on weekends. We have an excellent rapport and relationship. We have a lot of common interests. Last night, we were talking on pure sciences. So, the foundation of the relationship is one of complete mutual trust, and complete transparent sharing of information and views. So there are many things that we do.How is the board helping Sikka in this transformation? Its a two-way constructive process. Its not on the basis of a paper that is put on the table. The way it is being done is through continuous, comprehensive and concerted engagement.What is the toughest issue you have advised him on so far?The toughest discussions we have had are on philosophy.Is Vishals compensation of $11 million a year linked to Infosys clocking $20 billion by March 2021?The compensation is linked to targets which are publically given. There is a trajectory for this. The compensation is linked to that trajectory. This is something which the board and Vishal have discussed and agreed.Can you help us understand the weightage of the three specific targets (total revenue, revenue per employee, operating margin) on Sikkas variable pay?There is probably no other Indian company which has so clearly linked pay to targets which have been made public. To my mind, this is the most transparent way of getting shareholders approval. In the trajectory, we have to take into account many things. We need to take into account the industry dynamics, the company dynamics, the people dynamics, all of that. Thats something which the board is charged with the responsibility to do and we will do so.Can you give us some details about the trajectory itself?Can you tell me another company that has been giving the targets for the compensation of the chief executive? There is good reason why no other company does this. It is not because this is inconvenient or anything. It is because, as I said, its a very dynamic situation. Every month, we see changes in the landscape. Every month, we see new challenges. The board is a delegated authority of the shareholders to run this company. It is therefore in the fitness of things that the board does the job that has been entrusted by the shareholders. It doesnt kick back to the shareholders the job that has been entrusted. We have gone one step further to say, yes this long-term goal is what we believe must be the reference point for the compensation.So is it more aspirational in nature?No, I have said that there is nothing aspirational in this. This is a target which the company is looking at, is pursuing. Now nothing is cast in stone. But this is, at the moment, the target that we have.Are you saying that the growth of the industry will also be taken into account?The growth of the industry is pretty much the playfield, right? So we have got to look at the growth of the industry in the context of assessment.(For any company,) the target is fixed for the annual budget in the context of what you see is the market situation. Technology changes, all of it are taken into account. A five-year goal is fixed on what you believe is the kind of the trajectory in this. We have to keep constantly calibrating both the environment and the industry. As of now, we are not changing those targets (for Infosys).Can they be changed?Thats a speculative question. Why did the board change its original plan on the promised payment to former chief financial officer Rajiv Bansal?All I can say is I have already made the statement suo motu in the AGM (annual general meeting). You wrote this article (referring to Mints story in May on Bansals unusually high severance pay). Because you wrote this article, I thought it is important and it is our responsibility to make sure that we address this issue. So the issue was not raised in the AGM, but I made a suo motu statement saying that we believe that there is no impropriety.There is a severance agreement. There are rights of the parties in the contract. And the contract will be administrated in line with the rights of the parties. Period. That is all. So has there been any change in the agreement?That is not something you need to be looking at all. I am only saying there is a contract, (there are) the rights of the parties in the contract and the contract will be administered in line with the contractual rights of the parties. Period.So is it fair to assume that you could rework it if one of the parties did not abide by its terms?This is an entirely legal issue. All I need to say is that there are no other extraneous considerations for this, for the administration of this. It will be driven by the contractual rights. Has anything happened within the realms of that contract that could lead to a change in it?No matter where you are coming from, the only two things which are relevant to the public and relevant to everybody else (are): Is this an issue where there is impropriety? I have said no, repeatedly no, and I stand by that.Is this contract getting changed or cancelled for any other extraneous considerations? I am going a step further to say: The contract will be administered based on the rights of the parties in the contract. Period.How do you like Sikkas leadership style?We have the right kind of leader in Vishal. His understanding of the changes, his insight into the changes is outstanding. Vishals articulation of a solution, even in the context of the auto industry for example or the banking industry, is absolutely on the dot. We have a very good leader who understands client requirements and his client connect is exceptional. His strategic direction is exceptional. He has been a phenomenal person to motivate a very, very large crowd. Its not easy for a new person to step in and have this kind of influence. We certainly have an exceptional leader.How has the boards role at a company changed?The role of a board has changed phenomenally, and for the good. It is no longer this friends club that you had in the past and people coming to have a cup of coffee and go back. This is the trusteeship concept. That is getting to be far better understood now by enlightened boards, and therefore, the responsibility that comes with that. In the process, the engagement is getting to be much more. Increasingly, I find that the board meeting is just one punctuation mark in that engagement. It also brings in the need for a greater amount of understanding of the business and the independence to challenge.

His regular ENT (ear, nose and throat) specialist had gone abroad for a medical conference and he didnt know of any other in his neighbourhood. He surfed the web for help and discovered, to his momentary relief, that he could fix an appointment online with a specialist at one of the hospitals not far from where he lived.
				   
				Hospitals, especially in India, have for long cut a sorry figure in terms of their digital savvy and use of information technology (IT) to be on par with their counterparts in sectors such as banking and telecom.According to Tirupathi Karthik, CEO of Napier Healthcare, a Singapore-based provider of software solutions to the healthcare industry, As compared to a global average of 22.5% of income spent on IT by healthcare providers, or even 6-15% being invested in IT in other sectors within India, anecdotal data from multiple sources indicate that healthcare providers in India rarely spend more than 0.5% of their annual revenue on information technology.  But things have been changing for some time, albeit at a pace slower than many would want. Leading the change are large hospital chains such as Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd, Max Healthcare Institute Ltd and Fortis Healthcare Ltd.Prodded on by the need to take control of their sprawling operationswhich span dozens of hospitals in multiple citieson the one hand, and the rising expectations of tech-empowered consumers on the other, these modern hospitals are setting the template for healthcare in India.High time they did so. If you looked at the hospitals in India around 10 years back, they were very basic in terms of tech infrastructure. Besides, independent doctors got what they pretty much wanted. This led to lack of control with the management and poor visibility into the entire treatment and costs hospitals had to bear, says Varun Gera, founder and chief executive of HealthAssure Pvt. Ltd, a primary  healthcare aggregator that has partnered with almost 2,300 clinics, including diagnostic labs and hospital OPDs (out-patient departments). He says that somewhere along the line hospitals had to work as hospitals and it could no longer be the case of doctors having their own way of doing things. While part of this doctors-management clash had to do with egos, a more significant role was played by ITthe lack of it in the early days and increasing enablement as time went on. It is the clinical protocols, organisation-wide processes and use of IT tools through which hospitals, particularly those with a corporate road map to grow fast, could gain better control, get visibility into how treatment is given, and embrace more standardization for better healthcare outcomes across their chain of facilities.Once processes and IT tools began to be adopted, hospitals moved on from using basic networking and hospital information systems (HIS) to looking at electronic medical records (EMRs) and other advanced deployments for improving efficiency as well as patient care.According to research firm Gartner Inc., Indian healthcare providers are set to spend $1.2 billion on IT products and services in 2016, including telecom services.  Among the key areas in which hospitals are increasingly focusing their IT efforts are online doctor appointments, data capture of patients visiting the hospitals and applying analytics tools to get insights into their operations.One of the large hospital chains investing big time in IT is Apollo. One of the things we have done is enabled online appointment for doctors. Earlier, less than 10% of our patients came by appointment. Now at Apollo almost 50% of patients are coming by appointment, says Sangita Reddy, joint managing director, Apollo Hospitals.That is a huge change in terms of avoiding the chaos resulting from a lot of patients just landing up at its hospitals all over India. It also allows Apollo to focus on the more important task of clinical care rather than manage hordes of patients shuffling from one department to the other on its premises.More significant change is afoot through the use of data analytics for both clinical and non-clinical insights. We are collecting about 55% of all our patients clinical data electronically, which is enabling us to create a digital warehouse. This digital warehouse, in turn, is enabling us to do data mining and use this data in different ways, says Reddy.These efforts are helping Apollo in workflow prediction, staffing, communication, etc., and helping the organization turn into a data-driven enterprise.One of the key areas in which analytics is being applied at Apollo, according to Reddy, is the use of predictive analytics for clinical purposes. We have pioneered the concept of personalized health check-ups in India: instead of a common check-up, it is customized based on analytics of data of almost 1 million patients that have visited our hospitals over the years, she says. The decision tree for providing healthcare is being evolved based on scenario building through matching a particular medicine with a particular disease or condition that previous patients had encountered. The result is quicker treatment with improved outcomes.The analytics tool enhances the effectiveness of the medication that doctors choose, says Reddy.On the question of the acceptance of such tools by the medical fraternity, she says, We use these predictive analytics tools in a recommendatory manner, so its not forced on the doctorsand we have found a very high degree of acceptance. Currently being used in its large hospitals, Apollo will soon extend its use to other hospitals as well.There is a lot of scope for improvement in the way hospitals in India operate and use IT to manage operations and deliver healthcare in a seamless manner taking into account the intricacies involved in settling health insurance claims. According to Gera, The whole focus now is on getting the data out and efficiency of operations. The way hospitals operate currently is much fractured, as there are multiple complexities involved in their operations.And while technology cannot do everything for hospitals, the right tools and processes can make a big difference to the quality and speed of healthcare delivery in India.Among the tools for improving or aiding clinical outcomes, International Business Machines Corp.s Watson cognitive computing solutions for healthcare are being considered by many hospitals in India. One of the first to implement it is Manipal Hospital Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. According to IBM, Watson for Oncology is now in use by oncologists at six locations in the Manipal Hospitals network to provide information and insights to physicians to help them identify personalised, evidence-based cancer care options across India.If the past decade signified the modernisation of hospitals in terms of physical infrastructure, medical equipment and the like, the next one is likely to be defined by integration of multiple IT tools, advanced analytics solutions, health monitoring devices and Internet of Thingsunder which medical devices, computer systems, smartphones and diagnostic equipment will share data with each other in real time for individualised, improved healthcare.",2016-11-04,iX1AMyGsjOevaUwtoZVn4N,"Hospitals have for long cut a sorry figure in terms of digital savvy and the use of information technology.

-0.25,"Melbourne: Indian mining giant Adani on Thursday said it plans to start construction of a $21.7 billion Carmichael coal mine project in Australia in 2017 after years of legal delays over environmental approvals. 
				   
				The company is moving ahead, having already invested more than 3.3 billion dollar to date, and still proposes to start the construction stage in the third quarter of 2017, the companys spokesperson said, but added that the uncertainty continued in relation to the Queensland Governments proposed water legislation. Adani has already complied with existing legislation, he said. There is also the outstanding legal challenges to decisions and approvals already granted by both the Commonwealth and State governments, he added. Adanis efforts to build one of the worlds largest coal mine project in Australias Queensland state has been hampered time and again since its launch six years ago. A federal court in August last year had revoked the original approval due to environmental concerns. In October last year, the project got a new lease of life after the Australian government gave its re-approval. Earlier this month, the Queensland Government announced invoking special powers to help progress the Adanis project by giving it special prescribed project status. Adanis latest comments came as Queensland-based regional leaders strongly demanded the state and federal governments to clear the project without any further delays. In an open letter published in major newspapers around the state on Thursday, several Mayors and business leaders said, Its time to get Adanis Galilee projects goingno more red tape, no more delays. We cant afford new roadblocks or delays including new water legislation that activists can exploit in new court ­appeals to kill this project, the letter said. With six years of multiple approval processes and multiple court reviews, this project has the most stringent environment conditions ever. That includes detailed water modelling and coordinatorGeneral and federal approvals that have been reviewed and upheld by government, the letter said. Enough is enough. Anything more at this late stage in approvals is just red tape and duplication, it noted. Over a dozen signatories of this letter include Rockhampton Regional Councils mayor Margaret Strelow, Whitsunday Regional Council mayor Andrew Wilcox, Bowen Basin Mining club director Jodie Currie, Mineral Council of Australia chief executive officer (CEO) Brendan Pearson, Queensland Resources Council CEO Michael Roche and Adani Australia CEO J Janakraj.

-0.54,"Bangalore/Mumbai: Amid the carnage on Wall Street in 2008, as Bank of America Corp. was trying to forge its rushed merger with Merrill Lynch & Co., Natarajan Chandrasekaran boarded a plane for New York to try to reassure the two financial behemoths that an Indian IT company could make the systems of their strikingly different cultures work together.
				   
				Chandrasekaran, known as Chandra, was then chief operating officer of Asias largest IT services exporter, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS). Over the following weeks he fended off global rivals who smelled an opportunity to muscle in, and set about integrating the banks systems and assuaging the new managements anxieties about outsourcing to a foreign supplier. TCS kept the business and grew it substantially.Last week, Chandra, now chief executive officer of TCS, was chosen for an even more fraught diplomatic task: to resurrect the image and fortunes of the Tata Group, Indias biggest conglomerate, which has been racked by losses at some of its biggest units, and by a boardroom battle that has threatened to turn the workings of the venerable corporation into a media soap-opera.Tata Sons, the group holding company, named Chandra, 53, as chairman, taking over on 21 February from interim chairman Ratan Tata. Tata, 79, had run the family business for more than two decades before handing over in 2012 to his hand-picked successor, Cyrus Mistry. In October, Tata Sons shocked Indias corporate community by firing Mistry, reinstalling Ratan Tata and promising to find a replacement by March. Chandra was a front runner for the job, a Tata employee almost all his working life, who grew TCS into the conglomerates most successful business, with about $16 billion in sales.Yet he is both an insider and an outsider. While he has been with the group since joining as an intern three decades ago, he is the first chairman who is not a Parsi, the shrinking ethnic group of Zoroastrians that boasts a disproportionately high number of Indias business elite. He is only the third person without the Tata name to get the job, and the first without a close family tie to the Tatas.IT CareerMoreover, his career and success has all been with TCS, virtually an island within the group that serves many of the worlds top corporations with a young, skilled, technical workforce. As head of Tata Sons, he will be responsible for a conglomerate that assembles buses in Zambia, serves prawn kalimiri to diners at its Bombay Brasserie in London, sells salt to Indian families at Rs18(27 cents) a kilo, and runs hundreds of other businesses across the world.He served both TCS and the customer commendably during the BofA-ML merger. Now he has the chance to build a positive organization by bonding together various companies and their half-a-million plus employees, said S. Ramadorai, the previous CEO of TCS. He is non-confrontational and, at the same time, does not foolishly ignore problems.Chandras appointment came after TCS announced it had made the equivalent of $1 billion in quarterly profit for the first time. Tatas star unit accounts for over half of the groups market value.A five-man panel unanimously chose Chandra from a list of more than a dozen candidates. He stood out both within the group and outside, said former bureaucrat Vijay Singh, a non-executive director on the board of Tata Sons, which ratified the selection. A Tata Sons statement said Chandra would uphold the groups values and adhere to its high standard of practicesthings the board previously accused Mistry of failing to do.We are at an inflection point, said Chandra in a statement after his appointment. I am aware that this role comes with huge responsibilities. It will be my endeavor to help progress the group with the ethos, ethics and values that the Tata group has been built on. Chandra declined an interview request for this story.Steel lossesFacing him is a menu of corporate issues, including the money-losing UK operations of Tata Steel Ltd., the overhang from failed ambitions like Tata Motors Ltd.s cheap Nano car, debt-ridden Indian Hotels Co., and a $1.17 billion arbitration battle with telecom partner NTT Docomo Inc. Mistry has previously defended his time as chairman, when he tried to reduce debt built up during a series of global acquisitions by Ratan Tata. In an e-mail to directors after his dismissal, Mistry said the group may face Rs1.18 trillion in writedowns over time because of  legacy hotspots he inherited.Mistry, whose family owns an 18% stake in Tata Sons, filed a case with the National Company Law Tribunal seeking the appointment of an administrator to oversee the companys affairs, a forensic audit and a probe into the role of the trustees of Tata trusts, the majority shareholders of Tata Sons. Hes asked for Ratan Tata, head of the trusts, to be restrained from attending board meetings. A spokesman for Mistry said he would not comment as the matter is subject to the legal proceedings.Investors expect Chandra to act quickly to resolve governance issues, said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director at proxy advisory firm InGovern Research Services Pvt. Key to his success will be how he handles Ratan Tata, who has indicated that he may step down as chairman of the trusts this year. Tata instigated the Nano project, a troubled airline venture and many of the other expansions that are now draining the groups resources.Tata congratulated Chandra on Twitter, saying he was sure the new chairman would protect the groups values and ethics. A Tata Group spokesman declined to comment.Chandra is an optimist, he thinks big and will go after positive outcomes in the new job, said Krishnakumar N., executive chairman of rival Indian IT services company Mindtree Ltd.The son of a farmer in rural southern India, Chandra studied in a Tamil-language school rather than gaining the English-language education favored by the middle class.He joined TCS in 1987 after completing a masters in Computer Applications from Regional Engineering College, Trichy, Tamil Nadu. His leadership talent was spotted by Ramadorai in 1993 when Chandra was praised by customer International Business Machines Corp. He was put in charge of a major project for British Telecommunications Plc. When Ramadorai became TCSs CEO, he chose Chandra as his executive assistant.He loved meeting customers, and it was never a Hi-How-Are-You? kind of a meeting, Ramadorai said in a telephone interview. He put the client at the center of the universe, made every conversation count and nurtured clients like American Express.Young CEOChandra took over as chief executive of TCS in 2009 at the age of 46. Over the next seven years, he would triple the IT companys share price and revenue and more than double its headcount.As Chandras corporate universe expanded, so did his interests, according to colleagues. Hes fond of photography and classical music, but his real passion is running. He has run marathons in Boston, Chicago, Berlin, New York, Tokyo and other cities.Being a runner has greatly shaped my thinking as a leader, Chandra told Runners World in October 2015. You have to decide on the length of the engagement, develop endurance to handle setbacks and increase speed when the competition demands it. You have to perform with your heart and your mind.At TCS, Chandra backed new technologies from cloud to mobile and evangelized to global corporations about digital disruption, always with a reputation for building close relationships with clients. Som Mittal, former head of Hewlett-Packard Co.s India operations, worked with Chandra for years in the software-industry trade body Nasscom and said if he texted Chandra, hed get a call back within 20 minutes.Whether he was preparing for a marathon in London or stepping into a client meeting in New York, he unfailingly called back, no matter what timezone and which corner of the globe he was in, said Mittal. He was also an inveterate traveler who would fly to client meetings even for the smallest deals. He has this uncanny ability of making everyone think they are his dearest friends.Chandra drove projects at TCS that dispersed the chaotic crowds and touts that used to clog the entrances of Indias passport offices and its best-known hospital, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi. He charted new territories for TCS in Latin America and Japan by hiring local talent.His new role comes with a different set of challenges.

-0.69,"Melbourne:  Adanis plan to build one of the worlds largest coal mines in Australia received a boost on Thursday by a last-minute amendment to Queenslands new water laws that would exempt the Indian mining giants controversy-hit 21.7 billion dollar project from any public objection process. 
				   
				The Queensland government has granted Adanis Carmichael mine project in the Galilee Basin an 11th-hour exemption to new water laws that could have seen the project subjected to further legal challenges. The government has introduced laws requiring Queensland mining projects to obtain a water licence, in an effort to reduce the impact on ground water. However, the Annastacia Palaszczuk government on Wednesday added an amendment to the laws that will allow the Adani mine project, which has already faced significant legal action, to avoid court challenges to its water licence. Under the amendment, projects that have already finalised proceedings with the Land Court will be able to obtain a licence from the government without being subjected to challenges from the public, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. State environment minister Steven Miles had moved the amendment which would mean that companies that had already undergone scrutiny through an environmental impact statement (EIS) and the Land Court would still require a water licence but would not have to go through the public objection process. This will be achieved by allowing associated water licence applications to be exempt from public notification if the mining project has already been through an EIS process and a Land Court objections hearing in which objectors tested the groundwater modelling undertaken by the project proponent with expert evidence of their own, Miles said. That particular project has been through two very significant Land Court cases and so what weve said is if they can demonstrate that they have met the requirements of the water licence and all of those elements had been tested in previous Land Court hearings, then this water licence stage would not be appealable in the Land Court, Miles said. It would still be subject to potential judicial review, but not a full Land Court challenge, he added.In response to the latest move, Adani Australia welcomed the state governments support for recognising that the company has already passed all scientific and legal examinations to ensure rigorous measures are in place to manage water impacts at its Carmichael coal mine. The amendment recognises the significant work Adani has already done to manage water impacts and avoids unintended and unnecessary duplication and further delay for the 21 billion dollar projects involving a mine and infrastructure including a rail link and port developments, Adani said in a statement.

				A stronger US dollar also weighed as the currency surge made it more expensive to hold dollar-denominated commodities. Brent crude futures were down $1.01, or 1.8%, at $56.09 a barrel at 3.36pm. US crude futures were trading at $52.99 per barrel, down $1, or 1.85%.We see the optimism surrounding Opec and non-Opec production cuts being counterbalanced by fears of higher US crude production as the higher rig count of last Friday still weighs, said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro.Last week, US energy companies added oil rigs for a tenth week in a row, Baker Hughes data showed, extending a recovery in activity into an eighth month as crude prices remained at levels at which many drillers can operate profitably.This raised concerns that US production is increasing and undermining efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and others to cut output.Rising exports from Iran also added to bearish sentiment. Iran has sold more than 13 million barrels of oil held on tankers at sea, capitalising on its exemption from a global deal to cut production in order to regain market share and court new buyers.In Iraq, Opecs second-biggest producer, a record 3.51 million barrels per day (bpd) were exported from its port in Basra in December, officials said, although they added that the country would comply with its commitment to lower output by an average of 210,000 bpd from January.On the other hand, Russia, one of the worlds largest crude producers, appeared to be sticking to the agreement to cut as Russian energy market sources told Reuters the countrys output had slipped in the first week of the month.Oil and gas condensate output averaged 11.1 million bpd from 1 January to 8 January, down from Octobers 11.247 million bpd.

-0.25,"On 15 January, at least 42,000 runners lined up at the starting point of the Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon, the largest road-run event in Asia. Jaspal Bindra, who came up with the idea in 2004, was nowhere to be seen. In 2016 too, he was not around. 
				   
				Bindra, the banks chief executive officer (CEO) for Asia and group executive director till early 2015, had not missed a single Mumbai Marathon till 2016. He had been living in Hong Kong from 2008 but would fly down for the eventalways held on the third Sunday in Januaryand cheer the runners. A few days ahead of the Mumbai Marathon, Bindra, 56, is a few minutes late for our luncheon meeting  at the NRI (Not Really Indian) restaurant at the Bandra-Kurla Complex in Mumbai. To avoid the hassle of choosing individual dishes, we opt for Jugal Bandi, a meal for two, accompanied by a glass of Chandon Brut each. The starters are South African peri peri wings, BBQ prawns and a Burmese green tea salad; this year-old restaurant serves Indian-inflected cuisine from around the world. As always, Bindra is dressed immaculately, in a white shirt and sky-blue turban. Some 15 years ago, over dinner at a different restaurant in south Mumbaihe was then regional general manager, India, and CEO of Standard Chartered BankBindra, digging into his chicken satay and prawn tempura, had commented, As long as I have an active sex life, I dont need to play golf. Those were not Twitter days, so it did not get wide publicity, but the banking community took note. He was perceived to be aggressive, someone who calls a spade a spade.During his two-year tenure as head of corporate and institutional banking at StanChart (1998-2000) and later as the head of both StanChart and ANZ Grindlays (he oversaw the merger of the two), Bindra showed 3,200 employees the doornearly 50% of the employee strength then.By a twist of fate, he himself had to quit the bank where he was one of the top five executives. Did he feel insecure after the StanChart board, under pressure from shareholders, asked CEO Peter Sands to leave? Bindras answer is quite logical. He was one of the top four executives of the bank reporting to Sands. The others were Mike Rees (overseeing the wholesale and retail assets), Andy Halford (group chief financial officer) and V. Shankar (another banker of Indian origin, in charge of Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Americas). Had the new CEO come from within the bank, I would have got a different responsibility. But since Sands successor came from outside, all four of us would have continued to do the same job. At mid-50s, I was looking for a different responsibility, he says. Was he eyeing the top job? Well, maybe not at that point of time but yes, if I had stuck around, I would have liked the challenge, Bindra says, nibbling on the spicy wings.He was the first to leave after Sands. By end-February 2015, he had put in his papers. Shankar and Rees followed him. Did he get a ton of money as a severance package? The standard practice in the bank is one years remuneration when a board-level executive quits. And he was not allowed to take up any job in the financial sector for a year after resigning.I cannot resist the temptation of asking how StanChart got into a situation in India where its bad assets ballooned and profits plunged. India, which accounts for anything from 15-20% of the banks global profits, and is probably the second-most important market along with Singapore, after Hong Kong, has gone through a real bad patch in the past few years. Was the local management (which was reporting to Bindra) reckless? Was it greed for balance-sheet growth that got the bank into trouble?Bindra says the bank actually weathered the collapse of Lehman Brothers well and continued to show growth in profit until 2012. Thereafter, it suffered on account of a severe structural shrinkage in commodity prices. What he means is that the companies to which the bank had exposure were in the commodity space and once they suffered, their ability to service bank loans was dented.Why did StanChart take such large exposures to so many companies in India which have in any case been over-leveraged, laden with loans they couldnt repay? Bindra says this assumption is not entirely correct. Our internal norms do not allow the bank to take more than 50% exposure in any loan. This means that even if it gives, say, a $1 billion loan to a particular company, it sells down 50-75% of it to other lenders within 90 days of disbursing the loan. So, we were as affected as others. It is not fair to say only StanChart accumulated bad assets.As the main course arrivesSri Lankan Potli Murg and dal makhani with tandoori roti and riceI decide to shift my focus to the present. Like quite a few other global Indian bankers, he is back in the country to do something on his own. Is it the proverbial return of the prodigal son? Also, what made him pick up a stake in Centrum Capital Ltd, a non-banking finance company (NBFC), and become an entrepreneur?I was 55 when I was leaving StanChart. I had three choices before meI could have got a similar job overseas and probably run a smaller bank as CEO; partially retire and join a few boards of companies and offer advisory services; or become an entrepreneur. And if I were to be an entrepreneur, it had to be in India, he says. Where else can you grow business in the banking and finance space? The public sector banks are losing their market share, foreign banks are shrinking business by design.... This is the best time to be in India. I could not afford to miss this window, Bindra says.Last April, he reportedly picked up close to a 20% stake in Centrum, started in 1995 by Bindras long-time friend Chandir Gidwani and Khushrooh Byramjee at the Bombay Mutual Building in Fort. It is a financial services firm with a presence in corporate finance, foreign exchange, wealth management, institutional broking and investment banking. It manages around Rs10,000- crore assets in its wealth management portfolio but does not have a balance sheet as such, for it does not give loans. Bindra is adding that piece to Centrum. He has started giving loans ranging from Rs5-20 crore to small and medium-size entrepreneurs. Not too many banks dabble in this segment where financing is based primarily on cash flows, not balance sheets. He has already built a portfolio of Rs400 crore in this business. Another new business is small and affordable housing finance in the range of Rs10-25 lakh. Again, there is a huge opportunity with the governments big push for affordable housing and drop in the cost of money. The third new fund-based business is private equity. We need to compete with some of the private banks and a few other NBFCs, not the entire banking system, Bindra says.When he picked up the stake in Centrum, the market value of the NBFC was Rs450 crore. Now it has crossed Rs1,500 crore. I assume that at Rs450 crore market value, for a 20% stake, he would have put in Rs90 crore. But Bindra says that may not be the correct figure as he has picked up a stake in the holding company, not the listed entity. Now all three partnersGidwani, Byramjee and Bindrahold equal stakes of around 20% each in the listed entity.After graduating from XLRI, a management school in Jamshedpur, Bindra joined Bank of America, where he spent 10 years. He spent another five at the Union Bank of Switzerland as head of business development in India before shifting to StanChart in August 1998, where he remained for 17 years. Brought up in Kolkata and many district towns in West Bengal (his father was a police officer), Bindras Bengal connection is still alive. His wife is from Asansol, and he visits his in-laws often. He can speak fluent Bengali but has not developed a sweet tooth. So, while I choose butterscotch ice cream for dessert, he orders coffee.The last round of conversation predictably revolves around demonetization. He joins the discussion a bit diplomatically. He agrees that digital banking in the unorganized sector is not easy but says that once we go cashless, the cost of operations will definitely come down and size will become less relevant for NBFCs. Currently, Centrum employs 2,000 people; for the foreign exchange business, its biggest earner, it has a presence at 19 airports and 100 outlets spread over 45 cities. Money is not a problem. There are plenty of funds available both as debt and equity. My challenge is to grow and build a solid track record and be in the reckoning to set up a bank. If available, we can buy a bank too, he says. All these, if at all, will happen after 2020. Till then, he wants to build a solid NBFC which can compete with private banks effectively.Like the Mumbai Marathon, StanCharts Indian Depository Receipts, or IDR, was also Bindras baby. He agrees with me that it was a flop. There have been issues such as tax and the class of investors who could buy IDRs. The insurance firms were never allowed to buy.... It was an experiment that failed, he says. StanChart remains the first and only foreign company to launch an IDR. But all that is behind him. I remind him of his life-size bronze statue on the eighth floor of Standard Chartered Bank Plcs old headquarters at Londons 1, Aldermanbury Squarea unique initiative of the bank to showcase the diversity of its employee base. In June 2013, the headquarters were shifted to 1, Basinghall Avenue in London. Does the new office still have his statue? He shrugs his shoulders. Bindra doesnt really care much for such things now.That day, the Centrum stock hit its lifetime high of Rs34.50. In 2016, when Bindra took over as the executive chairman and a promoter, it was trading at around Rs10.His favourite memory: Carrying the Olympic-flame torch for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.One assignment he loved: Global head of diversity and inclusion at StanChart, 2005-13.His hobby: Watching films, travelling with his wife.Favourite place on earth: Asansol, where his in-laws live (to keep his marriage alive!).One thing he would like to forget: the StanChart IDR; it was ahead of its time.One achievement he is proud of: the Mumbai Marathon.One bit of media coverage that he cherishes: Being featured in  Time magazine in 2010.",2017-01-27,ivDxiaKv9AlNq4jlbx7hyN,"Standard Chartereds man for India till early 2015, Bindra is back  now as an entrepreneur",both,15:32,Jaspal Bindra: Return of the prodigal son
-0.69,"Bengaluru: In 1999, British entrepreneur Kevin Ashton coined the term Internet of Things while he was working at Procter & Gamble. Around that time, he made a presentation on putting sensors in everyday objects that would be powered by the Internet. Shortly afterwards, he co-founded a research centre in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology called the Auto-ID Centre.
				   
				Since then, Ashton founded three more companies in IoT. In an interview on the sidelines of the Nasscom Engineering Summit on Wednesday on IoTs evolution and challenges. On a lighter note, when asked about the US presidential elections, Ashton said emphatically, Trump wont win. He doesnt stand a chance. Edited excerpts:Its been 17 years since you coined the term Internet of Things. However, overall results in terms of scaling up have been mixed. Is IoT facing a mid-life crisis of sorts?I think I am! (laughs) Nothe very interesting thing that you see about the Internet of Things iswhen it works, its kind of invisible. Like all good technology. Just as a simple example, if you look at the rise of the smartphone, one of the funny things about smartphone is that its got the word phone in it today  because its not what it is. Its not a phone. Phone is an app that sometimes you use  so, what is a smartphone? Some say its a pocket-sized computer. But thats not really it either. At least not how I look at it because a typical smartphone today has as many as 10 network sensors. Thats twice as many as a human being. So its a very sentient platformand the obvious sensors are for example, cameras, microphones, etc. But your smartphone knows where it is even when you dont. It measures things like barometric pressuremany of them can detect your heartbeat or fingerprint or your moving. The vision of the Internet of Things is network sensors. Also Read: Indian IoT market to touch $15 billion by 2020: NasscomAnd the smartphone is just a visible example of a network sensor platformthe irony is that just because its called a phone nobody seems to realise it. My view is that were 15 years into a 100-year roll-out. So, I think if theres any sort of crisis to IoT, itll be a teenage sort of crisis were still in a very early growth phaseI dont think weve grown up yet. IoT deployments are moving at a much slower pace than was originally hoped. In many organisations, its still at a proof of concept stage. Why is the IoT facing challenges in scaling up?Its a software challenge that you have right now. We got very good at gathering sensor data. Sensors have become very cheap, networking has become very cheapthe new challenge is how to automatically process that data. In the 20th century, you got some data and you put it on a spreadsheet and everybody looked at the spreadsheet. In the 21st century, the machine looks at the data and figures out whats important and what to do with the data. Theres some complexity theretechnological machine learning is getting better all the time, but thats the limit right now. What are the futuristic applications of IoT that seem like science fiction now?The technology points to what you call autonomous automation. So, we think of automation right now, we think of giving machine a task, it executes a task, it stops. What will happen in the Internet of Things age is thats the back-loop thatll keep turning. The machine will change something in the world somehow, they will then sense that change and then figure out what to do next with that change. Any examples that you can think of? The easy one is self-driving cars. Thats coming very quickly everywhere... So this sort of continuous autonomous automation which will start with self-driving cars, I think that technology will start applying itself in the home where youll see things like more sophisticated vacuum cleaners, things like laundering which today is barely automaticthats the kind of stuff that youre going to see. Continuous autonomous automation.How does India compare with the tech boom that you saw in the US?The first time I came to India I came as a student and I got a tourist railway pass. I was in Bombay and then I travelled around the country kind of in a clockwise direction. I always told my Indian friends that Ive seen more of India than they have. Because of the direction of travel, Bangalore was one of the last places I came to and the contrast between Bangalore and what was Calcutta back then and Delhi and Bombay was very striking. And so, its always amazing to come back here and remember what it was like. And thats representative of the changes around the world. Which is the age of United States as a world technology leader is really overwhich is very surprising to Americans because they talk about Facebook or Google. But if you look at whats been going on in the market, US tech exports is sort of flat to declining and then you have Asian nations particularly China, Korea, Singapore and India that are on the rise. And whats fuelling that is very interesting to think about when youre in Bangalore  which is what drove America to technological excellence in the 20th century was the establishment of some major technology universities between 1900 and 1950 and then significant government investment in science and research and development between 1950 and 1970. And those investments laid the foundation for, take for example, all the tech companies of the dotcom boom, and were seeing the end of that tail now with Google and Facebook. Now if you look at whats happened in Asia, you basically see the same path only a little later. Theres an investment in education in technology, followed by government investment in pure science and R&D which is inevitably followed by an expansive technology sector that is supposed to be disruptive to more mature tech economies. If you think of India with that pattern in mind, you have IITs everywhere, which in the 20th century exported its undergraduates to places like MIT but now they are coming back.What you see in India is also an amazing space program right here in Bangalore, increasing investment in defence and development. And what that is inevitably leading to is India becoming not just an offshore-outsource subsidiary centre of technology, but also a leading exporter of high technology and leading user of high technology. I expect that we really are at the beginning of the Indian technology revolutionTheyre going to form amazing technology companies and theyll do it in areas like the Internet of Things which is new and disruptiveIts great to come here and talk about the Internet of Things because my expectation is that 5-10 years from now, India will be one of the top three IoT tech exporters in the world.

0.0,"With the wisdom of hindsight, it should have been an obvious question. When quarter after quarter the majority of large listed companies are posting poor financial results, how can private sector lenders who, too, lent to these firms be out of trouble?
				   
				To be sure, the market has always had lingering concerns on the asset quality of some lenders such as ICICI Bank Ltd and Axis Bank even when they were doing well in other yardsticks such as credit growth or margins or net profit growth. Thats why these two banks had traded at a good discount to HDFC Bank Ltd, which has predominantly retail loans in its portfolio.Some of these fears have come true in recent times.For Axis Bank Ltd, gross bad loans rose 36.7% to Rs.6,087 crore in the six months ended 31 March. For ICICI Bank, bad loans have risen by almost two-thirds in the same period to Rs.26,221 crore. And investors have shown their displeasure by beating down share prices more than the benchmark Bankex since the company reported its September quarter earnings. Axis Bank has lost 10% of its value and ICICI Bank almost 20%.Now, both banks have decided to share more information about potential stressed assets rather than let market speculation run riot. Those numbers show that things have not turned the corner.Axis Bank created an asset quality watch list of Rs.22,268 crore loans that are likely to be the source of future stress. Of this, it expects 60%, or Rs.13,361 crore, to go bad over the next two years, a number higher than the combined slippages of the past two fiscal years.ICICI Banks watch list is more than double the size at Rs.52,638 crore. This includes already restructured loans of Rs.8,573 crore, loans under the strategic debt restructuring process (SDR) and 5/25 refinancing scheme. Overall, the bank has indicated that it has about 13.3% exposure (including non-funded exposures) in stressed sectors such as power, mining, iron and steel, cement and rigs. Of this, 4.8%, or Rs.44,000 crore, are at high risk and may slip into NPAs in the coming quarters. Therefore, the bank has created a reserve of Rs.3,600 crore as contingency provisions against this exposure.This grim outlook will also have a bearing on other yardsticks such as credit growth and profitability. ICICI Bank, for instance, has guided for 5-7% growth in corporate loans as it switches its focus to higher rated firms and reduces concentration risks in its portfolio. This will naturally dent margins as well.With private corporate earnings yet to show a meaningful improvement, and investment demand some time away amid the highest level of stalled projects in a couple of years, these lenders will continue feeling the heat.",2016-05-01,jIPlZ7HOg8Xa1BjN4ucnKO,"With earnings yet to show meaningful improvement, and investment demand some time away, private lenders will continue feeling the heat

0.24,"The strings attached to the governments relief measures for sugar mills are becoming visible. On Wednesday, shares of sugar mills fell after news that the government may impose stock limits. This is a regressive step, moving away from decontrol, but is not a surprise altogether.
				   
				Stock limits will mean sugar in excess of the limits will be sold, leading to more supply and lower prices. The governments concern must be rising sugar prices. But they have been rising since end-September, so why the late reaction? The increase in recent months has been rapid. Since end-January, wholesale sugar prices are up by as much as 17%, while they are up by 39% since end-September. Globally, sugar prices have risen because of bad weather affecting the sugar cane crop in major producing countries such as India, Brazil and Thailand.That stress is visible in Indias output. Sugar production as of 15 April is down by 8% at 24.3 million tonnes (mt) from a year ago, says the Indian Sugar Mills Association (Isma). Whether Ismas estimate of 26 mt will be met remains to be seen, as only 117 mills are operating as of 15 April, compared with 245 a year ago. Prices may keep rising, as this situation unfolds.So what? Prices rise and fall in a free market, sugar is a decontrolled sector, and prices had been lying low for years. Why deny mills a year or two of good profit growth in a cyclical industry?The government may think it has the moral right to keep prices in check. Sugar mills in India have wrung concessions from the government, in return for paying a higher price for sugar cane. Although the Rangarajan committee has advocated linking sugar cane purchase price to the price of sugar and by-products, major sugar producing states such as Uttar Pradesh have not implemented it.Mills in Uttar Pradesh are forced to pay a state-determined price. In turn, they delay payments to farmers, leading to huge arrears, resulting in a confrontation between mills and state governments. Over the past few years, the Uttar Pradesh government has given some concessions to mills.The central government too has taken a number of measures for the sector. These include levying higher import duties on sugar, making it mandatory for oil marketing companies to procure ethanol (including fixing the purchase price), soft loans and an excise duty exemption on ethanol.The idea was to give some financial support to sugar mills, and the government even looked the other way as sugar prices rose. The government asked sugar mills to export 4 mt of sugar by September 2016. The money realized was to be used to cut down cane arrears and limit domestic supply. However, exports have been below targeted levels as domestic prices were higher. That is unlikely to have gone down well with the government. Rising sugar prices are a bigger pain. People will complain, state elections are under way and it could push up inflation as well. Maybe, the government is only sounding a warning and does not actually intend to impose stock limits. If sugar prices cool down, it may hold back. Otherwise, stock limits are just one weapon in its arsenal.In the past, the government has come down heavily on rising sugar prices. It can do so again.

-0.21,"Infosys Ltds former top official T.V. Mohandas Pai has set the cat among the pigeons by asking why everybody is singling out Kingfisher Airlines Ltd for the losses caused to the public exchequer when Air India has arguably been a bottomless pit for public funds.
				   
				Kingfisher Airlines was grounded at the end of 2012. Lets take a look at how Air India and Kingfisher  stack up (over a three-year period till 2013). The details are in the accompanying table.The table shows Kingfishers loss after tax rose to Rs.4,300 crore for 2012-13 from Rs.1,027 crore in 2010-11. Sure, Air India shows a decline in loss during the same period. But its loss of about Rs.5,500 crore for 2012-13 was 27% higher than that of Kingfisher.Now consider the debt figures. As on 31 March 2013, Air Indias total debt (long-term borrowings plus short-term borrowings) was an enormous Rs.47,328 crore, while Kingfishers debt was Rs.8,658 crore. Air Indias deterioration in net worth is higher than Kingfishers in this period.According to its 2012-13 annual report, Kingfishers accumulated losses at the end of the year stood at Rs.16,024 crore. News reports peg Air Indias accumulated losses in the same period at over Rs.30,000 crore. Clearly, Air Indias financials were far worse than that of Kingfishers, and there has been little improvement so far.True, theres a difference between Kingfisher Airlines and Air India in the sense that nobody has alleged any fraud in the public sector airline. But the fact remains that the amount of public funds lost so far in Air India is higher than that lost on account of Kingfisher. True, it is conceivable that Air India may turn the corner, but it is also possible that it may continue to incur losses in future.How is the governments attitude to Air India any different from that of the bankers to Kingfisher who continued to support an enterprise whose net worth had been wiped out in the hope that it would turn around? Is it fair for private sector airlines if the government continues to throw good money after bad in Air India? And how exactly does its cavalier attitude to Air Indias losses fit in with the prime ministers professed policy of minimum government?",2016-03-15,jh07d17ZMdWLkCruORzLwM,"How is government attitude to Air India any different from that of bankers who continued to support an enterprise whose net worth had been wiped out in the hope that it would turn around?

				In his budget speech, Jaitley said full electrification of 18,452 villages identified in 2015 will be achieved by 1 March 2018, for which Rs4,814 crore will be spent in the next financial year, a 43%jump from what is estimated to have spent this fiscal. Of this, so far, close to 12,000 villages have been electrified.Jaitly announced setting up of 20 GW of solar power capacity and feeding 7,000 railway stations with solar power, giving a major impetus to the shift to clean energy. Over the last two years, the share of solar power in the countys energy mix has been gradually increasing, while that of thermal power has been declining. As on 31 December, thermal power capacity accounts for 69% of the countrys 310 gigawatt (GW) power generation capacity, while solar power account for 2.7%.Also read:Union Budget 2017: Key highlightsSolar energy, with the help of government policies and the falling global prices, is now at an inflection point where it can compete on its own against other forms of energy, said Sanjeev Aggarwal, managing director and chief executive of Amplus Energy Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Two new strategic oil reserves announced will be built in Odisha and Rajasthan, Jaitley said. India has already built underground crude oil storage capacities at three locationsVishakhapatnam, Mangalore and Padur with a total 5.3 million tonne capacity. The facility at Vishakhapatnam has already been filled up and half of the Mangalore storage facility has been filled. India in January signed a deal with the United Arab Emirates for filling the rest of the facility at Mangalore. The idea is to have enough oil reserves in case of any disruption in crude oil supplies to the country in the event of any geopolitical tension. Oil refiners like Indian Oil Corp. have inventory sufficient to meet three weeks of demand. Jaitley also cut import duty on LNG from 5% to 2.5% and on solar tempered glass that goes into manufacturing of solar cells, panels and modules from 5% to zero. Also, materials that go into making such glass will now attract countervailing duty at 6% compared to 12.5% earlier. Machinery used in generating power using natural gas without combustion employing fuel cell technology has also been given import duty relief with the idea of promoting clean energy use in the economy. Dev Arora, founder & chief executive officer of 8minutes Future Energy Pvt Ltd, a solar power company said the move to reduce import duty on solar tempered glass will help improve cost efficiency in manufacturing of key solar equipment like solar cells, panels and modules and enable companies to reduce capital costs, which will ultimately benefit the consumer.",2017-02-01,jmeTMQYkdO9HHoktcPSSgK,"In his budget speech, Arun Jaitley said full electrification of 18,452 villages identified in 2015 will be achieved by 1 March  2018",both,14:37,Union Budget 2017: Arun Jaitley focuses on clean power and energy security
-0.92,"When state-owned Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) recently signed an agreement to raise a dollar-denominated loan of $400 million from a consortium of Singapores DBS Bank Ltd and State Bank of India (SBI), it demolished an argument that the existing management structure of 11 of 12 government-owned ports doesnt allow them to access cheaper external loans.
				   
				This was one of the main arguments put forth by the government since early 2000 to change the management structure of the 11 ports.These 11 ports, also called major ports located in Chennai, Kochi, Navi Mumbai, Kandla, Kolkata, Mumbai, New Mangalore, Mormugao, Paradip, Thoothukudi and Visakhapatnam function as trusts under a law framed more than five decades ago called the Major Port Trusts (MPT) Act 1963.Kamarajar Port Ltd is the only exception. Kamarajar, which runs the port at Ennore near Chennai, was formed as a firm under the Companies Act 1956 when it was opened in 2001.Under the restrictive ambit of the MPT Act, the major ports are finding it difficult to operate in a highly competitive environment and respond to market challenges, according to Indias shipping ministry.This argument was also used to explain, among other things, why major ports were underperforming when compared with their private-sector counterparts.The fact is that none of the major ports, including a corporate port such as Kamarajar, attempted to raise external commercial borrowings in the past, though some of them did take loans from the domestic market.It was Nitin Gadkari, Indias shipping minister, who showed that this can be done.Gadkari argued that the dozen ports can use their dollar earnings to borrow money at cheaper rates from overseas, instead of availing high-cost rupee loans at interest rates of 12-14% from the domestic market.The plan was first put to test for a road widening project linking JN Port for faster evacuation of cargo.Six banksICICI Bank Ltd, EXIM Bank, Deutsche Bank AG, Citibank NA, DBS Bank and SBIhad also submitted quotations for the loan to be split in two tranches with tenures of seven-and-a-half years and 10 years.The mandate was finally given to SBI and DBS Bank. JN Port will raise $300 million from SBI and $100 million from DBS at rates under 4%. JN Port will service the loan from its dollar earnings.However, there is a small hitch here.Vessel-related charges, or so-called marine charges, such as port dues, berth hire and pilotage, are paid by ships calling at a port. Vessel-related charges for foreign-going vessels are denominated in dollars, but collected in rupees after applying the prevailing exchange rate, according to a practice followed since 1991.Cargo-related charges at ports such as wharfage, crane hire, storage, warehouse, demurrage and estate rentals are denominated and collected in rupees.JN Port has sought approval from the government and the Reserve Bank of India to also collect the vessel-related charges in dollars during the loan repayment period to hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates.JN Ports success in raising a dollar-denominated loan could prod other major ports to look at this avenue to raise cheaper funds for expansion. Cheaper loans will improve the viability of projects and fetch better returns.The major ports have been increasingly losing market share to new-generation private ports. In the year ended March 2016, the 12 ports loaded 606.374 million tonnes (mt) of cargo, accounting for about 55% of Indias external trade by volume shipped by sea.The dollar loan borrowed by JN Port also goes to show that operational improvements and competitiveness can be brought about without changing the structure if there is political will and support from port workers. In fact, this has already started manifesting itself. The combined operating income of the major ports rose 8% from Rs.10,190 crore in 2014-15 to Rs.10,961 crore in 2015-16. Their operating surplus rose 19% from Rs.3,593 crore in 2014-15 to Rs.4,268 crore in 2015-16. Operating margin increased from 35% in 2014-15 to 39% in 2015-16. The profit margin of the 12 ports improved from 27% during 2013-14 to 39% in 2015-16. The improvement is due to an overall reduction in the average turnaround time of ships (time taken by ships to berth, unload cargo and sail off) calling at the major ports. In ports such as Paradip, V.O. Chidambaranar and Visakhapatnam, the average turnaround time was cut by over 40%. These operational efficiencies and improvements can be used as a bargaining tool by port workers to stall a government plan to undertake structural reform of the major port trusts and convert them into companies. The plan involves bringing the 11 port trusts under a new law called the Major Port Authorities Act, which will have provisions to undertake this task.P.

-0.24,"New Delhi: The move to sell land owned by airports across the country is likely to bring windfall gains for real estate developers and  lift the valuations of existing airport operators, analysts say.
				   
				The government in the Union budget presented on Wednesday said the Airports Authority of India (AAI) Act will be amended to enable effective monetization of land assets and that the money thus raised would be used to upgrade airports.In essence, AAI, which owns most of the countrys 125 airports and holds 50,000 acres of urban airport land, will now be able to change its land usage policy. So far, airports were allowed to use their land only for airport-related activities such as car parking and hotels.  Now they can also sell land developers who want to build multiplexes, shopping malls and convention halls. Monetization of land would require some significant changes in the Airports Authority of India Act. For example, the demand in the market is for multiplexes, shopping malls, convention centers. But the AAI Act allows us to monetize airport land by sale and lease for very limited purposes. The proposed amendment will make us in tune with the market, AAI chairman Guruprasad Mohapatra said. The move will also help GMR Infrastructure Ltd-run Delhi airport and GVK Power and Infrastructure Ltd-operated Mumbai airport to improve their valuations. Both airports are on lease from AAI for 30 years, extendable by another 30. Delhi airport has 5,000 acres of land and Mumbai airport has about 2,000 acres. Both firms have indicated they would like to sell stakes to reduce debt and aviation consulting firm CAPA said in a September report that it expects GMR and GVK divestments could pave the way for leading foreign groups to enter the Indian market. Recently, Delhi airport also gave out 200,000 sq. m of space to Bharti Realty Holdings to build what will be one of Indias largest shopping malls.GMR and GVK declined to comment. At the time, the airport had some concerns on whether this could be questioned later.In effect this new move legalises this, said a person familiar with the development, declining to be named.  It will certainly help valuations. In the first phase of airport development, Delhi airport had leased out 45 acres of land to build hotels and raised Rs1,471 crore in upfront fees to fund the Rs13,000 crore airport modernization plan.An AAI official who did not want to be named said private-sector companies have been lobbying the government for the move to change the land-use policy for several years. The private sector was very keen on change of land usage. This matter was not being allowed for a long time, this official said. The real benefit will come to Delhi and Mumbai airports as they are within the city and have big land bank. Thats the whole play. The 350-acre Safdarjung Airport complex in the heart of the capital, which also houses the aviation ministry and the AAI headquarters, has long been eyed by commercial developers, but comes under a high-security zone. The airport is used only for VIP flights, including those by the prime minister.A top government official previously with the aviation ministry said he worries about the land and long-term impact on AAI. AAI has been monetizing it for a long time by leasing the lands out on a consideration of land rent or revenue share. What is new in this? I understand that the proposal is to sell the lands to real estate developers. Some friendly developers will be able to buy the land. AAI will get one-time income and be satisfied with it, he said, declining to be named. If the intention is to wind up AAI as fast as possible, it appears the right strategy.",2017-02-03,jvKOk3nXCDNtjCeheaS1JO,Budget proposal on modification of land-use policy under AAI Act likely to lift valuations for existing airport operators,competitor,01:45,"Monetization of airport land may bring windfall for operators, builders"

				The company, owned by Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd, had posted a net profit of Rs68.5 crore for the third quarter of 2015-16. Total operating revenue grew 2.4% to Rs748 crore from Rs730 crore a year earlier, following the demonetisation of high currency notes by the government in November.Limited cash supply made people defer their DTH recharges by a few days or weeks depending on the urgency of other basic necessities, Jawahar Goel, chairman and managing director of Dish TV said in a statement.Goel said the impact was stronger in towns and cities in the second tier and below, as the economy in these areas mostly ran on cash. Our subscription revenues during the quarter could have been higher by around 8% in a non-adverse scenario, he said.Subscription revenue grew 3.3% to Rs692.1 crore from Rs669.9 crore in 2015-16.

-0.03,"Since the start of fiscal 2017, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Ltd shares have lost a fifth of their value. The companys financial performance has been hit by supply constraints in FY16 and some of that has continued into FY17 as well. Price controls have hurt too. These are expected to taper from FY17 onwards, however.
				   
				In the June quarter, sales grew by 8% to Rs.685 crore, but price cuts took away Rs.20 crore in sales, and supply constraints took away Rs.55 crore, disclosed the management in its annual analyst meet this week. In the 12 months ended March 2016, these constraints ate up Rs.350 crore worth of sales. The shortfall is blamed on shortages of vaccine supplies by the parent and a shortfall in active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) supply for Neosporin (an anti-infective). An API is the main ingredient used to make a formulation.These constraints are easing in FY17 and will go away by the end of the fiscal year, according to a post-analyst meet note by Nomura Research. That should see sales growth recover progressively, with a low-base helping too. On the price control front, 23% of GSK Pharmas sales in FY16 are in the essential list that is subject to price control. It expects little impact from the new additions to the list. But the price cuts for FY17 could see Rs.100 crore worth of sales (4% of previous years sales) getting affected, according to Nomura.GSK Pharma is investing sizeable sums in expanding capacity. Its existing factory in Nashik has been upgraded and a new Rs.1,000 crore facility is being built in Karnataka. The new facility will be commissioned by end-FY17 or early-FY18 and should double capacity. This capacity will play a key role in driving the companys growth in existing products while new ones will play their role tooit has launches planned in respiratory, diabetes and vaccines segments in the next three years. It will also minimize its exposure to drugs under price control.The presentation does paint a picture of a company readying for a growth push and GSK Pharma has also indicated that margins will get back to the 18-20% levels in the next two-three years, according to Nomura. The start-up of the new factory may hit margins in the near term, till it stabilizes and reaches optimal capacity levels.If all goes according to plan, one should see GSK Pharmas sales growth recover in the current fiscal year and beyond. The fall in its share price then raises the question if a bounce can be around the corner. Nomura does not think so, maintaining a reduce rating on the stock, citing its valuation of 59 times its price-to-earnings ratio based on FY17 projected earnings.

-0.25,"Singapore: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds entry into the telecom space is set to change the composition of the Indian economy, and its impact will be felt across all sectors, and investors should look at companies that are set to benefit from this communications revolution, said Mark Mobius, executive chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets Group at Franklin Templeton Investments.
				   
				Mobius, who oversees the Templeton research team based in 18 global emerging markets offices, said he would give high marks for the performance of the Narendra Modi government so far. He cautioned that after  the passage of reforms, the focus would shift to implementation.We have got to see implementation of those reforms so that the economy can grow and accelerate and continue on the high growth rate. So, I would say India offers an opportunity and a pitfall, and we have to keep an eye out for it, he added in an interview.Edited excerpts: India has recently seen three big reforms over the past few monthsthe goods and services tax, a relaxation in foreign direct investment norms and the bankruptcy law being passed. As an investor, how do you view these steps? Are these the last of the big reforms from the Modi government?All those steps are very good and the tax one is excellent. Now, what has to be done is implementation, because implementation with each state is really the key going forward. So, we have to look and see how fast implementation can take place, because that will determine the success of this reform. But, we are very excited about these changes, and the impact, of course, will be far-reaching, and will really be very dramatic going forward. Thats really the key, because we must not overlook the fact that implementation is probably more difficult. Getting passed in Parliament is one thing, but getting each state to implement it, to reduce the bureaucracy, to make things more efficientthat is really the key to success.The perception among investors outside is that the Indian markets are expensive. We are very excited about the Indian market. If you look at global firms, youll notice that India rating has been increasing. We are definitely very focused on India. Growth rate is very high, and we believe that this will continue with the reforms that we have seen, and so we are quite excited about it.Which are the sectors in the Indian market that you are excited about?First one, of course, is techsoftware, in particular, is very good for us. Secondly, it is the consumer sector and, particularly with the tax reform, I believe that the consumer sector will really surge ahead. Also, the companies and industries that will benefit from the revolution in communications with RILs (Reliance Industries Ltds) entry into telecoms, they are going to make telecommunicationsdatacheaper for everyone in India. This will set off a revolution in innovation and, I believe, companies that can benefit from that will really be the ones that you would want to look at. A lot of that will be consumer-oriented.How do you see RILs entry into telecoms? Will it be a game changer?No question about it. It is going to be a game changer. By bringing down the cost of the telecoms, and by enabling people to utilize telecommunications in a bigger way, cheaper, faster and more efficient way, the entire composition of the economy will change. This goes for the financial sector, it goes for the consumer sector, even goes for the industrial sectorso, everybody will be impacted by this. Its true that the competition has been hurt temporarily with RILs entry, but I think they will step up to the plate and be ready to compete.Which sectors in the Indian market should one avoid at this time?I think it is not avoidbut we have to be very cautious when it comes to the finance sector. As I mentioned, the changes that telecommunications and mobile will bring about to banking and transfer of moneythat is going to have a big impact on the financial sector. Those financial sector companies that are not able to keep up, they will be at a disadvantage. The other area is the companies that have benefited from the restrictionsstate restrictions, border control restrictions, tax restrictionsthese companies are going to be impacted soon, and we have to be very careful. Again, the companies which had state monopolies in certain areas because of the inability of competitors to come inthose companies are going to be impacted, too. So, we have to be careful about not picking these companies. Recently, in your blog, you had said while India is growing faster than China, the latter continues to be your top bet among emerging markets.Thats mainly because of the size of China. You have a lot of liquid and large companies in the China market, and access is easy through the Hong Kong market, which enables us to get in and out of Chinese companies. However, with these reforms in India, you will see the rating on India increase. If you see our global funds, you will see that happening already.Overall, how worried or optimistic are you on China?I am pretty optimistic about China. I know people are concerned about the debt, about the leverage, etc., but at the end of the day, it is a communist-controlled society, and they can control the heavy leverage that a lot of the companies have. As you know, the big banks and big companies there are all controlled by the government... Its a big economygrowth is continuing not only because of government spending, but also because of private sector growth. So, were optimistic. But in a country like that, just like in India, there will be winners and losers. We have to be very careful in stock selection.In a recent blog, you said that in 2016, emerging markets have outperformed developed markets in US dollar terms. What is your take on the mid-term and long-term performance of emerging markets equities when compared with the developed markets?In the long term, there is no question that emerging markets will outperform for the simple reason that economic growth in emerging markets will continue to be at least double that of the developed countries. So, as long as that is the case, we can expect emerging markets to outperform. If you look at history, there is a correlation between market performance and economic growth. So, thats an important point to keep in mind. The other thing is that there is a slew of frontier marketscountries that are just starting out in the market economy adventure and these companies and countries will be growing at a very fast pace because theyre starting from a low base. That also will boost emerging markets generally.How do you see the emerging markets being impacted by the gradual increase in US interest rates?Its very important to look at the history of interest rates and emerging markets performance. If you compare the US Feds funds rate against the emerging markets performance, there is no real correlation. For example, the period between 1988 and 1993, interest rates went down and the emerging markets went up. Everybody expects a correlation between interest rates and performance; but then, if you look at the period from 2003 to 2007, interest rates went up and the emerging markets boomed. From 2007-09, the correlation held because interest rates went down and the emerging markets went down. So, its different from what you would expect. I think people are putting too much weight on the interest rate, particularly the US Federal Reserve rate and what the markets will do. There is a good chance that if the US Fed raises the interest rate, then emerging markets could outperform. You just cannot say that when interest rates go up, the market goes down. It doesnt work that way. History shows thats not the case.How do you rate the performance of the Modi government so far? Do you think it has delivered on many of its promises in terms of reforms, in terms of ease of doing business?I think there was too much euphoria when they were elected, and we foresaw that they would have difficulty in the beginning. So, we didnt expect the tremendous surge of reforms because we knew the barriers that they were facing in Parliament and so forth. However, the fact that they have been able to pass the tax reform and that they have been able to make changes is very heartening to us. To us, it indicates that the Modi government has done a pretty good job. I would have like to see (former Reserve Bank of India governor) Raghuram Rajan to stay on in the central bank. That is probably one negative to the Modi government; but then, if his successor continues on the same policies in a quiet way, then it should be OK. I would say we would give them high marks for performance.In India, what do you feel are the challenges and risks going forward?Again, it is not just the degree to which reform takes place. We have got to see implementation of those reforms so that the economy can grow and accelerate and continue on the high growth rate. So, I would say India offers an opportunity and a pitfall, and we have to keep an eye out for it.How do you see the private equity space in South-East Asia?Its very good. It is a great opportunity here in South-East Asia because there are so many new enterprises that are getting started and, of course, the impact of China on South-East Asia, in most parts, is very positive. China is, of course, the main trading partner, and as China surges ahead, these countries will be pulled along with them. So, lots of opportunities in the private sector area.",2016-09-22,kFXB0BUoKhEy9eTdD8w8JM,"Templetons emerging markets fund manager Mark Mobius says Reliance Jios launch will only  impact the telecom space, but also other sectors and the Indian economy",both,07:50,Reliance Jios entry a game changer: Mark Mobius
0.34,"State Bank of India (SBI) suffered a 32% drop in its net profit for the June quarter but still came out looking like a star because the other six public sector banks that reported their financials on Friday came out with terrible results, with five suffering huge losses.
				   
				The SBI stock ran up 7%, despite the 32% drop in its net profit to Rs.2,520.96 crore. Lets get to the good parts first. The growth in operating profit was 20.12% at Rs.11,504 crore, not to be sneezed at. In terms of provisions, fresh slippages and even operating expenses, the June quarter was better than the previous one. Total provisions dropped by 43.7%, fresh slippages or the loans that turned bad during the June quarter also dropped by a huge 70% to Rs.8,790 crore.The fact that gross bad loans rose by a modest 3.43% gives relief. It looks like much of the pain has passed, with gross non-performing assets (NPAs) at 6.94% of total loans amid declining slippages. Most now expect a further fall in slippages in the quarters ahead.The other six lenders reported gross bad loan ratios exceeding 11%.SBIs net interest income, or the core income a bank earns by giving loans, rose 4.23% to Rs.14,312.31 crore in the June quarter. Other income increased 44.16% to Rs.7,335.08 crore from Rs.5,087.98 crore in the same period last year. Indeed, we should not write off the banks performance at a time when the end of the bad loan tunnel looks even farther after other banks results.But this glow vanishes once we begin looking at the red flags. In the analyst meet after the release of the results, SBI chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya said the loan watch list still stands at Rs.31,000 crore. These are loans that the bank expects most likely to turn bad. The lender had indicated the figure of Rs.31,000 crore in the quarter ended March. Although Bhattacharya did not reiterate or give an indication as to how much of it is prone to slip, the banks most conservative estimate is 30%.In the June quarter, Rs.2,165 crore worth of slippages was from the watch list. The bank has added a similar amount this quarter and these additions come from a new territory, the international loan book. The situation is far from rosy, said Bhattacharya at the analyst meet.It is clear that other income saved the day. The 44.16% increase in other income cushioned the impact of the rise in provisions on profits. But sample this: operating profit increased by Rs.1,852 crore from a year ago, while the rise in profit on sale of investments was Rs.1,851 crore.

-0.43,"Do Nestlé India Ltds September quarter results indicate that things are back to normal after the Maggi noodles recall incident?
				   
				The September quarter should be seen as normal course of business for at least the ex-Maggi portfolio, say analysts from Kotak Institutional Equities Research. Maggi issues make a year-on-year comparison rather challenging to evaluate the companys performance. Assuming Rs500 crore worth of Maggi sales in September 2016 and Rs650 crore in the September 2014 quarter, the ex-Maggi domestic portfolio seems to have declined 3% versus the September 2014 quarter, Kotak analysts said  in a post-results report on 28 October. The brokerage firm believes comparing numbers two years back is perhaps more apt given Maggis problems last year. One can change the assumptions on Maggi sales and arrive at a conclusion that ex-Maggi sales have done better than what our math suggests; however, that would mean that Maggi revival pace is slower, says Kotak. Either way, it is not a pretty picture. Since the Maggi event, the September 2015 quarter was the worst for Nestlé India. Its net domestic sales fell to Rs1,588 crore. On that base,  net domestic sales grew 38% from a year earlier to Rs2,190 crore for the September 2016 quarter. Total operating revenue rose 35.6% to Rs2,363 crore. On a sequential basis, domestic sales increased 5% in the September quarter. But its worth noting that domestic sales had declined 2% during the June quarter compared to the March quarter. The companys operating profit margin declined a bit on a sequential basis. Net profit increased about 17% compared to the June quarter to Rs269 crore. Even as it seems that satisfactory sales growth is still some time away, Nestlé Indias investors have little to complain about. The share price has appreciated 17% so far in 2016. Hopes that Nestlé Indias sales will gain traction with the resolution of the Maggi issue have buoyed sentiments. Product launches have helped too. The firm has launched 25 new products or variants across categories in recent months. Currently, the stock trades at a pricey 57 times estimated earnings for 2016.

-1.0,"The most fundamental progress that technology has made over the past few decades is a dramatic increase in computing power coupled with a reduction in the cost of storage. Such progress has enabled us to run algorithms and code over swathes of data and at a fraction of the cost, thus yielding what some may consider more insights. Consequently, we are able to find patterns in large amounts of data. 
				   
				This, by some limited definition, is construed as intelligence and has been demonstrated in specific classes of activities such as detecting diabetes from retinal scans, driving cars, playing games, etc. In these cases, software can emulate human behaviour and perhaps even exceed human capabilities. But the fact is that we have not yet invented any new magic wand to make software think on its own or have any sense of consciousness, in the way humans do.The limitation is grounded in the fact that software still operates, for the most part, on the paradigm of Gigo (garbage in garbage out), meaning it mostly only does whatever we tell it to and is biased, based on whatever data we train it with. Give it incorrect data and it will pick up incorrect patterns.But the vision and aspiration of computer science has always been to build a machine that can accurately emulate human intelligence. However, we still have a long way to go before we can build a software system that is functionally capable the same way a human is. Software intelligence, though defined in academic circles, has been fairly misused (and misunderstood) in popular reporting, giving people the impression that software can do just about anything a human being can. This notion is fundamentally misguided. We are not there. Or at least not yet. The gap between software and the human mind is still massive.Consequently such gaps do not necessarily support claims that artificial intelligence (AI) and automation will replace hordes of jobs in the Indian IT industry and ultimately lead to mass unemployment. This industry employs provides direct employment for a few million people in India, a significant fraction of whom belong to our expanding middle class. Therefore, as various commentators have begun to call out the threat of automation to this industry there is considerable (and reasonable) fear whether the rise of machines spells doom and gloom for a section of the Indian middle class.But I do not believe we are there yet. Or at least not to the extent people fear. Automating away this labour force is not an easy task. Terms like robotic automation are not sufficient replacement for the complexity and range of tasks that this labour force performs. It is very tempting to prognosticate a future where silicon (computers) will rule supreme over carbon (humans). However, as a computer scientist, through my work and study over the past few years in the IT/technology industry and about how businesses consume technology, I have gained a genuine appreciation for the unique value and contributions human beings bring to the table in building trust and enabling businesses the world over. Automating these unique attributes with machines will necessarily require emulating the same value humans deliver in businesses.The role of professionals in the IT industry, the populace whose work is under threat from automation, has not yet been sufficiently understood nor has it been given its due credit. These professionals perform a range of activities, from understanding customers business requirements to writing code, maintaining software systems and processing transactions. Working in teams, they perform a variety of different actions touching several information systems, coordinate with each other, navigate uncertain or changing scenarios, report to their managers, take bottomline responsibilities for their respective systems, are accountable and serve customers across the globe. All these activities engender a deep sense of trust and confidence among their customers the world over.But this is also true for each individual. All humans, I argue, even in the most seemingly robotic tasks bring to bear abilities that do not make them merely robotic. Conceptually every human being has a brain stack comprised of layers that include the ability to execute deterministic tasks, intuition, experience, handling (unexpected) variations, common sense, and an ability to identify and fix the unusual. These are fundamental traits that all humans share, though, admittedly, some more than others. No matter the task each human has the potential and ability to apply these traits in any situation without necessarily being to do so a priori. It is a combination of these traits inherent to each one of us that engenders trust and confidence in us among our colleagues. All businesses run on such trust and confidence in their stakeholders  be they employees or vendors. Therefore, attempting to replace any human with a robotic system is akin to trying to hire a human being who can only ever execute deterministic tasks but lacks intuition, common sense, experience, and an ability to handle unusual situations!Hence, any attempt by intelligent software at automating all that work done by a single individual or an entire team of humans must involve recreating the same trust and confidence. This, in-turn, necessarily requires addressing the whole gamut of these activities that humans perform on a regular basis and with similar human traits, but in software.Therefore, the next stage of innovation in computer science will be not just to make software run faster but also about how to get software to emulate more human-like traits and ultimately become truly trustworthy (like humans).Rohan Murty is junior fellow at the Society of Fellows at Harvard University.This is part of a series of articles in Mints 10th anniversary special issue that look at India 10 years from now.

Gross bad loans as a percentage of total loans were 1.05 percent in the December quarter, versus 1.02 percent in the September quarter.HDFC Bank has far lower bad loans than its bigger rivals, thanks to its stronger retail business and smaller exposure to project finance.Indias banking industry has been hit by the governments shock cancellation in November of 86 percent of its currency in circulation, which forced many institutions to scramble to replace the high-value banknotes.The banking sector also continues to battle record sour assets with the regulator setting a March deadline for a clean up.Despite the banknote ban hitting credit demand in many sectors, HDFC Bank said its domestic advances as of end-December grew about 17.5 percent from a year earlier.That helped net interest income for the quarter grow 18 percent to Rs8,309 crore, HDFC Bank said.

-1.0,"The sharp pickup in Infosys Ltds revenue growth shows clearly that it has momentum on its side. Another performance metric that has got tongues wagging is the amount of large deals it has won. 
				   
				The company said last month that the total contract value of the large deals it signed last year stood at $2.79 billion, or 45% higher compared with fiscal year 2014-15. But does this mean the companys revenue growth rate will pick up as a result? Note that HCL Technologies Ltds results in the past few quarters have demonstrated adequately that large order wins do not necessarily result in faster revenue growth. According to the company, new order wins dont translate into commensurate incremental revenues because they also contribute towards making up for earlier projects that were completed.This is a moot point. JPMorgan India Pvt. Ltd said in a note to clients: A significant portion of project-based deals come up for renewal every year; (besides), ~20-25% of annuity-deals come up for renewal/backfilling. Unless technology companies such as Infosys have a high success rate with rebids, the existing base of revenues will get eroded. As such, the new large order wins will first help in plugging the gaps that arose because of completed projects, before contributing to growth.At HCL Technologies, large order wins have amounted to over $1 billion each quarter for over 12 quarters, but revenue growth has been declining. Revenue grew by 8.1% in constant currency terms in the March quarter, about half the rate at which it grew in the April-June 2015 quarter.The JPMorgan note says, The renewal pipe is critical to fill. Winning a very high percentage of renewal deals and more crucially, winning additional business from existing clients requires sound mining/farming skills, which we believe is far more important than hunting for big contracts. Of course, all of this is not to say that Infosys lacks in client mining skills. In fact, its quite likely that the increase in order wins is the result of better mining.Even so, its clearly premature to conclude that the sharp increase in the companys deal wins will be sufficient to plug the gaps that arise from completed projects, as well as contribute handsomely to future growth.",2016-05-24,mN7y9qkZCKNeLjw9jVydFN,"The sharp pickup in Infosyss revenue growth shows clearly that it has momentum on its side

-0.25,"Seattle: Microsoft Corp. unveiled a corporate team-chat service that works with its cloud-based Office and Skype products, aiming to take on Slack Technologies Inc. and Atlassian Corp.s HipChat in a growing market.
				   
				The new product is designed to facilitate real-time conversations and collaboration while maintaining and building up that institutional knowledge of a team, said chief executive officer Satya Nadella. The product has team chat, private messages and voice and videoconferencing.Big companies like Microsoft and IBM are showing renewed interest in the corporate-messaging market as customers flock to internet-based tools like Slack for setting up team communications, said Vanessa Thompson, an analyst at IDC. Microsoft relied on Office 365 and other products to rack up almost $10 billion in commercial cloud revenue for the fiscal year that ended 30 June, and is adding services to draw in more customers.Microsoft is trying to get more airtime with customers that might want something to augment their existing investment in Office 365, Thompson said. What we have started to see is a bunch of companies trying to attack the enterprise versions of WhatsApp and consumer messaging. IDC hasnt published a market size or forecast for the space, which it calls workplace application messaging.A preview of the service, dubbed Microsoft Teams, is available now for Office 365 commercial customers in some versions. It will be generally available in the first quarter and will be included in all Office 365 Enterprise and small business versions.Coordinated tasksMicrosofts product allows teams to add what its calling Tabs, to quickly link to frequently used files and applications. These tabs can relate to Microsoft products like the OneNote note-taking program or to outside productsthe company said its adding support for Zendesk and Asana soon. Teams can also bring in notifications from services like Twitter and GitHub. Like Slack, it also supports the usage of botsprograms that chat with users to automate tasks.Its not Microsofts first foray into this areathe company paid $1.2 billion in 2012 to buy Yammer Inc., but hasnt been able to build up the same kind of usage as Slack and HipChat. Slack raised $200 million at a valuation of $3.8 billion in April. The startup, which introduced its product in 2013, said it reached annualized revenue of $100 million over the summer and surpassed 1.25 million paid users. HipChat was founded in 2010 and acquired by Atlassian two years later. That company declined to break out specific numbers for the product.Microsoft said Teams tight connection with Office and ability to do more than chat give it an advantage over rivals, some of which integrate with parts of Office, but not as closely.Just creating another persistent chat tool isnt all that interesting, said Office vice president Kirk Koenigsbauer. The notion of having this hub for teamwork is a new spin on it. Its not for people who just want to have conversations.Race dayNascar racing company Hendrick Motorsports has been trying out Teams and will use it on the track at the Daytona 500 in February, said Matt Cochran, the companys information technology manager. During a race, Hendrick will use Microsofts product to coordinate pit stops and share feedback among teams supporting its four cars. For example, if one car is seeing a certain kind of wear on tires its crew can alert the other three, which have similar equipment, to make adjustments. Chat is important because the crews need information quickly while audio channels of communications are reserved for conversations between the driver and the crew chief.Hendrick was using Slack, but will switch because Teams works more smoothly with the firms existing Microsoft software and has better security, Cochran said.Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft considered acquiring Slack, but the discussions never got serious enough to involve Nadella or the companys board, and it opted instead to build its own similar software, said two people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the process wasnt public. TechCrunch reported Microsofts potential interest in Slack in March.In a very tongue-in-cheek acknowledgment of the competition, Slack took out a full-page ad in the New York Times Wednesday and posted a copy on its website welcoming Microsoft to the field and noting that all this is harder than it looks.Atlassian president Jay Simons said HipChat has an advantage by focusing purely on communicating, while Microsoft Teams is another feature intended to sell Office 365 subscriptions.The success Atlassian has had in focusing on teams has probably been a wake-up call to Microsoft, he said. On one level, you welcome the competition but on the other level, Microsoft is always a little scary because its a huge company with a lot of customers.Bloomberg Beta, the venture capital arm of Bloomberg LP, is an investor in Slack.

				Infosys Ltd is expected by at least three brokerages to scale down its full-year dollar revenue growth for the third time this year when Indias second-largest software firm declares its third quarter results on Friday.This is not surprising, considering the negative cross currency impact and also partially, on account of managements inability to give a firm guidance. Still, 2015-16 is turning out to be roller-coaster ride for Infosys chief executive officer (CEO) Vishal Sikka. Till a year ago, Sikka seemed to have settled well and appeared to be enjoying his job (from playing cricket with employees in Mysuru to the after-results parties with senior management ranks).By December, Sikka came across as a different boss, unhappy with the progress made by the company, and heard telling his colleagues how he has been unable to implement things he had planned when he took over the current job in August 2014. In April last year, Infosys projected to grow at-best at 13.8%; now it will end the year in March with a less than 8% revenue expansion.Agreed, falling growth at Infosys mirrors the problems faced by the industry at-large: Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. scaled down its full-year growth on three times last year, and will grow at 9%. However, slow business from clients is just one area of concern. A bigger challenge is that, bit by bit, Infosys early turnaround plans put in place in January 2015, seem to be fizzling out. Retaining senior management is another headache for Sikka. Although overall attrition continues to be stable, five executive vice presidents (EVPs) left Infosys last year, compared to three EVP departures in the first 17 months of Sikkas tenure (1 August 201431 December 2015).Also read: Five things to watch for in TCS Q3 results tomorrowSikkas record to make the company future-ready, by having $2 billion from newer technologies and platforms, and another $1.5 billion from mergers and acquisitions and finally by improving its revenue per employee to $80,000 by March 2021, is patchy at best. This is not to pooh-pooh Sikkas efforts; he has tried his best till now. But Sikkas best seems to have not made a dent in an insular organisation like Infosys. How can Infosys embrace the new technologies if it shies away from acquisitions (Infosys has not made a single acquisition in the last 15 months)? During this time, Wipro Ltd spent over a $1 billion in buying companies. Most worrying is that despite Sikkaa repeated missives to employee to shape-up and embrace automation platforms in projects and learn newer skill sets, Infosyss revenue per employee refuses to improve. Finally, assuaging investor concerns, many of whom are now getting jumpy over some of the founders reported unhappiness with the CEO, is a big challenge. Despite Infosys estimated to grow faster than Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) in the current year, Infosys shares were down 8.4% as against a 7.7% decline in IT index last year. Infosys shareholders increased their wealth by 32.3% (as against a 14.21% return made in IT Index) in the period between 1 August 2014 and 31 December 2015.With this as the backdrop, Mint brings to you five things to watch out for when Infosys declares its earnings on Friday:Revenue forecast: Brokerage BNP Paribas sees Infosys recording a 1.5% sequential decline in dollar revenue (declining 0.5% in constant currency terms) at $2.55 billion for the October-December period. Management is further expected to narrow its full-year dollar revenue growth to less than 8%. This could set alarm bells ringing for investors as this suggests that Sikkas new measures to turnaround the company are taking longer than earlier expected.Senior management exits and steps management is taking to arrest attrition: A bigger headache for Sikka in this financial year is turning out to be the departure among senior management ranks. Exits of senior employees is leading to poor execution, a reason Sikka has conceded in the past behind companys underperformance.Where is the new in old Infosys? To Sikkas credit, Infosys over the last few years has hired people in the areas of artificial intelligence and pushed to embrace automation platforms. But the proof of the pudding is if indeed Infosys has been able to deploy some of these technologies to either improve its profitability or win business from newer companies which are acting as agents of disruption. Has Infosys won any business from companies like Uber or Airbnb or Facebook? It is over two years since Infosys first detailed its ambition of becoming a $20 billion firm by March 2021, and yet the management shies away from disclosing the progress made from monetising platforms.What is the challenge in translating business from large deal wins? Infosys under Sikka has significantly improved its large deal wins in a quarter ($809 million in April-June period and over $1 billion in the July-September period). For some unexplainable reason, this improved deal win is not translating into growth. Management clarity on this theme will be important.Infosys Consulting, BPO and Edgeverve continue to remain weak: Since August 2014, EdgeVerve and Infosys BPO units continue to underperform. Together, both accounted for a little over 13% of its $9.5 billion revenue last year. Infosys consulting was the third weak area at the beginning of this financial year.

				The company said net profit rose to Rs1,744.5 crore in the three months ended December, from Rs1,183 crore a year ago. It narrowly missed the Rs1,770 crore estimate based on the average of 28 analysts polled by Bloomberg. Net sales grew to Rs19,173 crore from Rs16,957 crore a year ago. In a statement, Maruti attributed the performance to the increase in the market share of its larger and premium models, lower sales and marketing expenses, cost reduction initiatives and higher non-operational income. This was partially offset by the increase in commodity prices and adverse foreign exchange movement during the quarter, it added.Maruti sold a total of 387,251 vehicles in the third quarter, a growth of 3.5% over the same period a year ago. Of this, exports stood at 30,748 units.Marutis sales numbers come in the backdrop of the 8 November withdrawal of high-value currency notes that triggered a cash crunch and prompted many prospective customers to defer purchases.

-0.25,"The anonymity of bitcoin gained its myriad adherents among anarchists and drug dealers around the world. Now, though, its looking like the digital currency isnt quite anonymous enough.
				   
				Consider the sudden popularity of Zcash and Monero, two new cryptocurrencies that offer confidential transactions. When Zcash first became available last week, demand was so strong that its founders temporarily became paper billionaires. Monero rose to fame after a popular marketplace in the dark webthe portion of the Internet where people sell everything from guns to hacking toolsadded it as a payment option. The newcomers sense opportunity in one of bitcoins flaws: Analytics companiesfueled by government research grantshave gotten really good at exposing users identities, which were supposed to be hidden by public keys that reduced them to a mere string of numbers and letters. This is possible because all transactions are recorded in a permanent public ledger, allowing anyone to see the entire history of each bitcoin and all the activity of each account. A single payment to an online retailer can be enough to reveal a users identity, which in turn reveals everything that person has done with that account.In other words, the same transparency that guarantees the validity of bitcoin transactions also allows people to find out whether a users bitcoin previously passed through dirty hands. Such information is both an asset and a liability. Its useful for helping service providers make informed decisions about whether they want someone as a customer, but it can come with the responsibility of having to screen those customers to stay on the right side of the law. The US government, for example, has outsourced some of its crime-fighting job by requiring financial institutionsincluding digital currency exchangesto enforce anti-money-laundering regulations. Drug-dealing and tax evasion can be tough to stop at the source, but the perpetrators typically have to move money, so banks and exchanges are in a good position to identify and report illicit activity.On the surface, privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies seem designed precisely to undermine such controls. Monero mixes multiple transactions together so that a source cannot be directly linked to a destination. Zcash creates shielded transactions where everything is hidden except for a string of data that proves the transaction is valid. Bitcoin also plans to add some of these features in the near future.As bad as it looks, though, developers arent creating anonymous payment systems because they want to help criminals evade the law. Theyre doing it because thats the only way a decentralised currency can work. If, say, users have to evaluate the acceptability of each bitcoin based on its transaction history, then one coin can be worth more than another and the currency loses its reason for existence.The dollar is successful because its pretty much always worth a dollar, backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. Thats true whether its freshly printed or old and torn, whether it has a pristine history or has passed through the hands of Al Capone. A publicly controlled digital currency doesnt have that legal tender status and probably never will, so it must find some other way to achieve the same fungibility.Anonymity achieves this by preventing merchants or service providers from seeing any blemishes that might prevent them from honouring a unit of currency. Reducing the opportunity for external judgment is pretty much the goal of privacy protection in general. Ideally, so little information is revealed that everyoneand every valid transactionis treated equally.Decentralised currencies arose because people wanted to transact in a digital world without having to ask permission. The extent to which this facilitates criminal activity depends entirely on the prevalence of criminal activity in the real world. Maybe thats a problem that needs to be addressed outside the monetary system.

				The plant in Odishas Angul district has so far received competing offers from Singapores SembCorp, Adani Power and JSW Energy, one of the three people cited above said, requesting anonymity.The sell side mandate was given to EY around three months ago following which SembCorp has made an upfront cash offer of close to Rs1,600 crore for the equity component of the project, said the person cited above.JSW and Adani have offered a higher price of more than Rs2,000 crore, but the offer involves an upfront cash payment of around Rs500 crore to Rs600 crore towards equity and the remaining upon fulfilment of certain conditions linked to singing of power purchase agreements and coal linkages, the person said.JSW is keen to replicate the same structure it followed while buying JSPLs (Naveen Jindal-led Jindal Steel and Power Ltds) 1,000MW thermal unit this year, where it paid Rs500 crore cash advance while tying up the rest of the payment to pre-defined conditions regarding fuel security and power offtake, the person added. Emails sent to Adani group, SembCorp and EY did not elicit any response at the time of going to press.A JSW Energy spokesperson denied that the company is in talks to buy the asset.Your query is completely speculative and baseless. The company reiterates that there is no truth and categorically deny any discussion by JSW Energy with them, the spokesperson said.JITPL is controlled by listed firms Jindal Poly Investments Ltd (JPIL) and Jindal Photo Ltd (JPL) through Jindal India Powertech Ltd, a holding company owned by JPIL and JPL.The promoters have been in talks to sell the unit in the past too, but a deal did not materialize due to valuation mismatches. However, things are likely to be different this time because JITPL needs some immediate cash infusion to pay lenders and is already behind its repayment schedule, the second person said, also declining to be named.Also, a section of minority shareholders want the promoters to divest from power and focus on the core poly films business, the person added.An email sent to JITPL and BC Jindal group did not receive a response.The Angul project was completed at a cost of Rs7,537 crore with overall debt of Rs5,900 crore and an equity of Rs1,637 crore.Industry analysts said that if the SembCorp offer is accepted, JIPL and JPL could get Rs600 crore and Rs160 crore, respectively, of the proceeds and another Rs685 crore to Jindal Poly Films Ltd, the listed operating entity of the group.JITPL currently has long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) for 256MW capacity (156MW with Odisha Gridco and 100MW with Kerala State Electricity Board Ltd) and has also executed a 12-year PPA with Tata Power Trading Corp. Ltd (TPTCL) for a capacity of up to 900MW at a guaranteed base tariff of Rs2.70 per unit.Concerns over fuel supplies, high interest cost and absence of long-term PPAs among thermal power producers in India has led to distress among several power companies and has led to many assets changing hands.In July, Sajjan Jindal-promoted JSW signed a definitive agreement to acquire Jaiprakash Power Ventures 500MW thermal plant at Bina in Madhya Pradesh at base enterprise value of Rs2,700 crore.

				Chandra and I have done more than $4 billion in business in over a decade we have known (each other), Habib said days after Chandrasekaran, the chief executive officer (CEO) of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) was appointed chairman of Tata Sons Ltd.Put simply, over the years, Chandrasekaran got 66-year-old Habib to give TCS as much business as Indias fifth largest outsourcing company, Tech Mahindra Ltd, earned in revenue last year$4.04 billion.TCS ended last year with $16.5 billion in revenue.I remember once while I was COO (chief operating officer) at Nielsen, we had some trouble with two very important clients, P&G (Procter and Gamble Co.) and Kraft (Foods Group Inc.), said Habib, who now runs his own consulting firm, FCM. P&G believed that they did not need Nielsen as a provider because we were perceived to be not a technology leader. I had a discussion around this with Chandra, and he flew with our CEO and me to Cincinnati, to meet the CIO (chief information officer) of P&G. Chandra personally assured P&G and gave his personal commitment, under which he promised to have oversight, and provided TCSs resources to an industry-changing project. We retained P&G with his support and leadership. But had we lost P&G, it would have had a huge impact on us. So, this is the kind of commitment that underlines the importance Chandra gives to its (TCSs) customers.Chandrasekarans focus on building client engagement is one benchmark CEOs, including his successor Rajesh Gopinathan, will find impossible to match.Gopinathan, who is currently the chief financial officer, will take over as boss from 21 February. However, TCS executives believe that building client engagements will be the least of the worries for Gopinathan in the coming 12-24 months.Chandra will not let go of TCS. So, he will be there to mentor and help Gopinathan, said the first executive.Even by the outsourcing industrys penny-pinching ways, Gopinathan stands out.When most of TCSs rivals are seeing a drop in profitability, Gopinathan has managed to make TCS, with a 26% operating margin, the most profitable outsourcing company globally.Yet, Gopinathan takes over a very different TCS than the one Chandrasekaran inherited in 2009.At 45, Gopinathan is only a year younger than Chandrasekaran when the latter took over TCSs helm in 2009.TCS then was a 142,000-strong company, which had crossed $6 billion in revenue. Eight years later, in 2017, TCS is the countrys largest private-sector employer with over 378,000 employees. Managing a ship of this scale is not easy. Then TCS still had a lot of business to make from deploying engineers to write software codes and roll out ERP (enterprise resource planning software such as SAP), provide customer support, and maintain data centres for Fortune 1000 companies.Now, cloud-computing providers such as Amazon Web Services are eating into the business of TCS and other outsourcing companies. Automation and artificial intelligence technologies pose an existential threat to the way traditional outsourcing companies have done business.Finally, newer technologies such as block chain mean hundreds of thousands of engineers at TCS need to learn, build and offer solutions quickly to its clients.That Gopinathan will have his task cut out is an understatement.

				Infosys cut its full-year dollar revenue forecast for the second time this fiscal, and now expects to grow between 8.2 and 9.2%, and 8-9% in constant currency terms.The sharp cut in FY17 USD revenue growth guidance, despite the recovery in growth momentum in 2QFY17, reflects a shift to a conservative approach on guidance after two successive cuts on the aggressive stance adopted at FY17-start, Pankaj Kapoor, director of India IT services and software equity research at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, wrote in a note. Chief executive officer Vishal Sikka said Infosys was scaling back its growth target because it had performed poorly in the first quarter and on account of near-term uncertainties.Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., which has most of its employees in India, has also cut its revenue growth forecast twice and expects to grow at 8.5-9.5% in 2016. Cognizant follows the calendar year. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Indias largest software services firm, does not give forecasts, but after it reported a poor 0.3% sequential dollar revenue growth on Thursday, it will be a tall task for the company to better the growth rate of 7.1% reported last fiscal year.Worryingly for both Infosys and TCS, it is not just sluggish revenue growth which is of concern. Both firms sounded less confident of maintaining profitability, with Infosys conceding that operating margin may be below its stated range of 25-26%.Infosyss sharp downward revision from the first growth outlook of between 11.8% and 13.8% dollar revenue expansion in April means that Infosys has shaved off $440 million in business from its first projection of adding $1.31 billion in incremental revenue this year. For Infosys, an at-best 9.2% growth means it expects to do $870 million in new business this year compared to $790 million last year.Infosys Ltd shares ended the day 2.53% lower at Rs1,025.70 on NSE even as the Nifty index rose 0.12% to 8,583.40 points.ALSO READ | Is Infosys being overly conservative with its guidance?Infosys said on Friday that revenue for the three months ended 30 September improved 3.5% to $2.58 billion from $2.5 billion in the preceding quarter. This was on account of the company partially recording $20 million in business from the Goods Services and Tax Network project, and a 4.5% growth in business from clients in banking and financial services segment.In constant currency terms, revenue grew 3.9% sequentially. Net profit rose 5.5% to $539 million from $511 million in the April-June period as the company deployed fewer people at expensive overseas client sites. A Bloomberg survey of analysts expected Infosys to report revenue of $2.58 billion and profit of $529.81 million in the September quarter.Operating margin expanded 80 basis points to 24.9% at the end of the September quarter, compared with 24.1% at the end of June. There are a couple of heartening takeaways in Infosyss performance during the second quarter, say analysts. First, a 4.6% sequential increase in business from banking clients suggests that Infosys may be winning customers at the expense of other large technology vendors.Second, Infosys reported over $1.2 billion in large deal wins during this quarter. This means that in little less than 18 months, Infosys has managed to increase its large deal wins from a little over $400 million a quarter to $1.2 billion.Analysts at Citibank said in a note after Infosys declared its earnings that fairly all-round growth in key geographies and verticalsbetter than what peer TCS reported is another positive for the company. The US business, which brings 61.5% of Infosyss revenue, improved 2.6% sequentially, while business from India, which accounts for 3.4% of overall revenue, jumped 29.1%.The company added 78 new clients in the second quarter, taking the total number of customers to 1,136.

0.36,"A $13 billion deal involving Russia in India threatens to weaken the grip of Middle East crude suppliers in the worlds fastest growing oil market.
				   
				Rosneft PJSC is part of a group of investors that beat suitors from Saudi Arabia and Iran to buy Essar Oil Ltds Vadinar refinery, Indias second-biggest, in a deal announced over the weekend. Russias largest oil producer is following a strategy by resource-rich firms and nations to secure outlets for their output, and may supply the facility with Venezuela crude and challenge Middle East exporters that provide about two-thirds of the countrys imports.India will be the most important product-growth market over the next 25 years, making it important to Russia, according to Neil Beveridge, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.With the Essar deal, Rosneft is targeting a market of 1.3 billion people that imports more than 80% of its crude requirements and which is forecast by the International Energy Agency to be the worlds fastest-growing oil consuming nation through 2040. The country has emerged as a bright spot for global demand as the quickest economic expansion among major economies spurs increased use of trucks, cars and motorbikes.Market accessThe transaction also includes about 2,700 Essar Oil retail stations, a market that has attracted top oil companies such Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc. Most of Essars output is sold domestically, either through its own outlets or to government-owned fuel retailers.The access to the Indian market attracted Rosneft the most, Prashant Ruia, chairman of Essar Oil, said in an interview in Mumbai on Sunday. It is one of the worlds largest markets. They wanted to have a piece of the market.Also read: Engineers India, Gazprom to prepare India-Russia gas pipeline blueprintRosneft also sees the potential to expand in the Asia-Pacific region by supplying fuels to Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Australia, it said in a statement.The deal will enable Russia to have greater influence over the Asian market, said Abhishek Kumar, an analyst at InterfaxEnergys Global Gas Analytics in London. This would be in response to Saudi Arabias attempts to penetrate the European market, which is dominated by Russian oil.Venezuelan crudeThe need for oil-rich nations to invest in overseas refineries to secure market share has intensified amid a global glut. Saudi Arabia is buying stakes in refiners through its state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco in countries from Indonesia to the US. Kuwait is also investing in processing facilities.Essar Oils Vadinar refinery in Gujarat can process about 400,000 barrels a day. It was designed to run on low-quality crudes from Venezuelan or the Middle East, rather than Russian grades. Venezuela made up almost half the refinerys supplies in the first six months of the year, followed by Iran, according to shipping data obtained by Bloomberg.The best way for Rosneft to supply crude to Essar is via its equity in Venezuela, said Tushar Tarun Bansal, director at Ivy Global Energy, an industry consultant in Singapore. Bringing this crude to India helps Rosneft and Russia the most by securing their equity crude supply and not adversely impacting its own market in Europe.By comparison, Middle East exporters led by Iraq and Saudi Arabia provided more than 65% of Indias overall crude imports during the April-June quarter, according to oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan.Strategic dealsRosneft and Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the state oil company, agreed earlier this year to terms on swapping crude oil and fuels. The Russian oil giant also has interests in five projects in VenezuelaPetromonagas, Petrovictoria, Petromiranda, Boqueron and Petroperijathat contain estimated oil reserves that exceed 20.5 billion tonnes (about 150 billion barrels), the company said in February.India has been deepening its energy ties with Russia, which has also developed nuclear reactors in the South Asian nation and has discussed increasing supplies of natural gas through both LNG and pipelines. Indian state-owned companies have so far spent almost $6 billion for new stakes in Russian oil assets in Siberia.After letting India companies invest in Russian exploration and production projects, India is reciprocating by allowing Russian oil major Rosneft to invest in refining in India, said Bernsteins Beveridge. These agreements are very strategic, aimed at boosting Indias energy security and boosting Russias access to the most important long term growth market. Bloomberg",2016-10-17,oMDuiVNGQqQXrS5QCOYSKM,"With the Essar Oil deal, Rosneft is targeting the Indian market which is forecast to be the worlds fastest-growing oil consuming nation through 2040",both,12:27,Rosnefts Essar Oil deal takes Russias turf war to Middle East backyard
-0.17,"Tata Sons Ltd has removed Cyrus P. Mistry as chairman of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and sought to replace him as a director of the software services provider as the fight between the holding company and its former chairman (and significant shareholder) enters a new phase.
				   
				Tata Sons, which has a 73.26% stake in TCS, nominated Ishaat Hussain, a Tata group veteran, as the interim chairman of the company with immediate effect. Thus, Mistry ceases to be chairman of the TCS board, the company said in a stock exchange statement on Thursday.Separately, Tata Sons has requested a shareholder meeting of Indian Hotels Co. Ltd (IHCL) to pass a resolution for the removal of Mistry as director. On 4 November, IHCLs independent directors unanimously backed Mistrys board position as chairman.This could mark the beginning of a protracted battle,  analysts said.Also read: Did Tata Sons violate insider trading norms?According to the articles of association of TCS, as long as Tata Sons (and associates) holds at least 26% of the firm, the holding company has the right to nominate the chairman of the board of directors.People close to Mistry have questioned TCSs move, saying that Tata Sons has the right to only nominate a candidate.TCS had to then convene a board meeting and table the nomination at the board at a meeting or through a circular resolution. Nothing of this nature was done. In pre-meditated haste, by a letter of the same date, TCS has directly gone on to announce that Mistry stands replaced, one of the people said.A TCS spokesperson said the due process was followed. Under Article 90 of the articles of association of the company, the majority shareholders of Tata Sons are vested with the power to nominate the chairman. Accordingly, it informed all the board directors that Hussain is being nominated as the chairman, the spokesperson said. Sumit Agrawal, partner, Suvan Law Advisors, said that under the Companies Act, where articles of association specifically and categorically provide a right to a major shareholder or group of shareholder to nominate a chairman, exercising that right effectively removes the incumbent with immediate effect till a regular appointment of someone else through a shareholder resolution is made.The concept of shareholders right in the modern corporate world denotes the shareholders supremacy in the governance of the business and the affairs of the corporate sector either directly or through their elected representatives, said Agrawal.These shareholders, he pointed out, have certain statutory rights which nobody can take away, except in accordance with prescribed norms under articles and provisions of the Companies Act.That said, the process followed in TCS to nominate a new chairman neednt necessarily be followed in other group companies. Thats because the method of appointment or removal of chairman is incorporated in the articles of association of a company. In Tata Motors, for instance, the right to appoint the chairman lies with the board and not Tata Sons.Also read: Is trust deficit widening on Tatas narrative on Cyrus Mistry?For removing Mistry as a director, shareholder approval is needed and the request for an extraordinary general meeting in TCS by Tata Sons points to that.Under the provisions of the Companies Act, anyone holding at least 10% of a company can call for a shareholders meeting and propose a special resolution to remove directors before the end of their tenure.Amit Tandon, founder and managing director of Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS), a proxy advisory firm, said that the latest move marks the beginning of Tata Sons moving shareholder resolutions to remove Mistry from the board of operating companies.In the case of TCS, as they have more than 70% stake, they are quite confident of pulling it through, he said.In other Tata group operating companies where Mistry is chairman, Tata Sons (plus other group companies that have cross-holdings) owns a 30-35% stake.In Tata Chemicals, whose board met on Thursday, it has only a 29.98% ownership.To pass a resolution supporting the removal of Mistry as director, the Tatas will need a 51% majority. Thus, the role of institutional shareholders, particularly Life Insurance Corp. of India, becomes important.The state-owned insurer holds around 13% each in Tata Steel Ltd and Tata Power, and 10% in Tata Global Beverages Ltd.The vote of institutional investors will be decisive. Perhaps, this is a reason why Tata Sons has come out with a detailed statement today explaining its need to replace Mr. Mistry and also rejecting claims made by him in his letter to the Board of Tata Sons, said a statement by InGovern Research Services Pvt. Ltd.Hussains nomination comes on the heels of a snub the promoters faced on 4 November when independent directors unanimously backed Mistrys board position at Indian Hotels, which owns the Taj group. On Thursday, the independent directors of Tata Chemicals too backed Mistry.Interestingly, Hussain, who is also on the board of Tata Sons, abstained from voting to remove Mistry as chairman of the holding company in its 24 October board meeting.",2016-11-10,oQZzLk3MfdxNik2CRdYXGM,"Tata Sons, which has a 73.26% in TCS, has nominated Ishaat Hussain, a long-time Tata group veteran, as the interim chairman of TCS with immediate effect",competitor,08:42,"Tata Sons seeks Cyrus Mistrys removal from TCS, IHCL boards"
0.24,"Mumbai: The bitter public feud between the Tata family, which controls Indias most respected conglomerate, and its now ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry has created an unwelcome stir in the tiny Parsi community to which both sides belong.
				   
				There are only about 58,000 Parsis in India, a nation of 1.2 billion people. Yet, the community has included some of Indias biggest business names, its top nuclear scientists, world-class musicians and several senior military officers including the countrys first field-marshal.Parsis are also known for maintaining their privacy.They should have settled this between themselves instead of what has happened so publicly, said a Parsi woman stepping out of the communitys fire temple in downtown Mumbai.Also read: Tata, Cyrus Mistry put PR teams in place, facing a long battle aheadThe row between Ratan Tata, family patriarch of the sprawling $100 billion salt-to-steel Tata Sons empire, and Cyrus Mistry, a scion of the billionaire Shapoorji Pallonji clan, erupted in public last week. Both families are pillars of the Parsi community, comprised of descendants of Persians who first landed in India in the ninth century.Tata Sons announced on 24 October that Mistry had been removed as chairman of the company. Sources close to the company said Mistrys corporate strategy was seen as transgressing the core Parsi value of working for the greater common good.A five-page email response from Mistry to the Tata board was leaked two days later, containing scathing criticism of the companys corporate governance practices and Ratan Tatas role in some of the companys costliest errors. The two sides have traded barbs on a near-daily basis since then.Also read: Tata listed firms reply to NSE clarifying on Cyrus Mistrys emailWhile business spats are not uncommon in Indias financial capital Mumbai, the public allegations of malfeasance and the central role of two billionaire Parsis has not gone down well in the community.I would say Cyrus, walk out with a little dignity and self respect. Dont wash dirty linen in public. Dont make the press your playground. Fight battles inside boardrooms, said Rumi Behram Balsara, a second-generation shareholder in some Tata group companies.Tata ethosFrom shipyards to textiles, Mumbais Parsis have led the citys commercial development from a group of sleepy fishing villages to one of Asias business capitals.Parsi business houses owned by the Tata, Wadia and Godrej families are at the forefront of Indias corporate world. The Tata empire stretches from Jaguar Land Rover to Tetley Tea, while the Wadia family owns textile and food-product businesses. The Godrej Group owns interests in everything from consumer goods to chemicals.Also read: The fig leaf of corporate governanceParsis follow the Zoroastrian faith, an ancient pre-Islamic religion of Iran. Some of the tenets of the faith like charity and doing good to others have long been woven into the Tata heritage and business ethos. Much of the dividend paid out by Tata Sons gets funnelled into charitable trusts involved in philanthropic work.The crux of the Tata world view, said Morgen Witzel, a UK-based author of a book on the Tata company, is shareholder value should not be an end in itself. Companies are not machines for making money. They exist to provide value and service to their communities; profit is a by-product of that process.That view appears to be at the heart of the boardroom dust-up. Mistry was attempting to gradually transform Tata from a sprawling empire of middling businesses into a much more focused profit-driven enterprise, but that involved decisions like axing businesses and jobs, moves that jarred with the Tata ethos, say sources close to the conglomerate.Over time, the Tatas had built up a fantastic reputation. However, the size and resistance to change meant that many of their businesses were not able to keep up with the times, said Ronny Bharda, a Mumbai-based Parsi businessman. Cyrus Mistry brought about a renewed sense of enthusiasm. He had the ability to bring about change.Eventually, what social good can the house of Tatas do, if they do not earn any money?More than businessSome Parsis believe the community should ignore the spat.The Parsi community isnt the custodian of thoughts, words and deeds of every Parsi, said Baghzaad Bhomisha, a Mumbai-born Parsi settled in Australia, adding Parsis had bigger concerns than the egos and worthless legacies of Parsi billionaires.Mistry, an Irish citizen, was the first chairman in the Tata groups 148-year history to not belong to the Tata family. He was named chair of the group in 2011 after a lengthy search for a replacement for Ratan Tata. In an organization populated by veterans, his anointment at the age of 43 was a marked departure for the Tatas.Mistrys family is also prominent and has long had ties with the Tatas. His elder brother Shapoor runs the Shapoorji Pallonji conglomerate, which is focused on construction and real estate. It also owns the largest individual stake in Tata Sons, after the family trusts headed by Ratan Tata.The two families are related by marriageCyrus Mistrys sister is married to Ratan Tatas half-brother Noel.Mistrys ouster shows a person with a keen business sense only wont work. Tata is built on more than just business, said Kaizad Todywalla, a Parsi who owns a coin auction house in Mumbai.I personally believe you need a Tata to make sure that the ethos of the group or the philosophy behind it remains. Reuters",2016-11-01,oRoGbj4ivMXhf5SHo5yaqI,"The public allegations of malfeasance and the central role of two billionaire Parsis , Rata Tat a and Cyrus Mistry has not gone down well in the communit",competitor,12:31,Tata vs Mistry shocks Parsi community

				State-run Indian Oil Corp. wants to buy assets globally to ensure a tenth of its refining capacity is fed by crude that is either from its own oil field or from assets where it has a stake, Chairman B. Ashok said in an interview on Monday. That goal will require the company to boost oil production 10-fold to about 210,000 barrels a day in the next eight years. There is a lot of potential production from our existing blocks, Ashok said in his office in New Delhi, referring to the blocks it holds in Africa, Latin America and the US. We are also looking at economics and seeing where the assets are available.Indian Oil, the nations biggest company by sales, and other state companies are increasing global acquisitions to secure energy supplies and meet demand thats expected to double by 2040. The biggest oil sector downturn in a generation opened a window for the energy hungry Indian companies to snap up assets as oilfield operators looked to sell assets or take partners to share expenses.Diversifying geographiesThis is a good time for Indian companies to buy oil assets overseas, said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at InterfaxEnergys Global Gas Analytics in London. There could be potential interest in the Middle East and Africa, and opportunities in Latin American nations such as Brazil and Mexico as they seek foreign partnerships to boost output.China had similarly stepped up overseas oil and gas investments after the 2008 oil price crash, snapping up assets for $108 billion in the five years to 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Indias oil companies spent almost $6 billion buying stakes in Russian oil fields last year. Indian Oil is diversifying its search to other geographies and is evaluating offers from global oil companies that are looking to sell some of their assets to generate cash, Ashok said. He did not give details.There are lot of opportunities possibly on offer in Africa, Middle-East and South East Asia, he said. We are looking at these and if the prices are right, we will go for it.The companys shares, which have risen 55% in the past year, added 1.2% to Rs346.8 in Mumbai on Tuesday.Refinery expansionApart from oil production, the company also plans to increase refining capacity. It is building one of countrys biggest refinery-cum-petrochemicals complex on the western coast along with two other state-run oil companies. It will own 50% in the proposed project and is keen to bring in a foreign partner, Ashok said.Indian Oil plans to spend about Rs1.8 trillion ($26.2 billion) through 2022 to expand it refining capacity to over 100 million tons and build new pipeline and distribution infrastructure. The company currently processes 80.7 million tons of crude a year from its nine plants and two owned by its unit Chennai Petroleum Corp. Indias oil demand is forecast to reach 10.3 million barrels per day by 2040, according to Paris-based International Energy Agency.The countrys 23 refineries have a total capacity of about 230 million tons a year, while total fuel demand was 196.5 million tons during 2016, according to the oil ministry.

-0.51,"Mumbai: Jan Janshen is managing partner at private equity (PE) fund Advent International Corp., which had $29 billion worth of assets under management by the end of 2015. In March, it completed raising $13 billion for its latest fund. 
				   
				Janshen co-heads Advents European operations and is one of the seniormost partners on the Asia Investment Committee, actively working on India deals. In an interview, he talks about Advents investments in India. Edited excerpts:Advent has been a late entrant in India compared to its global peers. While you did your first investment back in 2007 from your London office, you opened an India office only in 2009.I think our business evolves. We do global private equity and we do Asia out of our big flagship global fund. We are a true partnership; the consensus among the partners to set up an office here was evolving. One can debate if we are too early or late, I dont know.We dont only see deal-making, but we also see most importantly that we invest in international if not global companies. The mandate for the Mumbai office is not only doing deals but also help the global portfolio. India is a very key market which they look for market access or a place to manufacture things, sourcing or from supply side. Some of our portfolio companies have also made add-on acquisitions in India.You have only done four deals in the region while others such as TPG, KKR, Blackstone have raised Asia- or India-dedicated vehicles and have been extremely prolific. One would argue the capital allocation from Advent has been slow in the region and that India is not a key market for you.I would turn it differently. We are a true partnership, consensus model, and we try to take that slowly and do it steadily. Clearly, if you raise dedicated funds for the region, then the local team is under huge pressure from day one to put money at work in that region. Actually, what we have seen in our global fund, pre-crisis, post-crisis, and so on, that these regions and countries and sectors dont go in sync. So if you see, what we call dynamic capital allocation, the various funds and which sectors the money goes in and which countries, that can vary from fund to fund.Our model is that we have our own way to find businesses and build businesses. But then, we are agnostic where they are, which size they are; so thats why we felt the advantage of having a Mumbai office as part of the global fund which gives us the benefits of building sustainable businesses without being under pressures.But your capital allocation pattern suggests its pretty much spread across Europe, America taking chunk (40% each) and remaining, about 20%, coming to Asia?We have 180 investment professionals globally, and we have five chosen sectors that we like globally for investments and all of the colleagues look globally for investments. We have no macro overlay. When our investors ask us the same question, what is your capital allocationEurope, the US, Germany, Asiawe dont have. But then, they ask us you must have sector allocationhealthcare, TMT, industrialswhich also we dont have. We have a different way of doing what an Advent deal is. And when we find these deals, we do them irrespective of where they are.So, there is no portfolio construction where we say X% has to go somewhere. What ends up happening is that somewhere 40 Europe, 40 West and 20 Asia, that more happens, but we are not being prescriptive or aiming for these.Clearly in the healthcare space, we have invested in generics quite a bit. Of course, you have the Mumbai team on board, and if you take the global centre of excellence for generics it is in India.How important is India as a market for you?Clearly, very important because its a very big market and fast growing. It is relevant not only from a domestic perspective but also from an international perspective. When we started setting up a team here, building an office, we took a long term view. Currently, the outlook is great if you see various metrics: the stock markets, M&A volumes, the GDP, the wealth being created and so on.On a relative basis, if you compare developed and developing market, India definitely stands out. Lot of the acronyms that emerged such as BRICS vanished but the shining spot globally is clearly India. There is a lot of progress both on the political side and the value being created in this economy.Does that mean you will enhance your commitment here?We are very committed to the region. We are fundamentally oriented and not financial engineers. We really look for companies which have a strong earnings profile. We invest at a sensible valuation with a sensible governance in place and I wouldnt mind putting a billion at work in India. We have a global $13 billion fund, so there is no reason why we wouldnt put a billion at work in Mumbai. We have a successful great team. Shweta (Shweta Jalan is the India head for Advent) is a global partner in the partnership.I think we have all the right ingredients: so the team wouldnt stop us, the capital wouldnt stop us and like in any market, we need to find the right opportunities.Deal-making has become very competitive, with almost every major global PE firm having an India presence now. What is your uniqueness?We would do investments from 100 million to $1 billion which is a fairly unusual size. Because typically what you do is that you have a PE fund and you divide it by 20 which is the average size of the deal and you add and subtract a little and that range becomes your sweet spot. We are completely different as we dont care whether its $100 million or a billion in equity or which country it is  we are attracted by the opportunity.Also, what you see in a lot of private equity firms is that the dominating factor is the office. Where the company is headquartered, that office works on it. We are different. So, if you have a healthcare deal here, the healthcare team from London and Boston are in here. If you look at the cement deal, then clearly the building materials team is on board.We are thrilled whenever we find an interesting deal and thats what keeps us going. Also, we set up the investment committees closer to the region. Our structure doesnt have a CEO, no CIO. We are a true partnership that works in consensus. We also have investment committees which are close to the region. So, you dont have to go to NY Investment committee where nobody knows the local fundamentals, governance, the rule of law etc.So, would we see Advent doing more deals in India?Of course. If you look at the size of the funds, we have been fortunate and successful that our funds were bigger than the last funds and were heavily oversubscribed. As the funds grow, we all have to invest more. PE on the whole is a growth industry. When I joined Advent 17 years ago, we were investing out of a billion dollar fund or something like that. We are now $30 billion assets under management and we raised our last fund at $13 billion in six months and couldnt even talk to outside investors much because there was so much demand. Because our firm is growing strongly, we need to do more everywhere. The question is not if, but a question is how much more the teams can do.",2016-10-02,owQCaeyt7xj8nRBbYeGGGI,"Jan Janshen, managing partner at Advent International, says the private equity fund looks for companies which have a strong earnings profile",competitor,23:15,Advent wouldnt mind putting $1 billion at work in India: Jan Janshen
0.03,"Mumbai: Kshitij Venture Capital Fund, set up in 2005 with a tenure of seven years, which was extended by two years to June 2014, is still to return money to investors, two people aware of the matter said.
				   
				The fund is run by Kshitij Investment Advisory Co. Ltd, a unit of India-focused private equity firm Everstone Capital Ltd.Everstone inherited the fund from its erstwhile joint venture partner Kishore Biyani in 2009 when the two parted ways. The fund was set up by Biyani to invest in realty projects across India before Everstone co-founder and managing partner Sameer Sain joined the board of Biyanis company.The rupee fund had raised Rs350 crore from 40-50 investors with a minimum contribution of Rs5 crore each.After more than 11 years since the fund was raised, Everstone has been able to return only Rs232 crore to its investors, compared to the Rs350 crore it had raised. So, not only investors havent got any returns, they havent even got their initial money back, said one of the investors who did not want to be identified.The fund is now operating without any valid extension from its investors, the investor added.An email sent to Everstone Capital did not elicit any response.During its tenure, Kshitij Venture Capital had invested in 12 properties in cities such as Ahmedabad, Chennai, Indore, Visakhapatnam, Jaipur, Kochi, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mysore, Thiruvananthapuram and two properties in Vadodara. Of these, it has exited nine and written off one. Two are still to be built, the investor mentioned above said.The properties that are still to be built are in Kochi and Mysuru. The delays have been due to permissions regarding opening of theatres, said a second person familiar with the fund, explaining that the Mysuru property was in partnership with the government and the land had encroachments on it.The fund now plans to write off (the) Mysuru project as well as the permissions have yet not come, said the person.However, the person said the fund will return all the money it has taken from investors in the next six months as it is in the process of finalizing the Kochi property transaction.The Everstone Group was founded by Sain and Atul Kapur in 2006 and has more than $3.3 billion in assets under management.Its roots can be traced to Future Group and its initial businessesasset management and financial serviceswere set up in partnership with Biyani in 2006.The relationship, however, did not last long and the parties decided to part ways after a couple of years. Everstone bought out Future Groups stake in the asset management business and over time sold its stake in listed financial services company Future Capital.Everstone now has four lines of business: private equity, real estate, credit and consumer venture capital and six funds under managementIndivision India Partners ($425 million), Everstone Capital Partners II ($580 million), Everstone Capital Partners III ($730 million), Horizon Realty Fund ($350 million), IndoSpace Logistics Park I ($240 million) and IndoSpace Logistics Park II ($344 million).While Everstone scored some strong exits such as Sula Wines and Global Hospitals in its PE business, realizing more than three times the invested capital, other investments such as engineering, procurement, and construction firm Billimoria & Co. and Future Groups e-commerce venture failed to take off.Several real estate funds of the pre-2008 vintage seem to be confronting problems similar to those of Kshitij Venture Capital, according to industry experts.Post-2008, lot of funds have burnt their fingers. Very few PE funds have generated exponential returns for investors. Several retail investors saw their investments getting eroded in the post-2008 period, said Sambhav Ranka, partner at law firm IC Legal.Real estate funds have struggled to generate strong returns after the 2008 market crash, he said, adding that in the last three to four years, real estate investment has moved from equity to structured debt investments.

0.05,"Nestlé India is making a slow climb back to its position before the Maggi recall episode, but its proving to be an uphill task. The packaged food sectors sales growth is best assessed on a year-on-year basis, as sequential comparison can be affected by seasonality. In Nestlé Indias case, the depletion in Maggis sales calls for an exception.Sequentially, the companys sales rose 12.8% to Rs.1,791 crore although it fell by 24% from a year ago. The decline was less than the 32.1% decline in sales seen in the September quarter. The product was relaunched in the December quarterthe masala variant was first and the chicken flavour was added recently.On a sequential basis, margins have improved, chiefly due to lower raw material costs. Thus, the margin of sales left after deducting material costs has increased by 1.3 percentage points sequentially and by 3 percentage points from a year ago. That benefit carried through to the operating profit margin, which rose by 2.4 percentage points sequentially but declined by 3.3 percentage points sequentially over a year ago.That does seem like a reason to celebrate. However, it is early days yet for Nestlé India and its investors. Sales in the near-to-medium term can be expected to increase, as it refills the market. Investors will want to see if the instant noodle market will bounce back to the pre-crisis levels, in terms of volumes.The Maggi episode did affect other categories and the company has become more aggressive in the market, with price discounts on some categories, to drive sales growth. This may be a function of competition too. But that has not hurt margins, at least on a sequential basis.Two factors are in Nestlé Indias favour. Its products are largely urban-centric, making it less vulnerable to the rural demand slowdown that is playing out. Urban consumption is not healthy either but has been picking up slowly, in recent quarters. The second is commodity costs and food prices remain low broadly. Sugar and palm oil prices have seen some volatility. A low raw material price situation gives the company ample legroom to grow volume sales growth even while sustaining its margins.It may seem like the proverbial fairy tale ending is just a few quarters away for Nestlé India. But investors dont think so. Its share price is down by 23% from mid-October. One major fear is that even if the noodles market recovers, it will be the likes of Patanjali noodles that may reap the benefit. This quarters sales growth was also a bit lower than what some analysts had expected.There is also the matter of the governments pending appeal in the Supreme Court on the Maggi issue. If it goes in the companys favour, and if Nestlé Indias sales growth continues on an upward trajectory at a pace that inspires confidence, then investors may regain interest in its stock.",2016-02-17,pAg3rv8FrfTJHSvaRzCCbK,"Nestlé is making a slow climb back to its position before the Maggi recall episode, but its proving to be an uphill task

0.28,"Oil majors including Statoil, Shell and Chevron are experimenting with various technologies, from drones and drill design to data management, to drive down costs and weather a deep downturn. 
				   
				Crude prices have more than halved since mid-2014, forcing companies to cut billions of dollars in costs. Determined to shield dividends and preserve the infrastructure that will allow them to compete and grow if the market recovers, they are increasingly looking to smarter tech and design to make savings. French oil and gas major Total said it was now using drones to carry out detailed inspections on some of its oil fields following a trial at one of its Elgin/Franklin platforms in the North Sea. Cyberhawk, the drone company that led the trial, said this kind of work was previously carried out by engineers who suspended themselves from ropes at dizzying heights. It said the manned inspection used to take seven separate two-week trips with a 12-man team that had to be flown in and accommodated on site.The drones do the work in two days and at about a tenth of the cost, according to the UK-based firms founder Malcolm Connolly, who said it had also worked with ExxonMobil, Shell, ConocoPhillips and BP. Total declined to comment on how long the manned or drone inspections took, or specify how much money was saved.Statoils giant Johan Sverdrup field, the largest North Sea oil find in three decades, is a leading industry case study for cutting costs in the era of cheap oil.The firm has cut development costs for the first stage of the project by a fifth compared with estimates in early 2015, to 99 billion crowns ($12.2 billion). The savings have largely been made by focusing on the most efficient technology and designs from the beginning, Statoils technology head Margareth Oevrum, told Reuters in an interview. Executives say the growing attention on technologies that have been around for some time shows how wasteful the global industry had been in the years before the downturn.For example, simply finding a more efficient route for the oil pipeline that would carry the crude from the Sverdrup field to the onshore refinery cut 1 billion crowns, Statoil said. It has also developed a drilling template that is acting as a guide for the first eight wells to be drilled at the field. It said it had reduced the overall drilling time by more than 50 days, saving about 150 million crowns per production well.Global upstream oil and gas spending has fallen by more than $300 billion across the industry in 2015-16, according to the International Energy Agency. Around two-thirds comes from cost cuts, it said. Alex Brooks, oil and gas equity analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said tech innovation in the industry was about 100 tiny things, adding: The bottom line is you end up with a much lower cost.Another way firms are looking to cut costs is by using their vast amounts of data to better predict their needs. Since the price slump, firms such as Shell, ExxonMobil and Statoil have started using software to better manage their data to cut wastage in the ordering of construction materials. Gunnar Presthus, Nordic energy lead at consultancy Accenture, who advises oil majors and national oil firms, said the downturn had led to the industry waking up to the potential of the data they store. The oil industry, to some extent, is one of the most digitalized industries, he said. Companies are now able to use this wealth of data to make changes that will save money.",2016-10-17,pK4u37UCcXUpnNABQ8lkvL,"Crude prices have more than halved since mid-2014, forcing oil companies to cut billions of dollars in costs and look at smarter tech and design",competitor,01:50,Oil giants explore new technologies to cut costs

-0.13,"Can an 18-year-old microfinance company outshine the most valued private sector bank of India? 
				   
				This is exactly what the valuations of Bharat Financial Inclusion Ltd (BFIL) seem to suggest.The stock trades at a price-to-book value multiple of 4.1 times its estimated earnings for fiscal year 2017, while HDFC Bank Ltd is trading at a multiple of 3.9.For those who feel this is like comparing apples with oranges, let us look at BFILs peers in the non-banking financial company space. In fact, rising financial conglomerates Bajaj Finance Ltd, mortgage lending behemoth Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC) and Repco Home Finance Ltd are the ones that are getting such high valuations.Still unconvinced with the comparison? BFILs former microfinance peer Equitas Holdings Ltd, which has morphed into a bank, is valued at 2.9 times its FY17 earnings. Another microfinance turned bank Ujjivan Financial Services Ltd is no different. At the surface, BFILs 87% growth in net profit for the September quarter, its over 50% growth in loan disbursals, an asset under management growth rivalling most peers and an envious asset quality support a premium price tag. The microlenders track record post the 2010 Andhra Pradesh debacle has been impressive. Even with scorching growth, there is a semblance of caution at the company. Gross non-performing assets were 0.1% of its loan book in the September quarter.Given that BFIL is the largest and the only listed microfinance lender, it is viewed as the only door for investors to enter into a sunrise sector with promising growth potential. But is it the only entrance? It is but a technicality that separates Equitas and Ujjivan from BFIL as these are morphing into banks. By nature of business, small finance banks can be viewed as microlenders too with an advantage of access to public deposits. Perhaps fatigue has already set in with BFILs stock down 5% to a one-month low now after running-up 50% between April and September. But the jury is still out with some analysts still having a buy rating. Those like Religare Capital Markets  Ltd that have a sell tag, rely on the riskiness of the sector to justify their call.

Given the quickening of the pace, the total loan portfolio grew by 16% to Rs2.75 trillion after adjusting for the sale of loans to HDFC Bank.The mortgage lender was able to keep its asset quality under check as well, with gross bad loan ratio at 0.76%, little changed from the previous quarter.

-0.34,"Mumbai: Dell Technologies chairman and chief executive officer Michael Dell is determined to change the common perception of his companythat its a traditional maker of low-margin products like personal computers, servers and storage systems.
				   
				The view changed little even after Dell said in October 2015 that it will buy EMC Corp. Now that the merger of the two companies is complete, Dells strategy to alter this view is revolving around quickly rolling out new infrastructure products that have been jointly developed by Dell and EMC teams, cross-selling them to clients of both, strengthening existing partnerships with firms like SAP AG, Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp., and forging new ones even with competitors like Amazon Web Services Inc.Dell executives say they are best suited to help clients go digital with the combined entitys broad technology portfolio, which not only comprises computing products but also services and solutions in the areas of hybrid cloud, software-defined data centres and converged- and hyper-converged infrastructure (integration managed by software), platform-as-a-service, data analytics, mobility and cybersecurity.This multipronged strategy was evident when Dell took the stage at the first-ever Dell-EMC World 2016 event in Austin, Texas, on 18 October, and gave an impassioned speech that had all the trappings of a successful road map for next-gen computing.Beginning with a reiteration of the Go Big or Go Home, Baby! slogan delivered at last years Dell event, he peppered this years speech with technology buzzwords like digital, the Internet of things (IoT), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI).Alluding to Dells Digital Transformation Index , Dell underscored the presence of a digital fear among the 4,000 business leaders across 16 countries and 12 industries that were surveyed as part of a recent report. His pitch: This (digital) future is coming very rapidly and the future does not care whether you are ready. But we do... (We are) the trusted provider of essential infrastructure for the next industrial revolution.Dell evidently believes in economies of scale, made evident by his Go Big slogan. The Dell-EMC merger, announced last October, was the largest deal in tech history, topping Avago Technologies Ltds $37 billion purchase of Broadcom Corp.Dell Technologies is now a $74 billion company that comprises a PC business and affiliated businesses including virtualization (the partitioning of a physical server into smaller virtual servers in a bid to reduce costs) company VMware Inc., security firms RSA Security Llc and SecureWorks Inc., software and services (including cloud and Big Data analytics) company Pivotal Software Inc., and cloud management software firm Virtustream Inc. Dells eponymous combined business now comprises two segmentsDell EMC is the sub-brand for the companys enterprise business, including products and solutions, and Dell is the sub-brand for the companys client solutions for consumers, business and institutional customers.Dell plans to go about the task of ramping up business growth also by touting that the combined company stands as a market leader in many of the most important and high-growth areas of the information technology (IT) market, including positions as the Leader in 20 Gartner Magic Quadrants and a portfolio of more than 20,000 patents and applications.Does the pecking order bear out Dells claim?To be sure, the worldwide IT spending figure augurs well for technology companies like Dell Technologies, which figures in the top three in PCs, servers and storage.Overall IT spending is forecast to reach $3.5 trillion in 2017, up 2.9% from estimated spending of $3.4 trillion this year, according to Gartner Inc. According to the research firm, software and IT services segments have been the bright spots. Software spending is projected to grow 6% in 2016 and another 7.2% in 2017 to total $357 billion, while IT services spending is forecast to grow 3.9% in 2016 to $900 billion and 4.8% in 2017 to $943 billion.ALSO READ | Dell Technologiess road map for IndiaThe total worldwide enterprise storage systems factory revenue remained flat year-on-year at $8.8 billion during the second quarter of 2016, according to research firm International Data Corporations (IDCs) Worldwide Quarterly Enterprise Storage Systems Tracker. EMC and HPE (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) accounted for 18.1% and 17.6% of spending, respectively, of the enterprise storage market (IDC declares a statistical tie when there is less than 1% difference in the revenue share of two or more vendors.). Dell held the next position with 11.5% share of revenue during the quarter. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and NetApp Inc. accounted for 6.8% and 6.7% of global spending, respectively.Sales of server-based storage were up 9.8% during the quarter and accounted for almost $2.4 billion in revenue. External storage systems remained the largest market segment, but the $5.7 billion in sales represented flat year-on-year growth. However, according to Liz Conner, research manager of storage systems at IDC, spending on all flash-based storage deployments continues to grow and help drive the market, following the decreasing cost of flash media, deployments and availability of flash-based storage products (a sharp focus area for the combined entity, Dell Technologies).ALSO READ |In firms, PCs and smartphones coexist in a multi-device world: Michael DellIn the same period, worldwide server revenue declined 0.8% year-on-year, while shipments grew 2% from the second quarter of 2015, according to Gartner. Dell moved into the top spot in shipments, while HPE remained the worldwide leader in server revenue.Dell garnered 19.3% of the market and moved into the No. 1 position in worldwide server shipments due primarily to growth resulting from programmes it has in place in the Asia-Pacific region, most notably in China. HPE continued to lead the x86 server (Intel-based server) market in revenue with 26% of the market. IBM secured the third position with 9.1% of the market, but experienced the largest decline among the top five vendors, according to the Gartner report.Contrarian betsNotwithstanding the scepticism over the merger, there is certainly some merit in Dells claim over the economies of scale that this merger can achieve even as there remain formidable challenges that continue to keep some analysts and clients sceptical. The challenges include concerns over the sum paid for the acquisition, integration challenges, some overlap in products and technologies between Dell and EMC, leadership issues in the combined entity, and partnership conflicts since some Dell partners compete with EMC and VMware.Michael has an opportunity to redefine computing if he reinvests on innovation and can pare back the debt, said R Ray Wang, principal analyst, founder and chairman of Silicon Valley-based Constellation Research Inc. He, however, pointed out that customers and partners remain sceptical, wondering if this is an exercise to sell off the parts of the acquisition to pay down debt and save Dell, or a strategic play to own the cloud and the future of the data centre.Shedding the enterprise software assets leads us to believe that this may not be an innovation play yet but a move to sell off assets to save Dell. The experience at HP Enterprise is what customers are scared of. They dont want to see their favourite vendors exit the market where massive investments have been made. The challenge is having two legacy players come together for innovation. The math in the accounting makes it hard to believe what innovations will come about. Dell did attempt to address this road map at Dell World but most of our clients remain sceptical, said Wang.Dell is also a contrarian when it comes to defying certain technology trends. For instance, Dell became a private company on 5 February 2013, in a deal led by Silver Lake that was valued at $24.9 billionthe biggest leveraged buyout since the financial crisiseven as other tech firms seek stock market listings. Second, he believes in mergers and acquisitions even as competing companies like Hewlett Packard have split their businesses. Third, while the world is betting on smartphones, his company no longer makes them.I dont think the world needs another smartphone company, says Dell. A smartphone is just another node, explains Dell, adding that all the information you get on a smartphone comes from a data centre. And what you upload, goes back to the data centre.This, for Dell, is a business opportunity since his company provides servers that are used by data centres.Wang agrees that the smartphone market is a bad one to be in and is not worth it when you dont own the OS (operating system).However, the fact is that even as Dell remains optimistic over the future of the PC (desktops and laptops), worldwide PC shipments totalled 68.9 million units in the third quarter of 2016, a 5.7% decline from the third quarter of 2015, according to the preliminary findings of Gartner. This was the eighth consecutive quarter of decline in PC shipmentsthe longest streak in the history of the PC industry.Lenovo Corp. continued to be the worldwide market leader based on preliminary PC shipments, but HP Inc. is nearly tied for this top spot. Segment-wise, Dell claims his company is No. 1 in PCs in terms of revenue but Dell ranked third in terms of shipments with a share of 13.5% in the third quarter of 2016. (All these rankings could change when final shipment results are published by Gartner.) Dell is insistent that revenue is more important than shipments.Banking on innovationWe have been growing (the PC business) for 15 quarters. We want to be profitable so that we can reinvest in innovation, he says. Part of his companys innovation is around the PC computing system, as Jeff Clarke, vice- chairman of operations and president of client solutions, puts it. There is much innovation in the PC computing system... like the computer becoming personal and new experiences with AR/VR that provide users with new ways to interact, explains Clarke. In a 7 September blog, Clarke also points out that beyond the device, workforce transformation requires a cloud-based infrastructure to support peoples new behaviors, new devices and new expectations, which EMC can provide. He also underscored the importance of Airwatch (now a Dell company) as an EMM (enterprise mobility management) solution for managing phones and tablets.And with cloud client-computing VDI (virtual desktop infrastructure solutions) from VMWare, we are the only true end-to-end VDI provider in the industry, from planning to deployment, data center to the endpoint, on- and off-premise. Bottom line: Combining EMCs cloud capabilities with our award-winning PCs, we have just created a very powerful solution, wrote Clarke.For instance, the Dell-EMC product collaboration has resulted in products like VxRaila hyper-converged infrastructure solution from VMware that includes fifth generation Intel Xeon processors and Dells PowerEdge servers. As opposed to a converged infrastructure model (also known as hardware-defined) where the server, networking and storage can be separated if needed, in a hyper-converged infrastructure (referred to as software-defined) the components are integrated and hence cannot be split.The other part of innovation revolves around Dells belief that IoT is fundamentally changing businesses. Explaining his rationale for why we created Dell Technologies, Dell says the planet is becoming more intelligent and more connected by the minute, and ultimately will become intertwined with a vast Internet of Things, paving the way for our customers to do incredible things.Dell elaborated in his speech that as the cost of making something intelligent approaches zero dollars, intelligence is being embedded into every aspect of our physical world. We have about 8 billion connected devices on the planet, and 15 years from now there will be 200 billion or more, and all these sensors and nodes in those devices will provide access to a host of new digital applications, creating massive new sources of information. Using this information to provide better insights and build a better world may be the biggest opportunity in history, he said.Using the premise that everything improves about 10x every five years, Dell in his speech also envisioned a future with smart cities, driverless cars and nanobots that cure cancer and repair cell damage. He added that overnight shipping will seem like snail mail compared to the instant gratification of drone delivery... AR and VR will redefine work, learning and play... machine learning, deep learning, AI and unsupervised learning to all this data will unleash a torrent of innovation and progress and solve some of the worlds greatest challenges.Towards this end, Dell and EMC have made a cumulative research and development (R&D) investment of $12.7 billion over the past three years and plan to invest $4.5 billion in R&D this year, which is multiple times what the competition is investing, Dell said.Dell, for instance, has invested in six worldwide global command centres where technicians constantly monitor events like flight delays, traffic jams, weather conditions, earthquakes or even unsettling events like riots that might impact the companys ability to handle a support call. The technicians track live tweets, live broadcasts of news and weather, and map the location using geographical information systems and Google Earthall in a single window using a customized interface. India (Bengaluru) does not have a global command centre but has a social media listening command centre.In June, Dells Extreme Scale Infrastructure group unveiled Tritona liquid cooling technology that scores over traditional air-cooled solutions for data centres. It designed this water-based system to cool server chips (developed with Intel Corp.) in eBay.coms data centres.In an 18 October note, Mike Krell, lead IoT analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, agreed that Dell Technologies was uniquely positioned to help customers solve their IoT puzzle. Dell, Krell wrote, combines experience and credibility with specific vertical market enterprises, a curated partner ecosystem with deep vertical knowledge, the industrys broadest offering of IoT-focused infrastructure, and an ability to provide a world-class customer experience to help customers solve specific IoT problemstoday.But will Go Big work for Dell?Dells growth strategy also revolves around acquisitions, which Dell says will continue. Ever since Michael Dell returned to the company as its chief executive in 2007, the company has spent as much as $15 billion on more than 30 acquisitions prior to the $67 billion EMC purchase. These included EqualLogic ($1.4 billion; storage area networks, where EMC dominates), Perot Systems ($3.9 billion; IT services), SecureWorks ($612 million; security services, where EMCs RSA division has a big presence), Force10 ($700 million; data centre Ethernet switches) and Quest Software ($2.4 billion; system management and security software), among others.However, not all of those acquisitions have done well for Dell, including some with a significant presence in the Indian market (security provider SonicWALL, for instance). According to a 20 June report on TechCrunch, while Dell had reportedly paid $3.6 billion for Quest Software and SonicWALL, it was only able to recoup around $2 billion for the duo when it sold them to private equity firm Francisco Partners and hedge fund Elliott Management. Dell also had to sell Perot Systems to Japans NTT Data Corp.  for $3.1 billion in March.Nevertheless, analysts like Ashish Nadkarni, program director for IDCs worldwide infrastructure practice, believe that having a bigger, more full-service portfolio allows the combined company (Dell Technologies) to address a wide range of use cases in a very holistic fashion. In a 16 April note, he pointed out that these solutions could be diverse and even emerging, like IoT and real-time analytics. Dell and EMC can likewise take advantage of synergies when it comes to joint go-to-market efforts around compute, storage, and networking solutions,  wrote Nadkarni.He also believes that since Dell Technologies is a privately-held company, it will be able to offer the flexibility of interesting product road maps and solutions as well as additional purchasing options, like subscription-based offerings, free from the 90-day shot clock pressures typically exerted on public companies.On his part, Dell is clear that his company needs to savour customer relationships. He concludes: There are many customers who do not want to change, and we dont want to change them. There are plenty of opportunities for cross-selling. When we looked at the top 5,000 Dell customers and the top 5,000 EMC customers, we found only 1,000 common ones. So there are enormous opportunities to cross-sell among the portfolio. Customers are excited about that toothey actually like the fact that we are bringing everything together with these engineered and integrated solutions. Thats what we are focused on.",2016-11-15,qV03Hr8aiVWnLwqzhDJqpM,Dell is leveraging its EMC acquisition to offer services and solutions for companies to cope with the fast-transforming digital landscape,both,04:42,Will Dell make it big with EMC?

-0.63,"Wipro Ltd, for now, is lagging behind Infosys Ltd in growth. Still, when it comes to mergers and acquisitions (M&As) and investments in start-ups made by the two rivals over the last two years, Infosys Ltds boss Vishal Sikka may want to look at Wipros playbook, overseen by chief strategy officer Rishad Premji. 
				   
				Rishad Premji is the son of Wipro chairman Azim Premji, and reports to Wipro chief executive officer Abidali Neemuchwala.Over the last year, Infosys, surprisingly, has shied away from buyouts, despite spending $390 million to purchase three firms in the first year of Sikkas tenure (see chart). Infosys is grappling with finding a stable management team to steer its M&A division. In July this year, Sikka asked Deepak Padaki to head the M&A team, just 18 months after Infosys reposed faith in Sikkas former SAP colleague, Ritika Suri, to oversee the M&A division.Finally, the pace of investments in start-ups made by Infosys has slowed; the firm has made only two investments since January. Infosys has spent some $33 million (out of its $500 million fund to invest in start-ups) to buy stakes in eight start-ups and an undisclosed amount in Vertex Ventures, a Palo Alto-based venture capital firm. Seven of these investments were made in 2015.M&A is an important theme for Infosys as the management expects $1.5 billion in new revenue from buyouts as part of Sikkas ambitious target of hitting $20 billion in revenue by March 2021. The three buyouts made by Infosys, for now, are estimated to bring less than $90 million in revenue.Wipros strategy is the most aggressive among home-grown IT firms, and can become a template for both Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys, its bigger rivals, in how to better deploy cash and also invest in areas which can make outsourcing companies future-ready.Wipro, in the last 18 months (since April last year, when Neemuchwala joined the company as chief operating officer), has spent over $1.13 billion in making four buyouts which, in addition to making the firm future-ready, together bring in over $550 million in revenue. TCS boss N. Chandrasekaran has not made a single buyout or an investment in start-ups in the last two years. Wipro has done a better job of M&A than most IT services firms to date, said Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm. They (Wipro) have been more deliberate whereas Accenture has been very aggressive, although the net results are the same. Wipro has got new service mixes and capabilities along with new clients. One aspect is the emphasis of taking company cultural considerations into play.Wang said that it appears that Infosys has slowed down M&As and venture activities. Infosys maintains that it continues to evaluate firms and start-ups and there is no slowdown in decision-making. Im very focused that every business unit should not have more than one acquisition to integrate and digest, Neemuchwala told Mint last week, explaining that M&As will bring in a significant share of revenue in Wipros ambition of becoming a $15 billion firm by 2020.Wipro has spent over $22 million (of a $100 million fund) in picking minority stakes in seven start-ups and a venture fund.Sikkas and Rishad Premjis style of running their M&A and venture arms is also different, as none of Infosyss executives, including Suri (who oversees Infosys Innovation Fund), have any experience in the venture capital space. In contrast, Wipros venture arm is run by Venu Pemmaraju, a former senior investment manager at Intel Capital, and company executive Biplab Adhya, who both report to Rishad Premji.One of the biggest benefits Wipro has accrued from its buyouts is that it has managed to retain the tag of Indias third largest software services firm, leaving HCL Technologies Ltd to be content at the fourth position.Wipro does not spell out the growth brought in from its four buyouts and the organic growth, but a senior executive conceded that the growth in core IT services has considerably slowed down. If Wipro manages to grow at the upper end of its 2% growth forecast in the fourth quarter, it will add $445.3 million in incremental revenue in calendar year 2016. The four buyouts are estimated to have accounted for at least $350 million in new business, translating to about 78% of all new business.HCL Technologies, which reported $6.23 billion in yearly revenue at the end of March 2016, will end with $7.04 billion in revenue at the end of March next year if it manages to grow at the managements at-best 13% annual guidance. Wipro, which does not give annual growth guidance, is expected by analysts to report at-best 5.5% growth, translating to the company recording $7.75 billion in revenue at the end of the current financial year.",2016-10-29,qeaQ9hDqenc00ogIsHBKlM,"Wipros M&A strategy, overseen by Rishad Premji, is the most aggressive among home-grown IT firms, and can become a template for TCS and Sikkas Infosys",both,00:03,Has Wipros Rishad Premji triumphed over Infosyss Vishal Sikka? 
-0.25,"If you are looking to embark on the human resources (HR) analytics journey, look no further than the good old recruitment process.
				   
				Once the process starts, recruiters use the recruitment brief and their judgement to shortlist candidates for interviews. Firms typically have huge amounts of historical data on employees who have performed well and those who have not. This clustering of employees can serve as a benchmark in selecting new ones. Top employees outperform average employees by up to eight times, so historical data has great potential.The interview process has various stages and there are dropouts in every stage. The questions to be asked are: what stage sees the most dropouts and why? Is it due to of low compensation figures, or is the process is taking too long? If low compensation is the reason, what is the delta that will lead to better salary elasticity?Among those that are hired many drop out in the first six months. The questions here are: what made them quit, and how can the firm identify the kind who are likely to leave soon?These questions indicate how data-led approaches can help transform the recruitment process. There are opportunities that lead either to process improvementsthe domain of efficiencyor to better HR decisionsthe domain of effectiveness. An analysis by McKinsey and Co. found recruitment efficiency can be improved up to 80%.Enterprises can tap the mountains of data they capture to foster new ways of decision making. For instance, the increasing availability of employee data in core IT applications is stimulating a fact-based approach to improve HR decisions.While the nature of applications of data varies according to enterprises, HR data is mainly being used to describe the state of HR metrics through simple statistical analysis; to construct statistical and machine learning models that lead to predictions and extract drivers that explain the phenomenon being modelled; and to deploy strategies to gauge the efficacy of the extant HR practice at enterprises.Drivers of HR analyticsBefore getting into the nuts and bolts of HR analytics solutions, we should perhaps acknowledge that data and human behaviour could work at cross purposesjust like oil and water. Besides, motivations that drive behaviour are intangiblethey cant be easily quantified.That said, one can get surprisingly better insights should one have access to longitudinal data. Having longer, time-series data, as it turns out, allows us to have a better stab at the problem. Since the data generation process continues as long as an employee remains in active engagement, access to data per se is not an issue. Moreover, statistical models are adept at identifying changes in employee behaviour over time.While there are certain HR problems that currently do not have a satisfactory solution within the existing management practices, HR departments can address many of the problems with data-led solutions.Profiling and segmentationSegmentation can be performed to isolate groups of employees with similar metrics. Identifying cohorts of similar employees reflects common performance drivers, characteristics and priorities. Each of these clusters can be explored with heat-maps and business metrics to derive the underlying narrative of the corresponding segments. The lessons derived from segmentation can be applied to effectively hire new employees and answer questions as to how long is an employee, on average, likely to stay.Performance predictionPerformance targets, especially for large enterprises and publicly-held companies, are so tightly intertwined with the broader stakeholder expectations that any misalignment or fall-back in performance can have considerable material implication. Prediction of the performance of front-line sales people is necessary for forecasting business throughput. Managers can use predictions in creative ways. For example, if the gap between performance and targets is expected to be large, other instruments such as advertisement and promotion or sales incentives can be introduced.AttritionEmployee churn is a fairly costly proposition for employers. Losing well-performing employees, acclimatised to the cultural moorings of the enterprise, is a concern. Also, higher employee churn invariably leads to escalation in costs in the form of new hiring, raising compensation levels, increased transactions and loss in productivity.Predictive models can assist not only in identifying those who are likely to quit but also when they might. Employees who score high on the performance index and high on churn probabilities are the obvious candidates for attrition intervention programmes. With statistical techniques such as Design of Experiments, the intervention programmes can be optimised to deliver lower employee churn. Offer rejectionGiven that filling a new position or a replacement invariably takes time, coupled with the waiting period between the offer acceptance and joining date, a dropout is bound to cost both time and money. This has a cascading impact especially in delivery-oriented or revenue-generating roles, and offer rejections can at times set back business plans. Predictive solutions can identify specific individual-level likelihood of a dropout, thus allowing the HR team to follow up with suitable actionsresulting in superior conversion rates.As technology and analytics occupy centre stage in business set-ups, firms slow in adopting technology and building analytics capabilities, risk lagging behind in the market place. The best firms see their employees not only as individuals but also as a rich source of collective data that can be used to make better talent decisions.Alok Shende is founder and director of Ascentius Insights.

-0.71,"Infosys Ltds December quarter results were in line with Street expectations, which isnt great news because expectations had been running low. Revenues fell 1.4% sequentially to $2.551 billion, largely due to the ramp-down of a large project with Royal Bank of Scotland Plc. (RBS) subsidiary Williams and Glyn.
				   
				While the trouble with the RBS project was already known, it turns out that revenues from some other large clients also fell meaningfully last quarter. Revenue from the top 10 clients fell as much as 9.1% sequentially. The RBS project is estimated to have accounted for about half of that decline, which means revenue from other large customers fell 4.5% sequentially.The company management played this down, saying this was due to the seasonal weakness that is typical of the December quarter. Customers take furloughs and have a lower number of working days at the end of a calendar year.But the companys guidance for the full year and the March quarter doesnt inspire much confidence either. According to analysts at Emkay Research, the annual guidance suggests revenue growth of 0.3-1.8% in the March quarter in constant currency terms, which is lower than the 1.9% sequential growth reported by the company in the corresponding period a year ago.ALSO READ | Infosys cuts full-year revenue guidance againThe company said certain pockets of headwinds and some client specific changes are responsible for the guidance, even though most of the verticals it operates in look set for a bounce-back.

Its net interest income rose 31% to Rs209 crore, while the non-interest income was up Rs36 crore to Rs64 crore during the quarter. The share of low-cost current and savings account balances increased to 25.85% as on 31 December, from the 21.91% three months ago, on the back of a surge in deposits following the governments demonetisation move. The surge in deposits, coupled with a massive slowdown in advances (which grew only 2% sequentially) led to a drop in the credit-deposit ratio to 77.41% from 83.33% in the year-ago period. The banks net interest margin was down 3.95% as against 3.96% in the year-ago period, primarily due to pressure on yield on advances, managing director and chief executive Murali Natrajan said. He added the bank is confident of sustaining the number but may not bother much if it dips to up to 3.70%.A sale to an Asset Reconstruction Company(ARC) helped improve the gross non-performing assets ratio to 1.55% from the 1.98% in the year-ago period. The banks provisions rose to Rs31 crore from Rs21 crore, but Natrajan said it also includes money set aside for non-payment of advances up to Rs1 crore. The total capital adequacy ratio for the bank stood at 13.33%, including 11.39% in core tier-I.

-0.55,"Kolkata: Unfazed by its earlier failed attempts to expand overseas, state-owned miner Coal India Ltd (CIL) will again scout for reserves of coking coal and high-grade low ash thermal coal in countries such as the US, Colombia, Canada, Australia, Indonesia and South Africa.
				   
				Mozambique, where last year it had to surrender a block taken for exploration because of its unfavourable geology, is not among the target countries this time, according to bid documents released by CIL.The public sector behemoth appears to be a little behind in seizing the opportunity to secure assets when coal prices were low, experts said. But the CIL management is of the view that asset prices may have still not bottomed out.Several coal producers in the US, including Peabody Energy Corp.the worlds largest private sector coal minerwere until recently wallowing in losses and had filed for bankruptcy last year in the wake of falling coal prices.But coal prices have started to firm up again, and many of them might emerge from the crisis within months with the help of fresh bank funding.Inviting bids from investment bankers, CIL said it will not be able to meet the demand for coking coal and high-grade low ash thermal coal from its own mines in India, despite efforts to ramp up production.Reserves of recoverable coking coal, which is used in production of steel, is limited in India, and high-grade low ash thermal coal is almost unavailable in India, CIL said in its bid document.This isnt the first time CIL is scouting for assets abroad.Under the leadership of Partha S. Bhattacharyya, who retired as CIL chairman in February 2011, the company had almost concluded a deal to acquire a 10% stake in Peabody Energy, which would have given it access to a large volume of coking coal mined in Australia at a concessional price. But the deal didnt materialise because there were no clear guidelines on overseas acquisitions, Bhattacharyya had then said.Overseas acquisitions are fraught with risks, and no executive at the state-run enterprise would take responsibility for a failed investment, said a key official at CIL, who didnt wish to be named. It had serious implications, even after retirement.Though the government tried to make things easier by issuing some guidelines towards the end of 2011, CIL started to explore other ways of importing coal such as through long term supply contracts with international producers. This plan, too, didnt materialise.This time, CIL is looking to partner overseas miners to start new mines or take equity interest in operating mines which will give it the right to import a certain share of the outputan arrangement which is known as production sharing or participation interest in mining parlance.Previous attempts to acquire assets abroad failed because asset prices were too high for CILs liking, the spokesperson for the miner said, adding that miners were at that time driving a hard bargain because they had too many suitors.Globally asset prices could soften further, according to this person, and CIL has entered the market at the right time. Theres been a bump in coal prices recently, but this would ease out in 3-4 months, he added.Scouting for coking coal assets abroad makes sense, said an industry expert who didnt want to be named. But it is late in the day to look for thermal coal. In India, demand for thermal coalor the variant used in power generationis not growing at a pace previously anticipated.

-0.02,"San Francisco: Google just debuted a digital assistant, which it hopes to place inside smartphones, watches, cars and every other imaginable internet-connected device. Its already hit a snag.
				   
				The Alphabet Inc. division launched new smartphones last week with the artificially intelligent assistant deeply embedded. It also rolled out a speaker with the feature at its core and announced plans to let other companies tie their apps and services to the assistant.A day later, Samsung Electronics Co., one of the largest manufacturers of smartphones and other consumer devices, said it was acquiring Viv Labs, a startup building its own AI voice-based assistant. At first, the deal looked like a counter-punch to Samsung rival Apple Inc.  Viv is run by the creators of Apples Siri assistant. But buying Viv may be more of a problem for Google, because Samsung is the biggest maker of phones running Googles Android mobile operating system.Google strategy is now centered on the assistant, rather than its search engine, because its a more natural way for people to interact with smartphones and other connected devices. Getting all Android phone makers to put the Google assistant on their devices would get the technology into millions of hands quickly. But Samsungs Viv deal suggests assistants are too important for phone makers to let other companies supply this feature.Last week, Samsung executive Injong Rhee said the company plans to put Vivs technology in its smartphones next year and then embed it into other electronics and home appliances. A Samsung representative and a Google spokeswoman declined to comment.Thats a necessity for Samsung, according to some analysts and industry insiders.As AI is becoming more sophisticated and valuable to the consumer, theres no question it will be important for hardware companies, said Kirt McMaster, executive chairman of Cyanogen Inc., a startup that makes Android software. McMaster, a frequent Google critic, said other Android handset makers will likely follow Samsungs move. If you dont have an AI asset, youre not going to have a brain, he added.Google may already have known that some Android phone makers  known as original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs  were reluctant to embrace its assistant.Other OEMs may want to differentiate Googles Android chief Hiroshi Lockheimer told Bloomberg before it released its own smartphones. They may want to do their own thing  their own assistant, for example.Samsung and Google have sparred in the past over distribution. Google requires Android handset makers to pre-install 11 apps, yet Samsung often puts its own services on its phones. And the South Korean company has released devices that run on its own operating system, called Tizen, not Android.Keeping upViv was frequently on the short-list of startups that could help larger tech companies build assistant technology. Founded four-years ago by Dag Kittlaus, Adam Cheyer and Chris Brigham, the startup was working on voice technology to handle more complex queries than existing offerings. While it drummed up considerable attention and investment, Viv has not yet released its product to the public. And some analysts are skeptical of Samsungs ability to convert the technology into a credible service, given its mixed record with software applications.It will be very hard to compete with Googles strength in data and their AI acquisitions, said Jitendra Waral, senior analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. Samsung would need to prove that its AI solutions are superior to that of Googles. They are handicapped in this race.Samsung is also focused on handling the fallout from its exploding Galaxy Note 7 phones, potentially taking management time away from its Viv integration.But its a race Samsung has to join. In recent years, Samsung acquired mobile-payments and connected-device startups to keep up with Apple, Google and Amazon.com Inc. Digital voice-based assistants may be more important, if they become the main way people interact with devices.Silicon Valley titans are rushing into the space because of this potential. Amazon is trying to sign up developers for its Alexa voice technology. Apple has recently touted more Siri capabilities and opened the technology to other developers. And now Google, considered the leader in artificial intelligence, is making its own push.I dont ever remember a time when every single major consumer tech company  and even enterprise companies  have been singularly focused on an identical strategy, said Tim Tuttle, chief executive officer of MindMeld Inc., a startup working on voice interaction software. Theyre all following the exact same playbook. Bloomberg",2016-10-11,r3BDuvPlvO0Czy3noC8aiK,"Samsungs buying Viv Labs may be more of a problem for Google, because it is the biggest maker of phones running Googles Android operating system",competitor,17:39,Googles plan to spread its AI assistant hits Samsung roadblock
-0.66,"Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltds (RIL) third-quarter report card may not have had the stock market excited, but the energy company expects its gross refining margins (GRMs) to stay in double digits going forward. 
				   
				GRM is what a refiner  earns from turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel. RIL announced its third-quarter results on 16 January. During the quarter, RIL's GRMs stood at $10.8 per barrel, against $10.1  in the second quarter and $11.5  a year ago. Though it reported a $4.1 per barrel premium to Singapore complex margins, it was the lowest in the past three quarters. Singapore GRMs came in at $6.74 per barrel. This is our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit GRMs and double-digit GRMs are good, said Srikanth Venkatachari, Reliances joint chief financial officer, after the companys  earmings conference. Srikanth added that he sees the GRMs sustained at these levels going forward. As a refinery, we are seeing a demand growth for products. The underlying demand trends are good. When you look at the demand for refined products and the supply for the same, clearly, demand outstrips supply. Our own outlook is that we continue to think that the refining environment is in a good spot. (RIL) Management expects GRM to remain strong as net refining capacity addition of 5 million barrels of oil per day (mbpd) over the next five years will lag demand growth of 6 mbpd. In the medium term too, fuel demand growth of 1.3 mbpd in CY2017 shall surpass refining capacity addition, thereby keeping margins firm. Also, strong demand growth from Asia (especially India and China) and refinery closures in Europe will support GRM, said Axis Capital in its research report dated 17 January.Refining and marketing and petrochemicals form over 95% of RILs profit. RIL reported a 3.6% increase in its consolidated net profit at Rs7,506 crore for the three months ended 31 December from Rs7,245 crore a year earlier. Consolidated revenue came in at Rs 84,189 crore against Rs 72,513 crore a year earlier. Goldman Sachs in a report dated 17 January said it expects RILs refining margins to outperform peers. The company refined 17.8 million tonnes of crude oil during the quarter, lower than the 18 million tonnes  a year earlier, following a five-week shutdown at a catalytic cracking unit. The company operates two refineries in Gujarat, with a combined capacity of 1.24 million barrels a day. RILs two refineries in Jamnagar help it process cheaper crude, boosting its refining margins. RIL, which has invested heavily in expansion of its core projects, will see the expansion paying off from FY18. Analysts expect GRMs to be boosted by $0.7-$0.9 per barrel by the commissioning of the expansion of its core projects.  ""RILs grandiose $50 billion capex programme is nearing completion and will effectively double its gross block by FY18 estimated. About 35% of the overall capex was incurred towards core businessesrefining, petrochemicaloff as cracker ($5bn); petcoke gasification ($5bn); and US ethane imports ($1.5bn) are on track for commissioning from January 20117 to end CY17.These should further enhance GRMs and petrochemical margins,"" said Edelweiss Securities Ltd in its report dated 16 January.  Investment in petcoke gasification will help RIL meet its entire fuel requirement at the refineries and eliminate its petcoke production of 6.5 million tonnes a year, generated from two of its cokers. The technology for petcoke gasification will help RIL produce 23 mscmd (million standard cubic metres a day) of syngas and will aid in reducing R-LNG (regasified liquefied natural gas) intake for its refineries.  In the analyst meet, the company highlighted plans to raise the utilization rate for its downstream refining units, which along with term contracts on heavy crude, should help cushion the impact from potential reduction in crude discounts. The company highlighted its flexibility to move product yields by 10-15% which we believe should support GRMs as we see diesel margins outperforming gasoline in 2017,"" said Morgan Stanley in its report dated 17 January.",2017-01-24,rJaSLjQgZUrrwefo1NcxRO,GRM is what a refiner  earns from turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel ,competitor,10:28,RIL hopes its double-digit GRM will continue to hit the sweet spot

				Even starker is the 90% erosion in market cap since the shares hit an all-time high on 14 January 2008, after which the global markets went into a tailspin with the Lehman-crisis.If weak residential property sales and an inventory overload of existing projects is one reason for the loss of investor confidence, the bigger issue is its huge interest burden that erodes profits quarter after quarter.For the March quarter, the firm paid out an interest of Rs.633 crore, as high as 25% of the net sales clocked during the period. Even the 20% year-on-year growth in net sales did not ease the cash flows. Although DLFs sales came in significantly higher than Bloombergs nine-broker consensus estimate, in terms of area, it sold less in the residential segment than it did a year ago.Besides, a report by Elara Capital Pvt. Ltd says that weak market conditions were mirrored in the companys sales in fiscal 2016, with nearly 90% of pre-sales accruing from two projects, while the rest of its projects across the country saw no traction. Obviously, this leads to higher inventory, working capital and project cost overruns. The management, in its analyst conference call, reaffirmed the stress on this account, which is likely to ease only a year hence.The bright spot during the quarter and through fiscal 2016 was a steady improvement in its commercial business segment. Yet this is insufficient to mend the debt problem. As of 31 March, DLFs net consolidated debt is a huge Rs.22,000 crore and high interest outflows continue to take a toll on the companys financials. The March quarters operating profit was about 23% higher than a year ago; but then, with the rising interest burden, net profit at Rs.131 crore was 25% lower and also fell short of what analysts had penciled in.Still, if one wonders why DLFs stock has been steadily moving up, it is because of the managements decision to sell some of its assets and raise funds through real estate investment trusts and sell 40% of its stake in its rental business armDLF Cyber City Development.

Mistry on Monday announced his decision to not contest the forthcoming extraordinary general meetings (EGMs) and instead step down from the board of all the operating companies where he is a director.
ALSO READ | Cyrus Mistry cedes space to take moral high groundIn his first media interaction since the boardroom putsch that forced him to exit, Mistry said he is shifting gears and taking the fight with Tata Sons to a bigger platform, hinting, perhaps, at legal challenges to come. He said Tata Sonss coercive behaviour and uncertainty facing the shareholders had made him decide to quit. Edited excerpts:What prompted this decision to step down?I think the reason for the decision is wedded in the history of the Pallonji family, which has always supported the Tata group. What I have seen in the last eight weeks is a significant coercive behaviour from Tata Sons with employees and other stakeholders,  and as you see in their EGM notice, a threatening attitude, creating a situation of tremendous unease.My belief is that from here, the platform has to change to the legal side to ensure we protect the shareholders. The output is still the samewhat we are ensuring is governance reform and ensuring the ethical values of the founder... I will continue to pursue that very vigorously. What we have seen in the last eight weeks as far as the EGMs are concernedthe process has shown a lack of governance which I have detailed out. It has thrown up many ethical issues that have come to the fore. What we also saw in the last eight weeks is the huge amount of uncertainty, which I wanted to put to bed.What was the trigger for the move to step down?There was no trigger. One has to reflect from time to time. What we have achieved so far, is to initiate a dialogues for change and reform. What one would achieve by going ahead with the EGMs would be more destructive than productive.History shows that we have always looked at the best interest of the group. I believe the best interest of the group will be served by taking this to a new platform.What nextI cant discuss the legal strategy, but you will see it unfold.What would be the status of the EGM (of Indian Hotels) which was to take place tomorrow (Tuesday)?I think the EGM will be cancelled.What other steps will you take to ensure that all these governance reforms are carried out?We have brought the dialogue on the table, both from the point of view of governance and ethics, and I think that is today in peoples minds. I believe you will see shareholders in the near future demanding (better) governance.Have there been any instances that make you feel that some of this has already come to the fore?Yes, I think I will not go into the details of which one, but there have been instances of that.And I think also what is important was to first take me out of the equation because if I am in the equation, it gets clouded. I want to take myself out of the equation to make sure this is not a battle about me; this is effectively a battle for company governance reform. So by doing so, I have taken myself out of the position. I have been consistent if you see on the same thingin my EGM, in my representation.Again, I have reiterated this in my letter to the TCS (Tata Consultancy Services Ltd) shareholders. Many shareholders are ready to abstain to send a message to the company that this is not something that they wanted to do.Would Mr Wadias moves have had an impact?Mr Wadia has taken his own independent decision, and I think Mr Wadia might well continue with his position. His position is different from mine; his position is from an independent directors point of view, and, clearly, the fact that I am not contesting the EGM, strengthens his position because there is no question of him supporting me. I think he has always been for the institution of independent directors and thats the fight that he will continue I am sure.Whats the end game in terms of governance reforms that you want to achieve?I think from my perspective whats important is that the (Tata) Trusts themselves look at an appropriate governance structure, whether thats including succession planning, decision-making, and the interface with Tata Sons.ALSO READ | Tata Sons calls Cyrus Mistry resignation a deliberate strategyTata Sons itself at the board (level) has to reform and understand how it interacts with the Trusts and with the operating companies. And I think thats the part of the reform that needs to happen on the governance side. If you look at it on the ethics side, I think people who have been involved in any unethical actions have to vacate office. I think thats crucially important.Why did it take you so long to raise these issues?If you look at it, all of these issues,  whether they are governance reform and ethics, are exactly what I have been raising in Tata Sons. My role in Tata Sons is actually to raise those issues. My shareholders representation has raised the same issues. I have raised those issues again in the TCS letter, so I have been consistent. You will also see that in my statement and you will see that statement in the video (Editor's note: Mistry released a video on Monday explaining his position)  that effectively these were part of the board agenda the day that I was removed, and most probably a part of the reason I was removed as well.Did you these issues before the 24 October board meeting?The governance issues have been raised for a long time; the debate on performance of governance or structures of governance have been there for more than six months may be close to a year.You said in your letter that Ratan Tata said the reason (for removal) will go down with him to his grave...?I am waiting.

Unrelated as these tasks may appear, Schmidhuber thinks a seemingly random training regimen is key to creating artificial intelligence that can solve any problem.
				   
				Schmidhubers AI theories tend to carry weight. In 1997, he co-authored a seminal paper that laid the groundwork for modern AI systems. It introduced a form of memory modelled after the human brain that helps computers make decisions based on context and prior experiences. The concept underpins most modern AI networks. Today he serves as the head of a Swiss AI institute thats proven to be a fertile breeding ground for many of the worlds top experts. The New York Times recently referred to him as a would-be father of AI.ALSO READ | Charting our artificial intelligence futureIn the last couple years, Schmidhuber has been toiling away in relative obscurity on a small venture called Nnaisense SA. As his ambitions grew, the company, whose name is pronounced nascence, raised its first round of venture capital this month. The funding shows that investors are willing to make a bet on Schmidhuber and his big ideathat just as with a child, the more skills Nnaisenses AI acquires, the easier it is to learn new ones.Schmidhuber, a consummate academic, said he decided to raise money partly to guard against the likes of Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Baidu Inc. The big companies came in and tried to hire my best people away, he said. One of the reasons that I had to become an entrepreneur, as well as an academic, was to try to defend that.Creating an all-purpose AI is a steep challenge for any company, let alone one with 15 employees. Nnaisense may not have the vast reams of search data on which Googles machines learn, but it can more nimbly jump from project to project, exposing its digital mind to many different experiences in the process. We always let it learn something new on top of the previous professions, Schmidhuber said. As you are learning new things, you want to make the task more complex.ALSO READ | Reverse-engineering artificial intelligenceSchmidhuber believes that by contracting out the services of his company to a variety of industries, the skills learned from each job will gradually snowball into a system capable of tackling any challenge it faces. Some within the AI community are skeptical of Schmidhubers bullishness. Companies such as International Business Machines Corp. and German start-up Arago GmbH have worked for years on applying AI to various unrelated projects without achieving consciousness. (But Watson has gotten pretty adept at chess and Jeopardy!)Nnaisenses new financier is Madrids Alma Mundi Ventures. Rajeev Singh-Molares, a partner at the firm, said hes optimistic about the startups chances going up against much larger companies. His firm invested $2 million to $5 million, though he declined to specify the exact sum. The big boys and girls have a lot of data, but they dont have this cross-industry datain insurance, banking, automotive, industrial processes and a couple of others, he said.ALSO READ | Securing a digital futureNnaisense recently worked with Volkswagen AGs Audi luxury auto unit to create a miniaturized car able to park itself. The system used cameras to teach itself how to drive on its own.

0.62,"Mumbai: One of the biggest drivers of Indias superlative macro-economic performance in the recent past has been a relatively under-appreciated element: oil. Since 2014, the dramatic fall in crude oil prices has helped India contain her twin deficits, and tame inflation. But with oil exporting countries planning to curtail oil supply, raising the possibility of a rise in oil prices, the Indian economy might soon have to deal with another pain point besides demonetisation.
				   
				The extent of the gains from lower oil prices since mid-2014 is under-appreciated as the benefits have not been evident in the retail prices of petrol or diesel. However, the government did improve its finances, using the opportunity to increase the amount of taxes collected on petroleum products, as the charts below illustrate.The excise duty collected by the Union government on petrol and diesel has been hiked nine times since November 2014. The Union governments tax collection from petrol and diesel has increased from 0.4% of GDP in 2013-14 to 1.1% in 2015-16, i.e. an increase of 70 basis points (bps) in two years. To put this in perspective, this is more than the 60 bps reduction achieved in gross fiscal deficit (from 4.5% of GDP to 3.9% of GDP) over the same period. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.In other words, the entire reduction in Indias fiscal deficit could be attributed to the increase in Centres tax revenue from petrol and diesel alone. Hence, it is fair to say that falling crude oil prices have driven the improvements in Indias public finances over the past couple of years. Looking at more recent data for the first half of the fiscal year ending March 2017 (April-September 2016), and combining taxes with other oil-linked receipts such as dividends from public sector petroleum companies and states VAT collection on petroleum products, we find that the total receipts of the Centre and state governments from the petroleum sector have risen by about 50 bps since fiscal 2015 to 3.14%.Even the above-mentioned gains from the petroleum sector might be an underestimate because besides the increase in taxes, the Centre also gained from reduced subsidy burden owing to the fall in crude prices. Diesel prices were deregulated in 2014 and the diesel subsidy was eliminated in the last fiscal year (2015-16) itself. Previously, subsidy on diesel would cost 0.6% of GDP (FY14), jointly borne by the government and the public sector petroleum companies. Besides, subsidies on PDS kerosene and LPG have also reduced; however these reductions could also be attributed to government initiative to reform rather than a fall in petroleum prices per se. The upcoming Union Budget 2017 is likely to assume an average crude oil price of $55-$60 per barrel, as reported by the Hindustan Times. However, there remain risks that oil prices, which are already near $55 per barrel, could shoot up if the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and other oil exporters make good on their pledge to cut global oil supply by around 1.8%. Such a scenario, according to the International Energy Agency, would move the global oil market into deficit in the first half of 2017, i.e. demand would outstrip supply, after more than two years of comfortable surplus.In such a scenario, if oil rises above the governments comfort zone to say around $70 per barrel, then the government could lose tax revenues equivalent to about 0.4% of GDP which would jeopardize the governments plan to cut the fiscal deficit to 3% of GDP next year.To illustrate, in a hypothetical scenario where the global crude oil price is $70 per barrel in the coming fiscal year (2017-18) and the USD/INR exchange rate remains stable at 68, the government could either allow the petrol price (Delhi) to rise by another Rs10 to over Rs80 per litre, or reduce its excise tax duty from currently Rs21.48 per litre to Rs11.48 (if it wishes to keep prices same). If the government decides to reduce excise duties on petrol and diesel in similar fashion, then the Centres revenue from petrol and diesel could shrink to 0.7% of GDP in fiscal year 2018 compared to 1.1% in fiscal year 2016, back-of-the-envelope calculations show (assuming annual growth of 11.4% and 4.1% in demand for petrol and diesel respectively, as has been observed in the year so far). Thus, a spike in oil price to around $70 per barrel is enough to strain our public finances and add 0.4% to the Centres fiscal deficit. This would be over and above the increasing expenditure obligations on interest, salaries and pensions, compounded by Seventh Pay Commission recommendations and OROP. Read more If the government wishes to keep petrol and diesel prices unchanged, without sacrificing its tax revenues, then it would have to resort to subsidies (or under-recoveries) as used to be the case in yesteryears. Thus, no matter the recourse adopted, government finances will most likely be hit severely if oil prices rise, unless the government allows the prices of petroleum products to rise. Besides posing risks for the governments finances and stoking the fires of inflation, a rise in oil prices would also worsen the current account deficit. Assuming crude oil prices at $70/barrel and pencilling a constant pace of rise in volumes in oil imports and exports, as seen in the current fiscal year so far, and keeping all other things constant, Indias current account deficit could widen to 1.7% of GDP in fiscal 2018 compared to 1.1% of GDP in fiscal 2016.Indias net oil and gas import bill, i.e. adjusting for exports of petroleum products, amounts to around 2.5% of GDP, higher than Indias overall current account deficit and hence plays a big role in determining the dynamics related to the balance of payments. Thus, if there is one commodity to watch out for in 2017, it is likely to be oil.",2017-01-18,ro8NqXjBC4gk1i2OAQdGYN,The entire reduction in Indias fiscal deficit over the past few years can be attributed to the fall in crude oil prices,both,08:51,Why oil can spoil Indias budget math

				Our armys valour is being discussed across the country these days. We used to hear earlier that Israel has done this. The nation has seen that Indian army is no less than anybody, he said. Israel is known for its targeted military strikes against enemy countries and militant outfits. Modi was speaking at a rally in Himachal Pradesh where he inaugurated three hydro-power projects. The issue of surgical strikes has snowballed into a political row with the opposition accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its government of milking it for political benefits. The charge has been rejected by BJP which has insisted that it is taking the issue to the masses to boost the armys morale and highlight the strong political will of the Prime Minister. Underscoring his commitment to the welfare of armed forces, Modi on Tuesday said his government had fulfilled its promise of One-Rank, One-Pension for ex-servicemen, an issue which he said had been hanging fire for over 40 years. Previous governments, he said, duped the people by making tall claims and some of them even allocated Rs.200 crore-500 crore in this regard but never did an analysis of cost burden and how it could be executed. I did it and was puzzled to find that the economic burden kept rising. It worked to be more than Rs.10,000 crore, he said, adding that it was difficult for any government to make such a big allocation in one go.

				After releasing a new version of its bestselling device in September, Apple likely sold 45 million units of all types of iPhones in the most-recent fiscal quarter ending 24 September, according to Wall Street estimates. Revenue probably slipped for a third straight quarter, by 9%, though thats smaller than the 15% decline in the preceding period, forecasts indicate.Unlike previous smartphone rollouts, Apple didnt publish first-weekend sales data after the iPhone 7s 16 September release. That means the companys fiscal fourth-quarter results, due after the market closes on Tuesday, will give the first major clues on how consumers responded to the new device.Apple benefited from an earlier product launch this time, giving the company a week longer than usual to market the device. Even so, Apples growth is being held back by rising competition from lower priced alternatives, especially in China, and smartphone saturation in many parts of the world. Shortfalls in components are also putting a lid on iPhone supply, analysts said.Apple will likely guide that iPhone 7 is off to a good start, but supply remains constrained, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster wrote in a note to investors on Sunday. He rates Apple shares overweight, or buy.For other analysts, the iPhone 7 is a stopgap ahead of a more significant upgrade in 2017 to coincide with the 10-year anniversary of the first iPhone.IPhone 7 is proving an effective bridge to the iPhone 10 super-cycle in 2017, where a powder keg of a dramatically aging installed base lurks just under the surface, Cowen & Co. analyst Tim Arcuri said in a note to clients last week.Chief executive officer Tim Cook may be relieved to see the back of the 2016 fiscal year. The company likely endured its first annual revenue decline in 15 years as global smartphone demand ebbed. Share buybacks and a beefed-up dividend helped limit the repercussions for Apple shares, which declined slightly over the course of the year. The S&P 500 climbed 12% in the same period.Investors will be particularly focused on China, where Apples sales decline has been more pronounced. Competition has increased in Asias largest economy from local rivals offering cheaper phones with similar specifications. There were 32% fewer iPhones activated in China in Apples fiscal fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, according to an estimate from research firm JL Warren Capital LLC.The iPhone 7 was released a week earlier than prior models, which is likely to boost fourth-quarter sales, according to Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski. Apple has struggled to meet demand for the device, which has been boosted by the problems endured by competitor Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., she said. That could help Apples sales in the crucial holiday quarter.The South Korean company recently ended production of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 handset after some devices caught fire. When Apple reports results on Tuesday, it will also provide a sales forecast for the final months of 2016. Analysts currently anticipate sales of $75.3 billion for that period, in line with its revenue a year earlier.With the smartphone market slowing, Apple has placed greater emphasis on its services business, which includes iTunes, iCloud and the App Store. The division has become Apples fastest growing and in the latest quarter it likely benefited from the popularity of Pokemon Go, according to Piper Jaffrays Munster.

-0.11,"Finally, in the last quarter (March) of fiscal year 2016, things did get better for Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T), after three quarters of titanic struggle. But even as it posted a stellar operating performance that beat forecasts on revenue, profit and operating margin, order inflows remained elusive.
				   
				If order inflows are an indication of the times to come, then the 9% year-on-year drop in fresh orders during the quarter is not good news. For the 12-month period ended March 2016, the 12% dip in orders inflows fell short of even the management guidance of flat growth. Not to forget that the management had watered down its estimate from 15% at the beginning of the year. Perhaps the loss of orders in the power segment and the pathetic state of the heavy engineering, metals, and electrical and automation segments explains this drop.However, set this factor aside, and L&Ts March quarter leaves nothing for investors to crib about. Consolidated net revenue jumped by 18.3% from a year back as the companys core business segmentinfrastructureclocked 20% revenue growth. Information technology and financial services too contributed sufficiently to revenue growth.Even better was the beat on operating margin. At 14.7%, it topped the 14-broker Bloomberg consensus by 220 basis points as it raced ahead of the year-ago number by 190 basis points. A basis point is 0.01%. Again, margin outperformance came from the infrastructure segment, which more than compensated for the deplorable performance of the heavy engineering and hydrocarbons divisions. Fortunately, these comprise a small portion of the overall business of the juggernaut.Operating performance trickled down and L&T saw a 19% jump in consolidated net profit, way beyond what the Street expected.This is not all. The management, in its media address, appeared optimistic of an economic recovery both on the domestic turf and in overseas markets like West Asia, other regions of Asia and Africa. And it is still sitting on a massive order book of Rs.2.49 trillion, assuring decent revenue growth over the next three years. Some analysts say that with a sizeable chunk of international orders, the company may not be able to sustain the March quarters operating margin in the near term. Interest costs during the quarter rose from a year back, underlining the pressure on working capital.The moot question is: will the stock continue to inch up as it has done in the last three months, after a spark in the March quarter results? Sure, the stock is among the best plays on the economy and has more often than not outperformed benchmark indices.Or, will a drop in order inflows dampen investor sentiment? Yes, the management has guided for a 10-15% growth in order inflows for fiscal year 2017. What must not be ignored, however, is that fiscal year 2016 too started on a similar note but then estimates were trimmed thereafter.

A changing global regulatory environment and newer analytics products seem to be boosting this segments growth for Crisil, which started life as a credit rater.
				   
				Ebit (earnings before interest and taxes) growth for the research segment was 49.6% from a year ago, helped by expanding margins. Ebit margin grew nearly 6.6 percentage points from a year ago to 35.1% in the March quarter. One part of this rise in Ebit and margins in research could be explained by the depreciation in the rupee. Crisil registered a forex gain of Rs.3.3 crore in January-March compared with a loss of Rs.2.67 crore in the year-ago period.The rating business didnt do that well in comparison. Segment revenues increased by 5.2% and Ebit by 10.9%. While margins improved when compared from a year ago to 33.5%, they were still lower than the December quarter numbers. The ratings business has been lagging behind the research unit for quite some time now, simply because of the economic slowdown. Lower credit growth seems to have led to lower growth in bank loan ratings. Add to this factors such as a decline in government subsidy for small and medium enterprise ratings and rising competition in this space, and there is increased pressure on the rating business.Despite that, the research segment has boosted consolidated profit growth to 40%, the best in eight quarters. While an improving economy and increasing deals will benefit this business, there is some hope for the rating segment too. Declining interest rates could very well lead to an increase in short- to medium-term debt issuance and debt refinancing. That optimistic prognosis doesnt mean that investors would necessarily make a beeline for the stock. Crisil shares currently trade at 37.73 times their expected earnings for 2016.

-0.73,"Just when you think Bharti Airtel Ltd already has all the mobile spectrum it needs, the company goes ahead and buys some more. Last Friday, it announced it will pay Rs.3,500 crore to buy spectrum in the 2300MHz band from Aircel Ltd in eight telecom circles. This is less than a month after it agreed to pay Videocon Telecommunications Ltd Rs.4,430 crore for spectrum in the 1800MHz band in six circles. The spectrum in both these bands is suited for fourth-generation (4G) telecom services.
				   
				Growth for telecom companies is already being driven largely by the data segment; in Bhartis case, voice revenue has declined on a year-on-year basis in the past three quarters. In this backdrop, it makes sense to have adequate spectrum to support efficient data services.Analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd point out in a note to clients, With this deal, Bharti will have 490MHz of broadband (3G+4G) spectrum on aggregate basis across the 22 circles, versus 486MHz of all 4G spectrum owned by Jio. Bharti now has 4G-spectrum (i.e. 1800MHz or 2300MHz) in all 22 circles, and both 1800/2300 frequencies in 13 circles.Besides the wide coverage, spectrum trading has opened a new avenue for purchasing the hitherto scarce asset. In spectrum auctions, the only avenue available earlier, companies often ended up bidding up prices to extremely high levels. After adjusting Aircels spectrum valuation for its remaining validity of roughly 14.5 years, Bharti Airtel has ended up paying around 10% higher than the reserve price set by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.If Bharti had let the opportunity pass and waited for the auctions, it may have had to shell out a substantially higher amount. JM Financials analysts say, We now expect Bharti to focus primarily on filling up its 2100 (3G) and 1800 (4G) gaps in the next auction; reduced competition for 2300 augurs well for other 4G-contenders like Idea/Vodafone. Of course, the deal is a win-win for Aircel as well; this helps it reduce its debt by about one-fifth, according to news reports.While the deal augurs well for Bharti in the long run, investors must note that the benefits may not be visible anytime soon. As it is, the pace of data subscriber additions has slowed, calling to question the large investments on this segment. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds launch later this year could put a spoke in the wheel as well.Even so, these are early days of consolidation and, eventually, subscribers may veer towards telecom operators who provide the best service. If Bharti is able to put all of its spectrum to good use and provide quality voice and data connectivity, its investments can result in substantial returns.",2016-04-11,tLnDGcKIgpJu98oSreWSxL,"If Bharti Airtel had let the opportunity pass and waited for the auctions, it may have had to shell out a substantially higher amount

				VMware will deliver, sell and support a product that lets customers use their existing VMware software with access to Amazons cloud-based storage, database and analytic software, the companies said Thursday in a statement. Hybrid solutions allow customers to run applications on their own servers and through various remote cloud-based applications simultaneously.Called VMware Cloud on AWS, the product will be available in mid-2017. Pricing will be disclosed closer to the release, the companies said. It will appeal to companies that want the flexibility and capacity of managing data via the cloud.Amazon is trying to maintain its lead in the cloud-computing market over rivals Microsoft, Alphabet Inc.s Google and IBM as more companies transition from using their servers to renting computing power and data space hosted remotely, which they access via the Internet. Movie-service Netflix Inc. is a prominent example of a web company powered by Amazon Web Services.VMware is shifting its cloud strategy to focus on selling products that work with existing leaders, rather than trying to establish itself as an alternative to the Amazons of the world. As more companies run applications on rented servers over the Internet, providing services that link the different technologies customers use is a growing opportunity for VMware.Powerful partnershipThe alliance is a very powerful collaboration that gives companies flexibility in deciding whether to transition their data to the public cloud while maintaining investments theyve made in on-premise data centers, said Tim Feeney, an analyst at Morningstar Inc.Essentially, the process of managing the hybrid cloud environment is significantly less of a hassle now, Feeney said. This is a very powerful move for VMware because IT managers are more likely to retain VMwares services for longer.VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger said he sees hybrid solutions providing business opportunities for decades into the future while the on-premise data business slows.The Amazon partnership could be a blow to International Business Machines Corp., which has its own deal with VMware. IBM, however, said in a statement that 1,000 clients are already using the IBM cloud with software from VMware and the partnership has created significant momentum.Microsoft, responding to the Amazon-VMware agreement, said AWS is behind in offering hybrid cloud solutions.Microsoft Azure has always been hybrid by design, based on our decades of enterprise experience, the company said in the statement. True hybrid cloud isnt just connectivity, its consistencyacross development, management, and security.Global public cloud spending is expected to hit $204 billion this year, up 16.5% from a year ago, according to researcher Gartner Inc.

0.69,"The March 2016 quarter will go down as one of the worst in the history of Indian banks as losses piled up and bad loans tumbled out of their cupboards. The five key takeaways are:
				   
				1) The central bank-instituted asset quality reviews full blast was spread over the second half of the year. Indian lenders added Rs.1.4 trillion in bad loans over the course of January to March. This comes on the back of Rs.97,404 crore bad loans addition in the December quarter. All said, gross bad loans for listed banks stood at Rs.5.8 trillion at the end of March, or about 8% of non-food credit. For state-owned banks, this ratio hovers close to 10%. This doesnt include restructured assets, which in many cases, would add half as much more to their stressed loans portfolio.2) The surge in bad loans was not restricted to public sector banks. Even big private lenders such as Axis Bank Ltd and ICICI Bank Ltd saw a sharp rise in bad loans, indicating that the rot runs deep. Whats more, the clean-up is not complete. Many banks have declared watch lists of assetsa good percentage of which they expect to go bad this year. For Axis, this was around Rs.22,000 crore and ICICI Rs.52,000 crore. Among state-run lenders, State Bank of India has declared Rs.31,000 crore worth of loans sensitive and Bank of Baroda about 27,000 crore.3) This big pile-up of bad loans necessitated higher provisions. Over the course of the year, banks had to set aside some Rs.1.75 trillion towards bad loans. Thus, the listed universe of banks in India ended up with losses of Rs.14,685 crore in the March quarter. This number is boosted by private bank profits. The combined losses of state-owned banks were higher at Rs.23,493 crore after a Rs.10,793 crore loss in October-December.4) These losses meant net worth got hit. For 25 state-run banks for whom data was available, net worth fell by Rs.65,350 crore, or 11.5%, in the six months to March. While the central bank had relaxed some provisions for recognizing capital, this kind of continued losses will start affecting their prudential ratios. For about one in three banks, stressed assets (net bad loans plus one-third of restructured loans) are higher than their net worth.5) With a precarious capital position, banks will find it difficult to expand lending. The current recapitalization plan of the governmentabout Rs.25,000 crore in a yearis not enough. Of course, there is a chance that many of these bad loans will be upgraded once the economy recovers and borrower firms generate cash. The wait for an economic recovery continues.",2016-06-10,tzzcv1ZhwJ0vmTqKfcci5K,"March 2016 quarter will go down as one of the worst in the history of Indian banks as losses piled up and bad loans tumbled out of their cupboards

-0.88,"Bengaluru: Wipro chief executive officer Abidali Neemuchwala, who is based out of Dallas, US, could not fly down to Bengaluru when the company declared its second- quarter earnings last week because of a prior engagement. 
				   
				However, in a telephone interview with Mint, Neemuchwala said that Wipro is well-positioned and on its way to make itself a future-ready firm. The former Tata Consultancy Services Ltd veteran, who joined the company in April 2015 as the chief operating officer and took over as the CEO in February this year, has taken steps to improve Wipros delivery and sales capabilities. Edited excerpts: Due to slow growth and declining profitability, and the way technology is changing, many commentators and analysts have questioned the Indian IT outsourcing industry and are pronouncing the death of Indian IT. What are your thoughts? I would not agree with the death of Indian IT. Indian IT has always had the resilience or ability to transform itself. It has the flexibility, the nimble-footedness. One of our industrys core competencies has been our ability to train a large number of people. Now is the market changing? The answer is definitely yes. So what has made us successful in the pastis that going to make us successful in the future? The answer is certainly no. Will change be required? The answer is yes. Will Wipro be able to undergo that change? Absolutely yes. I am absolutely confident. Are we well-positioned as a company? The answer is yes. This is because I have always believed Wipro as a company is entrepreneurial. We are also very technology-centric. We have made investments in digital technologies, like Internet of Things and cloud. We are making the organisation simple and nimble-footed. We are democratising the operating structure where every single unit can run with that. We started hyper automation and now we are ahead of our plan. So going forward times for Wipro will be better than in the past and I wouldnt call it a doomsday scenario.Its now been over eight months and two full quarters with you as CEO. What has been, say, two heartening features for you as the boss and issues which have disappointed you, which you believe could have made your company do better?Two most heartening things which I have seen in the eight months are that our strategy and ambition resonates and percolates to employees and customers. This is very important for any CEO. Simply, because no single CEO can do magic in a company unless the CEO has the power of the organisation. And at the same time making employees believe that their future is tied to the future of the company. I am very glad that we have been able to do this and that is a very heartening thing for me. We had a very stable CEO transition (on 1 February Neemuchwala was appointed as CEO and his predecessor T.K. Kurien was appointed executive vice-chairman). We have a very stable top management team. The kind of changes we wanted to do at the top, we have been able to do without losing the senior leadership talent pool. The second thing is that as we started articulating our strategy, our customers are lapping up to this strategy. The newly-acquired and newly-built capabilities like Wipro Digital or Wipro Consulting or our hyper automation journey combined with Wipro Holmes, or our investments through Wipro ventures... we are able to take these capabilities to each one of our customers. On the other hand, the speed of change which is required and the speed of change a knowledge-based organisation can undergo is something which I would be happier if we could do it faster. Yes, we are an over 170,000-people-strong company. But the pace of change, the training, the way we are changing our processes, all of it I wish I could get done faster. Its not to say Im dissatisfied with the pace but it would be heartening if we could bring this change faster than what we are doing.Two-full quarters as CEO, and you have embarked on a journey by articulating six broad themes. Given these measures you have started, the management has said in the past that a complete turnaround will take time. Will it be fair to ask if the company can come back or say end March 2018 with industry-matching growth or Nasscom-projected growth numbers?Im always careful of putting a timeline and so I believe it is not unreasonable to expect this (by coming to industry-matching growth number by March 2018). I feel very confident and I see green shoots coming in a more sustainable manner. Im very hopeful that four-five quarters is a good time for a very visible outcome or metric for an industry-leading growth or margin.One of the things which is of concern now for many is that despite making three buyouts, with a combined revenue of $340 million, in the last financial year, and this fourth buyout of Appirio, Wipro is not able to record impressive growth. So on the merger and acquisition (M&A) front, how are you going to make sure Wipro is able to integrate buyouts well and scale up business?I think there are two parts. First is having a bold and risk taking ability to buy. And second is staying the course and making these acquisitions successful. We have shown that we certainly have the former. Now, its time to focus on the latter. So take for example, our acquisition of DesignIt (Wipro Ltd acquired Denmark-based DesignIt for $95 million in July last year). When we acquired it, we had 300 designers. Now we have 450 designers. That company on its own has never seen that kind of explosive growth. I feel very confident that we have the right balance where we dont give our buyouts such a tight embrace that we squeeze the company. We keep these buyouts in our shadow but not alone. I believe we have learnt from our past mistakes. Now HealthPlan Services (Wipro spent $460 million to buy HealthPlan Services in February this year) is a recent buyout but I do see very early synergy wins there. Although right now because of US elections and some issues in the Healthcare Payer market, there is a level of uncertainty. Cellent (Wipro paid $78 million in December last year to buy German firm Cellent) is taking a bit longer than the other two but that is because of cultural issues. Also, Im very focused that every business unit should not have more than one acquisition to integrate and digest. So Cellent is under manufacturing and Continental Europe. Appirio will sit with business applications. DesignIt sits with digital.These four buyouts bring over $550 million in revenue. So clearly M&A is going to play a big part of your ambitious target of becoming a $20 billion firm by 2020. What percentage of revenue do you expect to generate from M&A?We dont break out organic or inorganic revenue growth because it can be a bit misleading. But directionally, I can tell you that M&A will not be insignificant. It will be substantial and not small. The ticket size you are seeing is already bold from the Indian IT perspective. But we will not acquire to buy revenue or scale.",2016-10-24,u0swvRQUwz7X2V8n7hWWYN,"Indias IT sector has always had the resilience or ability to transform itself, says Abidali Neemuchwala ",competitor,10:45,IT sector not looking at doomsday scenario: Wipro CEO Abidali Neemuchwala  
-0.33,"Investors have driven up the stocks of the listed associates of State Bank of India (SBI) by as much as 63% in the past month, ever since their merger with the parent was announced. Not surprisingly, these banks trade at significant discounts to SBI.
				   
				SBI shares, themselves, have gained by one-fifth in this period. This is despite a section of the market thinking that the merger will be a distraction for the management, which is struggling to clean up the balance sheet and resolve the bad loans problem. Note also that current chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharyas term is set to end in a couple of months.On the face of it, a merger with the associates shouldnt add to SBIs bad loans problem. The consolidation, if anything, will improve the situation marginally as the increase in bad loans will be slower than advances. The provision coverage ratio will also remain close to 60%.The SBI management has stated that there are three sources of benefit from the merger. The consolidated bank is expected to manage costs betterthe cost-to-income ratio could reduce by as much as 100 basis points (bps). One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Second, a combined treasury could perform better and, third, the lower cost of deposits will boost margins. According to Ambit Capital Ltd, the management pegs total savings at Rs.3,500 crore, which is a quarter of the last three years average combined annual profits of the parent and associate banks.On the flipside, SBI will have to bear one-time pension liability cost as its employees are covered by both pension and provident fund; however, not all employees of these associate banks are eligible for pension. The banks management had forecast this amount to be close to Rs.3,000 crore when announcing March-quarter results on 27 May.The immediate negative impact will be from pension liability provisions due to different employee-benefit structures and a harmonization of accounting policies for NPA recognition, said Alpesh Mehta from Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.The books of the associates have not been subjected to the same scrutiny as SBIs and analysts are worried that they may throw up some skeletons. SBI, itself, has declared a bad loan watch list of Rs.31,000 crore.Higher restructured assets of associate banks cloud the future outlook since there is not much visibility and clarity. One has not heard from their respective managements about how their books have been so far, cautions IIFL analyst Rajiv Mehta.Even if we build in the (SBI) managements expected synergies in our estimates, the impacts on the combined entitys RoA (12 bps) and RoE (194 bps) do not appear significant at this stage, wrote Ambit analysts in a 16 June note.

-0.23,"Mumbai: Even as the crisis at Tata group deepens the role and responsibility of independent directors (IDs) have come to the forefront as they take varied stance in different operating companies, dividing the board and adding to the drama facing the $103 billion group.
				   
				In a note released on Monday, titled Tata-Mistry: Shareholders vs board, battle for supremacy, proxy advisory firm Stakeholders Empowerment Services (SES) prods the independent directors to explain to the stakeholders their divergent views to remove all doubts about the subsequent events that have unfolded since the boardroom coup on 24 October.It also questions the manner in which Mistry was removed from his position as a chairman from the TCS board. In a notification to the exchanges, on 10 November, TCS informed the decision to appoint Ishat Hussain as chairman on the Board of TCS in place of Mistry. SES does not agree that powers of Board or decisions of Board can be changed by shareholders in this manner.Among other things, the report highlights the conflicting stand of some of the independent directors. For instance, Keki Dadiseth, an independent director at Indian Hotels Co. Ltd (IHCL) who applauded the performance of Mistry, is also a trustee of Sir Ratan Tata Trust (SRTT). SRTT is one of the two principal Tata Trusts which control two thirds in Tata Sons, it is also a shareholder in IHCL. It seems like (Mr). Keki Dadiseth has taken two different stands, one where he supports (Mr) Mistry, other where he was also involved in decision making process for replacing (Mr) Mistry as a Trustee of SRTT. Same is true for Narsee Munjee.said the report. SES said unless they come out and state the reason for their diverse views, doubts would remain.On the issue of removal of Nusli Wadia, SES pointed out that while legally Tata Sons has every right to seek removal of any director on board, be it independent director, executive director or otherwise, the issue is whether such an act is ethically right and would pass the benchmark of good governance.SES said it believed the independent directors and all other directors on the board should be driven by interest of the shareholders. Directors (including IDs) do not have the mandate or right to adjudicate and pronounce right or wrong, it said. A divided board, said SES, is not in the interest of the stakeholders and the foundation of collective responsibility cannot survive in a divided board. A divided board is like a vehicle with driver at both ends, each trying to move in his own direction. Division at board level unlike dissent, which reflects a healthy board, is counterproductive and destroys shareholder value.It is in real sense a testing time for them, said the report, alluding to independent directors. It questions the basis on which the independent directors of Indian Hotels and Tata Chemicals Ltd decided to back Mistry. Do they know the truth? If yes, please tell the same to all investors? If not, can they adjudicate based on letters of two sides and decide? Does their job involve adjudication? Are they competent for adjudication? questioned the report. In one way, according to SES, they are guilty of the same hurried decision, which Mistry is complaining of. Adjudication is a process and one cannot decide without serious application of mind taking into account all factors. Have IDs done that? the report asked further.SES, the report pointed out, has been of the view that the action of removing Mistry on an immediate basis was disproportionate to the cause attributed for the decision. Assuming it was based on non-performance, it is difficult to believe that non-performance could be an overnight development which assumed such an enormity that immediate action was required, it said.Indian corporates materially differ from the rest of the developed countries, especially those in the US and the UK, in their ownership structure. In India, almost all companies have a dominant shareholder called promoter. In the US and the UK, holding/ownership is generally dispersed and no one is a promoter, pointed out SES. By equating dominant shareholders at par with minority shareholders, the law has created mismatch of risks and rights.

-0.76,"For a week in May, some of Instagrams designers, engineers and product managers met not at the companys Menlo Park, California, headquarters but at a rented house, stocked with grocery store snacks. 
				   
				There, away from computers and armed with pencil and paper, they explored a question important for the photo-sharing apps future: how do we get our users to shop? In particular, they wanted to figure out how to introduce shopping tools without making them so obvious that they would transform the app into a splashy catalog. Together they came up with 150 ideas. After an extensive process of elimination, the team settled on the design being unveiled this week: letting brands tag products in their photos, the way users tag their friends. Tap on the tagging descriptions to get more information, tap again to buy on the retailers site. Its the first test from Facebook Inc.s Instagram to kick off a broader strategy for helping people pick out and buy things, according to James Quarles, Instagrams vice-president of monetization. The team will gather data from users behaviour to figure out what to do next. Maybe theyll add a way to comparison shop, a way to search for products elsewhere on the app or even a Pinterest-like feature to save posts that inspire, he said. We are so well-positioned in this space, Quarles said. Instagram is super visual, we have a well-defined graph of your interests based on what youre following, and the serendipity of discovery happens every day through the ad products and who you follow.People have long been shopping on Instagram without a formal way to buy things. A crop of influencers on the photo app push fashions into popularity. Company researchers have noticed that users take screenshots of products they love, or direct-message them to themselves. But, like the design teams caution suggests, making shopping an actual app feature is a risky proposition.The main problem: shopping hasnt worked well in social media. Facebooks history is peppered with discontinued e-commerce products, like birthday gifts for friends and Facebook credits, which was a virtual currency for social games. The company recently introduced a Marketplace product that allows people to buy and sell to each other, but its launch was quickly marred when users started posting ads for drugs, sex and exotic animals. Twitter tested a buy button for more than a year, but the project faded and the head of e-commerce departed. Pinterest made a bigger investment in shopping, allowing direct buying on its site from thousands of retailers, but its still unclear how popular the tool is with consumers. Quarles said Instagram aims to learn from all these experiencesespecially from its parent company, Facebook, which has shared its notes. Instagram already lets retailers promote products in ads, but the shopping update would apply to regular posts, making it a more natural experience a more natural experience for users. The apps e-commerce ambitions are largeincluding international expansion and a video version of the productbut theyre starting small. Its testing its new feature with just 20 brands, including Kate Spade and Warby Parker, and not taking any cut of the proceeds.For J. Crew, which is one of the test brands, Instagrams product fills a gap in mobile shopping. For one, its image-based, which makes it much more amenable to inspiring people to buy products than Facebook, according to Jenna Lyons, J. Crews president and creative director. It has the opportunity to take a customer from the point theyre interested in a product to actually making a purchase. Its happening in the real world already, she said.Its been a little frustrating to us in the past to not be able to have people purchase on Instagram, Lyons said. Not only has it become a place for people to get influenced by their friends, but theyre walking into our stores with their phones and saying, do you have this?She is hoping the test will show that Instagrams method is subtle enough to not turn people away, but powerful enough to drive people to J. Crews site. I really hope it works, Lyons said.

				Until about 2010, 70% of our revenue globally was from ERP. At the end of 2015, only about 30% of our revenue was from ERP and 70% was non-ERP, Deb Deep Sengupta, president and managing director, India subcontinent region, SAP, said in an interview.Sengupta acknowledged that while the benefits of ERP became visible in large enterprises, there was this perception that for a smaller company, SAPs technology is very hard to adopt and very expensive too. To address the issue, SAP India introduced many best practices from the implementations it had done in countries such as Brazil and Latin America. We created some packages for micro-verticals (small, specialized industry segments) and created an ecosystem of implementation partners that did not exist earlier, Sengupta said.SAP India also started working with agencies that do nation-building such as the railways, utility companies, ports and airports. We also worked a lot with the defence and home ministries, Sengupta added.In 2010, SAP launched its High-performance Analytic Appliance (HANA) software platform, which enables data processing in real or near-real time for quick business insights and improved decision-making. HANA can be deployed on premise or on the cloud, a model whereby firms do not spend upfront on licensing and equipment but pay on a per-use basis.SAP has also spent billions of dollars on acquiring firms whose solutions are cloud-centric. Some examples include Hybris, SuccessFactors, Ariba, Concur and Fieldglass. These, Sengupta said, have helped SAP rise to the world No. 2 spot in terms of revenue from cloud computing applications in 2015. Globally, we now have over 200 million users on the cloud.Even the core ERP, now christened S/4HANA has been completely re-tooled. In less than a year since its launch in 2015, we have deployed this solution in more than 2,700 companies. It is available on the cloud and on-premise. You can also deploy it in a hybrid model, Sengupta said.The 20.8-billion company, which has about 8,000 employees in India, does not give a break-up of its India revenue, but Dataquesta Cyber Media (India) Ltd publicationpegged the companys India revenue at Rs10,705 crore in fiscal 2015-16.SAP dominates the ERP software market in India; Dataquest reporting its market share at about 47%. Its product portfolio includes analytics, customer relationship management (CRM), expense management, human capital management and business-to-business commerce.The key verticals for SAP in India, according to Sengupta, are manufacturing, consumer goods, professional services and public services. Banking, financial services and insurance is another rapidly-growing vertical for the company, even though competitor Oracle Corp. leads in this space.For Sengupta, digital is not just about the front end; its an integrated thing. Its about the experience, which well provide. He observed that while digital firms are building an offline presence, physical ones are going digital too, known as the phygital trend. Sengupta cited the examples of US sportswear brand Under Armour and the multi-brand digital marketplace of the Tata group in India, Tata CLiQ, as examples of companies going phygital. To cater to this need, SAP announced the launch of the SAP Digital Boardroom in October 2015. According to Sengupta, the boardroom is a digital approach that aims to contextualize and simplify performance reporting across all areas of business in real time. Built on the SAP Cloud for Analytics Solution, the SAP Digital Boardroom incorporates fully automated business intelligence capabilities that aim to dramatically improve the quality and speed of reporting as well as collaboration in real time.SAP is also providing cutting-edge technology solutions to its clients. For instance, it has around 100 engineers working on machine learning, and that team is constantly expanding, said a 1 December 2016 report by research firm Market Realist. SAP is hoping to leverage machine learning to strengthen its cloud-based human resources suite SuccessFactors. Besides machine learning, SAP has also stepped up its investments to drive blockchain innovation. Blockchain is the technology that underlies cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Zcash.If SAP succeeds in its machine learning efforts, it could reduce competition for its products and pave the way for more revenue, the Market Realist report said. But it also cautioned that SAPs aggressive push into machine learning would put the firm on a collision course with Alphabet Inc. (parent of Google Inc.), which is also heavily into artificial intelligence research.The Internet of Things (IoT) is another area of focus for SAP; it announced an investment of 2 billion over five years in the IoT segment. As part of this plan, SAP acquired Plat.Onean IoT services providerlast September.To be sure, SAP will have its fair share of challenges in the coming years, especially in cloud computing, said analysts. For one, SAP does not have its own data centre in India yet. Sengupta pointed out that SAP is tying up with local partners for cloud services in India, but analysts remained sceptical.The growth has been easy for SAP in India when it came to the top 100 enterprises and then another 300-odd large companies, but the joy ride ends now, said Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst and CEO of Greyhound Research. He pointed out that Indian firms are wary about data residing in a foreign country. Gogia added that SAP has not found many takers for its expensive HANA. Though some enterprises have technically bought HANA licences, there are only a few of implementations in the country, as not all ERP modules are ready yet on HANA. Another reason for the lukewarm response to HANA is the lack of skill sets on HANA in India, Gogia noted.The upcoming goods and services tax (GST) regime, which would need ERP to be modified or upgraded for compliance, could also pose a challenge for SAP, Gogia said. While SAP is mandating its clients to buy S/4HANA licences if they want to migrate their existing SAP solution to a GST-compatible version, other vendors are offering to supply the GST patch for free, Gogia noted, warning that firms may shift their custom to other vendors as they embrace GST.The competition is undoubtedly stiff with the likes of Amazon Web Services (AWS), CenturyLink, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and Salesforce offering public cloud platforms. AWS and Microsoft lead the pack among global public cloud platform providers for enterprise developers. IBM and Google offer competitive options. Oracle, Salesforce, CenturyLink and SAP lag behind, according to a 29 August 2106 report by Forrester analysts Dave Bartoletti and John R. Rymer.Among the megacloud providers, SAP is a challenger, the report said. The analysts pointed out that while the HANA cloud platforms greatest strength is in shielding developers from all infrastructure configuration tasks when working with SAP business suites, companies must determine whether the platform is a good choice to also build and deploy applications that are independent of SAPs business suites since the HANA cloud platform offers only a limited set of application development and delivery functions. SAP, according to analysts, is yet to step up to the full range of language run times, databases, and analytics services of the leaders, although SAP recently released an IoT service to all customers. As a new entrant in the market, SAPs partner roster for HANA cloud platform is small, as is adoption of its platform, the report concluded.",2017-01-16,uLYxZE6K7ZZ85besrpDTIK,"SAP, the German ERP software company, has successfully made inroads into cloud computing and digital solutions",both,00:42,SAP: The road beyond ERP

				The dent in demand growth in the worlds third-largest oil consumer is expected to be temporary, though, with India still taking up the third-biggest portionbehind China and United Statesof 2017s rise in fuel use on a barrel-per-day basis, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Indias fuel demand in 2016 grew at its fastest in at least 16 years as low oil prices boosted demand for gasoline and aviation fuels, but analysts say the nations currency troubles will put the brakes on this year. Indias oil product demand growth in 2017 is expected to drop to 160,000 barrels per day (bpd), from 270,000 bpd in 2016, according to Woodmac. We see Indian demand growth slowing ... due to the recent currency demonetisation drive by the Indian government, said Suresh Sivanandam, the consultancys Singapore-based senior manager of Asia Pacific refining research. Prime Minister Narendra Modis currency crackdown has led to a cash crunch that has severely hurt Indias overall output and consumer demand, with December factory activity contracting in its biggest monthly decline in eight years and last months car sales dropping the most in 16 years. Indias growth in both diesel consumptionused mainly for heavy industrial vehiclesand gasoline burned to power cars, is expected to slow, especially in the first quarter, traders and analysts told Reuters. And while this will dent refining margins for diesel, it is not expected to be enough to undercut a strong 2017 profit outlook for the fuel across Asia this year. The cash crunch ... is dampening growth in agricultural and other small-to-medium scale sectors, which are heavily cash-reliant, said Sri Paravaikkarasu, head of East of Suez Oil at energy consultants FGE. It will easily take three to six months for the dust to settle, she said, although long-term prospects remain strong, with spending on infrastructure projects and a resumption in economic growth and freight shipments supporting diesel. Diesel demand is expected to grow only 2% in the first quarter of 2017 compared with a year ago, less than half of the 5% growth rate seen in the first 10 months of 2016, said Tushar Tarun Bansal, director of Singapore-based consultancy Ivy Global. Actual oil demand growth may be lower than projected, though, cautioned an Indian refiner source, as consumers have been stocking fuel to take advantage of an exception given to old Rs500 and Rs1,000 for purchases of diesel and gasoline at retail pumps.

				Experts say this may potentially bring down wind energy tariffs which currently ranges from Rs3.9 per unit to Rs5.9 per unit.The industry is eagerly awaiting the outcome, said a wind energy developer participating in the auction process, requesting anonymity.Another clean energy developer who also requested anonymity said, There is a possibility that the tariffs may fall as low as sub Rs4 per unit.Bids totaling 2,600 MW have been received from 13 companies including Adani Power, Hero Future Energies Pvt. Ltd, Renew Power and Inox Wind for the two-stage processtechnical and financial. Those qualifying the technical bid stage will be eligible for the financial bid stage. Once, the financial bids are opened, a reverse bid auction process will be run to select the developers. The last date for the bid submission was 9 January.2,600 MW is the maximum bids received. The final award can be less than that. Financial bids are yet to be opened, said Ashvini Kumar, managing director, SECI, declining to identify the companies who have taken part in the bidding process. In India, which is the biggest greenhouse gas emitter after the US and China, renewable energy currently accounts for 15%, or 45,917 MW, of the total installed capacity of 3,10,005 MW. Of this wind energy projects alone account for 28,083 MW, placing it at fourth position after China, the US and Germany. In the long run, the price difference between wind and solar will go. Now whether that happens in this tender or the next one (remains to be seen); they (wind and solar) will be competitive, Kumar said while adding that the final tender will be awarded within the next two to three weeks.Spokespersons for Inox Power and Hero Future Energies confirmed their participation in the tender.Queries emailed to spokespersons for Adani Power and  Renew Power remained unanswered at press time. India plans to achieve 175GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022 as part of its climate commitments; wherein it has promised to achieve 40% of its electricity generation capacity from non-fossil fuel based energy resources by 2030. This includes 60 GW from wind power, 100 GW from solar power, 10 GW from biomass and 5 GW from small hydro projects.While remaining hopeful, experts sounded caution on the 1000 MW wind energy project tender.Just as the solar tariffs have benefited from lower panel prices, wind tariffs will also optimise as the auction will create pricing pressure on WTG (wind turbine generator) suppliers. However, given that 70% of the bids are from Tamil Nadu, a high wind regime, the tariffs from this process should not be considered as a benchmark by lower wind regime states going forward. Overall, this is a good initiative and the sector will benefit from this auction, said Srishti Ahuja, director, at consulting firm EY.This comes at a time when the wind energy sector is grappling with issues such as squatters on good wind potential sites, inordinate delays in signing of power purchase agreements and untimely payments, and distribution firms shying away from procuring electricity generated from wind energy projects. The other pertinent issues are: proper scheduling and forecasting of wind energy, availability of transmission facilities and rationalisation of transmission tariffs for wind energy projects.The union government has called a national review meet of states and the nodal agencies for ironing out issues plaguing the green energy sector as reported by Mint on Friday(bit.ly/2iquTy0)India has a wind power potential of around 302 GW at 100 meter hub-height.",2017-01-16,uNn22FVohHnlCNsOtJz4EO,"The development may potentially bring down wind energy tariffs, which currently range from Rs3.9 per unit to Rs5.9 per unit, say experts",both,00:19,SECIs 1GW wind power tender sees high interest

				Given the ambiguity around demonetization, this beat has come as a surprise since the Street was working with a lower number. A Bloomberg poll of 18 analysts had estimated a net profit of Rs3,770.8 crore. Shares of the private sector lender gained nearly 2% after earnings were announced on Tuesday. HDFC Banks loan growth was up 13.45% year-on-year in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 (Q3FY17), but lower than the 18.1% growth reported in Q2FY17. Loan growth in the quarter gone by was anticipated to take a hit due to outflows on account of FCNR (foreign currency non-repatriable) deposits redemption and SME (small and medium enterprises) repayments. Also, low-cost deposits were expected to be strong due to the demonetization exercise. The banks total deposits grew 21.1% year-on-year to Rs6.35 trillion in the quarter gone by.Net interest margin (NIM), which has been hovering in the 4.2-4.4% range for the past many quarters, moderated to 4.1% in Q3FY17. The mismatch in loan growth and deposit growth could be one of the factors that may have impacted NIM. In Q2FY17, NIM was at 4.2% and 4.4% in Q1FY17.Meanwhile, the banks asset quality remained stable. Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) moved up marginally to 1.05% and net NPAs rose 0.32% on a sequential basis. Net interest income rose 17.55% from a year earlier to Rs8,309.09 crore.

				Most premium office buildings in Mumbai, Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), and Bengaluru are fully leased out, while a few of them have vacancies of 2-5%.In Mumbais financial hub of Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), prime office buildings such as One BKC, The Capital, Trade Centre and Platina are 90-100% leased out, company executives and property advisors said. Cybercity and Two Horizon Center, DLFs office space buildings in Gurgaon are 95% occupied, an executive at the developer said, asking not to be identified.Bengaluru-based commercial real estate firm RMZ Corp., which owns around 15 million sq. ft of office space across six properties in the city, said it has about 2% vacant space. RMZs office buildings in Delhi and Mumbai are fully leased out.As per global property adviser JLLs estimates, overall supply of office space in India is pegged at 40 million sq. ft in the next one year. Of this, about 70% or less than 30 million sq. ft is in grade A office buildings. But the forecast for office absorption stands at around 33-34 million sq. ft over the next one year. Last year, net absorption across seven cities was 36.5 million sq. ft.In Bengaluru, where office absorption was the highest in the country at 10.8 million sq. ft last year, rental values of prime commercial properties have shot up by as much as 20% in the last one year. Rentals are moving up because there is dearth of supply and also because of improving qualities. Amenities are getting better. Inflation has also moved up. So overall costs, including construction and land are also rising, said Thirumal Govindraj, managing director (management), RMZ Corp., adding that rentals will move up further over the next one or two years.He said at the companys under-construction Ecoworld office building in Bengaluru, deals are being closed at a monthly rental of Rs80 per sq. ft, against Rs60-65 last year. At its Infinity building on Old Madras Road, rentals are about Rs90 per sq. ft now, from Rs76-77 last year.Monthly rentals in Mumbai have risen by around 3-8% in the last one year, according to JLL estimates. But in a few prime buildings at BKC, rents have remained unchanged, for instance in Wadhwa Groups Trade Centre and The Capital, which are 100% leased out. At present, rents at most commercial buildings in the area hover between Rs230 and Rs320 per sq. ftamong the highest in Mumbai.Growth in rental values in a few good assets in Mumbai has exceeded 10%such growth was last seen five years ago, said Ashutosh Limaye, head (research), at JLL India. While it (rents) has grown over the last few years, the margin of growth has been smaller by around 2-3%. However, rentals in a few select properties have appreciated by around 5-10%, he said.Commercial real estate rentals are likely to rise further in the next one year with no significant fresh supply expected over the next two years, while demand, particularly from the information technology and pharmaceutical sectors, is continuing to grow, said developers and real estate advisors. Most of the new commercial projects in Lower Parel, Wadala and the western suburb region in Mumbai are still on the drawing board.

				Take, for instance, NIIT Technologies Ltd. In the June quarter, the firm reported a 47.5% fall in net profit due to a provision of Rs36 crore for dues it was yet to receive on a government contract, which been put on hold. The companys India business declined 7.2% sequentially in the quarter to September because it earned lower revenue from the government. India now accounts for just 7% of its total revenue.It (India business) impacts cash flow because it is very difficult to collect money from the Indian government... by defocusing on Indian government, we have been able to dramatically reduce the outstandings that we have to the cash flow, said Arvind Thakur, chief executive officer of NIIT Technologies.Both the central and state governments have stepped up spending on IT and e-governance projects. Rigidities built into requests for proposals (RFPs), which dont take into account the complexities involved in project execution, and delays in clearing invoices have offset the attractiveness of contracts.Payment terms and conditions tend to be skewed towards the end of the contract period. The problem worsens in case the project has a significant hardware component that has to be delivered and installed early on in the project life cycle, according to lobby National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom).Delayed payments create serious cash flow challenges for industry, especially smaller and medium IT vendors, and can make projects financially unviable.Day sales outstanding last year was typically between 85-90 days because of all the money stuck in domestic government projects. This quarter, it is 73 days because we reduced dependence on government. So, the entire cash position has changed dramatically, Thakur said.

(ESIC), a government entity, due to non-payment of dues. The company entered into a seven-year contract in 2009 with ESIC as a system integrator to set up a health administration programme for Rs1,200 crore. Wipro has completed its obligations under the contract.

				The impetus behind Toyotas plan for a new car is Indias Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) norms, that seek to ensure that the mileage of cars on Indian roads improves by 10% between 2017 and 2021 and 30% from 2022 while carbon dioxide emissions comes down to 108 grams per litre starting 2022. The mileage improvement will be decided on the basis of litres of fuel consumed by a vehicle to run 100km. The move is targeted at  reducing the carbon footprint of the automobile industry. It is the first time  such norms have been introduced in India.ALSO READ | Global carmakers line up hybrid cars for India, but price still a hurdleToyota, which has a diesel-heavy portfolio of big vehicles, may find it difficult to meet CAFE II norms, effective from 2021, without  hybrid technology, admitted N.

Hybrids offer better fuel economy and lower running costs.Toyota has been a pioneer in hybrid technology since 1997, especially with several  generations of the Prius. Today, Toyotas range of six hybrid cars encompass small hybrids , family-sized cars like the Toyota Prius, even station wagons.ALSO READ | Mercedes-Benz to bring hybrid, electric cars to India in 2018The carmaker seems to have launched from the failure of some its smaller cars in India.  One thing is clear that after Etios and Liva, the platforms need to be global to get economies of scale.

It has set about doing this in a complicated way. While the purpose will be achieved, the restructuring creates a resulting diagnostics business with a rather bloated equity base. One concern could be that private equity (PE) investors in the diagnostics business may decide to exit via this route.
				   
				The diagnostics demerger has been in the news for some months. The twist in the tale is Fortis Malar Hospitals Ltd becoming the vehicle for it; its a 62.4% listed subsidiary of Fortis Healthcare and runs a large hospital in Chennai with an associated diagnostics business.Fortis Malar will first sell its hospital business to Fortis Healthcare for Rs.43 crore. With a market cap of Rs.103 crore, a day before the merger was announced, that appears to undervalue the hospitals business. In FY16, its revenue rose by 14.7% to Rs.129.6 crore but its net profit declined by 18.8%. That may explain what appears to be a low valuation. Shareholders may still question it.The diagnostics business of Fortis Healthcare consists of two partsrunning its own centres as well as the 56.4% stake it owns in SRL Ltd, which runs testing centres across the country.The revenue attributable to this block of assets is Rs.555 crore. This business will be demerged to Fortis Malar, in return for which shareholders of Fortis Healthcare will get 98 shares for every 100 shares held. Using Fortis Malars market price, that translates to a value of Rs.2,519 crore (based on undiluted equity shareholding) and values it at a revenue/price ratio of five times.If we use fully diluted shareholding, assuming full vesting and exercise of employee share options and conversion of foreign currency convertible bonds, then it will result in a higher value of Rs.2,858 crore.Its still not over. Fortis Malar is now left with a residual diagnostics business, a 56.4% stake in SRL and all of Fortis Healthcare Ltds diagnostics business. Next, it will merge SRL with itself and issue shares to SRLs shareholders5.6% is held by Fortis Healthcare promoters and 38.3% owned mainly by PE investors (does not total to 100 due to rounding errors). They will get 10.8 shares for every share in SRL. Thats an additional 378 million shares issued by Fortis Malar, valued at Rs.2,098 crore at the same price.This translates to a combined valuation of Rs.4,676 crore for Fortis Malar (to be renamed SRL), based on this demerger transaction. Its equity capital will range between Rs.86 crore and could increase to Rs.91 crore on a fully diluted basis. That is much higher than the current equity capital of Fortis Healthcare of Rs.52.3 crore. The per share valuations work out to Rs.54 (undiluted) and Rs.51 (diluted).Now, Fortis Healthcare shareholders will own shares in a hospitals business and in Fortis Malar. The demerger could see their valuation decline based on the residual business. In FY16, the diagnostics business contributed to 18% of consolidated revenue but had an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) margin of 24.1% versus the hospital businesss 14.7% margin. Diagnostics contributed to 17% of Ebitda. But Fortis Healthcare shareholders also own shares in the diagnostics business. They will hope this trades at much higher valuations once set free. Two recently-listed diagnostics companies are trading at valuations of 10 and 13 times FY16 revenue, although that seems rich. By that metric, Fortis Malar could trade at valuations of Rs.7,640 crore, based on its FY16 revenue and a price/revenue of 10 times.How these two shares trade post-demerger will determine how much Fortis Healthcare shareholders benefit. Fortis Malar shareholders will benefit if market valuations mirror that of other diagnostic companies.The structuring of the deal could have been less complex and a lower equity bloat would have helped. For instance, it could have merged Fortis Malar into itself, and then demerged the entire diagnostics business in one shot. More clarity on the financials of the new diagnostics entity will help in determining valuations. The merger documents do not give the post-demerger financials of the two surviving entities. An important question remains: will the PE investors in SRL use this opportunity to exit? Recent IPOs have seen PE investors exit. If SRLs investors want to cash out, that may hang heavy over the stock, depending on how they go about it.",2016-08-21,vRp2xduEZP06sdxxiiTghM,The structuring of the deal could have been less complex and a lower equity bloat would have helped,competitor,20:30,Fortis: a knotty demerger
-0.11,"Bata India Ltd is finding it tough to sell shoes. Retail companies in general are facing tepid consumer sentiment. Competition from the online marketers is also making life difficult. Against that backdrop, the shoe maker managed a modest 5% year-on-year revenue growth for the September quarter to Rs.575 crore, well below expectations.
				   
				Gross margins declined 115 basis points to 53%. To liquidate inventory and increase footfalls/conversion which had declined because of SAP implementation/e-commerce impact, Bata India ran various promotional schemes and increased price discounts which impacted gross margin, said Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities in a report on 5 November. Hundred basis points is one percentage point.Operating performance was weak with operating profit margin narrowing about three percentage points to 8.5%, the lowest in the past 10 quarters at least and way below expectations. Nomura Research was expecting an operating margin of 11%. Nearly all cost components, raw material costs, rent and other expenses as a percentage of revenue, increased. As a result, after accounting for higher depreciation and lower other income, earnings before tax and one-time items declined a bit more than a third to Rs.38 crore.What next? The company has said it will be expanding its product offering and strengthening its e-commerce business to reach out to a larger consumer base. As Nirmal Bang points out, it plans to introduce 100 footwear designs exclusively for e-commerce business, which is expected to contribute 70-80% to e-commerce revenue. The remaining e-commerce revenue is likely to be from designs which are common in online channels. However, the brokerage is not satisfied with this performance, saying that Bata India plans to garner revenue of Rs.100 crore from e-commerce business in four years, a mere 3.5% of sales compared to less than 1% of sales currently.Unsurprisingly, analysts have lowered their earnings estimates after the September quarter results. The Bata India stock has declined 1.6% since numbers were announced and trades at 24 times next fiscal years estimated earnings. Of course, if those valuations are to sustain, revenue growth and margins have to recover. Unfortunately, from a near-term perspective, the outlook on both measures is subdued. For one, revival in consumer sentiment may be slower than expected. Secondly, weak revenue growth and higher costs could mean pressure on margins will continue for some more time.",2015-11-12,vWe3NqrzaSM3LaTjuUTFsI,"Bata India managed a modest 5% year-on-year revenue growth for the September quarter to Rs575 crore, well below expectations

-1.0,"State-run refining and marketing companies (OMCs)Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL)have all delivered strong June quarter results. 
				   
				A key reason why these companies were able to perform better is the fact that they reported a better gross refining margin (GRM).For the quarter, the measure for IOC, HPCL and BPCL stood at $9.98 a barrel, $6.83 a barrel and $6.09 a barrel, respectively.GRM is a measure of profitability for refining companies. In general, GRMs of refining companies were expected to get a boost from inventory gains, thanks to the rising oil price trend over the quarter. That has panned out. Spark Capital Advisors (India) Pvt. Ltd says, adjusted for refining inventory gains, the GRMs for these companies were in the range of $4-5 a barrel. Thats not very impressive.Nevertheless, the results beat street expectations.IOCs operating profit increased by one-third, compared with the same period last year to Rs.13,683 crore. HPCLs operating profit increased 17% year-on-year to Rs.3,627 crore, while BPCLs operating profit increased at a much slower pace of 3% to Rs.3,919 crore.Reported net profit of IOC, HPCL and BPCL increased 25%, 30% and 11%, respectively, to Rs.8,269 crore, Rs.2,098 crore and Rs.2,620 crore.What next after a great quarter? Investors in these stocks have little to complain. Higher visibility on profits thanks to reforms in the sector, benefits from lower crude price and robust demand have helped sentiment. So far this year, shares of these companies have outperformed the Sensex meaningfully. Currently, BPCL, HPCL and IOC trade at 11 times, nine times and 10 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year.Even as valuations do not appear demanding, the outlook isnt the brightest. Spark Capital believes OMCs earnings have peaked out in fiscal 2016 and sees risks to 2HFY17/FY18E earnings. Some factors that pose risks, according to the brokerage, include weaker GRMs and narrowing of trade discounts offered by West Asian suppliershitting GRMs and normalization in marketing margins of auto fuels.Further, while the June quarter was supported by strong inventory gains, a similar support in the current quarter is unlikely. In fact, it is possible that the June quarter ends up being the best quarter for this year. Given this and the sharp run-up in the stocks, upsides in the OMC stocks could be capped.",2016-09-04,vwgz8rEb7fUq3xkuRqZFXK,"While the June quarter was supported by strong inventory gains, a similar support in the current quarter is unlikely, according to some analysts",competitor,20:18,Inventory gains boost oil marketing companies in June quarter

-0.79,"After Max Financial Services Ltd announced its swap ratio with HDFC Life Insurance Ltd last month, the formers shares now reflect the value of the combined entity. As such, investors can already get a clean, direct exposure to one of the countrys largest insurance plays through Max. Even so, there has been a fair bit of excitement around the insurance sector, and even though ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd may have lost the first-mover advantage to HDFC, its initial public offering (IPO) is expected to be received well.
				   
				To start with, it has been valued at a 10-20% discount to the HDFC-Max combine, according to calculations by Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd. At the price band of Rs300-324 per share, the life insurer is valued at Rs43,060-47,957 crore. Nomura Securities puts the insurers embedded value (EV) for fiscal year 2018 at Rs17,520 crore and the IPO price would be a multiple of 2.5-2.7 times estimated FY18 EV.Recall that the merger of HDFC Life-Max Life Ltd last month had valued HDFC Life at Rs45,687 crore and the merged entity at Rs66,508 crore. Analysts peg the FY18 EV of the merged company at Rs21,290 crore that puts the transaction at a multiple of 3.5 of EV. But Nomuras analysts say that after adjusting for cost synergies expected from the HDFC Life-Max merger and after excluding excess capital, ICICI Prudentials valuations are at 2.9-3.2 times EV, and HDFC-Maxs valuation stands at 3.6 times.Note that ICICI Prudential has the highest proportion of revenue coming from unit-linked insurance plans (Ulips)they account for 82% of its new business premium. Ulips are cyclical and so some of the key ratios could be prone to its vagaries. Analysts at Nomura also note that ICICI Prudentials new business profit is lower than peers that have bank-led insurance models. Besides, a relatively low proportion of its premium is related to the protection business, which also results in lower margins. As such, its not surprising that the ICICI Prudential IPO has been priced much cheaper vis-à-vis the HDFC-Max combine. Also note that when juxtaposed with the earlier stake sale of ICICI Bank to Temasek and PremjiInvest, its valuations look dearer. ICICI Bank sold a 6% stake for around Rs1,950 crore valuing the insurer at Rs32,500 crore. This is at a multiple of 1.85 of the FY18 EV. As pointed earlier, what will help from a demand perspective is that insurance penetration in India is still low. Premium as a percentage of gross domestic product was a mere 2.7% in calendar year 2015. The potential is there for private insurers to milk this opportunity.",2016-09-14,w5NYbmQwG5jHMVJSXtOE0N,"Even though ICICI Prudential Life Insurance may have lost the first-mover advantage to HDFC, its IPO is expected to be received well",both,00:52,ICICI Prudentials IPO: A good bet on insurance
-0.17,"New Delhi: Putting speculation to rest, filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali joined hands with Viacom18 Motion Pictures for his epic project Padmavati in October. Scheduled for a 17 November, 2017 release, the estimated budget of the Ranveer Singh, Shahid Kapoor and Deepika Padukone-starrer is around Rs180 crore, making it one of Indias most expensive movie productions, said trade experts who declined to be named. About Rs150 crore has been set aside for production and the remaining for promotions, advertising and other expenses.
				   
				Media reports in the past two months suggested that the film would mark the unique collaboration of two major Bollywood corporate housesEros International that had backed the previous two films directed by Bhansali, Bajirao Mastani and Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela, and Viacom with which he had co-produced Mary Kom and Gabbar Is Back. But Eros backed out of the deal in October, industry experts say, because of a financial crunch. Eros International Plc.s stock has fallen since August this year. Its shares, as of Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, reads last traded at $18.13 apiece, down from $19.23 apiece on 8 August . Bombay Stock Exchange listed Eros International Media Ltd stock witnessed a sharper fall in the same period, falling to Rs176.90 on Friday from Rs230 apiece on 8 August. Padmavati is the second film that Eros has let go of recently; it earlier backed out of Ajay Devgn-starrer Shivaay, which also had a budget of over Rs100 crore. The studio declined to comment for this story.The deal makes sense for Viacom despite the massive budget, say trade experts. For one, it involves Bhansali, who is riding high on the Rs184 crore net box office collections of Bajirao Mastani. A director is always assured a budget equal to the recovery that his last film made. The challenge is to go beyond that and there is always about 10-20% risk for the studio involved, said Jayantilal Gada, chairman of film-producing and presenting company Pen India. Plus with him (Bhansali), its a case of take it or leave it. Look at any of his films and you can see the money spent on every scene, they are all meant to be big screen experiences.To be sure though, in absolute terms, Padmavati will have to equal the Rs500 crore plus gross collections of war epic Baahubali: The Beginning to recover the investment, said Atul Mohan, editor of trade magazine Complete Cinema, given obstacles like rising ticket prices and rampant piracy in the movie business.He is a very sensible director and you definitely need these larger-than-life films once in a while to provide variety for audiences. But the Indian box office is highly unpredictable and a big-budget film gone wrong can totally break a studio as the examples of Mohenjo Daro and Bombay Velvet show, Mohan said. Viacom shelled out about Rs40 crore for the satellite rights of Bhansalis Bajirao Mastani. The Rs150 crore production budget for Padmavati means that Viacom will spend about Rs75 crore from its own funds and the remaining will come as loans from banks. A mere Rs35 crore extra would give them rights to a Bhansali film that would, as most people agree, stand a class apart. Plus there are a variety of revenue streams available for Viacom to recover its investment in Padmavati.Earlier films were dependent on theatrical, music and satellite rights for earnings. Now there is such a huge revenue proposition in the form of digital apps, every mobile is a shop now, said Sanjay Bhandari, a financial adviser to the film industry.Viacom especially stands to benefit thanks to its video-on-demand service Voot, a joint venture with Reliance Industries Ltd, which in September launched its telecom operation. The studio remained unavailable for comment.Producers arent just looking at recovery on the table now, at least 30-40% of the recovery happens after the release.

-0.82,"The largest venture capital fund ever raised by a woman isnt in Silicon Valley or even the US. Its in Beijing and is run by a former librarian who keeps such a low profile that shes a mystery in her native China. Chen Xiaohong rarely attends industry conferences or events. She hadnt given a media interview in more than a decade until agreeing to break her silence this summer. I dont like being part of a club, said Chen during a four-hour discussion at her firms headquarters. I believe in staying independent, making your own decisions.
				   
				Chen, 46, is part of an unusual group of female investors who have risen to the top of the venture business in China and helped fuel the countrys technology boom. Theyve backed some of Chinas most successful start-ups and their influence is growing as they raise more money, recruit other women and seed the next generation of technology companies.Chen and her peers have become part of the mainstream in China in a way thats proven elusive in the US American venture firms have faced accusations of sexism and discrimination for years, including in an unsuccessful lawsuit filed by a female partner against storied Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Despite the criticism, the firms have made little progress in promoting women. Among the top US venture firms, women make up about 10% of the investing partners and only half of the firms have any women of that rank. China is already more balanced: About 17% of investing partners are female and 80% have at least one woman.An increasing number, like Chen, lead their firms. Kathy Xu is founder of Shanghais Capital Today Group, which has $1.2 billion under management and was an early backer of the e-commerce company JD.com Inc. Anna Fang is CEO of ZhenFund, one of the most influential angel investors in China. Ruby Lu, Chens partner at her firm H Capital until this month, previously co-founded the China business for Doll Capital Management. Their success is bringing more women into Chinas technology industry. The Chinese government estimates females found 55% of new Internet companies and more than a quarter of all entrepreneurs are women. In the US, only 22% of start-ups have one or more women on their founding teams, according to research by Vivek Wadhwa and Farai Chideya for their book Innovating Women: The Changing Face of Technology. Chen and her colleagues are building on a tradition of opportunity for women in China that dates back to before the days when Mao Zedong declared they held up half the sky. Women worked out of necessity in fields and factories when the country was poor, and fought alongside men during the countrys civil war. By comparison, collaborating in an office is simple. Lus mother, who served in the Peoples Liberation Army, laughed when she heard about her daughters diversity training at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. She said Thats ridiculous. Whats your job got to do with women or men? The country is hardly free from discrimination. Men still hold most positions of power in politics and business, and theres plenty of crude sexism in technology. But China has quietly become one of the best places in the world for women venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. Chen raised a new $500 million fund, the biggest ever by a woman, according to Preqin, and increased her assets under management to about $1 billion. The largest women-led fund in the US was about half that size, according to Preqins data.China is fundamentally different, said Gary Rieschel, an American who founded the China-based Qiming Venture Partners, where four of the nine investing partners are female. The venture capital industry in the U.S. has been a private mens club. It has been much more of a meritocracy for women in China. H Capital is based in a modern tower in the northeast corner of Beijing overlooking the new diplomatic district. The airy offices have wood floors and white brick walls, and a more casual vibe than the firms on Sand Hill Road in Silicon Valley. One wall is decorated with a framed charcoal drawing of a menacing-looking robot by one of Chens children.Chen agreed to an interview after prodding from Lu, her former partner. Despite Chens penchant for privacy, Lu argued that women have the best chance to excel by helping each other and sharing experiences of victory and defeat. They sank into brightly coloured bean bag chairs, where the partners usually meet with entrepreneurs and investors, and talked over fresh-cut watermelon and mineral water. I like to bring everyone down to floor level, joked Lu.Chen was hardly destined for greatness. She grew up in Hubei Province, in a city famous for its gymnasts. Her parents, a high school teacher and an accountant, were neither rich nor politically connected. She was nonetheless a gifted student who got into Chinas top university and won a rare full scholarship for graduate school in America, the chance for a better life.She nearly blew it. Lonely and homesick, she abandoned the prestigious grant to join Chinese friends at Rutgers University in New Jersey. The only course available was in library science, so she studied to be a librarian. In my heart, I knew I wouldnt be an academic, Chen said.After finishing her degree, Chen answered a help wanted ad in the New York Times for a librarian at the New York media merchant bank Veronis Suhler Stevenson LLC in 1994. She got the job and in those early Internet days she managed file cabinets full of corporate records. Her meticulous company reports soon drew the attention of CEO John Suhler. She added new meaning to the word diligent and to the words due diligence, said Suhler. She was better than any of our MBA associates.Chen was called XC because her colleagues didnt understand the order of Chinese names and she was reticent to correct them. Suhler eventually promoted her to work on deals. He kept sending me requests after hed read a clip in the paper, Chen said. She was the only Chinese woman at the firm.It has been much more of a meritocracy for women in ChinaChen gained confidence as she gained experience. She worked on some 45 publishing and education deals, and was promoted again, this time to managing director. She met Tiger Global founder Chase Coleman in 2003 through mutual connections. He originally recruited her to work at a Chinese e-commerce company he had invested in called Joyo.com. It turned out that Joyo.coms CEO was her old high school classmate Lei Jun, who would later become one of the most successful entrepreneurs in Asia as founder of Xiaomi Corp. She returned to China in February 2004 to help the company raise money, but the plans changed when the board decided to sell to Amazon.com Inc.Still, Coleman saw Chens potential. They began discussions for her to launch an investment fund specializing in education. Even before she was formally hired, she hit the road to meet with about 70 companies. In October 2004, she officially joined Tiger.It was an opportune time. China under Communist rule had shunned capitalist practices like private business and Wall Street-style finance. But Deng Xiaoping led a wave of market reforms in the 1980s and with the dot-com boom at the turn of the century, entrepreneurs and venture investors were scrambling to make their fortunes. Few Chinese had been trained in finance, men or women, so the field was wide open for Chen and her peers. When China got going, there just werent that many people, said Qimings Rieschel.One of Chens first investments in 2004 was in New Oriental Education & Technology Group, a provider of test preparation and foreign language courses that was looking to expand. Chens college English professor helped start the company and she saw the prospects for private education in China. My whole generation was basically mentored by New Oriental, she said. New Oriental went public in 2006 and the shares quadrupled in a year. She had made her first fortune at Tiger.Xiaohong is a terrific investor, said Coleman in an email. Her capacity to navigate the Chinese investment landscape and its many nuances is second to none.She also invested in JD.com when it was an upstart in the shadow of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Sensing the companys margins could grow sharply if they reached a large enough scale, she agreed to a valuation that surprised the tech community. Everyone thought we were crazy, everyone thought they would die, she said. When we looked at it we saw only potential. E-commerce is a pure economies of scale game.Through it all, she raised three children. Her work habits would have been unusual, if not unacceptable, in the West. She brought her first-born son to the office every day for three years. She didnt have a nanny or a helper so he came to virtually every meeting she had, crawling on conference tables and scribbling on walls. She says that bringing her children helped build a bond with many of the entrepreneurs she backed. Her son did cry and disrupt meetings, but that didnt stop her. It gave her a chance to develop a more personal relationship with founders.She thinks being a woman gave her another advantage: It was easier for her to tell an entrepreneur he was wrong than a male investor. Its very politically incorrect to say this, but as a woman I can say things, they do show a special respect for women. Because its seen as motherly, you can be much more stern.There were many role models, which was helpful when I started a familyChen has set an example thats made an impact on younger generations. For me, there were many role models, which was helpful when I started a family and was worried about how to manage being a mom and running a fund, said Fang of ZhenFund. Fang points to Chen as one of the models that convinced her she could balance the rigorous demands of her job with the role of being a mother.Now, as these women rise through the ranks of venture capital and private equity, they are working to make sure more can follow in their footsteps. Fangs nine-member investment team has four women and theyve put money into more than 30 start-ups founded or co-founded by women. She is part of a group of more than 150 young female venture capitalists on a WeChat social messaging group. Shes also the only woman on a five-person panel judging startups on Im a Unicorn, Chinas version of the television show Shark Tank.Sally Shan, former head of Asia Pacific technology investment banking at JPMorgan & Chase Co., is now managing director of the $37 billion HarbourVest Partners and runs a college mentoring program to encourage female entrepreneurs. Lu, whos known Shan from her banker days, is a frequent lecturer there. Were building a community, said Lu. From the upstream limited partners, endowment world, family offices, to the general partners, theres a lot of females in China that are extremely competent.Sexism still seeps into the industry. Chinese technology companies have made a habit of inviting Japanese porn stars to corporate events. One local Internet company hired cheerleaders to provide programmers with extra motivation. Men also lead the biggest venture firms and hold the vast majority of partnership posts, even if it is less than in the US. Its dangerous to say the field is completely even, because especially in tech, at least at the operational level, there is a huge gender issue, said Rui Ma, partner for 500 Startups, a Silicon Valley-based fund. She often finds herself the only women at industry panels. I also have had friends who are female and who are single who are aspiring founders who have been rejected for funding on the basis of their gender, and been told so point blank.Back at H Capitals headquarters in Beijing, where Chen seems to relish spending hours in bean bag chairs thinking and talking, she admits her own views on women have evolved. She used to believe women didnt have the broad vision for greatness that defines outstanding entrepreneurs. Not anymore. Today, there are more and more female entrepreneurs that have totally changed my view, she said. They have great vision. Bloomberg",2016-09-20,wB6pCr2ZfLFF3AVEzPnTGI,"About 17% of investing partners in China are female and 80% have at least one woman

				Vijayakumars challenge will be to bring HCL back on the growth path and fill the void left by former CEO Anant Gupta. Edited excerpts from an interview:What will be your focus area as the new CEO?One very important thing that we have articulated to the market is our Mode 123 strategy. This is all about how we can map the customer spend and fine-tune our services to make it relevant to the spend. We have mode 1 services which are traditional services such as infrastructure, application, engineering services and BPO (business process outsourcing). These are momentum services and we believe these markets are still under-served. Only 49% of global 2,000 companies have outsourced. Then still there are a lot of re-bid opportunities, $150 billion worth of re-bid is on and year on year its $40-50 billion. Its a big opportunity.You have made niche acquisitions such as those of Volvo for automotive and Butler America for aerospace. Are you more focused on gaining technology instead of acquiring customers?We want to focus on intellectual property (IP). If you want to future-proof your business, I think products and IPs are very important, so whether you can overnight build products and IPs of very high valueno. By this partnership and niche acquisitions, we will start building it in the long term. I think its really a very important strategy for us.Are you planning to appoint a new head of the infrastructure business, and will the COO position be filled?Its something I have to think about. Its too early. But we have a very strong leadershipsales leaders, delivery leaders and HCL has always boasted of strong leadership pipeline. I think, I am pretty comfortable with the momentum and we are pretty optimistic for the overall outlook.So, can I say that the COO position was created to help you transition to the CEO post?You can take it like that. It was a part of succession planning.You have chalked out a partnership with IBM. What gains are you expecting from this, considering that IBM is also a competitor?Competition is in certain space. In the IT space, there are lots of opportunities. They have a huge software business. So, there are good IPs that can be potentially looked at and thats what we have done. And then they are also a very large PaaS (platform-as-a-service) provider, like Bluemix is a big PaaS service. Some of our modern applications can be built on Microsoft Azure or IBM Bluemix.You have been defocusing on the India market. Will that continue?Yes, we are not focusing on the India market. It will continue to come down.With a 2.8% quarterly growth and a soft second half, will you be able to achieve the 12-14% target in 2016-17?We had a 6% revenue growth in the first quarter, we have 2.8% in the second quarter, so we are clear on what the run rate is. It is between 2% and 3% to get to the 12-14%. So far, from whatever we know, we feel confident to achieve that target.While many IT peers have hired outsiders in order to transform themselves, you are a 22-year company veteran. Do you feel confident to bring new ideas?Each core business has got very strong leadership. We continue to hire from outside also. So, it gives a good mix of external and internal view. In a large company, to really drive, you need to understand the internals of the company.

				The comments come as Trump, in his first news conference as president-elect on Wednesday, promised a major punitive border tax on products manufactured by US companies shifting jobs outside the US, underlining that job creation at home would be one of his priorities.Previously, the US president-elect had listed immigration reform among five executive actions he plans to take on his first day in office. They include asking the Department of Labor to investigate all abuses of the visa programmes that undercut the American worker.Also read: The challenges to free movement of labourIn his confirmation hearing, Sessions said: Its simply wrong to think that were in a totally open world and that any American with a job can be replaced if somebody in the world is willing to take a job for less pay. We have borders. We have a commitment to our citizens and you have been a champion of that. Ive been honoured to work with you on it, Sessions said in response to a question from senator Charles Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.Under the H1B visa programme, US-based companies hire highly skilled foreign workers, up to a maximum of 85,000 a year65,000 hired abroad and 20,000 from among foreign nationals studying in the US.The H1B visas are used by companies hiring Indian techies while the L1 is used for intra-company transfers.  The multibillion-dollar Indian IT industrys exports are worth $108 billion, 60% of which goes to the US market.Also read: Trump effect? Bill targeting H1B visas reintroduced in US CongressIn New Delhi, Shivendra Singh, vice-president in charge of global trade development at the National Association of Software and Services Companies or Nasscom, said the trade body would work to dispel the perception that Indian IT professionals were eating into the US jobs market. The top seven Indian companies account for just 13% of the H1B and L1 visas issued every year, he said, adding that the rest are used by major US companies who hire Indian IT professionals.The fact is that the Indian IT sector is a net jobs creator in the US, Singh said. We support more than 400,000 jobs in the US, we contribute $20 billion as taxes to the US economy and we play a role in making America more competitive, he said.  Singh also cited the US Labor Department figures to buttress the argument that a shortage of skilled workers within the US labour pool was what was causing Indian as well as US companies to hire Indian IT professionals. According to Singh, the US Labor Department had itself predicted a shortage of 2.4 million STEM or science, technology, engineering and mathematics graduates till 2018. We want to hire locally but there is a shortage of skilled labour. This is why US companies are also hiring Indian workers, he said.If the H1B and LI visas are given on the basis of skill, then we are fine with that, he said. We are also supportive of US efforts to create more jobs, he said.With the US and India looking to boost trade from the current $100 billion to $500 billion (set by India and the US during a visit to New Delhi in 2013 by the outgoing US vice-president Joe Biden), Singh said the IT industry was seen as one of the key drivers of this.The Indian IT industry has in the past too been a target of  US politicians who blame it for taking away jobs.In 2015, during US president Barack Obamas second term in office, India had protested the increase in H1B and L1 visa fees from $2000 and $2,500 respectively to $4000 and $4500 respectively. The steep hikes were justified by the US administration to finance more security posts on the US-Mexico border and for the creation of a special fund for the victims of the 9/11 attacks in the US in 2001.Sessionss comments on the H1B and L1 visas come as two Republican lawmakers from California on 5 January re-introduced a bill in the US Congress that backs  key changes in the H1B programme, news reports said.  Among other things, the bill aims to increase the minimum salary of H1B visa to $100,000 per annum from the current levels of $60,000 per annum.",2017-01-12,wM8JqbZmNrXXGeeLMjYD5J,Jeff Sessions assures US lawmakers of taking steps to curb misuse of H1B visassignificantly used by Indiazn IT professionals that allegedly replace US workers,both,12:08,H1B visas under scrutiny as Team Trump vows crack down on misuse
-0.34,"Mumbai/New Delhi: Tata Motors Ltd on Monday posted a quarterly profit but missed the analysts earnings estimates by a wide margin because of currency hedging losses at its UK Jaguar Land Rover unit following the nations decision to leave the European Union.
				   
				The Mumbai-based company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs848 crore in the three months ended 30 September compared with a loss of Rs1,740 crore in the year-ago period. The company still missed the Rs2,758.3 crore profit estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 24 analysts.Tata Motors said that higher sales volume at its Jaguar Land Rover unit was offset by the realized hedging losses of  Rs3,510 crore and adverse commodity derivatives impact of Rs187 crore.The Brexit effect has led to unintended losses for the last two quarters on the companys hedges, said Mahantesh Sabarad, deputy head of research (equity), SBI Cap Securities Ltd. Hedging losses on the account of Jaguar Land Rover was £123 million (about Rs1,050 crore) during the preceding June quarter.Fiscal second-quarter consolidated revenue grew by 6.94% to Rs67,000 crore, in line with analysts estimates of Rs67,061.4 crore.The numbers reflect strong sales of Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles across all its markets in the UK, Europe, North America, China and other markets, the company said.The performance of its India business deteriorated further because of a decline in sales of its medium and heavy commercial vehicles. Tata Motorss loss, excluding its units, widened to Rs631 crore during the quarter from Rs289 crore in the year earlier. Revenue of the standalone business also declined to Rs11,406 crore in the September quarter from Rs11,794 crore in the year-ago period.This comes despite the company reporting higher sales in segments such as light commercial vehicles, passenger vehicles and exports.Passenger vehicles sales grew 20.5% from a year earlier, while car sales rose 26.4% because of demand for its recently launched Tiago model. Exports grew 20.1% from a year earlier. These were more than offset by degrowth of 16.5% y-o-y in the M&HCV segment, the company said in a statement.Led by the introduction of new models and a pick-up in China sales, volumes at the companys UK subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover grew 29.3% to 142,459 units, reflecting strong sales of the Discovery, Discovery Sport, Evoque, XE and the new F-Pace. Retail sales grew across all key regions. North American sales rose 39%, the UK 28%, China 49% and Europe 31%, the company said.Tatas profit margin may improve in coming quarters as a lower British pound starts to buoy translated revenue from overseas sales, according to Steve Man, senior industry analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Production of two Land Rover SUVs by the joint venture with Chinas Chery is ramping up and should aid margin expansion, Man said.

-0.25,"Mumbai:  The Tata group fracas appears to have shed all earthly inhibitions and gone to a galaxy far, far away. In this Star Wars space opera, Cyrus Mistry, the recently ousted chairman, was Sith Lord Darth Vader who had brainwashed the PR folk  the old and venerable conglomerates noble Jedi warriors  and used them to smother criticism of his performance.
				   
				Thats probably why a 24 September Economist report, titled Mistrys Elephant, which was denounced by the group for drawing preconceived conclusions based on an inappropriate interpretation of selected data, was on Thursday extolled by the same people for being really a well-balanced and critical review.Not just that. Thursdays press statement ticked off the groups PR machineryin other words, itselffor dismissing views that did not toe the line being peddled by Bombay House, Tatas headquarters. Even the author of the Economist report is baffled by the sudden change of heart.Stanley Pignal @spignal Im fascinated to see Tata denouncing its own PR machines response to my recent article. Odd given PR side is/was https://t.co/gCbxA6z7EB Twitter: Stanley Pignal on TwitterAs for investors who have seen more than $12 billion of their Tata group wealth vanish since 24 October, the day Ratan Tata reclaimed control, only three questions really matter:Whos the Chosen One to restore balance to the Force? How many episodes are left? Wheres the popcorn?The answer to the first is far from obvious. Ratan Tatas camp is now accusing Mistry of trying to hijack control of operating companies in the $100 billion salt-to-software conglomerate. Mistrys side says the allegations are untrue. Tata is mocking Mistrys poor leadership for botching up Tata Steel Ltds UK operations, claiming that the Scunthorpe steel plant it sold in May to Greybull Capital LLP for 1 British pound has since seen a dramatic turnaround. Mistry, on the other hand, blames Ratan Tatas $12.9 billion purchase of Corus Group Plcs steel assets in 2007 for the groups debt overhang.Tata Consultancy share-price declined 13% since Ratan returned . Since Ratan Tata is back only in an interim capacity, the group needs a new chairman to end the spat. But until Mistry agrees to sell his familys 18.4% holding in Tata Sons Ltd., the holding company, the lightsabers wont get turned off. Its unlikely that the CEO of a global corporation would want to jump into the fray as Luke Skywalkerand get his or her reputation fried in the process. Besides, after Tata Groups press statement accused Mistry of dismantling structures put in place by visionary founders and generations of Tatas, its not even clear if the group wants to be anything other than a family-run enterprise.Its a much more than just a war of words. Ratan Tata is trying to evict Mistry from the boards of operating companies, but its proving to be far from easy thanks to a few independent directors whore supporting Mistry. But are those directors taking up the cudgels to uphold corporate governance standards, or are they simply trying to avoid the embarrassment of firing a chairman after showering praises on him?Like in everything else with the Tata Wars, its impossible to establish whos with the Force and whos gone over to the Dark Side. Or for that matter, how many more episodes are left in the sordid saga. The best investors can hope for is that until the group makes up its mind on whether it wants to slash debt, gun for growth, or do a bit of both, Tata Consultancy Services , the groups ATM, will keep coughing up more cash so Bombay House can fully engage in the tussle for control.

				The bank cut the interest rate on home loans up to Rs 75 lakh to 9.20% from 9.35% for male customers. The interest rate for women has been lowered to 9.15% from 9.30%. For underprivileged customers, loans up to Rs25 lakh have been repriced to 9.15% from 9.30% earlier. The new rates became applicable starting 1 November, the bank said in a notification on its website.One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. The reduction in home loan rates follows ICICI Banks 10 bps rate cut in the one-year marginal cost based lending rate (MCLR), reduced to 8.95% on 28 October.ALSO READ | This or that: floating rate or fixed rate for a home loan?The private sector lenders move is in response to the new home loan rates announced by State Bank of India (SBI).Indias largest lender has cut its home loan rate to 9.15%, a cut of about 15 bps. Home loan rates for SBIs women customers has been dropped to 9.1%.The new rates are being offered under SBIs festive season offer. The state-owned bank is also offering a waiver on processing fees on home loans for customers who want to buy SBI approved projects and are applying online, those who want to transfer their home loans to the bank, and certain government employees.The housing finance market is currently dominated by SBI, which had a home loan portfolio worth Rs1.97 trillion, as on 30 June. In comparison, ICICI Bank had a home loan portfolio worth Rs1.13 trillion at the end of the first quarter.ALSO READ | Banks cut lending and deposit ratesAccording to Sumit Bali, senior executive vice-president and head-personal assets at Kotak Mahindra Bank, lenders have been passing on the benefit of falling interest rates in the system to their retail and small and medium enterprises (SME) customers over the last few months and the festive season should see more such offers coming up.Between August and September, Kotak Mahindra Bank ran a special monsoon offer where it waived processing fees for home loan customers who were also given an interest rate of 9.35% on their new loans. According to Bali, the bank may look at reintroducing these offers, depending on market conditions. Our six-month MCLR, which is the basic rate on which we price our home loans, is at about 9.2%. Presently, we are charging a premium of about 5 bps and we can reduce it to nil, depending on the customer profile. We wouldnt want to lose our customers over a 5-10 bps difference, he added.As experts see it, lenders will be using festive season demand as a means to prop up their lending portfolios which have been growing slowly over the most of this financial year. As of now, lenders are being quite selective in announcing festive offers. As corporate loan growth has been lagging for many quarters now, home finance seems to be the safest growth option for banks. Whether these rate reductions would go beyond the festive season, will determine if we are in a rate war- type situation, said Karthik Srinivasan, senior vice-president and co-head of financial sector ratings firm Icra Ltd.According to fortnightly data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), as on 14 October, the outstanding non-food credit for the banking system was reported at Rs72.7 trillion, showing only a 9% year-on-year growth.In comparison, home loans have been showing a growth of at least 18-20% year-on-year for the past many months and stood at over Rs8 trillion at the end of September, RBI data shows.

				Lower lending rates have long been seen as a needed boost to Indias economy, which grew at a 15-month low in the April-June quarter, in part due to a dearth of corporate investment.Tuesdays withdrawal of Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes, aimed at curbing corruption and counterfeit currency, has sparked long lines of people looking to exchange their worthless notes.State Bank of India (SBI), Indias largest lender by assets, said on Friday it had already received Rs18,000 crore ($2.68 billion) in savings and current account deposits since Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the measure.Also Read: Why are ATMs still out of service and out of cash ?Economists at SBI estimate banks will receive an influx of Rs5,07,000 crore in cash, of which 10% is likely to be left at lenders. That type of influx could allow banks to lower their deposit rates, and in turn, their lending ratesproviding a vital deployment of credit.What I do in a month, Ive done in a day, said SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya, regarding the influx of low-cost deposits. Surely the cost of funds is something that is going to ease, she said, adding the bank believed that would result in a fall in lending rates.Banking shares have surged, with SBI up 11.3% in the two days after the announcement, although it fell 3% on Friday.Also Read: Rs500, Rs1000 note ban: Tax evaders engaging in illegal transactions on I-T dept radarMuch will depend on how many deposits end up actually coming in, but there is room for hope.

				Appirio helps companies move applications to hosted servers offered by Amazon, Google and Salesforce.com.The privately held company, founded in 2006, has raised more than $110 million from investors including Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic, and counts Facebook, Home Depot and IBM as its clients. It is estimated to have revenue of more than $200 million.Wipro chief executive officer Abidali Z. Neemuchwala said it is important for companies to transform the way they engage with customers and employees by leveraging the power of the cloud. Since Neemuchwala joined the company in April last year, Wipro has spent $1.13 billion to buy four companies, including Appirio.Wipro spent $95 million in July 2015 to buy Denmark-based design firm Designit, with a revenue of $30 million, to give a boost to its newly created business division, Wipro Digital.In December, it paid $78 million to buy Cellent, a German technology company with over $90 million in revenue, that implements and maintains SAP software for clients in automobile and manufacturing segments. In February, Wipro paid $460 million to buy HealthPlan Services, a Florida, US-based technology firm that brings over $220 million in business by offering solutions to health insurance firms. Wipro also tried buying Viteos Group but later called off the buyout, citing inordinate delays in the completion of the acquisition. The Times of India first reported the Appirio deal.Wipros decision to buy Appirio mirrors the approach followed by its larger peers Accenture Plc. and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM). Accenture bought Salesforce partner, Cloud Sherpas in September last year while IBM bought Salesforce partner Bluewolf Group in April this year.This deal is about giving Wipro the capabilities to scale out IT services in the cloud world. What it gains are some strong methodologies in delivering in the cloud, and  significant partnerships such as Workday, Salesforce, Amazon, and Google, said Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm.More importantly, Wipro can take those methodologies and scale out to adjust for building revenue in the cloud.

-0.55,"A conversation with Pawan Goenka is always a delight. Not because he is Indian automobile industrys Carlos Ghosnwho single-handedly built what is todays Renault-Nissan Allianceand Anand Mahindras go-to man, but because he is full of stories and a great storyteller.
				   
				After a 90-minute interview at Mahindra Towers in Worli, Mumbai, as Goenka, executive director of auto conglomerate Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd, plans to wrap up for the day, I ask him to tell me how it all began.A  self-confessed introvert, Goenka studied at the Hindi-medium Shree Jain Vidyalaya in Kolkata. His family had moved to that city from a small village, Harpalpur, in Madhya Pradesh. That meant his English was far from impeccable. But Goenka didnt let that clip his ambitions. After graduating in mechanical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, Goenka enrolled at Cornell University in the US for a PhD. He has been a hot hire in global automotive circles since.  His first employer, General Motors,  which he joined days before he was to join AT&T, helped him polish his English. Years later, the Delhi-based Lal familys Eicher and Mahindra both offered him jobs, in December 1992. He joined Mahindra. Everything is an accident. It was because of Air India, my mother and Babri Masjid. Goenka says about the start of his association with Mahindra & Mahindra. Dressed in a white shirt and a navy-blue suit, he relaxes into a chair in the empty office as it pours outside.After numerous phone calls asking him to wrap up the interview, he looks at his watch, and maintains this will have to be the last story. When he was in the US, Goenka would come to India once every three years for a holiday; it was on one of these visits that he applied to a few companies for jobs. They called him for interviews.My mother was very possessive; whenever I was in Kolkata, I couldnt go anywhere else. I had to be with her. She allowed me to go for the interviews only if I could go in the morning and return in the evening. So Goenka looked at the airline schedule. Air India was on strike, and running a skeleton programme. The only place I could go from Kolkata to some place and come back the same day was Mumbai. And the only company in Mumbai that had invited me was Mahindra.The day I came here (Mumbai), there was a Mumbai bandh because of the Babri Masjid demolitions. To Goenkas surprise, a young 30-something Anand Mahindra was still on time to interview him. Goenka, was in his late 30s then, had already made his mark by designing FLARE, a piece of software for GM that housed all the engine component designs of the automaker (it is still in use). He was impressed by Mahindras vision and accepted their offer.Siddharth Lal, the Eicher Motors Ltd chief executive who single-handedly revived one of the worlds most loved brands, Royal Enfield, still rues not being able to hire Goenka. We, too, had made an offer to him. You can ask him about that, Lal once told me.Goenka continues the story. Just three days ago, I was going through some of my old papers in an old file where I found a piece of paper where I had written down the Eicher offer and the Mahindra offer. I had come for a CTC of about Rs3 lakh at Mahindra at that time, leaving a job of $120,000 (around Rs80 lakh now; at GM), he says.Goenka joined Mahindra in 1993 as head of research and development and helped turn it from a company that was known for making tractors into an auto conglomerate. Mahindra went on to make some of the most rugged utility vehicles, such as the Scorpio and the Bolero. Mahindra bought the beleaguered Korean automobile company SsangYong and, with Goenka leading the way, turned it around. Today, keen to make its mark globally, it has branched out into two-wheelers, commercial vehicles, passenger vehicles and premium vehicles. Mahindra now wants to build Indias first luxury vehicle under the Pininfarina brandan Italian design house that they acquired last year. From being called the father of FLARE at GM, Goenka is now known as the father of the Scorpio.And indeed, long before Anand Mahindra hired him, GM had realized his potential. It was Goenkas first job, and he spent 14 years there. GM happened in a very funny way. I have not told this story before, he tells me. In 1978, Goenka was to confirm his joining at AT&T on a Friday and he got a call from GM on Monday. He appeared for the interview on Tuesday and had the offer letter in hand on Wednesday. Getting a job in the US in those days was difficult; most companies wouldnt offer a job to non-residents if they did not have a green card. Goenka was on a student visa, and GM was initially no different.But then the head of department  changed. He found my application and told HR,  I want to interview this guy. So they said, But he doesnt have a green card. He said, Thats your job. My job is to find the right people. You find a way to get him a green card. Goenka has come a long way since. If you look at leading promoters in India today, I probably know half of them. At some point in life, they have approached me, says Goenka. But he has been with the company for 23 years now, and, most importantly, found a friend in Anand Mahindra.The more people you know, the better it is. There is no doubt about it. Right? But I think what matters more, perhaps, is the depth with which you have a relationship with a friend. A superficial relationship will probably only get you so far. An intimate relationship would be much more helpful, Goenka says.He turned 63 on 23 September and has two years left at Mahindra unless a special resolution extends his tenure.You have made me say a lot of things... You should ask Anand about this one, Goenka says.Any regrets?About moving back to India, absolutely no regrets, he says. Personal life, there are always things that you would think of, you know.... I wish I had done something different. Frankly, if I was to start my kindergarten today, I would probably try and become good in one sport, and one skill. I have no musical skills and sports skills. So thats what I would want to focus on, if I was to start over again.",2016-10-28,wZgVxT0mzzLHvQ7NGPPYLJ,"The executive director of Mahindra & Mahindra on happy accidents, long friendships, and the luxury car theyre planning to launch ",competitor,11:10,Pawan Goenka: The auto pilot

SBIs staff expenses rose to Rs6,257 crore from Rs5,906 crore in the same period.Banks are discussing moving to their own pay structures after the finance ministry asked them to start the process for the 11th bipartite wage pact before the current five-year settlement expires in October 2017.The ministry has asked banks to start early, instead of waiting for the culmination of the current wage pact, an official with the Indian Banks Association (IBA), which groups all banks in India, said on condition of anonymity.As large banks explore the idea of moving to their own pay structure, a few smaller ones including Union Bank, Syndicate Bank and Vijaya Bank have sent their consent to IBA to be a part of the process for negotiating a new wage agreement, added the official.The transition to a productivity-linked settlement is easier said than done. Such a move will face stiff resistance from bank employees unions, which are used to a uniform wage hike.We will oppose a variable pay structure if banks go ahead and introduce this system. We are for more efficiency and productivity, but we dont want differentiation in salary, said C.H, Venkatachalam, general secretary of the All India Bank Employees Association. Bank employees unions have, meanwhile, started preparing a charter of demands that will be submitted to IBA by January 2017.We are looking at an adequate hike in salary this time, in conformity with rising inflation. We are also looking at a higher starting salary for attracting new talent, special facilities for women and improvement in post-retirement benefits, said Venkatachalam.Around one million bank employees across public sector banks, old private sector and a few foreign banks are part of the industry-level wage settlement.According to the 10th bipartite wage settlement, banks and unions agreed to a 15% hike in wages, which resulted in an outgo of Rs5,000 crore for the system. Also agreed to were bank holidays on second and fourth Saturdays.Also, PSU banks have been reeling under losses and mounting NPAs and implementing the variable pay structure may be ill-timed. Concept of variable pay structure is sound. It will encourage employees to make the right decision.

-0.01,"Bengaluru: The Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) in Bengaluru on Thursday ruled in favour of creditors seeking to recover more than Rs9,000 crore in unpaid loans they extended to Vijay Mallyas defunct Kingfisher Airlines Ltd.
				   
				In a 145-page order, the DRTs presiding officer K. Sreenivasan asked a consortium of banks led by State Bank of India (SBI) to start the process of recovering the Rs6,203.35 crore they claimed in 2013, at a yearly interest rate of 11.5%, until the whole amount is paid back.Mallya flew to the UK in March last year as creditors closed in on him. He and his companies Kingfisher Airlines, United Breweries Holdings Ltd and Kingfisher Finvest India Ltd are liable to pay the money that, together with interest, adds up to more than Rs9,000 crore.Businesses should realize that it will be no longer possible for them to avail loans of public money, default in repayment and try to get away through the lanes and by-lanes of twisted facts, the DRT order said.The order brings to an end a three-year legal battle in the tribunal by a consortium of 17 banks seeking to recover the money owed by Kingfisher Airlines, which was grounded in 2012 under the weight of heavy debt and accumulated losses.It allows the lenders to sell properties seized from Mallya to recover the money. SBI and tax authorities have been unable to sell properties such as Kingfisher House in Mumbai, Kingfisher Villa in Goa and Mallyas personal jet, among other possessions, because of high base prices and a weak real estate market. In spite of sale of properties mentioned in the schedule, if the OA (original application) amount is not fully realised then the applicant bank is at liberty to proceed against the person and other properties of the defendants as required under law and also as advised, the DRT order said. Lenders will now have to file a memo with the original claim plus interest and other costs to be recovered from Mallya and his firms, after which the DRT will issue a recovery certificate. The next step is to get a recovery certificate from the DRT so that sale of assets can be pushed for with a shorter notice period, said a senior official at SBI with direct knowledge of the case. He didnt want to be named.We will await a copy of the orders passed by the DRT and file an appeal accordingly, said UB Group spokesperson Sumanto Bhattacharya.The defendants are likely to approach the debt recovery appellate tribunal within 60 days, according to a Bengaluru-based lawyer directly involved in the case who asked not to be named. The order cannot be executed by the banks until the end of the appeal period, which gives Mallya and his firms 60 days to chalk out a strategy, the lawyer said. According to the DRT Act, an appeal can be heard only if the appellantMallya and his companies in this casedeposit 75% of the amount claimed. This amount can be waived or reduced by the judge hearing the case. SBI has written off Rs7,016 crore in loans by 63 wilful defaulters, including Kingfisher Airlines, Daily News & Analysis newspaper reported on 16 November. Finance minister Arun Jaitley said the same day that the write-offs dont mean a loan waiver and that defaulters will be pursued. In March last year, SBI moved DRT for a second time to seek an arrest warrant against Mallya, revocation of his passport, details of his assets and liabilities as well as an order to seize a $75 million payout made to him by spirits maker Diageo Plc. The money, $40 million of which has already been paid to Mallya, was in return for him stepping down as chairman of United Spirits Ltd, which the UK-based company acquired from the businessman.",2017-01-19,whZLP3CTmB7gTuVpk8C5AJ,The Debt Recovery Tribunals order allows the banks to sell wilful defaulter Vijay Mallyas properties to recover the unpaid loans,both,12:54,"DRT allows SBIs plea to recover dues from Vijay Mallya, associated firms"
-0.6,"London:  Ashish Thakkar, who co-founded Africa banking conglomerate Atlas Mara Ltd with ex-Barclays Plc. head Bob Diamond, is a 35-year-old billionaire whose divorce fight has been prolonged, thanks to a complex web of offshore assets. 
				   
				The question of how much Thakkar is worthhe says $541,000 while his wife claims his wealth is far greateris coming under scrutiny in a UK divorce court. A judge in the London family court has denied Thakkars request for a final divorce decree until a determination of his real worth.This is a case where the wife says her husband is a billionaire, judge Philip Moor said in the ruling that shows the difficulty courts have in making a fair assessment of wealth. All the assets are offshore. They are held in very complicated structures that have changed within the recent past. The situation is one where it can be very significant if you are a wife or a former wife.The judges ruling, which was handed down in June and published on the courts website last week, extends a legal battle over the less than five-year marriage that has cast a spotlight on the entrepreneur, whose own foundation has promoted him as Africas youngest billionaire.Financial puzzlesUK judges have become used to unpicking complex webs of offshore assets in high-stakes divorces as spouses sometimes plead net worth far less than what the other spouse claims is their actual fortune. The forensic tracing of assets is a problem that has played out in other scenarios judges have faced across the world from tax avoidance schemes to fraud prosecutions.Based on his disclosed public and closely held assets, Thakkars net worth is valued at $425 million, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His most valuable asset is Ison BPO (Business Process Outsourcing), a UAE-based outsourcing company that operates in Africa and India.Lawyers for Meera Thakkar declined to comment as did a spokesman for Ashish Thakkar. Thakkars lawyers didnt respond to a call seeking comment. In court filings, Thakkar has argued that the beneficiaries of his companies are his mother and sister.While the Thakkar case is at the London high court, similar issues have reached the countrys top court before. The ex-wife of oil trader Michael Prest won a Supreme Court ruling giving her the right to force offshore companies owned by her ex-husband to turn over assets as part of a 17.5 million-pound settlement in 2013. Prests lawyers argued at the time that the courts had no right to pierce the corporate veil of his companies to fund the settlement as they were separate entities and unrelated to the marriage.He was later threatened with up to four weeks in jail for failing to pay his ex-wife 360,000 pounds in 2015 despite his assets being estimated by the judge to be in the region of 37 million pounds.Allegations of hiding assets in divorce cases is nothing new and UK judges have wide discretion to set values as they see fit, according to Graham Coy, a lawyer at Stowe Family Law, who isnt involved in the Thakkar case.If someone is determined to try and hide their assets it is possible, but they could still end up being clobbered in the end anyway because a judge can just take a view on how much theyre worth and if they dont like it, prove it, Coy said.The ex-wife of a property magnate Scot Young told a London judge in one of the highest profile divorce cases in recent years that Young was hiding billions from her while he claimed he was about 28 million pounds in debt.The judge said in the 2013 ruling that Young wasnt a penniless man of straw with huge debts, and that hed hidden from the court about 40 million pounds in assets. Young fell to his death from a fourth-floor window of his flat in London in late 2014.The Supreme Court rolled back two divorce settlements in a 2015 decision that underlined Londons claim to be the divorce capital of the world. The top court ruled two ex-wives are entitled to larger divorce settlements because their husbands hid their true wealth, the decision could pave the way for previous divorce agreements to be revisited many years after they were agreed.Adventures in AfricaThakkars story began in Idi Amins Uganda. His family was among Asian families the dictator expelled in 1972, and moved to the UK, where Thakkar was born. They returned to Africa when he was a child, this time to Rwanda, where his family lost everything during the genocide in 1994, Thakkar says in his 2015 autobiography, The Lion Awakes: Adventures in Africas Economic Miracle.Thakkars own success has prompted him to be branded Africas youngest billionaire. Hes described that way in a 2013 video on a YouTube channel for his charity, the Mara Foundation. He is introduced as that at conferences and asked about it in media interviews.At 15, after the family had returned to Uganda, Thakkar sold a laptop to his dads friend, triggering the realization he could be a trader. His father gave him $5,000 start-up cash, and he started flying to Dubai to buy cheap computer products, which he sold from a tiny shop in central Kampala.He expanded his business by setting up a Dubai-based company. He later started a packaging factory in Uganda and partnered with an Indian Information Technology services company to help them gain entry in new markets across Africa, according to his websites.Thakkar and Diamond met at an event, hit it off and decided that they could start a banking venture together. Thakkar remains a non-executive director with Atlas Mara, which he and Diamond founded with the idea of buying up stakes in banks across sub-Saharan Africa. The company, domiciled in the British Virgin Islands, has raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors through share offerings since 2013.Its important to think big, dream big, but start small, Thakkar says in interviews and speeches. I dont want to bring Silicon Valley to Africa. I want to bring Africa to Silicon Valley. I think its important to be authentic, genuine, real. Bloomberg",2016-10-28,wmRGZq13ETIUlGFEZ4edJI,"Ashish Thakkar, co-founder of Atlas Mara Ltd , is having a prolonged divorce fight thanks to a complex web of offshore assets.

-0.94,"New Delhi: The quest for energy efficiency is transforming Indias Rs15,000 crore a year market for lighting systems. Conventional lamps are being replaced by efficient ones starting from simple LED (light emitting diode) bulbs to sophisticated movement-detecting lighting systems for smart cities and businesses, opening up a host of opportunities to lighting companies from the very bottom of the pyramid to high-end consumers. Harshavardhan Chitale, vice-chairman and managing director of Philips Lighting India Ltd, speaks to Mint about the industrys changing dynamics.
				   
				Edited excerpts from the interview:What is your strategy for growth in India?
We have actively contributed to improving the health of power distribution companies with energy savings. Lighting as a whole contributes to 18-20% of total power consumption in the country. To bridge our energy deficit, we need to either increase power generation or reduce the need for power itself, through energy efficiency. If the entire lighting system of the country is converted into efficient LED lighting or smart connected lighting, our total lighting-related power demand will get reduced by half. It frees up about 30 gigawatt (GW) of our over 300GW generation capacity. That more than bridges our peak power deficit, which is the result of increased power consumption for lighting at peak hours.Secondly, in spite of the drive to electrify all the villages, there will always be parts of India where providing grid-connected power is not economical, as the cost of laying wire will be much more than the cost of power generation. About 20 crore people, or four to five crore households in the country, have either no access to power or get only intermittent supply. Making energy-efficient lighting, especially those run on solar power, available to them will solve our energy access problem.What are the growth opportunities that energy efficiency offers to companies like yours in urban areas?
Home lighting, lights used by businesses and organizations and infrastructure and street lighting are the three major areas of power consumption. India has about three crore street lamps which remain lit for about 10 hours a day, which is a major segment of consumption. For businesses, upgrading to energy-efficient lighting offers a high return on their investment by way of savings in power bill. Payback period for upgrading all lighting systems ranges between two and three years. Almost three-fourth of all new lights bought by businesses are energy-efficient LED lights. There is also a trend among businesses to go for smart lighting, which can sense movement of people and the number of people in the surrounding and produce light accordingly. This intelligent lighting offers about 30% of energy saving in addition to the 50% saving that LEDs per se offer. Some organizations are now getting into what is called managed services. That is, companies like ours upgrade their lighting infrastructure and they pay us in instalments for using that infrastructure. Their savings from power bills helps them pay their instalments to the service provider. Manufacturing companies as well as information technology firms, which are very familiar with the concept of managed services, are going for this.Is smart lighting of streets catching up?
Many states have started to adopt efficient street lamps because of the Smart City initiative, but a lot more is to be done. India has 5,000 towns and at least 100 large cities and three crore street lights. Some cities have upgraded to connected smart street lights. One example is Naya Raipur, the new capital of Chhattisgarh. This city has probably the worlds most modern connected lighting infrastructure that is monitored remotely. The city engineer monitors the infrastructure from his office. If a bulb needs replacement, it gets reported automatically. We are also upgrading the lighting infrastructure of many cities in Tamil Nadu, including Chennai. Finances of the state and the municipalities concerned are important in going for an upgrade. The upgrade is quicker where the municipality concerned has a clear financial model such as central government funding or multilateral aid or lending. Besides energy saving, the cost of maintenance for efficient lights is less and the quality of light is also better.In overseas markets, especially in Europe, we have executed projects where lights remain dim when there is no one in the street and the light intensity goes up when movement of people or vehicle is detected. Indian cities have not gone for this level of sophistication, but the journey has started.The government promotes LED bulbs in a big way. Has it captured the market for home lighting?
In the consumer segment, about 30% of the lights sold today are LED bulbs and the rest are conventional bulbs. The large market share that conventional bulbs still enjoy is not because of any price advantage, but because they are more easily available in the neighbourhood. Its a question of distribution. Some of the LED options are cheaper than conventional bulbs. We need to address this.How can this be tackled?
Firstly, the products that should be adopted have to be of high quality and should be designed for the domestic market with high voltage fluctuation tolerance. Use of poor-quality products can sabotage the adoption of LED bulbs as it would adversely affect public perception of the benefits of energy-efficient products. The next wave of LED adoption will get supported by a robust retailing ecosystem. We go to a nearby retailer to replace a bulb, not to a power distribution utility that stocks these products. The total lighting market in India as per industry estimates is Rs15,000 crore a year. This excludes new pockets of demand such as the remote areas where solar-powered LED bulbs would be required.More than 93% of the lighting equipment that Philips sells in India is designed for India and is made in India.",2016-09-20,woGw5FGjDjQubIV5AEkyaP,"Philips Lighting India MD Harshavardhan Chitale on the lighting industrys changing dynamics

-0.21,"The baton is being passed at ITC Ltd. Executive chairman Y.C. Deveshwar will move to a non-executive chairmans position, making way for a successor. The new chief has not been announced yet, making the transition incomplete. As of now, Deveshwar will guide and mentor a new executive management. The market will be watching to see if this means business as usual or a new ITC could be in the making. The companys share fell by 1.12% on Wednesday.
				   
				The new chief has big shoes to fill. This change comes when its flagship business of cigarettes is facing tough times. Rising excise duties on cigarettes and public health concerns around tobacco pose a serious threat. ITCs cigarette volumes have been declining, unthinkable a decade or even five years ago.Fiscal year 2017 is the first year in many which is seeing a milder increase in excise duties. But the governments compulsion to tax to grow revenues and the anti-tobacco lobbys pressure to curb consumption are unlikely to go away. The proposed goods and services tax is an opportunity. Managing to get cigarettes under it will be a big victory, as it will mean a more certain and level tax regime.Another key task for a new chief will be to assess ITCs diversification bids. The hotels business has proved tough for most Indian firms and ITC is no exception. ITC says paper and paperboards are strategic for the packaging used by its cigarettes division. Segment-wise data for the company is available since FY03. If we look at the increase in profits between then and FY16, cigarettes contributed to 84.4% of that, paper 5.9% and hotels only 0.4%. The consumer goods business contributed 1.7% but thats a different story.ALSO READ: The metamorphosis of ITC under Y.C. Deveshwar

The consumer goods business was Deveshwars master stroke, although a cigarettes-consumer goods combination was first made famous by RJR Nabisco Inc. The consumer goods business contributed to 31.3% of incremental sales in this 13-year period and is now more than half the size of the cigarettes business. ITCs focus was on building scale in the original segments, moving quickly to achieve this, and then identifying new ones.But profitability has played second fiddle to sales growth. In the 13-year period, the consumer goods business has reported slender segment profits in only the past two years. It is still nowhere close to what consumer goods firms earn. The pressure on cigarette sales and profits may have made ITC a bit cautious in recent years. The new chief executive may examine whether a rethink on the growth-profitability mix is needed, including a focus on fewer categories and brands.ALSO READ: The house that Yogi Deveshwar built

He or she no doubt has a tough act to follow. Deveshwars term has seen a good mix of sales and profit growth. Sales grew at a compound annual growth rate of 14.3% while Ebidta (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) increased by 18%. That is better than Hindustan Unilever Ltds (HULs) comparative figures of 11.9% and 14.9%, respectively. Shareholder wealth has risen by 51.8 times since March 1996, compared with HULs 18 times. The initial phase of a new appointees tenure may be to simply do things better. Eventually, the new CEO will need to chart out a course that leaves a lasting imprint on ITCs future, just as Deveshwar did.",2016-06-22,wozwHRIRCXgY9iW5iFWc2H,"The management change at the top comes when ITCs flagship business of cigarettes is facing tough times with rising excise duties and health concerns around tobacco

0.47,"Jindal Steel and Power Ltds (JSPLs) equity investors appear unperturbed by the companys debt getting a default rating, if the share price is a reliable indicator. Then again, its share is down by 65% from a year ago, so maybe the default rating is not news to them.
				   
				Crisil Ltd has rated JSPLs debt, all of Rs.32,638 crore, as default, citing delayed payment of interest on term loans due to weakened liquidity. Falling steel price realizations are affecting margins and this tough period is coinciding with obligations to repay debt. Delays in the companys plans to raise funds by selling assets, transferring certain assets to joint ventures and refinancing debt have not moved ahead.If JSPLs steel business is under pressure, then its power business too is suffering from demand and price volatility in the merchant market and lack of raw material integration, says the Crisil note. In addition to the debt downgrade, a 9 March Economic Times report indicated that lenders of foreign debt worth $500 million (around Rs.3,375 crore) may recall their loans.The problem is indeed a difficult one but it isnt new. All the negative news in this week prompted JSPL to issue a note which mostly reiterates what everyone knows but for a few points. The rating is based on technical grounds, it said, and added that the company had met its obligations till November-December. JSPL said it is confident that once its efforts to restructure debt are complete, it will not be in default. However, what is not stated is when this exercise will be completedthe quarter has barely 20 days to end.JSPL also said that additional steel and power capacity that have been commissioned are stabilizing. Higher output, improving demand and realizations should lead to better cash flows in FY17 than seen in the past four quarters. In the December quarter, its Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) was Rs.550 crore, while its interest cost was Rs.806 crore.Given time, it is reasonable to expect JSPLs business position to improve. The government is keen to ensure that both the power and steel sectors do better and, in turn, ensure that the banking sectors assets dont turn bad. Those measures are working and steel prices have begun to move up. Will this continue even as an increase in domestic steel capacity leads to more supply? A recent report by Morgan Stanley Research states that the worst is over for steel, as China is moving to curb its excess capacity. Even in power, the situation is beginning to look better.The real issues are how much time lenders are willing to give JSPL to get back on track, how long the company will take to work out a comprehensive debt restructuring programme, and how much time it will take for the firm to fulfil its plan to sell stakes in some of its operations. Buyers know its desperate situation and may drive a much tougher bargain than in normal times.A default rating does raise the fear, however remote the possibility, of all these measures not working out, and lenders moving in to take control. JSPLs statement indicates confidence that it will recover in FY17. For the moment, equity investors are giving it the benefit of doubt.",2016-03-11,wq3kUWEgxf4EU3id9jTdSO,"Jindal Steel and Power equity investors appear unperturbed by the companys debt getting a default rating, if the share price is a reliable indicator

-0.49,"London/ Melbourne: Rio Tinto Group moved closer to an exit from thermal coal after the worlds second-biggest miner agreed to sell most of its mines to a company controlled by Chinas Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. for $2.45 billion. Shares in both companies rose on Wednesday.
				   
				The sale, which includes Rios biggest Australian coal operation in the Hunter Valley region, leaves the company with only two producing coal mines in the country that was once the cornerstone of its energy business.It was kind of getting to the point where thermal was irrelevant, theyre an iron ore, copper, aluminum and industrial-minerals business, said Richard Knights, a mining analyst at Liberum Capital Ltd. in London. Now is a fantastic time to offload coal assets.Thermal coal prices surged last year after China introduced mining restrictions. Output by the worlds biggest producer and consumer of the fuel fell 9.4% in 2016, while imports reversed two years of declines to gain 25%, the biggest increase since 2012. Australias Newcastle coal, an Asian thermal benchmark, surged more than 80% in 2016, snapping five years of declines.Rio advanced 3.1% to A$66.76 a share by 1.31pm in Sydney, after closing at the highest since March 2015 on Tuesday. Yanzhou Coal Mining gained 0.7% to HK$5.89, after jumping the most in six weeks on Tuesday.The deal is the first major transaction by Rio under chief executive officer Jean Sebastien Jacques, who took over from Sam Walsh in July. Prior to being made CEO, Jacques headed the copper business. A company restructuring in 2015 led to coal being incorporated into the unit led by him.Payment termsThe sale to Yancoal Australia Ltd. is subject to Australian government approval and includes an initial $1.95 billion cash payment and $500 million in annual installments of $100 million following completion.Yancoal, which is 13% owned by Asian commodity trading giant Noble Group Ltd, said Tuesday the acquisition would make it Australias largest pure-play producer of the commodity. Chinese state-owned Yanzhou Coal owns 78% of the Australian Securities Exchange-listed company.Yancoal Australia jumped as much as 4.2% to 50 Australian cents, while Noble Group gained 0.6% to 17.4 Singapore cents.Yancoal will also make an offer to Mitsubishi Development Pty, which owns a 32.4% stake in the Hunter Valley coal assets, according to the statement Tuesday. Mitsubishi Corp. is considering whether or not to sell its share in the mine, said a spokesman who declined to elaborate and asked not to be identified, citing company policy. The parent added 0.6% to 2,601.5 yen in Tokyo trading.Rio has sold at least $7.7 billion in assets since 2013 as it sought to weather a downturn in commodities sparked by Chinas slowing growth and a glut of raw materials. It has been shedding Australian coal assets since dismantling its energy division in 2015.Other businessesAfter divesting its Mount Pleasant project and completing the sale of a 40% stake in the Bengalla venture to New Hope Corp. last year, the sale of its Coal & Allied Industries Ltd. unit to Yancoal leaves Rio with the Hail Creek and Kestrel mines, both of which are primarily producers of coking coal, used to make steel. The two mines produced a combined 8.1 million metric tons of coking coal and about 3.7 million tons of thermal coal last year.Rios coal business was already dwarfed by output from operations such as iron ore and aluminum, with the unit contributing less than 10% of its $34.8 billion in sales for 2015. Rio will report 2016 earnings on 8 February.The sale wont have a material impact on earnings per share, the miner said.Its retreat from coal comes against a backdrop of investor and regulatory scrutiny on the potential for untapped fossil fuel assets to be left stranded as governments adopt stricter climate change policies. Norways $870 billion sovereign wealth fund, the largest of its type in the world, last year moved to ban investment in companies that base at least 30% of their business on coal or revenue from the fuel.The sale may be a boon for Rio investors in the form of future dividends, Liberums Knights suggested.I dont think theyre going to be hoarding the cash, he said. They are making a tremendous amount of cash at the moment. Theyre likely to pay a dividend at the top end of the guidance and theres clearly scope for a decent sized special dividend. Rio said its shareholders will be required to vote on the transaction because Yancoal is considered a related party due to the fact Aluminum Corp. of China, which is also state-owned, is a 10% shareholder in Rio.

0.06,"Undoubtedly, it was under A.M. Naiks stewardship that Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) earned a pride of place in the Indian equity markets.
				   
				From the time he took over the reins as chairman and managing director in 2003 and until date, L&Ts market capitalization has surged three times to Rs.1.425 trillion. This implies a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25%, which surpasses the 21% CAGR in the MCap index of BSE 100 companies during the period. Not just this. L&Ts stock, which trades at Rs.1,519, is reckoned by analysts, brokers and investors as the best play on the economy.The first major decision in his 13-year old journey at L&Ts helm to sell its cement business to the Aditya Birla group in lieu of the equity stake held by them in the firm, was creditable. For, it marked the end of takeover threats by big industrial groups and established greater employee and public shareholding. It also ended its presence in its only commodity playcement. Importantly, it marked L&Ts transition from a sizeable engineering and cement conglomerate into an indomitable edifice spanning several businesses such as hydrocarbons, heavy engineering, finance and information technology (IT).That said, L&Ts key focus area remains infrastructure, engineering and construction that today comprises about 45% of its revenue, compared with 83% from engineering and construction way back in 2004.Some analysts have been critical of Naiks diversification into unrelated areas such as finance and information technology (IT), though others consider these as cash-accretive businesses that would provide a hedge against economic recession.Proof of this was seen in the companys financial results during the last two years, when profit growth in the infrastructure segment dropped to single digits. Overall profitability got a leg-up from IT and financial services that did well and helped buck an economic slowdown.Again, Naiks decision to enter these businesses can be lauded in that the two recently announced public issues of L&T Infotech Ltd and L&T Technology Services will help unlock shareholder value as the money deployed in these businesses generates good returns.Further, Naik leaves behind a legacy of not just diverse businesses but diverse markets, too. From a pure domestic infrastructure firm a little over a decade ago, L&T is now present in new markets, such as West Asia.

Growth in profit after tax has been even better at 23% CAGR.That said, sustaining fixed costs and overheads in the face of an economic slowdown is challenging.

Economic slowdown and project delays due to tight liquidity conditions among customers has led to a surge in working capital requirements that is one-fourth its net revenue.The change of guard comes with huge challenges, too. Through Naiks tenure, L&T has been unable to churn out profits from some businesses. Its shipbuilding, heavy forgings, hydrocarbons, power and road subsidiaries are either loss-making or have wafer-thin profits.The scene is far from cushy in developmental projects that include roads, ports, bridges and urban infrastructure. For example, the FY16 annual report shows that while its road projects clocked single-digit revenue growth, high interest costs and depreciation translated into losses.The street is also concerned about the Hyderabad Metro project, mired in clearance hurdles and delays. It is likely to bleed once it is fully operational and weigh on L&Ts overall profitability.A Religare Capital Markets report says that decisions of capital misallocations in the recent past may not be addressed in the expected timelines.

-0.52,"The debate on the beaching method of ship breaking could be settled by an application sent to the European Commission (EC) by a handful of Indian ship-recycling yards.
				   
				Five of the 167 ship-recycling yards located on the coast of Alang-Sosiya in Gujarats Bhavnagar district, home to the worlds largest stretch of ship breaking beaches, have applied to the EC to be included in its list of approved facilities where ships flying the flag of a European Union (EU) member state would be sent for dismantling at the end of life. The deadline for submitting applications closed on 30 June.By December, the EC will draw up a list of ship-recycling facilities that have demonstrated compliance with the ship-recycling regulation published by the EU in 2013.The application to the EC comes a few months after these five yardsR L Kalthia Ship Breaking Pvt. Ltd, Priya Blue Industries Pvt. Ltd, Leela Ship Recycling Pvt. Ltd, Shree Ram Group and Shubh Arya Steel Pvt. Ltdwon compliance certificates with a separate global regime that seeks to ensure that redundant ships are disposed of safely and in an environmentally sound manner.This was the first time such recognition has been given to ship breakers in South Asia. It goes a long way in dispelling doubts about the beaching method of breaking ships practised along a 10-km stretch of Alang-Sosiya, often subject to criticism for its lax safety and health rules, says experts.Under the beaching method, ships are first grounded and then dismantled, posing hazards to human beings and environment.The Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships was adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in 2009. It is, however, yet come into force because it has not been ratified by 15 states, representing 40% of world merchant shipping by gross tonnage (capacity) and a maximum annual ship-recycling volume not less than 3% of the combined tonnage of the states, to take effect globally.While the IMO convention does not prohibit the dismantling of old ships by the beaching method, a separate ship-recycling regulation published by the European Union in 2013 seeks to ban the method of dismantling ships practised in Alang-Sosiya.While the first four ship-recycling yards were certified for compliance with IMOs Hong Kong Convention by Japanese ship classification society Class NK, Shubh Arya Steel was certified by the Italian classification society RINA.In order to be included in the European list, compliance by a ship-recycling facility should be certified following a site inspection by an independent verifier.The first four ship recyclers have applied to the EC with documents from IR Class Systems and Solutions Pvt. Ltd, an independent verifier, certifying that they are in compliance with the ship-recycling regulation of the EU.Shubh Arya Steels application was supported by a compliance certificate from RINA.With environmental safety gaining prominence in many aspects of trade and commerce, becoming a green ship-recycling yard has its benefits. It will help them buy old ships for scrapping at lower rates because of the limited number of facilities that are compliant with the IMO and EU rules.The application of the five Indian ship-recyclers could also potentially create a dilemma for the EC.The list of approved recyclers of the EC is likely to include yards in China, Turkey, North America and the EU, but not those in South Asia, though some of them in the region have upgraded facilities to comply with the IMO regulation.Seventeen more yards in Alang-Sosiya have now been appraised and audited by Class Nk and RINA for certification of compliance with the Hong Kong Convention of the IMO.Many believe that ship recycling choice shouldnt be based just on geography and that the market must make a distinction between yards which use beaching and comply with the Hong Kong convention and those that do not.If the European Commission rejects our applications, it has to give a proper justification why they are doing so. If they are that stringent, their rules should not apply to yards in Turkey and China also, an executive with one of the five ship recycling yards said on condition of anonymity.In the run-up to the preparation of the list of approved ship-recycling facilities that have demonstrated compliance with EU rules, the EC is separately discussing a proposal to set up an EU ship-recycling fund, which, if accepted, will compel ships, regardless of flag, to pay for EU ship-recycling licences when calling at EU ports.The money that visiting ships would have to pay into a proposed EU fund, including those flying the flag of non-EU nations, would only be returned at the end of the vessels working life, many years later, when it will probably have a different owner and flag, and only on condition that the ship is recycled at a yard approved by the EC, according to the proposal.This will undermine efforts by the IMO to improve working and environmental conditions in developing nations, where most ship-recycling yards are located and the proposal must be rejected, according to The European Community Shipowners Associations (ECSA) and the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS)which represent over 80% of world shipping tonnage.ECSA and ICS argue the EU should concentrate its efforts on getting EU member-states to ratify the IMO Hong Kong Convention, and to recognize the efforts being made by recycling yards in Asia to gain certification in accordance with IMO standards. They insist these yards should be given a fair chance to be included in the EU list of approved recycling facilities. The outcome of the applications submitted by the five Indian green recyclers could settle the debate.P.

-0.52,"The doubling of the coal cess may end up undermining the revival plan for state power distribution companies (discoms). Thats because the cess will further diminish the competitiveness of coal-based electricity at a time when renewable sources of power are getting cheaper.
				   
				To be sure, thermal tariff is still lower. NTPC Ltds average rate stood at Rs.3.21 per unit in the first nine months of this fiscal year, a good rupee less than the cheapest solar power rates. But when state discoms pass on the additional cess to end-consumers, the tariff would rise by 3-7% or 9-13 paise per unit, estimates Nomura. Now, note that this will be added aggravation for industrial and commercial consumers. This set of consumers is already paying high tariffsas much as three times the average NTPC rate and double the solar rates in some states.As solar gets cheaper and thermal power turns expensive, the viability for moving to their own renewable energy source gets better. The decentralized nature of solar capacityyou can put panels on rooftopsand the governments own push to step up renewable energy are key drivers.As this shift gains momentum, it could spell trouble for state discoms. Industrial and commercial consumers bear the brunt of discom inefficiencies and subsidize agricultural consumers. According to Power Finance Corp. Ltd, industrial and non-domestic customers together consume a little less than 40% of electricity, but generate 55% of SEB (state electricity boards) revenues.Once solar power storage becomes economical, it may see an accelerated adoption. Ind-Ra (India Ratings) believes this may disrupt the operations of the discoms as these industrial consumers are the highest tariff consumers which subsidize the retail tariffs, India Ratings said in a note. Once this cross subsidy decreases as industrial load reduces, the discoms would then opt to increase tariffs for retail consumers, at which point even the retail consumers may switch to rooftop solar power. This over a period of time could become a self-feeding loop.One of the large discom customers, Indian Railways, is already bypassing them by purchasing electricity directly from producers. The flexibility of solar (in terms of installation) can also drive other commercial and industrial consumers down a similar path.Of course, the shift may not happen overnight and all industrial customers cannot afford to build solar capacities.

-0.5,"The next few years will be definitive for the evolution of Indias digital infrastructure and the role it can play in the countrys growth. There is significant unfinished businessIndia is ranked 91st among 139 countries on the Networked Readiness Index 2016, compiled by the World Economic Forum (WEF). Only 15 out of 100 households have access to the Internet, and mobile broadband remains for a privileged few, with only 5.5 subscriptions for every 100 people, according to the WEF. However, India has skipped a generation in telecom technologygoing from no connectivity to over 350 million mobile Internet usersin less than two decades. This needs to be factored in while planning the democratization of digital access in India. 
				   
				The impending growth of digital assets will present India with many unique opportunities to leapfrog its traditional deficit in physical infrastructure. It will help enhance the economic conditions in remote areas, spur new businesses by enabling access for a large number of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), creating a strong digital identity for the country. Above all, digital infrastructure growth can empower the government to embrace and enable innovation, provide resources to help increase agricultural productivity as well as enable improved healthcare access for rural areas, potentially reducing mortality levels. It can also bring financial services to the unbanked rural and underprivileged communities and help fulfil the countrys longstanding goal of education for all. Digital literacy in smaller towns and villages can create employment in sectors such as business process outsourcing (BPO), retail, IT, telecom and financial services. Digital India can also ensure citizens have ubiquitous access to government services. While mobile technology has begun to make a transformative impact, digital access in Internet dark areas, could have a larger socio-economic impact.                                                                                                                              *******While the story of the potential value that Indias digital infrastructure can add, has been told many times, developments in this sector have so far lagged expectations. The governments flagship projectthe National Optical Fibre Network (NOFN)is yet to fulfil its promise for rural India. In this scenario, we continue to trail the worlds major economies in telecom infrastructure maturity and penetration. Network investments by mobile operators are being held back, due to the poor economics driven by low tariffs and a high level of competition. This has hit carriers ability to upgrade consumer services, meet demand in highly populated urban areas and expand networks to provide coverage to rural areas. The next few years could see unprecedented changes in the quantity and quality of digital access. Few would argue against the need for a robust digital infrastructure in India. However, one must realize that the economic barriers to that are very high. The following factors will be key to achieving Indias digital infrastructure dream:Expanding spectrum assets: Few policy changes have a greater impact on infrastructure creation, than optimizing spectrum availability over time by releasing unlicensed spectrum, revising allocations and enabling free sharing and trading. Spectrum is a scarce resource. The ever-increasing projections of mobile traffic growth in India, make a compelling business case for allocating more spectrum for mobile usage. These allocations need to include licensed and unlicensed spectrum bands to accommodate both network coverage and capacity needs. While India has taken a few steps in the right direction such as the department of defence releasing spectrum in the 1,800-2,100 MHz bands, it still needs a better and more comprehensive spectrum policy. India lags behind many developed and emerging markets in per-capita availability of spectrum. Also, the cost of spectrum here is one of the highest in the world. The primary goal for policymakers should be to maximize the use of spectrum, rather than focusing on its short-term value. Also, the more harmonized the spectrum used by mobile operators, the more economically viable the overall solution to improving Internet access. This calls for effective synchronization of Indias spectrum planning, allocation, network design, financing and construction. Also needed is a national policy to enable access densification in areas with low-income but high-growth potential.Creating broadband infrastructure: Let us turn our attention to the resources required for the creation of broadband infrastructure. India currently ranks low in broadband penetration, even among developing countries. Internet access has grown, driven by a higher penetration of mobile handsets and wireless infrastructure in urban and tier I and tier II towns, but  broadband penetration in the larger part of the country is still dismal. Current estimates show that broadband only reaches approximately 600 corridors, largely in and around the top 50-100 Indian cities. On the other hand, the country aspires to create a Digital India with a broadband highway offering a 100-Mbps connectivity to 250,000 gram panchayats. The funds needed to create a national IP backbone and ensure last-mile connectivity have not been supported by a strong underlying business case. The creation of Digital Bharat calls for radical changes to regulatory frameworks, allowing the generation of viable business models for inclusive broadband growth. There is significant public funding involved in making NOFN come true, but private sector operators have so far seen little value in pursuing fiber deployment beyond the top cities. This calls for the creation of robust models of public-private partnership, driven by a combination of rights of way, release of spectrum and creation of a content ecosystem to spur revenue generation via digital infrastructure. Enhancing technology adoption: This is the other side of the story, where industry participants need to get their act together. Over the last few years, new and existing players have made significant investments in transforming the infrastructure for 3G/4G/LTE roll-outs. In a country with relatively low average revenue per user (ARPU), carriers will need to continue focusing on infrastructure build-outs to increase coverage and improve customer service quality. With a large part of the data consumption moving indoors, the industry needs to move towards small cell deployments. White-labelled small cell deployment makes great economic sense for all high-demand concentration centres. Further, developments in software-defined-networking (SDN) and network-function-virtualization (NFV), have the potential to redefine the economies of infrastructure deployment for operators. Virtualization needs to become business-as-usual. This will make infrastructure deployments simpler (commodity hardware with centralized software), more cost effective, agile, reliable (battle-proven commodity hardware) and flexible (digitally defined network topology and functions). These virtualized networks will be at the core of the telecom industrys digital transformation, redefining our infrastructure into a programmable platform for a variety of new services. As an example, business-to-business connectivity business models are already being completely disrupted with software-defined wide area networks.                                                                                                                             *******Ultimately, the economics will work when there is demand for services and development of new use cases. The creation of the content and services stack in remote locations, will be key to drive adoption. There are multiple areas where digital infrastructure can play a big role in creating opportunities. These include public and law enforcement records, health data including patient and insurance records and academic and employment records. Other areas include location services, digital identity including identifiers and demographics, communications and local content. Multiple stakeholders need to come together to create an effective ecosystem of content, services and governance that will increase usage, ultimately creating the business case for a robust public-private investment. But implementation of such initiatives is fraught with constraints related to consumer privacy, ownership of data, data security and protection. Digital India will become a reality only if we can create the data ecosystem required and find solutions to overcome these constraints.Over the next few years, we need to prevent market failures in digital infrastructure creationfailures that are borne out of unfavourable economics and lead to suboptimal development of digital infrastructure and issues in both quantity and quality of digital access. The scale of change required to make this happen is disruptive and unprecedented. For digital infrastructure to take root and flourish in India, all stakeholders will have unique roles to play. For individual business leaders, it will mean overcoming technical, economic and business model-related growth challenges in a transformative way. Ultimately, the combination of public-private funding, progressive government policies and freeing up of spectrum assets will determine whether India is able to fully address the digital divide. The initiative will also hinge upon faster adoption of new, cost-effective technologies by industry players and the creation of compelling business use cases.

				Most analysts were forecasting Ebitda and net profit to drop.

Despite the run-up from February lows, the stock valuations are inexpensive at eight times one-year forward earnings estimates. While low valuations reflect poor investor interest in the sector, two things are clouding the earnings outlook for CESC.One is the lack of sufficient power purchasing agreements for the 600 megawatts (MW) Chandrapur thermal power plant. The second is the continuing loss at the retail business. Both these issues are negatively impacting CESC's consolidated performance.For the year ended 31 March, CESC reported a net profit of Rs.707 crore, slightly higher than a year ago. Of this, CESC was able to retain a profit of Rs.366 crore at the consolidated level, roughly half of what it recorded at the standalone level.The retail venture recorded an operating loss (profit before interest and tax) of Rs.96 crore in 2015-16. The Chandrapur power project is estimated to be seeing a cost under-recovery of around Rs.90 crore on a quarterly basis due to insufficient customers, Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd said in an earnings preview note.Nevertheless, there has been some improvement. Operating loss at the retail business dropped 16% from a year ago. A fuel-supply agreement was signed for the Chandrapur project.

Similarly, even if the Chandrapur plant manages to clinch a power purchasing agreement with the Uttar Pradesh utility, it will still need to find a buyer for 300MW.

The past few weeks have seen the share underperform the BSE FMCG index as well as the broad market. The surprise then, really, would be if it is spared an aggressive hike. In the past one year, the stock is down 26%, while the FMCG sector index is down by 17.2%.
				   
				Excise duties on cigarettes have been hiked in four consecutive budgets, knocking cigarette companies down every time they began to recover from the after-effects of the previous hike. ITC has protected its margins hitherto, passing on the full price hike to customers and reshaping its product mix to sell more premium products. Volume growth has suffered, however, as consumers shifted to cheaper products or if ITC were to be believed, to smuggled cigarettes.A Mint report on 24 February said retail cigarette prices have already gone up anticipating the hike and that stock market analysts are pencilling in an 8-10% hike in duties. That would not be considered a bad thing, especially if the increase were around the 8% level. The fear is if the government takes the duties up by a much higher quantum, say a 15% increase.In ITCs case, cigarette volumes have been hit hard, with an estimated 12% decline in volumes in FY16 as per an Edelweiss research report. Whats worse, its much feted profitability is also under pressure. In the December quarter, the cigarette segments profit margin declined by 1.6 percentage points over a year ago. That is a concern.There are two main triggers to watch for in FY17. A moderate hike in excise duty is likely to be welcomed. The second one is up in the air, really, at this moment. Broad urban consumption trends signals a revival may be in the works. What is common to buying shampoos and cigarettes? Nothing.Some years ago, cigarette consumption was considered to be relatively price-inelastic. Indeed, smokers puffed through price hikes without noticing it. But steep successive duty hikes and the price hikes that followed appear to haveat least temporarilydamaged this inelasticity. Affordability has become an issue. So, if urban incomes turn healthier, affordability should improve, which may in turn influence demand. Price may not be the only reason for declining volumes and maybe the anti-smoking efforts are also succeeding. That is another angle to this story.

				Against hopes of a better asset quality, the lender saw its fresh slippages increase again, the stock of gross non-performing assets (NPAs) double from a year ago and its net profit drop by 34% in the September quarter.Slippages during the quarter were Rs10,341 crore and the tally of slippages for the first six months of this fiscal year is at Rs19,131 crore.Its gross NPA stock got the distinction of crossing the Rs1 trillion-mark in the June quarter and it inched up a little more in the September quarter as well.To be fair, investors should have seen this coming especially after the disappointing results of other corporate lenders such as ICICI Bank Ltd and Axis Bank Ltd. Perhaps there was a thread of doubt that had investors playing safe as the SBI stock has hardly moved over the last two months. But the stock was rightly punished on Friday, with the disappointing results driving down its shares by over 3% to Rs272.90 apiece.But there is more bad news. Out of SBIs Rs19,131 crore loans that slipped during the six months ended September, 40% was from its declared watch list. The management had put out a corporate loan watch list of Rs34,776 crore in March and at that time, analysts were comforted by the quantum given the lenders huge loan book size. But 60% of SBIs slippages have come from outside its watch list. While the list is now down to Rs25,951 crore, it is not sufficient to look at it excluding the larger book. A quarter of the watch list has already slipped, much of it stemming from the weak sectors like construction, roads, and iron and steel. Asset quality of its mid-corporate segment and small and medium enterprises hasnt stabilized for over a year now.Given that SBI would soon be a bigger behemoth after the merger of its associates, a look at the consolidated balance sheet is a must. The picture gets worse as the bad loan ratios of its associates are massive and their combined gross NPA ratio was 13.77% for the quarter and that of SBI was 7.41%.

-0.65,"On a recent afternoon in northern Beijing, Chinese 20-somethings lean over a long blond-wood table in a retail store, examining colourful smartphones and fitness bands. The white walls and spare space recall an Apple Store, but on display is a wider, and more curious, range of products: smart rice-cookers, hoverboards, robot vacuum cleaners, bathroom scales and air purifiers. A tall salesman in a bright blue T-shirt says they are planning to soon cordon off an area to demo Xiaomi drones.
				   
				The brightly lit store is one of 36 locations across Greater China operated by Xiaomi Corp., a Beijing-based smartphone-maker that has been frequently touted as the Apple of China. But Xiaomi has a very different strategy: Instead of meticulously designing products in-house, guided by the technical and aesthetic vision of a Steve Jobs-like figure, Xiaomi is investing in dozens of Chinese hardware start-ups, branding the devices with the Xiaomi label, and selling them in stores and through its website.The gadgets can be operated from a Xiaomi smartphonea classic Internet of Things playand are typically priced near the low range of competing products. The rice cooker costs about $150, more expensive than traditional electronic cookers, but far below top-end products from Philips and Toshiba, which can run to $450. The Mi Band 2 fitness-tracker costs $22, about a fifth the price of Fitbit Alta.The strategy is familiar enough: hook customers on an operating systemMIUI, a heavily customized version of Androidso theyll stay loyal to the brand and keep buying more products. Liu De, who runs Xiaomis new ecosystems products division, says the business will pull in 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) this yearsplitting profits with Xiaomis hardware partnersand double that in 2017. He accepts that this is a very ambitious goal.Xiaomi badly needs a second act. A couple of years ago, the company was Chinas top smartphone seller and for a time the worlds largest unicorn after Uber. But its dominance has proved fleeting because consumers have moved upmarket. They want to get more premium phones and are willing to pay more, says Jessie Ding, a China market analyst at Canalys. However, Xiaomis specs have not changed much over past two years. Meanwhile, competition from domestic phone makers has intensified, knocking Xiaomi into fourth place.The company is trying to claw its way back. Led by vice president of global operations Hugo Barra, Xiaomi is pushing into other developing markets. India is a particular focus because, like China five years ago, most consumers want value for money, says Tarun Pathak, a market analyst at Counterpoint Research. But he says it wont be long before Indians, too, will want better phones. Later this month, Xiaomi will launch a premium smartphone with a screen that curves around the side like a Samsung Edge, according to people familiar with the plan. A smart watch is also expected to debut later this year.If the new phone doesnt jumpstart sales, Xiaomis growth prospects may rest with Liu and his ecosystems division. To date, Liu says his team has invested in more than 60 start-ups, largely founded in the last three years, and remains a minority shareholder in most of them. Xiaomi also offers input on product design and marketing. We target big markets, big demands, he says, explaining that the aim is to maintain a steady pace of innovation so consumers will want to replace or upgrade every few years.Chief among the start-ups is Huami, the fitness band maker, which was founded in 2014 by serial entrepreneur Wang Huang. It has raised money from Sequoia, Morningside Venture and Banyan Capital. Headquartered in Beijing, the company also has a Silicon Valley engineering office and more than 300 employees. In the US, it has launched the pricier Amazfit fitness tracker. It resembles a wristwatch adorned with a jade-pendant-like sensorevoking traditional Chinese jade jewelrywhile tracking steps and calculating calories burned. Huami declined to comment.Most of the products in the Xiaomi ecosystem have a similar modern aesthetic, with simple colours, rounded edges and minimally fussy dials or buttons. Part of the sales strategy involves persuading consumers to buy things they dont know they need.Unveiling the smart rice-cooker this spring in Beijing, Liu De displayed a chart with two coloured lines indicating, respectively, optimal stickiness-sweetness and optimal texture-colour; where they cross, he explained, is perfect rice. Customers using Xiaomis cooker can scan the bar code on rice packages to detect grain variety and other information, and select from literally thousands of combined heating options to cook peak rice. Xiaomis sleek white bathroom scale has an LED dial thats not visible until you step on the scale; it also uploads your weight to a smartphone app, allowing you to track weight gain or loss over time.China is set to embrace a consumption boom over the next 10 to 20 years, we see that crystal clear, Liu says. What Xiaomi aims to do is to feed these surging demands by introducing products with good quality at a relatively cheap price. The companys focus, he adds, is on consumers in Chinas second- and third-tier cities, especially those between ages 17 and 35.Clay Shirky, author of the 2015 book, Little Rice: Smartphones, Xiaomi, and the Chinese Dream, and one of Xiaomis most vocal admirers, is skeptical. Its not clear that theres a business-to-consumer model that works for the so-called Internet of Things, he says. What do you want your fitness band to say to your rice cooker? Why does your television need to be in communication with your Segway? No one has gotten that right, not even Amazon.To date, Huami is the most obviously successful device company in which Xiaomi holds a minority stake. Huamis Mi is the top-selling fitness band in China, according to Canalys, and No. 2 globally after Fitbit. However, Ding says, supply-chain hiccups hurt Mi band shipments earlier this year and it will take time for Xiaomi to get its other start-up partners shipping products reliably. Whats more, theyve yet to deliver many appealing hardware innovations, according to IDC analyst Jean Xiao. She says Xiaomis drone didnt offer any more features that market leader DJIs model. Then DJI lowered its price, so it was actually cheaper than Xiaomi.Dont count Xiaomi out, Liu says. The company isnt aiming to compete on the high-end with DJI or anyone else. Our primary goal remains to serve the growing middle class in China.",2016-10-20,y5bperrzUbKPbFBmEYASZO,"Xiaomi is investing in dozens of Chinese hardware start-ups, branding the devices with the Xiaomi label, and selling them in stores and through its website",competitor,10:34,Xiaomi bets on smart rice cookers

				Provisions and contingencies surged 755% to Rs2,074.94 crore in the July-September quarter from Rs242.70 crore a year earlier. The loss during the second quarter was restricted due to a tax write-back of Rs197.12 crore against tax expenses of Rs189.87 crore a year ago.This is one of the biggest losses reported by an associate bank of the State Bank of India (SBI). In the April-June period, State Bank of Travancore had reported a loss of Rs743 crore due to deteriorating asset quality concerns.The drop in profitability of associate banks might be a result of the impending merger with State Bank of India, which has been approved by all of them. In August, the respective boards of SBI, State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Travancore, State Bank of Hyderabad and Bharatiya Mahila Bank had all approved the mega merger, which will create a large banking conglomerate in India. According to a Mint analysis, this will put SBI in the ranks of the top 50 lenders in the world.The associate banks reported large losses as a direct result of the asset quality review (AQR) conducted by RBI in the October-December period last year, SBI management had stated earlier.Their AQR was very different from ours and this was required in order to align our books, so that when it (merger) happens, there are no surprises.

-0.38,"Cement companies have announced price hikes in some regions in anticipation of good demand after the end of the rainy season. While prices are increased around this time every year, this time around it also has to do with a steep surge in petroleum coke (petcoke) prices.
				   
				In any case, the price hikes are hardly anything to get excited about, especially keeping in mind where valuations of cement stocks are.But first, it must be noted that the recent hikes are on expected lines, and may be enough to only cover increased costs. A recent ICICI Securities Ltd report said petcoke prices have risen by nearly 80% over the past six months, which is likely to impact margins in a seasonally weak period, and the brokerage firm expects it to be passed on to consumers in the medium term. Companies have announced price hikes of Rs10-50/bag across most regions in September 2016 mainly on reversal of price fall during monsoon, the report added.Prices in western, eastern and southern parts of India have seen a rise while prices in central and northern India remain more or less stable, say some analysts. Some experts such as Amey Joshi, associate director at India Ratings and Research Pvt. Ltd, say that prices may increase further in October. At that time, many companies would be looking at replenishing their petcoke stocks at an increased price, and hence would pass on the increase in costs to customers, he says. While a hike in prices to cover the increase in costs is welcome, it is clearly not enough to support the record valuations of cement companies. In a report titled, Testing the upper bands of optimism, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities write, Cement valuations continue to scale new peaks, meaningfully higher than historical bands and despite optimistic earnings assumptions that carry downside risks. Large cement companies have rarely breached the 15X EV/EBITDA on one-year forward estimates over the past decade, and accordingly, we see no scope for multiple re-rating from here. EV is  short for enterprise value while Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.In the near term, the seasonally weak second quarter of fiscal year will end in a few days from now and some analysts have already cautioned about subdued performance from cement companies, especially on the operating margins front due to increase in fuel costs, which could lead to a short-term correction in these stocks.Though some experts maintain that the second half of the year will be better for cement companies, the impact of the aforesaid price rise and whether or not the much-anticipated revival in demand has happened, remains to be seen.The fact that the industrys capacity utilization is currently low at less than 70%, it does leave ample room for volume growth, especially if a strong economic recovery is on the cards. But that cant be taken as a given, especially if capacity additions are higher than expected. Again, current valuations assume strong growth and much more. Kotaks analysts write, The pitfalls of poor earnings predictability may make asset-based valuation a suitable alternative check on valuations. Our analysis of gross block addition for the large cement companies and their individual capex plans, suggest capex of Rs 5.5 bn/mtpa (US$84/ton at spot rate) and transaction multiples of US$115-140/ton, (which is) significantly lower than trading multiples of US$127-304/ton for pan-India companies.",2016-09-19,ylAw4aKIaVgwuFWRkThqFN,"While cement prices are increased around this time every year, this time around it also has to do with a steep surge in petroleum coke (petcoke) prices",competitor,23:28,Cement price hikes on expected lines

				The dynastic business that built a reputation over more than a century for discretion, integrity and fair-dealing has sunk into a public spat of allegations and name-calling. Its directors trade barbs. Its share price is tumbling. And on Friday, executives were jostled in the street while security staff engaged in an unseemly brawl outside Bombay House, the groups revered headquarters.How did it come to this?The drama dissecting Tata Sons, Indias largest industrial group, revolves around Ratan Tata, scion of a family that built an empire so diverse that it writes financial software for Goldman Sachs Group Inc., sells pick-up trucks in Uganda and offers packaged salt to Indian families at Rs.18 a kilo.Two weeks ago, Ratan Tata threw the group into confusion and the public spotlight after the Tata Sons board sacked his successor as chairman, Cyrus Mistry, and wrested back control for the 78-year-old. Neither Tata nor any other board member or major investor has suggested that Mistry financially mismanaged the group. He remains head of many of the affiliate companies, such as Tata Motors and Tata Steel.Instead, Mistrys ouster was the result of growing discontent from Tata, who ran the company for two decades, at what he considered was an undermining of the Tata brand, according to people who have worked with both and asked not to be named because the matter is private.Egos have been bruised, said Harsh Goenka, chairman of RPG Group, another Mumbai-based conglomerate. He said the Tata name stands for humility, humaneness, benevolence, grace and boldness of vision, and it has been dented by the current conflict.Since Mistrys removal as group chairman, Tatas more than two dozen listed companies have lost in excess of $8 billion in market value. Ratan Tata didnt respond to a recent request for an interview.Brand TataTatas adherence to the idea of the brand being a byword for integrity has run throughout his career, according to interviews with more than a dozen people who have worked with him. Banks would routinely do business based on Tatas word, and once he committed to doing something, he would see it through no matter what, said a person with knowledge of some of his deals.When Tata Steel bid for Corus Plc in 2006, it arranged financing with three banks for around $5 billion to $6 billion, said the person, who asked not to be named because the negotiations were private. As the price rose in a bidding war for the European steelmaker, Tata officials found cheaper funding, but would have to pay a break fee with the original banks of about £80 million ($99 million). Some executives tried to negotiate a cheaper release, but when the matter was brought to the attention of Ratan Tata, he insisted the original contract be honoured, the person said.Tatas decision echoes the groups current spat with Japanese telecommunication partner NTT Docomo Inc., which is one of the key battlegrounds in the war of words between Tata and Mistry. Docomo is trying to enforce a London Court of International Arbitration decision ordering Tata Sons to pay $1.17 billion for failing to uphold a contract, signed during Ratan Tatas 21-year period at the helm.A Tata Sons spokesman declined to comment while Mistrys office referred to a 1 November statement on the companys partnership with NTT Docomo.Tata became frustrated at Mistrys seeming reluctance to pay, which reflected on the Tata name, according to people familiar with the case. In an email to the directors after his removal, Mistry said it was the board that has not covered itself with glory, by the way he was dismissed.Family codeBut the Tata family code, rigorously pursued by Ratan Tatas predecessor, the legendary industrialist, aviator and philanthropist J.R.D. Tata, extends far beyond just sticking to your word.J.R.D., whose portrait looked down from the boardroom wall in Bombay House as Mistry was being ousted, made Tata famous for refusing to pay bribes. He founded many of the businesses that are now key units, such as Tata Motors, and funnelled a large chunk of profits to social programs such as Asias first cancer hospital and the Tata Institute for Social Sciences.He handpicked Ratan, the great grandson via his adopted father of group founder Jamsetji Tata, to carry on that family legacy. Trained as an architect at Cornell University, Ratan began on the shop floor in 1962, stoking Tata Steels blast furnaces, before gaining experience in several positions in the group.In 1991, he took over the chairmanship and set about establishing his dominance over group companies, which had become rich and autonomous during J.R.D.s five-decade reign.In the 1990s the Tata Group was ruled by powerful satraps and he very dexterously distanced all of them from their powerful positions and gained total control, said Goenka, chairman of RPG. The one common factor that defines Ratan Tata then and now is that of an astute leader. He eased out Cyrus Mistry from the chairmanship that took India Inc. completely by surprise. If the past was about a loud war cry, the present is about stealth.During his first chairmanship, Tata expanded the company rapidly, often by acquisition, turning a predominately India business into a global group with $103 billion in salesahead of Gazprom and International Business Machines Corp. He also sowed the seeds for many of the groups current troubles, including the purchase of Corus, the venture with Docomo and the ill-fated Nano car project.Since about 2004, with the question of his succession looming, Tata gradually increased his control in the operations of the group, said a person who worked closely with both Mistry and Tata. He took major decisions with less board consultation than previously, the person said.Ratan Tata has always consulted senior executives in all his decisions, including the Corus acquisition, said a Tata official, who asked not to be identified citing company rules.New successorThe eventual choice for a successor was Mistry, the son of one of the biggest shareholders in Tata Sons, his own brother-in-law and a fellow member of the Parsi communitythe isolated followers of Zoroastrianism whose ancestors fled to India from Persia a millennium ago.With Mistry deposed, Tata is back at the helm promising to find a new successor before March. Next month he will be 79.I do not think Ratan Tata has any option other than to hold on to the position that he has taken back, whether he likes it or not, said Kavil Ramachandran, executive director of the Thomas Schmidheiny Centre for Family Enterprise at the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad. In the interest of every stakeholder, he has to take steps to get the situation back on track.While Ratan took the groups products to more than 100 countries, he retained the ethos of his predecessors, that in building a business you are also helping to build India.Nano InspirationThe Nano was inspired by seeing an Indian family riding on a motorbike in the rain. It epitomized Ratan Tatas qualitieshis vision and attention to detail, as well as his stubbornness and reluctance to terminate a key business thats losing money.Tata spent hours with the Nano development team, focusing on getting every detail right for the most anticipated auto release of 2008, said a person who worked on the project. Yet the car was marketed as cheap, a stigma that was reinforced by dealers who had little interest in pushing a low-margin vehicle.When Mistry led the introduction of Tata Motors latest modelthe unfortunately named Zica hatchback, rechristened Tiagohis main concern was how to ensure the car would be profitable, according to the person who worked with both Mistry and Tata, and asked not to be identified as hes not authorized to speak to the media. Mistry talked to staff about what he, and even his children, thought of the marketing campaign and what needed fixing, the employee said.Ratan Tatas vision for the group was a globally diversified and successful conglomerate with some distinctive values, said Rishikesha T. Krishnan, director and professor of strategic management at the Indian Institute of Management Indore. Cyrus Mistry did not dismantle that vision, but he appears to have been particularly concerned about the viability of different businesses.If something went wrong, Tata would tell you to your face and then take immediate steps to rectify the problem, said a senior Tata Sons executive who has known Ratan Tata for more than two decades. He described Tata as a humanist with a deep sense of compassion, who was keen on products that fostered social justice like the Nano, or Tata Salt.In 2012, after grooming Mistry for the top job for a year, Tata stepped down as group chairman, and moved from his relatively modest apartment to a white, three-story house he built on the seafront near the exclusive Colaba neighbourhood of Mumbai, with a private gym and rooftop infinity pool looking out over the Arabian Sea, according to local newspaper reports.Start-up InvestingHe threw his energies into working with entrepreneurs, investing nominal sums in more than three dozen startups ranging from artificial intelligence to online sales of womens lingerie.Those who met him spoke of his imposing presence, graciousness and attention to detail in how ideas would work.Mr Tata. listens intently, has a curiosity to learn and often gives a fresh perspective that hasnt been considered, said Vani Kola, head of venture capital fund Kalaari Capital. He notices the smallest things, he puts people at ease.At the same time, he continued to keep any eye on the Tata Group as head of the powerful family trusts that hold a majority stake in Tata Sons. According to several people who know Tata, he became increasingly frustrated by what was happening to the company that bore his name.On 24 October, before the board meeting in Bombay House, where stray dogs are allowed to roam the corridors, Mistry was told of the decision to remove him.Cyrus Mistry was handpicked by Ratan Tata, said Goenka. This time he will look for someone who understands the Tata culture and the Tata way of doing things, better. Bloomberg",2016-11-08,ylJCy9morUM9QsY5DRkqhN,"Tata group, the dynastic business that built a reputation over more than a century for discretion, integrity and fair-dealing has sunk into a public spat of allegations and name-calling",both,11:24,Ratan Tatas return as interim chairman seen taking toll on Brand Tata 
0.42,"A day after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) released its biannual Financial Stability Report, outlining the significant challenges being faced by Indian banks, 31 of 33 big banks in the US cleared the final round of the Federal Reserves annual stress tests, signifying the resilience of the US financial system.
				   
				Only one of the largest banks of the USMorgan Stanleygot a conditional passing grade and two others, Deutsche Bank AG and Santander Bank NA, both US subsidiaries of European banks, failed. In the previous year too, the duo did not qualify.The stress tests essentially gauge whether the banks in the US with at least $50 billion in assets each have enough capital, management bandwidth and other safeguards to survive a financial crisis. Ahead of the stress tests results on 29 June, the Fed had said that all big banks would be able to make it through a recession. Since the global financial crisis in the aftermath of the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in September 2008, the banks have been directed to create a cushion of large capital against likely losses from a recession or any other developments that shock the market. The 29 June statement has also outlined areas where the Fed expects further improvement next year.The RBI stress test, on the other hand, indicates that risks to the banking sector increased significantly in the second half of 2015-16, driven by deteriorating asset quality and lower profitability. Indeed, the financial system is resilient but it could become vulnerable if the macroeconomic conditions deteriorate sharply.ALSO READ:
 S4A wont solve the bad loans problem

Saddled with bad assets, the banks are expected to remain risk-averse and not lend money to corporations; besides, in the absence of adequate capital, their ability to lend will also be impacted.Simply put, Indian banks are caught in a vicious cycle: They are not willing to lend for fear of adding to bad assets; this dents their interest income and profitability; and that, in turn, further erodes their ability to lend as they are not able to plough back profits to bolster their capital.The credit growth of Indian banks slowed to 8.8% in March 2016 from 9.4% in September 2015; the growth in deposits too declined from 9.9% to 8.1% during this period.The gross non-performing assets (NPAs) as a percentage of advances rose to 7.6% from 5.1% and, overall, the proportion of stressed advances rose to 11.5% from 11.3%. After setting aside money, the net NPAs of banks rose sharply, from 2.8% to 4.6%, between September and March. On every parameter, the state-owned banks are in a far worse shape than their private peers.In March, the top 100 borrowers accounted for almost 28% of credit to all large borrowers and little over 16% of Rs.75.3 trillion bank credit. They also accounted for more than one-fifth of the gross NPAs of the Indian banking system.The RBI stress test suggests that gross NPAs of the banking system may rise to 9.3% by March 2017 under a severe stress scenario. For the state-owned banks, it could be as high as 11%. Higher bad assets will force banks to set aside more money, dent their profitability, and they would need capital infusion to be able to support the demand of loan from the corporate borrowers.Unlike the US Federal Reserve, which identifies the banks that fail the stress tests, the Indian banking regulator does not expose individual banks and rightly so, as this could lead to a run on a bank with a large number of depositors rushing to withdraw money simultaneously, due to concerns about the particular banks solvency. In such a scenario, the money kept by a bank with RBI in the form of cash reserve ratio as well as the government bond holdingwhich could be liquidated to generate cashmay not be enough to cover the deposit withdrawals. RBI prefers to talk in terms of number of banks at risk and not who they are. For instance, stress tests on banks credit concentration risks, it says, is significant for eight banks, accounting for a little over 12% of advances, and they may end up having capital less than what they require.ALSO READ: 
How many banks are swimming naked?

Since 2010 when the first signs of stress were seen, the government has pumped in Rs.67,734 crore capital to keep the public sector banks running. It has agreed to infuse an additional Rs.70,000 crore even as the state-owned banks will have to raise over Rs.1 trillion from the markets to meet their capital requirements. Media reports suggest that the finance ministry has already finalized the plan for the first round of capital infusion of around Rs.10,000 crore. After pumping in Rs.25,000 crore in 21 state-owned banks last fiscal year, the government has committed to offer Rs.25,000 crore capital to these banks in the current year and another Rs.10,000 crore each in 2018 and 2019.For the big US banks and their investors, the annual stress tests are extremely critical as those who pass the grade are entitled to pay dividends and buy back stocks from their shareholders. In the Indian context, such a test still largely remains an academic exercise as the government seems to believe in a perpetual unconditional bailout theory.In the thick of global financial turmoil, the US Treasury announced a Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, of up to $700 billion to save its privately managed banks from the so-called subprime mortgage crisis. Most of this amount has been invested, loaned or paid out by the Treasury and the banks have returned more in the form of interest, dividend and fees. The band-aid approach that India follows will keep the system alive but one cannot expect a turnaround till such time the government accepts that capital infusion is just one of the tools and it needs to do more to revive the weak banks. Meanwhile, wary of corporate credit, now they are chasing retail loans; the trend will continue till they burn their fingers.ALSO READ:

-0.74,"Nandan Nilekani, former chairman of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), says India has a unique edge over other countries when it comes to payment systems in the battle for supremacy in the fintech resolution. Nilekanis observation comes at a time the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is preparing to launch an upgraded version of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), called UPI 2.0, by early next year. Nilekani, who serves as an honorary adviser to NPCI on innovation and public policy and was one of the key brains behind UPI, said that once some of the teething issues with the current version of UPI are sorted out, the system will be ready to take off in a big way, especially in e-commerce. In an interview, he spoke about how UPI was created in the first place, the role played by the likes of NPCI and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its development, and whats next for UPI. Edited excerpts:
How was UPI conceptualized in the first place and how did you go about building it?The foundation of UPI is really the highly successful IMPS (Immediate Payment Service) that NPCI launched five-six years agoaround 2011. This was a remarkable innovation because for the first time it gave you 24x7 instant credit. For example, in a very short period of time, in less than five years, the volume on IMPS has gone to Rs24,000 crore a month and it has become the de facto way of doing remittances in India. Thats the great success story that NPCI created and is really the first product to do instant credit. But it couldnt be used for merchant payments because for that you need instant debit Then some of us got together and were discussing that with the rise of smartphones, there was a need to build on the success of IMPS and to build something which was world-class, could do both credit and debit, smartphone-to-smartphone, etc. Then NPCI appointed me as an honorary adviser on innovation and public policy so that I could share my inputs and entered into an MoU (memorandum of understanding) with iSpirt (software product industry lobby group)... This all happened in late 2014. Then in February 2015, we had the launch of UPI by (RBI) governor (Raghuram) Rajan, who was always a big supporter of the idea. It took them a year to get the software built by RS Software, etc. So it was basically built as a layer on top of IMPS with debit. And then all these great innovations came, like virtual payment address (VPA), push-and-pull payments, etc.all that was the work of the iSpirt and NPCI teams... It took us more than a year to get it done. Then the actual launch happened in April 2016. Then another two-three months to test out everything and get all the banks going. And finally they went live about a month ago.What were some of the triggers behind the creation of UPI?We felt we were in a unique position because there was an organization like NPCI which was a very strong organization on payments, set up by the banks and owned collectively by the banks. And this organization had come into being coincidentally around the same time as UIDAIboth came up in 2009. There has been a very close working relationship between UIDAI and NPCI, which led to the creation of Aadhaar payment bridge, etc. Since it was a bank-owned utility, it was well-geared to offer an interoperable system. RBI was supportive, not just the governor but also the department of payments.How is UPI different from other payment systems in countries like the US and China?In the US and China, its like a walled garden where a couple of key players control the system. For example, in China you have the likes of WeChat and AliPay. With UPI, anyone can build on top of it and innovateits open and inclusive. Its almost like being on a highway without any toll gates.Whats your assessment of where UPI is at right now? What are some of the things that still need to be fixed?This is a mammoth task taking a countrys payments system and make it go into the completely 21st century online real time...across smartphones, fully secure, encrypted, virtual payment addresses, etc. This is a major thingthere are bound to be teething issues. There are some teething issues in onboarding customers and so on, but I think its all par for the course. Itll take a couple of months to settle that down. But as more banks like SBI (State Bank of India) and HDFC (Bank) come online, more and more of Indias banking terms will be on UPI. And then once all these teething issues are sorted out, Im very confident itll take off because it is such a superior value proposition. Both for online and offline merchant payments and both for online B2B (business to business) payments.Whats next for UPI? What should we expect in the next 6-12 months?The idea is that in the next couple of months all the technical issues, all the onboarding issues, all the user interface issues would have been shaken outany concerns that people have. All the banks will be live. All the major merchants should be live. There will be a few hundred thousand customers who will be ready to transact with their VPAs and apps. And there will be choice for consumers to select very attractive apps from a number of banks. Once you have that, you have the ground conditions for take-off. My sense is that the first take-off will happen in the online, e-commerce world. And then the same thing will migrate to the offline world...The big thing to remember is that in the typical card world, you went from offline to online. In the UPI world, were going from online to offline.",2016-10-12,zV5lj7FoBJ2s1KM8orBEKJ,"UIDAIs former boss Nandan Nilekani on the origins of Unified Payments Interface, NPCI and RBIs role in its development, and whats next for UPI",both,03:32,UPI is almost like being on a highway without toll gates: Nandan Nilekani
-0.76,"At one point, packaged consumer goods makers were tipped to benefit immensely from falling prices. That did not happen. Now that inflation is gearing for a comeback, consumer companies (and their investors) may wonder if they can expect a return of good times. The Wholesale Price Index (WPI)-based inflation for April rose by 0.34%, reversing a decline seen for 17 straight months (the decline had tapered in the past six months).
				   
				Why did companies not benefit so much when costs declined? This period also coincided with weakening consumption demand, with urban demand initially affected by poor economic growth and then rural demand getting hit by bad weather and falling rural wage growth.When costs decline in such an environment, larger companies fear they will lose share to smaller ones if they keep prices unchanged. This has happened before. Tough economic conditions unhinge brand loyalty quite easily, as consumers try to make every rupee count. Smaller firms are quick to respond to near-term changes in costs.Since the larger companies feared they could lose share, they passed on lower costs by way of volume discounts or price cuts. They even spent more on advertising and promotion, and even in this difficult environment endured a substantial increase in salaries (blame that on the hiring boom for e-commerce, perhaps).Cutting product prices meant that sales growth in value terms and profit growth tapered. They did report having retained customers and market share. But the pain on the profit front has been a drag on valuations. In the past one year, the S&P BSE FMCG index has been almost unchanged.Therefore, news that deflation may have become history raises the question of whether the adverse situation will neatly reverse. Crude oil prices have come off their lows, which can affect related raw and packaging material costs. Rising vegetable oil and sugar prices can affect packaged food companies. Palm oil prices have been increasing and that could see related costs for soap production rise. Note that inflation is not widespread across categories, and the monsoon rains (if they are as good as predicted) may bring food prices down. But it does seem safe to say that inflation has reversed its declining trend.So, will the larger companies hike prices now? No. Smaller firms will feel the pinch initially and possibly increase prices as their procurement costs rise. The bigger ones will wait and increase prices only when they are confident it will not affect demand. That should see sales growth exceed volume growth and eventually benefit profit growth. How soon this reflects on their performance depends on how consumers respond to a hike in product prices, when it happens.Rising inflation may not be good news for some parts of the economy, for interest rates and even disposable income. Given how the past few years have turned out, packaged consumer goods makers may welcome a bit of support from inflation.",2016-05-16,zXHxVPTlPFVkn08mNMfeUK,"As inflation gears up for a comeback, consumer companies, and their investors, may wonder if they can expect a return of good times

-0.07,"The December quarter is set to be a rough one for road construction firms because of problems related to  demonetisation.
				   
				The fortnight of toll-free days in November forced analysts to cut revenue growth estimates. The government has assured compensation for loss of toll revenue, but that would come with a lag. Worse, it will take care of only costs and the interest to be paid out for that period on the project, but not the profits.Effectively, therefore, firms such as NCC Ltd and IRB Infrastructure Developers Ltd may see revenue contraction because of lower toll collections. Some firms such as PNC Infratech Ltd are stuck with slow-moving orders because of land acquisition delays.Those with a larger mix of engineering, procurement and construction orders may be better off during the quarter than those with exposure to toll revenue.Another big disappointment is the slow pace of tendering by the government.Yes, it was known that the target for 25,000km of roads to be awarded during FY17 was too ambitious. After all, the target was two-and-a-half times that of the year before.With barely three months to go for the fiscal to end, the progress both on tender awards and execution is nothing to write home about.ICRA Ltds data shows the ministry of road transport and highways awarded only 5,688km of roads. A little less than half of this was from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), which was actually expected to award about 15,000km during the year. But the estimates were revised down to less than half by NHAI. In fact, the awards may not even be close to that achieved in FY12. This implies lower-than-anticipated order inflows.And theres more to prove the naysayers right. The pace of project execution until date for FY17 signals the failure in achieving estimates. NHAIs 5.8km/day execution is 17% higher than a year ago, but is just a quarter of the target pencilled in for the year.Subdued progress was noticed even prior to demonetisation. This is partly because the newly-introduced hybrid annuity model was being worked out.Also, not many bidders came forth due to highly leveraged balance sheets. Financial closure of the first few projects took longer than expected.As reality struck the Street, the stocks of these firms fell from their highs. Most of the leading firms have underperformed the benchmark indices and fallen between 5-15% since a year ago.Add to this the credit rating agencies have decided to tighten rating metrics.

-0.24,"New Delhi: One of the biggest expectations with Union Budget 2017 was that the government would divulge details of how much money has come back to the banking system after demonetisation. While the budget has disappointed in terms of giving overall statistics on this count, it does give an idea about the extent of money which has come in deposits of Rs2 lakh and above.
				   
				This is what Arun Jaitley had to say in his budget speech: After the demonetisation, the preliminary analysis of data received in respect of deposits made by people in old currency presents a revealing picture. During the period 8th November to 30th December 2016, deposits between Rs2 lakh and Rs80 lakh were made in about 1.09 crore accounts with an average deposit size of Rs5.03 lakh. Deposits of more than 80 lakh were made in 1.48 lakh accounts with average deposit size of Rs3.31 crores.Union Budget 2017: Key highlights and themesThe total amount which has been deposited under these two categories can be calculated by multiplying the number of accounts with the average deposit figures mentioned by Jaitley. This gives a figure of Rs5.48 lakh crores for deposits worth less than Rs80 lakh and Rs4.89 lakh crore for more than Rs80 lakh. The aggregate deposits under the two categories amount to Rs10.38 lakh crore. This works out to around two-third of the total value of demonetised currency, which was valued at around 15.44 lakh crore. These figures also tell us that around 31% of total value of demonetised currency has come back in individual deposits of Rs80 lakh or more. These figures show that a large chunk of the demonetised currency which has come back into banks is from the super-rich.How much of the deposits reflect unearthed black money?According to Jaitley, there are more than 3 lakh companies which show profits. There are 76 lakh individuals who report annual income greater than Rs5 lakh. Out of this 56 lakh individuals belong to the salaried class, which means that their avenues for tax evasion are extremely limited. The rest 20 lakh individuals include businessmen and professionals.It is possible that several of the high-deposit accounts belong to those who are already in the tax net, and have legitimate reasons for holding on to cash. The finance minister has not said anything about whether these are individual or business accounts. In the latter category, a lot of cash could be classified as cash in hand for business purposes, and it would be difficult to say whether these deposits reflect unearthed black money.However these numbers point to one unequivocal conclusion: most of the super-rich did not flush their cash stocks down the pit. Instead, they have chosen to park their money with banks, fully aware that this might invite scrutiny from taxmen. It is therefore likely that they will have good answers ready if and when the taxmen come to ask questions. There is very little reason to hope that the post-demonetisation data mining exercise will help unearth a significant amount of black money. This should not come as a surprise to those who have taken even a cursory look at the findings of taxmen on black money, who have reported in the past that cash is the least preferred way of holding unaccounted money.",2017-02-01,zhdFUJDvLzNJNFe0puDjbO,"About Rs10.38 lakh crore in demonetised currency was deposited in 2.57 lakh bank accounts, showing that a large chunk of the amount came from the super-rich",both,21:08,Arun Jaitleys budget speech gives clues about demonetisation deposits in banks

If the domestic market sustains this revival in growth, companies can breathe easier in FY17.The NLEM market (New List of Essential Medicines), which is subject to price control, saw a decline of 1% during the quarter.
