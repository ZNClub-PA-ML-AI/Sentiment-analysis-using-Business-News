0.48,"Two sets of findings, related to societal trust levels, in a report released last week at the World Economic Forums annual meeting in Davos, should be a cause of grave concern to all of us. Part of a study released by communications group Edelman, the survey of more than 33,000 people in 28 countries including India, recorded the largest-ever drop of trust in business, government, the media, and non-government organisations (NGOs).
				   
				Corporate chief executive officers (CEOs), whose credibility level dropped in each of the countries surveyed, were aggressively targeted with only 37% of people saying they trusted them.The 12-point drop from the previous year is the all-time low since the survey began in 2001. This isnt the first time the corporate sector has been reminded of declining peoples trust. Last January, Young & Rubicam BrandAsset Valuator revealed that consumers trust in well-known brands continues to fall.ALSO READ | What global CEOs are watching for, according to a PwC surveyStrangely, you would think that CEOs reputation for trust would have taken a hit from the work of the media. But that institution didnt fare too well either with 43% of the respondents expressing trust in the press, down from 48% the year before. So if peoples falling trust in company executives isnt driven by the reports in traditional media, where is the angst coming from? Perhaps theres a third force now that might be responsible for generating the ire and thats the social media, the new watchdog for corporate wrongdoing.Edelman CEO Richard Edelman, speaking at the WE, linked this to the sky-high compensation levels of top CEOs as well as the fact that employees were disappointed their leaders were not helping them deal with automation and the changing business environment. These changes have led to a rash of lay-offs in recent times with companies as diverse as Oracle Corp., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Microsoft Corp. trimming their work forces.ALSO READ | Of founders and CEOsIn India, close on the heels of the controversy last year when several well-funded start-ups rolled back offers made to fresh graduates from engineering schools, comes the news this year of large scale sackings. Just this week, Girnar Software Pvt. Ltd, which runs a series of auto portals including CarDekho and is funded by such heavyweights as CapitalG (formerly Google Capital), Sequoia Capital, Hillhouse Capital and Ratan Tata, announced that it was axing 136 people.Paradoxically, for all the efforts CEOs and top leaders make to build their image, it is the companys rank and file that is viewed by the public as more trustworthy.Indeed, twice as many respondents would have employees rather than CEOs communicate financial earnings and operational performance.Why is trust important? Business analysts have frequently proved that there is a direct correlation between growth and trust.ALSO READ | Optimism reigns in India as CEOs, consumers look beyond ChinaAmerican behavioural economist and psychiatrist Richard L. Peterson and sports consultant Frank Murtha noted in 2008 after the financial crisis: Trust is the oil in the engine of capitalism, without it, the engine seizes up. Confidence is like the gasoline, without it the machine wont move.Part of the reason for the increasing trust deficit is of course the overall culture of lower deference towards authority figures and institutions. But that isnt all of it. In 2016, for instance, Volkswagen AG CEO Martin Winterkorns resigned following the emissions scandal, Fox News CEO Roger Ailes lost his job following a sexual harassment charge, Mylan CEO Heather Bresch became a public enemy when she trebled prices of life-saving injection EpiPen, and Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf came under fire for refusing to take personal responsibility when his bank was caught creating two million fake accounts. Closer home, Vijay Mallya took employees, shareholders and bankers for a right royal ride before flying to the UK as creditors closed in on him.The resulting trust deficit has had several disastrous consequences. Corporate loyalty is fast going the way of the dinosaur. As employees feel free to change jobs at will, this has led to mounting costs of hiring and training besides a struggle to build team spirit and group dynamics. Externally, there is a lower threshold level of tolerance for any slippage in corporate performance. One quarter of declining numbers and stakeholders start demanding changes either in terms of management or worse still, strategy.Corporate trust deficit is a two-way street. It indicates that employees, customers, and company watchers have problems believing what its top executives say. But equally it also indicates that the company itself is in some kind of trouble.Sundeep Khanna is a consulting editor at Mint and oversees the newsrooms corporate coverage.

0.02,"Pune: The 57-year-old boss of Tech Mahindra, C.P. Gurnani, says that Indian technology outsourcing companies have always transformed themselves in the past and that it will be wrong to write off the countrys $150-billion outsourcing industry even as new technologies disrupt the landscape. In an interview in Pune last week, Gurnani shared the bets Tech Mahindra is making and why he remains confident that the company will be able to remain relevant even as technology fundamentally changes the way companies across industries do business. Edited excerpts:
Analysts and commentators have started penning obituaries for the Indian IT outsourcing industry. From your perch, what is the future of Indian IT and Tech Mahindra? It will be wrong to write us off. I see the present as exciting times. Remember, Indian IT has seen changes all throughout its life. It all started with Father Kohli (F.C. Kohli, the first CEO of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd). The model then was that companies said, we have consultants and we will give them to you. Then the Y2K moment happened, which was like an inflection point.  In all these decades, the industry has grown. So, even now, the focus for Tech Mahindra, and I believe other Indian heritage IT firms, is that you need to make sure we remain relevant. Technology is changing industries around us. My priority No. 1 (is) to make ourselves remain relevant.ALSO READ | Tech Mahindra bets on DAVID strategy to fuel growthSo, how are you making Tech Mahindra stay relevant? Can you also share what are, say, the three big bets for Tech Mahindra? I can tell you not three but five. First is cybersecurity. Second is imaging as a service or say, a service where we use automation platform with radiologist, and run imaging as a service. No. 3 is blockchain. No. 4 is that we want to be the largest system integrator in the Internet of things (IoT). No. 5 is network services, as the world moves towards last-mile connectivity, and focus on software-defined networks (increases).All IT firms are talking about these newer tech. When can we see Tech Mahindra beginning to disclose the business it generates from each of these five big bets?We should be able to do this soon. The way we look at it is that we will take 12-16 months to incubate them. So, out of the five, three will go into production phase. It is possible that not all five will go into production phase. And so, I believe that the three which go into production, it is my duty to report the numbers. I have invested shareholder money and I guess it is the right of the shareholders to know what I have done with their money. So, we should be able to report the revenue or business once it goes into production (phase) after 12-16 months.How different will the Tech Mahindra of 2020 be? Currently, 65% of my business comes from IT while balance comes from engineering services, network services, customer experience, platform and security. Im taking a forward call and saying 50% will come from IT and 50% will come from different platforms by 2020. So, obviously there will be changes.Your thoughts on the internal goal of becoming a $10 billion firm by 2020, and what percentage of revenue will be called digital by then? Will it be more than half of your revenue, as against the 15-7% currently? Will it mean significant revenue from M&A?I cannot comment on the Internal  goals. But on your question of digital revenue, I would say that the way market is moving, getting more than 50% you see is not relevant. Because if I get the topline, I promise you, we will have more than 50% (coming from) digital.One of the things which is often held against Indian heritage IT firms is that they are too conservative. You are talking about blockchain. But if you are serious, then why not launch a service line? Take a more aggressive approach like the one adopted by IBM, which has set up business focused on blockchain technologies.I cannot comment on what approach other companies are taking. Im not betting my company on any one technology. If you look at my company, 65% of business which comes from traditional IT will change to 50% by 2020. So, I will still get 50% from IT. So, Im not betting my whole ranch on this. blockchain for all you know will be $200 million practice, say, for us when Im $8 billion or $9 billion. So, are you saying that there is enough in traditional business?I am not saying this. All I am saying is that my companys focus remains and will be in solving business problems. I will choose the technology. Im not getting married to one technology. And that is the difference between service and product companies. Tech Mahindra is perceived to be lagging behind in digital technologies. It does not have a strong consultancy arm, for instance. You are wrong when you say I dont have a strong consultancy arm. I have about 3,000 consultants. I have probably what is the largest IT telecom services firm out of India being a leader for the last 10 years and I will be the leader for the next 10 years. From the positioning point of view, I have taken a position:  I will be largest IT  firm in the media, communication and entertainment industry.

-0.66,"Surprisingly, in less than a month after the March quarter results were announced, stocks of leading hotel chains in the country have bounced back after years of doing nothing much. Shares of Indian Hotels Co. Ltd (IHCL), represented by the Taj brand, lead the pack and are up 25%. Another stock, TajGVK Hotels and Resorts Ltd, is up 18%, while others like EIH Ltd are inching up too.
				   
				The reason for the sudden appetite for hotel stocks is the better-than-expected recovery in the domestic hospitality business. March quarter revenue grew by around 10%, with operating margin expansion beating analysts estimates.Moreover, the clouds of overcapacity in the luxury hotel segment are gradually receding. Prospects for better room tariffs and occupancy rates (ORs) are thus improving. An analysts presentation by IHCL says that while supply of rooms increased by 3.9% during fiscal year 2016 over the previous year, demand grew by 10.5%.Interestingly, demand growth is being fuelled by higher domestic ORs across cities. If this continues, room rates could gradually move up, leading to growth in average revenue per room.And thats not all. Foreign tourist arrivals (FTA) into the country grew by 10% in the first three months of calendar year 2016. This is commendable, given the damp global economic sentiment and after the single-digit growth seen annually since 2009.All these factors promise a rise in revenue in the medium term, very important for luxury hotel chains that have been languishing with excess capacity. Further, the fact that most hotels have deferred or cancelled any expansion plans is good news, as it will help improve balance sheet health of these firms.Some are trying to trim existing debt too. According to ICICI Securities Ltd, IHCLs debt should come down in the coming years, given its strategy to follow an asset-light business model, where it will undertake more contracts. Its plan to divest low-margin yielding assets, like the one in Boston, will improve cash flows and profitability in the long run. This may be the reason why IHCLs stock outperformed its peers in the last one month. Likewise, TajGVKs stock is rallying after it posted a strong recovery in operating margin in the March quarter on the back of better operating leverage and lower raw material cost.That said, some luxury hotel chains like Hotel Leela Venture Ltd are in dire straits with operating loss, debt burgeoning to 18 times the equity and obvious inability to service interest charges on borrowings. Of course, a discerning Street has consistently punished this stock, which after steadily falling is now hardly on the investors radar.",2016-06-24,0SzjCOcC7hwJ0aAKDgzZyL,"In less than a month after the March quarter results were announced, stocks of leading hotel chains in the country have bounced back after years of doing nothing much

-0.69,"Akash Gupta is co-founder and chief technology officer at GreyOrange, a robotics firm founded in 2011 along with his friend and partner Samay Kohli, who is the chief executive officer.  In an interview, Gupta talks about the journey of GreyOrange and its future plans. Edited excerpts:
				   
				Tell us something about your background and how you got interested in robotics.
Samay and I met at BITS Pilani. He is two years my senior and we met during a human robotics project where we were trying to build robots, got interested in human robotics, built the AcYut and took part in a lot of competitions all around the world, represented India in the human robotics competitions. The ROBOlympics (now RoboGames) happens in San Francisco every year so the first time we came sixth, then got the bronze and then finally got the gold. We took part in the midsize humanoid category, which is basically where a human-looking robot, about a metre in height, is involved in a kung fu competition with another robot. These robots are remote-controlled. Then, we gradually started building autonomous humanoid robots to take part in a soccer competition for robots. So we added vision, so that the robots could kick the ball, and take their own autonomous decisions while playing. After this, we got requests for giving workshops/tutorials on humanoid robotics. Humanoid as a project is very expensive as it costs Rs40-45 lakh a year on three robots, so there was no option but to raise funds for the same. For this purpose, we formed a company and called it GreyOrange. We did about 35-40 workshops in 2011 and were enjoying ourselves but soon figured out this was not something we wanted to do in the long-term. So we shifted from doing workshops to doing product development for different companies like C&C Technologies in the US and some South Korean companies. But we were not getting good at anything because the products were from different domains. We realized that we were not building any core competency, so both Samay and I thought that we should try to focus on one particular industry. So we did some research, had some industries in mind for automation like the railways, which is highly non-automated, oil and gas maintenance, and  e-commerce and warehousing. The problem with the first two industries was that they were very slow at that time while e-commerce was developing, so we chose that industry to start  building products. At that point of time we also met Wolfgang Hoeltgen in Germany in one of the science and technology fairs at Hanover, and he really liked our idea and provided us with angel funding. In January 2012, we took our first office in Gurgaon and spent about Rs55 lakh on hardware prototyping and that was a really good decision because it helped our product development capability more than what anything else would have done. We started with two products: the butler system and sortation system, and fast forward to today where we have more than 500 people, three product lines (the butler system, linear sortation and cross-belt sortation), 50-plus installations.Describe your products and how they help automate warehouses?
Linear sortation systems are used to sort shipments. One of the major use case is once your shipments are picked and packed, they need to be sorted according to destinations or locations, because then they need to catch corresponding trucks or flights, so our sortation systems helps you sort that and also capture the volumetric and weight of the packetthis is required for billing for the courier company.Linear sortation system is like a conveyor machine that has arms that help in sorting packages and have different throughput which means the number of packets that can be sorted and weighed in an hour. So the machine can sort from 1,500 packets an hour to about 14,000 an hour. You can also use this system to combine different items in orders. What the butler system does is when an order is placed, then somebody takes a pick-list and picks the ordered objects from different parts of the warehouse, comes back, sorts them, packs them and sends them. The butler makes the picking, putting combining very, very easy. What it does is it completely transforms the paradigm from man going to the goods to goods coming to the man. In the butler system, the people stand at the periphery of the warehousewe call these pick-put stationsand the bots basically bring the racks to them for whatever they need to pick. Bots will then go and store the racks back to their location. So lets say in an apparel industry 120-180 items per day can be picked manually, the butler system can pick 300-600 items in an hourthats the kind of jump we are talking about in the throughput of the warehouse.  The whole process is really dynamic and the order goes directly to our server and the server directs the robots. This has reduced pilferage too, as we have limited the interaction of people to the periphery. What are your future plans and strategy?
There is a lot of innovation you can drive through these products, every six months we are driving new features, improving speed, giving more customization to our clients. There is room for a lot of optimization, efficiency and accuracy, so we are constantly working on that.  We have one major R&D (research and development) office in Gurgaon, but we have service centres across India. We are expanding to South-East Asia. We have an office in Singaporethere is a 14-people team that looks at solutions, marketing, sales. South-East Asia is a big market and since the past 12 months we are going aggressively into it. We have also invested in a company in Japan that is our exclusive partner for distributing our butler systems in there. So we are in process of installing butler systems in Japan. The Middle East is a growing market with Saudi Arabia, so we have set up an office there and we are starting operations there. We also have a small office in Hong Kong and are now looking to expand to Germany. So now our major impetus is expanding overseas and getting a few anchor clients overseas. As regards the products, we are building newer versions every 6-12 months. We invest heavily in R&D as thats the core of our company. We would like to disrupt our products every three years. We also have people working on R&D from outside India, so they can start contributing to the product since we expect to serve a global market so its important to get perspective from different geographies. We are hiring engineers from Germany and the US, so our R& D team is cross-geography. How do you envision your company 10 years down the line?
We are definitely looking to get public and an IPO (initial public offering) is one of the most viable options to take this forward. But not immediately. One thing we are trying to build at the core is a very strong product engine at the back-end, have a team of people who can produce very complex, good quality hardware plus software products, which is the core of the company. If you build a good product engine, then you can pick any industry and disrupt it by building these products. So we are giving thought to things like product life cycle, processes, how we train our engineers and build products that are reliable, have a high life cycle of 7-10 years, are of international quality and are globally acceptable. That is one of the challenges, so we really dont want only to build a butler or sorter but to build a strong product engine so that every three years we take an industry and disrupt it. Thats where we want to reach before we do any IPO.So the next 12-18 months are going to be all about global expansion and reducing our warehousing cost to the lowest possible and adding more products to our portfolio, so that we have a range of products. On the software side, we are building a platform that can run a warehouse end-to-end.",2016-09-26,0W6HaSp2RRPe1CYw3fkxXM,"Akash Gupta, co-founder and chief technology officer at GreyOrange, speaks about the journey of GreyOrange and its future plans

-0.72,"New Delhi: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) missed analysts estimates for both revenue and profit in the fourth fiscal quarter, even as Indias largest software services firms full-year sales rose 6.2% to $17.58 billion.
				   
				The company reported revenue of $4.45 billion in the three months ended 31 March, a 1.5% increase from the preceding quarter and 5.8% from the year-ago period. Net profit totalled $992 million, a 0.8% decline on a sequential basis and an increase of 5.8% from the year-ago period.A Bloomberg survey of 30 analysts had estimated TCS to report quarterly revenue of $4.62 billion and net profit of $1.03 billion in the quarter.Also read: TCS unperturbed by possible changes to H1B visa regimeFY17 was a year of broad-based growth amid economic and political turbulence in our key markets, said Rajesh Gopinathan, who took over as chief executive of TCS in February. We believe we are better placed for the year-ahead, said Gopinathan, who spent much time on the numbers, suggesting that the new CEO will take time to probably replicate the success managed by his predecessor N. Chandrasekaran, the current chairman of Tata Sons Ltd. At the heart of TCSs underperformance is the companys inability to generate more business from its largest customers, banks, in its largest market, the US. TCSs  banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) segment, which accounts for over 40% of its revenue, grew 4.8% from a year earlier in constant currency terms. North America, which brings 54% of its business, reported a 4.3% rise.TCS does not give quarterly or annual forecasts but a few equity analysts are sceptical about the companys prospects. The January-March quarter marks the 10th straight quarter (the company has recorded slow growth since July 2014) in which TCS has either underperformed, or at best managed to keep up with estimates. Looking at this protracted slowdown, I believe TCS has reached a point where unless the company really brings about a change in the way it has done business, it will be tough for the company to ever beat street expectations, said a Mumbai-based analyst at a domestic brokerage, on the condition of anonymity. At best it can match street expectations.TCSs performance mirrors the poor show put up by Infosys Ltd last week, and this is worrying for three reasons.First, both growth and profitability for Indian IT firms is under pressure. Mumbai-based TCS reported a full-year increase of 8.3% in constant currency terms, similar to the full-year growth reported by Bengaluru-based Infosys (with $10.21 billion in revenue) although Infosys reported a higher 7.4% expansion in dollar revenue.Like Infosys, TCSs growth in 2016-17 was slower than in 2015-16: TCSs revenue growth in constant currency terms was 3.6 percentage points slower than the 11.9% increase in 2015-16. TCS added $1.03 billion in incremental revenue in the year ended 31 March 2017, less than $1.09 billion added in new business in 2015-16 when it reported a 7.1% increase and half of the $2.01 billion in new business added in 2014-15. TCSs operating margin in the January-March quarter and for the full year stood at 25.7%. Operating margin narrowed 80 basis points from 26.5% in 2015-16, again similar to Infosys, which too saw its profitability eroded as commoditized outsourcing contracts see intense pricing pressure.Despite falling short of its operating margin forecast of 26-28% in the last financial year, the companys management retained this guidance for the current fiscal year, which at least two analysts say will be impossible to achieve.In this kind of environment, where most companies want more skilled people at client-facing sides, when most countries are adopting a protectionist stance, it looks impossible to keep operating in that band, a Mumbai-based analyst at a foreign brokerage said, requesting anonymity.Second, despite higher growth in digital, which remains a fuzzy word, and the success of new and renew strategy rolled out by CEO Vishal Sikka to revive Infosys, both companies continue to be plagued by anaemic growth. This has made many analysts question if existing traditional contracts are merely getting rebadged as digital. A case in point: TCS claims its digital business grew 29% in the last year and now brings $3 billion in business.Finally, both TCS and Infosys continue to shy away from acquiring technology-focused firms. Infosys has not made a single acquisition in the last 18 months; TCS has looked away from acquiring a company since it partnered with Japans Mitsubishi Group in 2014. This is important because most large technology firms, including Accenture Plc, are looking at acquisitions to bring in new technology and skill sets. Nevertheless, the quarter does have some positives. For starters, the TCS management claimed that its insurance business under Diligenta and Japan has turned the corner, with Gopinathan expressing confidence of growth from these two lagging business units.On Tuesday, TCS shares fell 0.53% to Rs2,308.65 on BSE, while the benchmark Sensex declined 0.32% to 29,319.1 points.

				This will be effective 1 May in five cities including Puducherry and Visakhapatnam, Udaipur, Jamshedpur and Chandigarh as part of a pilot project.

If the prices go up on the 1st or 15th of every month, there would be a rush to uplift products, else, the upliftment would be impacted. This would result in losses for OMCs and we wanted that this price predictability should go away.

Therefore, companies are doing the right thing in testing the model in pilot projects to see how its impact and consumer response.

				In a letter to Wipro employees, Premji urged them to increase their commitment to others and find common ground rather than focussing on conflicts. On the eve of the coming New Year, I must say that the year 2016, seems to have raised questions and obstacles, on the path to a better world, which cannot be ignored. These questions have arisen from developments in the political arena, from the fast unfolding environmental crisis and from forces that want to shape the world into a place of exclusion, conflict and suspicion, he wrote in his letter. He further said: Once we start addressing these issues head on rather than ignoring them, I am confident that we will continue to make progress. Also read: Vishal Sikka tells Infosys employees road ahead not easyYear 2016 saw two major developmentsBritain voting to leave the European Union and Donald Trump winning the US Presidential Election. Both the events have raised concerns for Indian IT firms, that now fear a more protectionist stance could come into these markets that together account for as much as 80% of the sectors export revenues. Premji highlighted four principles that can help people make a difference. We must find common ground, rather than focussing on conflicts. The reality of the world is that there will always be disagreement and differences between people, but finding common ground is the only way of moving forward. This is as true in business as in politics and social issues, and as true in personal as in public life, he said. He added that the importance of Wipros success has become manifold as this enables the possibility of making a difference to some of the most disadvantaged people in the world. About 40% of Wipro is owned by a philanthropic trust that works to improve conditions in Indian villages. Premji said one must have genuine concern for others and respect all human beings equally and this must manifest in action. We must recognise that societies, economies, and the environment are all deeply connected. Individual human beings and people find meaning in this connectedness, not in separation and isolation...So every effort of ours to find solutions and to find meaning, must strengthen this connectedness, he advised the employees. Lastly, he said it is important to have the courage to persevere for what is right and what is good. He said he meets people from all walks of life who are battling the most complex challenges, yet are unyielding in their efforts and positivism. This is what I see across the world, from San Francisco to Tokyo, all places that I go to, I meet people with the same spirit and fire.

-1.0,"Bengaluru: Abidali Neemuchwala completes a year on 1 February as Wipro Ltds chief executive officer (CEO). The former Tata Consultancy Services Ltd veteran, who joined Wipro as chief operating officer (COO) in April 2015, remains confident that by the end of March 2018, Wipro will be able to come back to industry-matching growth.
ALSO READ | Wipro revenue forecast underlines IT industrys challengesOver his 20 months at Wipro, Neemuchwala, who is based in Dallas, has focused on simplifying internal processes, worked on organization alignment to improve execution, embraced hyper automation and adopted an aggressive mergers and acquisitions approach. The measures have helped Wipro marginally improve upon the 3.7% dollar revenue growth recorded in 2015-16, which is  expected to grow at-best 5% in the year ending March. Edited excerpts from an interview:Three full quarters as CEO, and you have embarked on a journey by articulating six broad themes. Given these measures you have started, the management has said in the past that a complete turnaround will take time. Will it be fair to ask if the company can come back or say end March 2018 with industry-matching growth or Nasscom-projected growth numbers? How would you describe this quarter?Operationally, it was a good quarter. Our profitability improved in a quarter where there are furloughs and fewer working days. But I think in revenue growth we could have done more. But core business is doing well. India and Middle East business restructuring (had an impact) and Appirio (acquisition) closing also took time. So these things aside, Im very confident that Wipro is progressing well and I believe three-four quarters is a reasonable time frame (when we will come back to Industry-leading growth). You need all cylinders to be firing for industry-leading growth and that is what Im focusing on. One criticism of your 20-month stint, first as COO and then the 10 months as CEO, is that you have shied away from taking tough decisions when it comes to making or appointing leaders. Analysts believe you have continued with the same set of leaders. One of the things which is part of my nature is that we dont advertise tough decisions. As a CEO, you take tough decisions all the time. About 40% of my current leadership team, from direct reporting structure, is not what I inherited from T.K. Kurien. We have new leadership where ever it is required. (What) Im also very sensitive about is that whenever these changes happen, we do it very respectfully and consciously. So we dont make changes for the heck of making changes. In fact, I feel very good that if you as a journalist dont see this change, then customers also dont see this change. And this is the best thing for us. Remember, we have had a very smooth CEO transition, or rather the smoothest in the industry. Do you think there is a lot of noise on visa regulation in the US and Indian companies dependence on visas is actually coming down?Absolutely. The industry, including Wipro, has learnt to hire globally, many more local employees. Rebadged a lot of employees from our customers. Today I guide my hiring managers that dont make overseas job posting as an attraction. That era is over. So today I tell young talent that if you want to do great digital and path breaking and domain focused work, join Wipro. So dependence on visa has absolutely come down over the last few years. And so it is not that much of a worry because we believe that all business friendly decisions will be taken by the US government. What are say two challenges ahead of you, as you start calendar year 2017?Strategically, we have to future-proof our organization. So execution here will be key. Our exposure to telecoms and energy in the past had its impact. So balancing the whole portfolio takes time. We have to configure our business that we are diversified enough so that cyclical changes do not have more than impact.Now India and Middle East is creating new opportunities. Historically, we have had challenges. So we plan to complete in two quarters. So we hope to complete by Q1 of next financial year.

The move appears to have paid off in terms of profit growth.Gross margins were very good during the quarter. We are at 42% studded ratio and that added to the margin substantially. Another fact is also that in plain gold jewellery our margins were significantly higher thanks to the higher gold prices, senior executives at Titan including CEO (jewellery) C.K.

Responding to queries by members, RBI said the discussion to demonetise old high value currency between the government and the central bank started in January 2016.

-0.19,"The board of Infosys Ltd has inducted director D.N. Prahlad into the nomination and remuneration committee (NRC) that oversees the nomination process and the incentives and pay offered to its senior-most executives, including the chief executive.
				   
				Prahlad, a relative of Infosys founder N.R. Narayana Murthy, will now be one of the five members of the current NRC, according to two executives familiar with the development; the decision may make it more difficult for the management to award higher salaries to its senior executives. Infosyss nomination and remuneration panel is headed by independent director and professor Jeffrey Lehman, and includes three independent directors: Biocon chairman and managing director Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw,  Stanford University provost John Etchemendy and non-executive chairman R. Seshasayee.An Infosys spokesperson declined to comment. The induction of Prahladwhose appointment as independent director in October did not go down well with proxy advisory firmsinto the NRC is significant for two reasons.Firstly, Murthy publicly expressed unhappiness last year with the boards decision to increase CEO Vishal Sikkas compensation to $11 million a year from the earlier $7.08 million. In April, only 23.57% of promoter votes were cast in favour of a resolution reappointing Sikka as managing director and CEO and increasing his compensation by 55% to $11 million a year. With Prahlad, also a former employee of the company, on the NRC, Infosys will find it challenging to further increase Sikkas compensation.Finally, Sikkas revised compensation of $11 million includes $4 million to be paid in cash and $7 million in stock. The $4 million cash component includes a base pay of $1 million and $3 million performance-based pay. The $7 million stock compensation includes $2 million to be paid over the year and $5 million in stock to be based on the companys performance in a year. For the current year, Infosys has already paid Sikka $2 million in stock.The Infosys board has linked Sikkas $11 million compensation to the progress the company makes in becoming a $20 billion firm by March 2021. However, Infosys does not disclose the annual targets based on which Sikka will be awarded the $8 million variable or performance-based pay. For the current year, Infosys expects at-best 7.6% dollar revenue growth, which is lower than last years growth of 9.1%, and with Prahlads induction in the NRC, many believe Sikka will not get the entire component of the variable pay. I dont think the board will now be that bold or brave enough to again increase the CEOs compensation, said a senior Infosys executive on condition on anonymity. Now with Prahlad on the remuneration and nominations committee, Murthy will have some say in how CEO will be paid the variable pay for this year.A proxy advisory firm again flagged concerns about Prahlads appointment, this time on the NRC. First, Infosys should have made this disclosure of this appointment of D.N. Prahlad on the NRC. Second, we continue to believe that Prahlad is not an independent director because of his close proximity and relationship with Narayana Murthy and for these reasons, this decision by the company should be questioned by shareholders, said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of InGovern Research Services.",2017-01-31,3oSFJ7P00Bb3RAgOIOjkMK,"With D.N.

-0.04,"Last month, The Economist published a story on the Tata group with the title Mistrys Elephant, where the magazine compared the conglomerate to a ponderous pachyderm.
				   
				In what now appears to be a remarkably prescient remark, the magazine said, That the revered Mr (Ratan) Tata still chairs the Trusts that bear his name may make it trickier for Mr (Cyrus) Mistry to be his own man.Was Mistrys performance so bad that he had to be removed? The Street seems to think otherwise.One obvious yardstick is the market capitalization of the group. On 1 January 2013, soon after Mistry took charge, the market capitalization of listed companies of the Tata group was Rs4.97 trillion. On Monday, when the decision was announced, the market capitalization stood at Rs8.71 trilliona massive 75% higher in less than four years.The Tata groups increase in market capitalization beats benchmarks such as the Nifty, which has risen 47% and big groups such as Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) with a market capitalization growth of 27% in the same period. Of course, one cannot ignore the market cap of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), one of the groups premium firms that spews  cash, alone is higher than that of RIL. And it does paper over the fact that many of the group companies are not doing so well. But, on key return ratios such as return on equity, the groups leading firms are on par with peers. As far as revenue goes, compounded revenue growth between FY13 and FY16 of TCS, Tata Motors Ltd (led by Jaguar Land Rover Plc) and even Indian Hotels Corp. Ltd have outperformed their peers.ALSO READ | Cyrus Mistry removed as Tata Sons chairman, Ratan Tata returnsYes, there were some bad eggs in the basket. For instance, Tata Steel Ltds acquisition of European steel giant Corus was sinking under its own weight. But its performance has perhaps more to do with the severe cyclical downturn in commodities, with global players bleeding and shutting down plants.Tata Docomo likewise was caught in a long-drawn and bitter legal tussle, the genesis of which predated Mistrys taking charge.If anything, media reports suggest Mistry was trying to put the vast and diversified conglomerate in order. He put Coruss steel assets in the UK on the block and took firm steps to sell off assets of the non-performing businesses of Indian Hotels and Tata Chemicals. There were also reports that he was telling managers to pull up their socks. At the Tata Motors annual general meeting on 9 August, Mistry was reported to have said, I think the journey is going to be long and not for the faint-hearted.ALSO READ | Uneasy lies the Tata crownIn any case, analysts and industry experts say that four years is too short a time period to judge Mistrys performance by or even compare it with that of Ratan Tata, who was at the helm unfettered for three decades. It may also be a trifle unfair to hold Mistry responsible as chairman for the weak performance of some of the companies in his group, considering that he inherited massive problems.Clearly, Mistry was attempting to change the course of the ship, with a sharper focus on shareholder value. Unfortunately, he was not very communicative about his plans.What impact will the announcement have on Tata group shares? It is now up to the board to take immediate steps to restore investor confidence. Unless the uncertainty is resolved soon, Tata group shares may pay a price for the abrupt and opaque decision to replace Mistry and the failure to communicate to investors that the board had cogent reasons for doing so.",2016-10-25,408Zf7yPvqLWnOmSQTyfDL,"Tata group shares may pay a price for abrupt, opaque decision to replace Cyrus Mistry with Ratan Tata as interim chairman",company,07:33,The elephant unseats Cyrus Mistry

Tata Steel said it is still involved in discussions with the German company for a potential joint venture and that the process of selling Tata Steel UKs speciality steels business and its Hartlepool pipe mills are ongoing.Tata Steel UK is deeply engaged with all relevant stakeholders in the UK including the unions, the pension trustees and the pension regulators to find a structural solution and a way forward with regards to the affordability of the legacy pension scheme liabilities.

Narendran, managing director of Tata Steel India and South-East Asia.In March, Tata Steel decided to put its entire UK business on the block in the face of a slump in steel demand and prices, but the plan hit a roadblock due to uncertainty stemming from Britains decision to exit the European Union.The group eventually halted the sale process in July in favour of discussions for a joint venture with strategic players in the steel industry, including Thyssenkrupp.As of 30 September, Tata Steels net debt stood at Rs75,563 crore.Overall numbers were below expectations.

HPCLs operating profit rose 17% year-on-year, while BPCLs operating profit increased at a much slower pace of 3%.GRM is a measure of profitability.Reliance Industries Ltds (RIL) reported premium of $6.5 per barrel over Singapore GRM was the highest in the past eight years, according to the firm, and exceeded Street estimates by a good margin. Most analysts expected RILs GRM to be $9.5-10 per barrel. But RILs GRM came in at $11.5 per barrel. The management indicated $2 per barrel can be attributed to gains from inventory, hedging and risk management. RILs stand-alone revenue fell 19%, reflecting the decline in the broader crude oil prices, while net profit rose about 19%. That was because of a 628 basis points jump in operating profit margin, a 3% decline in depreciation cost and an 18.5% rise in other income. A basis point is 0.01%.Meanwhile, oil producers have had it tough what with oil prices languishing. As expected, net price realization of Oil and Natural Gas Corp.

However, RIL shares have performed well after the announcement of the imminent commercial launch of services by its telecom unit at its annual general meeting in early September.

-0.24,"Amid all manner of disclosures, some quite unsavoury, in the Cyrus Mistry vs. Ratan Tata battle, the one silver lining has been how neither camp has accused the other of personal excesses. So while Mistry has suggested the groups pursuit of a small car for the Indian middle class was no more than a personal fancy of Tata and should be wound up, the accusation never extended to how the man who ran the group for over 20 years went and splurged on a gold plated Rolls Royce for himself. 
				   
				Indeed, till the time Tata Motors Ltd bought Jaguar Land Rover, the group owner would often squeeze himself into one of the more plebian cars the company made.In truth, most of Indias company owners and founders have conservative lifestyles with few of the wild and exotic indulgences that we associate with the billionaire lifestyle across the world. Sample this: in January 2014, the Dallas Safari Club, a hunters rights organization, auctioned off a permit which would allow the holder to travel to Namibia for the chance to kill one of only 5,000 surviving black rhinos. The auction was won by oil heir and Texas hunter Corey Knowlton, who bid $350,000 for that dubious right.It isnt the kind of thing that Tata or Kumar Mangalam Birla or Mukesh Ambani, or a dozen other Indian tycoons are likely to be doing on their summer breaks. Despite their obvious wealth, their sensibilities seem no different from that of many well-brought-up middle-class Indians of an earlier era. That shows even in the way most behave with people around them. Thus, Tata will often hold the elevator door open at Bombay House when he sees an executive rushing towards it and by all accounts Mistry is a chip off the same block.Dilip Shanghvi, founder of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and the countrys richest billionaire by some rankings, is low-key to a fault. Fortis Healthcare Ltd co-founders Malvinder and Shivinder Singh may be in the best-dressed lists of social magazines, but you are unlikely to find Prathap Reddy, founder of Apollo Hospitals or Y.K. Hamied, chairman of Cipla Ltd, displaying any sartorial vanities.Most of them dress simply, wearing suits only for meetings and even those tend to be the kind that will hardly attract attention. Tata, in fact, seems to have dropped his jacket of late, appearing in his shirt sleeves at most of the acrimonious annual general meetings of his group companies over the last few months. Clearly they are not following the example of UK-based billionaire Scott Alexander, dubbed the Vainest Man in Britain, who likes to buy out entire clothes collections, rather than just certain pieces. One year he spent £300,000 on clothes from Dolce & Gabbana.At meetings to discuss strategic plans for his group, Ajay Piramal munches on such frugal fare as khakra while Reliance Industries Ltd chairman Mukesh Ambanis fondness for vada paav is legendary. Contrast their gastronomical conservatism with that of Sean Parker, co-founder of Napster, who is known to have spent $13,000 on a single meal.Indias IT billionaires are of course in a class of their own in terms of frugality. Azim Premji, once Indias richest man, whose stake in Wipro Ltd. is worth nearly $15 billion, would often take an auto rickshaw from the old airport in Bengaluru and once threw a mini fit when he was automatically upgraded from his regular economy class seat on a Kingfisher flight to Delhi.The others, Infosys founders N.R. Narayana Murthy, Nandan Nilekani and the reclusive Shiv Nadar who set up HCL Technologies Ltd, are no different. The latters one indulgence is his Zen garden, on which he showers attentions. How utterly boring, when compared to Australian billionaire Clive Palmer, who got himself a $600 million replica of the Titanic, or another billionaire who recently ordered a diamond and gold encrusted collar for his pet dog.Of course, Indias billionaire class has its honourable exceptions and the latest gizmo or car eventually does find its way to Indian shores.

The business has been renamed Clix Capital. In an interview, Bhasin talks about the gameplan ahead. Edited excerpts:
Whats your view on the current scenario of demonetisation? Will it be beneficial for lenders?Its a real concern for the short term as growth will slow down, borrowing will slow down and payments will slow down. We are fortunate as we are not fully in the game yet. I can see shops being hurt, consumer sales dip, which no one could be prepared for. The next couple of quarters might be really painful. However, it will allow everyone to participate in the economy in the medium and long term and the entire push towards digitization will be very good for us and the economy. Ultimately, it could also drive cultural change against black money and really double and treble the taxpayer base. The overall long-term result could be very positive.If you look around the world, India is one of the most attractive places to do business anywhere in the world, and especially in financial services, the growth prospects are goodas long as we remain disciplined about risk management.You closed the GE Capital India buyout recently. What are the growth plans?We closed the acquisition two months ago. We have assets of $300 million which will be used as a base to expand business. We have identified three major segments for businessconsumer, SME (small and medium enterprise) lending and commercial/corporate lending. Within that, there are multiple segmentsconsumer durables, used car loans, personal loans, education loans, school loansin the consumer space. We may plan housing finance in future. The size of lending could be anywhere between Rs10,000 to Rs50-70 crore depending on the segment. Our firm was renamed as Clix Capital a month ago and all regulatory approvals are in place.What role do you expect to play in the area of technology where you have expertise as the founder of Genpact?We strongly believe that technology platforms, especially those focused on mobile technology, will be a key differentiator for us. We will also add very strong analytical capability, leveraging my prior experience as the founder of Genpact, where we built one of the largest analytics capabilities in India. While there are many fintech companies that are coming up, many struggle because of lack of funding and strong underwriting capabilities. We still have separate worlds between banks and financial services companies, many of whom are carrying legacy systems, and technology companies which are trying to go beyond just their technology platform.At Clix, we want to build the best hybrid financial and technology solution to take our products to customers in a unique manner, which delivers speed, convenience, backed by strong underwriting.Acquisitions are common in the non-banking financial company spaceseveral smaller buyouts took place recently.We will certainly expand business through acquisitionswhether loan portfolios, or smaller NBFCs or aggregating platforms. There are many interesting opportunities and platforms and we would keep looking and evaluating options. Right now, we want to focus most on building our businesses. Our major challenge is hiring talented people. We want to build a fantastic team, taking the best of GE and adding modern-day innovation and creativity and design thinking.What are the challenges for NBFCs in India?NBFCs have grown fast. High-quality companies have grown and opportunities in India are large. We have great success stories. The way wealth has been created, for example, in Kotak Bank, Bajaj, Induslnd and other private banks, is a fantastic story. Having said that, risk management remains a key issue.In future, we will see competition from Amazon, Paytm and many other non-traditional players in this lending space.

-0.55,"Singapore: This weeks putsch at Tata Sons has already served one useful purpose. While its been clear for a while that something wasnt quite right at the $100 billion Indian empire, the chairmans surprise ouster has made it possible to start asking questions about strategy (or lack of it) at a conglomerate that traces its roots to the American civil war.
				   
				Did the newly dumped Cyrus Mistry fail to plant enough saplings of growth? Or did Ratan Tata, who gave Mistry the job only to take it back four years later, not want to face reality? Are some of the businesses he acquired now covered in weeds, compelling Mistry to trim the outgrowth of debt?The answers will be important for investors in the groups publicly traded units, who, at present, have no idea how the coup at the holding company will affect them.Letting Tata vs. Mistry play out in public is a delicious idea. With the Economic Times leaking the contents of an unhappy email purportedly written by Mistry to the Tata Sons board and owners, and at least one of those shareholders giving a TV interview on what they disliked about the Mistry regime, the slugfest has begun. Its time to pour a cup of (Tata-owned) Tetley tea, and settle down.Also Read: Tata Sons dividend payout steady for last decadeV.R. Mehta, a trustee at one of the philanthropic organizations that collectively own roughly two-thirds of Tata Sons, is right to argue that under Mistry, the dividends from group companies have become increasingly reliant on just two businesses  Jaguar Land Rover, one of Ratan Tatas most audacious acquisitions, and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., the software export unit.But to what extent is Mistry responsible? In the letter attributed to him by the Economic Times, the ousted chairman claimed that it was Ratan Tatas 2009 decision to buy a property in suburban Mumbai  in disuse since a 1993 bomb attack  that led to Indian Hotels Co.s entire net worth getting wiped out. The companys last big profit, of $115 million, was in 2008.Then again, a year after Ratan Tata bought Corus Group Plc in 2006, Tata Steel went on to earn an annual profit of almost $3 billion. A China-led global steel glut has turned that profit into a loss of $1 billion over the past four quarters, with Mistry warning in his letter of a potential $10 billion impairment of European steel assets.Tata Steels loss in past 4 quartersMistry cant shift all the blame to his predecessor. While Ratan Tatas non-JLR car investments have mostly flopped, Mistrys problem was not having enough big ideas of his own. He may not have been the one to sink the wireless telecom unit, but he did precious little to revive it. He could also have handled the ugly spat with NTT Docomo Inc., the partner in that business, a lot better.Also Read: Ratan Tata seeks to rally group firms after Cyrus Mistry ousterThe Tata Group has survived two world wars, nationalization of its prized airline by a socialist-minded government and other tribulations. But the damage to the groups reputation for fair dealing is probably Mistrys biggest failing as chairman.That failure has consequences. In Singapore, bond investors are scratching their heads over a dollar-denominated perpetual bond issue by Tata International Ltd. The debt of this thinly capitalized company will derive its value from implicit support by the Tata group. A few years ago, it would have been preposterous to suggest that the Tatas would stake their reputation to save $1.17 billion  the amount the group is seeking to avoid paying in the Docomo dispute. Its worrisome if investors are no longer sure whether the group will even back a $150 million to $200 million bond issue. A no-holds-barred airing of differences between Mistry and Ratan Tata may help reestablish just what it is that shareholders of Tata Sons want their group to stand for. That will be the cherry on the cake from this entertaining spectacle  to be washed down with that Tetley tea, of course.

-0.24,"Public sector enterprises are not known to be investor-savvy. In the last three years, the S&P BSE PSU index, which tracks shares of public sector units (PSUs), gained 18.6%, half of what the benchmark Sensex delivered (38.9%). But one business bucking this trend is the power sector.
				   
				Shares of notable central PSUsPower Grid Corp. of India Ltd, NTPC Ltd, Neyveli Lignite Corp. Ltd, SJVN Ltd and NHPC Ltddelivered double digit returns in the last three years, whereas shareholders of private sector firms Tata Power Co. Ltd and Adani Power Ltd have lost out. The divergence can be partly explained by the return on equity (RoE). The higher the ratio, the better it is for investors. The average RoE of the five PSUs stood at 11% in the past fiscal. A similar calculation of nine private sector firms stood at 4%, data from Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd show.While returns of PSUs have been consistent, private firms returns have been volatile. Three of the five PSUs generated double-digit RoEs in each of the last five years, a feat matched by none of the private firms, except JSW Energy Ltd which delivered double-digit returns in four of the last five years.The reasons are not hard to find. PSU utilities work mostly on the cost-plus modelinvestments, assets are assured of minimum returns. Private firms, on the other hand, took excessive risks, running into business and regulatory hurdles. But this scenario will change. Private firms are seeking better tariffs for underperforming plants and are trying to improve asset utilization. Also, a slowdown in hydro capacity additions and delays in execution means ROEs at SJVN and NHPC can soften or suffer for some time. Within the PSU lot, the underperformance of SJVN, and NHPC to some extent, may be offset by Power Grid and NTPC. Religare Capital Markets Ltd expects Power Grids RoE to improve by about 100 basis points on high capex and capitalization schedule. Similarly, the upcoming capacities are expected to push up NTPCs returns from next year.

0.1,"Seoul: Billionaire Shin Dong-joo has reason to be bitter. In the past couple of years, hes been suspended by his father, fired by his younger brother and indicted on charges of embezzlement by South Korean prosecutors.
				   
				Yet the former No. 2 at Lotte Group says hes confident hell clear his name in court, overthrow his brother as chairman and seize control of a business empire that generates more revenue than Google Inc. or Airbus Group. His plan is to take advantage of the groups complex network of more than 70 cross shareholdings. If he can gain the votes of minority shareholders in one Japanese unit that binds the whole conglomerate together, he says he can effectively control the group.My final target is to take control of Lotte, Shin, 62, said in his office in Seoul in his first interview with foreign media. My brother and the current management destroyed (Lottes) good corporate culture.Shin is attempting to pull off a unique coup in Korean corporate historythe takeover of one of the countrys giant family-run business groups, known as the chaebol. If he succeeds, hell take charge of the nations largest chain of shopping malls, duty-free stores, hotels and amusement parks, one whose overseas assets include Guylian Belgian chocolates and New Yorks Palace Hotel. ALSO READ: Lotte scraps $4.5 billion hotel IPO as probes deepen crisisCoup attemptsIts a big if. His brother Shin Dong-bin, chairman of Lotte Group, outguns him in terms of resources and has already fended off numerous coup attempts. The brothers given names will be used in this article for clarity.No coup has ever succeeded among the chaebol, said Chung Sun-sup, CEO of Chaebul.com, a website that tracks the chaebol. He said Dong-joos best chance would be if his brother was convicted as a result of the investigation this year into corruption at the company. Dong-joo has also been charged but both brothers deny the allegations. Meanwhile, the family feud is hurting Lotte and has added another stain to the embattled reputation of the chaebol groups this year, which have already suffered the bankruptcy of Hanjin Shipping Co., Samsung Electronics Co.s exploding phones and an influence-peddling scandal that cost President Park Geun-hye her job.The battle at Lotte is among the fiercest corporate power struggles in Asia -- rivaling the brawl raging atop Indias Tata Group -- as some of the regions biggest dynasties undergo a once-in-a-generation leadership change.Lotte was founded seven decades ago by Shin Kyuk-ho in Japan, where he had earlier attended Waseda University. He started out selling chewing gum and built a business empire in Japan and Korea. The two brothers grew up together in Japan, with the elder learning to run the Japanese units and the younger taking charge of the Korean part.The trouble began when the ailing patriarch, now 94, fired his eldest son Dong-joo in January 2015 and took away some of his voting rights. Dong-joo says he was removed because the president of Lotte Holdings, Takayuki Tsukuda, falsely told his father that he was responsible for causing losses. Dong-joo said the accusations were part of a plan to wrest control of the company.Fathers forgivenessThe first thing for me to do was to persuade my father about the real situation, Dong-joo said. It took several months to change his mind.He did. In July 2015, the patriarch flew to Tokyo to overturn the dismissal but was thwarted when Dong-bin, Tsukuda and Chief Financial Officer Masamoto Kobayashi refused to meet him, according to a copy of testimony Dong-joo gave to Korean prosecutors earlier this year. The next day, the trio called an emergency board meeting and ousted the groups founder as the head of Lotte Holdings.Lotte Holdings declined to comment on any of the ousted executives allegations and wouldnt make Tsukuda or Kobayashi available for comment.Lotte Group said in a statement to Bloomberg News that Dong-joo was fired because he made unauthorized investments in a software venture that led to about 1 billion yen ($8.7 million) in losses. Lotte Chairman Dong-bin, 61, wasnt available for an interview, the group said.To insist one should be able to reclaim the company just because hes the owners son shows he has an outdated perspective and sees the company as a personal belonging Lotte said. Dong-joo is remorseless and lacks managerial competence, according to the statement.China expansionDong-joo said his brother is the one who is shortsighted. Dong-bin should be blamed for changing Lottes culture to one where managers constantly fear getting fired, he said. He also blamed Dong-bins expansion in China for what he estimated to be 2.4 trillion won ($2.1 billion) in losses for the group.The best players come to China and fight like at the Olympics, Dong-joo said in an interview in the Gran Seoul building, a block away from Lottes headquarters in the South Korean capital. The current management team underestimated the situation. Timeline of events that have roiled Lottes Shin familyLotte couldnt confirm the amount of the China losses. It said that Dong-bin is a proven leader who increased the groups annual sales to about 90 trillion won, from 26 trillion won in 2004, and pushed for the listing of Lotte Shopping Co. to enhance transparency. The chairman has a strategy to enhance group transparency and become a better corporate citizen, it said.As to Dong-joo, his strategy centers around Lotte Holdings Co., the closely held Tokyo-based company that owns about 99% of Hotel Lotte Co., which in turn controls the conglomerates scores of businesses in Korea. He argues that the best way to improve the groups governance issues would be a public share sale of the holding company.Dong-joo commands 33.3% of votes at Lotte Holdings, theoretically giving him a larger say than the 22.3% directly controlled by the Japanese executives. But there is also a 31% block of shares owned by 130 employees that is represented by a single union delegate whos been siding with Dong-bin. Should the delegates vote be broken up, Dong-joo said he could get the majority he needs.Dong-joo declined to specify how hed change the employee voting system, which was set up by his father decades ago, but said there are legal steps that his team is working on. His supporters include Min Euoo-sung, 62, the former Korea Development Bank chairman who placed a failed bid for Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. before its bankruptcy, and Cho Moon-hyun, an attorney at DW Partners.Lotte said the employee union sided with Dong-bin in light of his managerial skills, while Dong-joo should be ashamed of losing the support of the Lotte Holdings staff. Union representatives werent available to comment.Dong-joo says his brother is only a pawn in a battle being controlled by Tsukuda and Kobayashi. As he tells it, the majority of votes at Lotte Holdings are effectively controlled by the Japanese executives as his younger brother only holds 1.6% of the voting rights.They can fire my brother anytime, Dong-joo said. My brothers position is not stable. While the brothers feud rages, Lotte is facing other crises.Corruption indictmentsIn October, South Korean prosecutors indicted five members of the family, including both brothers and their father, after a four-month investigation, accusing the Shin clan of engaging in financial crimes amounting to almost 280 billion won. Dong-joo was also charged with embezzling 39 billion won, which he denies. Lotte Group said most of the allegations against his brother, Dong-bin, involve events during the time their father was running the group. Other family members could not be reached for comment.Separately, Dong-bin had to answer allegations from parliament, along with other chaebol leaders, that Lotte and the other big business groups gave bribes to foundations controlled by Choi Soon-sil, the confidante of impeached Korean President Parkaccusations Dong-bin and Lotte Group deny.The scandals have taken a toll on Lottes businesses. The company scrapped a potential $4.5 billion initial public offering of a hotel unit and withdrew a multi-billion-dollar bid for chemicals-maker Axiall Corp. Prior to its deals freeze, Lotte was the most active Korean conglomerate in terms of mergers and acquisitions over the past six years, according to corporate watchdog CEOScore.For Dong-joo, the crises at Lotte are representative of what he says are managements missteps. He says he has a message for his estranged brother, with whom he hasnt spoken in months. Youd better apologize to my father and come back to Shin family, Dong-joo said. As a family, we should be united. BloombergGrace Huang also contributed to this story.",2016-12-16,644n0DkZZlIjzpFHzGm9bN,"Billionaire Shin Dong-joo says hes confident hell clear his name in court, overthrow his brother as chairman and seize control of Lotte Group that generates more revenue than Google or Airbus ",company,18:58,Inside a banished Korean billionaires plot to overthrow his brother

Most power generators are weighed down by debt, forcing some of them to sell assets.NLC has already signed an agreement to acquire Damodar Valley Corp.s (DVC) 1,200MW Raghunathpur project in West Bengal through a joint venture company (JVC) proposed to be formed with DVC, with an equity shareholding of 74:26 by NLC and DVC. However, the acquisition plans have been hanging fire due to opposition from the West Bengal government.While the Raghunathpur projects has got other clearances, we are still awaiting clearance from the West Bengal government, which has been stuck for six months, Acharya said.DVC, formed on the lines of the Tennessee Valley Authority in the US, is owned by the Union government and the state governments of West Bengal and Jharkhand. Experts believe consolidation is inevitable because power projects are stressed.It is exciting to see power producers evaluating distressed assets and bringing forward their plans for capacity addition if the deal is priced right. It aligns to their competitive advantages like understanding of the region, availability of fuel source and capital, operational excellence and long-term sale of power. It also releases financial stress in the sector, said Sambitosh Mohapatra, partner (energy) at PwC India.While a GMR spokesperson did not respond to queries emailed on Thursday evening, an Ind-Barath spokesperson confirmed the development and in a text message said, Yes, NLC has shortlisted our Odisha plant and discussions are currently ongoing between the parties.NLC India which has an installed power generation capacity of 4,301MW, also plans to set up 4,000MW of solar power projects and is in talks with states in order to draw up viable power purchase agreements for selling electricity to them.We are developing a 630MW solar power plant in Tamil Nadu...We  have a capital expenditure plan of Rs1,24,000 crore (Rs1.24 trillion) to meet our 2025 target. We are also looking at developing lithium ion batteries which is under consideration of our research wing, Acharya said.A host of state-owned firms such as Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd, NTPC Ltd and Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd are chalking out clean energy strategies, encouraged by the opportunities offered by Indias solar power ambitions.

-0.22,"Mumbai: State-owned fuel retailers are planning to approach the government to compensate them for their losses while giving a 0.75% discount for cashless payments, two people aware of the matter said.
				   
				In the wake of demonetisation, the government on 8 December announced a discount of 0.75% for purchase of auto fuel using credit and debit cards and e-wallets at fuel stations run by Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corp.  Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd. The  discount came into effect on 13 December 2016. We may reach out to the government seeking compensation on the revenue losses arising out of the 0.75% discount we are currently providing. We plan to approach the government in a few months, said the first of the two officials cited above, an executive from one of the oil marketing companies, on condition of anonymity. A Mint report last month quoted OMCs as saying that the discounts could dent the revenue by around Rs1,100 crore till March. If the discount period is extended by another  quarter, it would double. The OMCs said they do not want the discount period extended. While marketing business (which includes fuel retailing) forms 18% of volumes for IOCL, at BPCL and HPCL, it forms 40-50%. Religare Institutional Research in a report dated 9 December said, Assuming 70% of transactions at OMC outlets go digital, IOCL, BPCL and HPCL could see a worst-case earnings hit of 8-14% in FY18 if they are unable to pass on these costs (which is unlikely). There are additional benefits of improved transparency and efficiency.The OMCs did not reply to an email sent on Thursday morning.I think the discount helps our marketing strategy. It will bring more customers to us who can experience our services, if they already have not. We will have to see if the government agrees to compensate us for the losses, said the second official, another OMC executive, on condition of anonymity. For OMCs,  diesel forms 70% of sales.  Assuming 70% of all transactions at fuel outlets move to the digital medium, the net discount for petrol/diesel works out to Rs0.3/litre. This can be comfortably passed on, as OMCs have been able to raise gross marketing margins in these products from Rs1 per litre to Rs2.6 per litre over the last three years, added Religare Institutional Research in its report. The OMCs operate (owned and co-owned with dealers) a network of 52,000 retail outlets, with annual sales of 92 billion litres of diesel and 31 billion litres of petrol (FY17E). OMCs said on Thursday that post-demonetisation, they have seen e-transactions go up by 50% in cities and around 30% in semi-rural areas. However, many rural areas are yet to start with digital payments. OMCs said many rural outlets do not have the means to accept digital payments. Once that is facilitated, the number of transactions would go up.Kotak Securities in a report dated 27 December said, IOCL management indicated that it has not received any clarification from the government on compensation for discounts on fuel sales through digital means. However, the company will be able to recover the incidental loss through reduction in transaction costs and modestly higher marketing margins on overall sales, if not compensated adequately. OMCs expect that once people get used to the e-transactions, the discounts would cease.",2017-01-20,6u1ZK0NzOfqJ9BwYwQWWoL,State-owned firms aim to approach government in a few months over the 0.75% discount for cashless payments at fuel outlets,competitor,01:13,Cashless discounts: Fuel retailers may ask govt for compensation

				After more than three years of under-utilization, the company is in the midst of capacity expansion and manufactures for Patanjali Ayurved Ltd, a fast grower in the consumer packaged goods sector where most others are floundering with low single-digit to negative volume growth.We will be utilizing our capacities fully by the end of this financial year which is precisely after three years, three months and 17 days after capacity expansion, Nikhil Nanda, managing director, JHS Svendgaard said in an interview. The overall slowdown in the sector impacted some clients expansion plans, leading to a lag in capacity utilization, Nanda explained.The company plans capital expenditure of Rs30 crore for financial years 2017 and 2018, Nanda said, adding that most of its expansion is coming from launches in the ayurvedic and herbal space, led by companies such as Baba Ramdevs Patanjali Ayurved.Volume growth in the toothpaste category has been muted at about 1.5% in the September quarter as well as year-to-date in 2016, according to an October report by broker Edelweiss Securities Ltd.Additionally, industry leader Colgate lost market share in toothpaste from 57.2% in 2015 to 55.7% in September, most likely to herbal companies who have posted strong growth, the Edelweiss report said. It pointed out that Colgates overall volume growth had come in at 4% for the September quarter. Dabur also saw muted volume growth at 4% in the quarter, whereas volumes at HUL fell 1%.Meanwhile, Patanjalis Dant Kanti crossed Rs450 crore in revenues in fiscal 2016. In calendar year 2015, Patanjali Ayurveds retail value sales market share increased to 5.4% from 4.4% a year-earlier, whereas Colgate-Palmolive, HUL and Dabur India lost their market shares, according to Euromonitor International, a market research firm.To be sure, Colgate has increased advertisement spends and introduced new herbal products such as Cibaca Vedshakti, a toothpaste with clove for sensitive teeth.ALSO READ | Patanjali sparks herbal wave in Indias personal care marketHowever, most other firms have cut back on advertising and promotional spends and even limited new launches.In the September quarter, Dabur India and HUL cut back on advertising and promotional spends.Launches were down in the September quarter in fast-moving consumer goods space space, said Govind Shrikhande, managing director, Shoppers Stop Ltd, which runs the HyperCITY chain.ALSO READ | Inside Baba Ramdevs Patanjali empire",2016-11-15,6vsaO9cru6407Czwk5BCpM,"JHS Svendgaard, a contract manufacturer for toothpaste makers Colgate, Dabur and HUL, expectsd to see full capacity utilization by the end of this fiscal",competitor,02:28,Patanjali Dant Kantis popularity boosts production at JHS Svendgaard

				The latter was a wig, and the former was just bad science fiction packaged by consultants as a $600 billion hair-raiser. But Dewang Mehta, the chief lobbyist for Indias fledgling software services industry, carried off both with aplomb, convincing businesses that at the stroke of midnight of the new millennium, their computer systems would crash because old programs measured years in two digits instead of four. The solution, he persuaded them, was to let a horde of techies from Bangalore and Hyderabad go through each line of code and fix the Y2K bug. That was the birth of Indias massively successful software services industry, which died on Friday after a short battle with newer digital technologies. At the time of its demise, the business was worth $110 billion in annual export revenue.The first hint that the end was near came on Thursday when Tata Consultancy Services, the biggest Indian software vendor by market value, announced a virtual stalling of its business in the September quarter from the previous three months. After Infosys followed up by slashing its full-year revenue guidance for the second time in three months, it was time to turn off the ventilator.Infosys revenue growth pre-LehmanA coroners inquiry unearthed three signs of decay, the first of which shows how Indian companies cheap-talent-fueled growth ran out of breath. In the four quarters before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Infosys saw revenue increase an average 29% in constant-currency terms. Back then, Dublin-based Accentures growth was just half as high. But theres nothing exceptional about Indian companies expansion anymore. All that investors have heard from managements this year is gloomy commentary on how challenging its become to get clients to open their wallets. When the companies do make news nowadays, its more often for dodgy business practices, regulatory slaps on the wrist, and senior-level exits.A slowdown alone wouldnt have stopped the Indian industry if it had been able to embrace smac, or social, mobile, analytics and cloud-based technologies. But the vendors wasted so much time defending their legacy business of writing code for and maintaining purpose-built enterprise applications that they failed to make a mark in the new digital world. As an analysis from  Mint shows, the dominant trio of Tata Consultancy, Infosys and Wipro between them had 1.5 times more workers doing digital stuff last year than Accenture. But the revenue they garnered was 40% less than what the latter chalked up from newer technologies. That makes the typical digital-tech employee of an Indian vendor 25% as efficient as his counterpart at the global consultant. This gap sets the clock back on Indian companies, which have taken years to narrow the productivity differential:Maybe its just banking clients and their inability to pay like they once did. Or perhaps its a combination of weak global growth, Brexit, protectionism and Donald Trumps vacillating stance on US visas for Indian technology workers. Hoping that turbulence is temporary, investors are still paying a hefty premium for future growth. They may get lucky for a while. Still, a dead-cat bounce from delayed orders coming through would hardly count as proof of life.The millennium scare got Indian software a foot in the door at global corporations. But now the shoe is on the other foot. Robotics and artificial intelligence are putting the vendors labour-intensive business at risk of obsolescence. Even if the concern is as puffed up as Y2K, with plenty of growth candidates in the Indian start-up world, at least for some investors it may be time to back new horses rather than flog dead ones.

-0.35,"Bengaluru: Its hard to overstate the importance of the technology industry to India. Over the past three decades, the IT sector has helped drive the countrys economic growth, employed millions and made billionaires out of at least seven founders.
				   
				Now the industry is at risk from US President Donald Trumps policies. The administration is promising a clampdown on the work visas Indias tech services companies use to service American customers. In the days since the US government took first steps toward H1B visa reform, all of Indias high-profile technology tycoons have seen their net worth eroded.Azim Premji, chairman of Wipro Ltd and Indias fifth-richest man, and Shiv Nadar, the sixth-richest person in the country and chairman of HCL Technologies, have seen their shares slide. Narayana Murthy, Nandan Nilekani and three other founders of Infosys Ltd, all among the top 100 of Indias richest billionaires, have taken a hit too. IT stocks have dropped about 3% over that stretch, while the benchmark index has climbed 0.6%.Also read: In Donald Trumps H-1B visa crackdown, Indian students weigh Canada, IrelandWhether these changes are a precursor for more radical measures is what is worrying companies, said DD Mishra, a Pune-based research director at Gartner.Infosys, which reports earnings 13 April, may have the most at stake. The Bengaluru-based company is most vulnerable to US visa reforms because it has the lowest percentage of local hires in the US, Goldman Sachs analysts Sumeet Jain and Saurabh Thadani said in a research note last week. HCL and Wipro also have risks from visa reforms but they hire relatively more Americans, the analysts wrote.Infosys kicks off earnings season for the industry this week, giving investors a chance to get more insight into the challenges and corporate strategies for addressing them. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, the market leader, is scheduled to report results next week.The debate has been over the H1B visa program, which allows companies to bring 85,000 workers into the US from overseas each year. On 31 March, just as companies prepared to file applications for next years allotment, the Trump administration rolled out a series of policy measures making it harder for firms to use the program for computer programmers and announced measures to fight what it called fraud and abuse. In parallel, the Justice Department warned employers applying for visas not to discriminate against US workers. All of this was in line with promises made during Donald Trumps presidential campaign to overhaul the program he described as bringing cheap overseas labour at the cost of American jobs and salaries.From India, those promises look like threats to the economy. Information technology is the largest employer in the private sector, providing a livelihood to nearly 4 million, and contributes about 9% of gross domestic product. Indias software and services exports total about $110 billion, with nearly two thirds of that revenue coming from the US.Visa uncertainty could wreak havoc with planning and jeopardize profits in the industry. It may also raise risks for customers that depend on such services, from Wall Street banks to retailers and airlines. Difficulties in getting visas or rising salaries of H-1B employees will have a material impact on companies, said Rostow Ravanan, chief executive officer of Mindtree Ltd, a Bangalore-based outsourcer that uses hundreds of H-1B visas every year.Several countries around the world are adopting or considering similar policies. That poses a threat to the business model perfected by Indian companies, Ravanan said. These trends are dangerous because the IT industry and its talent serve the entire world, he said.Leading outsourcers including Infosys, Tata Consultancy, Wipro and HCL Technologies declined to comment on the visa issue.Companies have been working on contingency plans. If foreign workers cannot go to the US, it will become more expensive to hire local staff. Companies may also try to do more work for American clients from abroad, including India.Nitin Rakesh, chief executive officer of tech services provider Mphasis Ltd is optimistic. He said the industry has gone through four or five reincarnations since the outsourcing business began. A Trump crackdown may lead to more innovation in the model.Through leveraging all the possible technology, including mobility and cloud, the growth opportunities are immense, said Rakesh, warning however that some companies will adapt and others may not. Growth will not be homogeneous. Bloomberg",2017-04-12,77F9x3usi1EEO6LQqHtsWM,"US President Donald Trumps H1B visa reform policies have eroded the net worth of Indias high-profile technology tycoons, including Azim Premji ",both,08:08,"H1B visa reform hits tech billionaires, from Azim Premji to Shiv Nadar"

				The Times of India said on Monday that Tech Mahindra Ltd is leading the race and is contemplating an offer that is at a 20% premium to the recent market price of Mphasis.Its true that a 20% premium to the current market price will be an aggressive offer. But its a bit premature for minority shareholders of Mphasis to get excited. This is because any decent offer will be possible only if HP sweetens the deal for the acquirer.As things stand, about a fourth of the companys revenue comes via HP, and it is declining at a fast pace. In the December quarter, revenue from the HP channel fell by almost 12% quarter-on-quarter. Five years ago, this business had an annual revenue run rate of $700 million; it has now fallen to around $220 million, based on the December quarter revenue. At this rate, the business will soon disappear. It doesnt make sense for any acquirer to pay a premium, unless HP provides some surety for providing business to Mphasis for at least three-five years. This may well be in HPs interest as well, as a decent- enough premium will help HP garner nearly $1 billion from the sale. But, of course, this cant be taken for granted. HP also has a wholly-owned subsidiary in India, which appears to have been a larger beneficiary of its offshoring efforts in recent years. As far as Tech Mahindras interest in the company goes, Mphasis, with its large exposure to the banking and financial services sector, will be a good fit. This is a segment where Tech Mahindra has lagged behind peers, and the acquisition will increase its scale in the business to a respectable $1 billion.But having said that, the risk of paying too much and merger integration issues are areas of concern. Analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd say in an 8 February note, One of the key things a buyer would look at when considering MPHL is the margin that it makes in the Direct Channel versus HP channel... Based on our calculation, direct channel Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margins could be around 11% (nearly half of the HP Channel Ebit margins of around 20%).In most of the recent deals in the IT (information technology) services space, the target companies have had margins of around 20% and their portfolios have been far more diversified. As such, theres hardly any reason for paying a high premium for Mphasis over comparable deals such as iGate Corp.s acquisition of Patni Computer Systems Ltd.It seems the only way HP can extract good value is to commit to certain revenues via the HP channel for the next few years.

				But while Infosys Ltd and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) have presented contrasting images of each other at times, together the two big Indian software exporters have held a mirror. Analysts have used them to view global spending on those invisible lines of computer code that enable large corporations to run themselves. No longer. The picture the duo are displaying now is more about how their own industry is at risk of being overrun by robots.Infosys operating margin 
Before last quarters results, Infosys was doing a relatively better job of gaining investor approval. This time last year, TCS shares enjoyed a 15% higher valuation than Infosys, based on analysts expectations of future earnings. By this week, that had turned into a small discount.Then on Thursday, TCS beat revenue and profit estimates for the June quarter, but operating margins shrank to 25%. Thats below the managements targeted range of 26% to 28%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Infosys, which reported on Friday, cut its sales forecast for the year. Worse still, its operating margin came in at just 24.1%, extending a nearly four-year decline in relative profitability for the Bangalore-based group.Two years ago, Infosys tapped SAP executive Vishal Sikka to take over from the founders, who all seemed bent on having a go at running the company before retirement. For a while, it looked like they might run it aground. But while Infosys has steadied under Sikka, its increasingly clear that the new normal for operating margins for both Infosys and TCS may be around 25%, and not the 29% to 31% that at least Infosys used to hit fairly regularly before its management merry-go-around left it dizzy.Profitability is now capped by robots, or, to be more specific, a combination of artificial intelligence, digital technologies, blockchain and other innovations that are challenging the traditional strategy of throwing people at complex software problems and charging clients for their time. But while the large Indian vendors are themselves investing in these new areas, so much of their legacy business depends on exploiting the price difference between techies in the West and in developing countries, its not clear if theyll be able to switch to a people-lite business model in time.For the top four Indian vendors, growth in total employment has slowed to 8% levels, from 106% in the year ended in March 2012. But nimbler challengers are threatening to nibble at juicy businesses faster than the Indian companies can slim down. For instance, UK-based start-up Thought Machine has created a new, blockchain-based core banking package that resides in the cloud and wont require expensive in-house data centers, according to a report this week in Artificial Intelligence Online. TCS has made two acquisitions of more than $500 million in value, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. The last was in 2014. Infosys hasnt done any of that size with its $5 billion in cash. TCS fell as much as 3.8% in Mumbai on Friday, while Infosys slumped almost 11%. The relative performance of the two is no longer much of an investment theme. Of far greater importance is how they take on those robots. Bloomberg

The UK-based firm, as also Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd, was given approval by the oil ministry to retail petrol and diesel, officials said. A significant step in #BPs partnership with Indiabeen granted licence to market Motor Spirit and High Speed Diesel, it said.

Subsequently, it got full approval for that. We can confirm we have been granted approval for marketing for ATF, the BP spokesperson said. For a licence to retail auto fuelspetrol, diesel and ATF, a company should have invested a minimum of Rs2,000 crore in exploration or production of oil and gas, oil refining, gas or product pipeline or terminals leading to additionally to the existing assets or creation of new assets in the eligible activities. BP, which had in 2011 bought 30% interest in 21 exploration blocks of Reliance Industries for $7.2 billion, had cited investment of nearly $500 million in oil and gas exploration and production for gaining the licence.

				Farming had left his family in debt, so his parents moved to Delhi from a village near Khajuraho in Madhya Pradesh in 1986, in the hope of making money. They started working as labourers for a construction site which was to become a part of the American Embassy School (in south  Delhis Chanakyapuri area), says Das, who was born in Delhi. Five years later, his father died of a brain tumour. It must have happened because of the weight he used to carry on his head every day, believes Das. The tumour was diagnosed at the last stage; even if it was detected earlier, we couldnt have done anything. Ma and pa used to earn Rs10 each a day, which was never enough to feed a family of five, says Das, who has two siblings. From then on, his mother was the sole earner. Das must have been three years old when his mother put him in a crèche, organized at the construction site by Mobile Creches, a Delhi-based non-profit that offers day care and education programmes for children of construction workers. Initially, I wasnt too keen but my mother insisted. Our house (in Sanjay Niwas slum) was 5 minutes away from the site, so I used to go to the crèche every day, along with my sister and brother at 2pm, study, eat and play games, recalls Das whose favourite part of the day was eating bananas offered at the crèche with the other 10 children. He continued going to the crèche even after joining a nearby government-run school at the age of 5. Our mother was very particular about education. She would work extra hours to ensure that we went to school, he says. Till the age of 10, Das used to spend his mornings at the crèche and the afternoons at the school.Mobile Creches helped too, with its scholarship scheme. Till sixth standard they offered Rs900 if we passed a year, from Class VI-X, it was Rs1,200 for passing each class, and Rs1,500 for the last two years, says Das. Each year, Das secured the scholarship, which helped him in his education and paid some expenses at home too. The crèche was removed after the completion of the construction. But another learning opportunity arose: as part of an initiative by the American Embassy School, children living in the slums were offered the chance to spend every Thursday with the children inside the school. He made the most of these visits. It was by interacting with those students and teachers that I learnt English, says Das, who used to spend most of his Thursdays in the computer activity room.He also started working at a dhaba, which fetched him Rs50 and two meals a day. My summer holidays were also spent working as a cleaner and waiter there. Those Thursdays continued till Das completed his Class XII. By then, he had decided to pursue a career in computers. Aware of his ambitions, one of the teachers at the American Embassy School helped Das secure admission in a computer learning centre at South Extension. After completing a one-year diploma in hardware, Das started working with Mobile Creches as part of its technical support team. While working there for three years, he did a six-month course in Linux as well as completed his bachelors in arts through correspondence from Delhi University. Those three years taught me lot about what I wanted to do with my life. Things at home also improved; my mother was no longer a daily wager (she had a fixed job as a construction worker with a company and earned Rs1,500 a month), says Das, who earned Rs7,000 a month at Mobile Creches. Das then applied to a few multinational firms through a job portal. After six months he got a job and is currently a senior engineer at IBM in Noida. Had I refused to go to that makeshift crèche that day, my life wouldnt have been the same, he says. Like Das, Mobile Creches has helped shape many a childs life. Within each centre, there are three separate classrooms: a creche, for children birth to 3 years; the balwadi, for the 3 to 5 year olds; and NFE (bridge-course section), for children 6 and older. The approach is promotive in the sense that it takes care of the age-appropriate developmental needs of the children across the three sections  Creche (0-3), Balwadi (3-6) and Non-Formal Education (NFE) (6+). Mobile Creches emphasizes early stimulation, culturally appropriate learning and the acquisition of psycho-social skills in children. A specially designed curricula for each age group helps in early learning aiming at holistic development of the child.Mobile Creches 8-hour programme, six days a week, for birth to 12 year olds provides an integrated package of age-appropriate health, nutritional and educational interventions. The non-profit, which provides services to more than 3,000 children a day across the country with the help of volunteers, has adopted a nutrition programme to tackle malnutrition.With the focus on under-threes, this programme has a provision of fresh, wholesome food and a balanced mix of nutrients. Children are fed three times a daymilk is provided to them and fruits, vegetables, eggs, cereals and pulses constitute the daily diet, to ensure a minimum of 500 calories for each child as nutrition supplementation. A special diet is given to all children with weights below normal. The under-3 under-weight children are frequently fed and given a high protein ready-to-use-therapeutic-food made by Mobile Creches staff at every centre, explains Mridula Bajaj, executive director of Mobile Creches, whose sponsors include KPMG, DLF Foundation, Roselle, Oracle, Plan, Unitech and PNB Housing Finance.Talking about the importance of donations, Bajaj says, Of course, every drop counts and every single contribution, big or small, helps in the development of these children.

0.9,"Ousted Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry was pushing C. Sivasankaran, who had played dealmaker in several Tata group transactions in the past, to pay up the Siva groups share of the DoCoMo award, and also discussed with the board of the holding company possible legal action against the sometimes controversial, Seychelles-based entrepreneur, documents seen by Mint show.
				   
				On 15 September, at his penultimate Tata Sons board meeting as chairman, Mistry raised this issue, the documents show. He was removed as chairman when the board next met on 24 October.Interestingly, on 19 September, Tata Sons (Tata Teleservices Ltd and NTT DoCoMo Inc. are named as co-respondents) received a legal notice from a firm retained by Sivasankarans Sterling Info-tech Ltd, alleging mismanagement of Tata Teleservices and reserving the right to seek damages to recover its (Sterlings) losses.Mint learns that a decision on how to respond to this email had not been taken till Mistrys exit.Tata group spokesperson Debasis Ray said in an email response to Mints queries that in 2008, when Docomo agreed to acquire shares of Tata Teleservices, Tata Sons voluntarily offered other shareholders of TTSL an opportunity for a pro-rata sale of their holdings. This was subject to the shareholders agreeing to bear a pro-rata portion of any claims or amounts payable to Docomo should such an event arise.... Thereafter in 2014, Docomo exercised the put option. In terms of the agreement with the selling shareholders, Tata Sons demanded from Mr Sivasankaran his pro-rata share of the amount payable to Docomo.Ray added that Tata Sons is pursuing all legal options for recovery of this amount.Mint couldnt ascertain whether the company had responded to Sivasankarans notice. Sivasankaran could not be reached for comment immediately.The notice from Sivasankarans law firm mentions his long-standing association with the Tata Group of Companies on account of his close association with Mr Ratan Tata.Sivasankaran has had several dealings with the group, taking Barista, Indias first coffee chain that the Tata group had acquired, off its hands, selling Dishnet DSL to the Tata-owned VSNL, which subsequently became Tata Communications, and facilitating the sale of the Tata stake in the Birla-Tata-AT&T telecom venture to the Aditya Birla Group, resulting in the formation of Idea Cellular Ltd.In early 2006, the Siva group acquired 520 million shares in Tata Teleservices at Rs 17 per share or Rs884 crore. It paid Rs102 crore towards this, the documents show. It paid the balance in February 2006. Of the Rs782 crore, the documents show that Rs650 crore was funded by a loan from Standard Chartered Bank effectively guaranteed by Tata Sons. The balance Rs132 crore came from Kalimati Investments, a subsidiary of Tata Steel.Ray confirmed both and said that to ensure that in the event of a default on the repayment of the loan, the shares of Tata Teleservices were not sold to a third party, Tata Sons agreed to an arrangement whereby the bank would sell the shares to Tata Sons.He added that a part of the consideration was funded by another Tata company for a few days on market-linked terms.In 2006, when the loan was refunded, the Tata group withdrew this guarantee, and the Siva group had to provided other collateral to the bank, the documents show.Then came the 2008 deal with DoCoMo under which the latter bought shares amounting to 26% of Tata Teleservices equity. Of the 26%, 20% was to be fresh equity and 6%, a sale by existing shareholders. Under this, the documents with Mint show, Sivasankaran sold 20.74 million shares at Rs117.81 apiece, turning a tidy profit.The DoCoMo investment eventually turned sour, and with no initial public offering in sight, the Japanese company exercised a put option. The resulting litigation led to an award of Rs8,450 crore to DoCoMo. Of this, the Siva groups share was Rs694 crore.The September legal notice from the Siva group and a letter to Mistry in October 2013 from Sivasankaran refer to Tata Teleservicess dire need for equity, and present the Siva groups investment in the company as a sort of lifeline.This representation was disputed by Mistry in his response to the letter. I have been advised by Mr (Ratan) Tata that the investment made by the Siva Group was made principally on the consideration that the telecom sector was fast-growing and represented a good investment opportunity. In his letter, Sivasankaran referred to an earlier letter to Ratan Tata in 2011 seeking assistance in finding a buyer for the Siva groups holding in Tata Teleservices.He further asks Mistry for a fair resolution (presumably a buyback of his holdings) in line with the mutually benevolent relation between the Tata group and Siva group which made the Siva group walk the extra miles to support the Tata group by undertaking risks which no financial investor acting in self-interest would.From Rays comments, it looks like that resolution is headed for the courts.",2016-11-09,8UuRA0q7zaqX07hXw3QxPL,"At his penultimate Tata Sons board meeting as chairman, Cyrus Mistry raised the issue, the documents show",company,01:31,Cyrus Mistry was trying to get Siva group to pay share of DoCoMo award

				Right now, H1B visas are being awarded in a totally random lottery. And thats wrong, Trump told workers in Wisconsin, announcing a reform of the visa category. Instead, they should be given to the most skilled and highest paid applicants.Whatever your views on Trump, he is factually correct on that last point. H1Bs are supposed to go to those working in an occupation that requires theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge.Its hard to make a case that the jobs being filled by the Indian IT outsourcing firms that dominate H1B visa issuancesuch as Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys Ltd, which Sikka and Gopinathan helmmake use of highly specialized knowledge when they regularly pay less than other firms like Apple Inc. or Google parent Alphabet Inc.On the first point, Trumps a little off, though, because the awarding of H1Bs isnt a totally random lottery: A 2015 amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act outlined a pecking order the secretary of labour is meant to follow. The 65,000 annual cap is also exceeded because of exceptions and rollovers that put the annual figure at over 180,000 last year.The flood of H1B applications does make the reviewing and awarding of visas a slow process. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services centre in California is only now processing applications made back in August, for example.Thats bad for companies like Apple and Google, led by Cook and Pichai, which seek far fewer H1Bs. Ive written before of employees being parked offshore while they await the correct paperwork, and the risks to the US of this situation continuing.In tightening the ruleshe cant unilaterally rewrite themTrump will help those tech titans that really need the talent, as evidenced by them paying such high salaries for their H1B workers.Yet he wont be doing much for manufacturers like tool maker Snap-on Inc, where he delivered his broadside. Thats because factories in Asia still offer cost benefits over the US, and Trumps decision to trade a weaker Chinese currency for assistance on North Korea shows how hard hes willing to push Beijing in the effort to ease the plight of American workers.By making bold statements about H1Bs, Trump has played to his working-class support base but also diverted attention away from dependence on Chinese manufacturing.

				Prahlads appointment last week seems to suggest that the founder-promoters, none of whom are on the board, finally have their man on it. Prahlad certainly seems to be a nominee of the founders, said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of proxy advisory and corporate governance firm InGovern Research Services. It is clear that by having Prahlad on the board, the founders want access to the board and ability to influence decisions.Prahlads Bengaluru-based firm, Surya Software Systems Pvt. Ltd, also does some business with Infosys.Infosys maintains that work done by Surya with Finacle, Infosyss core banking platform, is not large and Prahlads appointment is in compliance with the relevant definition under the Companies Act. That could well be the case. The Board receives several inputs from various quarters, and takes decisions solely in the best interest of the Company. These include CEO compensation and inductees to the Board, said a spokeswoman for Infosys. Murthy did not respond to queries on the appointment.Subramanian said his firm will surely question Infosyss decision to appoint Prahlad when the company seeks shareholder approval.An Infosys executive who spoke on condition of anonymity claimed the appointment of Prahlad was yet another indication of Murthys continued influence at Infosys. The worrying thing of this appointment of an executive perceived to be close to the founder is what message it sends to the senior leaders at the company, said the Infosys executive. If the board agrees to have a representative of the founder, then leaders clearly are told who is more important. So, can the CEO really have his team rally around him?Current chief executive officer (CEO) Vishal Sikka is Infosys first non-founder CEO. To be sure, Infosys has categorically denied the existence of twin power centres at the company. First, there is no such twin power centres. That is completely wrong, and that will be very unfair to the promoters, R. Seshasayee, non-executive chairman of Infosys, said in an interview last month. Because, like I mentioned, Murthy has been an exceptional leader who has chosen to stay away and only give advice when sought from. So it will be utterly wrong (to claim otherwise).Seshasayees response came against the background of several reports, including in Mint, that said the promoters were unhappy with the high compensation offered to Sikka, the appointment of Punita Kumar-Sinha as an independent director, the high severance package initially offered to former chief financial officer Rajiv Bansal and its subsequent termination.

				In a notification on 29 July 2015, the ministry had directed RIL, which sells LPG cylinders under the Reliance Gas brand, to restrict its own marketing of domestically produced LPG to 10,000 tonnes per month.RIL has approached the ministry requesting them to remove the cap of 10,000 tonnes per month altogether, said the first person mentioned abovean official from an oil marketing company who declined to be identified.Although the ministry has not heeded RILs request so far, there are continuous follow-ups by the company, the person added.RIL did not respond to an email questionnaire sent on 27 December. As per the LPG Control Order on regulation of supply and distribution, issued by the petroleum ministry in 2000, all cooking gas produced domestically must be supplied to state-run oil marketing companiesBharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC). As per the ministrys order, RIL sells the LPG produced at its two refineries at Jamnagar, Gujarat, to public sector retailers. However, under a Parallel Marketing Scheme (PMS), private companies are allowed to import and market LPG to bulk consumers.In July 2016, RIL launched its small-capacity 5-kg cylinders, which qualify as free trade LPG (FTL). This means they are not subsidised by the government, unlike the commonly used 14.2-kg domestic cylinders. The larger capacity cylinders are sold at market price to consumers who have the option of receiving a government subsidy in their bank accounts. Private firms are not entitled to government subsidies, unlike state-run oil marketing companies, and have to sell fuel at market price. But with the governments bid to restrict the volume of subsidy by barring consumers earning more than Rs10 lakh per annum from taking advantage of subsidised LPG, an attractive market for LPG has opened up to private players such as RIL.",2017-01-10,8sPLXhCZngGwbtYpj8eYWN,"RIL plea comes following a Central govt notification that the Reliance Gas brand to restrict its own marketing of domestically produced LPG to 10,000 tonnes per month",competitor,09:58,RIL seeks removal of LPG cap 
-1.0,"Mumbai: Dell Technologies, the company that was formed when Dell Inc. acquired EMC Corp. for $67 billion, remains bullish on its long-term growth prospects in India, which is the companys third-largest market.
				   
				I think we are on track to hit the $3 billion revenue mark in this country in a couple of years, Thomas Sweet, executive vice-president and chief financial officer (CFO), Dell Inc., said in an interview last week.Explaining why he is bullish on the Indian market, Sweet reasoned that the country now had a government that is pro-growth, pro-development, and which is also pro-technology in helping to enable that growth and the governments mission. Further, he claimed that the Dell-EMC combine in India is growing faster than the domestic IT market growth. According to Nasscoms Strategic Review 2017 report, in FY2017, Indias domestic IT-BPM (information technology-business process management) market is likely to grow 8.5% year on year to reach $38 billion (excluding e-commerce).To accelerate the pace of growth globally, Dell rolled out a distribution, or the so-called channel strategy in February. According to Sweet, half of the companys revenue is routed through its distributors and his company hopes to increase their output with the recent reorganization it initiated to bring together the distribution partners of the erstwhile Dell and EMC companies.What the company did two months back, according to Sweet, was to merge the EMC and Dell sales forces (which existed as separate entities before the merger) into two units. One is an enterprise sales unit that would now focus on the top 3,000 customers, and the second is a commercial sales organization that will focus on an estimated 500,000 clients. Sweet said he is pretty pleased with how the combined sales units have shaped up so far.The company also plans to sharpen its focus on its digital transformation push. Dell Technologies breaks up digital transformation into three parts, according to Sweet: IT transformation-how IT can support what the business needs; security transformation-how a company can tackle multiple threats; and workforce transformation-how an organization makes its employees more productive in a mobile environment.In the past couple of years, most large technology solution providers such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. (HPE), International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), Accenture Plc., Oracle Corp., Cisco Systems Inc., Microsoft Corp. and others have been competing fiercely for the increasingly lucrative digital transformation pie. According to research firm International Data Corp. (IDC) forecasts, global spending on digital transformation technologies is projected to be more than $1.2 trillion in 2017an increase of 17.8% over 2016.There is clearly a greater focus among our customers on digital, but most of them are currently focused on IT transformation, said Sweet. According to him, companies are looking to modernize their IT infrastructure to support cloud-native applications. In cloud computing, companies can consume IT services and only pay for the applications or infrastructure they use rather than buy the equipment upfront, thus reducing capital expenditure (capex).One change in the way technology adoption occurs in companies, according to Sweet, is the growing involvement of top management, especially when it comes to digital. We are seeing more C-suite executives, particularly the chief executive officers (CEOs), chief operating officers (COOs) and CFOs, participating in the conversation on digital as, increasingly, they are seeking business solutions and business model evolution, he said. The focus for CFOs, he said, continues to be on return on investment, even as most of them are also ready to bet on emerging technologies that are still not mature in order to future-proof their organizations.Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst of Greyhound Research, said that while the Dell-EMC combine has done a good job of integrating the channel network of both the organizations, managing the reskilling of the partners and introducing customised solutions tailored for specific industry segments may require an intensive focus, especially in the short term. If they can manage this aspect well, they can have an edge in the digital transformation infrastructure market, where companies such as HPE and Lenovo have been showing renewed aggression of late, he concluded.",2017-04-20,8zt0QeSnAcmHk0KChVPycN,Dell Inc.

As of 31 March 2017, the firm has closed the fund at $350 million, Nitin Jain, chief executive-global asset and wealth management, Edelweiss, said in an interview.The fund achieved a first close of $205 million in June 2015.ESOF II, which invests in privately negotiated collateralized credit transactions, has raised funds from several institutional investors including public pensions and insurance companies. ESOF I had raised $230 million.Edelweisss second credit fund comes at a time when a host of other firms in the alternative investment space are in the market to raise credit-focused funds. These include the likes of Reliance AIF Asset Management Co. Ltd, Avendus Capital and private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. Lp and Baring Private Equity Asia.Credit products in the alternative investment space are seeing a sharp increase as investors hunt for higher yields in a lower interest rate environment, said Jain.Increasingly, you are seeing that fixed income yields are becoming low. So, then, there is a hunt for yield. People want a higher yield, but a fixed income nature product. So a lot of interesting, absolute return products are getting traction in the market, which are alternate in naturethey can be credit funds or they can be hedge funds, said Jain.People want double-digit returns and low volatility, so a lot of products are being created to deliver yields between 10-14% using credit, he added.The hunt for higher yields has also made other products such as public sector bank perpetual bonds or AT1 bonds (additional tier 1 bonds) attractive to investors, said Jain.Perpetuals have become attractive and the need for higher yield is again driving that trend. Public sector banks are giving you a yield of anywhere between 9% and 10.5%. When you go to fixed deposits, youre getting only 7-7.5%. While they have a slightly different risk profile, people are getting very comfortable with them, said Jain.Led by Jain, the Edelweiss asset and wealth management business today manages assets worth Rs1.2 trillion, with over Rs60,000 crore worth of assets on the domestic wealth management side and the rest coming from the institutional asset management business.Edelweisss wealth management business caters to individuals across three categoriesmass affluent, high net-worth individuals (HNI), and ultra HNI and family offices. The asset management business includes funds which invest in credit strategies across asset classes such as real estate, performing credit and distressed credit (including the Edelweiss asset reconstruction business) as well as public market funds. The firms wealth management business, which was set up in 2010, has witnessed a growth of almost 70-80% in the last two years, said Jain.Edelweiss is targeting a corpus of Rs1 trillion for its wealth management business, which it hopes to achieve in the next two years, he said. For growing the wealth management business, we are tapping new generation entrepreneurs, family offices and employees in progressive organizations in sectors such as IT services and financial services, said Jain.In order to achieve its planned growth, Edelweiss is also investing heavily in technology.Technology is playing a very important role now. Clients want to access information, flow of information, practically on a real-time basis. Earlier it was acceptable if you told people the health of their portfolio once a quarter. Now, there are clients who want to track it on a minute by minute basis, he said.The firm has embarked on a five-year digital transformation drive and has partnered with IT consulting and services firm IBM to help drive the transformation, said Jain.Edelweisss digital transformation drive is focused on increasing the productivity of its advisory team, while helping control costs to improve both the revenue and profit of the business.

-0.23,"US President Donald Trump and members of Congress from both parties have vowed to overhaul the visa programmes used by corporations to bring overseas workers to the US. Thats left companies that rely on such workers and those that source them bracing for change. 
				   
				A first step came at the end of March, when the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) department issued guidelines making it harder for companies to bring foreign technology workers to the US using the H-1B visa programme.Whats the H-1B programme do?It allows companies to recruit 85,000 employees from abroad each year for specialty positions in fields including technology, science, medicine, architectureeven fashion modelling. It took less than a week for applicants to exhaust that allotment in 2016, and technology companies including Facebook Inc., Google Inc., Intel Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. have sought to increase the number available. People from India receive more H-1B viss  than any other nationality.What changes were made? For H-1B visas given out in the 2017 lottery beginning 3 April, the government now requires additional information for entry-level computer programmers, to prove the jobs are complicated and require advanced knowledge and experience. Computer programmers made up about 12% of all H-1B applications certified by the department of labour in 2015. Also Read: H-1B visas to become harder to get as Donald Trump starts crackdownIn March, the immigration department suspended a program that expedited visa processing for certain skilled workers who paid extra, which some analysts saw as a first step to dismantling the H-1B program altogether.Which other programs are under scrutiny?Apart from the best-known H-1B visa, companies use a variety of visas to bring in workers from abroad, including the B-1 for temporary business visitors and the L-1 for managers, executives and specialized workers of international companies.Why does the US have these programmes?They were designed to allow US companies to hire temporary workers from other countries when they couldnt find qualified people domestically. These temporary visas were established under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. The programs have morphed over the years, and many of the visas now go to companies that pay foreign workers less than their American counterparts would receive. The total number of visas issued for temporary employment-based admission to the US grew to more than 1 million in 2014 from just over 400,000 in 1994, according to the Congressional Research Service. Those numbers included some unskilled and low-skilled workers, plus accompanying family members.Do the programmes need reform?Its pretty clear the H-1B program and others have been used in ways that contradict their original intent. There have been allegations of abuse and at least one big settlement: In 2013, a Bangalore-based outsourcing company, Infosys Ltd., agreed to pay a record fine of $34 million to settle US allegations that it sent employees to the US with B-1 visitor visas to sidestep the caps on H-1Bs.What does Trump propose?During his presidential campaign, he said the H-1B program is a cheap labour program that takes jobs from Americans. He hasnt yet detailed his ideas as president, but based on a draft executive order, his administration may push companies to try hiring American workers before turning to foreign onesa step that isnt necessary now. Hes also asked that the programmes prioritize giving visas to the most highly paid workers from abroad. Who gets priority now?Currently, H-1B visas are allocated by random lottery, with no priority given to companies that pay workers more. The biggest recipients of the visas are outsourcing companies, including Indias Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., Wipro Ltd. and Infosys. They pay workers in the programme an average of about $65,000 a year, while Apple Inc., Google and Microsoft Corp. pay their H-1B employees more than $100,000.Can Trump act on his own?An executive order can begin the reform process, but Trump lacks the broad powers of Congress. For example, he cant change the number of H-1B visas that are given out each year, but he probably can change the way theyre allocated. So he could order that priority be given to higher-paid workers.What might Congress do?Congress has tried many times in the past decade to change the work visa programmes, with limited effect. Bills offered in the House by two California lawmakers, Republican Darrell Issa and Democrat Zoe Lofgren, aim to do so by raising the wages for some H-1B workers.Also Read: H1B visa: Computer programmer wont qualify as specialty occupation , says USIn Lofgrens proposal, companies that are the heaviest users of the programme would have to pay salaries of at least $130,000, up from the current $60,000, or attest that they are not displacing American workers and making a good faith effort to recruit US workers if they pay less than that. The legislative push has spooked Indias tech companies, weighing on their stocks. Theres also a bipartisan proposal in the Senate, long pushed by Republican Chuck Grassley and Democrat Richard Durbin, that would forbid replacing US workers with H-1B hires and prioritize visa applications from people who earned degrees at American colleges.Will Silicon Valley be hurt by the changes?It depends on the details, of course, but the US tech industry may well come out on top. Because so many H-1B visas go to outsourcing firms, American employers like Apple, Google, Microsoft Corp. and Facebook havent been able to get as many as they would like. They could be benefit if outsourcers face more restrictions.

				When the companys US restaurants started serving Egg McMuffins and other morning fare at all hours in 2015, the change elated customers and fueled a yearlong sales surge. But now the effect is waning: While overall earnings beat analysts estimates last quarter, domestic same-store sales fell 1.3%.The slowdown from all-day breakfast leaves McDonalds in search of its next big source of US growth. The company is looking to technology, such as touch screens and mobile ordering, to help fuel domestic sales. But its not clear how quickly that will pay off, said Michael Halen, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.We still dont know where the sales are going to come from, he said. People are in wait-and-see mode. McDonalds shares fell as much as 2% to $119.82 on Monday after the results were posted. The stock gained 3% last year.The picture was brighter overseas. Globally, same-store sales rose 2.7%, topping the 1.4% gain predicted by analysts. Profit was $1.44 a share in the period, compared with an estimate of $1.41.In some markets, including the UK and Germany, McDonalds is further ahead with technology upgrades such as self-service kiosks. Sales in the companys international lead markets segment, which includes those key countries, rose 2.8% in the fourth quarter. McDonalds generates about two-thirds of its revenue outside the US, and the company has said its turnaround effort is further along aboard.ALSO READ: IBM touts Donald Trump-pleasing hiring plans while firing thousandsMcDonalds has said it plans to accelerate its technology spending. The investment will help fund new self-serve kiosks at US restaurants and expand a smartphone ordering app across its 14,000 domestic locations, starting this year. The company has lagged behind competitors on the technology front. Starbucks Corp. and Dunkin Donuts boast millions of rewards-program members, while Taco Bell allows diners to order via mobile app. Those types of programs frequently allow restaurants to lock in customers.Challenging comparisonChief executive officer Steve Easterbrook embarked on a turnaround at the worlds largest fast-food chain when he took the helm two years ago. Expanding breakfasta longtime request of customerswas a key part of the strategy, and it helped pull McDonalds out of a domestic sales slump last year. But the sales bump has waned.The company blamed its US sales decrease in the fourth quarter on the challenging comparison with the all-day breakfast boost it got a year earlier.McDonalds also has worked to improve its food quality, a bid to appeal to a new generation of American diners. That includes removing artificial ingredients from popular items on its menu, eliminating preservatives from chicken nuggets and nixing high-fructose corn syrup from its buns. In other moves, McDonalds declared its chicken antibiotic-free in the US, added real butter to its breakfast muffins and pledged to use cage-free eggs.But McDonalds still faces an industrywide restaurant slowdown, bringing pressure to lower prices and offer more aggressive promotions. The breakfast change alone isnt enough. It was a bad quarter in the industry, Halen said.

				A divided board, said the proxy firm, will have wider ramifications. Tata group companies ease of access to finance and the cost of finance tend to be favourabledriven by the implicit understanding that these belong to the Tata group, and that credit support from group companies will always be available, whether explicitly provided or not.But, there is now, a real possibility that boards of listed companies may choose to ignore Tata Sons. This is likely to make lenders nervous, and they may show restraint in extending any further credit, until there is clarity regarding the evolving relationship between Tata Sons and the operating businesses. This will have operational implications for listed companies as on 31 March 2016, the Tata group of companies had outstanding debt aggregating around Rs.2.5 trillion, of which about 24% is due within 12 months.

0.06,"Indian IT companies reported among the weakest set of results in the September quarter. In what is traditionally a seasonally strong period for the sector, large companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Wipro Ltd reported either flat revenue or a decline compared to the June quarter. Ahead of the earnings season, analysts had warned that investors should brace for what is likely to be the weakest performance since the global financial crisis.
				   
				But things turned out to be far worse than expected, especially in the case of TCS, where revenues were far below expectations, and Mindtree Ltd, which reported a 3% sequential decline in revenue.Still, IT stocks have done fairly well since the results season began. Shares of TCS, Wipro and HCL Technologies Ltd have risen between 3.5% and 4.5% since 14 October, beating the 1.4% rise in the Nifty during the period. Infosys Ltd has fallen by 1.2%, despite the fact that the company clearly beat all of its peers in terms of growth last quarter. But investors seem to be worried about its weak guidance about the rest of the year, although it must be noted that Infosys appears to have been overly conservative with its guidance.Overall, IT results and the post-results commentary gave enough reasons for worry. But on the contrary, IT investors seem to be cheering the results. What gives?Of course, there are different factors at play with each of these stocksfor instance, investors seem to be excited with Wipros bold acquisition moves, despites its continued weak performance on the revenue growth front. With HCL Tech, growth met the Streets expectations, thanks to continued strength in its infrastructure management services practice. HCL Techs margins have turned out to be better than expectations for two quarters in a row, which has come as a relief as well.As pointed out in this column earlier, the rise in TCS shares is a mystery, especially since its revenue growth of 1% was far lower than expectations. But investors reaction to the companys results is symptomatic of the overall approach to IT sector allocations in portfolios.Growth may have fallen off the cliff, but investors are clearly not seeing this as the end of the world. They continue to value top IT stocks at 17-18 times estimated earnings for FY17, reflecting a view that growth will come back after a hiatus.

				That query posed by Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev at the Isha Foundations annual leadership workshop for entrepreneurs resonated with many attendees, including Deepak Satwalekar, the former managing director and chief executive officer of HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. Ltd.It makes you think and reflect on what your priorities should be. Dont go around trying to fix the world. Fix yourself first, and the rest will follow, said Satwalekar, who has been a resource leader at the annual event since it first started five years ago with the aim of helping small businesses scale up.This year, INSIGHT: The DNA of Success programme, led by Sadhguru, will take place from 24 to 27 November and will feature State Bank of India chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya, Piramal Group and Shriram Group Chairman Ajay Piramal, former Kellogg and INSEAD dean Dipak Jain, former Britannia Industries Ltd MD Vinita Bali, TeamIndus fleet commander Rahul Narayan, Shoppers Stop Ltd non-executive vice-chairman B.S. Nagesh, and textiles minister Smriti Zubin Irani. Mint is a partner of the programme.So what draws so many corporate leaders, academics and entrepreneurs to the event held every year at the Coimbatore headquarters of Sadhgurus Isha Foundation?You will learn several things that you were not taught in management school or at work, and get a chance to be inspired by Sadhguru, said Shanker Annaswamy, the former MD of IBM India Pvt. Ltd.For instance, the workshop helped Sapan Jain summon the courage to leave his corporate job at International Business Machines Corp. and start reverse logistics service provider Blubirch, and alter his entire approach towards problem-solving. It taught him to focus on the variables he could control rather than obsessing over the potential consequences of a situation, ranging from the departure of a key employee to a promised investment falling through.All of us read business books. All of us hear business leaders. Sometimes, (all of that) beyond a point can get vegetative and monotonous. When you hear a different perspective which is still very pragmatic and practical (such as Sadhgurus), it makes a lot of sense, Jain said.Vikash Agrawal, the promoter of power plant equipment maker Hi-Tech Systems & Services Ltd. (HTSSL), agreed.The insights he gleaned there have become a kind of another management book for me, said Agrawal, who is planning to attend the event yet again this year.Agarwal has made sure to implement some of the business lessons he learned at the event, including the fail early concept and the 90-day rule proposed by BRICS Bank chief K.V. Kamath in a bid to set a limit on the time a company should pilot a new idea before moving on.This is exactly why management gurus such as Ram Charan recommend the workshop.The single most reason (that makes this workshop unique) is that the learning is done from the practitioners, Charan said.The resource leaders, who act as informal mentors to entrepreneurs at the event, come from diverse backgrounds and sectors, making it almost a certainty that a participant will find someone he or she will be able to relate with personally and professionally, former attendees said.Also, unlike years past, this years event will include more structured modules on specific topics and include more women and people from the manufacturing, said programme facilitator Nagesh.For Nagesh, the biggest challenge is to make the workshop equally appealing to somebody whose companys sales are Rs10 crore and another who runs a Rs1,000 crore firm. That said, he believes the programme is fairly unique because of the fact that the spiritual part is actually integrated into it. The events faculty chair, Dipak Jain, too has been fascinated by Sadhgurus focus on inner engineering.First you have to be a better person before you start a better business or a better society, Jain said.The programme has proved to be an eye opener for not just the entrepreneurs but also for those who have been past speakers or mentors.Everyone has their own struggle and sometimes understanding how others dealt with their own challenges, can give us the inspiration to move forward, said Dr. Reddys Laboratories Ltd co-chairman and CEO G.V. Prasad.Prasad encouraged entrepreneurs to practise a mantra he learned from Sadhguru that those who want to scale up must learn to let go of their current state without fear and move to a higher plane, akin to trapeze artists, while Satwalekar urged them to stay hungry for knowledge, learn to prioritise, surround themselves with smarter people and not be afraid of failure.For many, like Varda Shine, the former CEO of De Beers Diamond Trading Co, the main draw of the program is Sadhguru, whose way of looking at leadership and success is much wider than any other business learning.And former participants across the board have a simple piece of advice for anyone looking to attend the event this year.As Anupal Banerjee, senior vice president  human resources, Viacom18 Media Pvt.

				Consolidated net profit is likely to increase to Rs7,282.5 crore on a revenue of Rs63,669.9 crore for the three months ended on 30 September, according to a Bloomberg poll of six analysts. In the year-earlier quarter, the company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs6,720 crore and revenue of Rs75,117 crore. RIL will announce its second-quarter earnings on Thursday. After six consecutive sequential earnings increases, we expect RILs standalone earnings to moderate 2% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), mainly due to weaker refining. But, RIL may surprise again. We expect another record petchem EBIT, said Nomura Research in a 7 October note to clients. Ebit stands for earnings before interest and taxes and is an indication of a companys profitability. RILs refining and marketing business, which accounts for over 75% of revenue and more than 60% of profit, could be hurt due to lower refining margins.Analysts expect RILs gross refining margin (GRM) to be $9.5-10 per barrel. GRM is the realization from turning every barrel of crude oil into finished products. We estimate GRM to be down 10% QoQ (quarter on quarter) while throughput 7% higher QoQ following a restart of special economic zone crude distillation unit after 20 days maintenance shutdown in May 2016. Refining EBITDA will therefore fall 6% QoQ, said Edelweiss Research in a 5 October report. During the September quarter, Singapore GRM averaged at $5.1 per barrel compared with $5 in the preceding three months.We expect RIL to report a $10 GRM versus $11.5 in 1Q, the latter including $2 of hedging & inventory gains, said Citi Research in its report dated 4 October. Earnings from the petrochemicals segment, however, are expected to rise on higher volume and wider margins. We expect petchem earnings to show strong growth led by higher volumes (some expansion projects are gradually reflecting in earnings) and improved spreads in the polymer chain, said IDFC Securities in a report dated 5 October. On the exploration and production (E&P) front, which includes domestic assets and US shale gas assets, the second quarter could also be a loss-making one for RIL as crude oil and domestic gas prices are lower compared to last year. Production from the KG block is also expected to be lower. RIL is likely to report losses in a small EBIT profit on domestic E&P. US shale will continue to remain loss-making. Crude oil and domestic gas prices are lower year-on-year.

				State-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) together plan to set up a 60-million tonnes a year oil refinery on west coast to meet the rising fuel needs of the country. Saudi Aramco and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (Adnoc) are talking to us for investments in the Indian oil sector, Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said at the Global Natural Resources Conclave.Later talking to reporters, he said Aramco is interested in picking a stake in the west coast refinery while Adnoc is keen on petrochemical projects. Aramco is talking of stake in the refinery, he said. He, however, did not go into how much stake the Saudi national oil company will pick. Lets see, is all he said. IOC holds a 50% stake in the project while BPCL and HPCL have 25% each. The 60-mt a year refinery will be set up in two phases, along with a mega petrochemical complex. The phase-1 capacity will be 40 mt together with an aromatic complex, naphtha cracker unit and a polymer complex. This will cost Rs1.2-1.5 lakh crore and will come up in 5-6 years from the date of land acquisition. The mega complex will require 12,000-15,000 acres and land on the Maharashtra coast has been identified, he said. The second phase, involving a 20 mt refinery, will cost Rs 50,000-60,000 crore. IOC has been looking at the west coast for a refinery as the company found it tough to cater to requirements in West and South with its refineries mostly in the North. HPCL and BPCL too have been looking at a bigger refinery because of constraints they face at their Mumbai units. The mega west coast refinery will produce petrol, diesel, LPG, ATF (aviation turbine fuel) and feedstock for petrochemical plants in plastic, chemical and textile industries in Maharashtra. A top official at one of the state refiners said the project will be funded with 60% debt and 40% equity.The three refiners will chip in Rs72,000 crore in equity. Fifteen mt a year is the biggest refinery any public sector unit has set up at one stage. IOC recently started its 15 mt unit at Paradip in Odisha. Reliance Industries holds the distinction of building the biggest refinery in India till now. It built its first refinery at Jamnagar in Gujarat with a capacity of 27 mt, which was subsequently expanded to 33 mt.It built another unit adjacent to it for exports, with a capacity of 29 mt.  The refinery being planned by the state-owned firms will be bigger than that. The phase-1 itself will be bigger than any one single unit. India has a refining capacity of 232.06 mt, which exceeded the demand of 183.5 mt in 2015-16.

In March 2016, Lenskart, run by Lenskart Solutions Pvt.

However, the need to create an independent website, mobile application (currently work in progress) and retail stores for John Jacobs lies in the fact that it caters to a different market segment than Lenskart, said Bhattacharya. While Lenskarts vision is to become a (multi-brand) retailer, (focus on) tier 2 expansion, go on to provide affordable access to eyewear, it made more sense to create John Jacobs a separate (premium) brand because we are solving a different problem... (Through John Jacobs) we are building to be in the affordable luxury segment, he said. A team of 32, the stand-alone brand John Jacobs targets 25-35-year-olds, selling them eyewear at an average price of Rs4,000. 90% of its sales come through its retail stores. Clocking an average of over $830,000 in monthly revenues, the company expects John Jacobs to register $10 million revenue for fiscal 2016-17, up jump from $4 million.The premium brand also retails through shop-in-shop agreement with retail stores of Shoppers Stop, and services online orders from Australia, Philippines and the UK.

				The theme of this years report, Technology for People, is a call to action for business and technology leaders to actively design and direct technology to augment and amplify human capabilities. The report states that we are beginning to see the emergence of technology for people, by peopletechnology that seamlessly anticipates our needs and delivers hyper-personalized experiences.Accenture identifies five emerging technology trends that are essential to business success in todays digital economy:AI is the new UI: Artificial intelligence (AI) is coming of age, tackling problems both big and small by making interactions simple and smart. AI is becoming the new user interface (UI), underpinning the way we transact and interact with systems. Seventy-nine per cent of survey respondents agree that AI will revolutionize the way they gain information from and interact with customers.Design for humans: Technology design decisions are being made by humans, for humans. Technology adapts to how we behave and learns from us to enhance our lives, making them richer and more fulfilling. Eighty per cent of executives surveyed agree that organizations need to understand not only where people are today, but also where they want to beand shape technology to act as their guide to realize desired outcomes. Ecosystems as macrocosms: Platform companies that provide a single point of access to multiple services have completely broken the rules for how companies operate and compete. Companies dont just need a platform strategy, they need a rich and robust ecosystem approach to lead in this new era of intelligence. Already, more than one-quarter (27%) of executives surveyed reported that digital ecosystems are transforming the way their organizations deliver value.Workforce marketplace: The number of on-demand labour platforms and online work-management solutions is surging. As a result, leading companies are dissolving traditional hierarchies and replacing them with talent marketplaces, which in turn is driving the most profound economic transformation since the Industrial Revolution. A case in point: 85% of executives surveyed said they plan to increase their organizations use of independent freelance workers over the next year.The uncharted: To succeed in todays ecosystem-driven digital economy, businesses must delve into uncharted territory. Instead of focusing solely on introducing new products and services, they should think much biggerseizing opportunities to establish rules and standards for entirely new industries. In fact, 74% of the executives surveyed said that their organization is entering entirely new digital industries that have yet to be defined.",2017-01-27,BvvNfRIjjAMtxFALZUT26J,Accenture identifies five emerging technology trends that are essential to business success to power digital economy,competitor,13:40,"Accenture report forecasts technology for people, by people"

				Infosys had agreed to pay Bansal a severance amount of Rs17.38 crore or 24 months of salary, but the company suspended payments after he got Rs5 crore as co-founder N.R. Narayana Murthy and others objected to the severance package as excessive. According to sources, Bansal has invoked his rights to an arbitral tribunal and a meeting is scheduled next month. This has opened another battle front for Infosys, which is already fighting visa clampdown by US President Donald Trump and global headwinds. When contacted, Bansal declined to comment. The company has already clarified on the severance package for the former CFO Rajiv Bansal through a detailed statement. We do not have anything additional to add at this point, Infosys said in an e-mailed response.

-0.59,"The Indian market looks expensive at current levels, according to Sanjeev Prasad , senior executive director and co-head of Kotak Institutional Equities. In a telephone interview, Prasad said  the best of Indias macroeconomic scenario was behind us, but earnings could  see a significant improvement going ahead, due to a very low base for sectors like banking and commodities. 
				   
				Edited excerpts: How do you view the Indian market at this point of time, with benchmark indices at two-year highs? Do you think there is froth building up, or is there value in the market?It is not a cheap market. If we get 5-6% returns from here for the rest of 2017 for the frontline indices, we should be happy. The mid-cap and small-cap space, however, is very expensive. We may find one or two names here and there, but largely, they are pricey.Most parts of the market are quite fully valued. In some cases such as consumer staple and discretionary sectors, they are even discounting fiscal year 2019 earnings. There is value only in parts of the market.There is value in a few sectors such as corporate banks and IT service companies, assuming potential positive developments in those sectors. For example, the corporate-focused banking sector could see a re-rating if there is some resolution on the NPL (non-performing loans) problem. Similarly, IT stocks are inexpensive given the markets concerns regarding immigration and taxation issues in the US. If these issues play out with limited impact for the IT companies, the sector could see a re-rating. What is your take on the pharmaceutical sector at this point of time?There is some value selectively in stocks such as Cipla Ltd, Aurobindo Pharma Ltd... Aurobindo is cheap at 13 times FY19 P/E (price-to-earnings ratio). Cipla is also at 16.5 times FY19 earnings. Even Lupin is not looking too bad at 17.5 times FY19 earnings. The issue with this sector at large is that there is a fair amount of uncertainty on the pricing environment in the US. The uncertain pricing environment stems not so much from regulatory-led pricing challenges as market-led pricing challenges.In many of the generic products or segments where these companies operate, they have started to see a lot more competition. Clearly,  profitability which had been very high on these molecules has and will start coming down. At the same time, because of the US FDA-related issues, these companies have not been able to introduce new molecules in their ANDA (abbreviated new drug application) pipelines in the US market. The current portfolio has started to see price erosion, and introduction of new products has got delayed at the same time. When do we see a significant recovery in corporate earnings?The funny thing about Indias earnings is that when we look at the top 50-100 large cap names, a disproportionately high share comes from global sectors such as IT and pharma, global commodity sectors and regulated sectors such as power utilities. So, irrespective of level of activity in the domestic economy, the earnings numbers can move in a different fashion. That has exactly what has happened over the last two-three years. Since early 2015, we have seen a very big improvement in Indias macroeconomic parametersInflation came down significantly and current account deficit has also declined sharply. However, earnings growth  between FY14 and FY16 has been flat, if you look at Nifty-50 companies. One of the reasons for this was the collapse of global commodity prices  oil and metals, which hurt the earnings of upstream oil companies and metal producers. Also, we saw a slowdown in earnings for IT companies, and we also had company-specific USFDA issues affecting the profits of the pharma companies.Lastly, while banking should have done better with the economy improving, we had the problems of bad loans in the banking sector, which relates to the rapid expansion in wholesale credit in the last economic cycle. That is the dichotomy of Indias economy and earnings.Going forward, I do not see much of improvement in Indias macroeconomic parameters from where we are. Inflation has bottomed out, and will go higher from here to about 4-5%. If you look at interest rates, they have bottomed out too. Current account deficit may gradually widen, but may still be manageable. However, we could potentially see a big jump in earnings numbers and the reason for that is the very low base for sectors such as the banking and commodities. We expect credit costs for the banks to decline from 2HFY18, which will result in higher profits of the corporate banks. Also, the improvement in global commodity prices and implementation of anti-dumping duties on steel will lead to a sharp increase in the profits of the upstream oil & gas companies and the metals sector in FY18.What is your take on GDP numbers that came out last week? The issue is that the proxies that are used to make these estimates are largely from the formal sectors. It is not very clear how much of the impact on the informal sectors is captured in this data. So, it is possible that once more data points come out, we will a have more informed view on the third-quarter GDP data and we may even see some downward revision to the current numbers. However, it appears that the impact of demonetisation is not as high as was originally feared by the market.In recent times, we have seen the TataMistry spat and some issues also spiking up at Infosys Ltd between founders and the management. What impact do you think such instances can have on the reputation of Indian companies?I would not want to comment on specific companies, but I think as a general fact, there may be challenges when there is a generational change in a way. Most of the Indian companies have founder-promoters or very long-serving professional managers who play a huge role in building the company and more importantly, the culture of the firm. The firm gets largely identified with the founder-promoter or with the professional manager, and these individuals typically have a very dominant influence on their companies. Some of the companies have put in a proper succession plan while some others have been somewhat lagging on this aspect. I would think a proper succession plan under which the successor is identified early enough and works with the incumbent for a longish period will address the issue of any discontinuity and discord. Finally, the boards of companies have to play a far bigger role in ensuring a smooth transition of power.How viable is it to run the telecom business in India?I think the telecom business model has changed dramatically in that companies will have to offer much higher data capacity to the customers, which can meet all the telecom requirements of the customer. Companies will have to work out the ARPUs  (average revenue per user) that can financially support a much higher capacity usage by customers. The traditional model of pricing every service individually to the customer is dead. What Reliance Jio is trying to do is to up the game in terms of offering a lot of capacity to customers at a competitive ARPU, which makes sense to it based on its business plan and strategy. There is a paradigm shift that is happening in the telecom sector in that it will entail much higher investment by the companies in data capacity.",2017-03-08,CnLQtTnllIiynet9bV0C4I,"Irrespective of the level of activity in the domestic economy, the earnings numbers can move in a different fashion, says Kotak Institutional Equitiess Sanjeev Prasad",competitor,07:57,"Indian market expensive currently, value in corporate banks, IT: Sanjeev Prasad"
-0.25,"In his 2013 book Zen Garden: Conversations With Pathmakers, Subroto Bagchi, co-founder of IT firm Mindtree, recalls being tipped off about Shombit Sengupta ahead of their first meeting in 1999. I was told that if you did not have a budget of a crore as consulting fee, you didnt go to Shombit. But wait a minute. There was another conditionhe had to like you! he writes about the man who, he says, taught him more about brands...than anyone else in my entire career.
				   
				The trouble, though, is that Sengupta no longer wants to talk about brands. At 63, the founder and creative strategist of Shining Consulting, responsible for the consumer interface makeover of companies such as Unilever, Nestlé, Procter & Gamble, Rémy Martin, Johnson & Johnson, Wipro and Mahindra & Mahindra, would rather concentrate on his art. Its the reason why, after 40-odd years in France, he now prefers to spend 60% of his time in India. In Bengaluru, to be precise, where, many years ago, he bought a dilapidated transformer factory in Whitefield and redesigned it into an abode like no other. Its tempting to see the house, split into two wings, as a metaphor for Senguptas own life, divided between France and India, brand design and art. The two parts of the house are connected by a labyrinthine corridor; the walls have Senguptas own exuberant artworks while the floor space resembles a fairground, installed with the most dazzling collection of colourful Indian kitsch: shiny lip balms, glittery balls, skeins of crinkled cotton, stacks of glass bangles. Its all a bit overwhelming.Like the man himself. Kitted out in a sheep-print shirt, his shock of hair still more pepper than salt, Sengupta demands attention as he talks. His story is so fantastic, its hard to look away but it does not do to merely follow his words: He needs total engagement. He responds in kind, listening actively and often stepping outside himself to call you out. As he does when his wife Renee Jhala, managing director of Shining Consultingthey met while he was consulting with Wipro, where she was head of public relationswafts by: She is making me talk about the brands, he mock-complains about me, but acknowledges in the next breath that the success that followed his disruptive approach to design and branding allowed him to reboot his life as a sexagenarian to focus on art.I went into business (as a brand consultant) to earn money, Sengupta says without preamble. And I stuck around for 35 years. Art has always informed my work. But I never delivered something that only looked good; my work made businesses look good.Aesthetics, one might think, was not supposed to be the strong suit of a boy born in a camp for East Pakistan refugees in Kanchrapara, West Bengal. But early on, Sengupta developed an appreciation of his surroundings. If the Bengali Bengal was defined by poverty, the Victorian Bengal was embodied in the British-built residence of his schoolteacher-mothers friend. In Chandannagar, a row or a swim across the Hooghly, he encountered a third Bengal, a French Bengal. His father, a committed Communist and anti-British activist, had French sympathieshe was a fan of the Vincent van Gogh biopic Lust For Life, which portrayed the Dutch artists flowering in Parisand subtly communicated to the young boy that an art education, to be worthwhile, had to be French.And so it was that at the age of 19, only half-done with his course at the Government College of Art and Craft in what was still Calcutta, Sengupta bought himself a ticket to Paris for Rs2,700, the sale proceeds of his mothers gold bangles. I could barely speak English, let alone French, says Sengupta, his English still thickly accented by Bengali. But I had a skill in art and I was determined to develop it.Though Sengupta went on to join École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts de Paris, the national school of fine arts, and then studied design at École Supérieure dArts Graphiques Penninghen, formal degrees were not his forte. Perpetually short of funds and compelled to send money home, Sengupta took up any work he could find, from sweeping floors to assisting lithographers. Intelligence or leadership are not qualities you learn in school. Apprenticeship is very important. I was always drawn to writers, advocates, psychologists, performing artistesthat was the way I nurtured myself, how I learnt to converge different elements when it came to branding and design as well.A considerable part of Senguptas success as a brand guru championing a consumer connect must be laid at the door of this carefully cultivated understanding of multiple disciplines. Art was the only way I could earn. Yves Brayer, a famous artist I met at the lithographers, encouraged me to consider design communication. So I studied graphic design, applied art, photography, typography. But once in the field, I found I was completely different from everybody. Because of my multiple interests, areas of expertise and a humanist outlook, I made for a grand solutions provider. I can diagnose an ailing business the way a good doctor diagnoses a patient.Also, my language was completely different, Sengupta says. So, if a chief executive officer came to me and said his product was premium, I would ask him, whats premium about a consumer product? Affordability is a different issue but, by labelling yourself premium, youre alienating a huge market. His maverick approach included hanging out at a kirana, or neighbourhood grocery store, to figure out why large cooking-oil containers werent selling, and picking up the Britannia tag line Eat Healthy, Think Better from a Kolkata rickshaw-puller. Business magazines lavished pages on him, a colourful, plain-speaking break from the pinstriped politically correct. At its peak, the Shining client list read like the whos who of the corporate world: Prominent among them were 3M, Dow Chemicals, Carrefour, Intermarché, Corning/Newell, Henkel, Nivea, LOréal, Pernod Ricard, Reckitt Benckiser, Galerie Lafayette-Monoprix, Total Petroleum internationally, and Reliance Retail, Madura Garments, Coffee Day, Jindal Steel & Power in India. Of late, Sengupta has consciously cut down consulting engagements to a few select clients, mostly in Europe. But, out of the corner of his eye, he continues to pick up on trends and behaviours in the market. Pet among his peeves are Indian businesses that aim to be conglomerates rather than single-domain enterprises. I give them 15-20 years, they wont last beyond that, he says. Before the Tatas launched the Nano, I had said it wouldnt workand it didnt. When businesses believe in one thing, they can nurture people, build expertise. I hope the new generation will follow that path. Take Airtel. (Sunil Bharti Mittal) tried a couple of other things but his focus was one. Infosys, too, has focused on one domain. As for the young people working on start-ups, I always tell them, dont go for start-upsshorthand for make money and go awaygo for build-ups. All businesses have always been start-ups. All this new language is totally nonsense!In the second hour of our conversation, we are sitting at a worktable in his sprawling, double-height studio, with its curving walls and natural light. All around us are works old and new: Some acrylic-on-canvas frames from Senguptas 2016 Night Spirit series, depicting the owl in various mythologies; a few of the tiled Désordre installation seriesfirst made in 2008which viewers are invited to scramble like a jigsaw puzzle; multiple large canvases featuring a woman and a horse that gallerist Vickram Sethi places in a metaphysical/sexual lineage dating back to the legend of Lady Godiva. He last showed at the Institute of Contemporary Indian Art, Kala Ghoda, Mumbai, in November; a couple of exhibitions are lined up in Europe later this year. For all the workload, art has always been a mainstay for Sengupta. Art was the foundation of my work, he says simply, when I ask him how he juggled the two (he was also a weekly columnist for The Indian Express between 2009-14, and is the author of the Jalebi trilogy, on managing businesses in India). I dont sleep for more than 4-5 hours a day. Only between 1978-84 did art take a back seat, because I was setting up Shining. But even then, my sketchbook never left my side.Around 1994, I realized it was important for an artist to develop his own school of thought. Thats when I came up with the concept of Gesturism, basing it on a professors early appreciation of the kinetic energy in my works. My style changed completely after that. But Renee pointed out that my art was too Cartesian (after René Descartes, whose philosophy was the bedrock of continental rationalism), too European. I needed to re-root myself in India to define my identity, unite my French inspiration and sense of structure with the non-dogmatic, indisciplined way India uses colour. A third factor was my examination of the désordredisorder in the French sense, related to physical objectsin India.In a life so packed with activity, art and accolades, turning 60 was a milestone. Renee pushed me to devote more time to art at that juncture, says Sengupta. Fine art is pre-civilizational; design is a post-industrialization phenomenon, aiming to satisfy a human need, stated or unstated. Art, on the other hand, is completely individual; it needs no other justification. As we wind down our conversation, the canvases around us look on. Each of them bears the flamboyant Sen signature: The artist prefers to use a truncated version of the family name for his work. Interestingly, his son from his first marriage, too, shortened his name Saikat to Shoi. As Shoi Sen, marketing man-turned-lead guitarist for British band De Profundis, he opened for Iron Maiden in Bengaluru in 2009.

				On Wednesday, Alok Ohrie, president and MD, India Commercial of Dell EMC, insisted that the combined company, christened Dell Technologies, is now uniquely positioned to provide customers with solutions that will secure their digital future with a single window of engagement. The combination creates a $74 billion company with a technology portfolio which  includes virtualization company VMware, security firms RSA Systems and SecureWorks, software and services (including cloud and big data analytics) firm Pivotal, and cloud management software company Virtustream.In an interview, Ohrie said he believes there are three pillars of digital transformation: IT infrastructure transformation, workforce transformation and security transformation. Effectively, we now play in all the elements of a modern data centre, he said.Dell doesnt break up country-wise revenue, but according to estimates by Dataquest, a Cyber Media (India) Ltd Publication, Dell Indias revenue stood at Rs17,480 crore in FY 2015-16. It pegged EMC Indias revenue in 2014-15 at Rs2,452 crore (combined about Rs20,000 crore, or $3 billion).Tom Sweet, chief financial officer, Dell Technologies, recently said that the combined revenue of the two companies in India was closer to $2.5 billion.According to International Data Corp. (IDC), in the overall PC shipment for the April-June quarter of 2016, HP Inc. reclaimed its top spot with 28.4% market share, while Dell captured the second spot with 22.2% backed by focused efforts on growing branded consumer desktop category.In the India x86 (Intel-based servers) market, HP maintained its lead position in the October-December quarter of 2015 with 36% market share in terms of unit shipment, followed by Dell with a market share of 24% and Lenovo with 12%. EMC led in Indias external storage industry with a 28.4% market share in the January quarter.Nevertheless, the fact is that the shift to cloud is transforming and cannibalizing hardware markets, and technology companies, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), Oracle Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc.,  need to evolve their strategies in order to survive, according to Forrester analysts.Ohrie pointed out that Dell Technologies, with 140,000 employees, annual revenue of $74 billion and over 20,000 patents and patent applications, has over the last few years made significant investments in R&D that will stand it in good stead.Dell and EMC have made a cumulative R&D investment of $12.7 billion over the last three years and we have publicly stated that for this year, $4.5 billion of investment will be made in R&D, which is multiple times what the competition is investing, Ohrie said.

0.7,"Mumbai: The ongoing crisis in the $103 billion conglomerate is unlikely to impact Brand Tata, said Harish Bhat, chairman of Tata Global Beverages Ltd and brand custodian of the group. 
				   
				In an interview, he said that it was business as usual in all the operating companies even though the current spat had been tough to deal with at a personal level. Edited excerpts:As the custodian of the Tata brand are you concerned about brand erosion?First and foremost, the Tata brand is the result of many decades of initiatives which have to do with providing excellent products and service to our customers, which have to do with providing value back to the community, and which have to do with the highest level of corporate governance. So, this is a brand which has been built assiduously over several decades. Second is the consumers,  who buy our services and brands. Their trust in the Tata brand remains unchanged. Has the Tata brand been affected with respect to stakeholders?I would say this controversy perhaps has to some extent impacted the way some stakeholders look at the brand, and we will need to build on the brand and nurture it in the future, bearing that in mind.(Cyrus) Mistry has alleged some governance violations. As a representative of the chairman office of Tata Sons, how do you respond to that?Firstly, to have a chairman who is in open hostility with the promoter company puts at risk all the shareholders of the company. The company uses the brand name of the primary promoter company. There are credit ratings the company enjoys. People work in the company because it is part of a larger group. There are collaborations with joint venture partners which have been supported by Tata Sons.The other fact you mentioned is also very relevant. The board governance guidelines which was adopted by the board of Tata Global Beverages Ltd (TGBL) very clearly specified that if you were an employee of the company and if you were a non-executive director on the board of another Tata company and if you moved out of employment in your primary company, then you would also immediately resign from the boards of operating companies where you were a non-executive director. This was clause 2.9 of board governance guidelines which was adopted by the board of TGBL. It was adopted unanimously by the board, and the board at that time was chaired by Mistry.ALSO READ | What does Cyrus Mistry gain by trashing the Tata group?So, the question is now Mistry should also follow these guidelines which he has not done. I do believe that this is violation of the board governance guidelines. This is the second reason why we felt he should be replaced. This has been clearly mentioned in the appeal that Tata Sons has put out to all shareholders earlier this month.Isnt he still a director on the board of Tata Sons and hence an employee?A non-executive director is not an employee. He was an employee of Tata Sons until he was the chairman of Tata Sons.What about the allegations he has made about governance of the operating companiesTata Sons and Tata Trusts?I have been on the board of several operating companies of the group, and I must say that they are run independently by their own boards of directors. Our boards debate and discuss what the future strategy of the company should be, what the capital allocation should be. Those are decisions taken by the boards of the respective companies. As far as I am concerned, my experience on the boards of the companies is that the companies are independently run, are supervised by very competent boards composed of very competent and reputed independent and non-independent directors.What happens if in certain EGMs Mistry is not voted out?First and foremost I want to preface my answer to that to say that Tata Sons has issued an appeal to all our shareholders. Ratan Tata, our interim chairman has also written a letter to all our shareholders. In these letters and appeals, we have put forward our case very strongly on why the continued presence of Mistry on the boards of our operating companies can be disruptive and dysfunctional to those companies. The appeal from Tata Sons has also pointed out the corporate governance violation, which I discussed a little while ago. I am very confident that the shareholders will take those appeals and letters into account before deciding how they will vote in the best interests of the companies where they hold equity stake.ALSO READ | Tata Motors emerges as key battle in Tata vs Mistry fightFor any reason, if the situation arises, as you are describing it, then it is up to the board of Tata Sons to decide what they would like to do.

We are very keen to put the focus and spotlight very clearly on profitable growth of each operating firm within the company so that we can run as fast as required to create the right level of shareholder value. Is the group prepared for a long legal battle?The group will do whatever is right to safeguard our shareholders and safeguard all our stakes.Can you share with us whats top of your mind now?There are 2-3 things. First and foremost, I want to use this opportunity to pay tribute to all the operating companies of Tata group. Over the last few weeks, while this issue has been very actively discussed in media and in public forums, we must recognize and appreciate that for all our operating companies it has been business as usual. Also, at a personal level, the last few weeks have been very difficult for me, but not so difficult at a professional level. Let me explain why. At a personal level its difficult because any such situation for a person like me, who has been part of the Tata group for 30 years now, I think it creates anxiety. On the other hand, at a professional level, I have always borne in mind I should do what is right for the institution.ALSO READ | What if other Tata group shareholders vote the same way as those at TCS?Can you tell how you will restore the brand value which has been impacted to some extent?Two or three things. One is the principles on which the brand has been built remain unchanged. We do what is right by all our stakeholders, and they include our consumers, our financial shareholders, community, vendor partners and value chain partners and, of course, our employees.You were also a part of the group executive council under Cyrus Mistry. We understand that he was about to present a governance document which would define the relationship between Tata Sons, the trusts and the operating companies. Can you share something of that?I do not want to share in this interview any information about any documents that were being discussed in confidence. I hope you appreciate my point of view here. Having said that, yes, I was a member of the operating council under Mistry. There were specific roles that he had assigned to me in the GEC which were to do with customer-centric promoting, customer centricity and customer excellence in the group. They were to do with providing marketing support to some of the new businesses that we were incubating within Tata Sons.Were you a part of those discussions?Some discussions I was a part of, some I was not. There were discussions on many matters within the GEC. On the specific question you have asked on the governance document, I would not like to comment.Why is it that almost all the directors of Tata Global Beverages who have voted against Mistry have filed caveats against him in the Bombay high court?I do not want to comment on any legal matters. I believe the company will do whatever is right under the law.TGBL is the only listed company that has not called an EGM to remove Mistry as director?It is up to Tata Sons to decide if they want to call an EGM and in what order. Whenever Tata Sons calls the EGM, if they do and when they do, then we will have the EGM.Can you tell us what happened at the TGBL board meeting on 15 November? What was the need to move the circular resolution later? Is it an admission that it was not all kosher at the board meeting?No, absolutely not. The board meeting was conducted in strict adherence to the process of law. Whatever was the legal process required to introduce a resolution was followed to the T. Thats the first point I would like to make. I have already mentioned in an earlier interview that the reason I moved that resolution in the board meeting is because I believe, and eventually as you know seven out of 10 board members voted for that resolution, that Mr Mistrys continued presence as chairman of the board while he was also at the same time in an adversarial and hostile relationship with the primary promotor Tata Sons would be very harmful to the interests of the shareholders of TGBL.The circular resolution which was moved thereafter was without prejudice to the board meetings. It was just to re-emphasise the fact that a majority of directors were strongly in support of replacing Mistry as the chairman of the board for all the risks I pointed out earlier.What about the video recording. Why was it not made available to Mistry?Mistrys correspondence was with the company secretary of Tata Global Beverages and to the best of my knowledge the company secretary of Tata Global Beverages has responded to Mistry. I would also like to say that the law provides for the minutes of the meeting which have been recorded by the company secretary to be finalized within a period of time in case the video recording for some reason is not available. That legal process was also followed completely.In his representation to Tata Sons, Nusli Wadia said that in the case of Tata Steel, the founding fathers had given the company the name since 1907. Tata Steel existed much before Tata Sons and the brand agreement was signed only in 1998 so this needs to be examined and addressed. What are your views?I am very clear that the Tata trademark is owned by Tata Sons. The ownership of the trademark is with Tata Sons. Under a brand equity licence agreement, operating companies of the group use the trademark. So, those two facts are very clear to me and beyond that I dont want to add anything because trademark ownership is an established law in our country and indeed all parts of the world. We are also very clear that Tata Sons has added a lot of value to the Tata brand name.Do you think the independence of operating companies will be curtailed in the future?Each operating company of the Tata company is an independent organization. The board of directors of each individual company, whether it be of Titan (Co. Ltd) or Tata Global Beverages or Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), or any company of the group, the board of directors of that individual company is the one that guides the organization, which provides the strategic and governance framework for that company. We have a very competent board of directors with very competent independent and non-independent directors on each board. Having said that, each operating company of the Tata group does not exist in a vacuum. It exists as a part of the larger Tata group and I think it benefits greatly...like the use of the Tata trademark, credit rating and talent acquisition. So, you are saying that it will be status quo in the way that they are operating?I also want to say that, some of us who represent Tata Sons on the boards of these operating companies, what we do and what the entire board does is ensure that we try to maximize values for our entire shareholders into the future.Does profitable growth also entail exiting companies, which seems to be a bone of contention?(Ratan) Tatas letter to the shareholders has specified that very clearly. He has addressed the issue. He said very clearly that as a promoter, Tata Sons constantly evaluates new business opportunities and investments. Some of these investments have been successful while some others have taken time to be profitable. Our approach has been to support and fund these businesses during their development and growth phases. He has also mentioned that we will exit the business when we believe it is inviable.What are your views on where the group is headed with all these changes?See, my belief is that Tata Group is not just a corporation. It is an institution. It is an institution which is now 149 years of age. Its strongly embedded in some values which I think are dear to the institution. It symbolizes trust, it symbolizes the highest levels of corporate governance and it symbolizes doing good for the community or being a good corporate citizen. Those three fundamental pillars of the Tata brand will remain unchanged.R. Krishna Kumar, a trustee and director on the Tata Sons board, had in an earlier interview with the media shared that a succession plan for Tata Trusts is being discussed. This vindicates Cyrus Mistrys stand with respect to the governance structure of Tata Trusts, that it needs to be reworked.I do not want to comment on that. I am not part of the Tata Trusts. My relationship has been far more with Tata Sons and the operating companies. Thats a decision for Tata Sons to take. I do not wish to comment on the statement he has made.Given that you have worked Mistry for 3-3.5 years, did you see this coming?My working was with respect to all the functions he had allocated to me. And as far as Tata Sons is concerned, I do not have the visibility and would not like to comment on that. I have not been privy to those discussions and would not like to comment on that.How was it working with Mistry?I must mention this very clearly that I hold Mistry in very good personal regard. I have worked closely with him and the opportunity that he gave me to work as a member of the GEC and the specific role he gave me within the GEC. I have had several discussions with him. Those discussions were very cordial, very professional. I must say that I have not had the time so far over the last several weeks as you will no doubt realize to sit down and reflect on all those three years. But may be sometime in the future, I will do so.Was he a tough boss?How do you define tough. He was a boss who heard me out on areas I discussed with him and he would give me whatever decisions I wanted. If there was a specific area that he thought required far more intense work, he would tell me that.How is it that you and Mukund Rajan were retained and the other members of the GEC were let go?I can only talk about my performance appraisal. I also would not like to comment on other members of the GEC. I can only talk about the role I played. I did my role to the best of my capability. Whatever role was given to me, which I have already mentioned earlier. Now its up to Tata Sons and my boss at Tata Sons to judge how I performed.",2016-12-17,EReffw5Q2VhEVa25BzNgDN,Tata Global Beverages chairman Harish Bhat says its business as usual in all group firms though the Tata vs Mistry spat is tough to deal with at a personal level,company,02:38,Trust in the Tata brand remains unchanged: Harish Bhat
-0.52,"Often, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and its investors dont see eye to eye. The companys March quarter results announcement was no different. Revenue grew 1% sequentially in constant currency terms, lower than analysts estimates of around 1.6% growth. Worryingly, revenues in the mainstay North American region fell by 1.8%, and those of the key banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) vertical fell 0.4%.
ALSO READ: TCS misses both revenue and profit estimates in March quarterStill, chief executive officer (CEO) Rajesh Gopinathan said, We are quite happy with the way we have ended the year. He added on a call with analysts that the outlook for the BFSI segment remains positive, and that thanks to large deal wins, it may be only a matter of time before the expected growth comes in. TCS has been saying for the past few months that things are looking up in the US and particularly in the BFSI segment. Over 40% of its revenues come from the BFSI segment, while the North American region accounted for 54% of revenues last year.But after the March quarter performance, investors are likely to question the companys optimism. As the chart alongside shows, year-on-year growth rates have fallen significantly at TCS in the past year. Besides, operating profit margin, too, has fallen below its targeted range of 26-28%. The result of this double whammy was that earnings per share grew by just 8.3% last year.With the rupee having appreciated sharply compared to the average rate in fiscal year 2017 (FY17), margins are expected to be under further pressure in the new fiscal year. Whats more, thanks to the many changes in H-1B visa rules and policies, costs of providing on-site services to clients are also expected to rise. As such, earnings can be under pressure in FY18. Against this backdrop, TCS shares trade at around 16 times one-year forward earnings. And while CEO Gopinathan said that he expects FY18 to be incrementally positive, things could turn out to be particularly dire, depending on new visa rules. We see near-term impact on decision-making due to immigration-related issues, even as companies are denying this. We expect 1QFY18 to start slowly and do not build growth acceleration in FY18, analysts at Nomura Research wrote in a note to clients. Some of the possible impact of new visa norms is detailed here: bit.ly/2ngI48H.And unlike TCSs upbeat post-results commentary, most other technology companies including Accenture Plc. have guided for slower growth in the new fiscal year. Besides, while Infosys Ltd tried to soothe investors nerves by outlining a detailed capital allocation policy, TCS said it will stay with its existing payout policy.In sum, theres nothing much to like in TCSs March quarter results announcement, except perhaps for the managements hopeful commentary. But given the fair bit of divergence between the companys outlook three months ago and its actual performance, investors would do well to tread cautiously.",2017-04-19,EWzMpJgL08FAuJ0hukTmAP,"After the March quarter performance, investors are likely to question the optimism being shown by new TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan",competitor,07:22,"TCS results: Upbeat commentary, downbeat performance in March quarter"
0.25,"Mint reported on 3 November that Tata Sons Ltd does not have a controlling stake in several Tata group companies including Tata Steel Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd. Cyrus Pallonji Mistry is the chairman of these companies and if he doesnt resignit is clear now that he wontthe holding company of the Tatas is going to have to fight a long and possibly bruising shareholder and legal battle to get him out. 
Mint reported on 4 November, citing a person close to the ousted chairman of Tata Sons, that he will indeed not resign as chairman of the Tata operating companies. Meanwhile, Tata Sons has disbanded the Group Executive Council. Three of its five members, all Mistrys hires, have left. The other two, Tata group veterans, have survived and been assigned larger roles. Mistrys email to the board of Tata Sons, a day after he was asked to go on 24 October, has raised several questions, just as Tata Sons explanation for asking Mistry to go has. Stories repeating these questions, or proffering answers to them, have started appearing in mainstream media, signs that the PR machinery on both sides has swung into action. Mint reported details of the PR and legal teams both sides have lined up on 1 November. Tata Sons cannot afford to have Mistry continue as chairman of the operating companies, although it is unlikely to push for his exit as a director. The second will require the support of a larger group of shareholders; the first will merely need to be approved by the board in a vote. Mistry, though, is likely to push for a vote by shareholders. In 2012-13, shortly after he took over as chairman of Tata Sons, the boards of these operating companies and their shareholders approved his nomination as their chairman too, but Mistry seems to think they may not toe the Tata Sons line this time. Given that his thinking on aviation and the Tata Nano is exactly that of several analysts, he may have good reason to believe that at least some shareholders approve of his actions and will support him.ALSO READ | Tata Group firms independent directors left in the dark on Cyrus Mistry ousterSo, what is likely to happen? Before we look at scenarios, let us try and understand the interests of the two sides. Tata Trusts, the dominant shareholder of Tata Sons, and Ratan Tata, chairman of Tata Trusts, want to re-establish control over the operating companies. They have already regained control of the holding company (indeed, they were never not in control), and also removed all of Mistrys men who had group-level positions. Mistry, a person close to him says, wants to protect the Tatas (as in the group) from Tata (as in Ratan Tata and Tata Trusts), and also safeguard his familys 18.38% holding in Tata Sons. I think he also wants to save face, for surely, this is not a fight he can expect to win. Now to the scenarios.The first involves a settlement between Mistry and Tata Sons, but given the bad blood on both sides, the chances of this are remote. It is also not clear what Tata Sons could give Mistry that would make him go quietly. Still, stranger things have happened. The second involves Mistry selling his stake. The person close to Mistry who has been mentioned above says this isnt on the table. Still, if Mistry does choose to exit, he could unload his stake in Tata Sons to an activist shareholder who could prove a thorn in the side of the company, a rival business group, or a passive investor aligned with the Tatas. The third involves a protracted battleat the level of the directors of the operating companies, at the level of shareholders of the operating companies, in the media, and in courts and regulatory bodies. Id hate to see the third happen because it will end up being bad not just for the Tata group, but Indian business itself in so many ways. That said, it does seem the most likely scenario. It is also one where Mistry has nothing to lose and the Tatas, a lot. Whoever wins, in the short-term, it is the Tata group that is the loser. Many of the Tata companies face significant challenges, but their leaders are likely to be distracted by the ongoing fight (apart from being confused about who to listen to). Mistrys email has already taken some of the sheen off the groups squeaky-clean image and the allegations and counter-allegations that have begun to fly will take some more off. He may have lost his job but ensuing eventsand it has been just two weeksmean the Tata group could lose its halo. R.

1.0,"New Delhi: Sunil Munjal, who separated from his brothers in 2016 to carve an independent identity, has formed a new group company called Hero Enterprise that has started selling life and health insurance policies and plans to venture into aerospace parts. 
				   
				Hero Enterprise will, however, continue to focus on its existing real estate and steel businesses even as the group holding company consolidates its businesses and exit smaller ones such as Hero BPO.Sunil Munjal already sold motor insurance for Hero MotoCorp Ltd while he was still a part of the Pawan Munjal-led Hero Group. In an interview on Thursday, Sunil Munjal said that his insurance distribution firm, Ensure Plus, is also into non-motor insurance such as assets, buildings and aircraft. It has also started selling life insurance and health insurance policies. For life insurance, the company has a partnership with ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Ltd, while for general insurance, it has tied up with National Insurance and Tata AIG. We are the largest distributor of insurance in India... probably in the world. We wrote 10 million policies last year. Nobody does even half of it, Munjal said.Distribution is where the margin is. For us, to step back and put up an insurance company is nothing... It takes around Rs100 crore to get a licence. We have looked at that a few times but distribution is where the main margin is and relationships are. Thats where market connect is and we are very good at it, he said. Hero FinCorp Ltd, a two-wheeler financing company run by Sunil Munjals nephew Abhimanyu, also plans to get into insurance distribution and that means a larger chunk of Sunil Munjals motor insurance business that used to come from Hero MotoCorp will get affected.They will compete like any other entity. Within our group, we always had this system. We could buy and sell from our companies as well as outside. So, that ensures that everybody maintains quality and you are buying because of merit and not because it is your company, he added.Sunil Munjal, 56, stepped down as joint managing director of Hero MotoCorp Ltd, Indias largest motorcycle maker, in July 2016. By exiting Hero MotoCorp, he raised around Rs3,500 crore.Sunil Munjals businesses were a small part of the $6 billion Hero group founded by Brijmohan Lall Munjal, the family patriarch who died in 2015 at the age of 92. He had five strategic businesses: insurance distribution, Hero Realty Ltd, Hero Management Service Pvt. Ltd, Ludhiana-based Hero Steels Ltd and Hero Mindmine Institute Pvt. Ltd.Munjal has hired P.N. Gupta, a former executive from Tata Groups TAL Manufacturing Solutions, to enter the aerospace parts manufacturing. A person aware of Munjals plans in the defence sector said that he is scouting for manufacturing sites for composites.Talks are still at an exploratory stage, the person said on condition of anonymity.Munjal said that new business initiatives are not an area of public conversation and declined to comment specifically on his diversification.I have never said yes or no. I would say it is a difficult area but high potential area because India is the largest known importer, in terms of reported numbers, of defence equipment in the world, he said. In todays time, there is no reason for India to be (an import-dependent country). You have every capability and potential to build that capability (to manufacture) here in India, he added.With 60% of Indias defence requirements met through imports, local defence production has emerged at the heart of the Narendra Modi governments Make In India programme. Under Hero Realty, Munjal has completed one project in Haridwar and a couple of others are under construction in Ludhiana and Mohali. We have just closed a transaction in Gurgaon, Munjal said.We are targeting middle Indiamiddle income, middle class, lower middle class, small town, mid-sized cities, tier III, tier IV cities, and we are trying to see if we can help improve peoples standard of living itself.

-0.07,"Mumbai: The root cause of the current conflict in the Tata group is groups operating structure itself, said proxy advisory firm Institutional Investors Advisory Services (IiAS) in a research note on Saturday. The Tata Trusts exert control over Tata Sons, which exerts control over operating companies, several of which  are listed and subject to scrutiny by external stakeholders including shareholders, it said. 
				   
				While shareholders expect them to operate along commercial lines, given that the companies belong to the Tata group, these are overlaid with additional expectations regarding behaviour and the brand. According to IiAs philanthropy running a commercial business creates its own paradoxes. The Trusts elegantly solved this problem by putting Tata Sons between themselves and the operating companies: The trusts could remain philanthropic even as Tata Sons pushed businesses to deliver higher profit. The Tata group needs to address possible areas of conflict and clearly set the terms of engagement between the three tiers of the group. They need to put in place an operating structure that outlives individuals, it said. To be sure, the nine page missive issued by Tata Sons on Thursday exposed the internal conflict among the different entities. The holding company accused the ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry of betraying the trust it had reposed in him and seeking to control the main operating companies of the Tata group to the exclusion of Tata Sons and other Tata representatives. The current scenario, says the proxy firm should be used as an opportunity to fix the structural issues in the Tata Group, a representatives. IiAs suggest that in order to align the interests of the Tata Trusts and Tata Sons, the chairperson of the Tata Trusts and Tata Sons must be the same individual as this has worked smoothly in the past. It also suggests Tata Trusts and Tata Sons in future should be run by independent CEOs with roles of each defined clearly. While the chairperson should be the custodian of the Tata brand, the role of the CEO of Tata Sons should be a bit more than that of a portfolio manager. The Tata Sons CEO should monitor the performance of companies, establish dividend policy and be responsible for capital allocation between companies. Additionally, the Tata Sons CEO should ensure adherence to the brand identity, and exploit group synergies by providing common services. The CEO should have the flexibility to rebalance portfolio companies, within reason given the Tata brand is associated with these. Like in corporate boards, the Tata Sons CEO will be answerable to the board and the chairperson. He should also ensure that that costs and the bureaucracy at Tata Sons does not balloon  a recent charge, it should be desirable to cap costs as a fixed percentage.Well-defined roles and an unambiguous chain of command should ensure that all participants are clear about their roles and responsibilities. The proposed structure is likely to be beneficial for all stakeholders  the stakeholders of listed companies as well as the Tata Trusts.The battle between Mistry and Ratan Tata has been intensifying with each passing day with neither side showing signs of relenting.

				The collaboration comes more than a century after Jamshedji Tata came to this city known as the steel-making capital to understand technologies which he would later use to launch Indias own industrial revolution. Top Indian industrialist Ratan Tata, joined by Carnegie Mellon University president Subra Suresh along with Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran broke the ground of the new TCS Hall at the university campus. Supported by an unprecedented $35 million grant from TCS, which is the largest ever industry donation the CMU, the building when complete by next year, would become the hub of CMU and TCS collaborations on promoting next generation technologies that will drive the 4th Industrial revolution, Suresh said. Today, we are not looking at heavy metal and millions of tons of steel. We are looking at a collaboration of intellectual skills and the development of two countries together that might bring about global understanding between people, Tata said.Ratan Tata, Chairman emeritus of Tata Sons, described the CMU-TCS partnership a visionary collaboration of skills that will bring understanding between young people of India, the United States and other places in the world. The wide-ranging multi-national partnership that is creating new research opportunities, new student aid, and a brand-new facility for educational research that we are celebrating today has deep roots. In fact, the historical parallels and connections between the Tata Group of companies and Carnegie Tech and Carnegie Mellon make this new chapter in our partnership even more meaningful, Suresh said.In the late 19th century - years before this university was founded - the Tata family patriarch, Jamshedji Tata, came to Pittsburghthe steel capital of the worldto learn from expert steelmakers how to launch his own steel-making business in India, he said. Jamshedji Tata famously had four goals in life: setting up an iron and steel company in India, opening a world-class learning institution, building a unique cartel, and constructing a hydroelectric plant, he added. Years later, a company affiliated with one of Andrew Carnegies executives landed a contract to build the Tata plant in India, bringing to life the Jamshedji Tata goal that mirrored Andrew Carnegies lifes work: the great steel empire built here in Pittsburgh, and a great university, Carnegie Tech, now known as Carnegie Mellon as we celebrate it today, he said. Suresh said the latest addition to the rapidly-expanding CMU landscape, this nearly 50 000 gross square-foot TCS Hall will house research and academic spaces where both institutions will collaborate on mutual interests in fields such as cognitive systems and autonomous vehicles and robotics. TCS Hall will house a variety of activities in education and research, as well as the CMU Mechanical Engineering and Robotics Departments. And itll fit seamlessly into Carnegie Mellons pioneering work in leading the fourth industrial revolution, said the CMU president.

0.68," Washington: Unfazed by the possible changes to the H1B visa regime, chief executive officer (CEO) of Indias IT major TCS,  Rajesh Gopinathan has said the current discourse on the issue in the US is driven by emotions rather than economy and the best way to tackle it is through greater engagement. 
				   
				Gopinathan favoured a policy of engagement with various stake holders on the issue of H1B visas in the US. He noted that the discourse is currently driven by emotions rather than economy. The best way to tackle that is greater engagement. Because the way, sometimes, companies like us get characterised is very different from the reality of what we bring to the table, Gopinathan, who is in his mid-40s, said. Some of these engagements actually help get that message out also. People will understand us better for who we are, and I think engagement, communication and collaboration is the best way to deal with the political lack of understanding which comes. Democracy ought to deal with the emotional response that you see and you have to get over it and engage positively, Gopinathan said. He said the US has been a very welcoming market for the IT major and has provided it with a fair, open and competitive environment. All said and done, the US has been a very welcoming market for us. So you keep aside the immediate issues, its been a market that has been fair, it has been an open, competitive environment, Gopinathan told PTI, exuding confidence that TCS would be able to successfully compete in any environment. Gopinathan said TCS has competed and has won against the best in the country. We have competed and we have won against the global best in this country, on equal footing. So, it has been a market that has helped us grow in confidence as we have gone, he said but repeatedly refrained from having any complaint from the present system or the possibility of a new executive order that would adversely have an impact on his companys performance due to any action by the Trump Administration on H1B visas. US President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order that would tighten the process of issuing the H1B visas and seek a review of the system for creating an entirely new structure for awarding these visas. Gopinathan was appointed as the new CEO of TCS this January after his predecessor N. Chandrasekaran was elevated to the post of chairman of Tata Sons. Responding to questions on a potential executive order or legislations being talked about by lawmakers, Gopinathan asserted that there is no law currently in the US that is discriminatory. There are many that are being discussed, which if they were to get passed, in their extreme form would be discriminatory. So we should actually give credence to the system here, that is, as I said, it is fair. It has been fair in the past, there is no reason for us to assume that it will not be fair in the future. So, lets deal with whats on the ground and lets go step by step, he said. More importantly, we have very active STEM education engagement in the US. We work with colleges, high school students, we reach out, we have touched close to 20,000 plus students already, and significantly we are accelerate that into what we call Ignite My Future Campaign. We just target to touch one million students all in the next five years, he said. Noting that the technology market is actually under supplied, he said the sheer demand of technical skills far outstrips the supply. What weve been successful in India is to actually increase the world supply, often generating graduates way beyond what the governing systems actually provided. So we capitalised the emergence of a private sector education complex that served to provide us the talent required for our growth, he said.

				The voting pattern in recent days has been interesting. The directors on the board of Indian Hotels have backed Cyrus Mistry. The directors on the board of Tata Motors have preferred to sit on the fence for now. And the directors on the board of Tata Global Beverages have voted to remove Mistry as chairman. The two sides will have to fight it out company by company.As we have pointed out earlier, corporate governance in India is complicated because of the complex control structure in most Indian corporate groupsholding firms, investment companies and operating companies have stakes in one another. In the Tata case, a problem in the holding company has spilled over into operating companies with millions of shareholders. The ability of independent directors to vote with the interests of ordinary shareholders in mind will thus be crucial.Also read | Tata Sons board meeting on Thursday",2016-11-17,GbScNFD3FAcAwnInYyl4ZP,The role of directors on the boards of various Tata companies has also emerged as a decisive factor in the Ratan Tata vs Cyrus Mistry battles,company,01:28,Tata-Mistry spat a litmus test for corporate governance
-0.4,"Those who have known Ratan Tata well over the years vouch for his sense of fair play, his innate courtesy and his infectious smile. What they also tell you is that he conceals an iron fist in a velvet glove. When it comes to business or matters related to his business interests, this is a man who believes not in win-win but win-loseI win and you lose. He may be 78 years old and for the last four years he seems to have been content playing the benevolent angel to a clutch of technology start-ups. But if you thought he had taken his eyes off the ball, the tough words in his signed statement as the new interim chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, following the abrupt and shocking replacement of Cyrus Mistry, should put such thoughts to rest. I have agreed to do so in the interest of stability and reassurance to the Tata group. Thats not a man looking to appease anyone, not even someone he helped appoint as his successor less than four years ago.
				   
				Not surprisingly, Mistry, a proven success in his own businesses and on the board of Tata Sons since 2006, differed and departed from what Ratan Tata had set in play over the two decades that he led the group. The disconnect though, seemed normal and related to business strategy. Tata Steels global operations were the personal handiwork of Ratan Tata, something he had staked his groups future on in 2007 when he paid $12 billion to buy UK steel maker Corus Group Plc. The move catapulted Tata into the list of the worlds top steel makers but also laid the seeds for the massive losses that Mistry inherited when he took over as chairman, coincidentally around the time that the commodities cycle was turning adverse. Mistrys calculated decision to exit the business may have seemed rational to him but for the ex-chairman it must have been a bitter pill to swallow.The roles seemed reversed when it came to aviation, which was clearly a passion for Tata. Mistry may or may not have been too excited about the venture into this already crowded area but certainly the splitting of the investments into Air Asia India and Vistara seemed at odds with his style of working.Yet, these were business decisions and in a group as professional as the Tatas, must have had the collective assent of the board members, which included Ratan Tata. Nor is the latter a stranger to a new chairman stamping his authority in a new position. One of his first moves on taking over as group chairman in 1991 was to tighten his control over the various group companies. Thus, powerful satraps like Russi Mody at Tata Steel Ltd and Darbari Seth at Tata Chemicals Ltd, who under his predecessor J.R.D. Tata had pretty much the run of the place, were reined in and then eased out. This was followed by a massive restructuring exercise to create a more streamlined and capital-efficient group.ALSO READ | Cyrus Mistry ousted as Tata Sons chairman, Ratan Tata steps inSo were there other reasons for this abrupt decision? A clash of wills at this level seems churlish. That Mistry wasnt even given the option of resigning points to unprecedented and unusual circumstances and holds out the promise of more developments. In its 148-year history, the group has experimented with different chairmen for Tata Sons and Tata Trusts only once beforewhen J.R.D. Tata headed the trusts and Ratan Tata headed Tata Sons. But that was for a only short time before JRDs death and, in any case, involved two Tatas. The failure of the move to appoint an outsider to head Tata Sons while Ratan Tata retained his hold over the trusts could also mean that the next chairman may well be from the larger Tata family.

				Tata Sons Ltd has moved resolutions to eject Cyrus Mistry and Nusli Wadia as directors of Tata Steel Ltd, Tata Chemicals Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd, as the spat following Mistrys ouster as chairman of the group turns more bitter.The three operating companies announced the resolutions brought by the group holding company in separate filings to the stock exchanges on Friday.  Tata Sons controls 26.51% of Tata Motors, 19.35% of Tata Chemicals and 29.75% of Tata Steel. The development followed Tata Chemicals board meeting on Thursday at which Wadia and other independent directors backed Mistry as chairman of the board. The directors said they took into consideration his performance for the past couple of years in backing him.It is an unprecedented move by the Tatas, said Amit Tandon, managing director and founder at Institutional Investor Advisory Services, a proxy advisory firm, alluding to the attempt to eject Wadia. Usually, companies do not remove the independent directors unless there are compelling reasons to do so, he added.   Besides Wadia, the seven-member board of Tata Chemicals has three other independent directorsY. S. P. Thorat, Vibha Paul Rishi and Nasser Munjee.It (resolution) is in the interest of all the stakeholders. Discord between the promoter and directors of the operating companies is a recipe for disaster, a Tata group official said on condition of anonymity, before the announcement to the stock exchanges. The move signals that the spat following Mistrys 24 October removal as Tata Sons chairman has entered a new, divisive phase, drawing clear lines between those supporting Ratan Tata, who has become interim chairman, and those backing Mistry. On Thursday, Tata Sons removed Mistry as chairman of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, in which it has a majority stake.In the days following Mistrys ouster from Tata Sons, the two sides have traded bitter accusations. On Thursday, the holding company accused Mistry of betraying the trust it reposed in him when it appointed him chairman in 2012. The Mistry camp said he was fired for going after holy cows in the Tata group.In a separate development, Bhaskar Bhat, a non-executive, non-independent director on the board of Tata Chemicals , resigned. In a letter to Mistry, Bhat said the content in the statement by independent directors dilutes his views expressed in the board meeting.The contents as well as the spirit of the statement completely dilutes the views I expressed at the Board meeting today especially regarding the threat the company faces on account of loss of confidence of the promoter Tata Sons in the chairman of Tata Chemicals Limited. Several important issues of discomfort I expressed seem to have been totally ignored.

-0.13,"Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd, despite a relatively good performance over the past two years, is battling perceptions of under-performance because of its inability to keep pace with its ambitious target of more than doubling its revenue to $20 billion by March 2021.
				   
				This target appears to have done more harm than good: analysts continue to rate the company using it as a metric; and people in the know attribute the departure of at least a few senior executives over the past few years to it. Now, an analyst at a foreign brokerage has suggested that the company is better off without the target.ALSO READ: Has Infosyss recovery dissipated before it even started?Management continues to maintain aspirational revenue and margin targets that are increasingly becoming unlikely to be achieved, in our opinion. Given Infy (Infosys) is now guiding to lower levels of both revenue growth and margins in FY18 (2017-18), we think management would be well-served to either amend or drop its aspirational targets, Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 16 April. Based on its guidance for 2017-18, issued last week, Infosys expects to end the year with revenue of between $10.8 billion and $11.3 billion. Infosys maintains this target is an ambition and the management has no plans to dump it.In April 2015, Infosys first outlined its ambitious target: Indias second largest software firm wanted to become a $20 billion firm with 30% operating margin and to generate $80,000 in revenue from every employee working on a project.  In 2016, it tweaked the deadline to 2020-21. Infosys ended financial year 2015 with $8.7 billion in revenue, 25.9% in operating margin and generated $52,300 per employee.Two years later, Infosys managed a compound annual growth rate of 8.25% to increase its revenue to $10.21 billion but operating margin declined by 120 basis points to 24.7% and revenue per employee slipped to $51,400, making many question CEO Vishal Sikkas strategy.One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Not that Sikka hasnt delivered. Since outlining this target, Sikka steered Infosys to dollar revenue growth of 9.1% in 2015-16 and 7.4% in 2016-17;  for the second consecutive year, Infosys will grow faster than its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and cross-town peer Wipro Ltd (Wipro). Still, Infosys continues to be evaluated on the progress it makes in becoming a $20 billion company. Worryingly for the management, a bigger fallout of the targets has been  the pressure on senior leaders, making a few of them leave. Since April 2015, half-a-dozen executive vice-presidents (EVPs) and a dozen senior vice-presidents (SVPs) have quit. Not all departures are on account of the targets but two former executives admit that they left Infosys as they could not keep up with the impossible targets. The industry is going through a structural change, and to make it worse, you set yourself impossible targets, said a former EVP, who quit last year. A large component of a senior executives salary is tied to companys annual growth, which itself is linked to the long-term target.Infosys says it outlined a target to make its employees work towards a goal and eventually help script a turnaround.We gave this target because we believed this would help motivate employees, and help the CEO make them work towards a goal, one board member, who was part of the goal-setting exercise, said on  condition of anonymity. Looking back, Im still not sure if it was a wrong step. Im still on the fence,  thinking how and what we could have done better to make sure hopes did not run high and employees did not come under pressure.One of the things Infosys could have avoided was linking Sikkas salary to the target, said the second executive who quit, a former SVP. This seemed to suggest that  this was much more than an aspirational target, as the CEO himself has repeatedly said. A weak performance in this year hurt Sikka, who earned $6.8 million in 2016-17, less than the $7.3 million he earned in 2015-16. Sikka got $3.8 million of the promised $8 million performance-related pay, despite a clause in his employment contract that guaranteed him at least 90% of his $11 million salary (including bonuses). It is a general practice for companies to have long-term goals. Wipro, under Abidali Neemuchwala, has outlined an ambition to become $15 billion firm with a 23% margin by March 2020.

0.53,"Mumbai: Cyrus Mistry, the ousted chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, on Sunday rebutted the 10 November statement of the Tata group holding company that alleged Mistry was seeking to control the main group operating firms to the exclusion of Tata Sons and other Tata representatives.
				   
				Tata Sons statement alludes to Mistry having created a new structure where operating companies were drifting away. This is furthest from the truth, said the statement from Mistrys office, while explaining the changes were made to reflect the contextual difference within which the group currently functions.The corporate governance framework in India has considerably tightened in recent times with more stringent rules on the independence of directors, female directors, board evaluation, and so on. To meet this increased scrutiny, several new policies and frameworks were developed at the group centre and deployed across operating companies, said the statement.As such, prior to Mistrys chairmanship, all board members of Tata Sons, with the exception of him, were internal to the group, being either vice-chairmen of group firms or members of the group corporate centre (GCC), said the statement, while pointing out that the structure is exactly the opposite today.According to the statement, the requirement to have 30% Trust nominees and 30% independent directors meant that in addition to Ishaat Hussain and Mistry, there was possibly only one more senior GCC member who could be on board of Tata Sons. This limited the involvement of other group centre members on Tata Sons board, said the note, adding that in the past three years, all these internal members, with the exception of Hussain, had retired. This was a generational change.As agreed with the Tata Sons board, the governance mechanism to protect Tata Sons interests and ensure adequate group representation on operating company boards was to have group executive council (GEC) members, other senior group centre members such as Farokh Subedar and S. Padmanabhan, and select chief executive officers such as Bhaskar Bhat and Noel Tata on the boards of operating firms.In addition, of the nine independent directors on boards of operating firms like Tata Chemicals Ltd and Indian Hotels Co. Ltd which have shown support for the ousted chairman, six were appointed during Ratan Tatas tenure. Moreover, two of these directors also serve as trustees on Tata Trusts.To question the independence of the directors by Tata Sons is truly unfortunate, given that the country acknowledges them as stalwarts of India Inc.

0.36,"Mumbai: Proxy advisory firm InGovern Research Services Pvt. Ltd has recommended the minority shareholders of Tata group companieswhich are holding their EGMs between 13 December and 26 December for the removal of Cyrus P. Mistry as director from the board of the operating companiesto vote against the resolution as Tata Sons Ltd hasnt provided any compelling reasons. 
				   
				Six of the seven Tata-listed group companies where Mistry serves as a director have called for EGMs to replace Mistry as a director after having received requisition from the promoter shareholder Tata Sons. Tata Sons hasnt provided any compelling reasons for the removal of Mistry as a Director from the Boards of the operating companies, said the proxy advisory firm in an email on Thursday morning, while drawing out a case for each of the individual companies and why it recommends minority shareholders to vote against the resolution.Moreover, Tata Sons hasnt articulated any new plans or visions for the operating companies than what the Boards under Mistry had adopted, said InGovern. Also, it is important to note that Mistry continues to have a beneficial shareholding of 3-13% in the listed companies, through 18.4% minority shareholding in Tata Sons Ltd. His presence as a Director on the Boards of the listed companies should be a balance on the Boards and a representation of the minority shareholder. In many operating companies, Cyrus Mistry continues to have the confidence of the Independent Directors, said the advisory. Also read: Ratan Tata asks shareholders to back Mistrys removal from group firmsInGovern also urged shareholders to question inherent assumptions regarding the value of the group structure and the value of Tata brand and demand greater disclosures on information flow between Tata Sons and the operating companies.Minority shareholders should decide on their votes independent of the actions of the promoter shareholder, said the InGovern advisory note, which was the second proxy firm to come out in support of Mistry after Institutional Shareholders Services Inc. (ISS), a foreign proxy advisory firm. So far four advisory firms have issued recommendations which are now equally split for and against.Making a case for the individual companies, InGovern said that in the case of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, which is holding its EGM on 13 December, The promoter itself accepts that the performance of TCS has been good, we do not see any logic as to why a shareholder should vote for removal of a director who was the chairman, for performance issues.The advisory firm further questioned the logic as to why the board had recommended the removal of a director who was given a favourable rating as a chairman a few months back and conceded that the plausible reason is that he was a nominee of Tata Sons on the board of TCS and since he was replaced as chairman for Tata Sons, it is natural that he be removed from the board of TCS. Also read: Cyrus Mistrys office says he is fighting to protect Tata groupAccording to InGovern, Shapoorji Pallonji Group, which is represented by Mistry, has the second largest share in the company after the promoters at 13.47% which means he has skin in the game and hence his interests would be in the best interests of the company. InGovern also discarded the possibility that his presence would cause constant conflict and said that it feels that a board is more effective when everyone is not Yes-men of the promoters on the board. While the Articles of Association of TCS allows the promoter to appoint and replace a chairman without the need to seek prior opinion of the board, we believe such a provision greatly restricts how he powers of the board, said InGovern, which recommended shareholders to raise concerns to remove such provisions from the board. In the case of the Indian Hotels Co. Ltd, which has its EGM on 20 December, all the independent directors have shown support for Mistry and the proxy advisory firm has recommended shareholders to vote against the removal of Mistry from the board as there is no compelling logic, it said. For Tata Steel Ltd, which had its EGM on 21 December, the proxy advisory firm was against the removal of both Mistry and Nusli Wadia as a director. Wadia who had been on the board for 47 years has had a tenure which is far greater than the maximum 10 years for Independent directors, as per Companies Act, 2013. However, Tata Sons proposes his removal not due to his long tenure but because he acted in concert with Mistry. Promoters who remove independent directors who do not agree with their views also sets a bad precedent for Indian corporate governance and such efforts should be thwarted by voting against the promoter proposals, said InGovern. Also read: Cyrus Mistry-Ratan Tata spat: A look at how the events unfoldedIf it is because of the long tenure, then there are at least 10 independent directors across the several group companies, including Aman Mehta of TCS, Deepak Parekh at Indian Hotels, Nasser Munji at Tata Chemicals and Homiar Vaccha at Tata Power Ltd. The proxy advisory firm listed similar reasons to support its recommendations for voting against the removal of Mistry and Wadia in the case of Tata Motors Ltd and Tata Chemicals. It was also against the removal of Mistry from the board of Tata Power, which is holding its EGM on 26 December. The independent directors of Tata Power have not made their positions publicly known even as the other six companies have aired their views. InGovern and ISSs recommendations are in contrast to that of Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS), a Mumbai-based proxy advisory firm. On 30 November, IiAS advised shareholders to vote in favour of Mistrys removal as his continuation on the board may lead to unnecessary friction between the operating companies and Tata Sons. SES, another proxy advisory firm, also recommended voting in favour of Mistrys removal. SES in its analysis has found that the performance of the Company has been agnostic to different persons occupying the post of the Chairman. TCS appears to be a company having matured well settled processes and system and a competent work force and management team. Therefore, removal of Mr. Mistry as a director is not likely to impact performance of the Company. However, as observed in other Tata companies, there is a high probability that continuation of Mr. Mistry might lead to Divided Board which is a value destroyer for sure, the firm said in a 5 December note.",2016-12-08,IjX79ZEzsxCVUmWgQTMDgK,InGovern says Tata Sons hasnt provided any compelling reasons for the removal of Cyrus Mistry as a director from the boards of the operating companies,company,11:19,InGovern tells shareholders to vote against Tata resolution to remove Mistry

-0.12,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) plans to allow market participants to substitute collateral under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) window to give them more flexibility and improve the liquidity of these instruments.
				   
				This facility will be available from 17 April, the regulator said on its website. Under the repo window, banks have to place government bonds as collateral to borrow from the central bank. Separately, the regulator said that it will continue using methods such as open market operations, cash management bills, treasury bills and variable rate repo and reverse repo securities to drain excess liquidity from the system. It also laid out several other regulatory proposals for the banking and financial system. For one, the regulator plans to introduce a new and improved prompt corrective action (PCA) framework for banks with weak balance sheets. Typically, when a bank breaches the lower limit of its capital base during any quarter, along with a build-up of large amount of bad loans and fall in return on assets, RBI initiates this action to limit the banks lending activities and help it fix its affairs. Banks under PCA would be required to conform to mandatory and discretionary actions that the central bank would decide. RBI said the revised framework would be issued by mid-April 2017. Speaking on the asset quality problems in Indian banking after RBIs monetary policy announcement, deputy governor S.S. Mundra said the regulator, and banks in general, are cognizant of the fact that there is no one-size-fits-all approach while attempting resolution of stressed loans. Mundra said that the regulator is considering new measures to deal with bad loans while also tweaking existing stress resolution tools if necessary.The Rs7 trillion bad loan problem in the Indian banking sector is led by public sector banks, which are struggling with recovery and resolution of stress on their books.RBI has also decided to increase the entry barrier for asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) by mandating a net owned funds base of Rs100 crore compared with Rs2 crore earlier. Detailed guidelines in this matter would be released later this month, the regulator has said. Separately, the regulator is also planning on allowing banks to invest in Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs). RBI has also decided to not activate the countercyclical capital buffer as of now, which would have forced banks to set aside a certain portion of their capital as a buffer for difficult times.The central bank plans to introduce steps to improve the national electronic funds transfer (NEFT) infrastructure, rationalize the merchant discount rate (MDR) and issue renewed guidelines on the issuance and operation of prepaid payments instruments (PPIs), it said.RBI said that it is initiating a pilot project on financial literacy at the block level to explore innovative and participatory approaches to financial literacy. A pilot project will be commissioned in nine states across 80 blocks by non-government organizations (NGOs) in collaboration with the sponsor banks. The sponsor banks will enter into contracts with the identified NGOs by 30 June.

This gentleman has stopped attending parties to avoid embarrassment of explaining to his peers why his name is not there.
				   
				In the past one month, since governor Raghuram Rajan made it public that he would not seek a reappointment, both print media and the TV channels are throwing up every possible name as his successor. The scene used to be very different on earlier occasions. Each time a governor was stepping down, only a handful of names would do the rounds as his possible successor. Among the names that appeared more than once was that of Montek Singh Ahluwalia. Lets take a look at the list this time around. I am putting them an alphabetical order to avoid giving an impression that I have a favourite or I think X has a better chance than Y.A: Arundhati Bhattacharya (chairman of State Bank of India), Arvind Panagariya (vice chairman of NITI Aayog, a government of India policy think tank that replaced Planning Commission), Arvind Subramanian (an economist and chief economic adviser to the government of India), Ashok Chawla (former chairman of Competition Commission of India), and Ashok Lahiri (former chief economic adviser to the government).B: Bimal Jalan (who had a stint as RBI governor between 1997 and 2003).J: Jugal Kishore Mohapatra (former rural development secretary).K: Kaushik Basu (former chief economic adviser to the government of India and now chief economist at the World Bank) and K.V. Kamath (head of the New Development Bank of the BRICS countries).P: Parthasarathi Shome (former adviser to Indian finance minister).R: Ratan Wattal (former finance secretary and now a liaison officer with the Jammu & Kashmir government to ensure flow of funds to the state on a fast track), R. Vaidyanathan (a professor at Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore), and Rakesh Mohan (a former RBI deputy governor).S: Shaktikanta Das (economic affairs secretary), Subir Gokarn (former RBI deputy governor and currently an executive director at the International Monetary Fund), and Sumit Bose (former finance secretary).U: U.K. Sinha (chairman of Securities and Exchange Board of India) and Urjit Patel (an RBI deputy governor).V: Vijay Kelkar (former finance secretary) and Vinod Rai (former Comptroller and Auditor General of India and now chairman of Bank Boards Bureau).Even after this, I may have missed a few names and apologize for that. There could be quite a few reasons behind so many names being cited as a possible successor to Rajan.One, many of the newspapers and TV channels indulge in speculation as they love to tell the world I told you so in case one of the many names being mentioned hits the bulls eye.Two, unlike in the past, there is a problem of plenty now and what we are witnessing is a fierce competition among a bunch of talented economists, bureaucrats and bankers for the job of Indias chief money man.Three, since we are relatively better off in terms of macroeconomic parameters, anybody can do this job. Jalan took over in the thick of east Asian crisis; D. Subbarao came in immediately after the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.; and Rajan occupied the seat when inflation was in double digits and the local currency was fast depreciating against the dollar. Now, we have a stable currency, relatively low inflation and low current account deficit.Finally, there could be trial balloons being floated by junior and not-so-junior bureaucrats through news-hungry media to gauge the public sentiment even as former governor Subbaraos tell-all book Who Moved My Interest Rate has queered the pitch for the government. Its a caution to the incumbent on the uneasy relationship that an RBI governor can have with the finance ministry and a message to the ministry that a governor, however close he is to the government before he moves to the central bank, can spill the beans after he is out.The media frenzy to find Rajans successor reminds one of what had happened when Ratan Tata was retiring as chairman of Tata Sons. The long list, published over months, had many names from India and overseas but not Cyrus P. Mistry who actually succeeded him when Tata retired in December 2012. No one will be surprised if a dark horse emerges from nowhere for the governors post.Whoever comes may not have an easy job at hand. In the past one month, since Rajan announced his decision to go back to the academic world, the level of rupee has remained unchanged but the 10-year government bond yield has dropped from 7.5% to 7.27% and most bank stocks have risen, some of them substantially. Bankex, the representative industry index on BSE, has risen 7.3%. Out of 39 listed banks, only five stocks have fallenthree of them are associates of the State Bank of India, besides Central Bank of India and Punjab & Sind Bank. Among public sector banks, Punjab National Bank has risen close to 44%, Allahabad Bank 36% and Indian Bank and Canara Bank, more than 25% each. Overall, 13 state-owned banks and six private banks have risen at least 10% and as much as 44% in past one month.Clearly, the market is factoring in two thingsin the new regime, interest rate will fall and the pressure on the banks to clean up their balance sheets will be diluted. And, of course, the government will continue to infuse capital in the state-owned banks without any conditions even as the brainstorming on bank consolidation to create a few large banks will continue for years without any solution in sight.

-0.58,"San Francisco: Tracy Chou wrote a post on Medium in October 2013, challenging tech companies to tell the world what percentage of their software engineers were women. Surprisingly, it worked: Google, Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and others published their lopsided race and gender statistics, and Chou, then a Pinterest software engineer, became a face of the tech diversity movement. 
				   
				Pinterest positioned itself as a company working hard to hire more women as well as black and Latino workers. In 2015, the company made an unprecedented move: it published a set of diversity-focused hiring goals. It would strive to make 30% of its engineering hires women, and it would report on its progress in a year.Sixteen months later, Pinterest retreated. Despite all its efforts, only 22% of its new engineers were women, and in response, the company lowered its goal for next year from 30% to 25%. It had hit and exceeded its targets in two other categoriesmaking 8% of its engineering hires under-represented ethnic minorities, for example. Pinterest said it missed its women in engineering goal because it focused on hiring more senior women, which takes longer. But its admission that it had missed its mark and would lower expectations was a disappointment. Obviously we were all hoping it would be better and closer to 30%, said Chou, who left the company in June. Pinterests head of diversity, Candice Morgan, said the company sets goals that are challenging and that it thinks it has a 70% chance of reaching.ALSO READ | Why India needs more working womenPinterests big goaland its later retrenchmentshow how tech companies diversity ambitions can come with their own set of messes and challenges. In the two years since tech giants first revealed how most of their employees were white and Asian men, their diversity has only increased a few percentage points  or, in some cases, dropped. Most companies first response was to try to make their hiring processes more blind: stripping resumes of names and pictures, for example, to keep out information that might unintentionally bias an interviewer for or against a candidate.Now, some companies want to do more than cover their eyes. Its not enough to just publish demographic data and scrub names and pictures from resumes. Unlike other companies, Twitter and Pinterest set specific hiring goals. Facebook rewarded its recruiters extra for diversity hires. Microsoft is tying managers bonuses to their diversity hiring after the proportion of female workers fell for two consecutive years. Even small startups  like Penny, a four-person personal finance company in San Francisco thats the subject of the latest episode of Bloombergs Decrypted podcast  are evaluating candidates on whether they bring a new perspective to the team, in addition to their technical skills. Some companies are embracing affirmative action hiring, even if they are careful to call it something else.I have quite a few clients saying, We want to take it one step further, or saying, Listen, we did the unconscious bias thing, and we didnt get a lot out of it, said Y-Vonne Hutchinson, a diversity consultant who works with startups and helped found Project Include, a group of diversity advocates who publish guides of best practices for companies. Its happening in a way that wasnt happening last year.Hutchinson encourages companies to explore new tactics, but she also warns them to prepare for resistance. Affirmative action gets a lot of blowback, but it was one of the most successful ways of getting people from under-represented groups into jobs and institutions they were excluded from, Hutchinson said. Shes African-American, and she said affirmative action helped her mother get a federal government job. I dont think tech has embraced affirmative action because theyre really married to the idea of a meritocracy.ALSO READ | The HR trends of 2017Instead of calling it affirmative action, companies are looking for a policy that looks like that, talks like that, but isnt perceived as that, Hutchinson said. Companies want to discuss equal opportunity without the terms quotas and affirmative action, she said.Should tech companies ignore a candidates background when deciding whether to hire themor should they factor it in? The debate is ongoing, said Chou, who is also part of Project Include. (She said she left Pinterest not out of disappointment, but because she wanted to try something new.)Itd be cleaner and easier if making the hiring process blind suddenly led to more women and minorities being hired, but thats often insufficient, Chou said. Active policies to promote diversity, on the other hand, can strike some job candidates as unjust. People feel its an unfair judgment on them if they get turned down and someone they feel is objectively less than them in some way is hired, she said.At Pinterest, the pressure of reporting public hiring goals could be felt inside the company. That internal conversationWere not going to hit this, and its going to look really bad if we dontmade people haul ass and get their shit together, Chou said. Morgan, Pinterests head of diversity, wrote in an email: Setting public goals focused and encouraged the team to have more authentic conversations and learn more about how to make meaningful progress ... Theyve resulted in the most diverse team Pinterest has had to date.Pinterest asked some of its employees to recommend a certain number of candidates from under-represented groups for jobs at Pinterest, and some workers felt those goals were unfairly distributed, Chou said. Some employees pushed back when they were encouraged to refer the same number of people as a larger team and asked if the referrals should be prorated, she said. It was a little frustrating to hear the grumblings but also not that surprising, as people tend to grumble about any extra work that theyre asked to do, Chou said. Morgan said the company later tailored its requests based on feedback from engineering leaders.At Facebook, recruiters in 2015 were told to prioritize finding diversity candidatesengineers that werent white or Asian men, according to former recruiters who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to talk about their work. After a few months, the recruiters became frustrated, because they said most of their minority engineering candidates didnt end up getting an offer. From 2015 to 2016, the number of women in technology roles at Facebook increased 1 %, and its proportion of black and Latino workers stayed flat. Two former recruiters blamed the engineering departments hiring process, which gave veto power to a small group of engineering leaders that signed off on every offer. Though Facebook pushed recruiters to look for diversity, those making hiring decisions were not held accountable to those same goals, according to the former recruiters.Even when the hires are made, other employees may grow resentful. GitHub, a site where coders can store and share their work, hired consultant Nicole Sanchez in 2015 to create and lead its Social Impact team, which focuses on improving diversity efforts. The team is now 11 out of the companys 600 employees, and it pushed strongly for more diversity among the people who interviewed job seekers, the company said.Some employees groused. Two former GitHub employees said the Social Impact team would question hiring practices and choices and ruled with a heavy hand. The former employees, who declined to be identified out of fear of reprisal from the company, also alleged that GitHub sometimes missed out on the best talent by focusing too much on a candidates background. A GitHub spokeswoman declined to comment.When tech companies talk about hiring, they often talk about bringing in the best person possible and ignoring everything else. For many, best has meant the person whos most technically skilled or who will be shipping code the soonest after they start.But some are redefining best to factor in diversity. At Penny, which builds a chatbot that texts users analysis and advice about their spending, chief executive officer (CEO) Mitchell Lee wanted the companys fifth hire to add diversity to the team. He spent the fall looking for candidates who were different from the four men who already worked there  affirmative action hiring, in his own words.ALSO READ: Snapchat picks London for its international headquartersWhen I say affirmative action, I mean I want to be able to see someones picture, Lee said. If asked to choose between two hypothetical candidates who are equally qualified for a job at Penny, then he rejects the premise as false: Those two people are not equally qualified. Somebody with a diverse background and a totally different perspective is more qualified for the position were trying to fill, which is expanding upon the collective viewpoint of what Penny has, he said.Lee found that some candidates were dropping out of the interview process along the way, and they were often those he was particularly interested in  women or people with unusual backgrounds. He started checking in with those candidates more frequently, encouraging them along the way. It helped. But he said it showed him how much more was needed beyond getting diverse candidates in the mix: He needed to earn the trust of many of them. Its really hard to convey, especially if youre like me and youre a white guy in his mid-twenties trying to tell candidates that diversity is something you care about, he said.In December, after several months of searchingLee estimates he looked through hundreds of candidatesPenny hired a fifth person, Vertika Srivastava, an Indian-American woman who went to the University of Michigan and worked as a software developer at Accenture. The four current employees are excited for her to start. But Lee and the other Penny workersthey all had a saywaffled when deciding whether to give her an offer. Pennys developers code mostly in Ruby, a programming language Srivastava doesnt have much experience in.At one point during the interview process, Srivastava asked the four Penny guys why they were interested in her. They listed some aspects of her personality, and they were blunt: It was also because shes a woman. I liked that they didnt tiptoe around that, she said. She starts this week.Pennys approach is different than that of most companies. Pinterest and Twitter dont talk about quotas; they talk about hiring goals. Stacy Brown-Philpot, the African-American CEO of TaskRabbit, an on-demand job platform, has pledged to make the companys workforce represent the ethnic and racial makeup of the country. She said on stage at a conference in October that in order to get there, the company will need to over-index on certain groups, though she followed that up with: I dont know if I would say its affirmative action.Slack, a $3.8 billion workplace chat service startup, practices intentional hiring, said Leslie Miley, its director of engineering and a diversity advocate. The company actively looks for people outside of the standard 20 schools and six companies, he said, and they value what historically hasnt been valued in Silicon Valley. That means measuring people by distance travelledhow far theyve come in life instead of just looking for a Stanford computer science degree. Miley said that candidates who would score higher on this metric could include those who were the first in their family to go to college, or are veterans, or went to community college.But Miley dislikes the term affirmative action. The amount of baggage attached to that term is horrid, he said. When you say affirmative action, the very next question most people have is, Are we going to lower the bar? So lets not call it that. Lets call it hiring the way hiring always should have been. What I want is a level playing field. Bloomberg",2017-01-10,KBcVjMqer3e46kpPzpRv6I,"Maintaining diversity among employees, yet hiring the best is the next challenge facing the Silicon Valley employers",competitor,19:39,Some tech companies are trying affirmative action hiring

She co-founded Pratham Books, a non-profit publishing enterprise to produce high-quality, low-cost books for children in several Indian languages. Nilekani has been involved in development issues for several years. In an interview, she sp aks about how the wealthy can be persuaded to give more to charity, why access to natural resources is important for improving lives and the India Philanthropy Initiative. Edited excerpts from the interview conducted by Bridgespan in partnership with Mint: 
One of the under-reported elements in the new strategic philanthropy era is the element of personal reward and the joy that comes from philanthropy. What do you consider to be your most rewarding philanthropic experiences recently?Yes, you are absolutely right that our brains are wired for altruism and what keeps altruism going in the human race is the actual joy you get out of it. You have to watch out that it doesnt turn into a sort of ego-driven joy. But when I meet children reading the books we published at Pratham Books, it gives me the most undiluted joy. But also at a more fundamental level, being able to work with communities to improve their water resources and then to see what a difference it makes, especially to the lives of women. We have helped with spring restoration, for example, and when communities are able to get sustainable, safe water, thats been a deep fundamental satisfaction as well. Can you give an example or idea where philanthropy can change the power structure?One of the great conundrums in philanthropy globally is that the way wealth creation happens itself often creates the inequities in society. In the ideal world, philanthropy should be redundant or at least it should be at the edges, as innovation or risk capital. But its far from an ideal world; the wealthy are cornering more and more opportunities and resources from this planet. So, the big challenge for philanthropy iscan it engage with the distribution of wealth itself? It is very difficult, let me tell you. Once you are wealthy, you are in a nice comfort zone and want to stay there. So I always look in the mirror and ask, is my philanthropy making the world a more just and fair place? Take the water example; because when people dont have access to water, its very hard to have good health, good income and livelihoods, so I think the work on water is about restructuring power. So also with some of the other work that I do on ecology, I think peoples access to the natural resource base really does make a difference in how they can bootstrap themselves up to a better life.What can be done or needs to be done to stimulate the newly wealthy in India? I think those who are already in philanthropy and enjoying it and making a difference have a responsibility to share their stories widely, and to be very transparent about their giving. That is very necessary in India today. There also needs to be public pressure on the wealthy, and government policy should make it easier to give. The regulatory cholesterol around setting up charitable organizations can be cleaned up. I think enabling non-profits, which are essentially the absorptive pipeline for philanthropy, is critical. And right now there is distrust between government and NGOs (non-governmental organizations), which I think is not healthy. So we do need government and NGOs to sit at the table and say how can we make the NGO sector more transparent? How can we then have less regulation and make it easier to function? I think all this will help to increase philanthropy in India.Can you talk a little bit about the role of big bets in India? Is there a need for more strategic action?I think we have seen international philanthropists take these audacious big bets and obviously the (Bill and Melinda) Gates Foundation comes to my mind, when they deploy their capital to crack some vaccine or child mortality. I mean that sounds like the kind of areas we used to leave to God or at least to the big state! But it is wonderful that people who have become so incredibly wealthy are now putting their intellectual capital along with their monetary capital to say, why cant we just be audacious and crack things that have just not cracked for so long? It has its risks; it always has its risks when individuals use their power and wealth to solve something because unless it comes with a set of checks and balances in society, sometimes you can also go very wrong. But I am all for these big bets and in India I dont think we have taken enough of them. I hope we mature to that.You are involved with other philanthropists in establishing and leading Indian philanthropic initiatives...The India Philanthropy Initiative was set up by a few of us under Azim Premjis leadership. We have decided to take it slowly but the goal is to see how we can inspire much more philanthropy in India. We are learning to see if we can be effective as a group of philanthropists, pushing each others limit. And we are best as a peer-to-peer network where we can freely ask questions and learn.ALSO READ | You really want to be doing things that make a difference: Ratan TataDo you think the expression and experience of philanthropy in India can be distinctive?It can be made distinctive. If we really get back into the roots of our culture and philosophy, we can bring that out into the modern era by infusing it with new meaning about responsibility in society. And you can make it as spiritual as you want it to be or make it just about creating a better democracy. So yes, there is potential to infuse Indian philanthropy with a deeply culturally rooted new meaning. And that is a journey worth taking I think.ALSO READ | Being positive is not a curseALSO READ | Growth of wealth gives way for growth in charityThe Bridgespan Group, an adviser and resource for mission-driven leaders and organizations, in partnership with Mint interviewed several philanthropists across India to trace their journeys and share their learningsConversations with Remarkable Givers: India.

-0.61,"Mumbai: For Grishma, an Indian software designer, President Donald Trumps review of the visa programme for bringing highly skilled workers into the United States comes at a bad time.
				   
				Fresh from gaining a masters degree in Europe, and with an offer of employment from a well-known US design firm, she was well on her way to fulfilling the ambition of many young Indian IT workersa dream job in America.But as she waits in the H1B visa queue for the green light, she is caught in a bind. Its a weird time to be applying, with all the scrutiny, said Grishma, who gave only her first name for fear of jeopardising her chances of getting a visa.The United States has already suspended the expedited processing option for applicants, under which she may have received a visa in weeks. More broadly, uncertainty over the review announced this week has unsettled Grishma and many others like her.She will have to wait until at least around August to learn her fate, but having accepted the US job offer she is not in a position to apply for positions elsewhere, including in Europe. Its pretty debilitating, Grishma told Reuters. Id like to start work to mitigate the financial damage.Trumps decision was not a huge surprise, given his election campaign pledge to put American jobs first.Also read: H-1B visa curbsIndia talks tough, signals it may hit back at USBut the executive order he signed, though vague in many areas, has prompted thousands of foreign workers already in the United States or applying for visas to work there to re-think their plans. Companies who send them also face huge uncertainty.The concerns are particularly acute in India, where IT firms like Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd are top beneficiaries of the H1B visa programme, using it to send computer engineers to service clients in the United States, their largest overseas market.Companies and staff realignExperts say Trumps order to review visa processes is aimed at firms like TCS, Infosys and Wipro, which from 2005-14 snagged around 86,000 H1B visas, roughly equivalent to the number of H1B visas the United States issues in total each year.Two industry people aware of the matter said Infosys, Indias no. 2 information technology (IT) services company, is applying for just under 1,000 H1B visas this year, which one of the people said was down from 6,500 applications in 2016 and some 9,000 in 2015.It was not clear whether the sharp reduction in 2017 was in direct response to Trumps presidency, although the company has said for some time it wanted to cut dependence on fly-in staff. TCS, Infosys and Wipro said they would not share data on the number of H1B visas they had applied for this year.With fewer visas going to Infosys, more might become available for smaller IT companies and big US tech companies, like Facebook and Microsoft Corp, that typically send in fewer H1B applications each year.US-based immigration lawyer Murali Bashyam, managing partner of Bashyam Spiro LLP which advises and works with small to mid-sized Indian IT firms, said clients had been in contact seeking clarity, while the number of visa applicants had fallen.I think the reason for that is they get the sense that its going to get so much tougher to comply with all of the changes ... that it might not be worth their money, he said. There is a fear that radical immigration changes are coming, and if those radical immigration changes come then it could completely change the way IT staffing companies do business.Bashyam said the number of people on H1B visas already working in the United States who were considering returning to their home country had risen.An engineer working at Cisco, who has been in the United States since 2011, said that three months ago he would not have considered returning to India. But the review of the visa system, and any rule change that revoked the right for his wife to work in the United States on a dependent visa, could force him to change his mind.If that happens, then I would definitely be interested in going back to India. Even though Im secure, I dont want to be in a situation where my wife cannot work, said the engineer, who declined to be named. Those who have heavily invested here, whove bought houses, property and are still on visas, are afraid.Im looking eastwardAccording to Bashyam, some Indians on H1B visas were cancelling plans to return home to visit their families in case they had problems getting back into the United States. With everything thats going on, travelling outside the US is the biggest fear for a lot of the H1B workers working in the IT staffing industry, he said.And the uncertainty is not limited to IT. Trumps campaign rhetoric around tighter visa rules has led some Indian students considering studying abroad to look beyond the United States, which typically draws in over 1,00,000 Indian students annually.One Canadian official said the number of student visa applications for certain courses in Canada had spiked over 250% since Trumps election win in November.Akshay Baliga, a management consultant with a H1B visa that is valid until 2018, said he was not considering returning to the United States for work any time soon. As a professional Im looking eastward, said Baliga, now based in India but who earlier studied and lived for years in America.

-0.35,"At first glance, the letter from the Delhi police commissioners desk could have easily been dismissed as  another routine laundry list of his departments achievements in the previous year.
				   
				A closer look at the letter, written a little over two years ago, would have sprung a pleasant surprise in the context of the city polices technology prowess.The Delhi Police, according to the letter, had partnered with the Indian Space Research Organisation to implement CMAPSCrime Mapping, Analytics and Predictive Systemunder the Effective use of Space Technology-based Tools for Internal Security Scheme initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014.CMAPS generates crime-reporting queries and has the capacity to identify crime hotspots by auto sweep on the Dial 100 database every 1-3 minutes, replacing a Delhi Police crime-mapping tool that involved manual gathering of data every 15 days. It performs trend analysis, compiles crime and criminal profiles and analyses the behaviour of suspected offendersall with accompanying graphics. CMAPs also has a security module for VIP threat rating, based on vulnerability of the potential target and the security deployed, and advanced predictive analysis, among other features.A prototype of the standalone version was installed at the Delhi Police control room in June 2015. The softwares statistical models and algorithms today help the police carry out predictive policing to forecast where the next crime is likely to occur, much like in cities such as London, Los Angeles, Kent and Berlin.Thats just one example of how technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily liveswhether its policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains.Fintech start-up Lendingkart Technologies has developed tools based on big data analytics to help lenders evaluate borrowers creditworthiness. Using these tools, its sister company Lendingkart Finance Ltd aims to transform small business lending by providing easy access to credit for small and medium enterprises.The technology platform has helped create a highly operational efficiency model that enables swift loan disbursement within 72 hours of loan application. Over 120,000 SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) have till date reached out to Lendingkart Finance for their credit needs, the company said.Accenture Labs and Akshaya Patra, the worlds largest NGO-run midday meal programme, said on Thursday that they had partnered in a project to exponentially increase the number of meals served to children in schools in India that are run and aided by the government.Using disruptive technology, they hope to potentially improve efficiency by 20%, which could boost the number of meals served by millions.Accenture Labs began the project with a strategic assessment and design thinking, then developed a prototype for improving kitchen operations and outcomes. An example of Akshaya Patras transformation, according to Thursdays statement, was its move from manual collection of feedback from children and schools to a more efficient technology-based solution that involved the use of blockchain (the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin) and sensor-enabled devices to gather feedback digitally, and use artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to predict the next days meal requirements. Consider another example. Until even early 2015, the thousands of distributors of consumer goods firm Marico Ltd in Mumbai used to place orders and wait almost a day before getting the goods delivered. Now it takes just 10-15 minutes for an order to be delivered, helping them stock fewer goods. In turn, the lower inventory helps them cut down on warehouse space and pare costs, besides reducing the waiting time for trucks. All these distributors have benefited from an analytics-driven Order Management Execution System that the company launched in December 2014.Big Data and the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) are intimately connected: billions of Internet-connected things will, by definition, generate massive amounts of data. By 2020, the world would have generated around 40 zettabytes of data, or 5,127 gigabytes per individual, according to an estimate by research firm International Data Corp. Its no wonder that in 2006, market researcher Clive Humby declared data to be the new oil. Companies are sharpening their focus on analysing this deluge of data to understand consumer behaviour patterns. A report by software body Nasscom and Blueocean Market Intelligence, a global analytics and insight provider, predicts that the Indian analytics market will cross the $2 billion mark by this fiscal year.Companies are using Big Data analytics for everythingdriving growth, reducing costs, improving operations and recruiting better people.A major portion of orders of e-commerce firms now come through their analytics-driven systems. These firms record the purchasing behaviour of buyers and customize things for them. Travel firms, on their part, use data analytics to understand their customersfrom basic things like their travel patterns, the kind of hotels they like to stay in, who their typical co-travellers are, their experiencesall geared to giving the customer a personalized experience the next time the customer visits the website.In hospitals, intelligence derived from data helps improve patient care through quicker and more accurate diagnoses, drug dosage recommendations and the prediction of potential side effects. Millions of electronic medical records, public health data and claims records are being analysed.Predictive healthcare using wearables to check vital medical signs and remote diagnostics could cut patient waiting times, according to a 13 January report by the McKinsey Global Institute. International Business Machines Corp.s Watson, a cluster of computers that combines artificial intelligence and advanced analytics software and works as a question answering system, is being used for a variety of applications, most notably in oncology, the branch of medicine that deals with cancer. Watson for Oncology helps physicians quickly identify key information in a patients medical records, sift through tons of data and come up with most optimal medical choices.Many companies globally and in India, including some start-ups, are using machine-learning tools to infuse intelligence in their business by using predictive models. Popular machine-learning applications include Googles self-driving car, online recommendations from e-commerce companies such as Amazon and Flipkart, online dating service Tinder and streaming video platform Netflix. Railigent, Siemens AGs platform for the predictive maintenance for trains, listens to the trains running over its sensors and can detect, from the sound of the wheels, which wheel is broken and when it should be replaced.Predictive algorithms are used in recruitment too. Aspiring Minds, for instance, uses algorithms powered by machine learning that draw on data to address complex issuesfor instance, to accurately gauge the quality of speech in various accents against a neutral accent (also using natural language processing). This helps companies improve recruitment efficiency by over 35% and reduce voice evaluation costs by 55%.Artificial intelligence, machine-learning-based algorithms and anomaly-detection techniques will need to be used to monitor activity across networks and real-time data streams, consulting firms point out. These technologies will, for instance, let banks in India identify threats as they occur while maintaining low false positive alarm rates even for new types of threats.There are still challenges in bringing about wider technology adoption.Our survey showed that only about 4% of companies across industries have the capabilities to use advanced data analytics to deliver tangible business value. While some oil and gas companies have invested in their analytics capabilities, many struggle to get their arms around this powerful new opportunity, said a March 2014 note by Bain and Co..We often find that senior executives understand the concepts around Big Data and advanced analytics, but their teams have difficulty defining the path to value creation and the implications for technology strategy, operating model and organization. Too often, companies delegate the task of capturing value from better analytics to the IT department, as a technology project, the note pointed out.In the 2006 movie Deja Vu, law enforcement agents investigate an explosion on a ferry that kills over 500 people, including a large group of party-going sailors. They use a new program that uses satellite technology to look back in time for four-and-a-half daysto try to capture the terrorist.Predictive policing is surely not as advanced today. And advances in predictive analytics can certainly raise ethical issues. For instance, the police may in the future be able to predict who might become a serial offender, and make an intervention at an early stage to change the path followed by the person, as is the case in Deja Vu. Or an insurance firm may use predictions to increase the premium or even deny a user an insurance.Any disruptive technology needs checks and balances in the form of good policy if it is to deliver to its potential.",2017-04-21,KUE7JGODJlGgYdmQ2VX5KM,"Technology is playing a ubiquitous role in our daily liveswhether its policing a city, speeding up financial transactions or transforming supply chains",competitor,01:12,Making predictions with Big Data

So, whatever quantity is available, we are procuring that from vegetable oil manufacturers via tenders, said an official of Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL), requesting anonymity.

Ltd (HPCL) plan to buy a total of 20 million litres of biodiesel from local manufacturers, a BPCL official said, requesting anonymity. Introducing more biodiesel will help India, which imports 80% of its crude oil, to reduce its oil import bill.The country is targeting a more than seven-fold expansion in its biofuel market in the next six years, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan had said on 10 August.Blending 5% of biodiesel with diesel and 10% ethanol with petrol can expand the biofuel market to Rs50,000 crore by 2022 from about Rs6,500 crore currently. For this, India would need 6.75 billion litres of biodiesel and 4.5 billion liters of ethanol, Pradhan had said.We are looking at sourcing more biodiesel to meet 10% blending norm, the BPCL official cited above said.

				The trigger is perhaps the strong indication of a better year for retail air conditioner sales.This segment accounts for half the revenue clocked in its domestic operations. Dealers say sales in January were better than what it was last year, and discounts were lower, too.A recent report by Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd says that in a recent exhibition on heating, ventilating and air conditioning, manufacturers were showcasing new products or energy-efficient variants, optimistic of good sales in the coming summer.Last years inventory pile-up, due to a less severe summer, had been drawn down during the October-November festive season.Meanwhile, the sales of larger commercial air conditioners used by hotels, retail stores, educational institutions and offices are hotting up, too. Together, the segment, which is called the unitary cooling products (UCP) division, has shown decent growth. Voltass market share rose by about 300 basis points  over the last two years. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Unfortunately, the companys engineering and electro-mechanical projects (EMP) businesses have been the spoilers for some quarters in the recent past. Voltas significant presence in the international markets, especially in the Gulf, marred performance due to delays in project execution and payments. The EMP segment even posted a loss in the December quarter, faring worse than the Streets expectation. Add to this weak order inflows: a situation that is unlikely to change in the near term with the low oil price raising concerns regarding capex in these regions.On home ground, too, it may be a while before large industrial and infrastructure orders pick up. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) for January declined more than anticipated, led by weakness in manufacturing. Like most companies in the capital goods pack, Voltas, too, will see gains in the last leg of the capex cycle, as that is when its products are installed.But, on the whole, theres a spark of investor confidence in the firm on account of improving sales in the UCP business.

Infosys has not disclosed the annual targets upon completion of which Sikka stands to get full variable salary.Also read: Infosys compensation row: Of executives, programmers and fairnessAccording to his employment contract, Sikka, if need be, can use a so-called good reason clause to terminate his existing employment agreement with Infosys, if his annual compensation of $11 million falls by more than 10%.Effectively, what this means is that Infosys is beholden to pay him at least $10 million if it wants to retain him as CEO.To be sure, he can choose not to use the clausewhich means he can, if he wants to, accept a $3 million salarybut the existence of this clause does put him on a strong footing. Good reason, in the employment contract, is defined as Executives resignation within 30 days... following the occurrence of one or more of the following, without executives express written consent: a material reduction (with 10% reduction deemed to be material) in executives aggregate target compensation comprised of base pay, target variable pay and target value of stock compensation (except, where there is a substantially similar reduction applicable to senior executives generally, provided that such reduction does not exceed 10%).Also read: Forget compassionate capitalism, just some fairness will doInfosys filed a copy of this employment agreement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on 18 May last year. By then, shareholders had already given their nod to Sikkas higher compensation, making at least one proxy advisory firm question whether Infosys deliberately did not share complete information.In light of the fact that there is asymmetry of information in the information provided in the notice that was sent to Indian shareholders when an approval was sought and in the SEC disclosure, this is bad corporate governance, said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of proxy firm InGovern Research.An Infosys spokesperson said the clause was also part of an earlier agreement with Sikka that was filed with the SEC on 20 May 2015.Your interpretation of the clause in the CEOs contract is completely wrong, the spokesperson said in response to emailed queries from Mint if Sikkas minimum salary is $10 million on account of the good reason clause. The spokesperson refused to elaborate. We have publicly addressed questions on the CEOs contract and we stand by that, the spokesperson said. The spokesperson maintained that Sikkas salary was variable. As stated before, the nominations and remuneration committee (NRC) will evaluate the CEOs variable compensation at the end of the fiscal year based on the companys performance. Dr. Sikkas compensation is linked to the companys aspirational goal to achieve $20 billion in revenues by March 2021, the spokesperson added.A lack of clarity on Sikkas $11 million salary was one reason for the souring of the relationship between the founder-promoters, led by N.R. Narayana Murthy, and the companys board, Mint reported on 10 February.A majority of the promoters also did not vote for a resolution seeking a salary increase for chief operating officer U.B. Pravin Rao. According to filings by Infosys with stock exchanges, only 24% of promoter votes were cast in favour of the resolution seeking a 35% raise in Raos compensation to Rs12.5 crore. The remaining abstained. On Sunday, in response to a questionnaire from Mint, Murthy said  that the promoters believe the pay increase was not proper as the increase is a lot higher than what was awarded to rank-and-file employees. Every senior management person of an Indian corporation has to show self-restraint in his or her compensation. This is necessary if we have to make compassionate capitalism acceptable to a majority of Indians who are poor, said Murthy in an email.

				The present business model of Indian IT companiesoffshore-onsite work ratio of 70:30 would now go up to 90:10, the former chief financial officer of Infosys said. So, what will happen is they (Indian IT firms) will offshore more work and increase their competitiveness. They will do only 10% work onsite, and 90% offshore, Pai told PTI. It can be done very easily for 70-80% of the business. It will improve their competitiveness and make them better, he said. The new H1B regulations are very good for Indian IT, and bad for companies which try to use it for cheap labour. First of all, Indian IT is not cheap because what they bill to clients is $125,000 to $150,000 per year (for an onsite employee), he said. The average pay is around $80,000-85,000 per year. They are unnecessarily getting a bad name, because some fly-by-night operators are trying to do body-shopping and spoil the name of the entire (Indian IT) industry, he said. The new regulations would play to the strength Indian IT companies because they have been reducing the number of H1B visas they collected since 2014, he said. So, they are already getting prepared. It will increase the billing because it will create artificial scarcity in America, and allow Indian companies to bill more for work because there are not enough Americans to fill the positions that are needed, said Pai, who is chairman of Manipal Global Education Services and Aarin Capital. Its a blessing in disguise, I dont think they need to be scared or anything, he said. As for possible downsides on the visa front, Pai said there would be some uncertainties for the next six months because nobody knows what they (US Labour department) are going to do and how they are going to behave and all that. Uncertainty is because the US Labour Department is threatening more inspections. They will find out the number of applications (by Indian IT firms for H1B visas) have come down and they should be happy, Pai said.

While revenue was more or less in line with expectations, new order bookings fell below expectations, and so did the companys outlook for the consulting business. Accentures shares have fallen by around 4% since the results were announced last week. 
				   
				Some analysts have cheered the relatively higher growth in the companys outsourcing business, suggesting this augurs well for Indias IT services industry. Outsourcing services grew 8% in constant currency terms last quarter, compared to 5% growth in consulting services. This is the first time in two years that Accentures outsourcing segment has outgrown its consulting practice. But as analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd point out, (The outsourcing segment) is largely market share gain-driven and cannot be read positively from an Indian IT perspective, in our view. In other words, the pickup in Accentures outsourcing business may well be coming at the expense of Indian IT, with which it competes directly. Worse still, the analysts add that the heightening of immigration fears could put the multinational firm in an advantageous position in this segment versus Indian IT, which is far more dependent on H-1B visas. Not very long ago, Indian investors were celebrating the fact that Tata Consultancy Services Ltds (TCSs) market capitalization exceeded the combined value of Accenture and Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Now, Accentures value exceeds that of TCS by around $5.5 billion. Note that Accentures new order bookings fell by 4% year-on-year and were below expectations. Growth in the key North American region fell to 4%, compared to double-digit growth a year ago. Company-wide growth has more-or-less halved in the past one year. These arent comforting signs for Indian IT, by any stretch of imagination. Some analysts see the relatively higher growth in Accentures outsourcing business as a positive for Indian IT, since it points to a shift in the nature of digital spends by customers, which may provide more opportunities for Indian companies. The argument goes that digital has moved beyond the consulting phase and is now scaling up, where Indian ITs capabilities will be required. It would be prudent for investors to look for more datapoints that attest this. For now, whats working in the favour of IT stocks is that since valuations are low when compared to the broad market, they have takers when stocks fall below a certain threshold.

-0.44,"Bengaluru: Back in 2008, 25-year-old Rohan Murty embarked on an unusual road trip. He travelled to various US cities around the Washington, DC metro area on his own, often walking for miles from one city to another. It was far from a thrill-seeking adventurehe was a man on a mission. Murty drove more than a thousand miles through forests and in the middle of nowhere.
				   
				Using a technology system he had built at Harvard Universitywhere he was at the time pursuing his PhD in computer scienceMurty was attempting to measure the actual usage of licensed and unlicensed spectrumwhich is typically used by telecom companies, TV and radio stations, as well as for technology such as Wi-Fi. He stopped every few miles, in order to validate the correctness of his research and the software he had built. What he found out during that study would lay the basis for his research into technology that is referred to as White Space Network or White-Fi. In laymans terms, White-Fi refers to unutilized television broadcast frequencies or white spaces that are potentially capable of delivering low-cost Internet connectivity to rural and remote parts of a country. What I found out during that trip was that spectrum in general is severely underutilized, says Murty. Murty jokingly recalls that at one point, he was even stopped by a state police officer, who wondered why some scrawny, brown kid was walking around suspiciously with an unusual technical device on a US highway. A vocal proponent of White-Fiwhich he believes has the potential to deliver affordable Internet connectivity to hundreds of millions of Indians across the remotest parts of the countryMurty is of the view that the Indian government needs to make a stronger push for White-Fi and does not agree with the current stand of top telcos such as Airtel and Vodafone, which have so far opposed the use of white spaces. Companies like Microsoft have also in recent months urged the government to fight for White-Fi and oppose the telecom lobby, citing the examples of countries like the US and UK where unlicensed spectrum usage has been permitted. In an interview, Murty, son of Infosys Ltd founder N.R. Narayana Murthy and a junior fellow at the Society of Fellows at Harvard University, spoke primarily on his research on White-Fi, how his work focused on architecture for dynamic spectrum access in wireless networks and other work that he is doing on the sidelines. Aside from helping manage investments for the Murthy family office, Catamaran Ventures, he has also made some angel investments under the radarincluding a small investment in Bengaluru-based start-up Floh, which is a singles network that helps urban and educated singles find life partners. Edited excerpts:What do you make of current debates around spectrum usage in India? The telcos have so far fiercely opposed the use of white spaces and unlicensed spectrum...Let me zoom back a little. Historically weve always thought of spectrum as a binary sort of thingeither somebody has exclusive access to it or nobody has exclusive access to it. So, its either licensed or unlicensed. Example of licensed, is TV, radio, cellphone companies, etc. Wi-Fi is an example of unlicensed spectrum, its the technology that Wi-Fi operates overthats one example. Wi-Fi is just a piece of technology though, not a piece of spectrum. Now, lets take an examplelets say you have a wire between your computer and the Internet. And you pump data through. Think of the wire as a pipe and data as water. The more volume of water you pump, the more data you are pumping through. But there is a limit before the pipe explodes, in some sense. So, what do you do when the pipe saturates? All you have to do is instal one more pipeor in this case, one more wire. So, in some sense you can have infinite bandwidthbecause you just keep installing more wires. And that works. But when you move to the wireless world, this is not the right analogy. The wireless world is like a highwaythe width is fixed, you cant increase the width at all. That is a limitation of nature. So, the capacity of a wireless world is boundthere is a maximum you can extract out of it. So, now you have these lanes on the highwaywhen you licence some part of the spectrum to someone, you basically say hey, this lane is yours. Nobody else can touch it. And then there is another lane which is for the public and they use Wi-Fi for it. Now, what happens is that more and more cars are getting into this lane and there is only one lane. And we start saturating this lane. What do we do? We look across at the licensed lane, which is registered to someone and we see that nobody is using it frequently and its just sitting there. But the law states that you can only use this one lane. And all this while more and more cars are coming and we feel there is scarcity. But the truth is that this is artificial scarcity. So, the work I ended up doing was to see if those unused lanes could be used without interfering with someone elses licensed lane and on how to detect the presence of others in that lane. When I detect youre coming, then I just get out and go back in the other lane. India seems to be lagging countries such as the US and the UK in terms of embracing the opportunity hereAbsolutely. India is behind in terms of thinking of new forms of spectrum usage. I do believe that is the case. If you go talk to the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) in the US and Ofcom in the UK, just look at some of the progressive things these guys are doing. In India, weve seen companies like Google and Facebook attempt moon shots with permission from the government and provide Internet access through balloon projects such as Loon to remote parts of the country. But weve surprisingly seen opposition on White-Fi. What does the government and the telecom lobby need to do on this matter? Is there a general lack of understanding of how this technology can benefit the masses? There is no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem. I dont think the answer is that telcos will solve everything. If they claim that, I dont agree with that. I dont think balloons will solve everything either. All these different technologies will play a role and theyll fit different needs. I think it will fulfil an important need. You cannot solve everything (with just White-Fi) as well. Lets assume that spectrum operated by Wi-Fi was operated by a telcoalmost certainly it wouldnt have taken off. Every time you would have turned your Wi-Fi modem on, you would pay the telco money. Today you dont pay anybody anything. So, I dont agree with the view that telcos will solve every problem. What is the potential of White-Fi in terms of connecting millions to affordable Internet? If spectrum is a good owned by the people, then the right thing is you want to raise revenue from it and at the same time want to maximize the usage of spectrum. Lets assume that you raise revenue from it and the spectrum is actually not being used. Then you have a losing proposition... I dont know if (White-Fi) can solve all (connectivity) problems, but it can certainly have a positive impact and become one of the many technologies that helps. And fundamentally, in my mind, it alters the way we think about spectrum. These are important policy decisions which will alter peoples lives down the line. I do admire the US on thistheyve been much more open-minded on this. I think there is a case to be made here as well. I think it is inevitable that there will be an increasing wave of opportunism in terms of spectrum use. Its like what Andy Grove said once: if you have a great piece of technology, you can send lawyers and bureaucrats to delay it. Ultimately the technology goes around it. Can you talk about some of your work in this area? Aside from my thesis on this subject, I even have a follow-on paper that was published. Its all there in my thesisits called SATYA, which was an algorithm, a system that we built with one of my professors at Harvard, where we showed that even on top of this, you can actually raise revenues. We showed how it lowers the barrier for access to spectrum, while also increasing overall revenues. This will be an inevitable part of our futureand thats what my work shows, what are some of these challenges and how do we overcome them. And how it will fundamentally alter our view on how spectrum is used.So, what are some of the challenges facing India?In this country and every country, our issue is about how do you connect more and more people to the Internet. There are a couple of different ways in which it can happen. One, you assume there is a fibre to every home. But we both know thats prohibitively expensive to build and to maintain. Its not easy. Second, everything will be through wireless, such as 4G. I think thatll work to a certain extent, but as we have seen in other countries such as the UK and the US, if you try to wire up large portions of the country where you dont have purchasing power, then the economic argument is not justified. In my mind, Ive always felt there is some other way to connect these people. I think there is room to wire up large parts of the country with some sort of semi-unlicensed spectrum. So, are we talking about the need for a wide-scale policy overhaul in India on this matter?Absolutely. Separately, how do you view Reliance Jios entry and the current price wars that are brewing between telcos?Im a fan of anything where the consumer wins. If I can get 4G everywhere at a reasonable price, Im happy.",2016-12-10,MZp7mAMVUiI5Nm8jZaqvwK,"The founder of Murty Classical Library on his research on White-Fi, or white space network, and the focus on architecture for dynamic spectrum access in wireless networks",competitor,01:48,Spectrum in general is underutilized: Rohan Murty

-0.25,"Bengaluru: Wipro Ltd, which launched its artificial intelligence (AI) platform Holmes 18 months ago, is now making its biggest push to embrace automation by allowing more of its managers to identify work which will not require engineers in each of the over 20,000 projects currently underway.
				   
				This bold development, according to one executive who did not want to be identified will mean Wipro doesnt just save on costs (thereby arresting falling profitability), but fundamentally alters the traditional model of deploying armies of engineers to undertake maintenance work.To be sure, that could also mean that its current workforce needs to learn new technology skills swiftly to stay relevant.Wipro is in the process of appointing individual leaders in each of the six industry-serving segments (which the company calls strategic business units) and five solution offering verticals or practices, who will be entrusted with the job of automating mundane maintenance work.Until now, Wipros chief technology officer K.R. Sanjiv, in consultation with various segment heads used to decide which projects could use Holmes. Wipros two larger rivals, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd, too have a similar centralized division that oversees the adoption of their respective intelligent automation platforms, Ignio and Mana. This explains why these companies, which employ hundreds of thousands of engineers, have embraced automation only in tiny pockets.At Wipro, this will now change. We announced internally in this quarter that we will have a more federated structure than running it from a central unit, which will further increase the pace (of adoption), Abidali Neemuchwala, chief executive officer of Wipro said last month.Hyper-automation is one of the central pillars of Neemuchwalas vision of making Wipro a $15 billion firm by 2020 with an operating margin of 23%. Wipro ended the year to March with $7.35 billion in revenue and 20.5% profitability. Wipro is consolidating all its automation assets and capabilities under the Holmes brand and significantly increasing its investment in hyper-automation. Going forward, every strategic business unit, service line and delivery unit will have dedicated leaders for Holmes, said a spokesperson for Wipro. They will be responsible for adoption of the existing capability and ideation of new use cases.In the first six months of the current financial year, Wipro claims to have freed and redeployed over 4,300 employees in newer areas of work, on account of automation. The managements decision to decentralize decision-making means Wipro could look to automate work of close to 10,000 engineers by the end of the financial year, according to a second executive who spoke on condition of anonymity.We are well ahead of our plan for the financial year. (But) we will not be able to provide information beyond what has so far been disclosed publicly, said the spokesperson.Experts are encouraged by the managements decision.Aligned with a market maturation around the broad notion of Intelligent Automation, Wipro is changing gears in the way it is engaging with stakeholders, said Thomas Reuner, the managing director at IT outsourcing advisory, HfS Research.Each of these Holmes leaders will be evaluated on the work they can automate. All of them will have individual targets, said the second executive. Until now, much of the work (that has been automated) is what is maintenance or L0 type. Hopefully, as we push automation, more L1 or L2 (higher order) work in areas such as application development or even software writing can be automated.Wipros aggressive push towards embracing automation comes at a time when automation platforms and cloud computing are threatening to erase the labour arbitrage enjoyed by Indian IT vendors.Still, Wipro, which has focused on demonstrating robust delivery and learning the lessons from the early deployments of its AI platform, will now, much like its peers, demonstrate that it can manage the transition from labour arbitration to automation in profitable manner, said Reuner.",2016-11-02,MfyyMa0zsQOTnJQGmZqHqK,Wipro is appointing individual leaders in each of the six industry-serving segments and five solution-offering verticals to reduce mundane maintenance work,competitor,04:35,Wipro in biggest automation push since launch of Holmes AI platform
-0.07,"Wipro Ltd has underperformed peers for so long that expectations from it typically run low. It was no different with the companys March quarter results announcement; analysts were expecting organic growth of only around 1% compared with the December quarter.
				   
				But Wipro fell short of even these low expectations. Its revenues were flat after adjusting for the impact of two acquisitions it closed during the March quarter. Worse still, it has guided for between 1% and 3% growth for the June quarter, even though the full contribution of the HealthPlan Services acquisition will add about two percentage points to growth. At the mid-point of its guidance, therefore, organic growth is again expected to be flat.While Wipro has taken various steps to stem the decline in its growth rate, the fruit of these actions is still not visible. Apart from the troubles in the energy and utilities industry, which contributes to 15% of total revenue, the company is also grappling now with challenges some of its banking and financial services clients in Continental Europe are facing. In the energy and utilities segment, Wipro said that discretionary spending will come back when there is some stability in gas prices. Meanwhile, the gap vis-à-vis industry growth rates has only widened. On a year-on-year basis, growth in organic revenue stood at merely 3.7% in the March quarter. The industry is growing at around 10% in dollar terms. Margins were below estimates, too, despite an unexpected pickup in employee utilization benefits from the rupees depreciation. The company said that margins in its India and Middle East business fell because of certain investments, whereas commensurate revenues from these initiatives are still to be recognized.The only silver lining was the companys announcement for buy-back worth Rs.2,500 crore. Of course, the promoters are likely to receive a large portion of this, in proportion to their 73% stake. Even so, the buy-back using the tender offer route is a tax-efficient way to return cash to shareholders. Along with the dividends announced for the year, Wipro has increased its payout ratio to 48% in fiscal year 2015-16. In FY15, it paid shareholders 41% of the years profit, and in the preceding four years, its payout was around 30% of net profit. The higher payout will result in better return ratios, and the lower cash balance could act as a hurdle against large and risky acquisitions.But the positives from the buy-back are captured in the companys shares, which have risen by nearly 10% in the past five trading sessions.

0.12,"Tech Mahindra Ltd reported strong revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter. Revenue in US dollar terms increased 4.1% in the December quarter (Q3). In constant currency terms, it is up 5.4% from the September quarter (Q2). In comparison, HCL Technologies Ltd, which reported a strong performance, has seen its constant currency revenue rise 3% on a sequential basis.
				   
				As in the case of HCL Technologies, Tech Mahindra also benefited from inorganic growth initiatives. Even then, reported growth surpassed Street estimates. Kotak Institutional Equities, for instance, was expecting constant currency revenue growth of 3.8%.Tech Mahindras Q3 profit up 14% to Rs856 croreThe growth is led by BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) and retail, transport and logistics verticals. Communications, which is still the single largest business vertical for Tech Mahindra, registered 1.7% sequential growth in revenue. In constant currency terms, the division is said to have grown by 3%.Where the company did not impress or exceed expectations is profitability. Despite the favourable baseQ2 has seen one-time restructuring expensesthe Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin expanded just 80 basis points to 15.7%. According to an analyst with a domestic broking firm, adjusting for the Q2 restructuring expense, the margin would drop 40 basis points. But then, as the analyst clarifies, margins can see volatility on a quarterly basis as the company integrates recent acquisitions. A basis point is 0.01%.Management commentary otherwise is encouraging. The management expects the enterprise business vertical to have outperformed the industry in the last quarter and it expects the momentum to continue. The company signed a large deal in the BFSI division and said its focus on a portfolio of services and geographical diversification is helping it overcome business volatility.In a conference call with analysts, the management alluded to a recovery in the troubled communications business, citing a large order win. The number of active clients has risen to 837 from 825 in Q2 and 801 in the year-ago quarter. Client additions were highest in the $1-10 million contract category.While the commentary should comfort investors who otherwise are worried about the overall slowdown in the IT (information technology) sector, profitability remains a weak link in Tech Mahindra. It is reducing costs through automation, which should aid profitability.The savings, however, can be undermined by wage hikes (scheduled in the next quarter, though a decision is yet to be taken). Also clouding the margin outlook is the change in political regime in the US and fear that the country will raise visa costs for IT employees. Britain is yet to emerge out of the European Union, the incidence of which can raise business uncertainty, as it is another key market for Tech Mahindra.While the issues affect the whole IT sector, the Tech Mahindra stock did relatively better than the BSE IT index in the last six months on growth recovery.

				I think its a good step forward, but the quantum could have been bigger because they have Rs40,000 crore on their balancesheet.

				MAIN SECTIONMistry familys allegations Mismanagement at Tata Sons and oppression of minority shareholdersRatan Tata abused the powers vested in him as the erstwhile chairman of the Tata group in terms of the various businesses entered into which includes Nano car project, acquisition of Corus, Tata Teleservices, Air Asia, dealings C. Sivasankaran and M Pallonji & Co.Corporate governance breakdown and excessive interference by Tata TrustsTata and other trustees, acting as shadow directors, have been controlling Tata Sons as a super-board with trustee-nominated directors accustomed to act under the instructions of Tata Trusts, which hold 66% in Tata Sons. The trustees sought to micro manage the governance of Tata Sons.Illegal removal of the executive chairmanThe executive chairman was removed without any notice or explanation. Abuse of articles of associationThe article of associations of Tata Sons, whose aim was to have a governance framework to protect the firms interests, have been converted into a regime enabling the control of Tata Sons by Ratan Tata and Noshir Soonawala, trustees of the Tata Trusts.Violation of insider trading normsLaw violations by Tata and Noshir Soonawala , a trustee for procuring unpublished price sensitive information from listed Tata companies.Tata Sons responseIssues raised are nothing but a ruse by Cyrus Mistry. This is merely to publicly express his displeasure at the loss of his office as the executive chairman of Tata Sons. It is an attempt to besmirch the reputation of the Tata group.Mistrys removal not illegalMistrys removal was resolved upon by a majority of the directors (seven out of nine directors who voted in favour of Mistrys removal as the executive chairman).Mistry was well acquainted with the affairs of Tata Sons and the Tata group  This was much before Mistry became the executive chairman in December 2012. He was part of the boards deliberations in respect of several decisions which he is now attempting to call into question.Why now? Mistry is seeking to justify the inexplicable delay by the petitioner in availing judicial remedies. He did not take the requisite step to address the alleged mismanagement and oppression nor did he bring it to the notice of the board of Tata Sons. He rose from slumber to voice this grievance only after he was removed.Allegations levelled against Ratan Tata misconceived All decisions at Tata Sons and Tata companies have been taken by the relevant management teams. In his own draft presentation Mistry had proposed an active and consistent engagement with the trusts and the trust nominee directors.No special treatment to C. Sivasankaran The allegations with respect to the instances of dealings with C. Sivasankaran, chairman of the Siva group, are not relevant to the present proceedings for alleged oppression of the petitioners and alleged mismanagement of the affairs of Tata Sons. There is absolutely nothing on record to suggest that these transactions involved a degree of undue favour or special treatment at the behest of Tata group companies.Flawed business decision do not tantamount to acts of oppression Assuming but without conceding that these business decisions were in fact flawed and imprudent, such transactions do not tantamount to acts of oppression or mismanagement as is the settled legal position.What Mistry family has asked the NCLTWind up Tata Sons board and appointment of an administrator or appoint a retired Supreme Court judge as the non-executive chairman and appoint new independent directors.Restrain the so-called interim chairman from attending any meeting of the board of directors.Restrain Noshir Soonawala from interfering in the affairs of Tata Sons.Direct Tata Sons to not issue any securities which could lead to a dilution in the present equity capital.Restraint the respondent to the petition which includes Tata Sons, Tata Trusts and Ratan Tata from making any changes to the article of association unless its done with the consent of the honourable tribunal.Appoint an independent auditor to conduct a forensic accounting and independent investigations into the transactions of Air Asia, involving Mehli Mistry and associated entities, C. Sivasankaran and his business entities. And submit a report to the tribunal.Appoint an inspector to investigate into the of Sebis prohibition of insider trading breach by Ratan Tata and Noshir Soonawala and submit a report to the tribunal so that it can refer the findings to the Serious Fraud Investigation Office of the ministry of corporate affairs.Appoint a forensic auditor to re-investigateDirect Tata Trusts to bring back into Tata Sons the funds used by Tata Sons for acquiring shares of Tata Motors.Restrain Tata Sons from entering any new line of business or acquiring any new business without the consent of the tribunal and that to after it has been discussed with the board of directors without applying 121 of article of association.Restrain the trustees from interfering in affairs of Tata Sons and various companies that are part of Tata group.Restrain the existing selection committee from discharging any duty and appoint a new committee.Direct that no candidate selected by the committee pursuant to the article 118 of the article of association of Tata Sons be appointed without the consent of the Tribunal.Direct Tata Sons not to demand unpublished price sensitive information from any listed Tata group companyPass an order which is in the interest of justice and brings an end to the acts of oppression and mismanagement.SECOND SECTION Face-off: Ratan Tata vs Cyrus MistryThe genesis of the current crisis emanated from the personality differences between the then chairman of Tata Sons and chairman emeritus. Here are the few key issues which became the bone of contention between the two.Allegations against Ratan TataA chairman who never retired.His insistence of being a super board by wanting to pre-vet and pre-decide what gets formal approval to the Tata Sons board shows he was never happy being chairman emeritus but saw himself as chairman who never retired.Board of Tata Sons removed Mistry at the behest of Ratan Tata.It was under the influence of Tata that the board ousted Mistry.Remote controlling operations of Tata group companies.Tata was seeking to control key decisions in key Tata group companies through abuse and misuse of article of association. Any deviation from the approach sought by him would be attacked by him as a violation of articles of association.Aviation misadventure, Nano car project and flawed overseas acquisition strategy. Ratan Tatas passion for flying and aviation industry in general led the Tata group into aviation business. Every decision in the sector relating to Taj Air, B Jets, Piaggio Aero and more recently AirAsia and Vistara has inflicted serious damage to Tata group and to Tata Sons interests.As there is no line of sight to profitability for the Nano, any turnaround strategy for the company requires to shut it down. Emotional reasons alone have kept the company away from this crucial decision. The foreign acquisition strategy, with the exceptions of JLR and Tetley, had left a large debt overhang.Friends of Ratan Tata While some of them were bestowed powers to commit serious investment decisions on behalf of the Tata Sons while others were granted extraordinary and undue favours. These include Mehli Mistry, the chairman of M. Pallonji group, won contracts from Tata Power Co. Ltd at rates much higher than the prevalent market rates, while due to the special treatment, C. Sivasankaran, chairman Siva group, made a fortune by investing in Tata Teleservices Ltd (TTSL).RATAN TATAs RESPONSEOn him being a super board The allegations are unfounded. It is at Mistrys invitation that he was made chairman emeritus. Such an invitation would not have been extended had Mistry harboured such fundamental objections to Tatas term as chairman. Even upon assuming office, Mistry continued to seek Tatas guidance and views.On Mistrys removal Mistrys removal as the chairman of Tata Sons was led by the complete erosion of confidence and widening of trust deficit amongst the board of directors of Tata Sons and a similar trust deficit between Mistry and Tata Sons principal shareholders.On remote controlling operations Tata offered his opinion only on being asked by Mistry and his views were not unsolicited. Tata also presented his well-intentioned point of view and shared his thoughts wherever he felt that doing so would further the best interests of Tata group. To now colour this as interference amounting to a case of oppressive conduct is regrettable to say the least. Mistrys petition is nothing but a personal attack with a view to besmirch Tata based on false and baseless allegations.On acquisitionsThe decision to acquire Corus at the stipulated price was the unanimous and conscious decision of the entire board of directors of Tata Steel in 2007. In fact, the board of Tata Sons, including Mistry, passed a board resolution for financing the acquisition by Tata Steel.On Tatas persistent resistance to shelve Nano project  He did not raise any objections in view of the volumes and contributions being made by the project. It is entirely without basis for Mistry to contend that it was Tata who thrusted the decision to continue with Nano upon the incumbent management of Tata Motors.On aviation misadventure The investments made by Tata Sons in the aviation sector, was an unanimous decision of the board. In fact, Mistry in his webcast to all the employees of Tata group recognized Tatas contribution in the aerospace plans. The documents placed on record by Mistry himself reveal that he constantly sought Tatas advice and inputs on the issues inflicting Tata Sons in the aviation sector.Response to the allegations regarding the special relationshipsOn C. SivasankaranIt is highly unjustified that Mistrys after all these years contends that TTSL investment or any other engagement with Sivasankarans companies, was driven by personal relationships rather than the collective commercial wisdom of the board of Tata Teleservices Ltd.On Mehli MistryIt is also wrong to say that when Mistry took over as executive chairman of the Tata group, he pursued a policy of all Tata group companies awarding large contracts solely because of competitive bidding to ensure that the Tata group companies receive the maximum benefit possible from their contracts with third parties. Such statement clearly insinuates that before Mistrys tenure, the contracts were being awarded by the Tata group companies without following a due process.Sapna Agarwal contributed to this story.",2017-01-31,NUG4OYNFBmmDMQ5mHsyGvL,"The National Company Law Tribunal, or NCLT, will start hearing the petition from Tuesday  on the Tata Sons-Cyrus Mistry row",company,10:39,Tata Sons-Cyrus Mistry spat: What the affidavits say

				At the same time, Mistry, 48, has accused Ratan Tata, the 78-year-old who wrested back control of the group, of everything from a control fetish to governance failures and bad judgment. According to Mistry, Ratan Tatas 2006 purchase of Corus Group Plcs British steel assets, his vanity small-car project as well as the acquisition of pricey hotels have exposed the empire that bears his familys name to an existential threat.Some of this could just be wounded pride, but even if Mistrys allegations have a kernel of truth, what does he gain from trash-talking a group in which his family owns 18.4%? One possible answer is that he mightif he can convince enough outside investors in operating companies to side with himprize open the loosely controlled conglomerate, and pluck out a big reward.Tuesdays shareholder meeting of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, the software business, may have been a practice session in that treasure hunt. Tata Sons 73% stake in TCS was enough for Ratan Tata to get Mistry thrown out as its chairman. But at five other companiesIndian Hotels Co. Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd, Tata Chemicals Ltd and Tata Power Co. Ltdthe founding group owns less than 40%. All of them hold shareholder meetings between 13 December and 26 December to vote on Mistrys fate.Also read: What if other Tata group shareholders vote the same way as those at TCS?In three of them, he will have a formidable backer. Mistrys own core supporters, fired together with him, have no clout. But Nusli Wadia, the scion of one of Indias oldest business families, is a heavyweight. He has spent a combined 90 years on three Tata boards.At Tata Steel, where Wadia is the longest-serving independent director, hes already questioning the validity of the companys brand licensing agreement with Tata Sons, a younger company that received its first royalty payment 91 years after the steelmakers founding. Wadia wants an examination of the agreement.A similar suggestion at Tata Motors, where Wadia has been on the board for 18 years, would be a thinly veiled call for mutiny. The ultimate prize may be Jaguar Land Rover, the crowning glory of Ratan Tatas dealmaking career.Tata Sons boosted its stake in Tata Motors by 1.7% on the day of the TCS vote, and is open to buying more ahead of the 22 December extraordinary general meeting. This must be the Wadia effect. Even at TCS, retail shareholders overwhelmingly voted against Mistrys ouster. If Wadias PR spiel can swing enough of them away from Ratan Tata, the latters control of Jaguar Land Rover might be at risk, provided Mistry can raise money for an open offer to shareholders, a condition on which the market regulator may well insist. And that could split the empire.Also read: Message for Tata Sons in bittersweet victory at TCS EGMOn both sides, theres much high-minded talk about values, and how the other camp was ruining the groups reputation for fair play by cutting ethical corners.

0.15,"San Francisco: Personal computer shipments notched their first quarterly growth in five years, researcher IDC said, though the gain of less than 1% from a year earlier underscored persistent weakness in demand, especially from consumers.
				   
				Shipments totalled 60.3 million units in the first three months of the year, compared with 59.9 million in the same period a year earlier, IDC said Tuesday in a statement. It marked the first increase since the first quarter of 2012, IDC said.Gartner Inc., another major tracker of PCs, reported a decline of 2.4% for first-quarter global shipments. Both research companies said the business market for PCs had improved though not enough to offset a decline in consumer customers.Sales of desktop and laptop computers have been in decline as consumer demand shifted to smartphones and tablets for easily checking email or the internet on the go. Now the industry is counting on more interest in its machines from businesses and consumers wanting to replace aging hardware with sleeker and more powerful products that feature upgraded software. IDC and Gartner use their own methods for counting shipments in these reports, which are preliminary. Gartner, for example, includes desktops, notebooks and related devices such as Microsoft Corporations Surface, but not Googles Chromebook. IDC includes Chromebooks, but not the Surface in this report, according to Jay Chou, research manager at IDC.The major brands in the industry all posted market share gains. HP retook the top spot with 22% in the first quarter, up from 19% a year earlier, IDC said. China-based Lenovo Group Ltd. posted a smaller uptick to 20.4% and Dell Technologies had 16%. Apple rose to 7% from 6.7%.Gartner puts Lenovo at number 1 with HP at number 2. Dell grabbed the number 3 spot, while Apple was number 5.Prices are climbing as key memory components get more expensive amid a shortage in the industry, according to Mikako Kitagawa, an analyst at Gartner. This doesnt bode well for PC makers.The price hike will suppress PC demand even further in the consumer market, discouraging buyers away from PC purchases unless it is absolutely necessary, Kitagawa said in the statement. The price hike started affecting the market in 1Q17.In the US, Gartner said shipments fell 2.4%, with consumer demand dragging down sales.

-0.95,"Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd named Ravi Venkatesan as co-chairman and decided to payout Rs13,000 crore to shareholders through dividends and/or share buyback, in an attempt to buy peace with its promoters and other shareholders. Starting this year, the company will use 70% of its free cash flows (as against 63% earlier) to award dividends or buy back shares.
				   
				The company made both announcements while declaring its results for the fourth quarter of 2016-17 and the full year. In the January-March quarter, Infosys reported a 0.7% sequential rise in dollar revenue to $2.57 billion (about Rs17,000 crore), allowing it to end fiscal 2016-17 with a 7.4% growth and $10.21 billion in revenue. Net profit declined 0.8% to $543 million in the March quarter, from $547 million in the October-December period. For the full year, the net profit was $2.14 billion.ALSO READ: Infosyss Rs13,000 crore payout falls short of what investors needBut the big news in the company, which has, over the past few months witnessed an unseemly scrap between its promoters and board and management over issues related to corporate governance, an irregular and very generous severance package given to its former chief financial officer, and salaries of the chief executive and chief operating officer, was the elevation of Venkatesan, now an independent director, and the shareholder payout.The appointment of a co-chairman was one of founder N.R. Narayana Murthys demands when hostilities between the promoters and the board, led by chairman R. Seshasayee and management were at their peak in early February. At the time, an Infosys spokesperson termed Mints query on this  speculative.  It isnt clear whether Venkatesan, former chairman of Microsoft India and the chairman of Bank of Baroda who has been on the board of Infosys since 2011, is  the person Murthy wanted as co-chairman. Murthy didnt respond to a query. Venkatesan responded with a text message saying: Big challenges; bigger opportunities.Analysts have also argued that the promoters could be seeking a share buyback. Two of Infosyss former CFOs, T.V. Mohandas Pai and V. Balakrishnan have articulated this demand.Analysts see three possible reasons for the announcements made on Thursday.One, the board wants to buy peace so that the management can be insulated from what CEO Vishal Sikka calls as distractions, which were partially responsible for a poor 0.7% sequential growth during the January-March period.ALSO READ: Infosys will have to live with H1B visa policy: Vishal SikkaTwo,  Venkatesans elevation suggests that the board is working towards a succession plan, which could  possibly even see Seshasayee stepping down in  coming months, well before his term ends in June 2018. This too, was a demand raised by the promoters at one time.Three, the sudden elevation of Venkatesan could suggest that the  founders have won their 10-month long battle to regain control of the board.Infosyss board has Sikka and COO U.B. Pravin Rao as executive members and eight independent directors. Other than Seshasayee, Venkatesan and D.N. Prahlad, a former employee and a relative of Murthy who was appointed last year, the other independent directors are Punita Kumar-Sinha, John W. Etchemendy, Jeffrey Sean Lehman, Roopa Kudva and Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw.Some analysts and executives in the IT industry who know both Murthy and Venkatesan say the two share a good rapport.Knowing Ravi, I  believe he will certainly be able to bring both parties (together) and (get them to) agree on things (so) that  public spats dont happen and consensus between the founders and the board and management is reached.One proxy advisory firm said the appointment sends out the wrong message.The appointment of Ravi Venkatesan as co-chairman may be construed as signs of Infosyss board listening to feedback.

-0.05,"Mumbai: Running a marathon is a metaphor for Natarajan Chandrasekarans career. 
				   
				Twice over.In Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), a business he will lead until 21 February, Chandra, as he is popularly known, has spent almost 30 years, his entire working life.He started as a software programmer with TCS in 1987 and rose through the ranks to become one of the youngest chief executive officers (CEOs) in Tata group when he was 46 years old in 2009.Now, as he prepares to take over as chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, Chandrasekaran is in effect getting ready to run another marathon.He is 53 and the retirement age for top Tata executives is 70, giving him a potential 17 years at the helm of the $103-billion group that has businesses ranging from salt to steel and tea to telecom.Running a marathon is also a metaphor for running a business, according to Chandrasekaran.You have to decide on the length of the engagement, develop endurance to handle setbacks and increase speed when the competition demands it, Chandrasekaran said in an interview to Runners World magazine in October 2015 (bit.ly/2iFOCtK).You have to perform with your heart and your mind; you will not get lost on the way if you have a good road map; you will get nowhere without discipline. This is what I always tell my employees in speeches, he said.He will start running his new marathon at a time when Tata group is in the midst of a bruising battle with its former chairman, Cyrus Mistry, who was sacked on 24 October in a boardroom putsch, less than four years after he succeeded family scion Ratan Tata.Also read: Tata vs Mistry: NCLT dismisses contempt of court plea filed by Mistry firmsThe feud between Mistry, who has accused the 149-year old business house of a variety of corporate governance violations, and Tata has reached the National Company Law Tribunal, or NCLT, where a long and messy legal battle is looming.The Mistry family is the largest minority shareholder in Tata Sons, the holding company of the group.We are at an inflection point, Chandrasekaran wrote in an emailed statement after his appointment. I am aware that this role comes with huge responsibilities. It will be my endeavour to help progress the group with the ethos, ethics and values that the Tata group has been built on.A Tata Sons spokesperson said the chairman-designate was not available for interviews immediately.Chandrasekaran, we believe will now inspire the entire Tata group to realize its potential acting as leaders in their respective businesses, always in keeping with our value system and ethics and adhering with the practices of the Tata group which have stood it in good stead, the Tata Sons board said in a statement on 12 January while announcing his elevation. The five-member selection committee chose him unanimously, it added.Also read: Tata Sons new chairman has twin obstaclesa family and a conglomerateChandrasekaran would be no stranger to the value systems and the practices that the board is talking about. The man who would have been a farmer joined the company after completing his Masters degree in computer applications from the Regional Engineering College in Trichy, Tamil Nadu. Over time, he has worked in a variety of positions (chief operating officer, executive assistant to S. Ramadorai, the previous CEO), and places (California and Stockholm). In that sense, he is an insider.He is an outsider because he is the first truly professional chairman of the Tata Sons board who is not related to the Tata family.Nowroji Saklatwala, the third chairman of the group, was the nephew of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of Tata group. Cyrus Mistry is the brother-in-law of Noel Tata, half brother of Ratan Tata.This can be interpreted in two ways: Either the Tatas chose a safe option by choosing an insider, or the group took a step forward to regain its tarnished credibility by choosing a non-family memberand one with a proven track recordto lead the firm.Also read: N. Chandrasekaran begins long road to restoring Tata groups imageIndeed, Chandrasekarans first task will be to restore the reputation of the group and the sheen of brand Tata.A day after his ouster, Mistry (in a letter that subsequently found its way into the public domain) said the Tata group was beset with a host of corporate governance issues.The group was staring at a potential $18-billion write-down, he claimed. It persisted with a loss-making project, the Nano small car, because it was an obsession with Ratan Tata; there was undue interference from some of the trustees of the Tata Trusts, which own two-thirds of Tata Sons; some friends and associates of Ratan Tata benefited from Tata group contractsthey all were a part of Mistrys lists of allegations.Subsequently, the listed companies of the Tata group lost 6.1% (till 16 January) of their market capitalization, and regulators began asking questions.The controversy at Tata group is not his (Chandrasekarans) creation. He just needs to ride it out. I think if he can build a reasonably supportive relationship with Cyrus, it will be good for the image of corporate India, said Ganesh Natarajan, vice-chairman at Zensar Technologies Ltd, who has worked with Chandrasekaran at software industry lobby Nasscom.Restoring the reputation is just a start. The fact remains that the Tata group has several underperformers. The so-called legacy hot spots which were named by MistryTata Power Co. Ltds Mundra plant in western Gujarat, Tata Steel Europe, Indian Hotels Co. Ltd, Tata Teleservices Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd passenger vehiclesall are pressure points.For instance, in the four years to fiscal 2016, Tata Steel has taken an impairment charge of at least Rs24,175 crore, most of it attributed to the European assets that it acquired with the 2007 purchase of Corus Group Plc for £6.7 billion (Rs54,000 crore today).In the past fiscal, losses at Coastal Gujarat Power Ltd (CGPL), which houses the Mundra plant, were Rs1,491.86 crore.Looking at data aggregated between 2011 and 2015 and limit the analysis largely to the legacy hot spots, it will show that the capital employed in those companies has risen from Rs1.32 trillion to Rs1.96 trillion A realistic assessment of the fair value of these businesses could potentially result in a write-down over time of Rs1.18 trillion, Mistry pointed out in his letter.But it wont be easy to rejuvenate these businesses. Selling or exiting them wont be a quick option since it will call into question the business wisdom and legacy of group patriarch Ratan Tata.Look at Tata Steel. Corus is a disaster, said T.V. Mohandas Pai, chairman of Manipal Global Education and former board of director at Infosys Ltd. Cyrus tried to change that by selling assets, but they ousted him as they said it was against Tata values, said Pai.Tata values, he said, cannot be based on destruction of shareholders value.Pai terms Chandrasekaran as a go getter who is great at marketing and building relationships, but he is not sure if he will get the much-needed free hand to run Tata Sons.Once he takes charge at Tata Sons, the key issue wont be whether he will be able to do well, but whether he will have operational freedom, he said.This talk of freedom to operate that Pai is talking about goes to the crux of Mistrys accusations.Mistry, in his 25 October letter, said he had been reduced to the position of a lame duck chairman.He accused Tata Trusts and some of the trusteesRatan Tata and Noshir Soonawala, in particularof excessive interference in the running of listed Tata companies.Documents filed by the Mistry family firmsCyrus Investments Pvt. Ltd and Sterling Investments Pvt. Ltdin NCLT alleged mismanagement of Tata Sons and oppression of minority shareholders, cited some examples and called them shadow directors.These charges have been strongly refuted by Tata and Soonawala in affidavits they filed in reply.Also read: Why Natarajan Chandrasekaran is a safe choice for Ratan TataLeaving this issue aside, Chandrasekaran will anyway have to establish a good working relationship with the principal shareholders of Tata Sons, both in terms of navigating the three-tier structure of the groupTata Trusts, Tata Sons and Tata group operating companiesand in meeting their expectations.Already, the trustees have come out with statements highlighting their concerns.The new leadership at Tata Sons should ensure that the overall profitability and income of the group improves, and the dividend payout by Tata Sons to Tata Trusts not only stabilizes but also increases, said V.R. Mehta, a trustee of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, in an interview, a day after Chandrasekarans elevation was announced.The main worry of the trust was the decline in the dividend income of Tata Sons from the operating companies, he said.In a 10 November statement, Tata Sons had pointed out that with the exception of TCS, all 40 other firms (many non-dividend paying) in its portfolio paid dividends that have continuously declined from Rs1,000 crore in 2012-13 to Rs780 crore in 2015-16.It said even the Rs780-crore figure included an interim dividend of Rs100 crore, which would have been normally received in 2016-17. Shriram Subramanian, managing director at InGovern Reearch, a proxy advisory firm, says while Chandrasekarans capabilities are beyond doubt, he needs to ensure that better corporate governance practices prevail in the group, and he is not seen as a yes man to Ratan Tata.Also read: Chandras true test will be shutting down Tatas loss-making businesses: Aswath DamodaranIn TCS at least, Chandrasekaran has proven to be his own man as can be seen from the 2008 reorganization of the software firm into five groups, whose directors began reporting directly to him.But the challenges will be different now, when it comes to dealing with other group CEOs, many of them his peers.To some extent, Chandra will also be constrained by not having the experience of having dealt with huge debt and with bankers, said Subramanian.TCS has been the cash cow of Tata group. It accounts for around 17.5% of the total revenue of the conglomerate. It is the company which spews cash to fund Tata ventures into newer businesses, allowing Tata Sons to act like a private equity investor.Chandrasekarans role so far has been to keep it running smoothly and build on the gains made previously; under him, TCSs market capitalization and revenues grew more than three times. But now, he needs to figure out ways to replicate his success with TCS in unfamiliar businesses.The culture in the IT (information technology) industry is one of youthful exuberance, service orientation, technological innovation and collaborative learningan antithesis to the rough and tough shop-floor realities of old-world industries, wrote Prabal Basu Roy, a Sloan Fellow from the London Business School and a chartered accountant, in a column on 14 January. Therefore, this cultural and skill set mismatch will be a major challengethough charismatic leadership can overcome some of this.But such concerns are brushed aside by Tata insiders.Also read: The many challenges of Natarajan ChandrasekaranIf the group chairman knows everything, it will create over dependence and everyone would look upon him rather than doing it on their own, said K. Santhanakrishnan, non-executive and non-independent director at Tata Global Beverages Ltd. The group needs his soft skills. The hardware already exists in the form of professionally managed boards and professional executive management. His experience in the software industry which has linkages with all the sectors and his wide international exposure and acceptability across, would really help the group.Chandrasekaran takes charge at a time when the group needs a strategic reorientation. With the election of Donald Trump, who has vowed to protect American jobs, as US President and the shift in customers spending patterns from traditional IT services to a digital domain, TCS itself is going to face tough times and may not be able to sustain its dividend track record.At the same time, tough calls have to be made to bring down group debt, which stands at Rs2.25 trillion, and which new businesses to focus on.The reactions I get to my philosophy are heartwarming. No less than a thousand employees responded to my call to run the Mumbai Marathon together, Chandrasekaran said in the Runners World interview.To succeed in his new job and successfully complete the metaphorical marathon he is embarking on, he will need a similar response from the 660,000 employees of Tata group.",2017-01-20,PUT0dMs7Buh2WJTdbafJzM,MintAsia examines the challenges Natarajan Chandrasekaran faces  as he prepares to take the helm at Tata Sons at a time when the group is engaged in an ugly feud with its ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry,both,01:26,Marathon Man

				The chief executives of the countrys biggest IT services companies will meet with administration officials and lawmakers from 20 February to try and dissuade Trumps team from raising requirements under the H-1B visa programme, said R.

Indias largest IT services corporations, including Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys Ltd, depend on the system to insert foreign talent on the ground to work with US clients.The message from H1B visa reformsTrumps administration is drafting an executive order aimed at overhauling the work-visa programmes used to hire tens of thousands of employees each year.Curbs could transform the way American firms such as Apple Inc. and Indian firms such as Wipro Ltd recruit, to offset a dearth of homegrown US engineering talent.Businesses would have to try to hire American first and if they opt for foreign workers, priority would be given to the most highly paidmaking hiring more expensive.We want to put across to the new administration and the lawmakers what would be lost by America closing those doors, said Chandrashekhar, who will join the delegation on a four-day visit to the US capital.Nasscom has already shared its concerns with its own government.The silver lining in immigration reformWe have talked to the government, which will do what it needs to do; but we are parallelly pursuing our own course of action.Its not clear how much force an executive order would carry if its signed by the president.Congress is also working on visa reforms and the parties will have to cooperate to pass new laws. Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat from California, introduced a bill last week to tighten requirements for the H-1B work visa programme.News of the draft executive order has sent Indian information technology (IT) stocks reeling this week and fuelled a sharp rise in inquiries to local placement firms from current H-1B visa holders exploring options back home.Senior executives are putting together contingency plans in the event they cant get enough workers into the US to work with their clients, which include many of Americas top banks and corporations.H1B visa reform: Why US companies are worrying about changesThe topic may well come up during a conversation between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump slated for June, Chandrashekhar said.Nasscom encompasses nearly 2,400 technology companies across the country but Chandrashekhar said the CEO delegation will comprise mainly chief executives of companies that are the biggest users of H-1B visas. He declined to name them but data show the heaviest employers include Tata Consultancy, Infosys, Wipro, HCL Technologies, Tech Mahindra and Mindtree.In New Delhi, foreign ministry spokesman Vikas Swarup said, No executive order has been signed so far.

				Mistrys team had prepared a governance report on issues related to the group structure, the two said, declining to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the issue. Mistry was removed before he had an opportunity to present these issues at the 24 October board meeting of Tata Sons. Tata trusts have all the rights through representation on the holding companys board to ensure that the flow of dividends for them is steady and that the company is not taking undue risks. However, the governance document sought to clarify the role of each entity and ensure that the promoters exercised their rights through their nominee directors, the two said. The root cause of the current conflict in the Tata group is the groups operating structure itself, proxy advisory firm Institutional Investors Advisory Services said in a 12 November note. Tata trusts exert control over Tata Sons, which exerts control over operating companies, several of which are publicly traded and subject to scrutiny by external stakeholders including shareholders, the note said.ALSO READ | Cyrus Mistry rebuts Tatas takeover bid claimThe governance document, the two people cited above said, is important in view of the events that culminated in the boardroom coup. On 24 October, the board of Tata Sons (with the exception of Ishaat Hussain and Farida Khambata) voted to remove Mistry as chairman. The new directors who were appointed on 25 August could not have had enough information to judge Mistrys performance, especially since their orientation programme was scheduled only on 2 November and 15 November, the people cited above said.On 8 August, the chairman of Tata trusts, Ratan Tata, sent a letter to the board of Tata Sons nominating Venu Srinivasan and Ajay Piramal as additional directors in his personal capacity. This bypassed the Tata Sons boards nomination and remuneration committee, and while it is within the law, it constitutes bad governance, these persons said. In the 25 August shareholder meeting, Tata Sons, with two-thirds ownership, confirmed the appointment of Piramal and Srinivasan. Because Tata trusts have the powers to nominate one-third of the board, Amit Chandra was appointed as a director the next day.ALSO READ | Will do whatever it takes to deal with Cyrus Mistry ouster: Tata SonsWe have said whatever we had to say in the 10 November statement, said a Tata group spokesperson.

The decision to sack Mistry was not an uninformed one, said two people close to the newly appointed directors. At least one director had multiple meetings with various stakeholders, including Mistry, said one of the two people close to the directors, adding that the director was well-briefed and had enough information. The second person said that the directors were provided adequate background material on Tata Sons, including minutes of earlier board meetings, detailed presentations and other important documents. This person also added that the new members participated robustly in discussing the strategy plan on 15 September. The directors were not satisfied with the new plan, this person said. Though Mint couldnt ascertain the agenda of the board meeting, another person with direct knowledge said that besides routine affairs, it included the presentation of a five-year strategy plan by Mistry. While one cannot question the capability of the independent directors, the issue is, did they actually understand the issue or were they coaxed, said J.N.

				Vedanta Resources also plans to spend $10 billion over the next three years across its businesses, of which $8 billion is earmarked for Indian operations, Agarwal said in an interview on the sidelines of the Global Natural Resources Conclave organized by Network18 and the Confederation of Indian Industry.In March, Agarwal announced the planned purchase of about 13% of Anglo Americans stock in an investment by his holding company Volcan Investments Ltd, making him the second-largest shareholder in the $26 billion company that counts diamond producer De Beers among its assets.  We are now looking at this work (the stake acquisition) that we have done as strategically being very important for India. We have focused on the fact that it (De Beers) is the largest global producer of diamonds and we (India) are the largest polisher of diamonds. We want all the diamonds to come to India. Secondly, India has enough diamond reserves. We will persuade them to produce diamonds in India, said Agarwal.We are a large shareholder in the company and they are also a friend of ours. So, we will speak with them. They are into fertilizers. They are also the largest coal producers. They also produce copper and magnesium. They are also the largest producers of platinum in the world. So, all of that can be done here, Agarwal added.His plans come in the backdrop of the National Democratic Alliance government working on a new method of auctioning mining leases to match commodity price cycles and investor appetite.Agarwals stake purchase in Anglo American came after the  company last year spurned his offer to merge part of his mining business.Agarwal didnt rule out acquiring a controlling stake in the firm, one of the worlds top five mining groups alongside BHP Billiton Plc., Rio Tinto Plc., Vale SA and Glencore Plc. Its key assets include giant copper mines in Chile, iron ore operations in Brazil and South Africa and De Beers.The company is bullish on its capital expenditure plans.We will invest $10 billion over the next three years. We will spend close to Rs60,000-70,000 crore, of which oil and gas will account for Rs15,000 crore. This will result in an increase in our capacity overall of 40-50%. Around 80% of these investments will be made in India,  Agarwal said.In 2011, Cairn Energy Plc. sold 58.5% of Cairn India Ltd to Vedanta Resources for $8.67 billion.

-0.24,"Mumbai: Shareholders of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, the first among the listed Tata group companies, will meet on Tuesday to decide the fate of the six-week-long Tata Mistry battle that has rocked Indias biggest conglomerate. Shareholders of Tata Industries Ltd on Monday removed Cyrus Mistry as director.
				   
				While the EGMs, to some extent, will end the indecisiveness facing the listed entities, its unlikely to bring the curtain down any time soon on one of the biggest corporate feuds seen in the recent past. If anything its going to be protracted battle with both sides likely to seek legal recourse and seeking intervention from market regulator and the government.Here is a quick analysis of the possible scenarios that are likely to emerge:If Tata Sons wins...Mistry gets removed as the director from the boards of various companies. He will also cease to be the chairman at firms where he continues to hold the position. Tata has ousted Mistry as chairman of Tata Consultancy Services, Tata Global Beverages Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd. He continues to be the chairman of Tata Motors Ltd, Tata Chemicals Ltd, Tata Power Co. Ltd and Indian Hotel and Co Ltd. However, Mistrys ejection from the board of Tata companies may not warrant peace to Tatas, said legal experts. Being a shareholder (18.5%) in Tata Sons he can continue to fight. Even if he is ousted, he has the right to arouse his grievances as he has been in the management and is also a shareholder, said a corporate lawyer who declined to be identified. Also read: Tata: 1, Mistry: 0, but this fight has just begunAlso, shareholders who believe Mistry has been wronged can approach the market regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India or Sebi, and the government to intervene and probe for insider trading, disclosure norms and financial discipline.If Mistry wins...He continues to be a director on the boards of all the operating companies. Tata Sons will have no option left but to take the legal recourse to remove him from the board of companies. Such a scenario may lead to a divided board which is not in the interest of the larger stakeholders of the company, said Kavil Ramachandran, executive director, Thomas Schmidheiny Centre for Family Enterprise, Indian School of Business. A divided board is not good for any organization, he said pointing out that it will also have an adverse impact on the plans and decisions taken by the board. Amit Tandon managing director at IiAS, a proxy firm, agreed. It will bring unwanted disruptions on the board, said Tandon.Also read: Nusli Wadia alleges lapses in corporate governance at Tata Sons, Tata TrustsA defeat in the EGM may prompt Tata Sons to seek intervention from the market regulator and the government as they would want to be vindicated and prove their they were right in their allegations, said the lawyer cited above. It may lead to the government appointing an independent arbitrator.Stakeholder Empowerment Services, a proxy firm, in a note points out that in the eventuality of the resolution being defeated Mistry will have to make an open offer alone or along with the board members who had supported him.Relationship between different Tata entitiesTo be sure, with Tata Sons citing trust deficit and betrayal as one of the key reasons for ousting Mistry and the latter alleging the Tata Trusts wielding too much of influence on Tata Sons and operating companies, the role play by each entity has come into a sharp focus. While IiAss Tandon believes the current crisis is an opportunity for the group to fix its structural issues not every one agrees. ISBs Ramachandran said while there is a need to revisit the current structure it should have its own merit and the current scenario should not be a catalyst for it. The ad-hoc decisions may not be objective, said Ramachandran pointing out that the current crisis has been borne out of personality conflict between two individuals and their priorities. I dont think it has to do with governance or the structure. The very same arrangement have served the group successfully over the years.On 11 December, Tata Sons Ltd asked shareholders of group companies to vote out Mistry from their boards, even as it accused him of concentrating authority, dismantling the groups 150-year-old structure and causing a breach of trust by not distancing himself from the Shapoorji Pallonji group, controlled by Mistrys family.",2016-12-13,R1NsfReoXB6hkz1IUWOCtI,A quick analysis of the possible scenarios that are likely to emerge at TCS shareholders vote on Cyrus Mistrys directorship today ,company,09:42,"Possible scenarios for Tata Sons, Mistry as shareholders begin to vote from today"
-1.0,"Squeeze the honey out of Dabur. Now Baba Ramdev did not say this, when he recently said he will take the gate out of Colgate and coined similar fates for other foreign-owned brands. But he may well have. Dabur India Ltd said its health supplements business grew in single digits in the March quarter, as its honey sales were affected by Patanjali honeys aggressive launch. Patanjalis 500g honey bottle has a list price of Rs.135 versus Daburs Rs.199 (exclusive of discount) on bigbasket.com.
				   
				Daburs management says it will not compete on price (but bigbasket.com is offering the 500g bottle at a discounted price of Rs.169.15); instead it has launched a squeezy honey bottle and will launch value-added variants next month. The initial impact has been harsh but surprisingly, Dabur has only words of praise for its competitor. It sees Patanjali as prising open a huge opportunity for products with a herbal/Ayurvedic tilt.Chief executive Sunil Duggal said Patanjali may actually help in products such as chyawanprash, which they have struggled to grow in recent years. Warm weatherit sells most in winteris one reason, but he said the product also lacked the kind of evangelism or disruptive influence that Ramdev has brought.Duggals logic is Patanjali may initially eat into incumbents markets but Ramdevs efforts can grow the market too. In oral care, for instance, Daburs growth has benefited from more demand for Ayurvedic/herbal toothpastes. Though Dabur does not sell ghee, Duggal remarked that Ramdev appears to have added new consumers for this product. As disruptive change goes, theres no knowing what will happen but Daburs view is one possibility, an optimistic one at that.Daburs March quarter results show better sales growth, up by 8.5% in value terms and by 7% in volume. Value sales growth is better than the December quarters fall of 2.5%. The end of the blockade on the India-Nepal border has seen its food business come back strongly. That had affected growth in the preceding quarter. Apart from food and oral care, the home care business did well too. Daburs international business saw organic growth (excluding the impact of acquisitions/divestitures) of 19.3% compared with 10.7% growth in the preceding quarter. The recovery in sales growth, some support from price increases, slower increase in costs, all contribute to an increase in its Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin, both from a year ago and the preceding quarter. A higher tax rate lowered net profit growth to 16.6% compared with a pre-tax profit growth of 20%.Daburs management expects the second half of FY17 to see better sales growth, contingent on a good monsoon. It is still seeing weak rural growth and no significant support from the urban general trade channel (kirana shops). Modern trade is selling well, however. Although some input costs are moving up, the company is not expecting to see significant price increases. Its a cautious outlook, justifiable considering that past optimism in the sector has not always played out, and what with a hungry competitor on the prowl.Daburs share fell by 1.05% on Thursday. It trades at 38 times the price-to-earnings ratio for the year ended 31 March. FY16 was a tough year but the current fiscal year looks to be a better one, although not if the companys cautious outlook proves right.

				Edited excerpts: This year is shaping up to be perhaps the roughest ever for Indias technology companies. How do you think Indian start-up ecosystem should prepare themselves going forward?The startp-up ecosystem in India is evolving and as per the latest report by Nasscom- ZINNOV, India will be home to 10,500 start-ups by 2020. However, there is still a long way to go for the start-ups. On one hand, the start-ups need to come up with very deeply differentiated business models which will add value to their customers, and at the same time make their processes efficient and frugal - for example, leverage existing API (application programming interface) s as much as possible to build products rather than developing products from scratch. They need to make their investments work twice as hard to build their business in 2017 and beyond. Another example of things that can help is to be very user focused when they build their business vs being product feature-focused. Alignment to the end user is critical at an early stage and start-ups must embed design thinking aspect as they build their product.When it comes to global ecosystems, London is the first thing on ones mind when you talk fintech. What do you think of the fintech opportunity in India?The fintech industry has gained momentum in India since the beginning of 2015. The industry witnessed the emergence of numerous fintech start-ups, incubators, and investments from public and private investors. The key enablers in the industry like government policies, regulatory framework coupled with various banks like ICICI and AXIS coming up with their accelerators to work along with entrepreneurs has helped to drive the momentum in India. The fintech start-ups are further leveraging various government initiatives like Jan Dhan Yojna, Aadhaar, and Digital India and we will see a lot of innovation happening in this space in the coming years. While there is a lot of growth opportunity for this sector, the companies also need to look at greater collaboration between various players and amalgamate learnings and entrepreneurial experiences for further growth of this sector. There should also be a cohesive fintech environment built for complete infrastructure penetration. We are witnessing some innovation in the P2P (peer-to-peer) lending, robo advisory, bank-in-a-box, security and biometrics areas which are treading fast towards mass market implementation, with technology like blockchain just marking its entry with a promising future for the fintech companies.What is your take on Indian governments approach to the start-up ecosystem in India?The government has launched many progressive programs to address the requirements of the start-up ecosystem in India. (With) Start Up India, along with programmes like Make in India, the government is giving a further boost to the start-up community. Government is also focusing on making start-ups leverage new age technologies and has set up National Initiative for Development and Harnessing Innovations (NIDHI), an umbrella programme which aims to nurture ideas and innovations in the start-up ecosystem. ...friendly policies like waiving income tax on their profit for the first three years, a simple exit policy, fast tracking of the patent applications, 80% exemption in patent fee, self-certification based compliance system etc are bold move to get more young minds in the start-up space. There can be more work done to support the growth of start-ups in India by driving structured collaboration between government and corporates. We believe that with emergence of new technologies like cognitive, cloud, IoT (Internet of Things), design thinking etc. and governments push for R&D (research and development) the startup ecosystem can transform the innovation culture and place India on a high growth trajectory.Exits are still an issue in India, when do you see them happening?We believe the Indian start-up ecosystem is quite fragmented and while we have a lot of B2C start-ups, we do require more focus on B2B and on start-ups that are differentiated by IP or deep tech. Start-ups also need to focus on building a scalable business, with an international outlook and catering to standards that make them attractive to large global tech companies or global clients. There is a need for uniqueness and use of deep technology to distinguish from B2C models. We believe for exits to ramp up, there needs to be a concerted approach by all players in the ecosystem and to possibly replicate the success that Israelas one examplehas seen. We do see the government being aligned towards helping start-ups not just grow but also help in their exit process. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Bill 2015, tabled in the Lok Sabha last December, has provisions for fast track and/or voluntary closure of businesses. With the shelf life of Internet-born companies among consumers being low for various reasons like competitive market, too many options, cashback and lucrative benefits, we think its about time that we will witness more exits happening soon. There have been some big exits in the consumer segment with the likes of Myntra, Jabong and Freecharge etc and with more and more international brands venturing into the Indian market the consumer start-up industry will witness further churn and consolidation. We definitely see a huge opportunity for B2B start-ups to grow and be a larger value addition to corporates.Globally, IBM has put capital into venture capital fundsyouve invested in over 50 fundsbut, weve not seen IBM do that in India and south-east Asia. Why is that so?Every start-up has two major requirementsresources and capital. There is no dearth of capital for the right idea and the right team, and there are many investors who are providing this. Where we can differentially add, tremendous value is from giving the much-needed strategic and technology mentorship which further helps the start-up to leverage their money in the right direction. IBM provides access to clients, access to deep technology engagement with our labs and access to mentoring and all of this without the startups giving up any equity for it.In India, you have partnered with Kalaari and Indian Angel Network to work with the start-upsbut this is for mentoring, training and educating and getting them to cloud and cognitive technologies at an early stage. How much leverage do VCs even have in influencing such decisions for their portfolio companies? We are partnering with a select few investors who are actively engaged in supporting and mentoring start-ups in incubating their ideas. At IBM, we believe that we can add value from our deep enterprise technology, our huge spend on research and probably the worlds best access to enterprise clients to help these start-ups and also VCs. We are looking beyond selling our products and solutions to becoming essential to the ecosystem through a whole range of collaborative activitiesincluding helping their portfolio companies get access to IBMs senior leadership team, by jointly working with clients, through activities like design thinking etc with Kalaari and Indian Angel Network.In areas like cloud, start-ups have several competitive optionswhat makes IBM different?IBM has been committed to the overall development of the start-up community and provides startups with free cloud credits on IBM Cloud Solutions worth $24,000 for one year helping emerging companies. We further help them to harness the power of IBM cloud, as well as connect them to IBMs vast global network of clients, consultants, innovation centers, and developers. Several start-ups across India are tapping into IBM cloud to run critical applications and grow their businesses. Both IBM Bluemix, a hybrid cloud development platform and Softlayer, a cloud infrastructure platform, have received a good response in terms of adoption from Indian startups.For start-ups, IBM does not enjoy the mind recall when it comes to looking for potential partners/ How are you working to change that, and given the pace at which IBM operates, can you ever adapt to the requirements, demands, flexibilities that the start-ups require?Indian start-ups have the quality and value to help IBM itself remain agile...so part of this focus is also to help IBMs employeestechnical, sales, business and even functional staff like HR and financelearn and remain abreast with trends. We believe our employees need to stay close to the market and where it is headed and helping in their personal and official capacity to mentor start-ups and help them to innovate. We believe in co-creating and co-innovating with the start-ups and we have an IBM Garage in Bangalore wherein we will have workshops and get start-up get access to a lot of our enterprise customers to build products together.",2016-11-11,SL6pCMJg6ebL1rewMDvayL,"There is a huge opportunity for B2B start-ups to grow, says Nipun Mehrotra, vice-president, growth initiatives, IBM India & south Asia",competitor,11:03,Indian start-ups need to focus more on B2B space: Nipun Mehrotra
-0.55,"All nation-states have armed forces which consist of individuals who are willing to sacrifice their lives for the country. How many corporations in the world, with all their management systems and resources, have managed to create employees with such dedication? This was a question I had raised in my last article. The question that follows is: How does a nation-state build loyalty among its citizens? What can human resources professionals in various organizations learn from this?
				   
				All strong nations have enemies they have fought multiple wars with. This column had earlier referred to the creation of out-groups to effectively consolidate the members of an in-group. Starting a war does a far more effective job of binding the nation together than the creation of an out-group. The famous historian Ian Morris, in his book War! What Is It good For? : Conflict And The Progress Of Civilization From Primates To Robots, has pointed out that, throughout history, by fighting wars, people have created larger, more organized societies that have gone on to be richer. Creation of conflict is integral to all great human movements too. Communism is not about peaceful coexistence of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie but a conflict between them. Organized religions know that the concepts of God and heaven are strong only when there is an equally strong concept of devil and hell as part of their belief systems. Most organizations have a vision of what they aspire to be. But very few have defined what they dont want to be, the enemy they are at war with. Steve Jobs, in the 1984 launch commercial, made it clear that his organization was not interested in peaceful coexistence with other existing technology giants. At the outset he declared a war on technology that was not human friendly (read IBM and Microsoft). That belief is reflected even today in the design of Apple products. This also explains why Jobs and the brand he created continue to have a mass following of dedicated, aggressive fans.From the many wars that nation-states fight, heroes emerge. All strong nations have their national heroesthose who fought for its people, laid down their lives for the flag. Even after their death, nations ensure that these heroes are remembered. The history of nations is filled with stories of their valour. These stories help preserve the memories of the past for many generations of its citizens to come. How many organizations have a well thought out strategy to identify and project their heroes? Is there a process to collect their stories? Is there a mechanism to disseminate the inspiring stories, not just through formal training programmes, but also through water-cooler conversations? Why have nations not redesigned their flags or remixed their national anthems?Management experts who profess that change is the only constant forget the scientific factthe human brain loves status quo. As Stephen Fleming of University College London says, whether its moving house or changing a TV channel, there is a considerable tendency for the human brain to stick with the current situation and choose not to act anew. When any action is repeated, the corresponding neural connections become stronger and over a point of time the brain gets to perform that action without even consciously thinking. The comfort of not thinking too much is disturbed by new stimuli. Political parties, organized religion and even god-men who manage to build strong loyalty with their followers have understood this brain fact. No political party or organized religion changes their symbols. Some of these symbols are thousands of years old. All godmen make sure that not just their attire, even their hairstyles remain constant over decades. And, organized religions have not allowed anyone to change even a comma in their holy books. But many organizations change their logos and other physical expressions at the drop of a hat. Such rebranding exercises are short cuts used by organizational leaders to show that they are making visible changes. Design agencies whose business thrives with every logo change will continue to give plausible arguments to prove that the new font and colours are far superior to the previous ones!Very few professional organizations have exploited the powers of consistency. To do that, organizational leaders should begin with a strong vision that has depth and width. They should know what expressions of that vision are permanent and what facets of that vision could change with the times. From its economic policies to global status to the demographic profile of its citizens, India has changed a lot. But the design of the national flag and the tune of its national anthem has always remained constant. Great nations understand the power of consistency. Nation-states do not try to build strong bonds with their citizens through financial incentives. The bond between all nations and their citizens is emotional. Political leaders know the power of emotional rewards over monetary rewards. And these emotional rewards are amplified through rituals. All nations have several rituals: standing up when the national anthem is sung, hoisting a flag, republic day paradesall add to strengthening the emotional bond between the nation and its citizen.An intuitive understanding of the core concepts of human behaviour has been used by nation leaders to build strong loyalty among its citizens.

				Inflows from foreign and domestic investors have been driving up stocks but they may easily retreat if earnings disappoint. With rising commodity prices and the lingering effects of demonetization, earnings prospects for most companies are anything but rosy, analysts say. Companies, excluding banks and commodities suppliers, are likely to be weighed down by margin pressure as raw material costs have surged from a year earlier, they said.Margins of members of the Nifty index are estimated to narrow by as much as 116 basis points in the three months ended 31 March because of rising input costs, Edelweiss Securities Ltd said in a note released on 7 April. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Infosys Ltd, Bajaj Capital Ltd and Reliance Power Ltd are scheduled to report their fourth quarter earnings on 13 April. Analysts expect quarterly earnings growth to be driven by banks and metals companies. Banks profit growth in the March quarter is likely to be boosted mostly as a result of a favourable base effect. They had reported weak earnings in the year-ago period because of higher provisions following the Reserve Bank of Indias asset quality review. For metals companies, higher commodity prices are expected to support earnings growth.Excluding banks and commodities, profits are likely to contract by 9%, similar to last quarters contraction and significantly lower than the 10% plus profit growth seen in FY15, FY16 and H1FY17. The slowdown in profit will be more pronounced in consumption sectors and cement, Edelweiss said in the 7 April note. The brokerage expects FY17 Nifty earnings per share (EPS) to grow 10%, a marked improvement over the past two years, with Nifty EPS expected at Rs455, Rs555 and Rs660 at the end of FY17, FY18 and FY19, respectively. The brokerage expects Nifty firms to report revenue, operating profit and net profit growth of 15%, 8% and 14%, respectively, in the March quarter. Analysts are worried that the lingering effects of demonetization are still likely to impact companies that are dependent on domestic consumption. Recovery of volume growth is likely to be one of the key concerns in the March quarter earnings, Sanjay Mookim, India equity strategist, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofA-ML), said on Thursday. BofA-ML expects earnings growth to improve from sub-5% in FY17 to 12% in FY18 and 15% in FY19. Indian markets have touched record highs in March and April after Prime Minister Narendra Modis Bharatiya Janata Party won the crucial Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. The Sensex and Nifty rose 11% and 12%, respectively in the March quarter and if earnings fail to deliver, the rally may lose steam.The net income of Sensex companies is likely to grow 9% on an annual basis and 15.3% quarter-on-quarter, Kotak Institutional Equities said in a report dated 7 April.Excluding banks, the brokerage expects an 8.8% year-on-year growth in net income. Weak demand environment, rising raw material costs and increase in discounts may result in an annual decline in net income for automobile firms, while downstream energy firms may be hurt because of lower refining margins, muted growth in volume and the recent decline in global crude oil prices. Kotak estimates Sensex FY18 EPS at Rs1,682 and FY19 EPS at Rs1,972. Its Nifty EPS estimates for FY18 and FY19 are Rs520 and Rs608, respectively. Gautam Duggad, head of research at Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd, said the March quarter may see margin contraction of 50 basis points for firms under the brokerages coverage, excluding financials. We are expecting 23% earnings growth for our universe and 22% CAGR over FY17-19. Expectations for our Motilal Oswal universe net profit growth is 28% and largely led by three sectorsPSU banks, metals, oil and gas. Rest of the universe may decline by 5%, he said. Rakesh Tarway, head of research at Reliance Securities, expects 10% profit growth in the March quarter, reflecting similar trends in the first nine months of the fiscal year. He, however, said commodity prices will have a marginal impact on profitability as firms in many industries like tyres, autos and packaged consumer goods have raised prices. Also, commodity prices have now started stabilizing, which will further insulate margin erosion, he added. According to Deutsche Bank, Sensex firms are expected to post a 9.1% profit growth in the fourth quarter. Excluding banks, Sensex net profit growth is likely to be at 5.4%. Autos are likely to be the biggest drag on Sensex growth, as our analyst has factored in a one-time impact of the BS-III vehicle ban, it said in a note dated 7 April. In the current fiscal year, CRISIL Ratings expects corporate revenue to grow at around 8% on a year-on-year basis. Revival in sectors such as construction equipment, EPC (on improving order book); metals (especially non-ferrous) and sugaron better prices, are expected to aid the improvement, the rating agency said on 3 April.",2017-04-10,SqNSGmPTIfX68gCBjJSgdL,"With rising commodity prices and lingering effects of demonetisation, earnings prospects for most companies for the March quarter are anything but rosy",competitor,01:17,Will corporate earnings disappoint once again?
-0.03,"New Delhi/Singapore: India may turn into a net importer of fuel oil as its state-owned refiners are making multi-billion dollar investments to upgrade their refineries and produce more profitable refined products such as gasoline or diesel.
				   
				India has traditionally been a net exporter of fuel oil, the residue oil left after initial crude refining that is typically used in shipping and power generation. That is about to change. Three state-run energy firms  Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum  plan to spend $20 billion on refinery expansions to add units by 2022 that would process fuel oil into gasoline and diesel, boosting their output to meet growing local demand for transport fuels.Our fuel oil production will be less because everywhere we are going for residue upgrades, said B. Ashok, chairman of the countrys biggest refiner Indian Oil Corp (IOC).Private refiners Reliance Industries and Essar Oil have already invested heavily to build advanced refineries which produce gasoline at the expense of fuel oil.With state refiners now doing the same, India will soon have to sharply raise imports of fuel oil, two traders that participate in the market said. Indias net fuel oil exports averaged 109,000 tonnes from April to September, according to the countrys Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell, and the traders estimate this could flip into a need to raise fuel oil imports as early as late 2017.As a result, the price difference between diesel and fuel oil could narrow further from its current $17.61 a barrel, as Indian shipping fuel demand rises with the governments thrust on the coastal movement of cargoes, considered more cost efficient than road transport.Already, gasoil and fuel oil differentials have started shrinking from about $30 three years ago to $16-$18 now and it is likely to narrow further as refiners are destroying fuel oil to produce gasoil and gasoline, said S. Thangapandian, director at Gulf Petrochem.Indian refiners expansion plans almost coincide with changing shipping fuel norms from 2020 requiring the use of low-sulphur fuels.IOC is the biggest expansion investor, planning to spend Rs50,000 crore ($7.48 billion) by 2022 to raise its refining capacity by about 30% to 2.08 million barrels per day (bpd) including expanding its Panipat refinery in northern India to about 400,000 to 500,000 bpd.HPCL and BPCL plan to spend $11.25 billion to expand refineries and install fuel oil upgrading units, halting fuel oil output in almost all plants.

				Some IT firms have issued profit warnings ahead of the September quarter results, which means things are unlikely to get better anytime soon. Tight-fisted financial services (customers), lower discretionary spending by some and a slow start to the year will likely constrain industry growth to single digits in FY17, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities wrote in a note to clients.Each of these firms reported sluggish growth in the key US market and in the important banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) segment. We expected financial services to be weak though the intensity appears to be far higher.

-0.25,"If the Narendra Modi government is serious about transforming 11 of the 12 ports owned by the Indian government into landlord ports to run them more efficiently under a new law, it would be left with no choice but to privatize the cargo berths run by the state itself.
				   
				But this would be an extremely difficult choice for the government to make, given the strident opposition from port workers unions to such moves.Shipping minister Nitin Gadkari says that the government will introduce the Major Port Authorities Act in Parliaments winter session to govern the 11 ports.Currently, these 11 ports function as trusts under a law framed more than five decades ago called the Major Port Trusts Act, 1963.Kamarajar Port Ltd is the only exception. Kamarajar, which runs the port at Ennore near Chennai, was formed as a company under the Companies Act, 1956, when it was opened in 2001 and operates as a landlord port.The 11 ports owned by the Indian government and run as trusts widely follow a hybrid format of the long obsolete service port model and the preferred landlord model of port management followed globally. This has resulted in a conflict of interest between the port trusts and the private sector, with the former acting both as port regulators and providers of commercial services in many instances.In the service port model, the port authority owns the land and all available assetsfixed and mobileand performs all regulatory and port functions. Here, the port trust is both the landlord and the cargo terminal operator.While the service port model in India was consistent with a centralized economy, it does not fit well in a market-oriented economy, according to experts.In the landlord port model, the publicly governed port authority acts as a regulatory body and as landlord while private companies carry out port operationsmainly cargo-handling activities. Here, the port authority maintains ownership of the port while the infrastructure is leased to private firms that provide and maintain their own superstructure and install own equipment to handle cargo. In return, the landlord port gets a share of the revenue from the private entity.Currently, most major port trusts in India carry out terminal operations as well, resulting in a hybrid model of port governance.The involvement of the port authorities in terminal operations leads to a conflict of interest and works against objectivity. The neutrality of the landlord port authority is a basic requirement for fair competition between port service providers, particularly the terminal operators. The role of the landlord port authority would be to carry out all public sector services and operations such as the award of bids for cargo terminals and dredging.Privatizing cargo berths run by the state-owned ports themselves has, thus, become imperative for a successful transition to the landlord model of port governance, according to a recommendation made by the Indian Ports Association (IPA), a body representing the 12 ports.This recommendation, as the saying goes, is like taking the bull by its horns.Of the total 240 cargo berths operating at major ports (Union government-owned), 66 berths or 28% are on public-private partnership (PPP) model, while 174 berths are state-owned.The PPP potential for the 174 state-owned berths can be gauged on parameters such as traffic projections/cargo growth for the next 10 years (until 2025), with berths registering steady cargo growth of more than 6% becoming preferred choices for privatization, the IPA has suggested in a report to the ministry.Currently, 102 of the 174 state-owned berths load multiple or general cargo. To build financial returns, berths with dedicated cargo have a greater potential for PPP.Besides, mechanized berths as well as berths with scope for mechanization have more potential for PPP since it ensures larger cargo handling and throughput.Berths in ports with overall strong financials, for instance, with over 20% net profit, have a higher potential for PPP. This would be reassuring for prospective investors interested in higher returns, the IPA stated.PPP cargo berths/terminals at major ports have so far been awarded through the revenue-sharing modethe bidder willing to share the most from his annual revenue wins the dealsince these projects were viable on a stand-alone basis. About 10 cargo berths have the potential to undergo PPP through the revenue-sharing model, the IPA wrote in its report.However some of the berths with potential for PPP may be constrained by revenue uncertainties. New models should be explored for such berths such as viability-gap funding, annuity and management contracts, it added.The viability gap funding (VGF) model can be used if revenue from the berth is inadequate to service the capital expenditure. In such cases, a one-time VGF can be provided by the central government to make the PPP investment viable.The annuity model can be used to remove traffic and revenue risk for PPP projects. In such cases, the port authority can pay a fixed semi-annual fee to the private operator to compensate him for capital cost and operational expenses, along with an assured percentage of returns.The private developer, though, will not have the right to any charges levied on cargo. A variation of this is the hybrid annuity model wherein a 40% capital support is provided by the government and annuities are replaced by fixed cash flows to meet the cash outflows of the private developer.If a state-owned cargo berth has no potential for PPP, it can enter into an operation and management (O&M) contract for operations management with O&M fees charged annually.While there is a logical basis for privatizing the existing state-run cargo berths to facilitate the move to a landlord concept of port ownership, it is anybodys guess how this will actually pan out.P.

				The US administration said on Monday it had drafted an executive order to overhaul the H1B work-visa programme that software services firms based in India use to send skilled workers to the US.Alongside, a draft legislation, which among other things, calls for more than doubling the minimum salary of H1B visa holders to $130,000, was introduced in the US House of Representatives. The draft bill aims to make it difficult to replace US employees with foreign workers and experts say it is likely to deal a body blow to companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd in its present shape.ALSO READ | H1B visa reform bill introduced in US, minimum pay doubled to $130,000If implemented, the reforms may force TCS, Infosys and Wipro to make fundamental changes in their business strategies, including hiring more American workers and raising salaries they pay to employees working on client sites in the USmoves that analysts say will erode operating margins by as much as 3 percentage points.It is an adverse development, but I suspect the minimum wage limit will not rise beyond $100,000. There will be strong lobbying to curb it at that level, said Apurva Prasad, a  research analyst at HDFC Securities. Assuming the minimum wage is fixed at $100,000, the tierI Indian IT companies could take a hit of around 150-300 bps on their operating margins. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. The draft legislation also proposes to reserve 20% of the H1B visas allocated annually for firms that have 50 or fewer employees.Stocks of Indian software exporters plunged on Tuesday. TCSs shares fell 4.47%, Infosyss declined 2% and Wipros 1.62%.ALSO READ | The message from H1B visa reformsAn increase in minimum annual wage to $110,000 for H1B workers may hurt TCSs gross margin by 230 basis points and Infosyss by 170 bps, according to a December note prepared by Investec Securities. The average annual wage for a TCS employee on a H1B visa is $69,658, according to the note. Its higher for Infosy at $79,176.The contentious H1B visas are given to foreign nationals in specialty occupations that generally require higher education, who according to the US government rules include engineers, computer programmers and scientists. The government awards 65,000 such visas to foreigners every year.TCS declined to comment on the development. Infosys and Wipro didnt immediately respond to a request for comment.While tech firms claim they use the H1B visas to hire highly skilled workers in areas that lack top talent, the fact that a majority of the visas are awarded to outsourcing firms from India has drawn criticism from US politicians, who claim companies such as TCS and Infosys misuse the work visa programme to bring low-level IT workers into the US. Around 70% of H1B visas were given to workers from India, The New York Times reported in November 2015, citing  the US Department of Homeland Security.ALSO READ | H1B visas: Business as usual after short-term flapIf skills arent available in the US and per law you cant bring workers in then either the job will remain undone or the job will be shifted to India or some other location outside the US, R.

				On Monday night, Cyrus Mistryunceremoniously dumped as group chairman two months agoended his high-decibel bid to hang around at operating companies that had called shareholder meetings to oust him.But Mistrys resignation from those boards is perhaps only a recognition that he was going to lose the proxy fight. Ratan Tata, who engineered the coup against Mistry at holding company Tata Sons Ltd, wont be resting easy. The founding familys tenuous control of the $103 billion conglomerate cant be taken for granted.With Mistry promising to shift the battleground, a far messier skirmish lies ahead. The risk is no longer of a split in the empire; now, just by being patient and uncompromising, Mistry could in theory get all of it.The ousted chairman says he will take the fight to a platform that can uphold the rule of law. Courts, however, are unlikely to get involved in deciding whether Ratan Tata kept meddling in the operating companies after handing over the reins four years ago.Also read: The options before Cyrus MistrySimilarly, Mistrys insinuations of insider trading might baffle the securities regulator. It would be one thing to show that trustees of Tata Trusts, philanthropic institutions that control two-thirds of Tata Sons, asked and got unpublished, price-sensitive information about publicly listed units, but quite another to prove that any of them enriched themselves or others.Alleged financial fraud and violation of foreign-exchange laws at Tata Groups joint-venture airline with Malaysias AirAsia Bhd might pose a more serious challenge, and even ethical lapses that arent necessarily crimes would serve their purpose. If the fog is thick enough to keep the conglomerate on front pages of newspapers for all the wrong reasons, an irritated government might be forced to intervene in Tata Trusts on the grounds that they have gone astray from their charitable mission.Assume Ratan Tata is no longer able to control Tata Trusts. Then, as the second-largest investor in Tata SonsMistrys family owns more than 18%the deposed leader gets to shape the groups destiny.It wont be that easy. If Ratan Tata, whos back as interim chairman of the holding company, can quickly find a strong successor to look after the empire, he can regain his footing. That would allow him to broach a compromise from a position of strength. Theres already a proposal to list Tata Sons. Citigroup Inc. drew up a detailed plan some time back. Implementing it would unlock value for Mistrys shareholding, too.Whether the deal works depends on Mistrys risk preference: The longer he drags on the conflict, the more the loss of wealth for all shareholders, including himself. But Mistry, 48, has one advantage over his 78-year-old-adversary: time.The onus to settle the feud is on Ratan Tata, and the younger man must know that, too.

				According to BNP Paribas, TCS will report a 6% increase in dollar revenue in the current financial year, down from last years 7%. Even this projection looks a tad generous, and, according to Mint calculations, TCS runs the risk of less than 5.6% growth.Put simply, TCS, for the first time since it clocked 5.4% growth in 2009-10, could add less than $1 billion in incremental revenue this year. And that could ring alarm bells at TCS, which ended with $16.5 billion in revenue in the financial year to March last year.TCS will report its fiscal third quarter earnings on Thursday.Accenture Plc., a firm about twice as large as TCS, recorded 6% growth in the year ended August (Accenture follows a September-August financial year). Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solution Corp., which was about half of TCSs size of $6 billion in 2009when Natarajan Chandrasekaran became the CEO of TCSwill still manage 9% growth to end the year with at least $13.5 billion in revenue (Cognizant follows the calendar year as financial year).At the heart of TCSs underperformance, which started manifesting in July 2014, is its inability to build a stronger consulting practice and the managements reluctance to buy small firms for technologies like design consulting and data analytics and automation platform providers. TCS also faces some client-specific challenges, all of which have led to low growth. Still, over the last two years, this has not stopped TCS management from claiming the company is making itself future-ready. The biggest concern for stakeholders is if TCS will continue to chug along in 2017-18 and disappoint with depressing growth numbers. For now, the signals are not bright. With this as the backdrop, Mint puts the spotlight on five things to watch in TCSs third quarter earnings on 12 January:1. Revenue growth and management commentary on the demand outlookBNP Paribas expects TCSs dollar revenue to inch up 0.3% to $4.39 billion in the October-December period on a sequential basis. Most brokerages do not expect any significant uptick in growth in the current quarter, either. Nonetheless, management commentary on demand for companys services from clients, especially in Europe and US, will be crucial.2. Pressure on profitability Since January last year, TCSs operating margins have been under pressure. Its 26.1% Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin at the end of March quarter was 54 basis points less than margins at the end of October-December period of 2014. The companys margins further contracted to 25.1% at the end of June quarter, and improved to 26% at the end of July-September period. Now, as commoditized deals come under further pricing pressure, traditional levers like going slow on hiring will not be enough to offset the gradual decline in profitability. For this reason, most analysts are doubtful if TCS will be able to operate in the managements stated guidance of 26-28%.3. Performance in the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) and retail sectorsAccentures performance in the September-November period and management commentary suggests some weakness in business from clients in the BFSI sector. This spells trouble for a company like TCS, which generates more than 40% of its business from BFSI. Retail segment too has seen a decline, and for this reason, management commentary on BFSI and retail, which together bring about 54% of its total revenue, will be eyed.4. Impact of US bill seeking to increase pay to employees with H1B visasEarlier this month, a legislation demanding that outsourcing firms pay at least $100,000 a year to employees who work in the US was introduced in the Congress. Analysts and industry executive believe it could take up to a year before the US makes this a law. Washingtons demand that companies like TCS pay a minimum wage of $100,000 to employees with H1B visas could hurt profitability by 300-500 basis points, according to a 9 January note by JPMorgan Chase and Co. analyst Viju George. Management commentary on this will be watched.5. Weak sectors and geographiesTCS does not expect growth to rebound in Japan. The company claims to have arrested any loss of business from its UK-based insurance platform Diligenta. Growth from telecoms segment continue to be wobbly. Together, underperformance by the three units eroded about 2% growth from the companys 11.9% growth on constant currency basis in 2015-16.

-0.31,"For the past two decades, every time the management of Dabur India Ltd met to finalize a new product, it ended up also debating whether to stick to Ayurveda or to focus on non-Ayurvedic products.
				   
				The decision to launch non-Ayurvedic products came 113 years after S.K. Burman set up Dabur in 1884 in Kolkata. In 1997, the home-grown Ayurvedic products maker launched Project STARS (Strive to Achieve Record Successes) to accelerate growth through diversification. It launched Real, a fruit-based beverage.Ayurveda cannot take Dabur far, the Burmans were convinced. So, the family that popularized Ayurveda in India moved away from its core strength.Over the next 19 years, the companys focus intensified so much on non-Ayurveda products that just the food business accounted for about 11% of its Rs8,436 crore revenue in the year to March 2016 and 18% of domestic sales came from foods. Not just food, it launched a number of non-Ayurvedic products in segments like personal care and home care as well. Overall, about 40% of its sales came from non-Ayurvedic products in the year to March 2016. The wheel of change was set for a spin. But then came yoga-guru-turned-businessman Baba Ramdev. Under his company Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd, he launched a range of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) based on Ayurveda. In recent months, ever since Patanjali started aggressive advertising on television, it has challenged companies such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), Colgate-Palmolive (India) Ltd, Nestlé India Ltd that compete in Indias Rs3.2 trillion-a-year consumer packaged goods market.Theres more. Going by Ramdevs projections, Patanjali will cross Rs10,000 crore in revenue in fiscal year 2017from Rs5,000 crore in FY16. This is more than what brokerage firm Morgan Stanley India Co. Pvt Ltd projected as Dabur Indias revenue in FY17Rs 9,630 crore.Besides, Dabur started feeling the pinch as sales of its honey (a product that is estimated to have more than 65% market share) started declining earlier this year as people  bought Patanjalis cheaper variety.The Burmans realized that Dabur needs to get back to basics and return to its coreAyurveda.The future, says Dabur India chief executive officer (CEO) Sunil Duggal, will be driven by Ayurvedic products. With this validation (success of Patanjali), we are more committed to staying and growing the natural equities and not string into other domains. So it provides a lot more focus to the companys activities and a lot more opportunities to grow within spaces that we are familiar with rather than to get into unfamiliar spaces which obviously would be much riskier, he adds.There were reasons why Dabur was unsure about sticking to only Ayurvedic products.The Burmans wanted to build an empire outside Indiaacross the Middle East, Africa, Europe, North America and South Asia, which together accounts for 32% of Daburs consolidated sales at present. Across all these countries, Ayurveda was never a popular or saleable concept. So the shift was only  natural.Although Dabur was probably the only Indian company that was selling products made of Ayurvedic formulations nationwide, it was unsure about how far it could take Ayurveda. Till recently, the ability of Ayurvedic products to go deeper was under some question. Ayurveda can go deep in certain areas, not all. Like skin care, it may not go that deep. But we are now beginning to question that paradigm. Now we are far more convinced that Ayurveda can go far deeper in many areas than what we thought earlier, says Duggal.Faith vs evidence A couple of months ago, the company revamped its marketing communications with a new taglineScience-based Ayurveda. So far, it was celebrate life. All our advertisements and other communications are now based on one themeScience of Ayurveda. There have been changes in packaging and marketing communications as well. We need to be relevant to the youth, says K.K. Chutani, executive director (marketing) at Dabur India. Besides, in February this year it tied up with e-commerce marketplace Snapdeal to set up an e-store for its Ayurveda products called LiveVEDA. Chutani believes, e-commerce was an imperative for Daburs future.The rationale behind Daburs new communication is its history. The Burmans have been marketing Ayurveda for more than 130 years. But it cant just bank on its history or legacy. The platform that we are going to leverage is the science-based Ayurveda, backed by research, validation and hard evidences. It will appeal to a lot of people who may not believe in faith-based Ayurveda (unlike Ramdevs followers), adds Chutani. Emergence of Patanjali, believes CEO Duggal, is a blessing in disguise for Dabur. Patanjali products are sold primarily based on peoples faith in Ramdev. His marketing and Patanjalis well-spread retail presence has already, and probably would, convert a lot of non-Ayurdevic product users into regular users of Ayurvedic or herbal products. There has been some learning from Ramdev. To my mind, he has given a big impetus to Ayurveda and his large number of followers are driving it. The desire for Ayurvedic solutions runs very deep in Indian psychology. It would be very silly of us not to take advantage of that, says Duggal, who joined Dabur in 1995 and became CEO in 2002.By 2020, Dabur targets Ayurvedic products to constitute more than 75% of its sales in India, from around 60% now.To focus more on Ayurvedic formulations, the company is doubling its herb cultivation. By March 2017, Dabur will have 3,800 acres for medicinal herb farming, up from about 2,000 acres at present that it has developed during past two decades. It also has a greenhouse at Pantnagar in Uttarakhand. The company will be spending Rs600 crore in back-end supply chain. The medicinal farming will be spread across eight states in India and Nepal, and engage about 2,500 farmers, up from 1,200 at present.We have been marrying the age-old Ayurvedic heritage and traditions with cutting-edge scientific prowess. We have a strong in-house research wing that follows a bush-to-brand approach. We have our in-house nursery, which grows several rare herbs that go into various products. Dabur is probably the only company which is involved in both classical or ethical as well as OTC (over-the-counter) formulation research for close to 40 years now, says J.L.N. Sastry, head (research and development, Ayurveda) at Dabur India. In a note on 21 September, Citi Research, a division of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., said, Dabur claims to focus on science-based high quality Ayurveda products with an emphasis on R&D, which makes it well positioned to ride this wave.Countering PatanjaliIn May, Dabur launched an advertisement for its honey which said it was approved by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) that ensures safety. Patanjalis honey does not have FSSAI approval. The ad came on the back of a drop in sales of Dabur honey at the beginning of the year. The company has been selling honey since 1994  and dominates the market with close to a two-thirds share.However, Patanjali honey directly hit Dabur primarily because of the price difference. Daburs honey was priced about 40% higher than Patanjalis. We got things corrected through offers and other things. We find people who switched are returning. But there is a section of people, financially stressed, who may not come back. But we have to deal with that. We cant have all things for all people, says Duggal. The company also launched brand extensions like honey fruit spreads.Interestingly, in an earlier Mint interview, Ramdev said his rivalry was with multinational companies (MNCs) not the home-grown ones like Dabur. But a Patanjali spokesperson said that even if Dabur is an Indian company, it has no right to loot people. Products are overpriced. Be it an Indian company or MNC, it should operate ethically, and products should be economical. With Patanjali, backed by Baba Ramdevs marketing, the market for Ayurvedic and herbal or natural products has expanded, which certainly is an opportunity for everyone, he added.Commenting on FSSAI certification, or the lack of it, the spokesperson said that Patanjalis honey had passed all required tests and is safe. As honey is a products that is consumed both as a medicine and a food item, FSSAI approval is not mandatory, he added.Besides honey, even Daburs toothpaste sales were impacted but Duggal dismisses concerns about it by saying the category has not been growing. In fact, Dabur Chyawanprash, the market leader with an estimated 65% share, also faced stiff competition after Patanjali started mass marketing Chyawanprash at a much lower price last year. But its impact was not severe, maintains Duggal.However, Dabur narrowed the price gap with Patanjali and tried establishing Chyawanprash, a predominantly winter product, as a product relevant for others seasons like monsoon through intense promotional activities. With Patanjali coming in, the category might grow better. He (Ramdev) will convert a lot of non-users into Chyawanprash users. He could be a good ambassador for Chyawanprash, adds Duggal.In a note on 21 September, Citi Research  said, Dabur has been managing competitive intensity well through brand building (strong digital push), value-added variants or formats and by reducing price premiums in segments like honey with price-offs and promotions... Reducing the pricing premium with extra weight (such as 1.25 kg for the price of 1 kg) and / or price-offs, upping the ante on honey brand building and the extension to value-added variants and formats are examples of a well-rounded approach to tackle the aggressive competition from Patanjali.Daburs challenge, according to Sunita Sachdev, an analyst with UBS Securities India Pvt. Ltd, is to re-invent its brand and make itself relevant to the current crop of consumers. Getting back to its rootsAyurvedais very appropriate, said Sachdev.Peer pressureDabur India isnt under pressure from Patanjali alone. Competition in the domestic market in the last few years has increased as almost every packaged goods companyhome-grown and multinationalhas rolled out products that are herbal or natural. The trend has been triggered largely by Patanjalis success and the opportunity the category offers for premiumization of products.In recent years, HUL and Colgate, local units of MNCs, have ramped up their portfolios with premium Ayurvedic products in key brands. Home-grown Emami Ltd and Himalaya Drug Co., which have been selling herbal or Ayurvedic products for long, have gained from their traditional herbal positioning. These companies are extending brands into new and emerging segments to improve profitability. And all of them are trying to expand. While Emami bought Ayurvedic hair oil and shampoo brand Kesh King from SBS Biotech Ltd in June 2015 for Rs1,651 crore, HUL acquired Kerala-based Indulekha hair oil brand for Rs330 crore earlier this year to boost its presence in Ayurvedic space.Interestingly, Dabur was the first to tap the hair oil space with a herbal product Dabur Amla hair oil back in 1940 and expanded its hair care portfolio in early 1990s with Vatika brand. But it failed to leverage the advantage of an early entrant.Admits Duggal, We never thought products like shampoo can be marketed as an Ayurvedic product. With recent developments in the market, we are now thinking of launching Ayurvedic shampoo. Some of our bets will work, some may not. But Ayurveda can go beyond the imagination of people.Herbal or Ayurvedic still constitutes a very small part of personal care market in India. According to a research report (September 2015) by UBS Securities India, herbal products comprise 6-7% of the personal care products market, but the volume is growing at about twice the segment average. The report estimated herbal to grow to about 10% of the segment by FY20 as the trend accelerates.Duggal, however, believes Dabur has the advantage of being a company that has been the original marketer of Ayurveda in India. There are differences between Ayurveda and herbal. Herbal is a step before Ayurveda. Ayurveda is a completely different ball game, he adds.Distressed economyBesides increasing competition, slow growth is a serious worry for Dabur too.In April-June 2016 quarter, the companys sales grew just 1.2%. In the quarter ended March 2016, it reported a 4% increase in volume in the domestic market compared to a 7% growth in the preceding quarter. Post results, the management had painted a cautious outlook for FY17. It expects things to get better only in the second half of FY17. The key challenge that we are facing today is that theres a radical downward shift in the overall consumption of consumer goods because of tapering of the stimulus that was provided by the earlier government and has not been taken forward by the current government. The current government is following an investment-led growth and not consumption-led growth that has triggered a consumption stress, primarily in rural market, which was the prime driver of growth between 2008 and 2014, says Duggal.A double-digit growth is very unlikely in the next one-two years for the packaged consumer goods firms. I am hoping for 6-8%. I never expected this sharp a decline in consumption. I knew it will come down but not from 12% to 3-4%, says Duggal, adding that consumption will improve in  a gradual manner starting 2018.Two consecutive poor monsoons also hurt consumption. A relatively good monsoon, coupled with the seventh pay commission money in the system, is likely to provide some impetus that would help consumption recover. However, the picture is not that dismal as packaged goods companies like Dabur are enjoying high marginsthanks to stability in commodity prices resulting in low input costs. Its a good thing. But the downside of the combination of high margin and low demand will typically lead to a lot of pricing activities. Reduction of prices in some cases and aggressive promotions are obvious. Well have to deal with that aspect. Some of the margins may be passed on to the consumers, adds Duggal.Rewriting ruralAbout 45% of Dabur Indias domestic revenue comes from rural markets and, as mentioned above, consumption in rural markets has not been growing for the last few years. Naturally, the company not only stopped expanding its distribution network in rural areas, in the last one year it also stepped out of certain markets to minimize its risk.Thats not all. It also reorganized its sales force in rural markets. The company hired about 1,000 people to sell its products in villages starting this April. Earlier, village sales representatives were under the payrolls of third-party human resource companies. Dabur is shelling out the same amount of money but the village sales representatives are earning more as their salaries are not being shared by third-party firms. They are the sons of the soil. They understand these markets. With them coming on our rolls, productivity and sales have improved. Rural markets will start growing again. Well ramp up distribution and marketing to capture the growth prospects thats expected in the second half of the year, adds Duggal. Dabur typically pays Rs2 lakh a year and incentives to the village sales representatives.Tweaks in distribution and go-to-market efforts, according to the Citi Research note, will help Dabur improve productivity of the enhanced footprint, besides doctor detailing could be a key driver for healthcare offerings.For urban markets, the company, in June, divided its portfolio in four pieces home and personal care, healthcare, OTC medicines, and food and beverages. Theres a separate sales team for each of these segments. Earlier there were three segmentsOTC, FMCG and food. The change is aimed at bringing a deeper focus on individual segments.Dabur products now reach around 5.3 million outlets. In comparison, HUL reaches about 6.3 million of the estimated 8 million retail outlets in India. Cigarette-to-shampoo maker ITC Ltd reaches to around 4.3 million retail stores.Advantage spreadDabur has a unique mix of diverse growth enginesjuices, healthcare, skincare, international business and home care. And, it has four cash cowshair oils, digestives, health supplements and toothpastes. The growth engines, noted Morgan Stanley in a report, can use cash cows to generate consistent, superior growth. Dabur has the ability to launch highly differentiated product offerings across its product portfolio, catalyzed by the recent success of Patanjali, increase in disposable incomes, lifestyle changes and increasing awareness of Ayurvedic products, it report added.OTC products are seen as the most exciting growth opportunity for Dabur, backed by the companys brand strength, knowledge of Ayurveda, doctor advocacy, and product heritage. We expect a slew of launches over the next few quarters with a focus on daily healthcare and lifestyle ailments. This business also has one of the best gross profit margin profiles. We believe growth will inflect as consumers perceive these products as being efficacious for overall health and wellness and likely balance out the adverse impact of rapid changes in lifestyles currently under way, said the Morgan Stanley analysis.Eyes on buysAcquisition was one of the routes that helped Dabur grow, mainly in markets outside India. The company, which has more than Rs2,200 crore of cash on its balance sheet, is now looking for buyouts in India to ensure faster growth. In the last few years, organic growth has been slow and Dabur has not made a pitch to acquire any firm. The companys deals team is already working on a few targets. Despite the fact that the management is open to spending about Rs1,000 crore on acquisitions, Dabur is only looking for small buys. I like small brands that are scalable, primarily regional brands with national relevance. I hope to close at least one deal by end of this financial year, says Duggal.Dabur is looking at Ayurvedic brands and brands in the adjacent areas. It is unlikely to buy any company that is in the generic products space as that could conflict with its existing product offering. There are a few generic products, but buying a generic product maker would be replication. Thats one of the reasons why we did not buy Zandu (which got sold to Emami in 2008), he adds.Likely acquisition targets could be companies that make branded proprietary products in areas such as digestion, cough and cold, fever, lifestyle disease management, among others. However, there are not many targets in the market.Acquisitions make sense. Despite high valuations, Emamis acquisition of Kesh King and HULs Indulekha buyout were relatively successful, says Sachdev of UBS Securities.Its key acquisitions in India include Balsara Hygiene Products Ltd, maker of Babool toothpaste and Odonil air freshner, in 2005 and female skin care products maker Fem Care Pharma in 2008. Over the years, some of the brands it acquired from these two firms, such as Fem, Babool and Odonil, have crossed the Rs100-crore sales mark. Even its international business has primarily grown through acquisitions post- 2010. International woes About 32% of Daburs consolidated revenue comes from international markets by selling personal care products across the Middle East, Africa, Europe, North America and South Asia. The Middle East is the biggest market that accounts for 33% of the companys international sales, followed by Africa (22%), Americas (17%), Asian markets excluding India (17%) and Europe (11%).But companies, including Dabur, have been facing challenges in these markets mainly due to political uncertainties, currency fluctuations and falling oil prices. Low oil prices have led to a downward pressure on oil producing economies with governments adopting austerity measures, curbing spending on major projects and reducing subsidies which has eroded disposable incomes. Most of the markets have witnessed sharp depreciation in their currencies which has led to lower value realizations in our business. Geo-political turmoil in MENA (Middle East and North Africa) has, to a large extent, impacted markets such as Syria, Libya, Yemen, Iraq and others where there has been a reduction in consumption due to large scale displacement of human population, says Mohit Malhotra, CEO of Dabur International Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dabur India.Dabur, however, will continue to invest in these marketsin brands, distribution and building local supply chains to ensure better pricing and margin.Also see | Our aim is to make Dabur a multinational from India: Amit BurmanIn July, Dabur India acquired Discaria Trading, registered in South Africa, for just Rs4,679 (1,000 South African rand). It was a small but important acquisition. With this, the company got an entry to South Africaa market it has been trying enter for a long time. Dabur already has two manufacturing plantsone each in Nigeria and Egypt.Africa has been on the radar of Indian packaged goods and personal care firms for the past few years primarily because of projected consumer spending. Consulting firm McKinsey and Co., in a report in 2010, projected consumer spending in Africa to double to $1.8 trillion by 2020. Dabur made its first foreign acquisition in 2010 by buying Hobi Kozmetik Group, a leading personal care products company in Turkey, for $69 million. It also acquired US-based Namaste Laboratories for $100 million in the same year. Our twin acquisitions took place almost a decade after our entry into the overseas markets and these acquisitions have helped us further consolidate our overseas business. We have emerged as the Indian-born FMCG transnational entirely through the organic route, says Malhotra. Prior to these acquisitions, the company primarily sold hair oil under Dabur Amla and Vatika brands in the overseas markets. Now, its international portfolio is dominated by products it got from acquisitions. According to Citi Research, hair oil accounted for about 39% of sales from international markets together, followed by shampoo (14%), hair cream (13%), oral care (11%), skin care (7%) and styling products (about 12%) in FY16, contrary to hair oil contributing about 93% to the business in FY06.Namaste business has been steady and we believe local manufacturing and distribution in Africa should provide a fillip to the business from 2017 onwards. Local manufacturing would enhance the price competitiveness of Namaste products that are currently imported and thus at a significant price premium. Steps to enhancing sales and distribution for Namaste products in sub-Saharan Africa should help Dabur deepen its presence. For the other overseas operations, management talks of a somewhat lower adverse forex impact vs the previous year. Geopolitical or economic issues in Saudi Arabia and parts of North Africa remain, but the companys foray into Iran could be a new positive driver from second half of FY17, Citi Research said in the 21 September report.Going forward, Dabur will deepen presence in many of the countries in Africa, primarily where it already has presence, and across markets in South Asia. Two markets where it sees a better future are Myanmar and Iran. The company already has a presence in Myanmar, and it is setting up a factory in Iranprobably the last big market thats left unexplored due to blockadeto start selling products early next year.We are open to exploring inorganic opportunities to fill gaps in our existing portfolio and geographic presence, says Malhotra, adding that the company has not earmarked any amount for buys and can fund acquisitions through internal accruals and debt. Sachdev of UBS Securities, however, says there is risk in the international business. Theres also sub-scale which hinders their ability to generate quicker higher returns, she adds.Analysts darlingCompetition may be stiff and growth may be slow but Dabur India is considered an attractive investment proposition in consumer staples by equity analysts.Over FY16-18, noted Morgan Stanley in its report on 25 April, Dabur will become the most expensive staples stock from one of the cheapest now. It added, Even as the stock has outperformed the Sensex by 6% over the past six months, it has underperformed peers like Godrej Consumer Products Ltd, HUL and Marico Ltd by 10-30% on concerns of rising competition, especially from Patanjali Ayurved.Brokerage firm CLSA, in a report on 29 April, noted that the Dabur stock was up 11% in the past three months and it will continue to outperform as growth visibility is improving.",2016-10-23,UgUhTXwedPBnKgK0sgqIiO,"Feeling the heat from Baba Ramdevs Patanjali Ayurved, Dabur returns to its roots: Ayurveda ",competitor,23:42,Dabur goes back to basics to take on Patanjali

-0.98,"One of the authors of this article built a speech recognition engine in the early 1990s. It was built on a special purpose digital signal processor, in a lab that was especially dedicated to this project. The engine required two days of training, could recognize a single voice and had a vocabulary of close to 50 words. It was close to state-of-the-art at that time. 
Cut to the present. All smartphones today have the ability to recognize speech. No special hardware is needed. Training needs are minimalthe technology works straight out of the box and can be trained to recognize anybodys voice. And the vocabulary is infinite. The phenomenon that enabled this rapid change is the advancement in processing power, storage and communication. Computing speed is doubling every year, as per Moores law, which predicted an exponential growth in the number of transistors in integrated circuits within processors. Similar stories of transformation can be told about storage and communication. Todays technology road maps have gone beyond the classical Moores law with the advent of distributed computing, rapid development of smart devices packed with sensors and the Internet of things.While we have seen a lot of technology transformations over the last 20 years, what is even more fascinating is the expectation that the next two decades will see technology innovations being rolled out at a faster pace than ever before. Technological change will continue to be exponential. Noted inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil argues that there is even an exponential growth in the rate of exponential growth! What this means is that in the 21st century, we wont see a 100 years of technological progress. We will see 20,000 years of progress at todays rate.FIVE BIG TECHNOLOGY THEMES FOR THE FUTUREWhile there are many technological advancements taking place all around us, we think five big themes will play a very important role in defining the next 20 years.Gene is the new Byte: In the grand scheme of things, we are all very similar. In fact, 99.9% of our genes are identical. Its the last 0.1% that makes all the difference! In April 2003, the human genome was completely mapped for the first time. The rate of reduction in the cost to sequence a persons genome has outpaced even Moores law, from $10 million in 2008 to just $1,000 today. Going forward, this cost is likely to continue dropping and in the near future, we would be able get our complete genome mapped and stored in USB drives or on the cloud for a mere $100. This will open the doors to fantastic possibilities for preventive healthcare and personalized medical treatment. Genome mapping has large implications for agriculture as well, with possibilities like the development of more productive and disease resistant crops, or the creation of diet plans tailored to suit our respective heredities!Disruptions in energy: The end of energy as we know is near. Advancements in technology have reduced the cost of solar energy to 45 cents a watt from $100 a watt in 1970. Interestingly, during this period, other forms of energy have seen a 16-fold increase in price. The average cost of solar panels fell by 75% between 2009 and 2014, and is expected to decline by another 25% by 2018. Solar power tariffs are expected to reach grid parity in India in 2018, and then go below that level. Battery technology is advancing rapidly to help store this energy. Polymer and hybrid-flow battery technology being developed currently will increase energy density, increasing the storage capacity of a given physical space. It is likely that in the near future, many of us will be able to generate, store and use clean solar energy right off our rooftops, at a cost cheaper than buying electricity from the grid. With smart micro-grids, one will even be able to sell excess energy back, creating a truly distributed energy network.Advancements in material science: In Star Trek, the science fiction television show, the crew on-board starships used food replicators to synthesize any meal they wanted while travelling through space. This surreal concept is now inching towards reality. 3D printers have come a long way since the 1980s, and are soon going to be affordable enough for educational and residential usage. Nanomaterials with unique optical, electronic and mechanical properties are driving the next generation of consumer electronics, filtration systems and biomedical treatment. Similarly, advances in biodegradable plastics augur well for environmentally friendly packaging in the future. Ubiquitous digital connectivity: Ubiquitous digital connectivity has been elusive so far although it has been widely talked about by policymakers and technologists. But it is inevitable. Digital access will become more and more affordable as prices reduce. Consumers will increasingly bracket digital connectivity among needs as basic as roti, kapda and makaan (bread, clothes and home), and will allocate a larger share of wallet for it. Digital governance platforms will help governments significantly improve the distribution of subsidy programmes targeted at people with limited means and lastly, corporates that stand to benefit heavily from a burgeoning consumer class may make the economic trade-offs differently. AI and robotics revolution: Artificial intelligence (AI) is already a reality today with Google Search, Siri and IBM Watson being some examples. Todays AI tools excel at complex analytics. In 2016, AI mastered Go, widely considered the most difficult strategy game. However, it struggles with cognitive tasks that a two-year-old can dofor example, knowing the difference between the pictures of a cat and a dog. Genetic algorithms being developed today will strengthen AIs cognitive reasoning capabilities. Limitations on raw computational power will soon be overcome, powering AI tools to do what human brains can. Meanwhile, rapid advances in robotics, such as the development of bio-hybrid robots built using living tissue, are starting to take shape. We are on the cusp of an explosion in AI and robotics, which could make androids a reality in the near future.The interplay between these technology megatrends has the potential to significantly change the world as we know it today. Imagine solar energy-powered 3D printers being airlifted to disaster zones to provide food to people trapped there. Or, a mother in Salem, Tamil Nadu, getting her sons genome mapped, and later getting on a video conference with a New York-based doctor to seek allergy treatment options.Fundamental paradigm shifts driven by accelerating technologyChange in technology fundamentally shifts the production possibility frontier. Every time we hit the law of diminishing returns, newer technology provides a breakthrough. In addition to fundamental shifts in the cost curvewhich are a giventechnology expands the gamut of the possible by significantly altering core trade-offs. Let us look at three conventional business and economic trade-offs, which are getting busted:Two-way real-time interactions versus one-way outreach: In the past, businesses could either focus on rich information tailored to a niche market or reach out to a larger market that sacrificed richness for the additional reach. However, today, two-way, real-time communication with rich and relevant content has become a reality. Digital technology enables access to global platforms for buying and selling, marketing and financing from anywhere. Advanced analytics, combined with mobile technology, is allowing companies to target each consumer individually, across their entire client base. For example, if it is raining, your regular coffee shop can tempt you to brave the weather and visit it by offering you a promotional scheme on your favourite drink, through an app on your smartphone.Supply and demand mismatch: With the shift towards elimination of bespoke hardware, and value migrating to software, it is possible today to match supply with demand almost perfectly. Increased access and connectivity via technology is driving a revolution in the sharing economy as well. Sharing is not new to us. The barter system has been in place for centuries, long before money was invented. Today, we are not only sharing digital information, we are also sharing physical things like homes and vehicles with each other, using digital market places.Scale versus cost: Technology is not only rapidly reducing servicing costs, it is also increasingly enabling businesses to move to an opex spend model, from the erstwhile capex heavy approach. This is helping expand firms reach to new consumers at a faster rate than ever before. For example, consumers with very low deposits can be served economically in an opex spend model, telecom base stations no longer need minimum efficient scale, retail distribution can be customized economically at a micro-market level, and 3D printing can significantly change manufacturing scale. SPECIFIC IMPLICATIONS OF ACCELERATING TECHNOLOGY FOR INDIARadical innovation with next-generation technology architecture:The Internet has served as the main platform for disruption across industries. Its architecture is decentralized, modular and stacked. Lower down the stack, the focus is on scale and efficient utilization, for example, server capacity. Higher up the stack, however, the focus is on content related to user needs and innovation. This stack-based architecture eliminates the trade-off between efficiency and innovation, as higher-layer innovators can rent scale from lower-level platform providers to conduct experiments at lower costs. This is already a reality in our lives. Case in point, Uber, which uses a stacked architecture comprising GPS, Google Maps, electronic payments and connected smartphonesnone of which it ownsto offer a disruptive and consumer-friendly transportation solution.In India, we are witnessing the rising usage of a similar stacked architecture, called the India Stack, in the financial services sector. Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar and mobile phones have created a fundamental layer of customer identification and access, on which multiple digital transactions can be built. This has the potential to solve our financial inclusion problem by eliminating the classical roadblocks of paper-based identity proofs, interaction with a physical bank and the availability of hard cash. The entire stack is an open resource, which means anyone can access and leverage it. A similar open stack architecture is being used by the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) to provide a platform for tax data management and reporting. The platform will provide the plumbing to bring together all GSTN stakeholders including taxpayers, banks, and central and state governments to completely transform Indias tax landscape.This is paradigm shift in technology architecture where innovation happens at the bottom of the stack and is available as a public good at a very low cost to everybody. The implications of this shift are quite profound and if deployed well can be used to address some of our very core socio-economic challenges.Ability to address Indias chronic challenges: Healthcare is one of the most complex challenges of our time, with the infrastructure and capital required to fix the problems and reduce the inequity in healthcare access being insufficient so far. Despite making progress over the last decade, India accounts for a disproportionate percentage of global incidences of disease. We have seven doctors for every 10,000 people, which is only half the average global doctor-patient ratio. Large-scale change is never easy, but technology holds extraordinary promise in helping address our healthcare challenges.By leveraging the technology stack already in placewide connectivity through mobile phones and high-speed data networks, Aadhaar, digitization of health recordswe can significantly improve every element of our health system, from education for prevention, to treatment and management. Big Data and analytics can fundamentally alter healthcare delivery and transform our public health and medical research initiatives through the establishment of national registries. India can become data-rich very rapidly. And a nationwide, connected, many-to-many health information highway with common data standards and interoperability features can just be what the doctor ordered! A similar approach can also be deployed in critical areas such as education and skilling, and it can fundamentally transform how India teaches and learns.Enabling organizations to be trailblazers: Historically, Indian firms have found it hard to address the challenges of low average purchasing power, lack of minimum efficient scale and widespread socio-economic inequity. With the acceleration of technology, these challenges get decimated. Acceleration in technology, coupled with relatively lower legacy investments, gives Indian firms the opportunity to leapfrog their peers to become global trailblazers. Technology makes investments modular, reducing capital outlays and experimentation costs, while increasing speed and agility, which are critical advantages in todays dynamic macroeconomic environment. There is every reason to believe that the next Alibaba, Amazon, Google, Tesla or Uber can emerge out of India.GOING FORWARD, WE NEED TO ADDRESS THREE KEY AREAS TO UNLOCK THIS TECHNOLOGY REVOLUTION1. How do we ensure sufficient investment in infrastructure at the lower level of the stack?Private returns on infrastructure investments are often substantially lower than the underlying social benefits generated. While benefits accrue to the economy at large through positive externalities, this does not assure returns for the infrastructure investor. Also, when infrastructure investment requires an entirely new generation of expensive technology, such as fibre, 4G or 5G, it can compound market failure. The government, through policy formulation, has a key role to play in encouraging sufficient investment in infrastructure.2. What changes should be make in our education system to equip our youth for the technology revolution?There is a need to rethink technology and vocational skills being imparted at higher education institutions. Future jobs will be very different from those in the market today. In addition to solving the existing challenges our education system faces, we need to ensure that it equips our youth with the necessary multidisciplinary skills to meet the needs of tomorrow. 3. How do we drive collaboration across stakeholders to unlock the full potential of technology-enabled transformation?The government, large corporates, start-ups and NGOs have different strengths and capabilities. There is a need to draw upon the expertise of all these stakeholders, and marrying together their complementary skills. We need the right policies and construct for public-social-private partnerships to make this happen.In summary, technological change is accelerating at an unprecedented pace and will change the world as we know it. If we get our act right as a nation over the next decade, technology can help us take India back 1,000 yearswhen we were the most advanced and thriving economy in the world.Neeraj Aggarwal is managing director, and Rohit Ramesh is partner and director at BCG India.",2016-10-19,UoAUwuuIFV498ndi95U3PI,"If we get our act right, technology can help us take India back 1,000 yearswhen we were the most advanced and thriving economy in the world",competitor,04:59,Accelarating technology: Indias opportunity to leapfrog

Growth in constant currency terms stood at 8.7% for tier-I IT companies in the December quarter, excluding Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., according to data collated by Nomura Research. Two quarters ago, growth stood at over 10%, and a year before that, growth was in the teens.
				   
				Of course, that growth rates have been declining in the IT sector is well known and, as a result, IT stocks have underperformed the Nifty 50 index by around 18% in the past year.The moot question is if the December quarter results give signs of a possible turnaround. Investors will be disappointed there. Nomuras analysts point out that growth in the key US region was the slowest in 12 quarters. Growth in some of the industry verticals that were doing well in previous quarters, such as retail, healthcare and telecom, slowed in the December quarter. And the performance of the largest industry verticalbanking, financial services and insurance (BFSI)gave no hints of a turnaround. Besides, as US firms await the broad policy direction of the new government, there may be some delays in taking decisions.Of course, there are some silver linings. Companies, for instance, are sounding more optimistic, especially with regards to demand from BFSI. Besides, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities say the intensity with which some large corporations shifted work to captive units earlier has abated to an extent.But, from the looks of it, things are likely to go further south before any turnaround comes about. The recent appreciation in the rupee is likely to worsen matters for Indian IT companies. Profit margins have already been under pressure, owing to the increased investments in building digital capabilities and thanks to pricing pressure in the traditional application maintenance work. Besides, all of the noise against H1B visas in the US may result in new laws that increase costs of providing on-site services.

-0.43,"Charlottesville,US: To transform Indias economy, there is a need to reduce friction in businesses and create an environment wherein the government has more trust in its entrepreneurs, Infosys founder N. R. Narayana Murthy has said. 
				   
				For the transformation of the Indian economy, he said it is essential for the younger generation to be daring and that India is integrated with the global economy. We still have a little bit of work in reducing friction to businesses. We need to create an environment where the government has more trust in its entrepreneurs than it is today, Murthy, 70, told students of the prestigious Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia here. Murthy, the recipient of the 2017 Thomas Jefferson Foundation medal in Global Innovation, was responding to Darden School of Business Dean Scott Beardsley who asked, what do you think needs to happen next to transform Indias economy. What is next. Also read: Has Infosyss recovery dissipated before it even started?We want our youngsters to be a little bit more daring in taking the entrepreneurial route more and more than the extent to which they do today. We have to become much more integrated to the world economy so that we can consider the entire world as our market and can become globally competitive. And most importantly we can become much more open minded to learn from the wonderful things that are happening in this country and elsewhere. I would say these are required (for transforming Indias economy to the next level), Murthy said. He, however, refrained from elaborating what the Indian government needs to do to create the environment of trust in its entrepreneurs and said, I will tell you why, as an Indian citizen, it may not be proper if I were to be critical about India when I am outside India. Interacting with students, he said, challenges for entrepreneurs are now different than the time when he started Infosys. Those days access to capital was almost non-existent and government was a big irritant. Today, challenges are different. But in some sense even more complex, because todays entrepreneurs have to be much more smarter than what we were because there is so much of competition on a global scale. Before you can say this can be done, somebody else may have already done it. Therefore, todays entrepreneurs would have to be much more nimble, global, competitive because market is truly determinant for success today unlike our time when managing government was a big determinant in India, he said. Murthy said good governance is all about maximising shareholders value while ensuring fairness, transparency and accountability to all stake holders. Of all the stakeholders, society is the most important player. Respect from the society is the most important ingredient for longevity of a corporation, he said. To be honoured by the most innovative country in the world and to be awarded a medal in the name of Thomas Jefferson, author of Declaration of Independence is to me a big honour. I will certainly work hard, and hopefully smart in the remaining years of my life, to deserve this kindness, this generosity and this affection on their part, he told PTI. The fact that the university has seen it fit to pick up somebody from India, and bestow this honour shows how open this country is and how generous they are, Murthy said. Therefore this is a clear example of how Indian students wherever they are whether in India or here or anywhere else can be sure that as long as they are good citizens of this world, contribute to make the society a better place through peaceful and harmonious methods, they will be recognised, appreciated, he said. Murthy said that Indian students are making a positive impact in the countries they are studying. I have not come across a single person of Indian-origin who has conducted himself or herself in a manner that has brought sorrow to the society they are living in, anywhere, wherever in the world. So I think that is the right way. I am very very proud of our Indian students. They are smart, have very good values and are very peaceful. They contribute to the society in a very significant way wherever they are. I just want them to continue to do this, the Infosys founder said. The one important principle that Indian students should remember in everything they do is will this make India a more respected place, a more respected nation? Will this action of mine make me a better part of this community? Will this action deserve appreciation and affection from other members in this community? If they remember these then they will do everything possible, Murthy said.

				The company also plans to enter the spot LNG market this year, said two officials aware of the development.HPCL has an equal joint venture agreement with Shapoorji Pallonji Port Pvt.

An HPCL official declined to name the six suppliers citing confidentiality clauses. LNG aggregators and fleet operators such as BP Plc. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc., are among the companies providing access to spot natural gas to interested buyers. Commissioning the terminal will help HPCL source LNG for its own refineries as well as to market natural gas for customers connected through gas pipelines.HPCL, as part of its expansion plan in the LNG segment, is also testing waters to enter the spot market this year. LNG is sold under long-term contracts and spot. Traditionally, the LNG market favoured long-term contracts but since the drop in crude oil and natural gas prices since 2015, spot trades have assumed significance. HPCL may market LNG cargoes of 60,000-70,000 metric tonnes. This, the second of the two persons said, will help the company establish itself in the gas business before it commissions its LNG terminal.According to Bloomberg, spot LNG prices for Singapore as on 3 January stood at $9.062 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) against $8.82 per mBtu.

				Stating that by and large Indian mindset is always to take the soft option, Murthyone of the pioneers of Indias IT outsourcing industrysaid becoming multi- cultural is not easy and is a very, very hard option. They (Indian software companies) must recruit American residents in the US, Canadians in Canada, British people in Britain etc. Thats the only way, we can become a true multi-national company and in order to do that, we should stop using H1-B visas and sending a large number of Indians to those countries to deliver services, Murthy told NDTV.Also read: Indian IT firms to plead case before Trump administration officials He added that recruitment from colleges should be done and local people be trained to add value to Indian companies. The proposed overhaul of popular H-1B visa regime by US President Donald Trump has raised concerns among the Indian IT firms. Also, the recent introduction of a US bill (Lofgren Bill) that proposes doubling of the minimum wages of H-1B visa holders to $130,000 from $60,000 has made the industry worried. Any changes in the visa regime may result in higher operational costs and shortage of skilled workers for the $110 billion Indian outsourcing industry. I think even if the executive order comes, we should look at it more as opportunity for Indian companies to become more multi-cultural than we have been, rather than looking at it as a lacuna, Murthy said. The US contributes nearly 62% of the exports.

Why did you agree to take on this role as co-chairman?Because the board asked me to. But also because I love Infosys. Just like the Idea of India (Sunil Khilnanis book), the idea of Infosys is a powerful one; Infosys remains a vital institution of our country. Its important that it continues to flourish.Was this decision solely the boards or was it made after some of the founders suggested it?This was a decision of the board. Why did the board decide to go for a co-chairman? Simple because when an aircraft is going through turbulent weather, it only helps to get a co-pilot. Questions have been raised by some of the founders against the board and even against the management. So how would you get both the founders and board aligned and make sure this is not a distraction for the management? For the record, I was close to the founders of Infosys before I joined the board. What they accomplished was incredible. I hope to remain close to them long after I cease to be on the board. Equally, I believe in the strategy that (CEO) Vishal Sikka has set out for transforming Infosys. I intend to do my very best to see that he succeeds in this mission. Everything else is a sideshow. I dont see any contradiction here.How do you rate Vishals leadership in the three years that he has been CEO now?I think Infosys has done somethings incredibly well under Vishals leadership. We have a bold and differentiated strategy which customers are excited about; customer satisfaction is at an all-time high. Most employees are energized by the vision and strategy. Vishal and his team have built on the momentum they inherited and closed the gap with competition. Many seeds for the future have been sown and we see the green shoots in many areasin AI, in automation, with initiatives like design thinking. That said, the transformation is a work in progress. Some things arent working as intended and course corrections are being applied. There are pockets of underperformance which represent opportunities. We need to rapidly scale up things that are working. There are capability gaps that need to be fixed. But overall, I am optimistic about our prospects.How will the co-chair arrangement work? How will you delineate roles to make sure theres no overlap?Sesh (R. Seshasayee) and I have known each other for 20 years and worked on the Infy board for six years, so we are quite comfortable with each other. We have decided that there are some areas that he will continue to lead such as overall leadership of the board or investor outreach while in other areas like strategy or talent I will work more closely with Vishal and his team. We have decided that we will work as partners rather than compartments.What are your immediate priorities?My first priority is to help align all stakeholders around the transformation journey that we are on. The second is to work closely with Vishal in helping build a world class leadership team that can execute the transformation strategy.Your elevation has been seen positively and the general view is that relations between the board and the founders will improve now. Whats your take on that and how do you intend to repair relations with the founders?I have the greatest respect for the founders of Infosys and especially for Mr (N.R. Narayana) Murthy who has been a mentor and friend for a long time. I believe that everyone wants the same thingwhich is to see Infosys flourish and prosper from the incredible opportunities that are being thrown up by technology shifts. The board and leadership team wants this. Investors want this. Employees want this. The founders want this. However, this is a journey through uncharted waters and so the key is to earn the trust of all stakeholders so we stay together through the ups and downs of this voyage. Trust really is the key. This requires intense, honest and ongoing dialogue. It also requires courage, willingness to experiment, assimilate feedback, learn and change.After a stellar year in 2015-16, the last 12 months have been slow by Infys lofty standards. What in your opinion needs to be fixed immediately in order to get back the company to industry-leading growth?This has been a tough year for everyone with growth slowing and severe commoditization. Infys performance must be seen not just in absolute terms but in the context of the industry. Vishal has already commented on our performance and what he and the team will do. I personally believe we have to more aggressively move investments and our brightest people from more commoditized areas towards our best growth prospects which are in areas such as digital, cyber security, AI, IOT and so on. Our job as a board is to support management in moving much more quickly on the many opportunities we have.Will you reduce your other board commitments now that youre taking up this role? Will you remain chairman at BoB?The transformation of BoB is also a work in progress. (P.S.) Jayakumar and his team have worked really hard and we are seeing the green shoots of their labour.

				In early 2009, NTT Docomo invested Rs14,500 crore ($2.2 billion) in an Indian wireless business on the understanding that if certain targets werent met in five years, its partner, Mumbai-based Tata Group, would either find a buyer for the Japanese companys 26.5% stake at fair market value, or would take over those shares at half the original value of the investment, whichever was higher. When Docomo decided to exercise the option in April 2014, there was no taker for the unprofitable operations, so the Tatas sought central bank permission to pay out the equivalent of Rs7,250 crore.By then, however, the Reserve Bank of India had a new set of rules that banned any exit by a foreign equity investor at an assured price. Still, the central bank, under Governor Raghuram Rajan, wanted to allow the payment because it was a question of an Indian company honouring an agreement, struck at a time when there was no clear law against options embedded in such an investment. Also, this clearly wasnt a case of foreign-currency debt masquerading as equity. How many creditors agree in advance to a 50% haircut after five years? Yet the Indian government, which had the final say, decided the Tatas shouldnt be allowed to pay Docomo.In January 2015, Docomo took the dispute to the London Court for International Arbitration. Last month, the court awarded the Japanese firm $1.17 billion (Rs7,840 crore at the current rate) in compensation from Tata Sons, the Indian conglomerates holding company.The saga should have ended there, except that:Bloomberg News reports that New Delhi intends to block the arbitration payment, too; Japans Nikkei says Docomo might ask a US court to seize Tata assets; The Financial Times has learned from a person close to Docomo that the Japanese company might seek enforcement action on Tata Groups British businesses; and The Tata Group is countering that the struggling Port Talbot steel plant in south Wales, as well as UK-based Jaguar Land Rover, are owned by Tata Steel and Tata Motors  theyre not Tata Sons properties. So the whole thing has become a spectacle. The Indian governments refusal to take a commonsense view of Docomos claim was a poor decision. New Delhi is now making bad judgment worse by threatening to block the arbitration award.Such actions have consequences. Not only has the governments pigheadedness created unnecessary risks for minority shareholders of publicly traded Tata Steel and Tata Motors, it has also cast doubts on Prime Minister Narendra Modis resolve to change investors experience of doing business in India.

Wipros large rivals, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd, run the risk of slower growth this year than the 7.1% and 9.1% growth recorded last year. To be sure, some of the early signs of the measures taken have started reflecting well, with the company improving its ability to generate more business from existing clients, and arresting declining profitability.Wipro has managed to improve average revenue per client to about $6.6 million at the end of September from $6 million at the start of the financial year in April.The firm managed to hold on to a 17.8% operating margin, same as during the April-June period, despite giving salary raises to close to 174,000 employees during the July-September period.

The board was given four months to complete the task. In the interim, the board has requested me to perform the role of chairman and I have agreed to do so in the interest of and reassurance to the Tata group, Ratan Tata, 78, said in a statement addressed to colleagues.ALSO READ | Uneasy lies the Tata crownThe development, which portends at least short-term turmoil, comes at a time when the conglomerate, whose business interests range from tea to telecom and salt to software services, has been trying to recast or dispose of the key UK steel business, which it acquired in a $12.9 billion purchase of Corus Group Plc. in 2007 under Ratan Tata.This is quite an unusual situation, unexpected from a group like Tata which stands for its values. This means there could possibly have been some governance issue or some major disagreement with either the style of functioning or decision that Mistry may have taken, said Kavil Ramachandran, professor and executive director at the Thomas Schmidheiny Centre for Family Enterprise at the Indian School of Business.According to a person aware of the development, the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, of which Mistry is a scion and which is estimated to hold an 18% stake in Tata Sons, is protesting the move, paving the ground for what could be a messy battle. About two-thirds of Tata Sons is held by philanthropic trusts such as the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Mistry will continue as a Tata Sons director, the spokesperson cited earlier said. However, the group executive council (GEC), a brainchild of Mistrys, has been disbanded, said a person aware of the development. The GEC page has been pulled down from Tata Sons website as has Mistrys September interview to the in-house magazine in which he stated his views on some of the underperforming companies in the group. Our individual companies need to earn the right to grow, he said in the interview.The boardroom putsch has been some time in the making, according to a person close to Mistry, who asked not to be identified. Differences have surfaced over how Mistry has been dealing with the significant challenges facing the group.Several of Mistrys operational decisions were challenged by Ratan Tata, according to this person. Still, it is the prerogative of the largest shareholder to do this, the person said a few weeks ago. Mint couldnt ascertain if there was an immediate trigger for this ouster.Primarily, it was a lack of communication between the shareholder and the management. A lot of decision-making was done unilaterally by Tata Sons and was not approved by Tata Trusts, said another person briefed about the matter.Among the six chairmen Tata Sons has had so far in its history, Mistrys is the shortest tenure at just short of four years.ALSO READ | Ratan Tata says intolerance a curse we are seeing of lateSince taking over, Mistry has repeatedly talked about continuing to seize business opportunities, especially in emerging technologies.

0.49,"Infosys Ltd has lagged peers on revenue and profit growth in six of the past seven years. But even when its competitive position rapidly deteriorated, it held on to the pole position for one important metriccash flow generation.
				   
				In the past seven years, cash flow from operations amounted to 23.3% of revenues for Infosys, compared to 19.8% in the case of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and 16.2% for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. But, as is well known, Infosys has lagged considerably in terms of shareholder returns during this period. Cash may be king, but it is clearly no emperor. Investors far prefer strong growth accompanied by a reasonable amount of cash generation to exceptional cash generation accompanied by sluggish growth.Is TCS now falling into the same trap? Its growth rate has fallen considerably and cash flow generation has improved in recent years. It has closed the gap with Infosys considerably in terms of cash generated from operations19.3% of revenues in FY16 versus 19.6% for Infosys. Besides, it has curtailed capital expenditure. As a result, it has overtaken Infosys in free cash flow generation in the past two years. The amount spent by TCS on capital expenditure and acquisitions accounted for just 12.5% of cash flow from operations in the past two years, compared to 28.7% in the case of Infosys.Should investors be worried? According to an analyst with a multinational brokerage firm, the company has chosen the organic route to invest for the future, compared to some of its peers who have preferred acquisitions to plug gaps in their portfolio. Analysts at JPMorgan India Pvt. Ltd said in note to clients after attending an 18 March analysts meet, We came away with an enhanced appreciation of TCSs digital capabilities and conclude that its lack of M&A in digital does not necessarily mean lack of capabilityit is strongly building the needed, differentiating digital strengths organically.Another reason cash flow generation has improved in recent years is that the company has reduced its exposure to some emerging markets such as India. Working capital needs are typically higher in these regions, and the lower exposure has meant that overall cash generation has improved. Both of the above points suggest that growth isnt necessarily being sacrificed. Of course, it remains to be seen if TCSs plan to grow organically helps it catch up with peers soon.Thankfully for Infosyss shareholders, its new leadership has made growth a priority. The company even beat TCS on revenue growth in fiscal year 2015-16. M&A (mergers and acquisitions) activity has picked up, indicating that it is getting bolder with its use of cash. And cash flow from operations fell to below 20% of revenues last year, compared to around 24% in the preceding three years.

				The 78-year-old Tata is now part of the selection panel that has been asked to search the next chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, the groups main holding company, within next four months and he would also serve as interim chairman in this period.Also Read: Cyrus Mistry ousted as Tata Sons chairman, Ratan Tata steps inA low-profile man to the extent of being reclusive, Mistry, 48, was a surprise choice to succeed Tata, who retired on 29 December, 2012 as chairman of the one of the countrys oldest business empires. The only second non-Tata to take charge of the group after Nowroji Saklatvala in 1932, Mistry by virtue of his age came in with a lot of promise, specially of continuity when he became chairman of Tata Sonsthe promoter of the major operating Tata companies at the age of 44. However, in nearly four years since he took over the reins of the salt-to-software conglomerate, Mistry had to face many challenges in both domestic and global markets as many of the group companies faced headwinds. He undertook a strategy of divesting assets in contrast to what his successor did. Significant among them is the groups steel business, specially Tata Steel Europe. Earlier this year, the company had completed selling of the European long products business in the UK as well as a mill in France to Greybull Capital. It had also announced plans to sell its UK operations after years of losses, although the company is yet to finalize the sale. In July, Tata groups hospitality firm Indian Hotels Company Ltd (IHCL), which runs Taj Group of hotels, completed sale of Taj Boston hotel for $125 million (about Rs839 crore). The hospitality firm had also sold off 12.7 lakh shares of Belmond (earlier known as Orient Express, which the Tata Group tried unsuccessfully to acquire in Ratan Tatas time) for a consideration of $11.96 million. IHCL had also sold BLUE Sydney, a Taj Hotel, to Australia Hotels & Properties Ltd for AU$ 32 million (nearly Rs179 crore) in 2014. The Tata group is also engaged in a legal battle with Japans Docomo over the split of their telecom joint venture Tata Docomo. Contrary to these developments, Tata led the group into some notable acquisitions, starting from Tetley by Tata Tea for $450 million in 2000 to steelmaker Corus by Tata Steel in 2007 and the landmark Jaguar Land Rover in 2008 for $2.3 billion by Tata Motors.

-0.03,"Have start-ups in India become too sexy? Yes, in the opinion of Kishore Biyani, the 56-year-old founder and group chief executive of retail giant Future Group. Biyani, speaking on Wednesday at The Economist India Summit in New Delhi, also said he thinks, according to multiple media reports, that 90% of the countrys start-ups are not going anywhere. They are hopeless, he says, according to a PTI report.
				   
				To be fair, up until a few months ago, it did feel a lot like a wild party was underway in Indias start-up market. A lot of that had to do with the copious amounts of capital sloshing around. Everybody was in the mood to talk up start-upsinvestors, entrepreneurs, the media, even the government. The exuberance on all fronts, except maybe for the government, has lately died down with the advent of a correction in the funding market.But heres the thing. Correction or not, theres very little thats sexy about starting up in India. Especially for first-generation entrepreneurs, against whom much of Biyanis ire is directed. Funds are scarce. There are just about 20 active venture capital firms in the country and less than five venture debt firms. Compliance is still a nightmare and then there are horrors like a tax on capital raised from angel investors. There are middlemen to deal with at every step in any business. And socially, it still remains far from acceptable compared with most other career choices. Even within hip start-up hubs such as Bengaluru, Mumbai, Gurgaon and New Delhi.Yet, every year, more and more people from predominantly middle-class backgrounds take the plunge and start up. Some quit jobs that pay reasonably well. Others start straight out of college. By software industry lobby Nasscoms estimates, there are currently over 5,000 technology start-ups in the country, funded or not by venture capital. More than 90% of such ventures are indeed doomed for failure. Often within a year of starting up. The high failure rate isnt specific to India. Its the standard anywhere in the world where entrepreneurs, usually first generation, have tried to disrupt traditional markets.Whats important to remember, though, is that it takes only the surviving 10% to make all the difference. Lets set aside the e-commerce sector, everybodys favourite whipping boy these days, for the moment. Instead, take the example of the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry. Indias BPO start-ups were born in the shadow of the dotcom bust. Out of the hundreds of BPO companies that started up at the time, 90% failed or wound down operations due to lack of funds. But the less than 10% that survived, among them Daksh eServices (acquired by International Business Machines Corp.), Spectramind (bought by Wipro Ltd) and Customer Asset (acquired by Firstsource), became the foundation for a $25 billion industry, turned India into the worlds back-office, and now employs millions of people.Coming to e-commerce, the poster child of the current start-up wave in the country, theres no doubt that theres been some excess in terms of the capital that has been gobbled up by start-ups in the space. Most of that money has in the past chased valuations rather than profits and many in the start-up ecosystem fear that the irrational exuberance that existed could still prove costly in the long term. It doesnt help that a certain e-commerce company in Bengaluru, that seems to be losing value, on paper, ever too frequently these days, is perceived as being on the verge of collapse.Yet, despite those drawbacks, the verdict is still out on e-commerce start-ups and the overall well-being of the start-up ecosystem. The correction in the market has ensured that tourist entrepreneurs, as one venture capitalist in Mumbai put it half in jest, are being weeded out. As long as the 10% who survive continue to push through, it will be more than enough to prove that start-ups have and will always matter. As for Biyani, Alok Goyal, co-founder of recently minted venture capital firm Stellaris Venture Partners, summed it up best in a tweet on microblogging platform Twitter, He (Biyani) should be worried about the remaining 10%!Snigdha Sengupta is a consulting writer with Mint.

According to an analyst with a multinational brokerage firm, while Gopinathan is sharp and intelligent, his elevation as CEO is likely to irk more senior colleagues who headed business for large geographies and verticals.What makes things look disconcerting is the current backdrop of demand for IT outsourcing. The shift in customers spending patterns from traditional services to digital services has hurt companies such as TCS.Besides, the election of Donald Trump is likely to increase visa and other costs for outsourcing companies.

-0.13,"Last week, an Indian company acquired an Indiana firm. Wipro announced that it was acquiring Appirio, a software integration and technology consulting firm based in Indianapolis. Appirio was established a decade ago to provide technology integration services to clients looking to adopt public cloud applications and platforms, and to focus on what many have called the as-a-service mode of delivering software and business processes. All that as-a-service means is that you have the ability to rent and pay for software features as and when you use them, rather than buy the software itself.
				   
				Much is made today over the as-a-service way of acquiring software. According to analyst firms that track spending in the information technology services sector, the sector is seeing a hefty rebound in demand, most of it driven by corporate spending on the adoption of as-a-service technologies. The methods that these analyst firms use are myriad, like feverishly trawling the Internet for public announcements of services deals, and relying on information technology service providers to give them data on deals they have just concluded. In my experience, these data are collated and then extrapolated to the market by a single individual at the firmand are error pronebut nonetheless, can point to macro shifts in buying patterns.As a result, Wipro has been hailed as a visionary for acquiring a company that has firmly established itself as a leading provider of as-a-service delivery. It now has the ability to make serious moves in the market and has added an arrow to its quiver which is different than all its other arrows, which mainly represent offshore services for a cheaper price. Last week, Mint carried an analysis of Wipros acquisition strategy in comparison to its peers and noted how its acquisitions have allowed it to leapfrog some of its peers in terms of revenue accretion.Coming back to the as-a-service economy, this sort of rent versus buy decision moves in waves over time. Not so long ago, before Indias mobile phone revolution, the country was dotted with ISD/STD call booths in every corner in a classic example of as-a-service delivery. You didnt need to own a landline phone when you could simply walk up to a phone booth and in return for a fee, use someone elses phone for the short duration that you needed to actually make a call. Once it became cheap enough to acquire and use a mobile phone to make calls on ones own, these booths all but disappeared from the Indian landscape.So will it be with the as-a-service wave. What analysts forget is that it is largely traditional, old-fashioned and stable technology that is now being delivered as-a-service. Well-established enterprise resource software (software that helps support sales, production operations, logistics, distribution and financial accounting) such as SAP, Oracle and Salesforce are all now increasingly being delivered as-a-service rather than being bought for hefty licensing fees and the systems integration costs that go with such purchases.The as-a-service economy will not work for new types of software that fundamentally alter the workings of a firm. It simply does not make sense to buy software as-a-service in instances where software or technology is used as a strategic or competitive advantage. Firms building or buying such software in the quest for digital disruption will be looking to keep their competition out, not just use an as-a-service model to rent what can just as easily be rented by their competition. These new types of software will carry new-world data analytics and algorithms that drastically change the way a traditional business operatesand as such are likely to be closely guarded corporate secrets.Interestingly, these algorithms are only being partially built by companies themselves. In this age of open-source programming, and the ready availability of free programming libraries with a simple click of the cursor, corporations are increasingly turning to the programming community at large in a phenomenon called crowdsourcing to solve knotty problems with respect to data analytics and the composition of software algorithms in order to shore up their own considerable internal efforts at building these. Publicly available platforms are being increasingly used for the requisitioning and delivery of services. Service requests are being filled on Twitter and listening posts are being used on LinkedIn to generate sales leads. Companies are using these platforms to hand out prizes to star programmers from the programming community at large who solve the knottiest of their problems in software coding or algorithmic logic. These problems can be parsed out to a point where it is just the tough mathematical or logical issue that is passed on to the platform to solve; the entire program or the function it is designed to perform need never be divulged.And it is precisely for this reason that Wipros acquisition of Appirio is appropriate. Appirio owns both TopCoder and its competitor, CloudSpokes, together forming the largest platform for crowdsourcing of such problems. Some estimates place this number at about 800,000 programmers all over the globe; others claim that this number is actually in the millions. Whatever the actual number, this platform allows for the brightest computing minds to compete at solving the computing problems of the future. Little wonder then, that at a social event last weekend, Rishad Premji, chief strategy officer of Wipro, exclaimed TopCoder when I congratulated him on his new buy and asked him what he thought was the most salient reason why I felt this acquisition represented a watershed event.Siddharth Pai is a world-renowned technology consultant who has personally led over $20 billion in complex, first-of-a-kind outsourcing transactions.",2016-11-01,Yj7Z9wLVL7JM2zCj0U6LCO,"In this age of open-source programming, firms are increasingly turning to the programming community at large to solve knotty problems",both,00:32,The real reason why Wipros deal to buy Appirio is appropriate

The winners were selected after a rigorous judging process. The innovators were felicitated on 9 and 10 March at EmTech 2017, the second edition of the emerging technology conference organized in Delhi by Mint and MIT Technology Review.
Akash DongreOrganization: Indus OSDesignation: Co-founder and chief product officerInnovation: A multilingual operating system available on over 50 mobile devicesEducation: BTech in mechanical engineering from IIT BombayAkash Dongrealong with co-founders Rakesh Deshmukh and Sudhir Bangarambandihas always believed that Indian problems require indigenous solutions. No wonder their eponymous innovation, touted as the worlds first regional operating system, is blazing a trail in the Indian smartphone ecosystem. In our short journey, beginning in 2015, we have already partnered with five domestic smartphone brands (Micromax, Intex, Karbonn, Celkon and Swipe) and built a user base of more than six million, which is consistently growing at a rate of 500,000 OS activations per month, says Dongre. Indus OS, which is available in 12 Indian regional languages, boasts innovative features such as Indus Swipe (translation from English to a regional language and vice versa with just a swipe), Indus Keyboard (with built-in word and matra (a unit of metrical quantity in Indian languages) prediction) and Indus Reader (which can convert an English text into audio in eight regional languages). Besides, theres a marketplace called App Bazaar, where over 50,000 apps are available in local languages.Dongre recalls one of his foreign trips when his lack of understanding of the local language made him feel handicapped: Everything around me was in a language I did not understand. Dongre also realized how digitally less connected the Indian heartland is and how alien English is to a lot of Indians. After spending some more time to understand the Indian digital landscape and brainstorming with my team, we decided to start building an ecosystem for Indian consumers. The team built Indus OS on three core pillars: simplicity, innovation and localization. At the heart of our story lies the desire to equip anyone who is using a smartphone with a holistic ecosystem of their choice, says Dongre.Indus OS, which introduced Indus OS 2.0 in July 2016, will introduce Indus OS 3.0 in 2017. In 2017, we intend to continue to work with the Government of India and app developers alike to build a smartphone ecosystem of choice for the emerging markets population, Dongre says.Ankit JhanwarOrganization: Pluss Advanced TechnologiesDesignation: Vice-president, corporate planning and strategyInnovation: A packaging box for vaccine transportation that uses phase change materials and a unique design for precise temperature controlEducation: BTech in polymer science and technology from IIT Roorkee; certificate in entrepreneurship, management and global leadership from London School of Economics and Political ScienceAn optimist by nature, Ankit Jhanwar was not put off by the disinterest displayed by some packaging companies in developing a temperature-controlled shipping solution using phase change materials (PCMs)a domain in which his company, Pluss Advanced Technologies, had been working since 2005. Such a temperature-controlled solution could prove very useful in cutting down the 30% wastage of vaccines in the existing cold chain system in the country. So what Pluss did was develop a complete shipping solution using its own proprietary PCMs, which could not only provide better temperature control but also address the challenging Indian ambient conditions of 40°C. A range of products were planned to address the gaps at each leg of the supply chain right from manufacturer to the depot to the distributor to chemist and finally to the patient, says Jhanwar.The shipping solution that he developed was branded Celsurewhich uses the PCM technology to provide precise temperature control. It is the only shipping solution which provides temperature control for more than 72 hours even at ambient temperature of 40°C, he says. Thanks to this innovation, all the current pharmaceutical shipments which happen by air can now be done by road using Celsuresomething that can lead to huge savings in freight cost, thereby making it possible to lower the prices of medicines.According to Jhanwar, Celsure also addresses the unique challenge of shipping from a hot environment (say, India) to a cold environment (like Europe) or vice versa. Whats more, the solution has brought in simplicity in the packaging, removing human errors. Jhanwar says that its available in sizes as small as one vial to as large as 10,000 vials and can provide temperature control for as low as 2 hours to as high as 120 hours. Pluss has a goal of reducing medicine wastage due to ineffective cold chain to as low as 0.1% in the next three-five years. The firm is constantly working on scaling up and commercializing the innovation. Celsure was launched in April 2016 with only one variant; eight more variants have been added within a year. Logistics firms such as Blue Dart and DHL have adopted Celsure as one of their preferred modes of shipping temperature-sensitive pharma products. Successful trials have also been run with various pharmaceutical firms. Besides commercializing it in India, Pluss plans to go global with the launch in Singapore and the Middle East in 2018 and in the US and Europe in 2019. We are also keen on tie-ups with the government, World Health Organization (WHO), Unicef and other related organizations for last-mile delivery of vaccines. Customized products are being planned to address the last mile challenges, says Jhanwar. Anusha RammohanOrganization: General Electric Global ResearchDesignation: Lead engineerInnovation: Flow analytics for multi-phase flow metering in oil and gas industryEducation: BE (Hons.) in electronics and instrumentation from BITS-Pilani; MS in electrical engineering from Arizona State University, USAnusha Rammohan believes that the intersection of the digital and physical worlds is the ideal space for disruptive innovations. And thats exactly what attracted her to the esoteric domain of flow analytics for multi-phase flow metering in the oil and gas industry.As the lead engineer at GE Global Researchs John F Welch Technology Center in Bengaluru, Anusha got the opportunity to combine physical sensors with advanced analytics to develop a solution capable of radically transforming the processes of the entire industry. As the global energy demand continues to increase, there is an urgent need in the oil and gas industry to be more efficient with resources, people and investments to reduce the cost of producing oil while doing so safely with reduced environmental impact, says Rammohan. Her innovation addresses this need by combining sensor and device data in the field using intelligent analytics to provide accurate and reliable information in real time about oil production. For instance, she says, timely information about well and field level production of oil, water and gas allows operators to make critical decisions related to optimizing pumps, allocating resources and energy to each well, shutting down or stimulating wells, and preventing leakage and blockage of pipes, etc. By transforming data into actionable insights, her analytics solution enables increased oil recovery, reduced human intervention and improved resource planning.Not merely restricting her innovation to a single industry, the next stop for Anusha is to extend it to applications in industries such as aviation, power and transportation. The applications include performance optimization of assets, health monitoring of safety-critical components and their increased reliability and reduced downtimeall of which can significantly improve productivity and bring down costs. Rammohan has been granted patents related to her work in image mapping, sensor positioning and flow measurement; she has filed for more. She dreams of a world powered by analytics and technologies such as artificial intelligenceone in which autonomous decision making would greatly reduce the ambiguity, uncertainty and human subjectivity that are currently proving to be bottlenecks in all industries.Kshitij MarwahOrganization: Tesseract ImagingDesignation: FounderInnovation: Virtual reality (VR) camera to create and share high resolution VR/holographic content; holographic augmented reality headsetEducation: MTech in computer science from IIT Delhi; MS in media arts and sciences from MIT Media Lab, Massachusetts, USKshitij Marwah says virtual reality and augmented reality (VR and AR) are the new mediums for human beings to tell their stories in a much more experiential and immersive manner. It marks a natural progression, as he says:  From the spoken word to the written word, from photos to videoswe have always found new ways and tools to tell our stories.The power of his belief in VR and AR, backed by the rigour of his technical education (never mind that he dropped out of his PhD at MIT Media Lab), led Marwah to his innovations: Quark VR camera and the Holoboard AR viewing headset. Says he, The Quark VR camera will democratize mixed reality content creation and the Holoboard AR headset will allow for its viewing in a truly immersive and unique manner.Marwah has a simple way of explaining his innovation. Imagine the next time when you are watching a cricket match in your house. Rather than sitting in front of your television, with our Quark camera streaming the match live in VR and the Holoboard headset, you can feel as if you are sitting right in the stadium but in the comfort of your couch, he says.His current company, Tesseract Imaging (in Norse mythology, Tesseract is said to be a cosmic cube of immense power; in geometry, the tesseract is a four-dimensional hypercube), was spun out of MIT Media Labs India arm, a unit that Marwah had co-founded to promote and spread inter-disciplinary learning among students in India. He is credited with growing the Lab initiative from a platform of 50 students to 500 students selected from hundreds of thousands of applicants across the country. He headed the India arm of the Lab from 2012 to 2015.Marwah believes that the innovations coming out of Tesseract will revolutionize the way we capture, consume and see content and media. On the anvil are plans to begin shipping the Quark VR cameras in mid-2017 and Holoboard AR headsets by the end of the year. With our technology, we believe we can make sure that our society can capture, share and consume their daily experiences and share stories across generations with an experience that is immersive and powerful.Nishant KumarOrganization: Embryyo Technologies Pvt. LtdDesignation: Founder and CEOInnovation: Sensor and mobile app-based drug adherence monitoring system for tuberculosisEducation: Dual degree in mechanical engineering from IIT Bombay Nishant Kumar, the founder and chief exec of Embryyo Technologies, a medical technology and research start-up incubated at Punes Venture Centre, was troubled by the way tuberculosis (TB) treatment was left midway by a large number of patients in India. There wasnt an effective way of ensuring patients stayed the course. This was because the TB medication involves a drug regimen of about 6 months where the patient is required to take a total of about 400 pills, he says. There are several reasons why treatment is left incomplete, including side effects, forgetfulness, poor counselling and duration of the regimen. The enormity of the problemas many as 2.5 million people in India were affected by TB in 2015 as per a World Health Organization reportinspired Kumar to do something about it. He visited the local district level hospitals and direct observation treatment (DOT) centres to interact with the clinicians, healthcare workers and patients, which helped him in collecting more insights and further strengthened his resolve to address this problem. He says that it demanded an easy-to-use, affordable solution which could fit seamlessly in an already established public health infrastructure in the country. The result was BoxRx, an electronic medical event monitoring system that has currently been piloted for drug adherence monitoring in TB patients. According to Kumar, most people with TB are cured by a strictly followed, six-month drug regimen but any interruption to it can cause drug resistance.That is where the innovation behind BoxRx comes in handy. The solution comprises a specially designed electronic pill box which carries the TB blister pack as prescribed by the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP). A tearable paper with conductive ink tracks printed corresponding to each pill is placed beneath the blister pack before closing the box. Whenever a pill is removed from the blister pack, the conductive track gets broken and this activity is logged and transmitted from an in-built Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) circuit to a central server in the form of an SMS. The server processes the information in the SMS and updates the mobile application of the doctor/health worker assigned to that particular patient.To scale up the innovation, Kumar plans to work very closely with the national and international organizations that are leading the TB control programmes. Also on the cards is large-scale manufacturing and on-field implementation of the innovation so that it reaches the maximum number of patients. Kumar envisions a society that is centred on harmonious and sustainable co-existence. I believe that good health is the primary signature of prosperity for an individual, a family, a nation and the world at large, he says.Pankaj AgarwalDesignation: Creative leaderOrganization: Samsung ElectronicsInnovation: A button-type device that connects to toys and a mobile app to enable intuitive interactions for kidsEducation: BTech in electrical engineering from IIT Kanpur; MS from Seoul National University; MBA from Harvard Business SchoolWhenever Pankaj Agarwal saw his son Anant play alone with his toy blocks, a question often nagged him: Why does he have to play alone? Is there something I can do to make play-at-home social and interactive for him? He was also inspired to change the status quo when he looked at the many expensive toys gathering dust around his house. Agarwal thought of the millions of middle-class homes that just couldnt afford all those high-tech toys with pricey tags.So he added a simple and interactive, yet relatively inexpensive, tag of his own: TagPlus. The innovation comprises a button-type smart tag, a smart app (for phones/tablets), and, above all, content created and shared in the cloud by kids as young as 7-year-olds. A key benefit of TagPlus is that it can increase the repeat play value of toys. An important feature of the innovation, says Agarwal, is that there is no set-up required. No device pairing, no logins, no passwords! When kids buy toys that have this smart tag, they can start playing on the TagPlus platform immediately after unwrapping it. Kids can click, long press, shake and bump their smart tags and the smart app will respond accordingly. A click on the smart tag activates the TagPlus app on a nearby digital device to show toy-related content. A long press action will bring on a social media interface where kids can easily upload their creations and also see the creations of other kids playing with the same toy. Think of this as a mini Facebook for kids, says Agarwal. A shake action on the smart tag will help kids find and connect with children playing with an identical toy who could be anywhere in the world. Also, when kids bump two tags from two different toys, the connected app shows multiple ways in which the toys can be combined to create something entirely new. Agarwal and his other TagPlus team members at Samsung believe that this patent-pending technology platform has the potential to make kids playing experiences more serendipitous, socially engaging and creative by seamlessly bridging their virtual and physical play environments. Agarwal and his colleagues did multiple pilot tests of TagPlus in South Korea and they are also in discussion with many toy makers to adopt the platform. The response has been very positive, he says. Agarwal plans to continue his innovative work in the creative domain and believes that members of our society should be educated and imbibe a culture of creativity.Prasant MisraDesignation: ScientistOrganization: TCS Research and Innovation, Tata Consultancy Services LtdInnovation: Auditory sensing for micro unmanned aerial vehicles Education: PhD in computer science and engineering from the University of New South Wales, Sydney; postdoctoral fellowship from the Swedish Institute of Computer Science, StockholmPrasant Misra has been focusing his research efforts around building spatially intelligent systems. His current work pertains to the auditory sensing technology for micro unmanned aerial vehicles (MUAVs, more popularly known as drones). Its like growing the ears for intelligent things, as he puts it. It is part of a grand vision to equip this category of flying robots with a sensory gamut that is on par with humans, he says. This will not only enable such things to derive better spatial intelligence, but also drive cognition to a better level of autonomy by combining auditory sensing with vision.There are, however, fundamental challenges in developing such robust auditory capabilities, especially in capturing the spatial dimensions of a sound scene and analysing its acoustic signature. The signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio is extremely low due to the presence of (near-field) wideband acoustic interference (i.e., self-noise) from the MUAVs spinning rotors and motors, which is both strong and non-stationary, he explains. Theoretically speaking, building an acoustic array with a large number of acoustic elements can overcome such high levels of noise, but the space, payload and energy limitations of an MUAV come in the way of meeting such exhaustive system requirements and computational needs.Misra is now investigating both lightweight acoustic sensing system design, and low-power (but efficient) computation paradigms to overcome this challenge. The initial results, he says, are quite promising.The impact of the work Misra is doing is far-reaching. It will not only force us to rethink the current model of aerial sensing (which is primarily vision dominated), but will also open up newer applications and usage scenarios for the betterment of society. It is now quite common to talk of aerial drones, especially tiny ones with multiple rotors that can hover mid-air, in applications ranging from e-commerce deliveries and inspection of industrial machinery to wildlife monitoring and search-and-rescue operations. Nevertheless, their sensing technology is predominately vision-centric. While the advantages are clearly obvious in visual inspection and monitoring applications, on the flip side, they become unusable in camera-obstructed or low-light conditions, or in scenarios that offer non-visual clues such as those based on sound. In fact, these conditions are a norm in high-stress environments (dense canopy or fog, structures on fire, underground mines, etc.), he says.Misra is working towards taking the MUAV technology from its existing level to cognitive autonomous systems. He believes that as spatial intelligence and cognitive technology mature, the lines between machines and humans would blur, enabling both to live together in the same society as companions. In the future, cognitive aerial drones will take up roles such as aerial cars and taxis, pick up and escort agents, search and rescue bots, and ears and eyes for the disabled. In short: anything you want them to be.Sandeep Senan Designation: Founder and directorOrganization: Evobi Automations Pvt. Ltd (Bibox Labs)Innovation: A toolkit-based approach to learning so that kids can learn through experiments by making things like a robotic toy or a fire alarmEducation: BE in computer science from Visvesvaraya Technological University, Karnataka; MBA in international business from Edith Cowan University, AustraliaWhen it comes to innovation and creativity, Sandeep Senan is as excited as the young kids he wants to empower with the innovative tools at his disposal. His innovation, Bibox (short for Brain-in-a-box), is like an electronic brain which can be instructed by a kid using a graphical software, which can run on a tablet or smartphone or PC or even with cards, he says. Senan is of the view that the realm of innovation must be extended to children rather than remain mostly confined to the adult world. Theres a need for a huge change in the way children are taught and allowed to be creative, he feels.The task of making adults creative is a humongous task, but if we think about kids, they are naturally curious and thus its easy to instill an innovative thinking process in them, says Senan. So when he discovered that there was a lack of tools and curricula designed for instilling the habit of innovation in kids, he decided to do something about it.The innovation Bibox was originated out of that need to give kids the tools to change the world and thus the confidence to keep innovating and make it a habit so that when they become adults, they can go out and make large-scale impact because the thinking is ingrained into their minds, he says.Bibox doesnt have a definite shape or size but is basically a set of toolsprocessors, switches, sensors, battery and software, among othersusing which children in different age groups can try their hand at innovation. This brain, says Senan, can be connected to a variety of accessories, including toys, lights and TV sets, and children can come up with stuff like walking robotic dogs, automatic TV and even connected health products using the Internet of Things.Because Bibox responds to kids logic in the physical world, they can see what the logic means and correct themselves when requiredmaking the learning experience truly experiential, he says. Besides providing them such toolkits, Senans organization also provides them some structured mentoring to enable them to use their creative freedom and confidence to innovate more and more in any field they choose to be in. We are just getting the process started a little early, he says. Through Bibox Labs, he has enrolled more than 25,000 students in over 100 schools in India.To take his innovative ways to a much larger base of students, Senan and his team are digitizing the process of mentoring the kids to be innovators. Once this is in place, he says, any student anywhere in the world would be able to go through the same process that Bibox Labs follows in its affiliate schools. They also plan to partner with private firms, non-governmental organizations and various government bodies to scale up the programme.Subham Banerjee Designation: Young scientistOrganization: Centre for Biodesign and Diagnostic, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, department of biotechnologyInnovation: Transdermal patch against neurotoxin poisoningEducation: Master of pharmacy from West Bengal University of Technology; PhD in pharmacy from Birla Institute of Technology, MesraSoldiers fighting in hostile territories often have to shield themselves against harmful or poisonous gases and chemical substances. One often hears of deadly strikes such as the sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway system (1995), the nerve gas attack in Syria (2013) or the recent attack in Iraq by Islamic State militants in which they set fire to a sulphur mine, spreading sulphur dioxide plumes.Subham Banerjees innovation concerns protecting people against neurotoxic poisoning resulting from such attacks. The exposure of humans to neurotoxins is a major risk factor in severe mortality in chemical or biological warfare situations, as neurotoxins are one of the most potent toxins, he says. His innovation, a transdermal patch that can provide protection against neurotoxin poisoning, comprises an inert adhesive matrix system with active pharmaceutical ingredients. The patch can be applied to intact or even burnt or blistered skin. It works by releasing a combination drug (eserine and pralidoxime chloride) through the skin in what is called a controlled or sustained release mechanism.According to Banerjee, the new patch has an excellent safety profile, can be self-administered, and has positive environmental as well as economic impact. Apart from conventional dosage forms, no novel sustained release prophylactic transdermal patches are currently available in the market, he says. Which is why this innovation has huge socio-economic benefits and the potential to achieve product dominance in the market.In order to sustain this project and take it to the next level of successful commercialization, however, Banerjee says that some studies have to be carried out. For one, process parameters have to be optimized to scale up the capability of manufacturing these patches in bulk quantities. Also, a preclinical toxicity study in rodents needs to be done, followed by a full-fledged pilot for the bioavailability study in human subjects as per the guidelines of the Drug Controller General of India.Banerjee believes that this innovation has the potential to make an extra value-addition to the existing measures for biological warfare protection available with Indias Armed Forces.Vinay Kumar Designation: Co-founder, director and CEOOrganization: PathShodh Healthcare Pvt. LtdInnovation: A single device that can diagnose multiple parameters related to diabetes managementEducation: MTech in microelectronics and VLSI design and MSc in electronic science from Kurukshetra University; PhD from Centre for Nano Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Science BangaloreAt age 14, when Vinay Kumar was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes, his doctor told him he would have to take insulin injections. The look of disappointment on his face prompted the physician to lie that it was only for 10 days that injections were needed. Later on, when Kumar realized that he was stuck with the needle for a lifetime, he became determined to put the hurt and discomfort behind and do something about it. Over the years, diabetes took a bigger and bigger toll on his body, with episodes of hypoglycemia (abnormally low level of sugar in the blood) and even faintingbut all this only strengthened his resolve.In addition to struggling with a debilitating condition like millions in the world do, Kumar constantly thought about how a diabetic can manage his condition better and, at the same time, persisted with his studies. These two aspects of my life merged when I decided to pursue a PhD at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc Bangalore), he says. Besides working on novel ways to diagnose diseases and acquiring multiple patents, he also co-founded (along with Navakanta Bhat and Gautam Sharma) PathShodh Healthcare Pvt. Ltd, a start-up incubated at IISc that is focused on medical device research and development.Kumars innovation is a hand-held point-of-care device which, as a single unit, can measure eight different parameters related to diabetes management and early detection of its complications. With a tiny drop of finger-pricked blood samples, patients can test HbA1c (which gives 90 days blood glucose control profile), glycated albumin (which gives 15 days blood glucose control profile) and instant blood glucose as well, he says. The device can detect very early damage in the kidney by measuring the microalbuminuria, creatinine and ACR (albumin to creatinine ratio) in the urine samples. Apart from these, he adds, it can measure the haemoglobin level for anaemia and chronic kidney disease. The device can measure serum albumin, an important blood marker for kidney and liver. So the single device can take care of full diabetes glycaemic management and early detection of complications such as diabetic nephropathy, explains Kumar.The road ahead for PathShodh is well-defined. The device is ready and regress clinical validation for most of the tests has been completed on real patient samples in collaboration with major pathology labs and hospitals in Bangalore. We also have the manufacturing line setup at IISc to manufacture the disposable test strips for these different tests, says Kumar. The commercial launch of the device can happen any time now. That would certainly move the needle in a positive direction for PathShodhs mission of making healthcare diagnostics affordable and available to all.",2017-03-30,YzDuLxH9TogZlygx9pkEiL,Meet the 10 winners of the Mint-MIT Technology Review competition for innovators below the age of 35 from across India in different cutting-edge domains,company,03:58,EmTech 2017: Innovators under 35
-0.67,"Anil Agarwal has sealed the merger of his mining and energy businesses in India, creating a BHP Billiton Ltd-like resources conglomerate, even as a recent investment in Anglo American Plc. raises questions about how far the billionaires ambitions stretch.
				   
				Vedanta Ltd combined with unit Cairn India Ltd on Tuesday and fixed 27 April as the record date for determining the list of the latters shareholders who will be allotted stock in the parent company, according to a joint statement. Vedanta will offer minority shareholders of oil producer Cairn India one equity share and four redeemable-preference shares with a face value of Rs10 each as part of the deal agreement.The merger gives shareholders a company with a diverse portfolio encompassing iron ore, bauxite, aluminium, power, oil and gas that has the ability to ride out commodity cycles. Agarwal, a self-made billionaire, recently surprised the mining industry by becoming the second-biggest shareholder in Anglo American through an unusual deal that led analysts to speculate he might be planning to force a break up of or a merger with the century-old miner.This merger will increase the appeal of Vedanta Ltd to global investors as it simplifies the structure and increases the size and free float of the company, Tom Albanese, chief executive officer of Vedanta, said in the statement. The firm will continue to focus on remaining a low-cost and low-debt operator, he said.Agarwals fortune has been built on a series of ambitious acquisitions: In 2001, he bought control of then government-owned Bharat Aluminium Co. in one of the first tests of Indias efforts to offload state holdings. He followed with another government entity, Hindustan Zinc Ltd, in a deal that drew the attention of the nations top investigating agency. He successfully bid for what was Indias largest iron ore producer Sesa Goa Ltd. in 2007 and for Cairn India in 2010, despite having no oil and gas experience. Last year, Anglo American was said to have rebuffed informal approaches from the billionaire to discuss ideas including a combination with Hindustan Zinc Ltd.The Vedanta-Cairn combine was proposed by Agarwal in 2015, but delayed after Cairn shareholders held out for a better deal, which was offered last year.It will allow Indias most-indebted metals company after Tata Steel Ltd. to access Cairns cash pile, which stood at Rs26,000 crore ($4 billion) at the end of December. Vedantas debt at the time was Rs65,000 crore, while Cairn is debt-free.They are under pressure because of the heavy debt and the merger is planned only because of this, said Kishor Ostwal, managing director of CNI Research Ltd, an equity research provider in Mumbai. The strong commodity cycle has benefited the group and improving raw material prices will give them a further advantage, he added.Vedanta shares have nearly tripled in the past year, leading gains among Indias 100 largest companies. It advanced in March after unit Hindustan Zinc announced a special dividend of about $2.2 billion, of which the parent will get about $1.4 billion. The dividend payout will cover 68% of Vedantas debt maturities in the fiscal year ending March 2018 and alleviate near-term refinancing risk, according to Moodys Investors Service.The stock looks very interesting and our bias is positive, Ashish Chaturmohta, head of derivatives and technicals at Sanctum Wealth Management Ltd, said by phone. The dividend mostly is going to go for debt reduction and so will the cash with Cairn, he added, saying the stock can move up further.Shares of Vedanta climbed 2.6% to Rs259.25 in Mumbai on Wednesday. The merged company will have a market-capitalization of about $15.6 billion and a higher free float of shares of 49.9%, according to Tuesdays statement.Vedantas 6% 2019 dollar notes rallied 42% in the past year as the company reduced its leverage and strengthened prospects for repayments with dividends.

-0.56,"Investors in Internet start-ups and growth-stage companies have to traverse a strange universe. The closest parallel I can find is the film industry. As a producer (investor), I might have all the right ingredientsa star-studded cast, a fantastic storyline, chart-busting music scores, breathtaking sets and cinematography, and a visionary directorbut whether or not the film does well at the box office is still somewhat of a gamble. You never know whether the reagents are just right to serve up a blockbuster.Except with the Internet start-up, its even worse since there is another twistthe simple fact that there are a bunch of other start-ups with the exact same storyline! This would be akin to several independent production houses producing the same James Bond movie (since they all own the idea or franchise)at the same time and trying to bring it to the market as fast as possible. This means that there are multiple, simultaneous, identical experiments all taking place at the same time, and no one knows who will win.But wait, I hear you say; doesnt the one who is first to the market end up winning since they will have the first-mover advantage? Well, not necessarily. The me too scenario also works. And not just with the Lyfts and Olas who are replicating Uber today. History also shows us this. Yahoo was the first, true large-scale search engine. It was upended by Google, which, apart from having (at the time) a better search algorithm, also quickly added other chemical reagents to the mixfree email, Web hosting, smartphone software, smart glasses and so on. The result? Googles market capitalization, as I write this, is almost 14 times that of Yahoo$517 billion compared to Yahoos $35 billion. I remember burning my fingers by investing in Yahoo prior to the dot-com burst of 2001. The stock first fell like a stoneand then remained at the bottom of the pond for years thereafter, before staging a weak comeback afterwards. Its still around, and is still a great company, but a Google it is not. And as a footnotewhile Yahoo went public in 1996, Google didnt go public until almost eight-and-a-half years later in 2004which in Internet terms is like a day and night of Brahma8.64 billion solar years, to be precise.In the interim, Yahoo, the firm, has had several chief executivesBartz, Morse, Thompson, Levinsohn and Mayer. (That string sounds almost like the name of a white-shoe law firm.) Not so Google, where, though Indias own Sundar Pichai is now CEO, the founding team of Larry Page, Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt agreed to work together for 20 years after the IPO (until 2024). Page handed the reins over to Pichai only last year, but still remains very involved.The same analogy can be drawn with our own earlier generation of labour arbitrage-based start-ups: the technology services firms. Firms like Infosys, Cognizant and Mindtree, while sometimes criticized for the collegiality of their founding teams, have ended up having had the last laugh despite having had to weather financial crises before. All said and done, Infosyslike Cognizant, Tata Consultancy Services and some other large Indian services companies with stable management teamsis now a global champion, and Mindtree is a strong contender in the next rung.Maybe there are lessons to be learnt from this for Indias array of current start-ups, which saw a market arbitrage opportunity to enter the Internet retail space before their larger global counterparts could enter the market, essentially creating the equivalent of Jack Mas Chinese Alibaba. Flipkart and Snapdeals valuations seem to have hit a wall. Much of the publicity associated with this has been focused on the fact that foreign investors, afraid of a global slowdown and unproven business models, have written down their existing investments in the sector and are unwilling to pony up more cash. And the global market leader, Amazon, has entered the Indian market in a big way.The current bearish scenario in international markets will surely change, just as it did post-2001 and then again post-2008, so the trick is just to hold on and fend off Amazons advance until the financial tide turns. Despite recent changes in the law, Amazon is after all not an Indian firm and will face more hurdles than the home-grown rivals. But, meanwhile, instead of signing long-term agreements to work together and weather what is just a simple financial stormso that they can later go public and monetize their holdingsmany senior executives at these firms seem to be using the revolving door.Just like in the movies, you can only have one or two heroes/heroines in the cast. And the same is true of the villains. Similarly each start-up can only have one or two sultans or sultanas, but constancy in the top teams is vital. Google has its Page, Facebook its Zuckerberg, Alibaba its Ma, and Snapdeal and Flipkart have their Bahl and Bansals. But the sultans need to think of Henry Fords maxim when it comes to business: Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success. A series of cameo appearances does not a blockbuster make.Siddharth Pai is a world-renowned technology consultant who has personally led over $20 billion in complex, first-of-a-kind outsourcing transactions.",2016-04-20,ZQFsl3WTYrbJ5oGFrfBQFM,"Each start-up can only have one or two sultans or sultanas, but constancy in the top teams is vital

				Turnbull assured the Indian billionaire that his government would resolve an issue with native title laws, helping take the $16.5 billion project closer to fruition,  Australian media reported on Tuesday. The native title issue surrounding the Carmichael Mine project refers to an Australian Federal Court ruling that invalidated deals with traditional land owners in that country.

He also told Adani that  the ruling had caused problems with many land deals across Australia, the report added. A quick resolution is crucial for Adani, which has invested $3.3 billion in the coal mine, railway and port project and said previously that it will start construction in the second half of 2017. An Adani spokesperson said that the meeting was very positive for the groups Australian project, but refused to comment on details. Happy to meet with Australian PM today. Working together for economic and stronger Australia- India ties, Gautam Adani posted on microblogging site Twitter on Monday evening.Turnbulls reaffirmation of his governments commitment to Adanis coal mine project comes after Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk met Adani last month at Mundra in Gujarat where the conglomerate runs a port.  In October, the Palaszczuk government exempted the project from new water laws that could have mired it in further legal challenges. The project, announced in 2010,  has run into resistance from environmentalists, resulting in delays of at least three years. Last year, the Queensland states department of environment and heritage protection (EHP) issued a final environmental authority (EA) for the project in the Galilee Basin. On 19 August, Adani won a major legal battle when the Australian apex court dismissed appeals lodged by indigenous community member Adrian Burragubba as well as a Brisbane-based environmental group against the project.ALSO READ: What next for Adani Power, Tata Power after Supreme Court order on tariffs?But that has not stopped protests.

The technology-driven world that we find ourselves in has provided us with a great opportunity to incorporate technological tools into the delivery of healthcare. Specifically, Big Data, mobile and the Internet of Things (IoT) can support and facilitate the flow of information for effective care coordination and greater patient and citizen empowerment, according to the Healthcare in 2025 report by videoconferencing, telepresence and communications firm Polycom Inc.
				   
				Big Data has immense potential in healthcare, especially when it comes to the consolidation of data to allow for more efficient and effective decision-making. Data collection and utilization through cloud systems will allow better sample sizes for prescription models, access to patient information no matter the location where they seek treatment and better allocation of limited resources.By 2020, IoTwhich is a scenario in which objects, animals or people are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interactionwill likely have 25 billion connected things, which includes more than 250 million connected vehicles, according to research firm Gartner. An Accenture report stated that IoT could add $14.2 trillion to the world economy over the next 15 years. Many believe healthcare will be a prime beneficiarywearable technology is often cited as one of the tools to support prevention and wellness in IoT, according to the Polycom report.Mobile 3G and 4G connectivity has truly revolutionized personal connectivity. When mobile integrates with healthcare delivery, the problem of accessibility reduces significantly. Virtual consultations or having surgeons in urban areas assist those in rural areas with surgeries virtually would become more feasible options; touchsurgery.com is one such example, according to the report. The potential is evident. However, the success of mobile will also depend on how governments shape healthcare policy and distribute funding, revamping the current incentive framework in many of the regions and core markets, and hiring technological experts as employees in healthcare organizations, the report notes.As collaboration between multiple parties for the future healthcare business model is a critical requirement, having a scalable network and a robust unified communications environment is necessary. The ability to integrate voice, video, content, specific healthcare applications and medical devices to support better and more efficient collaboration among clinicians, healthcare educators, administrators, patients and families will result in better patient outcomes and reduced costs, as long as its simple to use and a familiar, consistent experience.

				Mistrys aides issued a rebuttal saying the Tata Sons statement reflects desperation.It is unfortunate that Tata Sons, acting in good faith, did not anticipate such devious moves by Mr. Mistry and thereby did not inform the other directors of the operating companies about its dissatisfaction with Mr. Mistry at the level of Tata Sons. However, we will now do whatever is required to deal with this situation, the group holding company said in a statement.It added that Tata Sons had expected Mistry to resign as chairman of the group operating companies once he was ousted as chairman of the holding company and his refusal demonstrates his absolute disregard of longstanding Tata traditions, values and ethos.This is the first time since removing Mistry on 24 October that Tata Sons has elaborated on the ostensible reasons for his ouster. Since then, the independent directors of Indian Hotels Co. Ltd (IHCL) and Tata Chemicals Ltd have backed Mistry.Pointing to the first instance, the Tata note said this reveal the true colours of Mr. Mistry and his ulterior objective. It accused him of trying to gain control of IHCL by ensuring he would be the only Tata Sons representative on its board over the years. The statement said this seems to have been Mistrys strategy, planned and executed over the past four years.A person close to Mistry refuted charges of an ulterior motive of taking control of companies. He said giving the example of Indian Hotels only because independent directors, one of whom is also a director of Tata Trust, demonstrated true independence, is not in keeping with Tata governance standards, the person said.A look at the board composition of the top six listed Tata group firms where Mistry is chairman shows at least half the board was appointed before 2012, when he took charge. The Tata statement, which runs into nine pages, also cited falling dividend income and increasing impairment provisions, ballooning debt and low return on investments as reasons for removing him as chairman of the $103 billion group.Tata Sons also alleged that under Mistry, the edifice of the group founded in 1868 had been consciously dismantled, resulting in operating companies drifting away from the promoter company and their shareholders.With the exception of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), dividends received from all 40 other firms (many non-dividend paying) in its portfolio have continuously declined from Rs1,000 crore in 2012-13 to Rs780 crore in 2015-16 but the latter figure includes additional interim dividend of Rs100 crores which would have been normally received in 2016-17 (due to budgetary changes), the statement said. It added that in the past four years, the groups debt had increased by Rs69,877 crore to over Rs2.25 trillion.Despite huge investments by firms, the returns are not visible in increased profits, though, in all fairness, some major growth projects like the new steel plant at Kalinganagar will show results only in coming years, the statement said.The person close to Mistry said the Tata Sons statement had selective data, unsubstantiated claims and half truths, without a word of explanation as to why it became necessary to remove him summarily, violating natural justice and without explanation.This person pointed to the high operating profit margin of 14% for Tata Steel Europe in 2014 and the narrowing losses in the Mundra power project (admittedly because of lower coal prices) as examples of improvement under Mistry. This was the largest turnaround in Indian corporate history involving multiple companies and is still a work in progress, said this person.Proxy advisory firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS) said the Tata statement is inconsistent.You cant blame him (Mistry) for non-performance of one company and not give any credit for the good show of the other, said Amit Tandon, IiAS founder and managing director. Mistrys aide cited earlier said the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of Tata Sons lauded his performance on 28 June and its report was adopted by the entire board. Tata Sons is yet to state what necessitated the replacement of Mr. Mistry on October 24 without any notice or an opportunity to defend himself, this person said.

-0.61,"With China making rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI)-based research, it is imperative that India view AI as a critical element of its national security strategy, recommends an August 2016 report titled India and the Artificial Intelligence Revolution. Authored by Shashi Shekhar Vempati of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the report advocates spurring AI-based innovation and establishing AI-ready infrastructure as prerequisites for preparing Indias jobs and skills markets for an AI-based future and securing its strategic interests. 
				   
				Here are highlights from the report:AIs potential in IndiaThanks to the increasingly digital economy, fuelled by improving education and globalization, the Indian consumer is unknowingly the countrys biggest beneficiary of recent advances in AI, notes the report. From utilizing various applications powered by AI to using a range of online services such as Amazon Marketplace and Netflix that learn from consumers online behaviour to make intelligent product and service recommendations, consumers are readily engaged with the proliferation of AI in India, whether they appreciate it or not. Policymakers, however, lag behind, not exploiting AI for national security, public services, or other priorities.Indian academics, public researchers, labs, and entrepreneurs face a different challenge than the corporations that dominate the spacethe infrastructure necessary for an AI revolution in India has been neglected by policymakers.Why China is stealing a march in AI researchWhile lack of physical infrastructure is certainly a major impediment, Indias AI development also suffers from the paucity of the necessary cultural infrastructure, which is key for recent advances from lab to marketplace in AI. Fostering a culture of innovation and a commitment to research and, most important, nurturing an ecosystem beyond the four walls of the organization are all common to Googles DeepMind, IBMs Watson, and Baidus Institute of Deep Learning, the most successful AI projects of the past half decade.While it must come as no surprise that Google, IBM, Microsoft, Facebook, and other global technology giants have invested significantly over the decades in machine intelligence, it is the story of Baidu that holds the most pertinent lessons for India.The story of AI at Baidu is the story of Andrew Ngan associate professor at Stanford University who teaches a popular course on machine learning (also available via Coursera, an online learning platform that he co-founded). Ng was hired away from the Google Brain project in 2014, following which Baidu invested heavily in physical infrastructure. Baidu is investing in deep speech for voice-based searches that leverage speech recognition. This intelligence is being built for understanding and interpreting queries in Mandarin rather than English; as such, Baidu is constructing a uniquely Chinese platform, independent of that which is used ubiquitously in the English-speaking West.This version of AI thus offers the possibility for the development of AI in India, as an example of AI technology successfully developed in and employed by a non-Western nation. Baidus investment in AI research exposes the relative backwardness of Indias technological infrastructure: China has recognized the importance of bridging the gap between the lab and the market while nurturing a research and innovation ecosystem unbounded by national borders and corporate firewalls. India, in contrast, boasts neither the material nor the cultural institutions required for such innovation.Prime Minister Narendra Modi often challenges Indian IT entrepreneurs, asking when India will give birth to the next Google or Microsoft. But until India attains the infrastructure omnipresent in the US, and increasingly existent in China, the deep-learning capabilities necessary to address the vast linguistic diversity across India using machine intelligence may prove elusive.AIs impact on Indian jobsWhile India dreams of its own manufacturing revolution through Modis Make in India programme, it is important for policymakers to closely examine how the advent of industrial robots and their impact on manufacturing transformed companies in other developing nations.Consider the case of Foxconnone of the worlds largest contract manufacturers for electronics. In 2015, Foxconn made news when its chief executive, Terry Gou, predicted that 70% of all manufacturing in Foxconns assembly lines would be automated with robots displacing humans. Some back-pedalling later, his estimate was scaled down to 30%. Foxconn is among the top owners of robotics patents filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and produces thousands of industrial robots a year that in aggregate are capable of performing more than ten types of manufacturing tasks. This is expected to have a significant impact on the workforce: as many as 60,000 workers have been displaced by robots in one Foxconn factory alone in the Kunshan region of China.China was projected to have more installed industrial robots by the end of 2016 than any other country, with more than 30 robots for every 10,000 industrial workers. If China were to increase that density, employment would be further damaged.While the dire predictions of a robot takeover of manufacturing have not come to pass, the reality of automation is that manufacturing is unlikely to create jobs at the scale that it did in the past. Quoting the US Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2013 on future employment projections, Darrell M. West of the Center for Technology Innovation at Brookings highlights how jobs will decline over the next decade in manufacturing and information technology among other sectors.Writing in Pacific Standard magazine, Frank Levy, professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, places jobs dislocation on account of AI in perspective when he dismisses the dire projections of a robot takeover. According to Levy, the greatest area of concern for policymakers ought to be the impact of AI on jobs in the middle-skill categoryassembly line workers, clerical workers, and the like. Levy also warns of significant dislocation caused by automation leading to a reduction in an individuals potential for upward mobility. He emphasizes that a good education will be critical to acquire the necessary skills and to be competitive in this evolved labour market.In their book The Second Machine Age, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee make several specific policy recommendations for coping with the job crisis likely to be spurred by AI. A key recommendation of particular importance for India, given Modis Startup India initiative, is the need to restart startups. Brynjolfsson and McAfee view creative destruction inherent within the start-up economy as the best bet for experimenting with the new jobs and industries that can thrive in an AI-driven economy. The authors provide examples of start-ups such as TaskRabbit and Airbnb that contrive previously non-existent economic opportunities for ordinary people with spare time and assets, thus creating economically productive work.Skill development for future jobsNot everyone is as sanguine as Brynjolfsson and McAfee about the coming AI revolution. The recent victory of AlphaGo (a computer program developed by Google DeepMind) over the world champion in Go has prompted fears of the threat posed by intelligent machines that are capable of superhuman tasks. The direst warning comes from noted physicist Stephen Hawking, who apocalyptically predicts the end of the human race with the development of full artificial intelligence.In the provocative book Humans Need Not Apply, Jerry Kaplan, an American computer scientist and futurist, explores this and several other questions while attempting to paint a picture of an apocalyptic future and what it might look like if and when machines take over. Specifically, Kaplan raises two issues that should be of interest to policymakers in India. The first is the education system and the second involves skills and jobs. While discussing the likely impact of AI on labour markets, Kaplan poses the radical question: Is the current system of sequential education and work outdated, and does it require an overhaul?In his book, Kaplan also proposes a so-called job mortgage as a new type of financial instrument through which employers, vocational schools and colleges would have an incentive to collaborate in a new way. In this proposed job mortgage market, Kaplan attempts to use free market mechanisms to match current skills acquisition to future job opportunities. He proposes to accomplish this by compelling employers to commit to an intent to employ an individual in the future if that person commits to acquire a specific set of skills over a certain time frame. India will have to experiment with the kind of innovative instruments that Kaplan proposes if it is to prepare itself for the challenges from a machine intelligence-driven economy in the near future.",2017-01-23,bEcUIEcRE25IIfxv8OiXtO,"With China making rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI)-based research, it is imperative that India view AI as a critical element of its national security strategy",both,05:19,Why India needs an AI policy

As you hail the Uber cab for your business meeting, your phone beeps an urgent message and you swipe your finger on the fingerprint scanner to read the notification. You learn that a critical machine on your shop floor is overheating, and the message tells you that based upon previous experience, it is likely to break down soon. 
				   
				As a precautionary measure, the system has automatically sent a request to the in-house 3D printer to produce the component likely to be impacted. You pull out your Oculus from the briefcase, connect it to the app on the phone and get a visual of the machine and the impacted component. At the click of a button, the system also gives you three scenarios of the impact on the production if the machine goes down. You make the necessary phone calls using the low-cost WhatsApp and speak to the factory manager. Comforted by his response, your mind is clear for your upcoming meeting. What you have just done is leveraging mobile, next-generation security, Internet of Things (IoT), cognitive computing, natural interfaces and analytics technologies to perform a simple but critical management intervention which ensured the smooth running of your business. Welcome to your new world, Ms CEO. A tsunami of new technologies has hit the business ecosystem. The first ripples were felt in the middle of the last decade and were evidenced by the likes of Salesforce.com and that upstart called Amazon Web Services, Inc. What a curious idea it was for an e-commerce company to expose, and rent out, its underlying infrastructure to third parties! IDC predicts a third of all industry leaders will be replaced by 2020. Thats how profound the disruption is. On the consumer side, the waves intensified towards the end of the decade as social media took centre stage and e-commerce boomed in every single major economy in the world. As I write this, Facebook has nearly 1.8 billion users and Alibaba has sold $18 billion worth of products in a single day. Consumer services companies, vividly exemplifying the sharing economy, have become household brands: today, more millennials possibly identify with Uber and Airbnb than they do with venerable corporations such as Johnson & Johnson, and GE. The force of the sharing economy is reshaping vast tracts of the consumer ecosystem, effecting the closure of retail giants such as Circuit City and Woolworths, and acquisitions such as that of Starwood Hotels by Marriott.The waves are swamping those without the lifeboat of digital capabilities.The first intense wave of change came with technologies which created what IDC calls the third platform of computing. The four pillars of the third platform, namely social, mobile, analytics and cloud (SMAC), today aggregate to a market exceeding $0.5 trillion. According to IDC research, its still expected to grow in excess of 13% in 2016, taking more than 35% of overall technology spending. It accounts for 110% of the industrys growth: traditional IT spending, while still two thirds of overall spend, is shrinking at greater than 5% a year. The third platform of computing is a profound shift in the computing paradigm. Users have moved from millions to billions, devices from tens to hundreds of millions and theres enough data generated on Planet Earth to fill up the memory of a stack of Apple iPads all the way to the moon and back. SMAC technologies have transformed IT fundamentally, and opened up entirely new opportunities for businesses. From smart products to analytics businesses and from real-time system enabled mobile field forces to digital supply chains, businesses across the spectrum have embraced these in different ways to drive economic value. The maturing of the third platform of computing has enabled entirely new technologies, and combinations, to develop and mature. IDC collectively calls them the innovation accelerators, as our research identifies their potential to drive not just technology and process but also complete business disruption. Of these technologies, the following five are likely to take centre stage in India in 2017. Watch out for them.Next gen securityIf youre like me and have a continuous wrestling match with your store of forgotten capital letter-alphanumericchange-them-every-two-weeks passwords, then I can give you some comfort. The era of the complicated password will soon pass. Next generation security systems are integrating biometrics (fingerprint, voice, iris recognition) with behavioural analytics (usage location, onsite/on-app behaviour, transaction patterns) to help make bank accounts, health records, government databases and countless other stores of sensitive information ever more secure. Though not visible to most, the security of the networks our data whizzes around on, and of the data centres which power up the modern economy, is also undergoing radical modernization. For example, network security is not just about appliances detecting bad actors anymore: its moving to a managed services model where the network is monitored for bad actors, real-time responses become a reality and damage control processes kick in instantly in the event of a hack. From Apples fingerprint readers to behavioural security platforms being introduced by the likes of Intel Security and Cisco, the industry is racing to help us realize the possibilities these technologies unlock. Expect a new paradigm in security to make life easier, and more secure, for you in 2017 and beyond. Cognitive systemsThe notion of intelligent machines has fascinated man for decades. It has been the subject of Hollywood movies, science fiction books and doomsday theories. Well, theyve arrived but not in the way you thought. I must stress that intelligent machines of the current generation do not have native intelligence as humans do. They are getting smarter on the back of their ability to process vast quantities of data really fast, and identify patterns and trends to be used. Who knows what the next generation of machines brings, though?A common example is the May I help you? assistants, which have appeared on e-commerce websites. Increasingly, you are not interacting with a human but a piece of software if you do ask a question. It has been programmed with learning algorithms, and fed masses of product catalogue and user behaviour data to be able to help you. Intelligent machines are also parsing through all the published legal cases and court decisions in recorded history to help lawyers serve their clients better; and doing exactly the same with doctors trying to figure out what might be wrong with a sick patient. IBMs Watson platform is perhaps the best known in this space, but its not the only one. Google has a different approach with the TensorFlow and Google Cloud Machine Learning combination. The analytics platforms from the likes of SAS are evolving too, as are new-age data storage systems from NetApp, HP Enterprise and their peers. The year 2017 will see consumer services firms in different sectors adopting cognitive technologies more aggressively. Expect the likes of banks, e-commerce companies, telecom service providers and hospitals to deploy them faster than others. From a wider perspective, the full story will unfold in 2018-19. Internet of Things (IoT)The Internet today has enabled interactions and engagement in society in ways which were not imagined even a decade ago. Video calling through the phone at practically zero marginal cost, cloud computing which allows organizations to think at global scale without the need for massive technology investments and a plethora of consumer services at your doorstep are just three manifestations of the amazing power of the Internet.The next wave is now upon us: machines are now interacting with each other and triggering processes without human intervention. In the process, mountains of data are being generated daily, enabling machine learning and cognitive computing. This is IoT. The 2016 IDC IoT survey in India, which covered 470 companies, reveals a great enthusiasm for IoT already. Process manufacturing companies as well as logistics services and trucking firms are leading the way. The Industrial Internet is born. The year 2017 is likely to see the inflection point of IoT adoption in India. Billions of sensors will help monitor oil pipelines remotely, control home air-conditioning systems and track trucks and pallets as they move through our vast countryside. Its potential is staggering, its promise mouth-watering. It can generate crores of rupees worth of efficiencies and productivity gains in the corporate sector; for consumers, it could mean being able to switch on your air conditioner before you reach home; or your coffee machine grinding the beans when the sensors in your bedroom note that youve up.  3D printingAt a recent conference, Anand Mahindra, chairman of the Mahindra Group, shared that they had put a 3D printer in a school as part of corporate social responsibility and R&D initiatives. The group was keen to see what innovation the children might come up with if they are given the right tools. The results are awaited but early signs are promising. The term 3D printing, in some ways, is a misnomer. They are actually capital goods equipment which operate visually like printers do. In the future, this technology is likely to radically remake manufacturing. Supply chains will be disrupted and the manufacturing process for many products will be democratized, with the possibility of garage-based production and retail store production already being realized. Nikes Fly Knit shoes are made in-shop after your foot is scanned and the images sent to the 3D printer. Skin grafts have been synthesized in labs; auto parts are being 3D printed. In 2017, we will see the gradual influx of these machines into manufacturing firms, research labs and the possible odd hospital. It will take some time and price cuts before 3D printers go mainstream. But it holds much promise and would be especially useful for far-flung areas of the nation. Natural user interfacesWhat I wouldnt give to not have to get up for the remote control, and simply change the channel on the television with a swipe of my hand, or through a conveniently placed gadget that would recognize my voice and change the channel! Thats Natural User Interface (NUI) for you and its here to stay. But really, while that TV remote is still important, a lot of what we experience is now being redefined by new forms of cognitive controls. The shift from text to graphics was a major leap, courtesy of Xerox Corpo ration, and popularised by Apple with their hallmark Macintosh OS in 1984. More recently, weve witnessed a revolution of sorts in the UI space: touch (smartphones), voice (Siri) and even gesture (Microsoft Kinect, Nintendo Wii).Today consumers want amplified, immersive and authentic experiences from what they consume; NUI enables just that. The human-machine interface is fast changing our experiences, thus heralding an era of multi-touch surfaces, powerful and lightweight mobile devices and now the emerging market of wearable technology. We are entering a fascinating world sans constraints physical and virtual.On the enterprise side, firms today are increasing the connect with their ecosystem of customers, employees, suppliers and partners, moving away from mere CX (customer experience) to authentic experiences. At IDC, were seeing this extensively in media and gaming; it is a matter of time before NUI permeates retail, healthcare, fashion and automobile verticals. It is my considered view that when the neural capabilities of touch, voice and gesture and the capable hardware thats available to process these inputs (at consumer prices to boot) are coupled with the large scale APIs to leverage these NUI opportunities, a new age of platforms which can redesign and revolutionize your experience will dawn. 2017 shall be a year when the increasing clamour for experience by consumers and the omni-experience transformation needs of enterprises shall see a scaling up of investments towards this aim. As this technology transformation evolves, so too will its impact on consumer experience and the digital business ecosystem.In sum, 2017 will see the next technological revolution reshaping Indian society, business and the government landscape. Recent events have already triggered the digitalization of the payments ecosystem at warp speed. The five technologies described above, individually and in combination, will herald the dawn of the next technological age.Jaideep Mehta is managing director, IDC India and South Asia.Five trends that can change the tech world by 2021Internet-of-things (IoT) software and solutions: IoT will be driving new levels of customer insight and engagement for some by 2021, but technology diversity and the need for organizational changes will still stymie or delay many firms.

0.39,"Steve Hasker, global president and chief operating officer at Nielsen Holding plc, was in India to meet clients and speak on the growing importance of mobile in advertising at the Mobile Marketing Association conference in Gurgaon. 
				   
				During the trip, he met executives from PepsiCo, Nestle, Reckitt Benckiser, Tata group, BARC India and Facebook, among others.India is a very important market for us. The visit was to ensure our success continues and we stay connected with clients, Hasker said as he explained the importance of Nielsens newly launched Total Audience Measurement tool in the US. Edited excerpts:What does Total Audience Measurement include?Total Audience Measurement, thats been launched in the US, has the ability to measure any piece of video, audio or text, on any device at any time and to do it seamlessly and consistently. It has an advertising measurement component and a content measurement component and the ability to put them together. It obviously has a TV, PC, connected device and tablet, and smartphone component and in the US, we have rolled out all those pieces.Here in India, we have started with the digital ad ratings. So, we started with the advertising component. In the coming months, we look to launch the content ratings. But Total Audience Measurement is more than just digital?What Total Audience Measurement does is, it takes all the digital touch points and combines with TV advertising. So, for any campaign, an agency will say, okay, I should think about TV relative to these digital touch points. Should I buy more TV or less TV? This is very important because different markets have different objectives in terms of reach and frequency. Right now, Total Audience Measurement is available in the US; but we have also launched in Mexico and a version of it in Brazil.When will you introduce it in India?To a large extent, that is dependent on BARC (Broadcast Audience Research Council). They have the TV data. In theory, we could do it today because BARC data and digital ad ratings are consistent; but it requires an advertiser to put those two together.Is linear TV declining?What we have seen in a number of countries is the pressure on TV ratings. The size and frequency of audiences watching television has come under pressure in some of the more developed markets like the US, UK and Australia. And that has meant growth in terms of time spent on digital devices. However, what marketers are trying and have now started to understand is that TV has a reasonably unique value proposition in terms of the ability to tell a story to consumers in a way that is accepted by them. And that many large brand campaigns need a TV component. So, the ability to come out of TV altogether and going to digital was overstated. Particularly in 2016 in many markets, we have seen a reversion back to TV and more reliance on TV from an advertising perspective. But the UK and US numbers suggest digital ad revenue has surpassed TV numbers.In the UK, digital surpassed TV a number of years ago; and in the US, it has surpassed in the past 18 months. Those numbers are for real. But this year, in what we call the upfronts which is the mechanism of buying and selling advertising on TV in US, we have seen some reversion back to TV. What a number of major advertisers found that they probably swung the pendulum too far toward digital; and in doing so, they saw some decrease in reach of their campaigns to their target audience. Was losing Indias TV market to BARC a big setback for Nielsen?We certainly enjoyed being part of the TAM joint venture (between Nielsen and Kantar Media owned by WPP Plc) for quite a long period of time. We are very supportive of BARC. We met BARC and have a good relationship. Wed like to help them if we can. So we are looking forward. We think therell be an opportunity to do that. Which are the successful digital models globally? What we have seen in the last couple of years in the US and many countries is the emergence of truly spectacular digital models. One of course is Google with its search model thats been extended to YouTube. And the second is Facebook. In fact, Google, Facebook and, increasingly, Snapchat are proving to be very successful digital models partly because they have attracted disproportionate amounts of consumer time and attention and partly because they have an economic model which is very efficient. Facebook announced last week it had 4 million advertisers. And one of the great things about Facebook and Google platforms is that for an advertiser, they are extremely easy to use. You can target a particular audience and you can buy using your credit card So for advertisers and agencies, it is a great model. It is also a highly profitable model.What about newspaper publishers?It is more difficult for traditional publishersnewspapers or magazines or what we call pure play digital content websites and portals because the audiences access their content through Google, Facebook and Snapchat. In other words, the means in which they get content is through one of these larger players and, secondly, the time and attention is smaller on their properties.So, whats their future?In an increasingly fragmented and complicated world, great journalism, great video production, great TV production is not easier to do. So, even though we have got this great democratization of information and it is freely available in many different places, the ability to interpret news and write insightful commentary around the news, does not become easier in that environment. So, the value attached to that goes up not down.Whats happened here is that theres been a significant disruption in the distribution mechanism; so, whether it is a newspaper or a TV channel , or magazine, consumers now have many different ways to get to that content but, ultimately, the content itself has to be incredibly valuable. And now, done properly, there are more ways to monetize great journalism than there were previously. Right now, what media formats is venture capital (VC) chasing?VCs are very good at sniffing out areas of growth. So they are focused on a couple of thingsone is video. That is, players who are in the digital video space, either producing or distributing video content. Secondly, they are focused on players who have interesting data setson consumer identity or consumer behaviourpurchase behaviour or media consumption behaviour. The other place VCs are more focused on is fintechlike mobile payments and also on healthcare related apps and start-ups.Nielsen acquired Indicus Analytics in India. Are you eyeing more firms here?We would like to make more, provided they enhance our business and make sense financially. For us, India is a very important market. What is the next big thing for Nielsen?The big area of focus for us will be the connected system. We have two businesses. One measures media behaviour, the other measures consumption of consumer packaged goods and provides all kinds of analytics around that. In the media business, the big investment is Total Audience Measurement, and, as we said, we have rolled that out in many countries and we are in the process of bringing that to India. The second area is to build the connected system which links the market share data to explanatory analytics. Say, for instance, did the market share of Kinley water go up because of better product innovation like a new bottle size, different packaging or concept, or did it go up because its marketing has been more effectivetheres been more money on digital and more money on TV. Or did it go up because of in-store execution, its pricing, promotion and assortment was better. So, the connected system will, in real time, enable the brand manager of a particular brand to understand how am I doingwhat happened, why did it happen and what should I do next.So, were in the process of prototyping this with a number of clients across the world and we would look to introduce this here in India sometime next year. We are piloting it with six clients at the moment in different parts of the world. This is our biggest area of investment for the next five years.",2016-10-17,bNj32jkOPJkyiWyZYj8wxO,"India is a very important market for Nielsen, says global president and chief operating officer Steve Hasker",company,01:41,Some digital advertising is moving back to TV: Nielsens Steve Hasker
-0.41,"Mumbai: Aster DM Healthcare Ltd, which runs hospitals in India, the Philippines, and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, is likely to defer its proposed initial public offering (IPO) because of concerns over valuation of its overseas operations from which the company derives a large part of its revenues, two people aware of the development said on condition of anonymity. 
				   
				Aster DM had filed for an IPO in June last year and had received approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in November. According to the people cited above, the company was looking to raise close to $300 million from the IPO, valuing the company at around $2.5 billion. The IPO was planned for early this year, before the end of the March quarter.The key reason for the delay in the IPO is the current market condition of its overseas business, especially in Saudi Arabia, which has been badly hit by the fall of oil prices, said one of the two people. As a result, the company has decided that going ahead with the IPO will adversely impact its valuation. It has asked bankers involved in the IPO process to go slow till further notice, the person added.Responding to an email query, a spokesperson of Aster DM said, There is no change in IPO plans and we will look to launch the IPO at an appropriate time, subject to market and business considerations. The company did not disclose any timeline for the proposed IPO. In contrast, mattress maker Sheela Foam Ltd, which received Sebi approval for its IPO around the same time as Aster DM, listed successfully in December, raising around Rs510 crore.In its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP), Aster DM disclosed that its overseas revenues might be impacted due to fall in oil prices globally. The company said that in Saudi Arabia, where a substantial portion of its revenues are derived from patients referred and funded by the ministry of health, a decline in oil prices and the overall economic conditions have had a direct impact, resulting in an increase in receivables from the ministry of health. In order to counter this, the company said it was exploring other business opportunities in Saudi Arabia, including increasing its share of private insurance and walk-in patients. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully secure alternative sources of revenue in Saudi Arabia, or at all, the company disclosed in the draft prospectus.Aster DM has a diversified portfolio of healthcare facilities, consisting of six hospitals, 83 clinics and 180 retail pharmacies in the Gulf Cooperation Council states, seven multi-speciality hospitals and three clinics in India, and one clinic in the Philippines as of 31 March 2016. Asters hospitals in India are located in Kochi, Kolhapur, Kozhikode, Kottakkal, Bengaluru and Hyderabad and are operated under the Aster, MIMS or Prime brands. Its clinics in India are located at Kozhikode and Bengaluru.Aster DMs operations in India, which primarily consist of hospitals, accounted for only 12.52% of the companys total revenues in the nine months ending 31 December 2015, according to the draft prospectus. For the financial year 2014-15, GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries contributed Rs3,447.8 crore to revenue, compared with a contribution of Rs427.9 crore by the Indian operations. The company has received investments from PE funds Olympus Capital Asia Investments Ltd and True North (previously known as India Value Fund Advisors). Both PE funds were expected to dilute a part of their stake along with the promoters in the IPO.Since December 2016, four healthcare services firms have tapped the primary markets to fund their expansion plans and provide an exit to their PE investors. Collectively, these firmsDr Lal Pathlabs Ltd, Narayana Hrudayalaya Ltd, HealthCare Global Enterprises Ltd and Thyrocare Technologies Ltdhave raised almost Rs2,375 crore.

-0.81,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. reported revenues of $3.19 billion for the September quarter, marginally higher than the Streets estimate of $3.16 billion. On a sequential basis, revenues grew by 3.3%, which again doesnt look impressive for the traditionally strong September quarter. After the June quarters impressive 6% sequential growth, investors are evidently feeling let down.
				   
				But these quibbles aside, Cognizants results reiterate the fact that the company has been miles ahead of the competition this year. On a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, its revenues grew by 16.5%, after adjusting for incremental revenues from the TriZetto Corp. acquisition. In comparison, industry leader Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) grew revenues by just 5.8% y-o-y. Infosys Ltd grew revenues by 7.6% and Wipro Ltds growth stood at just 3.4%.Just a year ago, TCSs growth was higher by about 300 basis points, when it was growing at a healthy pace of almost 15%. But while its growth has slipped sharply in the past four quarters, Cognizant has done just the opposite. The latters growth rate is now almost 11 percentage points higher, an unusually high differential in an industry that is so competitive. One basis point is 0.01%.Also note that Cognizant has raised its revenue growth guidance for 2015 each quarter, for the past three quarters, while analysts have been cutting growth estimates for most Indian tech leaders. Cognizant has benefited from not having any material exposure to troubled sectors such as energy and telecom. But thats not the only reason for its outperformance. There has also been a shift in the nature of IT spending in the past year, and Cognizant, with its higher exposure to discretionary services such as consulting (58% of revenues last quarter), has gained. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a recent note to clients, Companies with inherent strength in run-the-business services are struggling to sustain momentum, while those with greater exposure to discretionary spending are gaining. Last quarter, the so-called run-the-business part of Cognizants portfolio grew by 1.5% sequentially, while growth in segments that depend on discretionary spending stood three times higher at 4.6%.As pointed out earlier in this column, Cognizant appears to have made disproportionate gains in the trend towards increasing spend on digital services. According to analysts, the companys early investments in this segment, including acquisitions it has made in the space, coupled with its consulting expertise, has helped it gain a higher share of this relatively new revenue stream.Its not that others havent had any success. TCS said after its September quarter results that revenues from digital services grew by 10% sequentially last quarter. Be that as it may, overall revenue growth numbers suggest that Cognizant has gained considerable market share this year, at the expense of large India-based IT companies. Last quarter, its incremental revenues of $426 million (on a y-o-y basis) were nearly double that of TCSs ($227 million), and higher than the cumulative incremental revenues of TCS and Infosys.This clear divergence is also reflected in the way these stocks have moved in the past yearCognizants shares have risen by over 35%, while those of TCS have fallen by 3%.",2015-11-04,beBSWzL5LdrIGeZM5tmu3H,"Cognizants results reiterate the fact that the company has been miles ahead of competition this year

Total impairments of various investments made is about Rs2,000 crore, he said. Also read: Nusli Wadia voted out of Tata Motors board but with a small victoryWadia, who has been an independent director on the board of Tata Chemicals for 35 years, said he disagreed with several proposals during the time of Ratan Tatas chairmanship up to 2012, including the proposal in 2003 for merger of the Haldia plant with the company, involving an investment of Rs347 crore. Wadia said he had warned of possible future losses from the merged entity. He and other board members had also expressed serious apprehensions on the proposal for the Rs800 crore acquisition of the Brunner Mond Group in the UK, Kenya and Netherlands, he wrote.Wadia, who is chairman of Bombay Dyeing and Manufacturing Co. Ltd, alleged in his earlier representation to shareholders that ahead of Tata Chemicalss 10 November board meeting, its managing director R. Mukundan held a meeting of senior management and asked them to sign a pre-drafted letter seeking to endorse the stand of Tata Sons Ltd. In this representation, Wadia had said that at the board meeting, which followed the meeting of independent directors on 10 November, Mukundan conveyed that in the event the independent directors chose to issue any statement which made a reference to Tata Sonss ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry, he would not permit the company secretary to issue the proposed communication. This, he had said, was a serious cause for concern on the lack of corporate governance in the conduct of the affairs of the company resulting from the undue interference by the dominant promoter.Wadia claimed that the cross-holdings of Tata Chemicals in other Tata companies are being maintained to indirectly keep the voting rights and control in Tata Sons. These large cross-holdings are in various Tata companies, including unlisted ones. If these holdings were to be disposed of, your company would be debt-free, Wadia wrote.Wadia has also served as an independent director on boards of Tata Steel and Tata Motors for 37 and 18 years, respectively.

-1.0,"Computing devices and smart gadgets are set to evolve further with sleeker designs, better security and innovative features in 2017. Heres a glimpse of how some technology companies are going about the task and trends like big data and security are aiding this evolution.
				   
				What next for Apples productivity push?Having mended bridges with the likes of International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and Microsoft, and forged partnerships with the likes of Cisco and Deloitte, Apple is in the midst of making its most aggressive push into the enterprise ecosystem. These partnerships take care of the software side of things, but the conundrum remains with the hardware. There is a definite potential of cannibalization within the computing device line-up, with the MacBook Airs, iPad Pros and MacBook Pros fighting for a common demographic, for the most part. Apple will also have to contend with some amount of criticism in 2017, with the underwhelming upgrades to the MacBook Pro line-upthis at a time when Microsoft flexed its muscles with the Surface Studio. Nevertheless, the iPhone remains as solid as ever for enterprise users.Microsofts Surface gambit: Revive the PC market?At a time when personal computer, or PC, shipments have been steadily declining, Microsoft seems to have taken it upon itself to set the benchmark in the ecosystem. And in the process, also show off what it is capable of. The Surface Studio all-in-one (AIO) with the Pixel Dial joins the Surface Pro and Surface Book portable Windows convertibles, and is indeed revolutionary. The 28-inch PixelSense display is believed to be the slimmest of its kind, and has 63% more pixels than a 4K TV. With prices starting $2,999 (Rs2,00,000 approximately), it isnt going to fly off the shelves. Though arguably, the first time ever, Microsoft has started to beat Apple at the innovation and design games, but just how they follow it up in 2017 will matter a lot. Flexing of the muscles aside, the real utility will now need to stand outand that holds true for the entire laptop and convertible market.Big data: Itll be biggerWhile there is considerable focus on smart cities, public transport and smarter infrastructure, there remains an ever-increasing need for data to make these systems work. For example, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Ford Motor Co. are collecting the cellphone location data of as many as two million Boston city residents; the idea is to create near-instant urban mobility patterns which would otherwise have taken years to collect, decipher and work on. Big data will be ever so critical for corporations, governments and also for research, and this is what will drive productivity, innovation and collaboration.Googles Pixel hardware game: A new inningsWith the Pixel phones, there has been a constant emphasis on the Made by Google aspect. It is clear that the software and services major wants to get into the hardware game, on its own terms. And so it has, wielding greater control over the successors to the Nexus smartphones. Finally, Android as a platform is shining throughunhindered, unwrapped and uncluttered. Pixel has shown just how good Android can be, but Google needs to fix bigger problemsthe world is still buying Android phones made by the likes of Samsung, Motorola and a whole bunch of Chinese brands, and they have no control over thatcustomization, lack of software updates and more. Do we see an even bigger Pixel smartphone line-up, covering more affordable price points?Security: Artificial Intelligence (AI) to prevent cyber-attacks?In todays world, cybersecurity is managed by a combination of humans and machines, with the latter usually configured by the former, and there remains genuine room for error. This is where the researchers from the MIT, perhaps, have a solution for the futurea new system called AI2. It uses machine learning to flag potential security threats and attacks. The human element remains, but the new system can actually scan and flag a lot more data than any human can.Dells ultimate ultrabook becomes flexibleThe Dell XPS 13 is perhaps the best ultrabook in the Windows laptop ecosystem.

				The scrip had already declined by about 20% from the time the bitter feud between Ratan Tata and Cyrus Mistry started. But investors hope that its UK-subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover Ltds (JLRs) robust numbers would offset the effect of the boardroom brawls has been belied.Barring consolidated net revenue of Rs66,999.7 crore that came close to the average of analysts estimates compiled by Bloomberg, the results disappointed on all other fronts. Consolidated net profit at Rs848 crore, although better than the Rs1,740 crore loss of the year-ago period, was about one-third the forecast. The company attributed this to a huge realized hedging loss and a commodity derivatives impact. A ripple effect of Brexit perhaps.Whats hard to fathom is that JLRs operating margin at 12.9% was nearly 70 basis-points below Bloombergs average. And this is excluding currency hedging losses and the unfavourable revaluation of current assets and liabilities. While details of these one-time items were not available at the time of going to press, they are large enough to hurt investor sentiment. A basis point is 0.01%.Meanwhile, the companys Indian business is facing greater distress. Stand-alone operating margin failed to mirror improvement in commercial vehicle performance. It fell to 2.7% against a forecast of around 6%, and the year-ago margin of 6.8%. In fact, the quarters robust jump in sales volume had raised hopes for a sharper earnings turnaround. This hints at weaker realizations on sales, perhaps reflecting discounts given to push sales. Net loss at Rs630 crore was higher than the median forecast of a Rs20 crore loss.Incidentally, it is the domestic entitys performance that has become a bone of contention in the Tata-Mistry fight. A media release last week said Tata Motors market share in commercial vehicles dropped from 60% in fiscal year 2013 to 40% in FY16hard to accept for a firm that has been the market leader for decades. Also, the drop comes in the last couple of years when the truck segment was northbound and when its arch-rival and competitor Ashok Leyland Ltds share has inched up. Thats not all. Tata Motors passenger car share of the overall market also plunged from 13% to 5%. That said, all investor hopes were pegged on JLR. But this too disappointed. The only silver lining among the host of negatives at this juncture is the stocks reasonable valuation. At Rs510, it trades at about 10 times the estimated earnings for FY18, which is reasonable given JLRs growth prospects. So, any management assurance that the September quarters exceptionally high losses are a one-off and strong sales numbers from JLR may see the stock recover.",2016-11-15,dJKoZ5qKObg92TdK1e8l0L,"Tata Motors Q2 profit stood at Rs848 crore, better than Rs1,740 crore loss in the year-ago period, was about one-third the forecast",company,07:47,"Tata Motors results: JLR belies investors hope, even as Tata-Mistry battle rages"

-0.47,"Vedanta group has clearly given up hope that the sale of the governments stake in Hindustan Zinc Ltd (HZL) will happen in the foreseeable future. Why else would it decide on a hefty dividend that entails a huge tax outgo and enriches the government more than anyone else? Vedanta has a 64.9% stake in HZL, but its share in the magnanimous Rs13,985 crore payout by the latter will only be 53.9%. 
				   
				The government, on the other hand, has a 29.5% stake in HZL, but gets 41.5% share of the spoils. This is thanks to the dividend distribution tax of over 20% that firms have to bear while paying dividends. A number of companies such as Wipro Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd have used tender buybacks as a means to return cash to shareholders, given the large amount of tax savings. Vedanta, unfortunately, doesnt have that luxury. Because of a Supreme Court order that has stayed the sale of the governments residual stake in HZL, it may not be able to participate in a tender buyback offer. And if the company were to go ahead with a buyback without the government participating, that would result in a drop in the governments shareholding, which may again flout the apex courts directives. As such, dividends seem to be the only option left to take cash out of HZL. From Vedantas point of view, the ideal outcome would be to buy the governments stake and then use its control over the company to directly pursue inorganic opportunities such as its interest in Anglo American Plc. Now, apart from gifting the government a disproportionate share of HZLs cash, it also has to share the companys cash with its minority shareholders, as well as those of Vedanta Ltd and Vedanta Plc (see chart).Analysts at Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd say Vedanta could use the funds to service some of its debt and to fund its stake purchase in Anglo American. Depending on the extent of upstreaming at Vedanta Ltd and Vedanta Plc, the ultimate promoter entity (Volcan Investments Ltd) could receive $220-$500mn of dividend which could come in handy in pursuing its Anglo American ambitions, wrote the analysts  in a note to clients. Upstreaming refers to dividend payments by Vedanta Ltd and Vedanta Plc from their respective dividend income. In other words, Volcan may eventually get only 20-23% of the total payout by HZL. From HZLs point of view, while the outflow looks huge, it hardly poses much of a problem for it. As of 31 December, the companys net cash and cash equivalents were Rs25,319 crore. Post the dividend payouts, its cash balance is expected to drop to Rs15,000 crore, point out analysts from Edelweiss Securities Ltd. But that shouldnt worry investors. Edelweiss pegs free cash flow generation at Rs10,000 crore each for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 on the back of robust zinc price outlook and capacity ramp-up. HZL shares have risen about 88% in the past year, thanks to the rally in zinc prices. But as Credit Suisses analysts point out, valuations are rich. Even with our bullish Ebitda estimates, the stock is trading at a high 8x EV-Ebitda multiple: valuations have rarely been this rich, they said in another note on 6 February. EV is short for enterprise value, and Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. HZLs shares have been more or less flat since, while zinc prices have averaged at around $2,800/tonne, about $100/tonne lower than the levels the broker has used for its earnings estimates.",2017-03-24,doyLFuwB5gJVUzNY0UGt9K,Vedanta has given up hope of a govt stake sale in Hindustan Zinc.

-0.2,"Way back in 1976, management guru Peter Drucker wrote: Whenever an institution malfunctions as consistently as boards of directors have in nearly every major fiasco of the last forty or fifty years, it is futile to blame men. It is the institution that malfunctions. Four decades later, the Tata Sons corporate governance disaster reminds us once again that after all the regulatory reforms, after all the talk about the separation of ownership and control, company boards have still to grow a backbone.
				   
				This time, the disappointment is all the more because the reputation of the Tatas is at stake. The Tatas are an icon of Indian business, supposed to represent its best practices. They have been pioneers of modern industry in the country, their leaders have been larger than life and they have acquired so high a standing in the minds of the public that even laffaire Radia did little to take the sheen off their holier-than-thou image. So, this fiasco isnt just about the Tatas. If this is what happens in the hallowed Tata Sons boardroom, what skeletons wait to be unearthed from less genteel, more grubby, Indian company boards?Corporate governance is, at bottom, the way power is exercised over an organization. What signals does the Tata boardroom brawl send out? The unambiguous message is that whoever controls the dominant shareholding calls the shots. In this case, the Tata Trusts are the dominant shareholder and Ratan Tata, as chairman of the Tata Trusts, has full control. Whatever power Cyrus Mistry wielded in the past four years was on sufferance. That conclusion is buttressed by Mistrys letter, which cites an example: once, the trust directors (Nitin Nohria and Vijay Singh) had to leave a Tata Sons board meeting in progress for almost an hour, keeping the rest of the Board waiting, in order to obtain instructions from Mr Tata. That example and the manner of his sacking lend credence to Mistrys claim of alternative power centres without any accountability or formal responsibility. In short, Mistry is saying here that after stepping down as chairman, Ratan Tata became the eminence grise of the Tata empire.ALSO READ | Why Ratan Tatas choice in Cyrus Mistry was a little too convenientThis is not the first time an ageing patriarch refuses to go gentle into that good night, nor will it be the last. As long as the dominant shareholders back him, theres little to be done about it. Power in a company depends upon the block of shares you control. That is capitalism. Notions of shareholder democracy are fatuous. At best, company boards can aim for democratic centralism, the organizational holy grail of Leninist political parties. Small shareholders can opt to vote with their feet, as they have done in the past few days.The other message is that corporate governance norms merely serve as a fig leaf to hide the brute reality of the exercise of power within a corporation and, through it, in society. It is all too easy to go through the motions, tick all the corporate governance boxes on paper and even win prizes for it, as the Satyam fraud so cynically demonstrated. But once that thin veneer of gentility is stripped away, it allows us to glimpse the way companies really work.

-0.27,"The first green revolution, helmed by visionary scientists like Norman Borlaug and M.S. Swaminathan, born of a near-death food crisis, turned around Indian agriculture through an increase in farming land, development and use of grains hardened against pests, use of fertilizers and pesticides, multiple cropping, higher farmer credit and better irrigation techniques.
				   
				While it rescued India from starvation in the 1960s, there are dark clouds over Indian agriculture again. Over the years, our gross domestic product (GDP) has grown by 7.5% annually, but agricultural growth has severely lagged at 3%. In another 30 years time, India will have 1.5 billion people, with growing incomes, and the demand for foodgrain is expected to almost double to 450 million tonnes. Moreover, our farmers are dying; 8,000 of them committed suicide last year, that is 22 farmers every single day. Moreover, in the first four months of 2016, 100 farmers committed suicide every month in Marathwada alone.Why is this happening? Our farmers do not earn enough to feed themselves and repay their debts. Calculations show that the average farmer household in India makes Rs6,426 a month, and needs to have at least 1 hectare of land to make ends meet. However, 65% of farmers have less than one hectare, and so must take debt to make ends meet. More than 50% of farmers are indebted, and the average outstanding loan of a farmer is Rs47,000, usually at a usurious interest rate.Our current farming practices are not going to solve it. To feed our population, we need to double agricultural yield, store and transport it better, and enable it with the right insurance and credit. And to make this next quantum jump happen, what we need is a second green revolutionone not based on land, chemicals, or water but on data, digital technologies and drones. Agriculture technology, or AgTech, will fuel the digital transformation of this most ancient of all industries.I believe the second green revolution will be based on five transformative digital agri-technologies:Technology-enabled advisory: Information is power; for the farmer, it is gold, and can mean the difference between a bountiful harvest and a disastrous crop. When to harvest, where to sell the produce, how much to sell it for, what to sow next, which inputs (seeds, fertilisers, etc.) are needed, where to get them at the best price, when is it likely to rain, when will the water comefor all these questions, answers traditionally have come from a farmers experience, or the neighbouring farmers, and sometimes, an extension worker provided by the government, or a private service like Mahindra Shubhlabh. However, the new advisor for the farmer will be his mobile phone. Imagine a tech-enabled advisory app on the phone, with image-recognition, speech-enablement, vernacular languages, and powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning technology, and cloud databases. Think of a farmer who sees a diseased leaf, clicks its picture and sends it to a cloud, where the image is analysed and the details of the leaf disease sent back to the farmer, with suggested remedies, places to procure these services, and possible government subsidies available for the same. An advisory service which can answer a farmers questions on the go will be the single most powerful tool to drive up yields and productivity.Precision farming: This is a data-driven approach to raise farm yields by using GIS (geographical information system) data, soil information, and weather and environmental conditions for a specific small piece of land, by optimising the choice of crop, the use of pesticides, water and fertilisers, and the decision as to when and how to spray, till, and harvest the crop. The precise nature of this technology is especially useful for Indias very small farm holdings; 65% of land holdings are less than 2 hectares (the average in the US is 180 hectares.) It is estimated that precision farming has been responsible for more than 80% of total increase in yields of wheat, rice and maize over the last 50 years. In fact, a large pilot in India, the Tamil Nadu Precision Farming Project, raised crop yields by 60-80% for 23 different kinds of crops. Precision farming works with the use of GPS (Global Positioning System) and GIS (global information system) data, cheap IoT (Internet of Things) sensors in the soil which track moisture, Nitrogen levels, etc. and feeds the data back to an analytics engine in the cloud, which then recommends the right timing and techniques of inputs.Real-time market information: The Indian farmer sells most of his produce to a middleman for price lower than he can get, because he does not have the right, current market information. He cannot make the right decision on what to plant, since he does not know the patterns and forecasting of price. Mobile phones and cheap data plans can change all that. The e-Choupal network of ITC, for instance, has created more than 6000 e-Choupals and networked four million farmers, who exchange information with each other. A query-able content repository in the cloud can make real-time market information and analytics available to individual farmers.Tech-enabled supply chain: The farm supply chain in India is broken; we can store only 10% of the fresh produce we grow30% of it rots. Building more warehouses and cold chains will certainly help; however, technologies like IoT, bar coding and blockchain can help monitor the produce from farm to market and cut down the extent of spoilage and loss.Tech-enabled insurance: While crop insurance exists, an overwhelming majority of crops are not insured, leaving the farmer severely indebted when his crop fails. Technology and information, from sources like IBMs Weather Company and Skymet, can be used to predict weather patterns and therefore derive more precise premiums and insurance covers for small farmers. Smart contracts on blockchain-based technologies can be used for automatic pay-outs, discouraging on-ground field assessment.There are a bunch of startups and large companies operating in the AgTech area. Before Monsanto bought an AgTech company called Climate Corp. for close to $1 billion, no one paid much attention to this part of the digital wave. Climate Corp, set up by two ex-Googlers, is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their farms, and then suggests ways to ameliorate them. In India, too, scores of AgTech startups are coming up. Agrostar and Bighaat enable e-commerce and doorstep delivery of seeds, chemicals and accessories; Ninjacart, FarmerUncle and MeraKisan enable e-commerce of produce for a direct farmer-to-doorstep delivery. Cropin and Airwood are making the enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management of agriculture; Stellapps makes dairy management tools integrated with IoT, cloud, mobility and analytics; Flybird is in precision farming while Trringo, from the Mahindra Group, is building an Uber for tractors and farm machinery. AgTech specific funds and accelerators like Omnivore Partners, Villgro and Village Capital are coming up, reflecting the bullishness in the sector. The government, too, has stepped into the act with the Prime Minister launching eNAM (electronic National Agricultural Market), which aims to link 200 wholesale markets or mandis to achieve the ambitious goal of doubling farmers income by 2022.Data is the new soilFor these tech companies, data is the new soilto be mined and analysed. There is a new mathematics of farmingwhat was measured in acres is now measured in square foot, enabling more micro-farming and precision agriculture. Agriculture is being platformized, with platform models being applied to create market places and on-demand models for machinery, inputs and produce.As the digital revolution rolls across India, agriculture is its last, and most important, frontier. Today, we are seeing perhaps the dawn of the second green revolution. While there is a long way to go, the true success of Digital India will be if it helps 70% of our populationagricultural workers and farmers.The archetypal impression of the Indian farmer has been a wizened, gnarled man sitting in his parched field, shading his eyes from the merciless sun and gazing at the clouds, willing them to rain.

				Indias banks have been caught out by Prime Minister Narendra Modis unexpected and widely-praised announcement late on Tuesday of the withdrawal of Rs500  and Rs1,000 notes, part of a crackdown on tax evasion and the underground economy. The now-worthless notes account for 86% of money in circulation, leaving many Indians with little or no cash.Printing of a new Rs2,000 note is ongoing, but work has only just begun on the replacement Rs500 notes, said an official in the finance ministry, who asked not to be identified because the official isnt authorized to speak to the media. Banknote shortages are likely to continue into next month, the official added. Finance ministry spokesman D.S. Malik didnt respond to calls seeking comments.Armed soldiers and security officers were deployed outside banks to manage the growing crowds, who so far have waited patiently to exchange their currency. Banks are restricting withdrawals to Rs4,000 per person, adding to the cash shortages.ALSO READ: Banks run out of new notes, shares slumpPushpendra Pankaj, a worker at New Delhis municipal council, said he had been waiting for one and a half hours at the Canara Bank branch near Parliament House to exchange his old Rs500 notes. He said he had been told that the bank server had crashed, but was prepared to stay in line as he needed money for household expenses.Its a good move by the government to curb black money, but it is full of hassles for common people like us, said Pankaj.ATMs unpreparedCompounding the problem is the need to reconfigure the countrys 220,000 cash machines so that they can dispense the new Rs500 and Rs2,000 notes, which do not fit into the existing cash trays in the ATMs, according to Navroze Dastur, the managing director for India and South Asia at NCR Corp., which supplies about two-thirds of the countrys ATMs. Dastur said it will take some time to adjust all the ATMs. Until then, the machines can only dispense low-denomination Rs100 notes, which are increasingly in short supply.The long queues outside Indias banks are a sign that the government was ill-equipped to deal with such a huge transition, said Manoj Joshi, a fellow with the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation. The whole exercise is premised on the fact that youll be able to implement it quickly and effectively. Governments in India simply dont have that ability. The central bank in a statement on Friday said banks have enough cash though it may take lenders time to revamp the ATMs.State electionsPolitical rivals of Modis Bharatiya Janata Party were relaying images of the chaos on social media.

0.62,"Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus of Tata Sons Ltd, served as chairman of the Tata group from 1991 till 2012. He continues to head the groups charitable trusts. The groups philanthropic initiatives are wide ranging and have evolved with the changing economic conditions of the country. Starting with building institutions of repute to hospitals, to research facilities for the socioeconomic integration of the marginalized communities, the groups social engagement has been moulded and influenced by the family values of the Tatas. He talks about why poverty alleviation is key to his philanthropy, how his grandmother influenced him about how to stimulate the wealthy to give more, why access to natural resources is important to improve lives and the India Philanthropy Initiative. Edited excerpts from an interview conducted by Bridgespan in partnership with Mint:
				   
				How did you start your philanthropic journey?I grew up in a family that was driven by philanthropy. My grandmother with whom we spent a great deal of timeshe brought us up because my parents were separatedinfluenced me. We were steeped into philanthropy, whether it would be for the household staff or the person on the street. She was in fact for a period of time, the chairperson of the Sir Ratan Tata Trust. We grew up in that aura of giving back to the people or alleviating misery if we could. Formally I became involved with philanthropy when I became a trustee of the Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Were there people or incidents or experiences that you used to inform your approach to philanthropy, the formal version of it?As a young man growing up, it was the environment that I spoke of, which set the pace and the tone of my journey of how one makes contributions to make a difference.How is the Sir Ratan Tata Trust changing from its old avatar?We look at our trusts collectively. The bigger ones undertook projects of philanthropy which were very far reaching in those days, be it a cancer hospital or a hotel that would be open to Indians or donations in the interest of tuberculosis. My grandmother gave away all the homes she and her husband had all over India so that sanatoriums for consumptive people, who needed to be isolated, could be made or old peoples homes could be set up. And then a fair amount of philanthropy was in the form of alleviating individual hardships, such as funds for treatment or surgery. We give much more than we did in those days but we are trying to be relevant. We are trying to participate in research for cancer, for diabetes, getting institutes in place to make the treatments affordable and reachable to the common man, looking at agricultural inputs that alleviate poverty in a rural community. What has led to this shift broadly?I cant say that there was a motivator that was defined. For example, one of the big changes has been combating malnutrition today among infants. Just the fact that we are losing so many children in India at infancy. It took only a few weeks of research to realize that we couldnt do that without involving the mother, who is also malnutritioned. We also found out very fast that we couldnt really do much unless we focused on hygiene and sanitation. It become a holistic activity. We undertook pilot projects in eight districts across multiple states to work out the systems for this and its been a real eye-opener. We have received tremendous support from the state government whom we were working with.Any advice for a philanthropist thinking about doing problem solving?The only advice I would give is there is a lot of money that is probably less effectively used or employed because someone has not done enough research on what the problems are. One of the changes we made is that we are no longer a purely grant-giving philanthropic organization. We moved from there into being involved ourselves in some of the projects that we have, we manage them ourselves or jointly with an NGO (non-governmental organization) but not only through an NGO.In the past, we would support an NGO for eight years or 10 years and then move those funds and allocate in another place. You would assume that this community by now would be self-sustaining. But when you withdrew your funds, the NGO collapsed, the community collapsed and you become the most hated person or hated organization there is. Sustainability in development has been a new call and we realize that communities dont need handoutsthey need prosperity and dignity. So our grants today, wherever we give them, put sustainability as one of the mileposts. I mean as far as possible, the idea is to make the community self-sustaining and have the dignity which I think everybody wants. How do you measure your success ?I think to a great extent it is about trying to establish and understanding what the real problems are. You have got to define your goals effectively.What characterizes a professionalized NGO?I cant answer that particularly but sometimes its not scale. Very often an NGO tends to forget the traditional outlooks of a community and ignore it, so that what they try to dohowever well intentioneddoesnt work.What is your assessment of the current state of CSR (corporate social responsibility) in India? And what needs to be done to improve it?I have a sort of philosophical view. The CSR funds have to come from somewhere. I think there would be a fair amount of abuse of these funds and the government will have to do some regulation to make sure that these are effectively used. It would not be a bad thing if the government had defined X number of causes to which you can officially give these funds, which would work for rural prosperity. I think even if large projects, a public works projects, were funded in this way, there is nothing wrong in that but the government may have to define what they are. CSR could become an avenue for innovative thinking on how you can improve the quality of life, and it could be a very powerful toolor it could be wasted. How do you see the state of philanthropy in India?I think the new type of philanthropy that we talked about, that is looking at making donations or making funds available in far-reaching terms, is starting to happen. But a large amount of philanthropy is in the more traditional formsmaybe to build temples or hospitals, not so concerned about what it actually does, but that edifices are created because that establishes that you did A or B or C. I think India has to move like other countries into a more sophisticated form of philanthropy which makes a difference and is designed to make a difference rather than just creating edifices. Do you have a philosophy of philanthropy?If I put it into one sentence, I think you really want to be doing things that make a difference. If you cannot make a difference, if its just water trickling through a tap or leading through a drainage system, its wasteful. Have you changed because of the philanthropy? How has it affected you?Yes I think so. I was the chairman of the trust while I was chairman of Tata Sons. I may have chaired the trust but I didnt spend as much time or have had much depth of involvement as I do today and thats been an eye-opener. I have become more sensitive to the pain and the suffering that exists. I am more involved with where we should do more and where we should be bolder in terms of the amount of money that we allocate. And it also made me more sensitive to the likely abuse of funds.The Bridgespan Group, an adviser and resource for mission-driven leaders and organizations, in partnership with Mint interviewed several philanthropists across India to trace their journeys and share their learningsConversations with Remarkable Givers: India.ALSO READ | Philanthropy benefits the philanthropistALSO READ | How a small donation secures freedomALSO READ | Strategic giving for impact",2016-10-03,eZ5raUtIs7kmScXuchQY9M,Tata Sons chairman emeritus Ratan Tata on why poverty alleviation is key to his philanthropy and why access to natural resources is important to improve lives,company,03:03,You really want to be doing things that make a difference: Ratan Tata
-0.57,"The Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) stock has gained 27% since its December quarter results. However, the appreciation is attributable less to its performance and more to anticipation that Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (the companys telecom business) may perform better than expected.
				   
				When RIL announces its March quarter results too, investors will be keenly watching out for updates on Jio, apart from the companys downstream projects and its capex plans. Its March quarter results are expected to be good despite the fact that the benchmark Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) has declined about 5% sequentially to $6.4 a barrel. Analysts expect RIL to report better GRMs during the March quarter.According to analysts at Nomura Research, RILs premium to Singapore GRM will likely improve (the December quarter had a shutdown of the fluidized catalytic cracking unit; also Brent-Dubai crude spreads were favourable). Petchem (petrochemical) earnings will likely increase further both as Reliance benefits from higher volumes (new capacities) and firmed up margins particularly in aromatics chain, pointed out Nomuras March quarter preview for the oil and gas sector.GRM is the realization from turning every barrel of crude oil into finished products and is an important measure of profitability for refining firms.Even as RILs numbers may bring good tidings, expectations from oil marketing companies (OMCs)Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Indian Oil Corp. Ltdare not rosy. Analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd expect weaker earnings for OMCs due to inventory losses in both refining and marketing, and lower core GRMs year-on-year. With oil prices declining towards the end of the March quarter, OMCs are expected to report inventory losses. However, full year consolidated earnings should surprise positively, particularly for HPCL and BPCL, due to strong performance in subsidiaries in FY17 vs FY16, said Jefferies in a report to clients on 6 April.On an average, crude oil prices rose year-on-year and that will reflect positively in price realizations of upstream companies such as Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd and Oil India Ltd. Investors will have to keep a tab on output numbers and production outlook in the near future. So far, both these stocks have underperformed compared to their peers in the oil sector.

0.07,"Chatbots turn specialists
				   
				 When people react to news about chatbots, it has more to do with what they can potentially do sometime in the future, than what they probably experienced with an existing one. The experience would go back a long way. Eliza, a chatbot created in the 1960s, has given endless entertainment to generations of coders during their breaks. In its early days, Yahoo Messenger came with a chatbot. These experiments revealed something about human fascination with machines that can mimic humans. They underscore why the format will work. In the media sector, the Quartz app and The New York Times Facebook Messenger have adopted this format. They have a great user interface, and give the users a distinct feel of chat.But the real disruption is happening at the back-end. If phase one of this change happened through intelligent personal assistants such as Apples Siri, Microsofts Cortana, Amazons Alexa or Google Assistant, phase two is where these assistants become specialists. Bank of America (BoA) announced the launch of its chatbot Erica, which will sit in BoAs mobile app, analyse customers financial data and give recommendations. Similarly, Mastercard announced a chatbot that will work on Facebook Messenger to help solve customers problems. IBM has joined hands with Slack Technologies to make its slackbot more intelligent and be able to help a companys tech department. IBMs computer system Watson will do a good part of data crunching.Watson, which became a part of public conversation a few years ago after winning TV game show Jeopardy, is already crunching data in other verticals. One of the most useful areas it is looking at is oncology, to help doctors treat cancer more effectively.There has long been a debate on whats better, being a generalist or being a specialist. At one point, it seemed that a good personal assistant would be both, a generalist and a specialist. But it looks like that division will persist. But all of them will still fit into our pocket.Economist and professor Pankaj Ghemawat, in his thought-provoking book World 3.0: Global Prosperity, How To Achieve It, pointed to the fact that the world is not flat. Despite all the advances in communication technology, trade and transportation, things tend to stay within the borders. Views on privacy is one such. Recently Alibabas founder Jack Ma urged China to use big data to combat crime. The example he gave included a person using e-payments to travel in 50 different buses in a single day (a potential pickpocket), and a person who orders a pressure cooker, a clock, steel ballsall at the same time (a potential bomb maker). His remarks made several Western observers, especially privacy advocates, cringe. Its not clear how the Chinese took to his remarks. This came at a time when China is reported to be launching a social credit system.Meanwhile, regulators in the West are tightening the screws on how companies can share their data. The US Federal Communications Commission approved new rules that prevent broadband providers from collecting data about their customers. Article 29 Working Party, the European data protection supervisor, has questioned the recent changes in WhatsApps privacy policy, in which it said it would share data with its parent company Facebook. There is tremendous pressure from civil society as well. For example, Reuters reported that Digital Rights Ireland, a privacy advocate, has challenged an EU-US commercial data transfer pact saying it doesnt have enough privacy protection. While the US has traditionally dealt with the privacy question by strengthening its technology (the Apple-FBI fight is an example), Europe preferred the legal route.Both come with the risk of loopholes, and those in charge of data havent shown much enthusiasm when breaches happen. The disclosure of Yahoo accounts getting hacked came years after it happened. These risks will only go up as the world gets more digital. Recently, researchers from three universitiesthe Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU), the Singapore University of Technology and Design and the University of South Alabamacame together to demonstrate that its possible to hack a 3D printer to make invisible changes to the design. Life is convenient in a digital world, but there are also security and privacy risks. How we balance the two will be one of the biggest challenges in the coming years.There is only one difference between a bad economist and a good one, economist Frederic Bastiat wrote in his famous essay, That Which Is Seen and That Which Is Not Seen: The bad economist confines himself to the visible effect; the good economist takes into account both the effect that can be seen and those effects that must be foreseen. He might have added to that list, the back-end. Its definitely true of cryptocurrencies. A lot of attention has gone towards bitcoins, the rise and fall in the price of the currency, and trying to figure out who created it. Meanwhile, whats turning out to be disruptive is its back-end, blockchain, the automated open public ledger. Its finding new applications, and helping in removing inefficiencies.Cross-border trade is one example. It involves multiple time zones, and multiple payment processing, resulting in delays. Recently, two banks, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Wells Fargo, processed a cross-border trade of cotton from the US to China for an Australian trader using blockchain technology. Mortgage is another. Bank of China and HSBC recently announced that they will use it to speed up home loan processing in Hong Kong.Its not restricted to the finance sector. Disney recently revealed that it was working on its own blockchain called Dragonchain. Its not clear how the entertainment major will use it, even though blockchain fans have been speculating on applications ranging from a new currency that visitors will spend in its theme parks to a points system for different games.

0.83,"Bengaluru: Bhaskar Bhat, 62, has been at the helm of Tata group firm Titan Co. Ltd for nearly 15 years. His association with the Tata Watch Project, which eventually led to the creation of Titan, has continued for more than three decades, during which he has seen the Titan brand expand from watches into jewellery, eyewear and precision engineering.
				   
				About four months ago, Titan entered yet another categorytraditional womens wearas part of a pilot project, while watches and jewellery continue to be its mainstay, accounting for a major portion of its revenue. Unlike the jewellers in the unorganized sector who have been hit by demonetization, Titan expects the governments move to help boost its sales in the longer run. The company estimates it has less than 5% market share in jewellery and therefore abundant headroom for growth.As of now there are no acquisition plans in the pipeline, says Bhat, and the companys focus is on integrating brands such as CaratLane in jewellery and Favre-Leuba in watches and Maison Montblancwhich makes jewellery, writing instruments and leather goodsas all these were acquired less than two years ago. In an interview, Bhat spoke about the companys key business segments and the fillip it expects from demonetization. Edited excerpts:How has this fiscal year shaped up so far and what kind of growth rate do you expect over the next two years?Overall, like we reported, we had been growing in the first six months, by a small amount, but still, growth was there. In fact, we even said that were expecting a 15% growth in the jewellery business and we expect to clock those numbers. In watches also, the growth rates are better than last year. So the year as such is better, that much I can say. We will be able to keep our current rate of growth, i.e. 15%. Whether it will be much more for FY18 and the year after, we cannot say. But for us FY18 will be better than the current year primarily because demonetization has, in a way, sucked the winds out of the sails of the unorganized sector. Do you expect any fallout from demonetization on Titans future performance? Right now I can confidently say that the concerns because of demonetizationfor instance, concerns that there is no cash for daily transactions so I wont buy watcheshas diminished considerably. It was an event that has affected most companies and we have also articulated that we did get affected in the first week to 10 days. After that, normalcy has come back; the informal (unorganized) economy was affected whereas it has not affected us. In the end, consumers have to buy jewellery, watches and eyewear. If the unorganized sector is not able to give them the product, theyll have to come to us, right?Companies that were doing business in black will not be able to transform to our kind of model or any other kind of model where you accept credit cards and cheques, you keep your books of accounts and you pay taxes. Thats not a transition which will occur easily. And that is where the demand which is there, fundamentally, will flow to companies that can and have been operating legitimately.Youve said in the past that the jewellery industry will be full of turmoil due to policy changes. Is that still your expectation, in particular for this year? Over the past two years, there has been considerable turmoil in the jewellery industry. Gold-on-lease was stopped and later restored, customs duty was increased from 6% to 10%. Then excise duty was introduced and, if you remember, stores were closed for 43 days. Disclosing PAN cards was introduced for purchases above Rs5 lakh and then further dropped to those over Rs 2 lakh. And then we had demonetization. But I think jewellers have now learnt a lesson. At what rate the government decides to impose GST (goods and services tax) is the only other policy change in store and that will benefit us because a lot of the jewellers will have to fall in linedemonetization plus GST is a nightmare for them. So we should benefit from FY18 onward.Which of your jewellery brands are you betting big on and do you expect sales from your Golden Harvest Scheme (GHS) to get a significant boost going ahead?There is a lot of excitement in CaratLane, which we acquired, and Mia. Both are appealing to younger consumers. But between Tanishq, Mia, Zoya, CaratLaneTanishq is certainly the biggest brand. It is a very steady high-growth brand and is at a very high level of sales. Sales from GHS are basically advance booking orders; so youve got a guarantee that one year later at least this much business you will do. Its always been 15-20% of our sales. We aggressively push GHS. Maybe its contribution to sales can increase a little more but I dont see it becoming the new normal.Watches and eyewear have not been doing too well. Whats the plan to boost sales? Watches are bought today as an accessory, not as a time-keeping device. So the strategy is clearly accessorization and premiumization. Getting into the smartwatch segment is also a strategy that weve introduced and were doing well at it. Eyewear has been slow this year, yes. Right now the effort is in ensuring existing stores grow rather than new stores. Growth will come out of the so-called same-store sales growth mantra. Is Titan planning to enter any new categories? We began piloting traditional womens wear in October and are looking at opening a physical store. And we still have to grow perfumes, for example, which is still at a level of Rs30-40 crore. So we dont have any other category in the pipeline. What is your strategy when it comes to competing with online marketplaces? We participate, we dont compete. In watches, we are with online marketplaces like Flipkart and Myntra, and we have a strict contractual obligation with them as to what price they can sell our products at. Discounting is at our behest, not theirs and they have agreed to this so theyve become a partner. The biggest advantage we have is we have offline stores. Our strategy has always been omnichannel but there are very big advantages of bricks and mortar, which I think bricks-and-mortar companies need to play up and not just assume that everybody is going to migrate to online. The need to go to a store is least in watches, because watches you can buy online also, and highest in jewellery. The higher the ticket size, the more risk-averse people will get. So convenience is not everything when you are buying. And I think this trend of buying eyewear online is a passing phase. People will realize that unless you get the quality that you want, it can be quite bad. If your lens is not good enough, for example, its a risk. You also cant touch and feel your frame (before placing an order online). Youve been associated with Titan, and earlier the Tata Watch Project for about three decades. What would you say is the one significant event in the history of the company? We didnt know a thing about retail. So the first retail store we opened in Safina Plaza (a shopping complex in central Bengaluru) in the late 1980s was very memorable. It was a 350-square-foot store but it was very well designed. I remember we sold 17 watches on the first day and we were very thrilled! That was a significant event in the life of Titanthe introduction of retailing.When you look back, I dont think we ever dreamt that we would be a watches, and jewellery, and eyewear, and precision engineering company. It was inconceivable. We were just about relieved that wed got government approval to get into the watch industry and that we were able to make good watches and overtake HMT in five-six years. After that, its been kind of a dream run.",2017-02-04,eokVM94g0SpP1h72Lt1VFO,Titan MD Bhaskar Bhat on integrating brands such as CaratLane  and why he expects the jewellery business to get a boost from demonetisation,company,00:41,"Titan will maintain current growth rate over two years, says Bhaskar Bhat"
0.36,"Wipro Ltd reported another quarter of sluggish revenue growth; in constant currency terms, revenue grew just 0.9% in the September quarter. Besides, it has guided for growth of only 0-2% in the December quarter.
				   
				But investors have got used to sub-par growth rates from the company. Whats unusual is the aggression it has shown lately in trying to get out of this low-growth rut.On Thursday, Wipro announced the acquisition of Appirio Inc., a US-based cloud services firm for $500 million. The firm has annual revenue of less than $200 million, implying a pricey tag of around 2.5 times revenue. Note that such firms typically operate with single-digit operating margins, which means the price-earnings valuation of the asset may be as high as 50-70 times.Analysts are convinced the deal will be earnings dilutive in the near term. But they are also excited about the companys prospects. Appirio is one of the largest independent cloud services implementation partner for SaaS (software as a service) vendors such as Salesforce and Workday. Wipro  also gets access to one of the largest crowdsourcing communities called Topcoder. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients, The acquisition leapfrogs Wipro in Salesforce and Workday implementation over other Indian IT (firms) and places it among the top-5 players globally along with IBM, Accenture and Deloitte. Besides, they said the deal would enhance Wipros ability to take this capability to its existing large clients; improves its digital positioning and also open up opportunities for integrated deals as opposed to simple reliance on implementation revenue.While Wipro is already present in this segment, revenue from the practice stood at just $40 million. Analysts at Nomura said the acquisition will put Wipro ahead of its Indian IT peers, besides helping the company transition well in the ongoing shift from on-premise software to SaaS.On 11 February, Wipro announced the $460 million acquisition of HealthPlan Services, a leading business process as a service (BPaaS) provider in the US health insurance market. It had also closed in on another BPaaS provider, Viteos, although the deal was called off after it took too long to close.

Some of the acquisitions will hurt the P&L (profit and loss) and lead to dilution of earnings.

As a result, their growth, too, has slowed, while competitors such as Accenture Plc have done far better, thanks to numerous acquisitions in recent years.Of course, the Streets response to Wipros deals has been a bit restrained. The companys shares have underperformed again this year. One reason is investors tend to be myopic and focus on short-term performance. The other is that Wipro, like most Indian IT firms, doesnt have a great track record of integrating acquisitions well. According to analysts at JPMorgan India Pvt. Ltd, Infocrossing, the companys last large acquisition, had not helped Wipro consolidate its then-leadership position in IT infrastructure-management. It was acquired for $600 million in August 2007. If anything, they add, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd took over leadership in infra-management despite Wipros large acquisition.But clearly, Wipro cant be faulted for not trying. Investors will hope that it keeps its eye on the ball and works on integration issues in its attempt to regain industry-leading growth.Investors can also take comfort from the increasing return ratios. Wipro has increased its payout ratio to 48% in fiscal 2016, from 41% in FY15 and 30% in the preceding four years.Whether the companys bets in the SaaS and BPaaS space work out well or not, investors should be pleased that Wipro is at least choosing not to sit on a pile of cash that earns poor returns.",2016-10-23,er5KBSodjk95kttSnsjrNO,"Whether Wipro bets in SaaS and BPaaS space work out well or not, investors should be pleased it is at least choosing not to sit on a pile of cash that earns poor returns",both,23:47,Is Wipro showing IT industry how to use its cash?

Despite the fact that it crossed the Rs8,000-crore mark in stand-alone net profit for the first time, the performance would have been sweeter if income from sources other than its main business had not played a key role in boosting profit. 
				   
				Notably, while RILs gross refining margin (GRM) improved to $10.8 a barrel from $10.1 a barrel in the September quarter, the measure was lower than expected, considering that the benchmark Singapore refining margin had done much better sequentially.GRM is the realization from turning every barrel of crude oil into finished products and is an important measure of profitability for refining firms.RILs petrochemicals segment performed well but that couldnt compensate for the disappointment from the refining business. However, investors have little to complain given that the stock has appreciated as much as 21% till 17 March since RIL announced it will start charging its customers in the telecom business. Further stock appreciation will be dependent on how the telecom venture fares in the days to come.State-run refining and marketing firmsBharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and India Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL)delivered a decent performance. Reported GRMs improved sequentially. Inventory gains helped. According to analysts from Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd, core earnings, adjusted for inventory gains, came in at Rs12.7/12.1/7.6/ share for BPCL/HPCL/IOCL versus reported earnings per share of Rs15.7/15.7/8.4, respectively. After adjusting for one-offs, core earnings of IOCL and BPCL came in-line with our estimates but HPCL missed the mark on this metric as marketing margins disappointed, an Emkay report said last month. However, broadly, reported earnings of all three firms were in-line, according to Emkay. These stocks have done well in the past two years, helped by diesel price deregulation and improvements in earnings. A further upside can come if refining margins improve further.Meanwhile, stocks of upstream oil firmsOil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) and Oil India Ltdhave performed well in the past couple of months, thanks to firmer crude prices. However, if oil prices continue to remain range-bound, further appreciation in shares of ONGC and Oil India will be tough.

Following her resignation, the board of NSE appointed Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd chairman Anand Mahindra, former Reserve Bank of India deputy governor Usha Thorat, founder of Dhruva Advisors Llp Dinesh Kanabar and former Infosys Ltd director Mohandas Pai to choose Ramkrishnas successor.J. Ravichandran, who used to serve as group president of finance and legal and company secretary at NSE, was named the interim MD and CEO. He will serve in the position until Limaye takes charge.NSE will send Limayes name to Sebi for clearance next week and a formal announcement would be made only after the regulators approval, said one of the two people cited earlier.An NSE spokesperson declined to comment.

Sebi is also studying a forensic audit report on this issue prepared by Deloitte India.In January, Limaye was named to a four-member committee formed by the Supreme Court to manage the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).

-0.16,"The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday gave the green signal to Tata Sons Ltd to hold a planned shareholder meeting on 6 February, which will consider a proposal to remove former chairman Cyrus P Mistry as a director from its board. 
				   
				The tribunal refused to grant a stay despite being pressed by the counsel of Mistrys family investment firms, Aryama Sundaram. This bench has not passed any stay on the EGM (extraordinary general meeting) scheduled for 6th February. ... Relief (to Mistry family firms) is recused. Now either the petitioner can file an appeal or be bound by an order, said B.S.V. Prakash Kumar, one of the two members of the NCLT bench.Earlier this month, the Mistry firms filed a contempt of court petition seeking a stay on the Tata Sons EGM. This has been dismissed by the NCLT, which asked the firms to club it with their original petition alleging mismanagement of Tata Sons and oppression of minority shareholders. Cyrus Mistry was ousted as chairman of Tata Sons in a boardroom putsch on 24 October.The bench asked Sundaram, the counsel for Cyrus Investments Pvt. Ltd and Sterling Investments Pvt. Ltd, to argue the merits of the original petition. Sundaram asked the NCLT to first clarify whether the petition was maintainable. In its response to the Mistry family firms petition, Tata Sons had said that the two firms were not qualified to file such a petition because they didnt hold enough equity under Company Act rules.Cyrus Investments and Sterling Investments together own 18.4% of the ordinary shares of Tata Sons, but only 2.17% if preference shares are included, said the holding company of the Tata group. Similarly, the Tata Trusts, which control two-thirds of Tata Sons, said that any suit filed against them needed the permission of the charity commissioner.This (equity) class of shareholders is affected and since we form 18% of the equity shareholders, the petition is maintainable and we have the right to appeal if we feel there is going to be a change in the board. Changes in the board are done through EGMs, which qualifies equity shareholders only to vote. Since we form 18% of that class, the petition is valid and maintainable, Sundaram argued.This did not work.This bench is virtually perplexed. None of the judgments of the Supreme Court or sections of the Companies Act cited by the petitioner counsel is in relation to the matter of maintainability. Moreover, normally maintainability point will be taken from the respondent side. But here the petitioner is arguing on the point of maintainability, said Prakash Kumar.The bench expressed its displeasure, saying that the Mistry family firms counsel was not cooperating with the proceedings. The tribunal said it will not spell out the judgement on maintainability separately and will hear  arguments on maintainability only as a part of the overall arguments made on the original petition. It asked Sundaram to argue on the merits of the original petition on 13 February, the next day of the hearing. After concluding hearings on behalf of the Mistry firms, the tribunal will hear Tata Sons arguments on 20 and 21 February.While agreeing to postpone the hearing from Mistrys side by two weeks, Prakash Kumar said, The petitioner counsel cant argue on the matter and is only asking for adjournment. Content in the petitioner counsels argument is a clear recusal from the direction given by the court. The meaning is that he cant and is not ready to argueThe road map was already laid out on 22 December and thereafter on 18 January. As the court earlier said, there was enough time given to the petitioner counsel. After the hearing, Sundaram told reporters that the Mistry family firms will look at other options to get a stay on the 6 February EGM.Now we may want to take other remedies against the order (the oral order allowing the EGM on 6 February) so we asked (for an) adjournment, said Sundaram.",2017-01-31,fYoDQOVgWTMiVp90MagHXM,"NCLT to next hear counsel for Cyrus Mistrys family firms on 13 February, Tata Sons on 20-21 February",company,23:44,"NCLT clears Tata Sons EGM on 6 Feb, asks Mistry counsel to argue first petition"

0.01,"Singapore: Whats a nice round figure to take to a job interview? If the position in question is chairman of Tata group, there might be three of them: $40 billion; 2020; and 250 basis points.
				   
				Thats the value of the Indian conglomerates outstanding debt, and there are several reasons it needs to be discussed before pay and perks.For one thing, investors will hound the next chief for answers. About 90% of the Tata loans and bonds are on the books of publicly listed companies whose shareholders are nervous about the recent sacking of the groups chairman after less than four years at the helm.Market value of Tata groupCyrus Mistry has lashed out against his dismissal by warning of a possible $18 billion in asset writedowns. Discount that estimate for wounded pride, but theres no denying that some of the businesses Mistry described as legacy hot spots do have lousy credit metrics. Tata Teleservices Maharashtra Ltd.s debt exceeds 11 years of the wireless carriers earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Ditto for Tata Steel Ltd. The debt-to-Ebitda multiple at Indian Hotels Co., owner of the Taj group, is approaching eight times.Then theres the niggling issue of bunched-up repayments, the second topic toward which the aspiring chairman must steer the interview. Given that 30% of the Tata group debt originally contracted in US dollars, and more than 60% of the British-pound borrowings, will need to be repaid or refinanced in 2020, the next chairman must know from his recruiters what it is that they wish to tell international creditors about strategy before then.Much of the groups debt burden has its genesis in the optimistic expansion in the second of the two decades under Ratan Tata. To the extent his return (albeit as an interim arrangement) has ignited concerns that Mistrys attempts at deleveraging will get shelved, the new full-time boss will be expected to calm nerves. Otherwise, the loans market, which is currently treating even highly leveraged Tata companies with benign neglect, could turn anxious, especially if the ongoing war of words with Mistry casts a lingering shadow on creditor sentiment. A good place to start that uncomfortable conversation may be 250 basis points, which is the spread the group paid over Libor to raise five-year money this year for Tata Steel. For a company thats rated BB- by S&P Global Ratings, the global average for similar dollar loans this year has been 262 basis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Clearly, the 148-year-old Tata brand commands a decent premium in credit markets despite the dead weight of its European steel operations.That privilege could vanish if the bickering doesnt end. The 78-year-old Ratan Tata may have regained control of the conglomerate that bears his familys name, but Mistrys 18.4% stake in the holding company  and board seats across the group  give the 48-year-old a bully pulpit from which he can demand fire sales, especially of assets his older foe is fond of.A confrontation could get messy for the next chairman. Taking three crucial numbers into the interview wont guarantee success in what might prove to be India Inc.s most demanding open job, but making an appearance without them could be a surefire way to end up as collateral damage.

It also asked independent directors of group companies to consider the future of Tata companies when taking decisions. 
				   
				Tata Sons, the group holding company, has been moving aggressively to oust Mistry from group companies.Last week, Tata Sons replaced Mistry as chairman of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and called a shareholder meeting to remove him as a director from the board of the software services company.Tata Sons also moved resolutions to call for shareholder meetings to eject Mistry and Nusli Wadia, an independent director, from the boards of Tata Chemicals Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd, as the spat turns more bitter.Tata Sons actions seem to have been prompted by the independent directors of two group companies unanimously reposing their confidence in Mistry. On Thursday, the independent directors of Tata Chemicals, including Wadia, had backed Mistry as chairman of the board, citing their evaluation of his performance in the past couple of years.Earlier, independent directors of Indian Hotels Co. Ltd had said they supported Mistry to remain as chairman of their board.The Tata Chemicals independent directors resolution led to the resignation of Bhaskar Bhat, a non-executive, non-independent director on its board.Tata Sons reiterates that it is crucially important for boards, including independent directors, to consider that their views and positions ensure that the future of Tata companies is protected, taking into consideration the interest of all stakeholders, the Tata Sons statement said.",2016-11-13,gWkNsfXqYXOEnoqBRWG5iK,Tata Sons wants its independent directors to ensure future of Tata companies and interest of all stakeholders is protected ,company,21:05,Will do whatever it takes to deal with Cyrus Mistry ouster: Tata Sons

Ratan Tata, who returned to head the conglomerate after ousting Cyrus Pallonji Mistry, is looking for a partner to buy the ex-chairmans stake, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.
				   
				Should Mistry agree to sell, how much can he hope to get for his familys 18.4% of Tata Sons Ltd?Bear in mind that following his dismissal, Mistry raised some very serious allegations about both the holding company and several of its biggest publicly traded units. In hitting back at the board that fired him, Mistry said the groups net worth of $26 billion could be impaired by as much as $18 billionshrinking to just $8 billionshould writedowns be needed at businesses like Tata Steel Ltds European operations; Tata Motors Ltds passenger car business (ex-Jaguar Land Rover, the jewel in the empires crown); Indian Hotels Co.s overseas Taj properties; one of Tata Power Ltd.s plants; and a floundering wireless telecom venture with NTT Docomo Inc.As a seller, Mistry is unlikely to behave anything like a spurned chairman trying to score debating points. To maximize value, he might say he overestimated the risk of Armageddon. He might even admit the possibility that Ratan Tatas return to a conglomerate he chaired for two decades will reinvigorate the operating companies. Maybe Tata cant repeat a near sevenfold increase in book value over the period 2004-2012, but if global steel demand stabilizes, theres a fair chance the groups assets could reach a book value of $28 billion after a year. In the base-case scenario, the coffee-to-cars-to-software conglomerate wont be any worse off, and its assets would be worth in 2017 what they are today: $26 billion.Now suppose that status quo has a likelihood of 50%, while the probability of a massive writedown is 20%, and that of an improvement is 30%. That gives a one-year-forward book value of $23 billion. Considering that General Electric Co. trades at three times its estimated book value for next year, and companies in the more diversified Tata Group sell at 4.8 times, Mistry could perhaps ask for a halfway-house multiple of 3.75 times, valuing his 18.4% stake at a little under $16 billion.Only a patient investor who cares more about growth than current income would be willing to write that check. After all, the dividend received from operating companies yielded just 1.6% on Tata Sons investment last year, according to the Economic Times. An investor who paid a multiple of 3.75 to relieve Mistry of his stake would earn a divided yield of 0.4%.As for Mistry himself, at $16 billion, he would walk away with an annualized 4.5% return on the $200 million loan the Tata family took from outsiders 91 years ago. Include past dividends, and he might even have matched or beaten the 9% annual return from the US stock market since 1928. Thats hardly a divorce to feel unhappy about.

0.07,"Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd reported subdued earnings for the March quarter and gave a weak forecast for 2017-18, suggesting that Indias second largest software services company has to do more to become a next-generation services-led company and meet its target of $20 billion in revenue by 2020.
				   
				In the January-March  period, Infosys reported a 0.7% sequential rise in dollar revenue to $2.57 billion, allowing it to end fiscal year 2016-17 with a 7.4% year-on-year growth and $10.21 billion in revenue. Embarrassingly for the management, despite three downward revisions in annual growth, Infosys could manage only a 8.3% full-year growth in constant currency terms, missing the  guidance of 8.4-8.8% made in January.Net profit declined 0.8% to $543 million in the March quarter, from $547 million in October-December. In rupee terms, revenue declined sequentially by 0.9% to Rs17,120 crore, while net profit declined 2.8% to Rs3,603 crore.ALSO READ: Infosys seeks to buy peace with new co-chairman, Rs13,000 crore payout promiseA Bloomberg survey of 34 analysts had forecast Infosys to report revenue of $2.68 billion, or Rs17,283.7 crore, in the quarter. The analysts estimated the company to report a net profit of $554.4 million, or Rs3,564.1 crore, in the period.Infosys expects its dollar revenue to expand between 6.1% and 8.1% in 2017-18, lower than the growth projected by Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., which follows a January-December fiscal year and  expects to grow between 8% and 10%. In constant currency terms, Infosys now expects 6.5-8.5% growth for the full year.Infosyss lower growth guidance of 6.1-8.1% in 2017-18 means the firm expects less incremental revenue this year. In 2015-16, it reported a 9.1% growth and did $790 million in incremental business. In 2016-17, it managed $707 million in new business. The guidance of 6.1-8.1% means it expects to add between $600 and $800 million in new business.Q4 results: Has Infosyss recovery dissipated before it even started?Another area of concern is Infosyss lower profitability estimate of 23-25% for the current fiscal yearit has operated in a 24-26% band over the last few yearswhich implies that even as the firm sees pricing pressure for commoditized deals, it has been unable to sell more value-added services.Even though chief executive Vishal Sikka has tried to make engineers embrace newer ways of design thinking and tried to steer the firm to focus on building platforms, for now, it is struggling to change the way it has traditionally done business. This is the biggest worry ahead for the management, with the firm appearing to be unable to scale up business from newer offerings even as the core services business appears to be structurally breaking down, according to two equity analysts and one industry executive. This fact is disappointing because until the start of last fiscal year, Infosys appeared to be in the early stages of a turnaround.ALSO READ: Infosyss Rs13,000 crore payout falls short of what investors needWe believe the top-line weakness and the lower-than-expected FY18 guidance is driven by the application services (Infosys had the highest exposure of 64% of its revenues to application services among peers in fiscal 2016) weakness (amid threat from cloud and SaaS, or Software as a Service) and  low penetration in digital services, Goldman Sachs analysts Sumeet Jain and Saurabh Thadani wrote in a note after Infosys declared earnings.Still, the management put up a brave face. Yes, we have had challenges but I think we are progressing well despite all the macroeconomic challenges, pricing pressure and the distractions we have had over the last quarter,  Sikka said. The distractions he is referring to are the two public spats between Infosys co-founder N.R. Narayana Murthy and the board, where the former raised issues of corporate governance and disproportionately high salaries to the CEO and COO.Although Infosys will likely grow faster than both Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Wipro Ltd in 2016-17, its growth is lower than the 8.7% reported by Cognizant in 2016. TCS declares its earnings on 18 April and Wipro declares its fourth-quarter results on 25 April. Industry body Nasscom also avoided giving a growth outlook for Indias $150 billion outsourcing sector in February, on account of the uncertain macroeconomic outlook.In order to get the stuttering sales engine firing again, Infosys needs to articulate its strategy in a more nuanced way and drive it through the organization, said Thomas Reuner, managing director of IT outsourcing research at HfS Research. Infosys urgently needs to focus on sales execution.Investors punished the stock, which fell 3.71% to Rs932.90 on  BSE at the close on Thursday, dragging the benchmark Sensex down 0.61% to 29,461.45 points.Infosyss poor performance also hurt Sikka, who earned $6.7 million in 2016-17, less than the $7.3 million he earned in 2015-16. Sikka got $3.7 million of the promised $8 million performance related pay, despite a clause in his employment contract allowing him to end his contract if his total compensation of $11 million  fell more than 10%.",2017-04-13,hI2j9yckPHHX6PkEuKU2PK,"Infosys March quarter results show a 0.7% sequential rise in dollar revenue to $2.57 billion, allowing it to end FY17 with a 7.4% y-o-y growth and $10.21 billion in revenue",competitor,09:42,Infosys Q4 results disappoint as growth sputters

Subsequently, the two were merged to create an entity called Air India.Air India, which has the largest fleet of 140 planes in the country, including brand new Boeing Dreamliner planes, flies to 41 international cities and 72 domestic destinations.

-0.01,"Bengaluru: Tata Group chairman Cyrus Mistry has a new worry in the growing pile of troubles afflicting Indias largest conglomerate. How to revive growth at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), which accounts for 16% of the groups $103.5 billion revenue?
				   
				The troubles at Tata Motors Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd are well-documented. Despite TCS reporting a 3.7% sequential dollar revenue growth in the April-June period, the company is likely to report weak numbers in the second quarter, results of which will be declared on 13 October.Worryingly for investors, TCS now risks growing at a slower clip this year than last year, when its revenue expanded 7.1%, the slowest annual growth at TCS since 2009, when Natarajan Chandrasekaran took charge as its chief executive. TCS is expected to report an at-best 1.6% sequential dollar growth in the second quarter, according to brokerage BNP Paribas. This, on the back of 3.7% growth in the first quarter, translates into TCS doing $8.79 billion business in the first six months of the current financial year. TCS now needs more than $8.92 billion in revenue in second half of the year if it intends to grow at 7.1% this year. Simply put, TCS will need to record a better show in the October-March period this year than in the second half of last year. This certainly is a tall task as technology outsourcing firms report soft growth in the second half of the financial year.Undoubtedly, Chandrasekaran faces a tough task given the size of TCS.At the heart of TCSs slow growth is its inability to build a stronger consulting practice and reluctance to buy small firms for technologies like design consulting and automation platform providers. These tiny buyouts not just improve the current solution deliveries but also bring in growth. May be now, Mistry could nudge Chandrasekaran to start buying.With this as a backdrop, Mint puts the spotlight on five things to watch in TCSs second quarter earnings on 13 October:1. Revenue growthBrokerage BNP Paribas expects TCSs dollar revenue to rise 1.6% to $4.43 billion in the July-September period on a sequential basis. This is a big worry as this will mean that TCS needs to put forward its best foot forward in the remaining six months of the year if it wants to save itself from the humiliation of recording an even slower growth than last year. Management commentary on demand levels from its customers in Europe, after Britain voted to leave the EU, will be crucial.2. Pressure on profitability poses a double whammySince January this year, TCSs operating margins have been under pressure. TCSs 26.1% Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin at the end of March quarter was 54 basis points less than margins at the end of October-December period last year. The companys margins further contracted to 25.1% at the end of March quarter, which the management claimed to be largely on account of annual wage hikes. Now, as commoditized deals come under further pricing pressure, and TCS continues to spend money in reskilling its workforce and building digital technologies, traditional levers like going slow on hiring, will not be enough to offset the gradual decline in profitability. Analysts say that TCS is unlikely to end the current financial year with its stated guidance of 26-28%.3. What really is the problem among TCSs BFSI clients in the US?On 7 September, TCS in a mid-quarter update, said that some holding back of discretionary spending particularly in the BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance clients) vertical in the United States had led to sequential loss of momentum at the company. Is this just an one-off development or does this suggest a structural malaise? We know all IT vendors are seeing less business from big banks as these banks are spending less in application development work. Homegrown technology vendors are further seeing erosion in current revenue from the embrace of automation platforms, which is cannibalizing the existing model of billing clients on human hours. 4. Rain check of weak sectors and geographiesTCS does not expect growth to rebound in Japan. The company claims to have arrested any loss of business from its UK-based insurance platform Diligenta. Growth from telecoms segment continue to be wobbly. Together, an underperformance from the three units eroded about 2% growth from the companys 11.9% growth on constant currency basis in 2015-16. TCS needs to report some growth on a consistent basis if it has to better last years growth.5. Is higher net erosion of existing business biting into TCSs growth?During the July-September period last year, TCS claimed its order book was the strongest ever, with about 30% more than the company ever managed in any quarter. The company, however, does not disclose its order book size. Outsourcing deals are long-term contracts, and IT vendors can generate only about 3-4% of revenue from new orders in the first year, according to JPMorgan Chases George. Agreed, IT firms lose about 3-5% of current business every year, which in TCSs case, translates into a loss of about $500-825 million a year. This clearly suggest that TCS is losing more business from existing clients because even some business generated from its record order book has not offset the annual loss of business, thereby resulting in a sluggish y-o-y growth.",2016-10-12,hesaBaeP0eIEHrwSnqJO5K,TC is likely to report weak numbers in the second quarter and risks growing at a slower clip this year than last year,company,01:16,TCS Q2 earnings: Five things to watch for today
-0.44,"Bengaluru: For Vishal Sikka, 2016-17 stands as a rebuke.
				   
				After three consecutive downward growth revisions, Infosyss dollar revenue growth in the year ended 31 March 2017 will be at best 7.6%, 150 basis points (bps) lower than the 9.1% growth in 2015-16, and 620 bps short of its first projected 13.8% growth outlined in April last year. One bps is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Departure of four executive vice-presidents (EVP) in financial year 2017 (in addition to four EVP exits between August 2014 and March 2016) implies that Sikka continues to struggle to build a stable top leadership team. Further, Infosys continues to look away from acquisitions (its been 18 months since the company made its last acquisition), which makes one wonder what Houdini trick the management has to achieve its target of becoming a $20 billion firm by March 2021.Also read: Will corporate earnings disappoint once again?Finally, Infosys founder N.R.Narayana Murthys outburst, twice in public, against some of the decisions by the board is another painful blow to Sikka. Agreed, Murthy has not questioned Sikka directly. But few of these decisions, including agreeing to a generous severance money to its former CFO (chief financial officer), and giving a hike to the current COO (chief operating officer), were approved by the management, and so it is naive to conclude that all is okay between Sikka and Murthy.Understandably, these developments have unnerved shareholders: in full fiscal year 2017, Infosys shares declined 16.2%, more than the 9% fall by BSE IT index, even as the benchmark Sensex index returned 17% gains. For these reasons, business historians would take note of the fall in Sikkas popularity: from being hailed as a hero in the first 18 months, Sikka now battles allegations of skulduggery and corporate greed.So what can Sikkaand Infosysdo to possibly break this impasse?First, get back growth and improve its execution. A related second measure is to get some growth from three divisions: Infosys BPO, EdgeVerve, the products and platforms unit (together bring about 13% of revenue), and Infosys Consulting. Infosys needs to improve its ability to sell more solutions from these three services to its clients. Lastly, Sikka needs to arrest senior management departures and build a stable leadership team. All this needs to be done swiftly, and once completed, hopefully, any corporate governance concerns of shareholders (including the founders) should be assuaged. It is important to note here that the displeasure expressed by some of the founders against the board only coincided with the period when Infosyss growth started slipping (during the first quarter of last year).Significantly, Sikkas $8 million performance-related pay as part of his $11 million compensation is a thorny issue, and how the board justifies this variable salary to its CEO on Thursday will dictate if there is a third instance of public spat between Murthy and the board. Is all this doable? Unlikely.Simply, because for IT services firms, chasing reclusive growth is more challenging than ever. Moreover, in case of Infosys, nothing short of a miracle can bring back peace between some of the founders and the board and management. With this as a backdrop, Mint puts the spotlight on five things to watch in Infosyss fourth quarter earnings on Thursday:Revenue forecast: Brokerage firm BNP Paribas sees Infosys recording 1.3% sequential increase in revenue at $2.58 billion for the January-March period. The Infosys management will be mindful that this growth will be 30 basis points less than what the company did in January-March last year. Analysts term the growth in the fourth quarter as exit rate and a strong growth helps to start on a good note in the new financial year. Again, management commentary for the April-June period will be crucial.Will Infosys give full-year guidance? For Infosys, providing a growth outlook is one decision which appears to be going down the wire. Analysts believe the management will give a growth outlook. Based on conversations with executives familiar with the development, this paper thinks otherwise and Infosys may discontinue from this practice. The board will eventually take a call when it meets on 12 and 13 April but this decision will decide the road ahead for the Infosys stock. Performance of top customers: During the second and third quarters, Infosyss largest client and top five and top 10 clients gave less business to the company. Until the June quarter of last year, Sikka did well to get more business from its largest clients. Since Infosys gets a fifth of total revenue from its top 10 clients, the management needs to reverse this decline if Infosys expects to record sustainable growth. A rain-check on Infosyss new initiatives in the wake of President Trumps strict visa laws: Over the last 33 months, Sikka has steered Infosys to embrace newer ways to do business, such as by bringing elements of user-centric method of Design Thinking. At the same time, Infosys has increased its focus on building platforms, in an effort to move away from people-led model of doing business. All these measures will be tested as US President Donald Trump works to have a strict policy in place which makes it arduous for outsourcing companies to bring engineers in the US. Hence, commentary on how Infosys is monetising its platforms business and impact of changes in visa will be eyed.Weak areas: Sikka has been unable to get respectable growth from EdgeVerve and Infosys BPO in his near three-year stint at Infosys. Another disappointment has been that the consulting division too ran into trouble in April last year. Infosys has put in a new leadership team at all three units over the last year, and management commentary on how soon it expects growth from these three units should decide the overall growth for the company.",2017-04-11,hf7FZlpmE3d9HBryi7Jd1L,"Infosys founders spat, Donald Trumps US visa policy and three consecutive downward growth revisions are likely to weigh in on the Q4 results to be declared today",competitor,08:58,Infosys results today: Five things to watch out for
-0.74,"New Delhi: The practice of forcing industries to cross-subsidize household consumers power tariffs is leading to an unprecedented shift among businesses towards captive solar power with some committing to go fully reliant on clean energy.
				   
				Cost of producing solar power, which was over Rs12 per kilowatt hour (unit) in 2010, has dropped sharply over the years. The latest auction, which was held in November, saw takers for solar power projects willing to sell power at Rs3 a unit. The fall in solar power generation cost has now made it attractive for businesses to go for captive solar power plants, including rooftop plants that supply power cheaper than from the grid, which is expensive on account of the cross-subsidy that industrial consumers are saddled with. Businesses, especially in the manufacturing sector, have long been complaining of high cost of power, exorbitant tax on diesel and escalating cost of capital as factors that render them less competitive in global markets where their peers enjoy low or negative cost of capital and in some cases, subsidies. Solar power is now available at Rs 4-4.5 a unit. In the future, it will cost much less because of technology improvement and possibly low cost of capital. In West Bengal, for instance, cost of power from the grid for industries ranges from Rs 6-8 per unit at present. In Maharashtra, it is Rs 6.5 a unit. Everywhere, except two or three states, tariffs are above Rs 5 a unit for industrial consumers. If you are able to get concessional finance from any multilateral agency and you can produce solar power at Rs 4 a unit consistently for 25 years, it can reduce cost of energy for the business and reduce carbon emissions, said Mahendra Singhi, chief executive officer, Dalmia Cements (Bharat) Ltd. Dalmia Cementss short term goal is to raise the share of clean energy in its total electricity consumption fourfold from 7% at present and to go fully reliant on clean energy in the long term. Multilateral agencies such as International Finance Corp. (IFC), the private investment arm of World Bank Group, US Exim Bank, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Japan International Cooperation Agency and Germanys KFW are bullish on Indias rapidly expanding renewable energy industry for investment opportunities. We already have $1 billion of investments in clean energy projects in India. We are open to scaling it up to $3-4 billion in coming years, said Shalabh Tandon, India lead, climate business & clean energy, IFC. IFC on Thursday announced an equity investment of $125 million in Hero Future Energies Private Ltd., a clean energy firm, for a minority stake. Tandon said that IFC does not invest in coal-based thermal power because of its commitment to climate change goals. Companies like Apple Inc., IKEA Group, Nokia Oyj, Infosys Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd are among those committed to becoming fully reliant on clean energy.The Economic Survey 2015-16 had suggested that the burden of subsidising poor consumers can shift from industrial consumers to rich individuals and that state electricity regulators should use income as a yardstick to fix the power tariff for individual consumers. The idea was to help businesses become more competitive. India has a target of putting in place 175 gigawatt (GW) of renewable power capacity by 2022, out of which 100 GW is to come from solar. At the moment, the country has about 8.7 GW of solar power capacity.One hurdle that companies face in going fully reliant on clean energy is that storage of energy is a costly proposition, which makes them rely on stable power from the grid for a significant part of their energy consumption when renewable energy is not available. Singhi of Dalmia Cements said that once power storage becomes a viable option, the company will be fully run on clean energy.",2017-01-06,hjuezPVDJdbEbipsCKavSN,The fall in solar power generation cost has now made it attractive for businesses to go for captive solar power plants,competitor,14:37,Cross-subsidy of power tariffs lure businesses to solar energy

0.05,"Bengaluru: It has been a little over 15 months since R. Seshasayee became the non-executive chairman of Infosys Ltd. His term coincides with a very interesting time for the company, which is trying to regain its tag as the bellwether of the Indian IT industry under its first non-founder chief executive, Vishal Sikka.
				   
				In an interview, Seshasayee explained his equation with Sikka, the changing role of the board, the challenges it faces, its relationship with the company founders, what he likes about Sikkas leadership style and why it is wrong to say that Infosys has twin power structures. Edited excerpts:Is Infosys in a better shape now than when you started in this role?Firstly, the change at the leadership level, to have someone like Vishal (Sikka) come (in), has (given) a very clear strategic direction to the company, given the changing landscape in the industry. That is a very big step forward.From the boards perspective, it is very important to have the right leader, and I believe we have the right leader. From the boards perspective, it is important that the leader articulates the strategy (and) the board is aligned to this strategy. I can categorically say that the board is fully aligned to this strategy Vishal has sketched.I and the board feel extremely good that this strategic change in direction to meet the new demands in the business landscape has gone down very well. To communicate this kind of a change in an organization that is as large as Infosys is not easy.Now, of course we have the execution challenges. And those are things which we will learn as we go along. We have had a few bumps. We have had some quick learning. I think, by and large, the strategy is getting executed with the right speed and in the right direction. What is the boards role in designing this strategy?Ideally, the board should pick the right leader for the company and the leader should articulate the strategy. The board has an active role to play for sure in understanding the strategic proposal, challenging that, and getting an alignment between the management and the board. The board cannot stand aside and say that all this is strategic direction and not our problem. The board has to be fully engaged in (the) formulation of strategy.We have had in the last couple of years a pretty deep level of engagement. The board does not meet only for board meetings for approving what is put on the table. So the engagement has been continuous. It has not been even that it takes place (just) once a quarter.The second is that I also think that it is important to think for the board to be learning. Learning is an important DNA of Infosys. Learning does not just apply to executives, the rank and file of management. It equally applies to members of the board. We have had systematic immersion sessions. And our intent is to intensify these sessions. Intent is to make sure that we are not merely sitting and listening in these sessions.This is a journey. It is never-ending. But I do think both these continuous engagement and continuous learning are making it possible to have a very constructive dialogue with the leadership. What are the big challenges faced by the board?I cannot think of a company of this size which has gone through transformation simultaneously on three fronts. The first is the business transformation. All IT firms are going through this, simply because (their) clients are going through this transformation. That is one massive transformation. That is pervasive and happening all across.The second is the move from (being) an iconic promoter-led organization to an organization that is professionally managed at the management and board level. I was actually looking at how many top 100 companies in India have entirely professional board and professional management. If you leave aside the banks and the public sector undertakings, perhaps Infosys is the only company. From a governance construct, this is a very unique and desirable construct, one which would be the ideal construct. But this transformation from a promoter-managed organization to a professional-managed organization both happening at the same time, is a huge transformation. Actually the average tenure of the board, if I leave aside Jeff (Professor Jeffrey Lehman), is two-and-a-half years. So you have a completely new set of people.And so, to be able to navigate this huge company in the right direction, from the point of view of both strategic (issues) and governance, that requires a great deal of work, and a great deal of rescripting of the playbook.We have had challenges in the first quarter. We have had some challenges (with) a couple of good leaders, whom we would have liked to retain, not being there. We have had some challenges regarding the perception issue into governance. I dont think these are real issues but perception issues. But we have very quickly learnt and we are putting in very quickly in place the right kind of solutions. That is the second kind of transformation which we are scripting very well.And then there is the third kind of transformation which is the cultural transformation. From a company that had been pretty much India-centric, we are truly now global-minded. This is a cultural shift. So, in some sense, we need to reset the needle. Each of these transformations is itself a challenge. It may not be apparent to someone on the outside. There is some criticism that Infosyss board does not have enough people with a technology background. Im hearing this for the first time that we do not have enough people from tech background on the board. We have Vishal and (chief operating officer) Pravin (Rao).Beyond Vishal and Pravin?Let me explain the diversity we have on the board. We have Ravi (Venkatesan), who has spent years in technology at Microsoft. Of course, we have Roopa (Kudva) and Punita (Kumar-Sinha). Look at their background. They have not been only in one industry. Roopa has spent a lifetime at a variety of industries, evaluating, assessing, rating a variety of industries. And so has Punita. We have people dealing with different firms, including technology firms. Then we have people like Jeff and John (Etchemendy) who bring the academic discipline to it. Kiran (Mazumdar-Shaw) is a very entrepreneurial person. We have a very good diverse group of people. Having said that, we are constantly on the lookout for the right kind of talent. We are pretty much looking at every possible skill where we think we have a gap and which we think we need to bring in. So we are looking at people. So that is a continuous process. We have people on the board who can read the future, have good understanding of technology trends, are able to challenge the strategic direction. We do take external inputs where we need. So those people dont have to be on the board.So could you perhaps expand the board?We are on the lookout, and we have some candidates in mind and we will do it at the right time.Help us understand the boards relationship with the company founders.So this iconic institution has been created by an iconic leader (N.R. Narayana) Murthy and his wonderful team. This is an outstanding or exceptional kind of history where Murthy and team decided to step down or step away. I must tell you categorically that while I have personally a lot of communication happening with Murthy, not once even by accident have the promoters asked for information which is not available to the public. That must be said to the credit of the promoters that they have not sought any information which would give them any preferential access to any information.We talk about many things. We talk about perceptions that you might have from what is available in the public domain, about the kind of strategic direction. And I take his advice very seriously. But that said, the board has the responsibility to do what is right for the institution. The board is closest to the facts and the situation on the ground.And therefore, information and facts, which are available to the board must drive the board in the right direction, and that decision will be of the board only. Do you think the founders could have expressed their unhappiness with certain board decisions such as Sikkas compensation or Kumar-Sinhas appointment differently?This is a question that should not be asked to me, since this is what the promoters chose to do; so it will not be fair for me to respond. From the boards perspective, we have advice coming from many other investors and not just the promoters. If you believe we do not have discussions with any other investors, you are wrong. The conversations we have with the promoters are no different than those we have with other investors. So it is not right for me to be second-guessing on what they should do. Were you a little saddened by the way they expressed their displeasure?This is a free world and everybody has their own viewpoint. So, do I get saddened by the percentage of negative votes on anything? No. I have a job to do, and we have some 99 percentage in favour and that is a resounding endorsement of the boards recommendation. We should just move on. What issues do you seek their advice on? There are many issues on which I seek advice from many people. So why would you want to only look at what Im seeking from Mr Murthy. Murthy has been a friend for 30 years. We have worked together on boards. We were together on the board of ICICI, we have worked together on many other forums. So he is one person I respect, like other people. So I dont see anything unusual in that. There is this perception that there are twin power centres at Infosys: Murthy and Sikka.First, there is no such twin power centres. That is completely wrong, and that will be very unfair to the promoters. Because, like I mentioned, Murthy has been an exceptional leader who has chosen to stay away and only give advice when sought from. So it will be utterly wrong. Now, the second thing is that when you say there is this perception. Now I dont want to deal with perceptions. We must deal with reality. Im dealing with reality. The reality is that what I have clearly said.What are the issues on which Sikka seeks your advice?Because of the fact that we have a very unique construct, the engagement of the board (with Sikka) has been continuous. My engagement with Vishal has been more intense than the rest of the board. I think we speak almost every week, sometimes multiple times a week. We discuss different issues, say related to people, organization, performance, relating to issues on strategy, customers. We discuss also spirituality and philosophy on weekends. We have an excellent rapport and relationship. We have a lot of common interests. Last night, we were talking on pure sciences. So, the foundation of the relationship is one of complete mutual trust, and complete transparent sharing of information and views. So there are many things that we do.How is the board helping Sikka in this transformation? Its a two-way constructive process. Its not on the basis of a paper that is put on the table. The way it is being done is through continuous, comprehensive and concerted engagement.What is the toughest issue you have advised him on so far?The toughest discussions we have had are on philosophy.Is Vishals compensation of $11 million a year linked to Infosys clocking $20 billion by March 2021?The compensation is linked to targets which are publically given. There is a trajectory for this. The compensation is linked to that trajectory. This is something which the board and Vishal have discussed and agreed.Can you help us understand the weightage of the three specific targets (total revenue, revenue per employee, operating margin) on Sikkas variable pay?There is probably no other Indian company which has so clearly linked pay to targets which have been made public. To my mind, this is the most transparent way of getting shareholders approval. In the trajectory, we have to take into account many things. We need to take into account the industry dynamics, the company dynamics, the people dynamics, all of that. Thats something which the board is charged with the responsibility to do and we will do so.Can you give us some details about the trajectory itself?Can you tell me another company that has been giving the targets for the compensation of the chief executive? There is good reason why no other company does this. It is not because this is inconvenient or anything. It is because, as I said, its a very dynamic situation. Every month, we see changes in the landscape. Every month, we see new challenges. The board is a delegated authority of the shareholders to run this company. It is therefore in the fitness of things that the board does the job that has been entrusted by the shareholders. It doesnt kick back to the shareholders the job that has been entrusted. We have gone one step further to say, yes this long-term goal is what we believe must be the reference point for the compensation.So is it more aspirational in nature?No, I have said that there is nothing aspirational in this. This is a target which the company is looking at, is pursuing. Now nothing is cast in stone. But this is, at the moment, the target that we have.Are you saying that the growth of the industry will also be taken into account?The growth of the industry is pretty much the playfield, right? So we have got to look at the growth of the industry in the context of assessment.(For any company,) the target is fixed for the annual budget in the context of what you see is the market situation. Technology changes, all of it are taken into account. A five-year goal is fixed on what you believe is the kind of the trajectory in this. We have to keep constantly calibrating both the environment and the industry. As of now, we are not changing those targets (for Infosys).Can they be changed?Thats a speculative question. Why did the board change its original plan on the promised payment to former chief financial officer Rajiv Bansal?All I can say is I have already made the statement suo motu in the AGM (annual general meeting). You wrote this article (referring to Mints story in May on Bansals unusually high severance pay). Because you wrote this article, I thought it is important and it is our responsibility to make sure that we address this issue. So the issue was not raised in the AGM, but I made a suo motu statement saying that we believe that there is no impropriety.There is a severance agreement. There are rights of the parties in the contract. And the contract will be administrated in line with the rights of the parties. Period. That is all. So has there been any change in the agreement?That is not something you need to be looking at all. I am only saying there is a contract, (there are) the rights of the parties in the contract and the contract will be administered in line with the contractual rights of the parties. Period.So is it fair to assume that you could rework it if one of the parties did not abide by its terms?This is an entirely legal issue. All I need to say is that there are no other extraneous considerations for this, for the administration of this. It will be driven by the contractual rights. Has anything happened within the realms of that contract that could lead to a change in it?No matter where you are coming from, the only two things which are relevant to the public and relevant to everybody else (are): Is this an issue where there is impropriety? I have said no, repeatedly no, and I stand by that.Is this contract getting changed or cancelled for any other extraneous considerations? I am going a step further to say: The contract will be administered based on the rights of the parties in the contract. Period.How do you like Sikkas leadership style?We have the right kind of leader in Vishal. His understanding of the changes, his insight into the changes is outstanding. Vishals articulation of a solution, even in the context of the auto industry for example or the banking industry, is absolutely on the dot. We have a very good leader who understands client requirements and his client connect is exceptional. His strategic direction is exceptional. He has been a phenomenal person to motivate a very, very large crowd. Its not easy for a new person to step in and have this kind of influence. We certainly have an exceptional leader.How has the boards role at a company changed?The role of a board has changed phenomenally, and for the good. It is no longer this friends club that you had in the past and people coming to have a cup of coffee and go back. This is the trusteeship concept. That is getting to be far better understood now by enlightened boards, and therefore, the responsibility that comes with that. In the process, the engagement is getting to be much more. Increasingly, I find that the board meeting is just one punctuation mark in that engagement. It also brings in the need for a greater amount of understanding of the business and the independence to challenge.

His regular ENT (ear, nose and throat) specialist had gone abroad for a medical conference and he didnt know of any other in his neighbourhood. He surfed the web for help and discovered, to his momentary relief, that he could fix an appointment online with a specialist at one of the hospitals not far from where he lived.
				   
				Hospitals, especially in India, have for long cut a sorry figure in terms of their digital savvy and use of information technology (IT) to be on par with their counterparts in sectors such as banking and telecom.According to Tirupathi Karthik, CEO of Napier Healthcare, a Singapore-based provider of software solutions to the healthcare industry, As compared to a global average of 22.5% of income spent on IT by healthcare providers, or even 6-15% being invested in IT in other sectors within India, anecdotal data from multiple sources indicate that healthcare providers in India rarely spend more than 0.5% of their annual revenue on information technology.  But things have been changing for some time, albeit at a pace slower than many would want. Leading the change are large hospital chains such as Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd, Max Healthcare Institute Ltd and Fortis Healthcare Ltd.Prodded on by the need to take control of their sprawling operationswhich span dozens of hospitals in multiple citieson the one hand, and the rising expectations of tech-empowered consumers on the other, these modern hospitals are setting the template for healthcare in India.High time they did so. If you looked at the hospitals in India around 10 years back, they were very basic in terms of tech infrastructure. Besides, independent doctors got what they pretty much wanted. This led to lack of control with the management and poor visibility into the entire treatment and costs hospitals had to bear, says Varun Gera, founder and chief executive of HealthAssure Pvt. Ltd, a primary  healthcare aggregator that has partnered with almost 2,300 clinics, including diagnostic labs and hospital OPDs (out-patient departments). He says that somewhere along the line hospitals had to work as hospitals and it could no longer be the case of doctors having their own way of doing things. While part of this doctors-management clash had to do with egos, a more significant role was played by ITthe lack of it in the early days and increasing enablement as time went on. It is the clinical protocols, organisation-wide processes and use of IT tools through which hospitals, particularly those with a corporate road map to grow fast, could gain better control, get visibility into how treatment is given, and embrace more standardization for better healthcare outcomes across their chain of facilities.Once processes and IT tools began to be adopted, hospitals moved on from using basic networking and hospital information systems (HIS) to looking at electronic medical records (EMRs) and other advanced deployments for improving efficiency as well as patient care.According to research firm Gartner Inc., Indian healthcare providers are set to spend $1.2 billion on IT products and services in 2016, including telecom services.  Among the key areas in which hospitals are increasingly focusing their IT efforts are online doctor appointments, data capture of patients visiting the hospitals and applying analytics tools to get insights into their operations.One of the large hospital chains investing big time in IT is Apollo. One of the things we have done is enabled online appointment for doctors. Earlier, less than 10% of our patients came by appointment. Now at Apollo almost 50% of patients are coming by appointment, says Sangita Reddy, joint managing director, Apollo Hospitals.That is a huge change in terms of avoiding the chaos resulting from a lot of patients just landing up at its hospitals all over India. It also allows Apollo to focus on the more important task of clinical care rather than manage hordes of patients shuffling from one department to the other on its premises.More significant change is afoot through the use of data analytics for both clinical and non-clinical insights. We are collecting about 55% of all our patients clinical data electronically, which is enabling us to create a digital warehouse. This digital warehouse, in turn, is enabling us to do data mining and use this data in different ways, says Reddy.These efforts are helping Apollo in workflow prediction, staffing, communication, etc., and helping the organization turn into a data-driven enterprise.One of the key areas in which analytics is being applied at Apollo, according to Reddy, is the use of predictive analytics for clinical purposes. We have pioneered the concept of personalized health check-ups in India: instead of a common check-up, it is customized based on analytics of data of almost 1 million patients that have visited our hospitals over the years, she says. The decision tree for providing healthcare is being evolved based on scenario building through matching a particular medicine with a particular disease or condition that previous patients had encountered. The result is quicker treatment with improved outcomes.The analytics tool enhances the effectiveness of the medication that doctors choose, says Reddy.On the question of the acceptance of such tools by the medical fraternity, she says, We use these predictive analytics tools in a recommendatory manner, so its not forced on the doctorsand we have found a very high degree of acceptance. Currently being used in its large hospitals, Apollo will soon extend its use to other hospitals as well.There is a lot of scope for improvement in the way hospitals in India operate and use IT to manage operations and deliver healthcare in a seamless manner taking into account the intricacies involved in settling health insurance claims. According to Gera, The whole focus now is on getting the data out and efficiency of operations. The way hospitals operate currently is much fractured, as there are multiple complexities involved in their operations.And while technology cannot do everything for hospitals, the right tools and processes can make a big difference to the quality and speed of healthcare delivery in India.Among the tools for improving or aiding clinical outcomes, International Business Machines Corp.s Watson cognitive computing solutions for healthcare are being considered by many hospitals in India. One of the first to implement it is Manipal Hospital Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. According to IBM, Watson for Oncology is now in use by oncologists at six locations in the Manipal Hospitals network to provide information and insights to physicians to help them identify personalised, evidence-based cancer care options across India.If the past decade signified the modernisation of hospitals in terms of physical infrastructure, medical equipment and the like, the next one is likely to be defined by integration of multiple IT tools, advanced analytics solutions, health monitoring devices and Internet of Thingsunder which medical devices, computer systems, smartphones and diagnostic equipment will share data with each other in real time for individualised, improved healthcare.",2016-11-04,iX1AMyGsjOevaUwtoZVn4N,"Hospitals have for long cut a sorry figure in terms of digital savvy and the use of information technology.

0.4,"Tata Sons Ltds failure to communicate with stakeholders to explain the trust deficit that it said had prompted Cyrus Mistrys ouster last month has reinforced a perception of opacity around the exit, proxy advisory firms and investors said on Tuesday.
				   
				In a research note released on Tuesday, Institutional Investor Advisory Service (IiAS) said independent directors of listed Tata group companies must provide comprehensive guidance to shareholders on whether Mistry should remain chairman of these firms.And, if boards of the listed companies are divided in their support of Mistry, there is a risk of the boards becoming dysfunctional, IiAS warned.On 27 October, three days after deciding to replace Mistry, Tata Sons released a statement in which it said: The Directors of the Tata Sons board had repeatedly raised queries and concerns on certain business issues, and Trustees of the Tata Trusts were increasingly getting concerned with the growing trust deficit with Mr. Mistry, but these were not being addressed. The Tata Sons board, in its collective wisdom, took the decision to replace its chairman in the manner undertaken.Tata Trusts are the single-largest shareholders in Tata Sons.The holding company has not elaborated on the trust deficit, and Tata Sons board is effectively asking investors to blindly trust it, IiAS said.In the research note, IiAS said it was important for Tata Sons to communicate to its companies boards the rationale to dethrone Cyrus Mistry. Tata Sons can begin by sharing the details of the board evaluation, and the process it followed to conclude that Mistry must be unseated, it said.With public perception veering towards Cyrus Mistry, the Tata group needs to provide factual and cohesive information supporting its decision to balance the discourse. Else it must back down, it added.A top official at a mutual fund company that is invested in various Tata group firms said: The process and the way it has been done is not to our liking, it could have been done in a much better way.On the day Tata Sons announced Mistrys removal, this official, who didnt want to be named, said he received two emails from Mistrys officeone an invitation to attend Tata Day, the global investor meet scheduled for 18 November, and the second to attend an event on 13 December to announce the formation of an investment trust that was to be formed between the Tata Group, BlackRock, McKinsey & Co and other firms to promote long-term investment in the Tata group companies.Both the events have now been rescheduled for next year.Independent directors of Indian Hotels Co. Ltd, which runs the Taj group, have backed Mistry, reposing their confidence in his leadership.State-owned Life Insurance Corp. of India (LIC), which has a significant stake in several Tata group firms, is also likely to back Mistry, said a person aware of the situation, who didnt want to be identified.If theres a resolution to vote for removal of Mistry, LIC may vote against it, he said.In response to questions on the IiAs note and how the company plans to justify the action taken a fortnight ago, a Tata group spokesperson said, These are subjective views of different profiles. Tata Sons on 24 October had said that the board in its collective wisdom and the recommendation of its principal shareholders decided that it may be appropriate in the long-term interest of the Tata Sons and Tata group to replace Mr Mistry. Independent directors have a right to a point of view, he said.The board of directors of Tata Chemicals Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd are set to meet on 10, 11 and 14 November, respectively, to discuss the companies September quarter earnings. It is not clear if the independent directors are  likely to meet ahead of  the quarterly earnings to discuss Mistrys board position.There will obviously be a resolution and it will be taken to a logical conclusion, whatever that may be, said a Tata group official, who declined to be identified.To pass a resolution supporting the removal of Cyrus Mistry as director with a 51% majority, the Tata group will need shareholders supportit only owns about 30-35% of equity in the listed companies of the group other than Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.Amit Tandon, founder and managing director at IiAs, said given the current complexity, going forward, the chain of command becomes very critical among the different entities within the Tata Groupthe Tata Trusts, Tata Sons and the operating companies.Ami Shah and Anirudh Laskar in Mumbai contributed to this story.",2016-11-09,iZlkEZyxqm4Yrh4907wN4J,"Tata group has to provide credible facts that necessitated former chairman Cyrus Mistrys ouster, say proxy advisory firms",company,01:21,Is trust deficit widening on Tatas narrative on Cyrus Mistry?
0.54,"Bangalore/Mumbai: Amid the carnage on Wall Street in 2008, as Bank of America Corp. was trying to forge its rushed merger with Merrill Lynch & Co., Natarajan Chandrasekaran boarded a plane for New York to try to reassure the two financial behemoths that an Indian IT company could make the systems of their strikingly different cultures work together.
				   
				Chandrasekaran, known as Chandra, was then chief operating officer of Asias largest IT services exporter, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS). Over the following weeks he fended off global rivals who smelled an opportunity to muscle in, and set about integrating the banks systems and assuaging the new managements anxieties about outsourcing to a foreign supplier. TCS kept the business and grew it substantially.Last week, Chandra, now chief executive officer of TCS, was chosen for an even more fraught diplomatic task: to resurrect the image and fortunes of the Tata Group, Indias biggest conglomerate, which has been racked by losses at some of its biggest units, and by a boardroom battle that has threatened to turn the workings of the venerable corporation into a media soap-opera.Tata Sons, the group holding company, named Chandra, 53, as chairman, taking over on 21 February from interim chairman Ratan Tata. Tata, 79, had run the family business for more than two decades before handing over in 2012 to his hand-picked successor, Cyrus Mistry. In October, Tata Sons shocked Indias corporate community by firing Mistry, reinstalling Ratan Tata and promising to find a replacement by March. Chandra was a front runner for the job, a Tata employee almost all his working life, who grew TCS into the conglomerates most successful business, with about $16 billion in sales.Yet he is both an insider and an outsider. While he has been with the group since joining as an intern three decades ago, he is the first chairman who is not a Parsi, the shrinking ethnic group of Zoroastrians that boasts a disproportionately high number of Indias business elite. He is only the third person without the Tata name to get the job, and the first without a close family tie to the Tatas.IT CareerMoreover, his career and success has all been with TCS, virtually an island within the group that serves many of the worlds top corporations with a young, skilled, technical workforce. As head of Tata Sons, he will be responsible for a conglomerate that assembles buses in Zambia, serves prawn kalimiri to diners at its Bombay Brasserie in London, sells salt to Indian families at Rs18(27 cents) a kilo, and runs hundreds of other businesses across the world.He served both TCS and the customer commendably during the BofA-ML merger. Now he has the chance to build a positive organization by bonding together various companies and their half-a-million plus employees, said S. Ramadorai, the previous CEO of TCS. He is non-confrontational and, at the same time, does not foolishly ignore problems.Chandras appointment came after TCS announced it had made the equivalent of $1 billion in quarterly profit for the first time. Tatas star unit accounts for over half of the groups market value.A five-man panel unanimously chose Chandra from a list of more than a dozen candidates. He stood out both within the group and outside, said former bureaucrat Vijay Singh, a non-executive director on the board of Tata Sons, which ratified the selection. A Tata Sons statement said Chandra would uphold the groups values and adhere to its high standard of practicesthings the board previously accused Mistry of failing to do.We are at an inflection point, said Chandra in a statement after his appointment. I am aware that this role comes with huge responsibilities. It will be my endeavor to help progress the group with the ethos, ethics and values that the Tata group has been built on. Chandra declined an interview request for this story.Steel lossesFacing him is a menu of corporate issues, including the money-losing UK operations of Tata Steel Ltd., the overhang from failed ambitions like Tata Motors Ltd.s cheap Nano car, debt-ridden Indian Hotels Co., and a $1.17 billion arbitration battle with telecom partner NTT Docomo Inc. Mistry has previously defended his time as chairman, when he tried to reduce debt built up during a series of global acquisitions by Ratan Tata. In an e-mail to directors after his dismissal, Mistry said the group may face Rs1.18 trillion in writedowns over time because of  legacy hotspots he inherited.Mistry, whose family owns an 18% stake in Tata Sons, filed a case with the National Company Law Tribunal seeking the appointment of an administrator to oversee the companys affairs, a forensic audit and a probe into the role of the trustees of Tata trusts, the majority shareholders of Tata Sons. Hes asked for Ratan Tata, head of the trusts, to be restrained from attending board meetings. A spokesman for Mistry said he would not comment as the matter is subject to the legal proceedings.Investors expect Chandra to act quickly to resolve governance issues, said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director at proxy advisory firm InGovern Research Services Pvt. Key to his success will be how he handles Ratan Tata, who has indicated that he may step down as chairman of the trusts this year. Tata instigated the Nano project, a troubled airline venture and many of the other expansions that are now draining the groups resources.Tata congratulated Chandra on Twitter, saying he was sure the new chairman would protect the groups values and ethics. A Tata Group spokesman declined to comment.Chandra is an optimist, he thinks big and will go after positive outcomes in the new job, said Krishnakumar N., executive chairman of rival Indian IT services company Mindtree Ltd.The son of a farmer in rural southern India, Chandra studied in a Tamil-language school rather than gaining the English-language education favored by the middle class.He joined TCS in 1987 after completing a masters in Computer Applications from Regional Engineering College, Trichy, Tamil Nadu. His leadership talent was spotted by Ramadorai in 1993 when Chandra was praised by customer International Business Machines Corp. He was put in charge of a major project for British Telecommunications Plc. When Ramadorai became TCSs CEO, he chose Chandra as his executive assistant.He loved meeting customers, and it was never a Hi-How-Are-You? kind of a meeting, Ramadorai said in a telephone interview. He put the client at the center of the universe, made every conversation count and nurtured clients like American Express.Young CEOChandra took over as chief executive of TCS in 2009 at the age of 46. Over the next seven years, he would triple the IT companys share price and revenue and more than double its headcount.As Chandras corporate universe expanded, so did his interests, according to colleagues. Hes fond of photography and classical music, but his real passion is running. He has run marathons in Boston, Chicago, Berlin, New York, Tokyo and other cities.Being a runner has greatly shaped my thinking as a leader, Chandra told Runners World in October 2015. You have to decide on the length of the engagement, develop endurance to handle setbacks and increase speed when the competition demands it. You have to perform with your heart and your mind.At TCS, Chandra backed new technologies from cloud to mobile and evangelized to global corporations about digital disruption, always with a reputation for building close relationships with clients. Som Mittal, former head of Hewlett-Packard Co.s India operations, worked with Chandra for years in the software-industry trade body Nasscom and said if he texted Chandra, hed get a call back within 20 minutes.Whether he was preparing for a marathon in London or stepping into a client meeting in New York, he unfailingly called back, no matter what timezone and which corner of the globe he was in, said Mittal. He was also an inveterate traveler who would fly to client meetings even for the smallest deals. He has this uncanny ability of making everyone think they are his dearest friends.Chandra drove projects at TCS that dispersed the chaotic crowds and touts that used to clog the entrances of Indias passport offices and its best-known hospital, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi. He charted new territories for TCS in Latin America and Japan by hiring local talent.His new role comes with a different set of challenges. He will have to stabilize the group and plan a decade or two into the groups future, said Ramadorai. It is a rough road.Looming over him will be the presence of a family that has been royalty in Indias business world for more than a century, and the scion of that family, Ratan Tata.Chandra is not afraid to express opinion and can be extremely firm when he is convinced about something, said Mittal. He is no pushover. Bloomberg",2017-01-16,icSPfNFcGFeEX4LWRyqbnM,Natarajan Chandrasekaran  will take over as chairman of Tata Sons from interim chief Ratan Tata on 21 February ,company,12:30,N.

0.27,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. lost $4.4 billion in market capitalization after it disclosed a corruption probe and the resignation of one of its senior-most executives. 
				   
				The company is conducting an internal investigation into whether certain payments relating to facilities in India were made improperly and in possible violation of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other applicable laws, it said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Cognizant also announced the resignation of Gordon Coburn, who was effectively the second-in-command at the company. The two announcements coming together was clearly too much for investors to handle. Cognizants shares fell as much as 13.3% on the back of fears that Coburns resignation could be because the scale of the improper payments was significant. According to an analyst, the uncertainty and the lack of clarity is making investors jittery. If government agencies find wrongdoing, there could be a fine in store. Besides, the company may lose business because of reputational issues. About a year ago, The Wall Street Journal had reported that the US government found Wal-Mart Stores Inc. paid bribes worth millions of dollars to local officials in India. The US agencies probing the company havent announced a fine or a settlement yet, but Wal-Mart has spent hundreds of millions of dollars so far investigating the possible payment of foreign bribes. The largest FCPA enforcement action, so far, was in the case of Siemens AG, which paid $350 million in disgorgement to settle SECs charges, and a $450 million fine to the US department of justice (DoJ) to settle criminal charges. In 2014, Alstom SA pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $772 million to end an investigation by DoJ. Of course, the eventual fine or settlement fees will depend on the quantum of improper payments, if any, made by Cognizant, and the extent to which it profited from these payments. Thanks to Coburns resignation, speculation about how severe the hit can be are running wild. Cognizant is already grappling with a slowdown in growth rates; it brought down its revenue growth guidance for 2016 in August, and now expects revenue growth to be in single digits. Since then, commentary by other IT services companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd suggests things have deteriorated. As such, the timing of the corruption probe couldnt be worse. Cognizant shares have fallen nearly 25% from end-March levels, owing to the twin impact of the business slowdown and legal uncertainty.",2016-10-02,ij1XS6Af5PzdHlaF6uAooN,"If government agencies find wrongdoing, there could be a fine in store; besides, the company may lose business because of reputational issues",competitor,23:51,Cognizant investors grapple with business and legal uncertainties

Discussions with Bain and TPG are currently only for a 26% stake in the company. On 5 January, Mint had reported on the talks between KKR and the Singh brothers for a majority stake in Fortis, alongside a structured equity deal in RHC Holding Pvt. Ltd (RHPL). RHPL is the holding firm for the Religare and Fortis brands.Singh brothers are also exploring debt financing options.In November, Mint reported that RHPL was in talks to refinance $300 million debt.

The arbitral award came after the Japanese company alleged that the Singh brothers had concealed crucial information while selling Ranbaxy to it for $4.6 billion in 2008.A Singapore tribunal has ordered the brothers to pay Rs2,562 crore, which they are contesting in the Delhi High Court.In March, the court directed Singh brothers to furnish, within a week, details of all of their unencumbered assets, in order to ensure the use of such assets to satisfy the arbitral award, at a later stage, if required, Mint reported on 7 March.",2017-04-09,ikUrvoEshkw3P1siSv5qTM,"Religare Enterprises Ltd sale of its 80% stake in Religare Health Insurance to True North and other investors values the firm at Rs1,300 crore",competitor,21:38,"Religare sells 80% stake in health insurance arm to True North, others"
0.03,"Bengaluru: Wipro Ltd reported third-quarter revenue that missed analysts estimates although it was in line with the managements forecast, and provided a weak outlook for the fourth quarter, mirroring the challenges faced by rivals in the countrys $150 billion outsourcing sector.
				   
				Wipro on Wednesday said its dollar revenue declined 0.7% sequentially to $1.9 billion (0.6% rise in constant currency terms), after it had earlier outlined quarterly growth of at-best 2% in constant currency terms in the third quarter. Net profit declined 1% to $309 million from $312 million in the preceding quarter.A Bloomberg survey of analysts had estimated revenue of $2.01 billion (Rs13,678.7 crore) and profit of $308.23 million (Rs2,094.6 crore).Wipro expects between 1% and 2% revenue growth in constant currency terms in the January-March quarter. Chief executive officer Abidali Neemuchwala said it would take at least three-four quarters for the steps he has taken to bear fruit.Operationally, it was a good quarter. Our profitability improved in a quarter where there are furloughs and fewer working days. But I think in revenue growth we could have done more, Neemuchwala said. He added that the companys core business is doing well and that in three-four quarters it would return to industry-leading growth. Wipros weak numbers come after a tepid show by its peers. Infosys Ltd reported a 1.4% sequential drop in dollar revenue in the third quarter and cut its full-year revenue outlook for the third time while industry leader Tata Consultancy Services Ltd posted a 0.3% dollar revenue growth. Infosys now expects dollar revenue growth of at-best 7.6% this year (8-9% in constant currency terms). Wipro provides only a quarterly revenue growth outlook. Hearteningly for Wipro, the company managed to improve its operating margins by 50 basis points to 18.3%. However, two of the biggest challenges ahead for Wipro are to improve its ability to generate more business from existing clients and reviving organic growth. Wipros share of business from its top clients continues to slide. Even though Wipro managed to improve its quarterly revenue by 6.3% year-on-year, the share of the largest, top five and top 10 clients declined by 21.9%, 16.5%, and 14%, respectively.During the quarter, Wipro spent $8.7 million to buy Infoserver SA, a Brazilian company that offers solutions to banks and insurance companies. This is the fifth acquisition by Wipro in the last 20 months; it spent $1.13 billion in buying the other four companies, including cloud-services firm Appirio Inc. for $500 million. Apart from Appirio, which has $200 million in revenue, the three companies together have over $350 million in revenue, which translates into a growth of at-least 4% from the buyouts. Considering Wipro is expected to grow at-best 5% in the current year, this means the companys traditional business is hardly growing. Until the company can start recording good organic revenue growth, any talk of a turnaround is premature, said an analyst at a domestic brokerage who asked not to be identified. Wipros digital revenue improved to $413 million, a 10% sequential increase. In the quarter to December, Wipros business grew 0.7% in the US, which brings more than 55% of the total business, but declined 2.3% in Europe, which accounts for 23.6% of revenue.",2017-01-25,jCiaZDw7r0KIIPcIOKKEcI,"Wipros IT services revenue in the third quarter grew 3.5% to $1.90 billion from a year ago period, but the firm provided a weak outlook for the fourth quarter",both,17:39,Wipro revenue forecast underlines IT industrys challenges
0.48,"Mumbai: Shareholders of Tata Motors Ltd voted on a resolution on Thursday to remove Nusli Wadia as a director at the companys extraordinary general meeting (EGM).
				   
				Though the voting results were not released at the time of going to press, the odds seemed to be  stacked against the industrialist who has been a director on the Tata Motors board for more than 18 years, if the number of shareholders who spoke in favour of the resolution seeking his removal was any indication. Tata Sons, the Tata group holding company, in November sought the removal of Wadia as director of Tata Steel, Tata Motors and Tata Chemicals. Tata Sons controls 26.51% of Tata Motors, 29.75% of Tata Steel and 19.35% of Tata Chemicals.ALSO READ | Nusli Wadia removed as Tata Steel directorEarlier this month, Wadia filed a Rs3,000 crore defamation suit against Ratan Tata and the board of Tata Sons.Global proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (ISS) questioned the rationale behind resolution to seek removal of Wadia, an independent director at three Tata companies. Proxy advisory firm Stakeholder Empowerment Services (SES) on the other hand, recommended shareholders of Tata Steel, Tata Motors and Tata Chemicals to vote in favour of a resolution to remove him. Both developments happened earlier this month.Sixty-three people spoke at the EGM; most spoke in favour of the resolution.Before the meeting, Wadia, who did not attend the EGM, had made his case to the companys shareholders in a letter. Wadia said he had chosen not to attend, calling the recent EGMs as inappropriately and shamefully stage-managed.Wadia, 72, was removed as an independent director from the board of Tata Steel Ltd late on Wednesday with a majority of both institutional and retail investors voting against him at an EGM. On Friday, he will face a similar test at an EGM called by Tata Chemicals Ltd to remove him.Wadias four-page letter to Tata Motors shareholders, dated 21 December, spoke of attempts by Tata Sons to influence independent directors and the board of Tata Motors through unsigned legal opinions. These opinions, he said, were circulated just hours before a company board meeting to influence, intimidate and muzzle the independent directors from communicating with the stock exchanges.He wrote about the companys ill-conceived investments in low-cost passenger car Nano and the delay in its closure leading to a serious drain on the finances of the company. Wadia said every sale of Nano was at a substantial loss to Tata Motors, with total losses on Nano running into thousands of crores.Wadia also wrote about cross-holdings in Tata companies, the largest of which, he said, was Tata Sons valued at Rs8,600 crore.Wadia said the cross-holdings were being held in Tata Motors, a debt-ridden company, to keep voting control over Tata Sons. The listed companies as a whole have blocked approximately Rs70,000 crore in holding Tata Sons shares equivalent to 14% of its capital with the sole purpose of shoring up the voting rights of the (Tata) Trust(s).It is for you the shareholders of Tata Motors who own 70% of the shares of your company to decide whether you want to be the holder of Tata Sons shares with minimum return, zero liquidity and no exit, he wrote.Wadia said it was the first time in Tata Motors history that a productivity-linked settlement was agreed, initiated and was to be signed with the union in Pune after 14 months of discussion, but Ratan Tata met the union and asked them to support the change in leadership. The union subsequently issued a statement that their relationship with the management of the company had taken a downward trend over the issues. This irresponsible action galvanizing and acting prejudicially against the interest of your company may jeopardise its future and impact the overall morale of all the workers and employees of Tata Motors. The letter also pointed to the impact on the passenger vehicle business due to issues in design, product, quality, execution and high costs being directed from the top. The division has high capital employed, high level of loss that impacts overall financials of the company, he wrote. What is at stake now is not whether I am removed or not, but the fate of the very institution of the independent director that has been created in law and by Sebi (capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India) to safeguard the interests of all stakeholders, the letter said.On Wednesday, Wadia had said that the ability of promoter Tata Sons to seek removal of independent directors from group company boards could force them to either toe the line, resign or face removal.",2016-12-22,jFgUgkZQ86jpARNXaZ6grJ,"A number of shareholders, at the Tata Motors EGM, spoke in favour of the resolution seeking Nusli Wadias removal was any indication",company,11:29,Odds stacked against Nusli Wadia at Tata Motors EGM

He will also have the support of Ratan Tata who is unlikely to give him the kind of free hand he gave Mistry.

				Kingfisher Airlines was grounded at the end of 2012. Lets take a look at how Air India and Kingfisher  stack up (over a three-year period till 2013). The details are in the accompanying table.The table shows Kingfishers loss after tax rose to Rs.4,300 crore for 2012-13 from Rs.1,027 crore in 2010-11. Sure, Air India shows a decline in loss during the same period. But its loss of about Rs.5,500 crore for 2012-13 was 27% higher than that of Kingfisher.Now consider the debt figures. As on 31 March 2013, Air Indias total debt (long-term borrowings plus short-term borrowings) was an enormous Rs.47,328 crore, while Kingfishers debt was Rs.8,658 crore. Air Indias deterioration in net worth is higher than Kingfishers in this period.According to its 2012-13 annual report, Kingfishers accumulated losses at the end of the year stood at Rs.16,024 crore. News reports peg Air Indias accumulated losses in the same period at over Rs.30,000 crore. Clearly, Air Indias financials were far worse than that of Kingfishers, and there has been little improvement so far.True, theres a difference between Kingfisher Airlines and Air India in the sense that nobody has alleged any fraud in the public sector airline. But the fact remains that the amount of public funds lost so far in Air India is higher than that lost on account of Kingfisher. True, it is conceivable that Air India may turn the corner, but it is also possible that it may continue to incur losses in future.How is the governments attitude to Air India any different from that of the bankers to Kingfisher who continued to support an enterprise whose net worth had been wiped out in the hope that it would turn around? Is it fair for private sector airlines if the government continues to throw good money after bad in Air India?

0.63,"Singapore: Monday evenings coup at Bombay House, the headquarters of Indias steel-to-software conglomerate Tata, was as swift as it was abrupt.
				   
				Not only did the board of Tata Sons, the holding company, dump Cyrus Mistry as chairman after less than four years, it also brought back Ratan Tata, 78, as the interim boss, leaving nobody in any doubt that the founding family of the 148-year-old empire was reasserting control.But what made Tata reach for the nuclear option?The companys brief statement gave no clues, though conspiracy theories range from Mistrys futile attempts at micro-managing a maddening potpourri of companies, to not having a nose for talent (a six-member executive council put together by him was also disbanded), and selling the family silver to pay down debt when he should have focused more on growth.Investors in Tatas suite of operating companies were picking up signs of discord, but were still unprepared for a coup. After all, Ratan Tata seemed to be nothing less than delighted when a selection committee tasked to find his successor returned from a 15-month global hunt with the idea that Mistry  a member of the search panel as well as the son of a large shareholder  was the best choice. If the 48-year-old executive is now being removed for being out of his depth, the more experienced Ratan Tata deserves some blame for putting him in that position in the first place.Also Read: Understanding the Tata Sons boardroom coupBesides, its not clear that Mistry was doing a lousy job. Start the clock in late August 2004, when the IPO of software business Tata Consultancy created the group as it exists today. In the subsequent eight years that Tata guided the behemoth, a market capitalization-weighted index of its 26 listed units barely managed to beat the Sensex. Over a shorter time frame, Mistry has outperformed the benchmark more convincingly.When it comes to future returns, though, Ratan Tata may have reasons to be anxious about the direction in which Mistry was steering the ship.Tata took advantage of a China-fueled boom in commodity demand to load up on debt, which led to an eightfold expansion in the annual net income of the groups publicly traded companies in the six years through 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But with overcapacity in the Peoples Republic hitting the groups steel business hard, profitability waned.In wanting to reduce leverage by selling everything from money-losing UK steel operations to coal mines in Indonesia and hotels in the US, Mistry has veered too far away from his predecessors expansionist strategy. With the pace of capital expenditure down to a 12-month run rate of $2 billion versus $3.7 billion in Tatas final year at the helm, the group runs the risk of courting irrelevance. Also Read: Cyrus Mistry ouster could slow Tata groups debt reduction processMore worrisome, from a Tata perspective, is that the group nowadays makes news mostly for the wrong reasons. Whether its an almost $1 billion jury award against its software unit for a US intellectual-property infringement case, or the embarrassment of losing a $1.17 arbitration brought against Tata Sons by NTT Docomo for alleged failure to honour a partnership contract, the conglomerates reputation for good corporate citizenship has taken a beating.Its hard to say if Mondays putsch will fix everything from strategic wobbles to PR snafus.

				According to filings by Infosys with stock exchanges, only 24% of promoter votes were cast in favour of the resolution seeking a 35% rise in Raos compensation to Rs12.5 crore. The remaining abstained. This mirrored the promoters voting 12 months ago on a resolution seeking a two-year extension and a revised compensation of $11 million for chief executive Vishal Sikka.  The latest show of promoter disenchantment, according to people familiar with the development, suggests that the truce reached between the founders and the companys board after an open confrontation in February may only have resulted in an uneasy and temporary calm.The resolution was one of three Infosys sought to pass through electronic voting or postal ballots by 31 March. The remaining two resolutionsan amendment to its articles of association allowing Infosys to consider a share buyback, and the appointment of D.N. Prahlad as independent directorreceived overwhelming approval from promoters and other shareholders. Infosys founder N.R. Narayana Murthy clarified that the decision of some of the founders not to vote in favour of the proposed salary increase for Rao was because of their belief in compassionate capitalism. This abstention has nothing to do with Pravin, Murthy said in an emailed response to a questionnaire from Mint. I have lots of affection for Pravin. Let me state you the facts. I believe in striving towards reducing differences in compensation and equity in a corporation. I have always felt that every senior management person of an Indian corporation has to show self-restraint in his or her compensation and perquisites. This is necessary if we have to make compassionate capitalism acceptable to a majority of Indians who are poor. Without compassionate capitalism, this country cannot create jobs and solve the problem of poverty. Further, giving nearly 60% to 70% increase in compensation for a top level person (even including performance-based variable pay) when the compensation for most of the employees in the company was increased by just 6% to 8% is, in my opinion, not proper.Finally, given the current poor governance standards at Infosys, let us also remember that these targets for variable pay may not be adhered to if the board wants to favour a top management person, said Murthy.

Five of the seven original co-founders, Murthy, Nandan Nilekani, S.D. Shibulal, Kris Gopalakrishnan and K. Dinesh are categorized as promoters of the company, and the founders together hold a 12.75% stake.

In April last year, Nilekani and Sudha Murty, Narayana Murthys wife and chairperson of the Infosys Foundation in India, approved Sikkas reappointment until 2021 and a higher salary, as other founders abstained. A similar voting result this time suggests that both Nilekani and Sudha Murty voted in favour of Rao, too. Gopalakrishnan declined to offer a comment while emails sent to Nilekani and other founders went unanswered.

				Pradhan said a three-pronged strategy had been adopted for digitizationrapid expansion of digital payment infrastructure at fuel stations, a campaign to spread awareness, and incentivizing consumers to opt for digital payments. The volume of daily cashless transactions has increased from Rs150 crore to Rs400 crore per day since the 8 November demonetization of high-value banknotes that created a cash crunch.So far, 38,128 retail outlets have been equipped with point-of-sale (PoS) machines. More than 86% of the outlets have infrastructure for digital payment transactions. Most of the petrol pumps have opted for digital infrastructure such as micro ATMs and e-wallets since demonetization. However, the cashless drive can be accelerated further with the adoption of BharatQR or a standardized quick response (QR) code across all the retail outlets, said Sunil Kulkarni, deputy managing director, Oxigen Services (India) Pvt. Ltd, a payment company.To incentivize cashless payments, Pradhan said that the government had on 8 December announced a discount of 0.75% for purchase of petrol/diesel through credit/debit cards and e-wallets, at fuel retail outlets run by OMCs. It came into effect from 13 December.The burden of the discount is being borne by state-owned OMCs Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL).The oil ministry tweeted later in the day that it is exploring options to deliver petroleum products to consumers at their doorsteps on pre-booking. This would help consumers avoid spending excessive time and long queues at fuel stations, said the tweet.

-1.0,"New York: IBM Corp. is teaming up with Slack Technologies Inc. to make it easier for companies to build custom chatbots into the start-ups workplace-messaging systems, the latest move by Big Blue to add more diverse business cases for its Watson artificial-intelligence technology.
				   
				The two companies will release a developer toolkit that includes Watson technologies and can integrate easily into Slack, they said in a statement Wednesday. International Business Machines Corp. will also build a chatbota conversation-based applicationthat will help IT departments identify and resolve issues without having to leave the Slack platform. The start-ups own customer-service bot will incorporate the Watson Conversation system, which includes technologies such as speech-to-text conversion and natural-language processing, or the ability for a computer to understand what a person is saying.Right now, if you say something to Slackbot in Slack, it will kind of blindly take what you ask it and do a search, Slack chief executive officer Stewart Butterfield said. The bot tries to match the query to a preset document and doesnt have any AI technologies helping it decode the meaning of the question. With Watsons technology, the system will better understand and learn about the way users ask about things and will collect better results, he said.Sending messages using applications such as Slack or Facebook Inc.s WhatsApp or Messenger has become an attractive communication method for both consumers and companies, leading to a boom in chatbots. Businesses are eager to interact with their customers on these platforms using bots, which can provide direct contact without requiring them to hire a bunch of customer-service representatives or salespeople to do the leg work.A virtual agent that can answer questions and synthesize large reams of data is useful because its a faster way to get people the right answer versus going through files and finding it themselves, said David Kenny, general manager at IBM Watson. It enables people to work with machines the way they work with each otherits a more natural way to work.Bot expertiseArmonk, New York-based IBM has come across a number of old and new clients that are creating these kinds of conversational bots, building them from various Watson technologiesputting them together like Lego blocks. To make it easier for companies to build chatbots, IBM has also combined the relevant blocks to create a new service, Watson Virtual Agent, according to a separate statement. Companies using this service can pick a specific focus for the bots expertise, such as retail, and can train it using internal proprietary data, Kenny said.The push in chatbots is IBMs latest move to add more artificial intelligence to software, an extension of its overall bet that companies will pay for AI products that can automate business processes. The suite of Watsons AI services is key to IBMs strategy to drive growth in software sales, especially as demand ebbs for older products.About 30,000 IBM employees use Slacks messaging system, making it one of the San Francisco start-ups biggest customers. The goal of the new partnership for both companies is to use AI to quickly provide insights from the huge data sets collected by the messaging system, yet require a lot of processing power to analyse. Each Slack customer, for example, has archived messages about everything from human-resources questions to sales data to network issues, all information that can be fed to an artificial intelligence machine that can be used to advise people on later inquiries and problemsvia, say, a chatbot interface. Both companies agree that theyre at the beginning stages of building new technology that can achieve that vision.Its hard to overestimate the degree of difficulty or depths we have to go to, Butterfield said. IBM has huge investments in this area and they have a great idea of the opportunities.",2016-10-26,kMXUqXsejAjHN5tUKKGM5H,IBM will build a chatbota conversation-based applicationthat will help IT departments identify and resolve issues without having to leave the Slack platform,competitor,16:51,IBM teams up with Slack to build smarter data-crunching chatbots

				Under a new executive order signed by US President Donald Trump, America is reviewing its visa programme for foreign workers, while ensuring a crackdown on visa abuse and frauds. The H1B visa programme is most sought-after by Indian IT firms and professionals to work on customer sites. Every year, the US grants 65,000 H1B visas, while another 20,000 are set aside for those with US advanced degrees. No new changes are being implemented immediately... Nothing is being proposed that would impact or change the FY18 H1B lottery that is currently underway, Nasscom said in a statement.

The Indian government, on its part, has said it will take up the issue with the American authorities during the upcoming visit of finance minister Arun Jaitley to the US. Another industry body Assocham also expressed concern over the tightening of the visa norms. ...Indian IT companies are bound to face disruptions by way of higher costs and even some laying off work force back home, as the rising rupee is aggravating the situation further for the technology export firms, it said.

It has also said it will tweak its business model to continue to be in compliance with regulations. With rising protectionism across markets like the US, Singapore and now Australia, companies are beginning to adjust their business models to reduce their dependence on visas, hiring more locals instead.

0.51,"Geneva: Carlos Ghosn, 62, is the global auto industrys most charismatic and, some would say, best performing chief executive officer (CEO). He is also the chairman and CEO of French auto maker Renault SA, chairman of Japans Nissan Motor Co. Ltd, and chairman of Mitsubishi Motors Corp. He has turned around the fortunes of the first, rescued the second from near oblivion, and now wants to do the same with the third. 
ALSO READ | India is a big market for any carmaker: Renault CEO Carlos GhosnOn 23 February, Nissan announced Ghosn would step down as CEO, and focus on managing the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance. On the sidelines of the Geneva Motor Show, Ghosn spoke to Autocar India on the alliance, his plans for Mitsubishi in India, and how he took inspiration from Tata Motors Ltds Nano. Edited excerpts: You have kind of relinquished your position as CEO in Nissan and are going to be focusing on the alliance specific to Mitsubishi. In India, Mitsubishis problem was no scale, no investment and no appropriate product. Suddenly these problems matter no more because of the alliance. Will it be logical to assume that with the alliance theres a big market out there for Mitsubishi to tap? Without any doubt because, in India, the most important step and our key for successnot sufficient but necessaryis the product.  If you dont have the product, you better not try your chance in India. It takes a lot of time to find a product. I think, with the A-platform (the second of the so-called common module family, or CMF, jointly developed by Renault and Nissan, a sort of modular manufacturing system for cars),  particularly with the Kwid and all the products that are going to follow that, we think we have found our entry level (car) in the Indian market. But this platform is an alliance platform. Today, you are having a Renault product, tomorrow you are going to have a Nissan product. This platform will be open to Mitsubishi. So Mitsubishi could use it and you could go all the way up and bring the Lancer back for example? Yes, but Mitsubishi has so many opportunities to grow that the management of Mitsubishi is going to have to prioritize what they are going to do first, second and third. So I cannot tell you in what time frame this will happen, but without any doubt, this is a very big market for (the) future for any carmaker and for Mitsubishi in particular.So what you are confirming is that its not a question of if but a question of when Mitsubishi will come to India with all guns blazing? We are not limited to the short term; it is going to obviously mean mid- or long-term. Everybody expects India to be in the top 3-4 markets in the future. So you can expect that what happened in China, where all the carmakers are present, is also going to happen in India, with (the) exception that the Indian market is very tough for the foreign carmaker because of the specificity of the product and market.Do you think you have an edge with Kwid? It is doing well and has already got a lot of things like design and the touch-screen and a lot of things.Yes, we do; and we are improving and we are listening to what the customers are saying in India. Not only to improve our offer for the Kwid in India but also to improve our offer for the Kwid outside India because you know a version of the Kwid is going to be launched in Brazil as a second step of the A platform. So, for the Indian market, this is very important because it is very competitive, and if you are going to make it in India, you are going to make it in many emerging markets, and thats why for us, testing and being successful in India and having a very strong acceptance of the product, a very competitive product in India, is a guarantee that these are going to do well in other markets.Are you making money in India? Is this the tipping point?We are starting to make money now after selling 100,000 Kwids. We struggled at the beginning because it was the new plant and a new car, so when you have so much innovation accommodated, you struggle with profitability. When you are going to a new emerging market with a new product, you have to be patient for your returns. In future, is the CMF-B (for cars slightly larger than those on the CMF-A platform) also expected?Obviously, the volume you expect from a car based on that platform is not going to be very big, so it can be an additional product but you cant have a strategy on this platform.So is there a lesson learnt by Nissan on the performance of its V platform (cars such as the Sunny and Micra that did not do well in India)? That you fundamentally cannot bring a European platform into India because the cost is too high and the customers may not pay for it? You can bring copy and paste platform and product but that has to be a niche product. Dont expect big volume coming out of it. If you want big volume in India and contribute to the core market, you will have to really tailor it, even the platform.On Renaults strategy, you are selling around 10,000 vehicles every month and are the No.1 European carmaker in India. Youve even rattled Suzuki. So, that is saying something. What is the aim? Were you expecting this level of success?I think this is all due to the attractiveness of the product. I think we have some improvement that we can make in terms of competitiveness of our plant because the plants are filled, then we have much better industrial performance, but we are not there. We will have a lot of improvement that we can make into this plant. Yes, after we have seen that the CMF-A and the CMF-A+ platforms are really adequately addressing the needs of the Indian market, we should be much more ambitions, in terms of contribution.You previously mentioned Tata Motors Nano is really an inspiration for the Kwid. What are your thoughts on that and Ratan Tatas vision for the Nano. When Ratan came with the Nano, I congratulated him and he said I was the only one who congratulated him because a lot of people said its a bad idea. No, its a good idea. We came with the Kwid at the end of the day and the Kwid was inspired by the Nano.",2017-03-09,lXEucX98dtVX75KGV4RvrI,"Renault-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn on his plans for the Mitsubishi acquisition, that brands future in India and how he took inspiration from Tata Nano",company,04:32,"Renault making money in India now after selling 100,000 Kwids: Carlos Ghosn"

-0.36,"Ten years after Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) entered fuel retailing in South Africa, the wheel has turned full circle.
				   
				Indias largest private sector company bought a 76% stake in fuel retailer Gulf Africa Petroleum Corp. (Gapco) in August 2007 and hoped to expand its footprint further in the continent. At a time when RIL was struggling with its fuel retailing in India, the move helped RIL deploy its expertise in fuel retailing overseas and find a market for its products outside India.That affair lasted a decade, almost.Last June, RIL announced its intention to sell Gapco to Frances Total SA. On 29 March, the Indian company said it has obtained all approvals to complete the sale of its Gapco stake. RIL was happy with Gapcos performance. Though it was not as huge as its India operations, for 10 years, Gapco did provide RIL with a reason to keep operating in the fuel retail segment. RIL had plans to expand in the neighbouring markets in Africa too, said a person familiar with the decision to sell Gapco, on condition of anonymity.With subsidiaries in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda engaged in petroleum products import, trading and marketing among others, Gapcos revenue for 2015-16 stood at Rs11,723 crore, according to RILs annual report for the year. Currently, Gapco operates 104 fuel retail outlets in the East African region  65 in Tanzania; 30 in Uganda and nine in Kenya. So, why has RIL dropped a subsidiary that seemed to be doing well? The first person cited above and another close to the company said, after India allowed market pricing of fuel, RILs fuel retailing business has recovered and the company wants to put all its energy into expanding in India, the worlds third-largest crude oil consumer. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), India beat Japan as the worlds third-largest crude oil consumer in 2016. India will also become the worlds third-largest-refiner in 2022, surpassing Russia. RIL has always been bullish on the India market. And its management now wants to focus on India. Gapco happened when India operations were down. Then, RIL had decided to put its management bandwidth to use in Gapco. With all international petroleum retailers eyeing the India market, it makes sense to divest in Africa and focus back home, said the second person familiar with RILs move. RIL did not reply to an email sent on Friday. RILs interest in the Indian fuel retailing segment was rekindled in October 2014 when the government freed diesel prices. Petrol was deregulated in June 2010. Like state-owned oil marketing companies, for RIL too, diesel has been the key product, bringing in the maximum volume. Diesel deregulation meant a revival of its fuel outlets. RILs Diesel sales accounted for 14.3% of the total diesel sales in the country, while its petrol sales accounted for 7.2% of total petrol sales in the country in 2005-06, RILs fuel retailing heydays.Since 2008, when crude oil prices rose to $150 a barrel, diesel retail was the monopoly of  Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL), which managed to sell fuel below cost with government support, something not available for RIL. In May 2008, RIL closed its fuel pumps. The company, which at one point explored tying up with oil marketing companies to stay afloat, abandoned the plans after fuel price deregulation. RIL, which had a 12% market share in fuel retailing in 2005, slipped to less than 0.5% in 2014. Since then, it has clawed back to around 3-4%. RIL had spent Rs5,000 crore in setting up 1,470 retail outlets, of which around 1,151 were operational till the third quarter of 2016-17. The company planned to reopen all its fuel retail outlets by the fourth quarter of 2016-17. Last fiscal, RIL also began reporting its fuel retailing figures.

Re-fill costs will be in line with those of a 5kg steel cylinder. An advantage of transparent gas cylinders is consumers can be assured of the quantity of gas. Another plus is they look better and are light in weight.

-1.0,"The sharp pickup in Infosys Ltds revenue growth shows clearly that it has momentum on its side. Another performance metric that has got tongues wagging is the amount of large deals it has won. 
				   
				The company said last month that the total contract value of the large deals it signed last year stood at $2.79 billion, or 45% higher compared with fiscal year 2014-15. But does this mean the companys revenue growth rate will pick up as a result? Note that HCL Technologies Ltds results in the past few quarters have demonstrated adequately that large order wins do not necessarily result in faster revenue growth. According to the company, new order wins dont translate into commensurate incremental revenues because they also contribute towards making up for earlier projects that were completed.This is a moot point. JPMorgan India Pvt. Ltd said in a note to clients: A significant portion of project-based deals come up for renewal every year; (besides), ~20-25% of annuity-deals come up for renewal/backfilling. Unless technology companies such as Infosys have a high success rate with rebids, the existing base of revenues will get eroded. As such, the new large order wins will first help in plugging the gaps that arose because of completed projects, before contributing to growth.At HCL Technologies, large order wins have amounted to over $1 billion each quarter for over 12 quarters, but revenue growth has been declining. Revenue grew by 8.1% in constant currency terms in the March quarter, about half the rate at which it grew in the April-June 2015 quarter.The JPMorgan note says, The renewal pipe is critical to fill. Winning a very high percentage of renewal deals and more crucially, winning additional business from existing clients requires sound mining/farming skills, which we believe is far more important than hunting for big contracts. Of course, all of this is not to say that Infosys lacks in client mining skills. In fact, its quite likely that the increase in order wins is the result of better mining.Even so, its clearly premature to conclude that the sharp increase in the companys deal wins will be sufficient to plug the gaps that arise from completed projects, as well as contribute handsomely to future growth.",2016-05-24,mN7y9qkZCKNeLjw9jVydFN,"The sharp pickup in Infosyss revenue growth shows clearly that it has momentum on its side

-0.25,"Seattle: Microsoft Corp. unveiled a corporate team-chat service that works with its cloud-based Office and Skype products, aiming to take on Slack Technologies Inc. and Atlassian Corp.s HipChat in a growing market.
				   
				The new product is designed to facilitate real-time conversations and collaboration while maintaining and building up that institutional knowledge of a team, said chief executive officer Satya Nadella. The product has team chat, private messages and voice and videoconferencing.Big companies like Microsoft and IBM are showing renewed interest in the corporate-messaging market as customers flock to internet-based tools like Slack for setting up team communications, said Vanessa Thompson, an analyst at IDC. Microsoft relied on Office 365 and other products to rack up almost $10 billion in commercial cloud revenue for the fiscal year that ended 30 June, and is adding services to draw in more customers.Microsoft is trying to get more airtime with customers that might want something to augment their existing investment in Office 365, Thompson said. What we have started to see is a bunch of companies trying to attack the enterprise versions of WhatsApp and consumer messaging. IDC hasnt published a market size or forecast for the space, which it calls workplace application messaging.A preview of the service, dubbed Microsoft Teams, is available now for Office 365 commercial customers in some versions. It will be generally available in the first quarter and will be included in all Office 365 Enterprise and small business versions.Coordinated tasksMicrosofts product allows teams to add what its calling Tabs, to quickly link to frequently used files and applications. These tabs can relate to Microsoft products like the OneNote note-taking program or to outside productsthe company said its adding support for Zendesk and Asana soon. Teams can also bring in notifications from services like Twitter and GitHub. Like Slack, it also supports the usage of botsprograms that chat with users to automate tasks.Its not Microsofts first foray into this areathe company paid $1.2 billion in 2012 to buy Yammer Inc., but hasnt been able to build up the same kind of usage as Slack and HipChat. Slack raised $200 million at a valuation of $3.8 billion in April. The startup, which introduced its product in 2013, said it reached annualized revenue of $100 million over the summer and surpassed 1.25 million paid users. HipChat was founded in 2010 and acquired by Atlassian two years later. That company declined to break out specific numbers for the product.Microsoft said Teams tight connection with Office and ability to do more than chat give it an advantage over rivals, some of which integrate with parts of Office, but not as closely.Just creating another persistent chat tool isnt all that interesting, said Office vice president Kirk Koenigsbauer. The notion of having this hub for teamwork is a new spin on it. Its not for people who just want to have conversations.Race dayNascar racing company Hendrick Motorsports has been trying out Teams and will use it on the track at the Daytona 500 in February, said Matt Cochran, the companys information technology manager. During a race, Hendrick will use Microsofts product to coordinate pit stops and share feedback among teams supporting its four cars. For example, if one car is seeing a certain kind of wear on tires its crew can alert the other three, which have similar equipment, to make adjustments. Chat is important because the crews need information quickly while audio channels of communications are reserved for conversations between the driver and the crew chief.Hendrick was using Slack, but will switch because Teams works more smoothly with the firms existing Microsoft software and has better security, Cochran said.Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft considered acquiring Slack, but the discussions never got serious enough to involve Nadella or the companys board, and it opted instead to build its own similar software, said two people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the process wasnt public. TechCrunch reported Microsofts potential interest in Slack in March.In a very tongue-in-cheek acknowledgment of the competition, Slack took out a full-page ad in the New York Times Wednesday and posted a copy on its website welcoming Microsoft to the field and noting that all this is harder than it looks.Atlassian president Jay Simons said HipChat has an advantage by focusing purely on communicating, while Microsoft Teams is another feature intended to sell Office 365 subscriptions.The success Atlassian has had in focusing on teams has probably been a wake-up call to Microsoft, he said. On one level, you welcome the competition but on the other level, Microsoft is always a little scary because its a huge company with a lot of customers.Bloomberg Beta, the venture capital arm of Bloomberg LP, is an investor in Slack.

				The OMCs and the Maharashtra government have been looking for land for the past 10 months, ever since Union oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan announced the project on 28 December 2015. Rajapur is a city in the Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra, around 385km from Mumbai. The OMCsIndian Oil Corp. Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL)plan to jointly build a 60 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) refinery at a cost of Rs1.5 trillion in two phases of 40 and 20 mtpa.The piece of land identified is exactly what we wanted. It is near a potential port and around 14,000 acres. We recently received a confirmation from the Maharashtra government that they have found the required land. Now MIDC (Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation) will go ahead with the acquisition of this land, said the first of the officials cited earlier. Emails sent to the three OMCs on 28 October remained unanswered. The second of the officials added that the land identified is only for the refinery. We still need some piece of land to set up a jetty and a desalination plant for captive water supply. So we are looking for land for that, he said.Mint had reported in September that the OMCs and the state government were finding it difficult to find 15,000 acres of contiguous land in the Konkan region for the complex. Government officials had asked the OMCs to reduce the land requirement. The first official cited earlier said around 20-30% of the land parcel identified is rocky and the OMCs may need to invest Rs10,000-15,000 crore to flatten this portion of land. However, we are happy that the land that has been finalized, he added. The OMCs will form a special purpose vehicle for the project. While Indian Oil will hold a 50% stake, HPCL and BPCL will hold 25% each. The official said they are keen on bringing in a strategic partner in the project and may rework the equity structure post that. Some international partners have shown interest in the project but they will participate only after we have some concrete plans in place (for the refinery) to present to them, said the official. Pradhan had said on 6 June that the refinery had been offered to Saudi Aramco as a prospective partner.The OMCs have finalized the configuration and petrochemical linkages that the refinery will have. The government has appointed Engineers India Ltd as the technical agency to prepare a detailed feasibility report (DFR). The two OMC officials added that with the identification of the piece of land, the DFR can now be commissioned and that the report may take 8-10 months to prepare. Besides, the process for environmental approvals, deliberations on financing options, tax concessions and various board approvals can be put in place now. An analyst with a domestic brokerage said, India has been an exporter of petroleum products and its existing refineries are also being further expanded. Though the countrys own demand for petro products is growing at a fast pace and there is infrastructure development happening, it remains to be seen how far we will be able to absorb additional supply (of products).",2016-11-03,mcGavvC8r4wdBuQE8a4jyO,"Oil marketing firms, Maharashtra government have been looking for land for the project for the past 10 months",competitor,02:07,Rs1.5 trillion refinery complex to be set up in Rajapur
-0.37,"Bengaluru: Another quarter and another downward revision in growth. 
				   
				Infosys Ltd is expected by at least three brokerages to scale down its full-year dollar revenue growth for the third time this year when Indias second-largest software firm declares its third quarter results on Friday.This is not surprising, considering the negative cross currency impact and also partially, on account of managements inability to give a firm guidance. Still, 2015-16 is turning out to be roller-coaster ride for Infosys chief executive officer (CEO) Vishal Sikka. Till a year ago, Sikka seemed to have settled well and appeared to be enjoying his job (from playing cricket with employees in Mysuru to the after-results parties with senior management ranks).By December, Sikka came across as a different boss, unhappy with the progress made by the company, and heard telling his colleagues how he has been unable to implement things he had planned when he took over the current job in August 2014. In April last year, Infosys projected to grow at-best at 13.8%; now it will end the year in March with a less than 8% revenue expansion.Agreed, falling growth at Infosys mirrors the problems faced by the industry at-large: Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. scaled down its full-year growth on three times last year, and will grow at 9%. However, slow business from clients is just one area of concern. A bigger challenge is that, bit by bit, Infosys early turnaround plans put in place in January 2015, seem to be fizzling out. Retaining senior management is another headache for Sikka. Although overall attrition continues to be stable, five executive vice presidents (EVPs) left Infosys last year, compared to three EVP departures in the first 17 months of Sikkas tenure (1 August 201431 December 2015).Also read: Five things to watch for in TCS Q3 results tomorrowSikkas record to make the company future-ready, by having $2 billion from newer technologies and platforms, and another $1.5 billion from mergers and acquisitions and finally by improving its revenue per employee to $80,000 by March 2021, is patchy at best. This is not to pooh-pooh Sikkas efforts; he has tried his best till now. But Sikkas best seems to have not made a dent in an insular organisation like Infosys. How can Infosys embrace the new technologies if it shies away from acquisitions (Infosys has not made a single acquisition in the last 15 months)? During this time, Wipro Ltd spent over a $1 billion in buying companies. Most worrying is that despite Sikkaa repeated missives to employee to shape-up and embrace automation platforms in projects and learn newer skill sets, Infosyss revenue per employee refuses to improve. Finally, assuaging investor concerns, many of whom are now getting jumpy over some of the founders reported unhappiness with the CEO, is a big challenge. Despite Infosys estimated to grow faster than Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) in the current year, Infosys shares were down 8.4% as against a 7.7% decline in IT index last year. Infosys shareholders increased their wealth by 32.3% (as against a 14.21% return made in IT Index) in the period between 1 August 2014 and 31 December 2015.With this as the backdrop, Mint brings to you five things to watch out for when Infosys declares its earnings on Friday:Revenue forecast: Brokerage BNP Paribas sees Infosys recording a 1.5% sequential decline in dollar revenue (declining 0.5% in constant currency terms) at $2.55 billion for the October-December period. Management is further expected to narrow its full-year dollar revenue growth to less than 8%. This could set alarm bells ringing for investors as this suggests that Sikkas new measures to turnaround the company are taking longer than earlier expected.Senior management exits and steps management is taking to arrest attrition: A bigger headache for Sikka in this financial year is turning out to be the departure among senior management ranks. Exits of senior employees is leading to poor execution, a reason Sikka has conceded in the past behind companys underperformance.Where is the new in old Infosys? To Sikkas credit, Infosys over the last few years has hired people in the areas of artificial intelligence and pushed to embrace automation platforms. But the proof of the pudding is if indeed Infosys has been able to deploy some of these technologies to either improve its profitability or win business from newer companies which are acting as agents of disruption. Has Infosys won any business from companies like Uber or Airbnb or Facebook? It is over two years since Infosys first detailed its ambition of becoming a $20 billion firm by March 2021, and yet the management shies away from disclosing the progress made from monetising platforms.What is the challenge in translating business from large deal wins? Infosys under Sikka has significantly improved its large deal wins in a quarter ($809 million in April-June period and over $1 billion in the July-September period). For some unexplainable reason, this improved deal win is not translating into growth. Management clarity on this theme will be important.Infosys Consulting, BPO and Edgeverve continue to remain weak: Since August 2014, EdgeVerve and Infosys BPO units continue to underperform. Together, both accounted for a little over 13% of its $9.5 billion revenue last year. Infosys consulting was the third weak area at the beginning of this financial year. All three units now have new leaders, and any significant growth for Infosys can come only if there is growth in at-least one of these units.",2017-01-11,mrkAslcCJ8FdoxbvnSQ9GP,"Time is running out, and amid falling growth, its time Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka starts delivering on his new strategy as investors patience runs thin",competitor,09:47,Infosys Q3 results today: Five things to watch out for

				HPCL will hold 74% equity in the joint venture, HPCL Rajasthan Refinery Ltd, while the state government will hold the balance. The agreement signed in the presence of oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan and Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje entitles the company to a viability gap funding of Rs1,123 crore a year for 15 years from the year of commercial production. The funding will be in the form of an interest-free loan to be refunded in subsequent 15 years.The project includes a petrochemicals complex too.

I had a discussion around this with Chandra, and he flew with our CEO and me to Cincinnati, to meet the CIO (chief information officer) of P&G. Chandra personally assured P&G and gave his personal commitment, under which he promised to have oversight, and provided TCSs resources to an industry-changing project. We retained P&G with his support and leadership. But had we lost P&G, it would have had a huge impact on us. So, this is the kind of commitment that underlines the importance Chandra gives to its (TCSs) customers.Chandrasekarans focus on building client engagement is one benchmark CEOs, including his successor Rajesh Gopinathan, will find impossible to match.Gopinathan, who is currently the chief financial officer, will take over as boss from 21 February. However, TCS executives believe that building client engagements will be the least of the worries for Gopinathan in the coming 12-24 months.Chandra will not let go of TCS. So, he will be there to mentor and help Gopinathan, said the first executive.Even by the outsourcing industrys penny-pinching ways, Gopinathan stands out.When most of TCSs rivals are seeing a drop in profitability, Gopinathan has managed to make TCS, with a 26% operating margin, the most profitable outsourcing company globally.Yet, Gopinathan takes over a very different TCS than the one Chandrasekaran inherited in 2009.At 45, Gopinathan is only a year younger than Chandrasekaran when the latter took over TCSs helm in 2009.TCS then was a 142,000-strong company, which had crossed $6 billion in revenue. Eight years later, in 2017, TCS is the countrys largest private-sector employer with over 378,000 employees. Managing a ship of this scale is not easy. Then TCS still had a lot of business to make from deploying engineers to write software codes and roll out ERP (enterprise resource planning software such as SAP), provide customer support, and maintain data centres for Fortune 1000 companies.Now, cloud-computing providers such as Amazon Web Services are eating into the business of TCS and other outsourcing companies. Automation and artificial intelligence technologies pose an existential threat to the way traditional outsourcing companies have done business.Finally, newer technologies such as block chain mean hundreds of thousands of engineers at TCS need to learn, build and offer solutions quickly to its clients.That Gopinathan will have his task cut out is an understatement.

				Infosys cut its full-year dollar revenue forecast for the second time this fiscal, and now expects to grow between 8.2 and 9.2%, and 8-9% in constant currency terms.The sharp cut in FY17 USD revenue growth guidance, despite the recovery in growth momentum in 2QFY17, reflects a shift to a conservative approach on guidance after two successive cuts on the aggressive stance adopted at FY17-start, Pankaj Kapoor, director of India IT services and software equity research at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, wrote in a note. Chief executive officer Vishal Sikka said Infosys was scaling back its growth target because it had performed poorly in the first quarter and on account of near-term uncertainties.Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., which has most of its employees in India, has also cut its revenue growth forecast twice and expects to grow at 8.5-9.5% in 2016. Cognizant follows the calendar year. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Indias largest software services firm, does not give forecasts, but after it reported a poor 0.3% sequential dollar revenue growth on Thursday, it will be a tall task for the company to better the growth rate of 7.1% reported last fiscal year.Worryingly for both Infosys and TCS, it is not just sluggish revenue growth which is of concern. Both firms sounded less confident of maintaining profitability, with Infosys conceding that operating margin may be below its stated range of 25-26%.Infosyss sharp downward revision from the first growth outlook of between 11.8% and 13.8% dollar revenue expansion in April means that Infosys has shaved off $440 million in business from its first projection of adding $1.31 billion in incremental revenue this year. For Infosys, an at-best 9.2% growth means it expects to do $870 million in new business this year compared to $790 million last year.Infosys Ltd shares ended the day 2.53% lower at Rs1,025.70 on NSE even as the Nifty index rose 0.12% to 8,583.40 points.ALSO READ | Is Infosys being overly conservative with its guidance?Infosys said on Friday that revenue for the three months ended 30 September improved 3.5% to $2.58 billion from $2.5 billion in the preceding quarter. This was on account of the company partially recording $20 million in business from the Goods Services and Tax Network project, and a 4.5% growth in business from clients in banking and financial services segment.In constant currency terms, revenue grew 3.9% sequentially. Net profit rose 5.5% to $539 million from $511 million in the April-June period as the company deployed fewer people at expensive overseas client sites. A Bloomberg survey of analysts expected Infosys to report revenue of $2.58 billion and profit of $529.81 million in the September quarter.Operating margin expanded 80 basis points to 24.9% at the end of the September quarter, compared with 24.1% at the end of June. There are a couple of heartening takeaways in Infosyss performance during the second quarter, say analysts. First, a 4.6% sequential increase in business from banking clients suggests that Infosys may be winning customers at the expense of other large technology vendors.Second, Infosys reported over $1.2 billion in large deal wins during this quarter. This means that in little less than 18 months, Infosys has managed to increase its large deal wins from a little over $400 million a quarter to $1.2 billion.Analysts at Citibank said in a note after Infosys declared its earnings that fairly all-round growth in key geographies and verticalsbetter than what peer TCS reported is another positive for the company.

				Sikka was eligible for a $11 million pay including basic salary, variable pay, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance stock options for the year. Incidentally, this is also lower than what Sikka drew in the previous financial year when he took home Rs 48.73 crore. According to Infosys financial statements that outline compensation to key executives, Sikka received only $3.68 million of the $8 million variable component that he was promised. One of the highest paid executives in the Indian IT industry, Sikka took home $0.82 million in variable pay, $1.9 million in RSUs and ESOPs worth $0.96 million, totalling $3.68 million. Sikkas salary was revised from $7.08 million to a handsome $11 million package with effect from April 2016, a move that did not go down well with the founders, including NR Narayana Murthy.

-0.05,"Mumbai: Advancing the legal battle with Tata Sons Ltd, Cyrus Mistrys investment firms have filed an appeal at the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), challenging the rejection of their petition alleging mismanagement and oppression of minority shareholders. 
				   
				Cyrus Investments Pvt. Ltd and Sterling Investments Pvt. Ltd moved the NCLAT on Wednesday against the 6 March order by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that the petition was non-maintainable, said two people aware of the development who requested anonymity.The office of Mistry, who was ousted as Tata Sons chairman on 24 October, declined to comment. NCLT had ruled that Cyrus Investments and Sterling Investments were not qualified to file the petition alleging mismanagement and oppression of minority shareholders at Tata Sons, the holding company of the $103 billion Tata group.The petitioners have failed to convince the court that the application is maintainable, said B.S.V. Kumar, presiding member of NCLT, in the March order. Under the new Companies Act, shareholders are required to hold 10% equity to be qualified to file such a petition. The Act does not define equity to mean only ordinary equity.The two Mistry firms own a combined 18.4% of ordinary equity shares of the Tata group holding firm, but their holding falls below 10% when preference shares are taken into account. According to the Tatas, Mistry firms hold only about 2.17% then.Later, in an order passed on 17 April, NCLT said it would not waive the 10% requirement for the Mistry firms to file the petition. It makes sense for Mistrys firms to approach the appellate body on maintainability and waiver separately as the legal arguments put forward on the two issues were different, said Ramesh Vaidyanathan, founder and managing partner at Advaya Legal, a law firm.The plea on maintainability was based on the fact that equity shareholding of the Mistry firms is above the threshold of 10%. The waiver arguments were on why the tribunal should waive the threshold requirement, said Vaidyanathan. While arguing in favour of the waiver, the Mistry firms had cited concerns on voting and veto rights accorded to Tata trustees on the board of Tata Sons.Assuming that the petitioners are likely to approach the tribunal on waiver and main petition being dismissed, the tribunal may consider merging the appeal against dismissal of maintainability and waiver. This is because the urgency to deal with this matter is no longer there, added Vaidyanathan. As the final order of the 17 April hearing is yet to be released, the firms could not have clubbed the waiver and maintainability petitions, said the first of the two people cited earlier. In a setback to Mistry and his family firms, the NCLT in its 17 April hearing not only refused to grant a waiver from the shareholding requirement, but also dismissed the main petition alleging mismanagement and oppression.The appellate authority typically doesnt interfere with a decision by the lower authority unless theres been a gross injustice, said Tejesh Chitlangi, partner at law firm IC Legal. They (Mistry camp) really will have to bring in something substantial to the appellate tribunal to override the ruling of the lower authority, he said. This looks unlikely as the Mistry firms would have exhausted all the options and played their best card, he said, adding that from here on, more than anything, its going to be a time-consuming exercise.",2017-04-21,oDsH7fRPiOwj8SkFZhdfPI,"Cyrus Mistrys investment firms filed a petition at NCLAT on 19 April, challenging the 6 March order of NCLT declaring the main petition non-maintainable",company,15:07,Cyrus Mistrys family firms challenge NCLT order on maintainability at NCLAT 
-0.17,"Mumbai: Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has pared its holdings in Tata group firms, fearing that a potentially long legal battle between Tata Sons Ltd and its ousted chairman Cyrus P. Mistry will erode its investments. 
				   
				Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and mutual funds have been more optimistic, with the latter increasing their ownership in 12 Tata group firms and cutting their stake in seven. In the December quarter, state-run LIC, Indias biggest investor, cut its stakes in seven out of the 11 Tata group firms it owns stakes in, according to stock exchange data. Twenty-seven Tata group firms are listed. FPIs slashed holdings in nine and increased their holdings in nine Tata group firms. LIC cut its stake by the most in Tata Chemicals Ltd, where it reduced its holding by 73 basis points (bps) to 2.59%. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. In Tata Global Beverages Ltd, it slashed its holdings by 60 bps and by 35 bps in Tata Communications Ltd. Titan Co. Ltd and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd are the only Tata group firms in which LIC increased its stakes during this period.Overall, the value of LICs holdings in listed Tata firms came down by Rs2,371 crore or 6.4% between 24 October, when the Tata Sons board suddenly ousted Mistry, and the end of December. In comparison, the entire market capitalization of Tata listed firm fell by 7.6%.  A lot of things that were kept under wraps have come to the fore after the Tata-Mistry dispute started. So, from an FPI point of view, especially when US markets have started looking up, there is not much reason for them to stay heavily invested in Tata firms for the time being, said the head of a mid-sized asset management firm, requesting anonymity. FPIs too slashed their holdings in Tata group firms such as Tata Elxsi Ltd (3.2 percentage points) and 1.9 percentage point in Tata Motors. On the flip side, foreign investors also raised their stakes in 9 firms, including Trent Ltd by 2.66 percentage points and Indian Hotels Co. Ltd (54 bps). However, given the overall decline in prices of Tata group firmsa trend mirroring the broader marketthe value of FPI holdings in Tata firms fell by 10.9%, or Rs18,131 crore, between 24 October putsch and the end of December. In the three months to December, FPIs sold $6.72 billion worth of shares.LIC is looking to slash its holdings in Tata group firms further gradually over concerns that the ongoing Tata-Mistry feud may continue for several years, diminishing returns on investments, according to two people familiar with LICs investment strategies, including an LIC official. They did not want to be named because the matter is market-sensitive. The Tata-Mistry spat has reached the doors of the National Company Law Tribunal and hearings are on from Tuesday. An email sent to LIC remained unanswered. No one knows how long this will continue and how much damage it will inflict on investments (made) by shareholders. LICs priority has always been its policyholders, said one of the two persons cited above. LIC is the countrys largest insurer with total assets of around Rs21 trillion. Mutual funds in India have, however, chosen to increase their holdings in most Tata group firms, in contrarian bets. They hold stakes in 24 listed Tata group firms, of which 12 saw an increase in MF holdings in the December quarter. During October-December, MFs increased their holding by 2.47 percentage points in Tata Steel. They reduced their stakes in seven Tata firms and the overall value of their holdings fell by 4.6%.  Tata group firms have created a strong brand and these companies are capable of delivering value over a period of time.

-0.17,"Tata Sons Ltd has removed Cyrus P. Mistry as chairman of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and sought to replace him as a director of the software services provider as the fight between the holding company and its former chairman (and significant shareholder) enters a new phase.
				   
				Tata Sons, which has a 73.26% stake in TCS, nominated Ishaat Hussain, a Tata group veteran, as the interim chairman of the company with immediate effect. Thus, Mistry ceases to be chairman of the TCS board, the company said in a stock exchange statement on Thursday.Separately, Tata Sons has requested a shareholder meeting of Indian Hotels Co. Ltd (IHCL) to pass a resolution for the removal of Mistry as director. On 4 November, IHCLs independent directors unanimously backed Mistrys board position as chairman.This could mark the beginning of a protracted battle,  analysts said.Also read: Did Tata Sons violate insider trading norms?According to the articles of association of TCS, as long as Tata Sons (and associates) holds at least 26% of the firm, the holding company has the right to nominate the chairman of the board of directors.People close to Mistry have questioned TCSs move, saying that Tata Sons has the right to only nominate a candidate.TCS had to then convene a board meeting and table the nomination at the board at a meeting or through a circular resolution. Nothing of this nature was done. In pre-meditated haste, by a letter of the same date, TCS has directly gone on to announce that Mistry stands replaced, one of the people said.A TCS spokesperson said the due process was followed. Under Article 90 of the articles of association of the company, the majority shareholders of Tata Sons are vested with the power to nominate the chairman. Accordingly, it informed all the board directors that Hussain is being nominated as the chairman, the spokesperson said. Sumit Agrawal, partner, Suvan Law Advisors, said that under the Companies Act, where articles of association specifically and categorically provide a right to a major shareholder or group of shareholder to nominate a chairman, exercising that right effectively removes the incumbent with immediate effect till a regular appointment of someone else through a shareholder resolution is made.The concept of shareholders right in the modern corporate world denotes the shareholders supremacy in the governance of the business and the affairs of the corporate sector either directly or through their elected representatives, said Agrawal.These shareholders, he pointed out, have certain statutory rights which nobody can take away, except in accordance with prescribed norms under articles and provisions of the Companies Act.That said, the process followed in TCS to nominate a new chairman neednt necessarily be followed in other group companies. Thats because the method of appointment or removal of chairman is incorporated in the articles of association of a company. In Tata Motors, for instance, the right to appoint the chairman lies with the board and not Tata Sons.Also read: Is trust deficit widening on Tatas narrative on Cyrus Mistry?For removing Mistry as a director, shareholder approval is needed and the request for an extraordinary general meeting in TCS by Tata Sons points to that.Under the provisions of the Companies Act, anyone holding at least 10% of a company can call for a shareholders meeting and propose a special resolution to remove directors before the end of their tenure.Amit Tandon, founder and managing director of Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS), a proxy advisory firm, said that the latest move marks the beginning of Tata Sons moving shareholder resolutions to remove Mistry from the board of operating companies.In the case of TCS, as they have more than 70% stake, they are quite confident of pulling it through, he said.In other Tata group operating companies where Mistry is chairman, Tata Sons (plus other group companies that have cross-holdings) owns a 30-35% stake.In Tata Chemicals, whose board met on Thursday, it has only a 29.98% ownership.To pass a resolution supporting the removal of Mistry as director, the Tatas will need a 51% majority. Thus, the role of institutional shareholders, particularly Life Insurance Corp. of India, becomes important.The state-owned insurer holds around 13% each in Tata Steel Ltd and Tata Power, and 10% in Tata Global Beverages Ltd.The vote of institutional investors will be decisive. Perhaps, this is a reason why Tata Sons has come out with a detailed statement today explaining its need to replace Mr. Mistry and also rejecting claims made by him in his letter to the Board of Tata Sons, said a statement by InGovern Research Services Pvt. Ltd.Hussains nomination comes on the heels of a snub the promoters faced on 4 November when independent directors unanimously backed Mistrys board position at Indian Hotels, which owns the Taj group.

				There are only about 58,000 Parsis in India, a nation of 1.2 billion people. Yet, the community has included some of Indias biggest business names, its top nuclear scientists, world-class musicians and several senior military officers including the countrys first field-marshal.Parsis are also known for maintaining their privacy.They should have settled this between themselves instead of what has happened so publicly, said a Parsi woman stepping out of the communitys fire temple in downtown Mumbai.Also read: Tata, Cyrus Mistry put PR teams in place, facing a long battle aheadThe row between Ratan Tata, family patriarch of the sprawling $100 billion salt-to-steel Tata Sons empire, and Cyrus Mistry, a scion of the billionaire Shapoorji Pallonji clan, erupted in public last week. Both families are pillars of the Parsi community, comprised of descendants of Persians who first landed in India in the ninth century.Tata Sons announced on 24 October that Mistry had been removed as chairman of the company. Sources close to the company said Mistrys corporate strategy was seen as transgressing the core Parsi value of working for the greater common good.A five-page email response from Mistry to the Tata board was leaked two days later, containing scathing criticism of the companys corporate governance practices and Ratan Tatas role in some of the companys costliest errors. The two sides have traded barbs on a near-daily basis since then.Also read: Tata listed firms reply to NSE clarifying on Cyrus Mistrys emailWhile business spats are not uncommon in Indias financial capital Mumbai, the public allegations of malfeasance and the central role of two billionaire Parsis has not gone down well in the community.I would say Cyrus, walk out with a little dignity and self respect. Dont wash dirty linen in public. Dont make the press your playground. Fight battles inside boardrooms, said Rumi Behram Balsara, a second-generation shareholder in some Tata group companies.Tata ethosFrom shipyards to textiles, Mumbais Parsis have led the citys commercial development from a group of sleepy fishing villages to one of Asias business capitals.Parsi business houses owned by the Tata, Wadia and Godrej families are at the forefront of Indias corporate world. The Tata empire stretches from Jaguar Land Rover to Tetley Tea, while the Wadia family owns textile and food-product businesses. The Godrej Group owns interests in everything from consumer goods to chemicals.Also read: The fig leaf of corporate governanceParsis follow the Zoroastrian faith, an ancient pre-Islamic religion of Iran. Some of the tenets of the faith like charity and doing good to others have long been woven into the Tata heritage and business ethos. Much of the dividend paid out by Tata Sons gets funnelled into charitable trusts involved in philanthropic work.The crux of the Tata world view, said Morgen Witzel, a UK-based author of a book on the Tata company, is shareholder value should not be an end in itself. Companies are not machines for making money. They exist to provide value and service to their communities; profit is a by-product of that process.That view appears to be at the heart of the boardroom dust-up. Mistry was attempting to gradually transform Tata from a sprawling empire of middling businesses into a much more focused profit-driven enterprise, but that involved decisions like axing businesses and jobs, moves that jarred with the Tata ethos, say sources close to the conglomerate.Over time, the Tatas had built up a fantastic reputation. However, the size and resistance to change meant that many of their businesses were not able to keep up with the times, said Ronny Bharda, a Mumbai-based Parsi businessman. Cyrus Mistry brought about a renewed sense of enthusiasm. He had the ability to bring about change.Eventually, what social good can the house of Tatas do, if they do not earn any money?More than businessSome Parsis believe the community should ignore the spat.The Parsi community isnt the custodian of thoughts, words and deeds of every Parsi, said Baghzaad Bhomisha, a Mumbai-born Parsi settled in Australia, adding Parsis had bigger concerns than the egos and worthless legacies of Parsi billionaires.Mistry, an Irish citizen, was the first chairman in the Tata groups 148-year history to not belong to the Tata family. He was named chair of the group in 2011 after a lengthy search for a replacement for Ratan Tata. In an organization populated by veterans, his anointment at the age of 43 was a marked departure for the Tatas.Mistrys family is also prominent and has long had ties with the Tatas. His elder brother Shapoor runs the Shapoorji Pallonji conglomerate, which is focused on construction and real estate. It also owns the largest individual stake in Tata Sons, after the family trusts headed by Ratan Tata.The two families are related by marriageCyrus Mistrys sister is married to Ratan Tatas half-brother Noel.Mistrys ouster shows a person with a keen business sense only wont work. Tata is built on more than just business, said Kaizad Todywalla, a Parsi who owns a coin auction house in Mumbai.I personally believe you need a Tata to make sure that the ethos of the group or the philosophy behind it remains. Reuters",2016-11-01,oRoGbj4ivMXhf5SHo5yaqI,"The public allegations of malfeasance and the central role of two billionaire Parsis , Rata Tat a and Cyrus Mistry has not gone down well in the communit",company,12:31,Tata vs Mistry shocks Parsi community

According to the holding firms articles of association, a selection committee is needed to both select and replace a chairman. However, the Tatas have said they had sought legal opinion before replacing him, and it isnt clear why Mistry has not pursued this option so far.If relevant, the breach of any contractual shareholder rights may also be alleged in terms of the shareholders agreement at the Tata Sons level. Whether the parties approach arbitration or the courts will also be dependent upon the terms of the said agreement, said Tejesh Chitlangi, partner at law firm IC Legal.Pursuing the corporate governance angle, Mistry could complain to Sebi about these issues, especially the possible violation of the need-to-know principle under securities regulations.Many of allegations in the public domain against Tata Sons pertain to financial irregularities and insider trading for which Mistry can approach CBI, Sebi. According to his statements, the end goal is to achieve better governance practices, so such investigations could lead to short term pain; however, down the line, there would be cleaner processes, said Shriram Subramanian, founder of proxy advisory firm, InGovern.Yet another option is to approach the government. At the heart of the governance reform,  which Mistry wants to institute, lies the relationship of the Tata Trusts with the group operating companies. He has said the government has an inherent obligation to remedy and repair (the) breakdown in the governance of Tata Trusts.In his Monday message, Mistry talked about how the trustees wielded no voting power on Tata Sons shares until 15 years ago, because company law had vested it in the hands of the government.The role of MCA (ministry of corporate affairs) in administering The Companies Act, 2013, and of the ministry of finance in seeking the stand of Sebi and stock exchanges is also involved, since the episode has international ramifications of Indias rankings for business environment, Agrawal of Suvan added.Mistry could present these issues of corporate governance and ethics to institutional investors and ask them to raise questions with the Tatas.We have brought the dialogue on the table, both from the point of view of governance and ethics, and I think that is today in peoples minds. I believe you will see shareholders in the near future demanding (better) governance, Mistry said in an interview on Monday.I also think that the institutional investors should write to Tata Sons seeking that what is their succession plan, because from where we stand, it seems to be completely unclear, said Subramanian of InGovern.Lastly, Mistry and his family can buy shares of the Tata group operating companies from the open market, if he thinks that will best serve his interests as a shareholder in the group.

Besides, while Nasscom estimated FY16 growth at 10.3% in dollar terms, RBI data puts growth in inflows at merely 1.4%.

As the flight attendants handed out newspapers for the passengers to read while on the journey, I couldnt help but notice that Murthy had made front-page news, this time for questioning the extent of the raise given to an executive at Infosys Ltd, the company that he founded over three decades ago along with a few of his junior colleagues. I turned to him and we began a conversation. I shall not focus here on the specific comments about Infosys, but there were several parts of the conversation that covered Murthys philosophy around topics that I have written about in this column before, and which provide insights into the character of the man. 
				   
				Unsurprisingly, we spoke of the social issues being caused by the changes in the way corporations recruit and retain talent. We spoke of organizations such as TopCoder, now part of an Indian IT services firm after the acquisition of its parent by Wipro. TopCoder is a marketplace for computer programmers, who can get compensated for their work through this marketplace without ever having to be an employee of a services firm. It is like a taxi aggregator among programming firms. I have written in this column before about how marketplaces like these can eventually change the construct of the employer-employee contract now prevalent among many firms and have also mused about whether unionization may be around the corner at some Indian IT services firms as the employer-employee relationship construct begins to disintegrate.Murthy explained that there are circumstances where unions can play a pivotal role in ensuring equity. He said the fact that unions look out for employees welfare is inescapable, and proffered the example of the US. According to him, when unionization covered 35% of the American workforce, American labour was better looked after. Now that this figure has slipped to around 15%, the poor have become poorer as corporations and their leaders have followed an Ayn-Rand-esque view of rational self-interest and social Darwinism. Pushing crumbs off ones table and trusting that the aspiring classes in society will have enough is a sure recipe in fomenting labour class unrest, as the recent Brexit and US presidential elections have shown. Murthys opinion is that such unrest is also lying dormant and is barely beneath the surface in India, and that leaders of Indias capitalist revolution cannot afford to blithely ignore this.Also read | Infosys strongly defends COO pay hike criticized by Narayana MurthyWe also spoke of the fledgling experiments with universal basic income (UBI) that have begun to pop up in various corners of the earth.

While classical economics tells us that disruptive changes in labour mechanics such as offshoring and automation only cause a temporary loss in jobs before there is a job shift when people start to work in other fields of endeavour so that they may earn a living, the short-term pain caused by the original job displacement is undeniable. UBI is a well-meaning attempt to alleviate some of that pain. It comes with the same plethora of problems around unemployment doles, but Murthys view was that societies have a responsibility to their underprivileged or displaced populaces and that he would welcome higher taxes on the IT industry that are meant to go directly to those whose jobs IT displaces. He said that the only society that is stable is one that is seen to be moving, however haltingly, towards an atmosphere of equity and fairness among all its members.Leaders in the IT industry need to be seen as fair by the people under their command. Giving raises at the top that are 10 or even 20 times the rate of the raises being given at the bottom runs the risk of creating an impression that those at the top are greedy opportunists most interested in snatching what they can while the going is good. I have been part of a company where the boss raised his own salary by over 250%, leaving others in his second line like me to explain to the rest of the workforce that they had to make do with a 2% increase. The rationale for the anaemic salary increase for everyone but the boss was that the firm had not reached its (internally set) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, targets. As an aside, I am sure the bosss new salary contributed to the company repeating this miss in the next year. That year, even though my own compensation increase was also in the low single digits, I felt great discomfiture at having to justify and explain the bosss salary increase, which the board had seen right to give him since he could easily get another job in the industry paying just as much. To paraphrase the Bard of Avon, all the mouthwash in India has not cured me of the ensuing halitosis from those conversations.Recalling a time when the industry finally saw the light and banded together in the common interest to fight high levels of attrition when companies were blithely poaching talent from one another, I asked Murthy whether Nasscom or some such industry body could now be entrusted with this looming question of fairness. He was unequivocal that an ombudsman is needed. Maybe it is time we allow ourselves to be policed.Siddharth Pai is a world-renowned technology consultant who has led over $20 billion in complex, first-of-a-kind outsourcing transactions.",2017-04-03,ozanrVoibOjSFCXrGeAaeL,"In IT firms such as Infosys, giving raises at the top many times the rate of the raises at the bottom risks creating an impression that those at the top are greedy opportunists ",both,23:55,"Infosys compensation row: Of executives, programmers and fairness"
-0.58,"Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw is the chairperson and managing director at Biocon Ltd, a biotechnology firm. Named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time magazine in 2010, Mazumdar-Shaw is recognized as much for her entrepreneurial expertise as she is for her philanthropy. This year, she became the second Indian to take the Giving Pledge, which encourages billionaires to give away their wealth for social good. In an interview conducted by Bridgespan in partnership with Mint, she explains that her philanthropic efforts are focused on healthcare, and makes a distinction between charity and philanthropy.  Edited excerpts: 
What motivated you to start your philanthropic journey and where did you go for advice?I belong to the breed of first-generation entrepreneurs who have basically created our enterprises with very frugal resources. Being in a field like healthcare, for me as someone who is basically on a mission to make a global impact in terms of affordable access to healthcare, I am very, very concerned about the fact that there are a large number of people in this world who need to have some access to basic rights, whether it is in education or healthcare. This is a huge global challenge which I think every one of us who has been fortunate enough to create the kind of wealth we have created, needs to do something about.Inherently I have a social conscience which my late father inculcated in me. He was not exactly a very wealthy man but he was very concerned about the underprivileged, about the people who didnt have equal opportunities.Can you talk about your portfolio of philanthropic works? You mentioned you work in cancer, and initiated work in diabetes.My philanthropy is largely focused on healthcare and I really want to make a difference to peoples lives. The poor are absolutely neglected and they are abused in many ways, because the system just totally ignores their needs, so I have also sort of allocated some part of my philanthropy funds to primary healthcare. In primary healthcare again, I want to use technology in a big way, because I feel that we have got to leapfrog if we have to make any difference to society. I have helped to create what are called ilaaj (diagnosis) clinics and we use technology to diagnose early so that you can treat early and the outcomes become better.These are experimental times but for me philanthropy is about catalyzing a process. It is not about doing the governments job, which very often the government believes is what philanthropy is. I dont ascribe to that at all. I believe that in philanthropy, there are certain things where you can make a big difference like you know building hospitals where you can actually deliver affordable healthcare. I think the government needs to partner with philanthropists and with corporate social responsibility to experiment with new ideas, and that is a form of philanthropy that can really transform.For you, what has translated from your for-profit experience into your philanthropy?Philanthropy has to be sustainable, and thats why I will make a big distinction between charity and philanthropy. Charity has generally a sort of temporary effect and is about giving fish to a hungry man rather than teaching a person how to fish. Philanthropy changes somebody elses life in a meaningful way.How is new philanthropy different from traditional philanthropy?I think old wealth understands philanthropy and they do have a lot of philanthropic programmes to show for it, like in the case of the Birlas or Tatas. They do have a lot to show in terms of philanthropic outcomes; they have created educational institutes, hospitals and other kind of institutions. New wealth takes time to understand what philanthropy is about, because when you create new wealth, your first immediate reaction is I got to make sure that I keep that wealth for a rainy day.What can be done to stimulate philanthropy in India?Philanthropy is about setting an example and I think many of us first-generation entrepreneurs who have built very successful businesses have come together under the India Philanthropy Initiative (IPI) that Mr (Azim) Premji started. Ratan Tata was also one of the co-conspirators. I would say that many of us who belong to IPI, like Nandan and Rohini Nilekani, are like-minded people when it comes to philanthropy. We all believe that every generation has to create new wealth and the wealth that you have created, a large part of it must go back into making the society better, to make a difference to the ones who have been wronged in the society. Every one of us who has created this kind of wealth in India in recent times has demonstrated a social conscience, whether it is Infosys or Wipro, or Biocon.What advice do you give to the new philanthropists who are early in their journey?I always tell people to ask themselves: where do you think you can make a difference and why do you want to make that difference. New philanthropists tend to feel overwhelmed by the needs of society. How do you decide to focus on certain things and say no to other things?Its not just about being a new philanthropist. Even seasoned philanthropists get absolutely bombarded by requests. Everyone comes with great ideas and how wonderful their initiative is and why you should be helping them. As a philanthropist, you have to be very clear on what you are trying to do. If something that is being done actually aligns with what you are doing, then it is very clear that you can actually help this person. But more often most requests dont quite align with what you are trying to do, so it is very easy to say no. Personally I back ideas where I know that the person is very passionately involved with that initiative because again it is about sustainability. Youve got to have ownership of what you are doing.What can strengthen Indian philanthropy?I believe that investing in incubators and accelerators through an angel investment is also extremely important, provided that you are not looking for a return on that investment and are prepared to reinvest whatever returns you make on such investments. To me as a first-generation entrepreneur I know how tough it is to build a business and to scale it up, so I think philanthropic funds should also help others to build social businesses.What are the things that you do to be able to delegate in your philanthropy?You do need to make sure that you build a philanthropic organization or an administrative cell that really looks at your philanthropy very objectively. In most of my kind of philanthropic initiatives, I have really invested in such a way that I leave it to the investees to really take my philanthropy forward. For instance, at the hospital project, I just leave it to the administration of the hospital to make sure that they leverage what I have given them into a very big opportunity.ALSO READ | Govt policy should make it easier to give: Rohini NilekaniALSO READ | You really want to be doing things that make a difference: Ratan TataThe Bridgespan Group, an adviser and resource for mission-driven leaders and organizations, in partnership with Mint interviewed several philanthropists across India to trace their journeys and share their learningsConversations with Remarkable Givers: India.

0.28,"Oil majors including Statoil, Shell and Chevron are experimenting with various technologies, from drones and drill design to data management, to drive down costs and weather a deep downturn. 
				   
				Crude prices have more than halved since mid-2014, forcing companies to cut billions of dollars in costs. Determined to shield dividends and preserve the infrastructure that will allow them to compete and grow if the market recovers, they are increasingly looking to smarter tech and design to make savings. French oil and gas major Total said it was now using drones to carry out detailed inspections on some of its oil fields following a trial at one of its Elgin/Franklin platforms in the North Sea. Cyberhawk, the drone company that led the trial, said this kind of work was previously carried out by engineers who suspended themselves from ropes at dizzying heights. It said the manned inspection used to take seven separate two-week trips with a 12-man team that had to be flown in and accommodated on site.The drones do the work in two days and at about a tenth of the cost, according to the UK-based firms founder Malcolm Connolly, who said it had also worked with ExxonMobil, Shell, ConocoPhillips and BP. Total declined to comment on how long the manned or drone inspections took, or specify how much money was saved.Statoils giant Johan Sverdrup field, the largest North Sea oil find in three decades, is a leading industry case study for cutting costs in the era of cheap oil.The firm has cut development costs for the first stage of the project by a fifth compared with estimates in early 2015, to 99 billion crowns ($12.2 billion). The savings have largely been made by focusing on the most efficient technology and designs from the beginning, Statoils technology head Margareth Oevrum, told Reuters in an interview. Executives say the growing attention on technologies that have been around for some time shows how wasteful the global industry had been in the years before the downturn.For example, simply finding a more efficient route for the oil pipeline that would carry the crude from the Sverdrup field to the onshore refinery cut 1 billion crowns, Statoil said. It has also developed a drilling template that is acting as a guide for the first eight wells to be drilled at the field. It said it had reduced the overall drilling time by more than 50 days, saving about 150 million crowns per production well.Global upstream oil and gas spending has fallen by more than $300 billion across the industry in 2015-16, according to the International Energy Agency. Around two-thirds comes from cost cuts, it said. Alex Brooks, oil and gas equity analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said tech innovation in the industry was about 100 tiny things, adding: The bottom line is you end up with a much lower cost.Another way firms are looking to cut costs is by using their vast amounts of data to better predict their needs. Since the price slump, firms such as Shell, ExxonMobil and Statoil have started using software to better manage their data to cut wastage in the ordering of construction materials. Gunnar Presthus, Nordic energy lead at consultancy Accenture, who advises oil majors and national oil firms, said the downturn had led to the industry waking up to the potential of the data they store. The oil industry, to some extent, is one of the most digitalized industries, he said. Companies are now able to use this wealth of data to make changes that will save money.",2016-10-17,pK4u37UCcXUpnNABQ8lkvL,"Crude prices have more than halved since mid-2014, forcing oil companies to cut billions of dollars in costs and look at smarter tech and design",competitor,01:50,Oil giants explore new technologies to cut costs

The algorithm diagnoses the condition with over 90% accuracy by analysing retinal fundus photographs and will probably eliminate the need for an ophthalmologist at the diagnosis stage. Strangely, nobody, including its creator, knows what exactly the algorithm is looking for in the photographs as the algorithm has trained itself rather than being told what and where to look. 
				   
				Our world is being shaped by the intersection of multiple emerging as well as some entirely new technologies. Self-driving cars, drones and intelligent homes are already accepted as inevitable. In other industries, we might witness a shift to consumerization in energy, i.e. the way that energy is produced and distributed, relying heavily on naturally available sources, new storage methods and intelligent grids. We will see the dawn of an entirely new way of commerce, of transparency and efficiency enabled by technology. One doesnt have to look hard to find examples which show that technology is becoming core and inseparable from innovation in every industry. Artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, the Internet of Things, blockchain and many game-changing technologies are coming of age. At the same time, digital is becoming the de facto approach to buying products, services and experiences. The fast-moving landscape on both sides of demand and supply will make most 10-year predictions seem tame in hindsight.Thanks to its unique vantage point over the last three decades, the Indian IT industry has an opportunity to shape these global forces. It has earned its stripes based on the seemingly unassailable value proposition of cost, scale and quality. It has been successful in constantly reinventing service excellence across a broad range of technology, business processes and engineering services. However, this may no longer be enough. To win in the next decade, the industry may need, in some sense, to be an antithesis of the past. Past winning factors of cost, scale and predictability will need to pivot to value-based, agile and innovative, i.e. be true digital co-partners, while helping customers ruthlessly drive efficiencies in their operations. Innovation in AI and robotic process automation platforms and technologies will play a critical role in helping achieve almost unimaginable levels of automation. Winning in the new paradigm thus implies the need for a significant shift in capabilities, skill sets, delivery models and new relationships/partnerships. Capabilities are shifting from technology based to business solution oriented, skills from generalists to specialists with a broad range of expertise, delivery models from off-shore to agile and as a service based, and stakeholders are shifting from calling only on the chief information officer (CIO) to business, functional and IT. Workforce transformation through upskilling and multi-skilling will be essential in the new landscape. Working in cross-function agile teams, imbibing and practising design thinking will need to become second nature to a large majority of technology workers who have traditionally focused on narrow technical excellence.Developing leading-edge capabilities will require an almost boundary-less approach to developing IP (intellectual property) and solutions through an effective external ecosystema combination of investment and participation in innovation ecosystems such as start-ups, academia and venture capital ecosystems. While thats a lot of change to deal with in a short time frame, it is also an opportunity to create value on a much larger scale. India has a large and growing market for digital products and services and a start-up landscape. Government-led initiatives like Digital India can be real catalysts for the change, providing the impetus to leapfrog in innovation ahead of other, slower- growing economies.It will take a sense of purpose, a pioneering spirit and a start-up culture to realize this vision. At a time when globalization is facing some scepticism and headwinds, the industry can be a beacon of hope, showing the power of ideas, innovation and technology to create economic and social value across borders and without bias.

-0.25,"Mumbai:  Indias largest software firm, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), has named its chief financial officer, Rajesh Gopinathan, to succeed N. Chandrasekaran (popularly called Chandra) as the chief executive officer. 
				   
				Chandrasekaran was named chairman of Tata Sons on Thursday.Mumbai-based TCS also appointed N.G. Subramaniam as the new chief operating officer, thereby creating the CEO-COO model after seven years. Chandrasekaran was COO before becoming CEO in 2009. Subramaniam, who is also Chandrasekarans elder brother, is president of a business unit, TCS Financial Solutions.

Rajesh is a very meticulous and articulate guy. Above all, Chandra trusts him completely and so will rely on him to execute his vision, said one executive. I dont see Chandra letting go at TCS and hell still work closely with Rajesh, this person, who asked not to be identified, added. Once he takes over as Tata Sons chairman, Chandrasekaran is also expected to take over as chairman of TCS.Gopinathan, 46, was handpicked by Chandrasekaran when he joined TCS from Tata Industries in 2001. He worked across different geographies and units before being appointed CFO in 2013. Gopinathan is an alumni of Regional Engineering College, Trichy (now National Institute of Technology), and the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.

Rajesh sometimes used to override even Chandra when it came to pricing. He would quiz you to the point where you could just not hide anything.

-0.34,"Mumbai: Dell Technologies chairman and chief executive officer Michael Dell is determined to change the common perception of his companythat its a traditional maker of low-margin products like personal computers, servers and storage systems.
				   
				The view changed little even after Dell said in October 2015 that it will buy EMC Corp. Now that the merger of the two companies is complete, Dells strategy to alter this view is revolving around quickly rolling out new infrastructure products that have been jointly developed by Dell and EMC teams, cross-selling them to clients of both, strengthening existing partnerships with firms like SAP AG, Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp., and forging new ones even with competitors like Amazon Web Services Inc.Dell executives say they are best suited to help clients go digital with the combined entitys broad technology portfolio, which not only comprises computing products but also services and solutions in the areas of hybrid cloud, software-defined data centres and converged- and hyper-converged infrastructure (integration managed by software), platform-as-a-service, data analytics, mobility and cybersecurity.This multipronged strategy was evident when Dell took the stage at the first-ever Dell-EMC World 2016 event in Austin, Texas, on 18 October, and gave an impassioned speech that had all the trappings of a successful road map for next-gen computing.Beginning with a reiteration of the Go Big or Go Home, Baby! slogan delivered at last years Dell event, he peppered this years speech with technology buzzwords like digital, the Internet of things (IoT), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI).Alluding to Dells Digital Transformation Index , Dell underscored the presence of a digital fear among the 4,000 business leaders across 16 countries and 12 industries that were surveyed as part of a recent report. His pitch: This (digital) future is coming very rapidly and the future does not care whether you are ready. But we do... (We are) the trusted provider of essential infrastructure for the next industrial revolution.Dell evidently believes in economies of scale, made evident by his Go Big slogan. The Dell-EMC merger, announced last October, was the largest deal in tech history, topping Avago Technologies Ltds $37 billion purchase of Broadcom Corp.Dell Technologies is now a $74 billion company that comprises a PC business and affiliated businesses including virtualization (the partitioning of a physical server into smaller virtual servers in a bid to reduce costs) company VMware Inc., security firms RSA Security Llc and SecureWorks Inc., software and services (including cloud and Big Data analytics) company Pivotal Software Inc., and cloud management software firm Virtustream Inc. Dells eponymous combined business now comprises two segmentsDell EMC is the sub-brand for the companys enterprise business, including products and solutions, and Dell is the sub-brand for the companys client solutions for consumers, business and institutional customers.Dell plans to go about the task of ramping up business growth also by touting that the combined company stands as a market leader in many of the most important and high-growth areas of the information technology (IT) market, including positions as the Leader in 20 Gartner Magic Quadrants and a portfolio of more than 20,000 patents and applications.Does the pecking order bear out Dells claim?To be sure, the worldwide IT spending figure augurs well for technology companies like Dell Technologies, which figures in the top three in PCs, servers and storage.Overall IT spending is forecast to reach $3.5 trillion in 2017, up 2.9% from estimated spending of $3.4 trillion this year, according to Gartner Inc. According to the research firm, software and IT services segments have been the bright spots. Software spending is projected to grow 6% in 2016 and another 7.2% in 2017 to total $357 billion, while IT services spending is forecast to grow 3.9% in 2016 to $900 billion and 4.8% in 2017 to $943 billion.ALSO READ | Dell Technologiess road map for IndiaThe total worldwide enterprise storage systems factory revenue remained flat year-on-year at $8.8 billion during the second quarter of 2016, according to research firm International Data Corporations (IDCs) Worldwide Quarterly Enterprise Storage Systems Tracker. EMC and HPE (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) accounted for 18.1% and 17.6% of spending, respectively, of the enterprise storage market (IDC declares a statistical tie when there is less than 1% difference in the revenue share of two or more vendors.). Dell held the next position with 11.5% share of revenue during the quarter. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and NetApp Inc. accounted for 6.8% and 6.7% of global spending, respectively.Sales of server-based storage were up 9.8% during the quarter and accounted for almost $2.4 billion in revenue. External storage systems remained the largest market segment, but the $5.7 billion in sales represented flat year-on-year growth. However, according to Liz Conner, research manager of storage systems at IDC, spending on all flash-based storage deployments continues to grow and help drive the market, following the decreasing cost of flash media, deployments and availability of flash-based storage products (a sharp focus area for the combined entity, Dell Technologies).ALSO READ |In firms, PCs and smartphones coexist in a multi-device world: Michael DellIn the same period, worldwide server revenue declined 0.8% year-on-year, while shipments grew 2% from the second quarter of 2015, according to Gartner. Dell moved into the top spot in shipments, while HPE remained the worldwide leader in server revenue.Dell garnered 19.3% of the market and moved into the No. 1 position in worldwide server shipments due primarily to growth resulting from programmes it has in place in the Asia-Pacific region, most notably in China. HPE continued to lead the x86 server (Intel-based server) market in revenue with 26% of the market. IBM secured the third position with 9.1% of the market, but experienced the largest decline among the top five vendors, according to the Gartner report.Contrarian betsNotwithstanding the scepticism over the merger, there is certainly some merit in Dells claim over the economies of scale that this merger can achieve even as there remain formidable challenges that continue to keep some analysts and clients sceptical. The challenges include concerns over the sum paid for the acquisition, integration challenges, some overlap in products and technologies between Dell and EMC, leadership issues in the combined entity, and partnership conflicts since some Dell partners compete with EMC and VMware.Michael has an opportunity to redefine computing if he reinvests on innovation and can pare back the debt, said R Ray Wang, principal analyst, founder and chairman of Silicon Valley-based Constellation Research Inc. He, however, pointed out that customers and partners remain sceptical, wondering if this is an exercise to sell off the parts of the acquisition to pay down debt and save Dell, or a strategic play to own the cloud and the future of the data centre.Shedding the enterprise software assets leads us to believe that this may not be an innovation play yet but a move to sell off assets to save Dell. The experience at HP Enterprise is what customers are scared of. They dont want to see their favourite vendors exit the market where massive investments have been made. The challenge is having two legacy players come together for innovation. The math in the accounting makes it hard to believe what innovations will come about. Dell did attempt to address this road map at Dell World but most of our clients remain sceptical, said Wang.Dell is also a contrarian when it comes to defying certain technology trends. For instance, Dell became a private company on 5 February 2013, in a deal led by Silver Lake that was valued at $24.9 billionthe biggest leveraged buyout since the financial crisiseven as other tech firms seek stock market listings. Second, he believes in mergers and acquisitions even as competing companies like Hewlett Packard have split their businesses. Third, while the world is betting on smartphones, his company no longer makes them.I dont think the world needs another smartphone company, says Dell. A smartphone is just another node, explains Dell, adding that all the information you get on a smartphone comes from a data centre. And what you upload, goes back to the data centre.This, for Dell, is a business opportunity since his company provides servers that are used by data centres.Wang agrees that the smartphone market is a bad one to be in and is not worth it when you dont own the OS (operating system).However, the fact is that even as Dell remains optimistic over the future of the PC (desktops and laptops), worldwide PC shipments totalled 68.9 million units in the third quarter of 2016, a 5.7% decline from the third quarter of 2015, according to the preliminary findings of Gartner. This was the eighth consecutive quarter of decline in PC shipmentsthe longest streak in the history of the PC industry.Lenovo Corp. continued to be the worldwide market leader based on preliminary PC shipments, but HP Inc. is nearly tied for this top spot. Segment-wise, Dell claims his company is No. 1 in PCs in terms of revenue but Dell ranked third in terms of shipments with a share of 13.5% in the third quarter of 2016. (All these rankings could change when final shipment results are published by Gartner.) Dell is insistent that revenue is more important than shipments.Banking on innovationWe have been growing (the PC business) for 15 quarters. We want to be profitable so that we can reinvest in innovation, he says. Part of his companys innovation is around the PC computing system, as Jeff Clarke, vice- chairman of operations and president of client solutions, puts it. There is much innovation in the PC computing system... like the computer becoming personal and new experiences with AR/VR that provide users with new ways to interact, explains Clarke. In a 7 September blog, Clarke also points out that beyond the device, workforce transformation requires a cloud-based infrastructure to support peoples new behaviors, new devices and new expectations, which EMC can provide. He also underscored the importance of Airwatch (now a Dell company) as an EMM (enterprise mobility management) solution for managing phones and tablets.And with cloud client-computing VDI (virtual desktop infrastructure solutions) from VMWare, we are the only true end-to-end VDI provider in the industry, from planning to deployment, data center to the endpoint, on- and off-premise. Bottom line: Combining EMCs cloud capabilities with our award-winning PCs, we have just created a very powerful solution, wrote Clarke.For instance, the Dell-EMC product collaboration has resulted in products like VxRaila hyper-converged infrastructure solution from VMware that includes fifth generation Intel Xeon processors and Dells PowerEdge servers. As opposed to a converged infrastructure model (also known as hardware-defined) where the server, networking and storage can be separated if needed, in a hyper-converged infrastructure (referred to as software-defined) the components are integrated and hence cannot be split.The other part of innovation revolves around Dells belief that IoT is fundamentally changing businesses. Explaining his rationale for why we created Dell Technologies, Dell says the planet is becoming more intelligent and more connected by the minute, and ultimately will become intertwined with a vast Internet of Things, paving the way for our customers to do incredible things.Dell elaborated in his speech that as the cost of making something intelligent approaches zero dollars, intelligence is being embedded into every aspect of our physical world. We have about 8 billion connected devices on the planet, and 15 years from now there will be 200 billion or more, and all these sensors and nodes in those devices will provide access to a host of new digital applications, creating massive new sources of information. Using this information to provide better insights and build a better world may be the biggest opportunity in history, he said.Using the premise that everything improves about 10x every five years, Dell in his speech also envisioned a future with smart cities, driverless cars and nanobots that cure cancer and repair cell damage. He added that overnight shipping will seem like snail mail compared to the instant gratification of drone delivery... AR and VR will redefine work, learning and play... machine learning, deep learning, AI and unsupervised learning to all this data will unleash a torrent of innovation and progress and solve some of the worlds greatest challenges.Towards this end, Dell and EMC have made a cumulative research and development (R&D) investment of $12.7 billion over the past three years and plan to invest $4.5 billion in R&D this year, which is multiple times what the competition is investing, Dell said.Dell, for instance, has invested in six worldwide global command centres where technicians constantly monitor events like flight delays, traffic jams, weather conditions, earthquakes or even unsettling events like riots that might impact the companys ability to handle a support call. The technicians track live tweets, live broadcasts of news and weather, and map the location using geographical information systems and Google Earthall in a single window using a customized interface. India (Bengaluru) does not have a global command centre but has a social media listening command centre.In June, Dells Extreme Scale Infrastructure group unveiled Tritona liquid cooling technology that scores over traditional air-cooled solutions for data centres. It designed this water-based system to cool server chips (developed with Intel Corp.) in eBay.coms data centres.In an 18 October note, Mike Krell, lead IoT analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, agreed that Dell Technologies was uniquely positioned to help customers solve their IoT puzzle. Dell, Krell wrote, combines experience and credibility with specific vertical market enterprises, a curated partner ecosystem with deep vertical knowledge, the industrys broadest offering of IoT-focused infrastructure, and an ability to provide a world-class customer experience to help customers solve specific IoT problemstoday.But will Go Big work for Dell?Dells growth strategy also revolves around acquisitions, which Dell says will continue. Ever since Michael Dell returned to the company as its chief executive in 2007, the company has spent as much as $15 billion on more than 30 acquisitions prior to the $67 billion EMC purchase. These included EqualLogic ($1.4 billion; storage area networks, where EMC dominates), Perot Systems ($3.9 billion; IT services), SecureWorks ($612 million; security services, where EMCs RSA division has a big presence), Force10 ($700 million; data centre Ethernet switches) and Quest Software ($2.4 billion; system management and security software), among others.However, not all of those acquisitions have done well for Dell, including some with a significant presence in the Indian market (security provider SonicWALL, for instance). According to a 20 June report on TechCrunch, while Dell had reportedly paid $3.6 billion for Quest Software and SonicWALL, it was only able to recoup around $2 billion for the duo when it sold them to private equity firm Francisco Partners and hedge fund Elliott Management. Dell also had to sell Perot Systems to Japans NTT Data Corp.  for $3.1 billion in March.Nevertheless, analysts like Ashish Nadkarni, program director for IDCs worldwide infrastructure practice, believe that having a bigger, more full-service portfolio allows the combined company (Dell Technologies) to address a wide range of use cases in a very holistic fashion. In a 16 April note, he pointed out that these solutions could be diverse and even emerging, like IoT and real-time analytics. Dell and EMC can likewise take advantage of synergies when it comes to joint go-to-market efforts around compute, storage, and networking solutions,  wrote Nadkarni.He also believes that since Dell Technologies is a privately-held company, it will be able to offer the flexibility of interesting product road maps and solutions as well as additional purchasing options, like subscription-based offerings, free from the 90-day shot clock pressures typically exerted on public companies.On his part, Dell is clear that his company needs to savour customer relationships. He concludes: There are many customers who do not want to change, and we dont want to change them. There are plenty of opportunities for cross-selling. When we looked at the top 5,000 Dell customers and the top 5,000 EMC customers, we found only 1,000 common ones. So there are enormous opportunities to cross-sell among the portfolio. Customers are excited about that toothey actually like the fact that we are bringing everything together with these engineered and integrated solutions. Thats what we are focused on.",2016-11-15,qV03Hr8aiVWnLwqzhDJqpM,Dell is leveraging its EMC acquisition to offer services and solutions for companies to cope with the fast-transforming digital landscape,both,04:42,Will Dell make it big with EMC?
-0.63,"Wipro Ltd, for now, is lagging behind Infosys Ltd in growth. Still, when it comes to mergers and acquisitions (M&As) and investments in start-ups made by the two rivals over the last two years, Infosys Ltds boss Vishal Sikka may want to look at Wipros playbook, overseen by chief strategy officer Rishad Premji. 
				   
				Rishad Premji is the son of Wipro chairman Azim Premji, and reports to Wipro chief executive officer Abidali Neemuchwala.Over the last year, Infosys, surprisingly, has shied away from buyouts, despite spending $390 million to purchase three firms in the first year of Sikkas tenure (see chart). Infosys is grappling with finding a stable management team to steer its M&A division. In July this year, Sikka asked Deepak Padaki to head the M&A team, just 18 months after Infosys reposed faith in Sikkas former SAP colleague, Ritika Suri, to oversee the M&A division.Finally, the pace of investments in start-ups made by Infosys has slowed; the firm has made only two investments since January. Infosys has spent some $33 million (out of its $500 million fund to invest in start-ups) to buy stakes in eight start-ups and an undisclosed amount in Vertex Ventures, a Palo Alto-based venture capital firm. Seven of these investments were made in 2015.M&A is an important theme for Infosys as the management expects $1.5 billion in new revenue from buyouts as part of Sikkas ambitious target of hitting $20 billion in revenue by March 2021. The three buyouts made by Infosys, for now, are estimated to bring less than $90 million in revenue.Wipros strategy is the most aggressive among home-grown IT firms, and can become a template for both Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys, its bigger rivals, in how to better deploy cash and also invest in areas which can make outsourcing companies future-ready.Wipro, in the last 18 months (since April last year, when Neemuchwala joined the company as chief operating officer), has spent over $1.13 billion in making four buyouts which, in addition to making the firm future-ready, together bring in over $550 million in revenue. TCS boss N. Chandrasekaran has not made a single buyout or an investment in start-ups in the last two years. Wipro has done a better job of M&A than most IT services firms to date, said Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm. They (Wipro) have been more deliberate whereas Accenture has been very aggressive, although the net results are the same. Wipro has got new service mixes and capabilities along with new clients. One aspect is the emphasis of taking company cultural considerations into play.Wang said that it appears that Infosys has slowed down M&As and venture activities. Infosys maintains that it continues to evaluate firms and start-ups and there is no slowdown in decision-making. Im very focused that every business unit should not have more than one acquisition to integrate and digest, Neemuchwala told Mint last week, explaining that M&As will bring in a significant share of revenue in Wipros ambition of becoming a $15 billion firm by 2020.Wipro has spent over $22 million (of a $100 million fund) in picking minority stakes in seven start-ups and a venture fund.Sikkas and Rishad Premjis style of running their M&A and venture arms is also different, as none of Infosyss executives, including Suri (who oversees Infosys Innovation Fund), have any experience in the venture capital space. In contrast, Wipros venture arm is run by Venu Pemmaraju, a former senior investment manager at Intel Capital, and company executive Biplab Adhya, who both report to Rishad Premji.One of the biggest benefits Wipro has accrued from its buyouts is that it has managed to retain the tag of Indias third largest software services firm, leaving HCL Technologies Ltd to be content at the fourth position.Wipro does not spell out the growth brought in from its four buyouts and the organic growth, but a senior executive conceded that the growth in core IT services has considerably slowed down. If Wipro manages to grow at the upper end of its 2% growth forecast in the fourth quarter, it will add $445.3 million in incremental revenue in calendar year 2016. The four buyouts are estimated to have accounted for at least $350 million in new business, translating to about 78% of all new business.HCL Technologies, which reported $6.23 billion in yearly revenue at the end of March 2016, will end with $7.04 billion in revenue at the end of March next year if it manages to grow at the managements at-best 13% annual guidance. Wipro, which does not give annual growth guidance, is expected by analysts to report at-best 5.5% growth, translating to the company recording $7.75 billion in revenue at the end of the current financial year.",2016-10-29,qeaQ9hDqenc00ogIsHBKlM,"Wipros M&A strategy, overseen by Rishad Premji, is the most aggressive among home-grown IT firms, and can become a template for TCS and Sikkas Infosys",competitor,00:03,Has Wipros Rishad Premji triumphed over Infosyss Vishal Sikka? 
-0.25,"If you are looking to embark on the human resources (HR) analytics journey, look no further than the good old recruitment process.
				   
				Once the process starts, recruiters use the recruitment brief and their judgement to shortlist candidates for interviews. Firms typically have huge amounts of historical data on employees who have performed well and those who have not. This clustering of employees can serve as a benchmark in selecting new ones. Top employees outperform average employees by up to eight times, so historical data has great potential.The interview process has various stages and there are dropouts in every stage. The questions to be asked are: what stage sees the most dropouts and why? Is it due to of low compensation figures, or is the process is taking too long? If low compensation is the reason, what is the delta that will lead to better salary elasticity?Among those that are hired many drop out in the first six months. The questions here are: what made them quit, and how can the firm identify the kind who are likely to leave soon?These questions indicate how data-led approaches can help transform the recruitment process. There are opportunities that lead either to process improvementsthe domain of efficiencyor to better HR decisionsthe domain of effectiveness. An analysis by McKinsey and Co. found recruitment efficiency can be improved up to 80%.Enterprises can tap the mountains of data they capture to foster new ways of decision making. For instance, the increasing availability of employee data in core IT applications is stimulating a fact-based approach to improve HR decisions.While the nature of applications of data varies according to enterprises, HR data is mainly being used to describe the state of HR metrics through simple statistical analysis; to construct statistical and machine learning models that lead to predictions and extract drivers that explain the phenomenon being modelled; and to deploy strategies to gauge the efficacy of the extant HR practice at enterprises.Drivers of HR analyticsBefore getting into the nuts and bolts of HR analytics solutions, we should perhaps acknowledge that data and human behaviour could work at cross purposesjust like oil and water. Besides, motivations that drive behaviour are intangiblethey cant be easily quantified.That said, one can get surprisingly better insights should one have access to longitudinal data. Having longer, time-series data, as it turns out, allows us to have a better stab at the problem. Since the data generation process continues as long as an employee remains in active engagement, access to data per se is not an issue. Moreover, statistical models are adept at identifying changes in employee behaviour over time.While there are certain HR problems that currently do not have a satisfactory solution within the existing management practices, HR departments can address many of the problems with data-led solutions.Profiling and segmentationSegmentation can be performed to isolate groups of employees with similar metrics. Identifying cohorts of similar employees reflects common performance drivers, characteristics and priorities. Each of these clusters can be explored with heat-maps and business metrics to derive the underlying narrative of the corresponding segments. The lessons derived from segmentation can be applied to effectively hire new employees and answer questions as to how long is an employee, on average, likely to stay.Performance predictionPerformance targets, especially for large enterprises and publicly-held companies, are so tightly intertwined with the broader stakeholder expectations that any misalignment or fall-back in performance can have considerable material implication. Prediction of the performance of front-line sales people is necessary for forecasting business throughput. Managers can use predictions in creative ways. For example, if the gap between performance and targets is expected to be large, other instruments such as advertisement and promotion or sales incentives can be introduced.AttritionEmployee churn is a fairly costly proposition for employers. Losing well-performing employees, acclimatised to the cultural moorings of the enterprise, is a concern. Also, higher employee churn invariably leads to escalation in costs in the form of new hiring, raising compensation levels, increased transactions and loss in productivity.Predictive models can assist not only in identifying those who are likely to quit but also when they might. Employees who score high on the performance index and high on churn probabilities are the obvious candidates for attrition intervention programmes. With statistical techniques such as Design of Experiments, the intervention programmes can be optimised to deliver lower employee churn. Offer rejectionGiven that filling a new position or a replacement invariably takes time, coupled with the waiting period between the offer acceptance and joining date, a dropout is bound to cost both time and money. This has a cascading impact especially in delivery-oriented or revenue-generating roles, and offer rejections can at times set back business plans. Predictive solutions can identify specific individual-level likelihood of a dropout, thus allowing the HR team to follow up with suitable actionsresulting in superior conversion rates.As technology and analytics occupy centre stage in business set-ups, firms slow in adopting technology and building analytics capabilities, risk lagging behind in the market place. The best firms see their employees not only as individuals but also as a rich source of collective data that can be used to make better talent decisions.Alok Shende is founder and director of Ascentius Insights.

-0.71,"Infosys Ltds December quarter results were in line with Street expectations, which isnt great news because expectations had been running low. Revenues fell 1.4% sequentially to $2.551 billion, largely due to the ramp-down of a large project with Royal Bank of Scotland Plc. (RBS) subsidiary Williams and Glyn.
				   
				While the trouble with the RBS project was already known, it turns out that revenues from some other large clients also fell meaningfully last quarter. Revenue from the top 10 clients fell as much as 9.1% sequentially. The RBS project is estimated to have accounted for about half of that decline, which means revenue from other large customers fell 4.5% sequentially.The company management played this down, saying this was due to the seasonal weakness that is typical of the December quarter. Customers take furloughs and have a lower number of working days at the end of a calendar year.But the companys guidance for the full year and the March quarter doesnt inspire much confidence either. According to analysts at Emkay Research, the annual guidance suggests revenue growth of 0.3-1.8% in the March quarter in constant currency terms, which is lower than the 1.9% sequential growth reported by the company in the corresponding period a year ago.ALSO READ | Infosys cuts full-year revenue guidance againThe company said certain pockets of headwinds and some client specific changes are responsible for the guidance, even though most of the verticals it operates in look set for a bounce-back. Analysts at Nomura Research said in a recent note to clients that improvement in demand for IT services could be lagged and likely to reflect only by 2QFY18. They added that the recovery is not uniform with the US banking and financial services (BFS) sector improving, and European BFS, telecom, retail and healthcare client financials showing soft trends, and that the policy uncertainty on immigration in US/regulation in BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) could keep momentum slow at the start of the year.Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services Ltds December quarter results and related commentary provide little reason for any optimism.

0.08,"Mumbai: Adding a fresh twist to the nearly two-month-old battle with Tata Sons Ltd, Cyrus P. Mistry on Monday announced his decision to not contest the forthcoming extraordinary general meetings (EGMs) and instead step down from the board of all the operating companies where he is a director.
ALSO READ | Cyrus Mistry cedes space to take moral high groundIn his first media interaction since the boardroom putsch that forced him to exit, Mistry said he is shifting gears and taking the fight with Tata Sons to a bigger platform, hinting, perhaps, at legal challenges to come. He said Tata Sonss coercive behaviour and uncertainty facing the shareholders had made him decide to quit. Edited excerpts:What prompted this decision to step down?I think the reason for the decision is wedded in the history of the Pallonji family, which has always supported the Tata group. What I have seen in the last eight weeks is a significant coercive behaviour from Tata Sons with employees and other stakeholders,  and as you see in their EGM notice, a threatening attitude, creating a situation of tremendous unease.My belief is that from here, the platform has to change to the legal side to ensure we protect the shareholders. The output is still the samewhat we are ensuring is governance reform and ensuring the ethical values of the founder... I will continue to pursue that very vigorously. What we have seen in the last eight weeks as far as the EGMs are concernedthe process has shown a lack of governance which I have detailed out. It has thrown up many ethical issues that have come to the fore. What we also saw in the last eight weeks is the huge amount of uncertainty, which I wanted to put to bed.What was the trigger for the move to step down?There was no trigger. One has to reflect from time to time. What we have achieved so far, is to initiate a dialogues for change and reform. What one would achieve by going ahead with the EGMs would be more destructive than productive.History shows that we have always looked at the best interest of the group. I believe the best interest of the group will be served by taking this to a new platform.What nextI cant discuss the legal strategy, but you will see it unfold.What would be the status of the EGM (of Indian Hotels) which was to take place tomorrow (Tuesday)?I think the EGM will be cancelled.What other steps will you take to ensure that all these governance reforms are carried out?We have brought the dialogue on the table, both from the point of view of governance and ethics, and I think that is today in peoples minds. I believe you will see shareholders in the near future demanding (better) governance.Have there been any instances that make you feel that some of this has already come to the fore?Yes, I think I will not go into the details of which one, but there have been instances of that.And I think also what is important was to first take me out of the equation because if I am in the equation, it gets clouded. I want to take myself out of the equation to make sure this is not a battle about me; this is effectively a battle for company governance reform. So by doing so, I have taken myself out of the position. I have been consistent if you see on the same thingin my EGM, in my representation.Again, I have reiterated this in my letter to the TCS (Tata Consultancy Services Ltd) shareholders. Many shareholders are ready to abstain to send a message to the company that this is not something that they wanted to do.Would Mr Wadias moves have had an impact?Mr Wadia has taken his own independent decision, and I think Mr Wadia might well continue with his position. His position is different from mine; his position is from an independent directors point of view, and, clearly, the fact that I am not contesting the EGM, strengthens his position because there is no question of him supporting me. I think he has always been for the institution of independent directors and thats the fight that he will continue I am sure.Whats the end game in terms of governance reforms that you want to achieve?I think from my perspective whats important is that the (Tata) Trusts themselves look at an appropriate governance structure, whether thats including succession planning, decision-making, and the interface with Tata Sons.ALSO READ | Tata Sons calls Cyrus Mistry resignation a deliberate strategyTata Sons itself at the board (level) has to reform and understand how it interacts with the Trusts and with the operating companies. And I think thats the part of the reform that needs to happen on the governance side.

				Bezoss Amazon.com Inc. and Indian rival Snapdeal, backed by Son, are spending billions of dollars to build e-commerce in India. Alibaba founder Ma has splurged on investments aimed at popularizing digital payments. Ambanis Reliance Industries Ltd is on track to spend about $30 billion (gulp!) to shake up Indias stodgy mobile internet service. Google, Tencent, Uber, Xiaomi, Apple and Facebook are also betting on growth in India.Its easy to see why India and its 1.3 billion people are the No. 1 prize in technology. About one-quarter of Indians used the internet in 2015, according to the most recently available data from the World Bank, but the percentage is expected to explode in coming years. And compared with Chinaa quick-to-digitize country that was quicksand for non-Chinese tech companiesIndia has been relatively open to companies from outside the country.The battle for supremacy is great for Indians, who will get better and cheaper technologies tailored to their needs. But gobs of money are being spent now for what is a very, very long game with an uncertain toll on both winners and losers.ALSO READ: Infosyss Rs13,000 crore payout falls short of what investors needApple CEO Tim Cook has said India is seven to 10 years behind China in technology market potential, and other executives echo that view. Building the future involves many, often low-tech, struggles like dealing with bad and clogged roads to deliver online orders, poor internet access for customers and dinged reputations from fears that foreign companies like Facebook are trying to monopolize internet use in the country. But a couple of recent actionsone by the government, the other by a billionairehave been important developments in Indias tech market. They show how individual actions can be unexpected sparks for technology use and the tech business in India. Spending by Indias richest person on a new mobile network: About $30 billion. First, the decision last year by Indias government to ban the vast majority of cash in circulation did more for adoption of digital payments than anything a rich techie could have done. That move helped payments services like Paytm, backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, but it also gives a leg up to on-demand ride companies, e-commerce and other services that depend on a shift toward electronic payments in a country with low credit card penetration. (Indias central bank on Thursday also cleared Amazon India to start its own digital payments service.) The second jolt was the launch last fall by Ambani, Indias richest person, of a national mobile network that offered free cellphone calls and cheap, fast mobile web surfing. Competitors complained, but they quickly cut customers bills, too, and gave them more data. Ambanis Reliance Jio mobile network signed up about 100 million customers. That is nearly as many customers on contracts with Verizon, the largest wireless company in the US by that measure. And Verizon didnt get those customers in six months, as Reliance Jio did.Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet Inc.,s Google, has said the biggest barrier to technology development in India is affordable, available and high-quality internet access, which like in China is mostly done on mobile phones. Ambani has helped bring down that internet access barrier. Technology development in India will be unpredictable and halting, but the potential payoff is too alluring to ignore.

-0.26,"Mumbai: The Tata group, in an affidavit filed to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) board, strongly refuted charges levelled by Cyrus P. Mistry, the ousted chairman of Tata Sons, and said Mistry did a poor job of turning around companies such as Tata Steel Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd, resulting in a drop in dividends to the Tata Trusts, The Economic Times reported on Monday, citing the affidavit. 
				   
				It also said Mistry did not pay any heed to Ratan Tatas requests to keep his family business at a distance to avoid conflict of interests.The affidavit is a response to the petition filed by Mistry on 20 December. In his petition Mistry alleged mismanagement and oppression of minority shareholders of Tata Sons and seeking the ouster of the current management of Tata Sons and Tata Trusts. Ratan Tata, in a handwritten letter dated 24 September 2013, seemed alarmed by the conflict of interests between Mistrys family business and Mistrys position as chairman and, therefore, prodded Mistry to set up a so called blind Trust that will disassociate the latter from his Tata shareholding, and also not to have any transaction of business between Shapoorji Pallonji Group and Tata Group as long as Mistry was its chairman. Blind Trust is a popular concept abroad when individuals are keen to avoid any conflicts with another entity their firm has a relationship with. It allows the owner of the stake to relinquish the control of the company during the period when he has other responsibilities. Tata preferred handwritten notes in his correspondence with Mistry, reflecting his desire to keep differences strictly confidential, between him and his then successor. Even as Mistry was removed as the chairman of the $103 billion group only on 24 October 2016, the differences between Mistry and the then chairman emeritus Ratan Tata had surfaced as early as 2013, according to the 37-page affidavit.

It is the trusts which hold a majority stake far exceeding that of Mistrys firms. Such inconsiderate allegations effectively degrade my lifelong contribution to the success story of the Tata Group, which began with Tata.The affidavit also provided a detailed account of why the board lost confidence in Mistrys ability to steer and lead. Tata said Mistry did little to resurrect companies such as Tata Motors. Further, dividends received by Tata Trusts declined.He said it was with a heavy heart that he came to terms with the fact that the group had faltered in their judgement when they chose Mistry as chairman.

-0.09,"Infosys Ltds chief operating officer U.B. Pravin Rao has warned investors of a bumpy ride in fiscal year 2017. According to him, there are some headwinds in the retail and healthcare business segments, which could lead to quarterly ups and downs in the firms performance.The two segments account for 22.5% of Infosyss revenues. Notwithstanding all this, the company has maintained its annual revenue growth forecast of 11.5-13.5%.
				   
				Investors were naturally disappointed. The chances of the company beating its revenue guidance are now slim. Infosys shares fell 4.6% after Raos comments became public. The moot question for investors in information technology (IT) services companies is whether the entire sectors performance will be choppy this year.According to Rao, Infosys is positioned well in the banking and financial services (BFS) vertical, where it has won large deals and has a strong pipeline.Analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a 7 June note to clients that the financial performance of US and European BFS firms has deteriorated sharply in the March quarter. Revenues of companies that are part of the Fortune 500 fell 10% from a year ago, while their operating profit fell 22%.The financial performance of clients in a sector is typically seen as a lead indicator for IT services demand. Data from the sector, which accounts for about 35% of revenues of Indian IT companies, suggests that FY17 could be a challenging year. Besides, macro data from the US has not been encouraging eitherprivate sector job additions are significantly lower, compared with year-ago levels and consumer confidence has declined.On the other hand, while Rao said that the performance of retail companies in the US has deteriorated and is the poorest in recent times, data collated by Nomura suggests otherwise. The broker said in its note that the performance of US Fortune 500 retail companies remains sluggish, although things havent worsened. To be sure, their revenues and profit were flat in the March quarter, more or less in line with the trend in the preceding quarters.Its likely that the set of clients that Infosys services are more troubled vis-a-vis the average performance of the sector. As such, the FY17 performance of companies will continue to be skewed, and will depend on the exposures that companies have to certain sectors and companies.But, overall, Infosyss latest comments are helpful as they bring in a reality check for some investors who were expecting Infosys to beat its revenue guidance.

US Citizenship and Immigration Services said employers seeking H-1B work visasa non-immigrant visa allowing American firms to employ foreign workersfor 2018 declined for the first time in five years.The surge in the number of applicants has been triggered by Trumps vows to protect jobs for locals. A Bloomberg report on Tuesday said Trump will take aim at information technology outsourcing companies when he orders a review of H-1B visa programmes to favour more skilled and highly paid applicants. The report also cited companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. and Mphasis Corp. as examples of outsourcing firms that would likely have fewer visas approved once the changes are adopted.

				Ford was selling the units for less than half what it paid to acquire them, just as early tremors of the credit crisis began sapping luxury demand. The day before the deal was announced on 3 January, 2008, West Texas Intermediate crude reached $100 a barrel for the first time, suggesting a tough environment for gas-guzzling sports cars and four-wheel drives.Tatas Nano, a super-cheap one lakh rupee ($1,500) minicar pitched at Indias emerging middle class, was seen as the best prospect, and Jaguar Land Rover looked like an expensive distraction. Moodys and S&P both downgraded Tata Motors, and the stock fell almost 30% in the six months it took to complete the transaction.How have those prognostications turned out?Wrong on almost every count. Jaguar Land Rover now accounts for more than half of Tata Motors unit sales, overtaking the trucks and passenger cars produced by Tata Motors India in the past two quarters, according to annual results released Monday.Helped by a weakening rupee, Jaguar Land Rovers British-pound-denominated sales have risen more than fivefold since the takeover to Rs.2.24 trillion ($33.3 billion) in the year through March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tata Motors Indias are up a relatively modest 74%.Jaguar Land Rover is also more profitable, even after one-time costs of £224 million ($329 million) during the fourth quarter related to Takatas airbags recall and damage from the 2015 Tianjin chemicals explosions. Operating margins averaged 11% over the past five years, versus 1% in the domestic business.Hows the much-hyped Tata Nano doing? Not so well. With sales rarely rising above 2,000 units a month, the Gujarat-based factory that was set up to build it is only running at about 10% capacity. Like the netbook computers that were launched around the same time and likewise failed to change the world, its entry-level pricing couldnt quite compensate for quality that was also a bit bargain basement.Tata Motors India is now focusing its attentions on the stronger mid- and high-cost vehicle segments, and has revamped the Nano with a Rs.1.99 lakh starting price. Spare capacity in the Gujarat plant will be used to make its new Tiago, which costs Rs.3.2 lakh and upwards.What should Ratan Tatas successor Cyrus Mistry do about this situation? One option sure to delight investors would be selling the legacy Tata business to focus entirely on Jaguar Land Rover, as canvassed by Gadflys Andy Mukherjee in March. The problem there is finding a buyer for an unprofitable arm thats also more indebted than its upmarket stablemate.A better idea would be to make the best of a bad job and work at applying lessons learned from the British business. As Nissan has shown since its 1999 alliance with Renault, troubled carmakers are often only a few blockbusting designs away from success. Many investors nowadays regard Tata Motors India as an irredeemable basket case thats lurched from one crisis to another for decades.

				In a special feature titled Man of Steel, the Sunday Times attributes the thousands of jobs saved in the industry largely to the sacking of Cyrus Mistry and Ratan Tata stepping in as interim chairman. Last weeks abrupt change of heart owes much to a terse board meeting in Mumbai on 24 October. At that meeting the board of Tata Sons, the parent company that sits astride an empire spanning steel to tea, sacked its chairman Cyrus Mistry and reinstated his predecessor Ratan Tata, the report said. Describing Ratan Tata as the architect of the £6.1-billion acquisition of Corus in 2007, it quotes insiders as saying that the 78-year-old tycoon was never comfortable with the idea of abandoning Tata Steels Welsh plant at Port Talbotthe UKs largest steelworks. Now he is back at the helm, Port Talbot has won a reprieve, it notes. Tata is said to have been painfully aware that the closure of Port Talbot would devastate the town already marred by poverty. As the head of the (Tata company) charity, Ratan is not like that. You dont want to get rid of vast chunks of people and create mass unemployment. Ratan was quite upset at the way he (Mistry) was dealing with Tata Steel.

Nearly 11,000 British workers at Tata Steel have been rejoicing after the company has indicated that it would not take any dividends from its British plants until their profit tops £200 million a year. The company made the pledge last week as part of a plan that will keep the Port Talbot site in south Wales open until at least 2021. It promised no job cuts for five years and to pump £1 billion into its UK plants over 10 years. Tata said in a statement, The immediate target of £200 million provides sufficient funds to invest in the business and to manage working capital needs. However, beyond this level the business will balance the needs of all its stakeholders, including the financing of dividends.

				VMware will deliver, sell and support a product that lets customers use their existing VMware software with access to Amazons cloud-based storage, database and analytic software, the companies said Thursday in a statement. Hybrid solutions allow customers to run applications on their own servers and through various remote cloud-based applications simultaneously.Called VMware Cloud on AWS, the product will be available in mid-2017. Pricing will be disclosed closer to the release, the companies said. It will appeal to companies that want the flexibility and capacity of managing data via the cloud.Amazon is trying to maintain its lead in the cloud-computing market over rivals Microsoft, Alphabet Inc.s Google and IBM as more companies transition from using their servers to renting computing power and data space hosted remotely, which they access via the Internet. Movie-service Netflix Inc. is a prominent example of a web company powered by Amazon Web Services.VMware is shifting its cloud strategy to focus on selling products that work with existing leaders, rather than trying to establish itself as an alternative to the Amazons of the world. As more companies run applications on rented servers over the Internet, providing services that link the different technologies customers use is a growing opportunity for VMware.Powerful partnershipThe alliance is a very powerful collaboration that gives companies flexibility in deciding whether to transition their data to the public cloud while maintaining investments theyve made in on-premise data centers, said Tim Feeney, an analyst at Morningstar Inc.Essentially, the process of managing the hybrid cloud environment is significantly less of a hassle now, Feeney said. This is a very powerful move for VMware because IT managers are more likely to retain VMwares services for longer.VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger said he sees hybrid solutions providing business opportunities for decades into the future while the on-premise data business slows.The Amazon partnership could be a blow to International Business Machines Corp., which has its own deal with VMware. IBM, however, said in a statement that 1,000 clients are already using the IBM cloud with software from VMware and the partnership has created significant momentum.Microsoft, responding to the Amazon-VMware agreement, said AWS is behind in offering hybrid cloud solutions.Microsoft Azure has always been hybrid by design, based on our decades of enterprise experience, the company said in the statement. True hybrid cloud isnt just connectivity, its consistencyacross development, management, and security.Global public cloud spending is expected to hit $204 billion this year, up 16.5% from a year ago, according to researcher Gartner Inc.

-0.88,"Bengaluru: Wipro chief executive officer Abidali Neemuchwala, who is based out of Dallas, US, could not fly down to Bengaluru when the company declared its second- quarter earnings last week because of a prior engagement. 
				   
				However, in a telephone interview with Mint, Neemuchwala said that Wipro is well-positioned and on its way to make itself a future-ready firm. The former Tata Consultancy Services Ltd veteran, who joined the company in April 2015 as the chief operating officer and took over as the CEO in February this year, has taken steps to improve Wipros delivery and sales capabilities. Edited excerpts: Due to slow growth and declining profitability, and the way technology is changing, many commentators and analysts have questioned the Indian IT outsourcing industry and are pronouncing the death of Indian IT. What are your thoughts? I would not agree with the death of Indian IT. Indian IT has always had the resilience or ability to transform itself. It has the flexibility, the nimble-footedness. One of our industrys core competencies has been our ability to train a large number of people. Now is the market changing? The answer is definitely yes. So what has made us successful in the pastis that going to make us successful in the future? The answer is certainly no. Will change be required? The answer is yes. Will Wipro be able to undergo that change? Absolutely yes. I am absolutely confident. Are we well-positioned as a company? The answer is yes. This is because I have always believed Wipro as a company is entrepreneurial. We are also very technology-centric. We have made investments in digital technologies, like Internet of Things and cloud. We are making the organisation simple and nimble-footed. We are democratising the operating structure where every single unit can run with that. We started hyper automation and now we are ahead of our plan. So going forward times for Wipro will be better than in the past and I wouldnt call it a doomsday scenario.Its now been over eight months and two full quarters with you as CEO. What has been, say, two heartening features for you as the boss and issues which have disappointed you, which you believe could have made your company do better?Two most heartening things which I have seen in the eight months are that our strategy and ambition resonates and percolates to employees and customers. This is very important for any CEO. Simply, because no single CEO can do magic in a company unless the CEO has the power of the organisation. And at the same time making employees believe that their future is tied to the future of the company. I am very glad that we have been able to do this and that is a very heartening thing for me. We had a very stable CEO transition (on 1 February Neemuchwala was appointed as CEO and his predecessor T.K. Kurien was appointed executive vice-chairman). We have a very stable top management team. The kind of changes we wanted to do at the top, we have been able to do without losing the senior leadership talent pool. The second thing is that as we started articulating our strategy, our customers are lapping up to this strategy. The newly-acquired and newly-built capabilities like Wipro Digital or Wipro Consulting or our hyper automation journey combined with Wipro Holmes, or our investments through Wipro ventures... we are able to take these capabilities to each one of our customers. On the other hand, the speed of change which is required and the speed of change a knowledge-based organisation can undergo is something which I would be happier if we could do it faster. Yes, we are an over 170,000-people-strong company. But the pace of change, the training, the way we are changing our processes, all of it I wish I could get done faster. Its not to say Im dissatisfied with the pace but it would be heartening if we could bring this change faster than what we are doing.Two-full quarters as CEO, and you have embarked on a journey by articulating six broad themes. Given these measures you have started, the management has said in the past that a complete turnaround will take time. Will it be fair to ask if the company can come back or say end March 2018 with industry-matching growth or Nasscom-projected growth numbers?Im always careful of putting a timeline and so I believe it is not unreasonable to expect this (by coming to industry-matching growth number by March 2018). I feel very confident and I see green shoots coming in a more sustainable manner. Im very hopeful that four-five quarters is a good time for a very visible outcome or metric for an industry-leading growth or margin.One of the things which is of concern now for many is that despite making three buyouts, with a combined revenue of $340 million, in the last financial year, and this fourth buyout of Appirio, Wipro is not able to record impressive growth. So on the merger and acquisition (M&A) front, how are you going to make sure Wipro is able to integrate buyouts well and scale up business?I think there are two parts. First is having a bold and risk taking ability to buy. And second is staying the course and making these acquisitions successful. We have shown that we certainly have the former. Now, its time to focus on the latter. So take for example, our acquisition of DesignIt (Wipro Ltd acquired Denmark-based DesignIt for $95 million in July last year). When we acquired it, we had 300 designers. Now we have 450 designers. That company on its own has never seen that kind of explosive growth. I feel very confident that we have the right balance where we dont give our buyouts such a tight embrace that we squeeze the company. We keep these buyouts in our shadow but not alone. I believe we have learnt from our past mistakes. Now HealthPlan Services (Wipro spent $460 million to buy HealthPlan Services in February this year) is a recent buyout but I do see very early synergy wins there. Although right now because of US elections and some issues in the Healthcare Payer market, there is a level of uncertainty. Cellent (Wipro paid $78 million in December last year to buy German firm Cellent) is taking a bit longer than the other two but that is because of cultural issues. Also, Im very focused that every business unit should not have more than one acquisition to integrate and digest. So Cellent is under manufacturing and Continental Europe. Appirio will sit with business applications. DesignIt sits with digital.These four buyouts bring over $550 million in revenue. So clearly M&A is going to play a big part of your ambitious target of becoming a $20 billion firm by 2020. What percentage of revenue do you expect to generate from M&A?We dont break out organic or inorganic revenue growth because it can be a bit misleading. But directionally, I can tell you that M&A will not be insignificant. It will be substantial and not small. The ticket size you are seeing is already bold from the Indian IT perspective. But we will not acquire to buy revenue or scale.",2016-10-24,u0swvRQUwz7X2V8n7hWWYN,"Indias IT sector has always had the resilience or ability to transform itself, says Abidali Neemuchwala ",competitor,10:45,IT sector not looking at doomsday scenario: Wipro CEO Abidali Neemuchwala  
-0.23,"Mumbai: Even as the crisis at Tata group deepens the role and responsibility of independent directors (IDs) have come to the forefront as they take varied stance in different operating companies, dividing the board and adding to the drama facing the $103 billion group.
				   
				In a note released on Monday, titled Tata-Mistry: Shareholders vs board, battle for supremacy, proxy advisory firm Stakeholders Empowerment Services (SES) prods the independent directors to explain to the stakeholders their divergent views to remove all doubts about the subsequent events that have unfolded since the boardroom coup on 24 October.It also questions the manner in which Mistry was removed from his position as a chairman from the TCS board. In a notification to the exchanges, on 10 November, TCS informed the decision to appoint Ishat Hussain as chairman on the Board of TCS in place of Mistry. SES does not agree that powers of Board or decisions of Board can be changed by shareholders in this manner.Among other things, the report highlights the conflicting stand of some of the independent directors. For instance, Keki Dadiseth, an independent director at Indian Hotels Co. Ltd (IHCL) who applauded the performance of Mistry, is also a trustee of Sir Ratan Tata Trust (SRTT). SRTT is one of the two principal Tata Trusts which control two thirds in Tata Sons, it is also a shareholder in IHCL. It seems like (Mr). Keki Dadiseth has taken two different stands, one where he supports (Mr) Mistry, other where he was also involved in decision making process for replacing (Mr) Mistry as a Trustee of SRTT. Same is true for Narsee Munjee.said the report. SES said unless they come out and state the reason for their diverse views, doubts would remain.On the issue of removal of Nusli Wadia, SES pointed out that while legally Tata Sons has every right to seek removal of any director on board, be it independent director, executive director or otherwise, the issue is whether such an act is ethically right and would pass the benchmark of good governance.SES said it believed the independent directors and all other directors on the board should be driven by interest of the shareholders. Directors (including IDs) do not have the mandate or right to adjudicate and pronounce right or wrong, it said. A divided board, said SES, is not in the interest of the stakeholders and the foundation of collective responsibility cannot survive in a divided board. A divided board is like a vehicle with driver at both ends, each trying to move in his own direction. Division at board level unlike dissent, which reflects a healthy board, is counterproductive and destroys shareholder value.It is in real sense a testing time for them, said the report, alluding to independent directors. It questions the basis on which the independent directors of Indian Hotels and Tata Chemicals Ltd decided to back Mistry. Do they know the truth? If yes, please tell the same to all investors? If not, can they adjudicate based on letters of two sides and decide? Does their job involve adjudication? Are they competent for adjudication? questioned the report. In one way, according to SES, they are guilty of the same hurried decision, which Mistry is complaining of. Adjudication is a process and one cannot decide without serious application of mind taking into account all factors. Have IDs done that? the report asked further.SES, the report pointed out, has been of the view that the action of removing Mistry on an immediate basis was disproportionate to the cause attributed for the decision. Assuming it was based on non-performance, it is difficult to believe that non-performance could be an overnight development which assumed such an enormity that immediate action was required, it said.Indian corporates materially differ from the rest of the developed countries, especially those in the US and the UK, in their ownership structure. In India, almost all companies have a dominant shareholder called promoter. In the US and the UK, holding/ownership is generally dispersed and no one is a promoter, pointed out SES. By equating dominant shareholders at par with minority shareholders, the law has created mismatch of risks and rights.

				Until about 2010, 70% of our revenue globally was from ERP. At the end of 2015, only about 30% of our revenue was from ERP and 70% was non-ERP, Deb Deep Sengupta, president and managing director, India subcontinent region, SAP, said in an interview.Sengupta acknowledged that while the benefits of ERP became visible in large enterprises, there was this perception that for a smaller company, SAPs technology is very hard to adopt and very expensive too. To address the issue, SAP India introduced many best practices from the implementations it had done in countries such as Brazil and Latin America. We created some packages for micro-verticals (small, specialized industry segments) and created an ecosystem of implementation partners that did not exist earlier, Sengupta said.SAP India also started working with agencies that do nation-building such as the railways, utility companies, ports and airports. We also worked a lot with the defence and home ministries, Sengupta added.In 2010, SAP launched its High-performance Analytic Appliance (HANA) software platform, which enables data processing in real or near-real time for quick business insights and improved decision-making. HANA can be deployed on premise or on the cloud, a model whereby firms do not spend upfront on licensing and equipment but pay on a per-use basis.SAP has also spent billions of dollars on acquiring firms whose solutions are cloud-centric. Some examples include Hybris, SuccessFactors, Ariba, Concur and Fieldglass. These, Sengupta said, have helped SAP rise to the world No. 2 spot in terms of revenue from cloud computing applications in 2015. Globally, we now have over 200 million users on the cloud.Even the core ERP, now christened S/4HANA has been completely re-tooled. In less than a year since its launch in 2015, we have deployed this solution in more than 2,700 companies. It is available on the cloud and on-premise. You can also deploy it in a hybrid model, Sengupta said.The 20.8-billion company, which has about 8,000 employees in India, does not give a break-up of its India revenue, but Dataquesta Cyber Media (India) Ltd publicationpegged the companys India revenue at Rs10,705 crore in fiscal 2015-16.SAP dominates the ERP software market in India; Dataquest reporting its market share at about 47%. Its product portfolio includes analytics, customer relationship management (CRM), expense management, human capital management and business-to-business commerce.The key verticals for SAP in India, according to Sengupta, are manufacturing, consumer goods, professional services and public services. Banking, financial services and insurance is another rapidly-growing vertical for the company, even though competitor Oracle Corp. leads in this space.For Sengupta, digital is not just about the front end; its an integrated thing. Its about the experience, which well provide. He observed that while digital firms are building an offline presence, physical ones are going digital too, known as the phygital trend. Sengupta cited the examples of US sportswear brand Under Armour and the multi-brand digital marketplace of the Tata group in India, Tata CLiQ, as examples of companies going phygital. To cater to this need, SAP announced the launch of the SAP Digital Boardroom in October 2015. According to Sengupta, the boardroom is a digital approach that aims to contextualize and simplify performance reporting across all areas of business in real time. Built on the SAP Cloud for Analytics Solution, the SAP Digital Boardroom incorporates fully automated business intelligence capabilities that aim to dramatically improve the quality and speed of reporting as well as collaboration in real time.SAP is also providing cutting-edge technology solutions to its clients. For instance, it has around 100 engineers working on machine learning, and that team is constantly expanding, said a 1 December 2016 report by research firm Market Realist. SAP is hoping to leverage machine learning to strengthen its cloud-based human resources suite SuccessFactors. Besides machine learning, SAP has also stepped up its investments to drive blockchain innovation. Blockchain is the technology that underlies cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Zcash.If SAP succeeds in its machine learning efforts, it could reduce competition for its products and pave the way for more revenue, the Market Realist report said. But it also cautioned that SAPs aggressive push into machine learning would put the firm on a collision course with Alphabet Inc. (parent of Google Inc.), which is also heavily into artificial intelligence research.The Internet of Things (IoT) is another area of focus for SAP; it announced an investment of 2 billion over five years in the IoT segment. As part of this plan, SAP acquired Plat.Onean IoT services providerlast September.To be sure, SAP will have its fair share of challenges in the coming years, especially in cloud computing, said analysts. For one, SAP does not have its own data centre in India yet. Sengupta pointed out that SAP is tying up with local partners for cloud services in India, but analysts remained sceptical.The growth has been easy for SAP in India when it came to the top 100 enterprises and then another 300-odd large companies, but the joy ride ends now, said Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst and CEO of Greyhound Research. He pointed out that Indian firms are wary about data residing in a foreign country. Gogia added that SAP has not found many takers for its expensive HANA. Though some enterprises have technically bought HANA licences, there are only a few of implementations in the country, as not all ERP modules are ready yet on HANA. Another reason for the lukewarm response to HANA is the lack of skill sets on HANA in India, Gogia noted.The upcoming goods and services tax (GST) regime, which would need ERP to be modified or upgraded for compliance, could also pose a challenge for SAP, Gogia said. While SAP is mandating its clients to buy S/4HANA licences if they want to migrate their existing SAP solution to a GST-compatible version, other vendors are offering to supply the GST patch for free, Gogia noted, warning that firms may shift their custom to other vendors as they embrace GST.The competition is undoubtedly stiff with the likes of Amazon Web Services (AWS), CenturyLink, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and Salesforce offering public cloud platforms. AWS and Microsoft lead the pack among global public cloud platform providers for enterprise developers. IBM and Google offer competitive options. Oracle, Salesforce, CenturyLink and SAP lag behind, according to a 29 August 2106 report by Forrester analysts Dave Bartoletti and John R. Rymer.Among the megacloud providers, SAP is a challenger, the report said. The analysts pointed out that while the HANA cloud platforms greatest strength is in shielding developers from all infrastructure configuration tasks when working with SAP business suites, companies must determine whether the platform is a good choice to also build and deploy applications that are independent of SAPs business suites since the HANA cloud platform offers only a limited set of application development and delivery functions. SAP, according to analysts, is yet to step up to the full range of language run times, databases, and analytics services of the leaders, although SAP recently released an IoT service to all customers. As a new entrant in the market, SAPs partner roster for HANA cloud platform is small, as is adoption of its platform, the report concluded.",2017-01-16,uLYxZE6K7ZZ85besrpDTIK,"SAP, the German ERP software company, has successfully made inroads into cloud computing and digital solutions",competitor,00:42,SAP: The road beyond ERP

				Take, for instance, NIIT Technologies Ltd. In the June quarter, the firm reported a 47.5% fall in net profit due to a provision of Rs36 crore for dues it was yet to receive on a government contract, which been put on hold. The companys India business declined 7.2% sequentially in the quarter to September because it earned lower revenue from the government. India now accounts for just 7% of its total revenue.It (India business) impacts cash flow because it is very difficult to collect money from the Indian government... by defocusing on Indian government, we have been able to dramatically reduce the outstandings that we have to the cash flow, said Arvind Thakur, chief executive officer of NIIT Technologies.Both the central and state governments have stepped up spending on IT and e-governance projects. Rigidities built into requests for proposals (RFPs), which dont take into account the complexities involved in project execution, and delays in clearing invoices have offset the attractiveness of contracts.Payment terms and conditions tend to be skewed towards the end of the contract period. The problem worsens in case the project has a significant hardware component that has to be delivered and installed early on in the project life cycle, according to lobby National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom).Delayed payments create serious cash flow challenges for industry, especially smaller and medium IT vendors, and can make projects financially unviable.Day sales outstanding last year was typically between 85-90 days because of all the money stuck in domestic government projects. This quarter, it is 73 days because we reduced dependence on government. So, the entire cash position has changed dramatically, Thakur said. Day sales outstanding  refers to the average number of days that a company takes to collect revenue after a sale has been made.Indias third largest IT firm Wipro Ltd in September threatened to initiate legal proceedings against the Employees State Insurance Corp. (ESIC), a government entity, due to non-payment of dues. The company entered into a seven-year contract in 2009 with ESIC as a system integrator to set up a health administration programme for Rs1,200 crore. Wipro has completed its obligations under the contract. However, ESIC has withheld certain amounts due to Wipro in an ad-hoc and arbitrary manner, which has resulted in significant delay in collections for Wipro, the company said in a filing to the BSE on 7 SeptemberWipro did not respond to emailed questions.

-1.0,"State-run refining and marketing companies (OMCs)Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL)have all delivered strong June quarter results. 
				   
				A key reason why these companies were able to perform better is the fact that they reported a better gross refining margin (GRM).For the quarter, the measure for IOC, HPCL and BPCL stood at $9.98 a barrel, $6.83 a barrel and $6.09 a barrel, respectively.GRM is a measure of profitability for refining companies. In general, GRMs of refining companies were expected to get a boost from inventory gains, thanks to the rising oil price trend over the quarter. That has panned out. Spark Capital Advisors (India) Pvt. Ltd says, adjusted for refining inventory gains, the GRMs for these companies were in the range of $4-5 a barrel. Thats not very impressive.Nevertheless, the results beat street expectations.IOCs operating profit increased by one-third, compared with the same period last year to Rs.13,683 crore. HPCLs operating profit increased 17% year-on-year to Rs.3,627 crore, while BPCLs operating profit increased at a much slower pace of 3% to Rs.3,919 crore.Reported net profit of IOC, HPCL and BPCL increased 25%, 30% and 11%, respectively, to Rs.8,269 crore, Rs.2,098 crore and Rs.2,620 crore.What next after a great quarter? Investors in these stocks have little to complain. Higher visibility on profits thanks to reforms in the sector, benefits from lower crude price and robust demand have helped sentiment. So far this year, shares of these companies have outperformed the Sensex meaningfully. Currently, BPCL, HPCL and IOC trade at 11 times, nine times and 10 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year.Even as valuations do not appear demanding, the outlook isnt the brightest. Spark Capital believes OMCs earnings have peaked out in fiscal 2016 and sees risks to 2HFY17/FY18E earnings. Some factors that pose risks, according to the brokerage, include weaker GRMs and narrowing of trade discounts offered by West Asian suppliershitting GRMs and normalization in marketing margins of auto fuels.Further, while the June quarter was supported by strong inventory gains, a similar support in the current quarter is unlikely. In fact, it is possible that the June quarter ends up being the best quarter for this year. Given this and the sharp run-up in the stocks, upsides in the OMC stocks could be capped.",2016-09-04,vwgz8rEb7fUq3xkuRqZFXK,"While the June quarter was supported by strong inventory gains, a similar support in the current quarter is unlikely, according to some analysts",competitor,20:18,Inventory gains boost oil marketing companies in June quarter
0.24,"Singapore: Japan Inc. is getting a raw deal in India. Some of its high-profile investments in the country have created more wealth for arbitration lawyers in London and Singapore than they have for shareholders. Those who were expecting great things from the bromance between Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi have reasons to be disappointed.
				   
				Two soured deals are NTT Docomo Inc.s $2.2 billion investment in an Indian wireless venture with the Tata Group, and the $4.6 billion Daiichi Sankyo Co. shelled out to buy Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd, a generic drugmaker. Almost a decade on, the Japanese companies have won claims to compensation via international arbitration proceedings, but in neither case is there any sign of a check in the mail.The Docomo dispute might be quicker to resolve. Ratan Tata, who recently reclaimed control of the conglomerate in a boardroom putsch, is reportedly keen to settle. It was he who had promised to buy out Docomo at a 50% loss on its original investment in five years.But when the Japanese tried to exercise their put option in 2014, the Indian group contended that in local law, a guaranteed exit price would become unwelcome foreign debt masquerading as equity, therefore, the Tatas could neither honour their commitment, nor fulfil the arbitration award the Japanese company won last year in London.ALSO READ: Tata-Mistry ties strained further with Tata Motors 2015 rights issue: AffidavitDaiichi Sankyos misery began when it acquired Ranbaxy from brothers Malvinder Singh and Shivinder Singh in 2008. Shortly after, US regulators barred more than 30 drugs made at two of the Indian companys plants and also halted reviews of new products at one of the factories because the company had falsified data. In May last year, the Singapore International Arbitration Centre awarded Daiichi a $376 million claim against the Singh brothers for suppressing facts, which had cost Ranbaxy an expensive settlement with the US regulator. Japan Inc.s total outbound mergers and acquisitions (M&A) last year stood at $79.7 billion.That victory doesnt mean much. The siblings are contending that the Singapore award is invalid under Indian law. Daiichi, which has already exited India at a loss, is now hoping the courts there will stop the Singh brothers from selling a stake in their hospital chain Fortis Healthcare Ltd before settling their claim. Earlier this month, Mint reported that KKR & Co. was in talks with the brothers to buy Fortis, which has an enterprise value of $1.5 billion. In a new twist, Daiichi claims it just found out that one of the Singh brothers investment companies it sued to recover the money from no longer exists.The longer such wrangles linger, the stronger the impression that Indias local laws make it impossible to settle commercial disputes with foreigners. Japanese firms arent the most ambitious of dealmakers in emerging markets anyway. Their total acquisitions in Brazil, Russia, India and China have amounted to just $25 billion over the past six years, of which Indias share has been $4.4 billion. By contrast, American companies spent $5.1 billion shopping in India last year.Abe wants the coyness to end and hopes for a big role in Indias railway modernization. However, for long-gestation infrastructure projects, sanctity of contract enforcement will be even more important. New Delhis tax regime is already a minefield. If Indian partners and the local law keep serving up unpalatable outcomes, then whatever appetite Japanese companies have could turn into a bellyache.

-0.55,"San Francisco: I built a chatbot. It can only do a handful of things, and its even dumber than the average chatbot. But it works, and I can talk to it through Facebook Messenger. More importantly, Im not a coder.
				   
				Some of the worlds largest technology companies are banking on a future where people will send text messages to airlines, banks, restaurants or stores and receive automated responses. Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corp., IBM and Tencent each held events this year centered around promoting their bot-related initiatives to software makers. Twitter Inc. introduced chatbot-like functions with Pizza Hut and other brands on Tuesday to field customer service inquiries.Many are betting these tools will soon be everywhere, with bot avatars for pop stars and mom-and-pop shops. (The band Kiss already has one.) For that bot-filled future to unfold, several startups are hoping to enable anyonenot just software developersto build a bot.The latest is Octane AI, which raised $1.5 million from General Catalyst and other investors. It joins Chatfuel, Olabot and Motion.ai, all of which have either raised money or rolled out their DIY-chatbot tools in the past year. They let people choose from a list of basic commands and edit scripted responses. Some generate revenue through subscriptions.The race among these startups heated up in April, when Facebook made chatbots available to Messengers billion-plus users. Facebook has said there are more than 30,000 chatbots available through its app. In September, Google bought Api.ai, a service that helps developers build bots.Making chatbots accessible to people who cant code is going to be a way a lot of businesses end up building their first few bots, said Phil Libin, a partner at General Catalyst. He compared these nascent bot-building tools with Squarespace Inc. or Wix.com Ltd., which make it easy to build a website.The chatbots you can create with these services are fairly rudimentary. If the bot sees a word or phrase it doesnt recognize or doesnt have an answer for, the conversation hits a dead end. To keep the chatter flowing, many chatbots act like an automated phone system: They nudge users to pick from a small set of responses, displayed as buttons. In most cases, you cant press 0 to get an operator.Its very important to set expectations, said Dmitry Dumik, whose company Chatfuel powers news-delivering chatbots for the New York Times and TechCrunch. You cant have a chatbot like in the movie Her.Octane co-founder Matt Schlicht is optimistic that bots will someday become more useful and benefit from advancements in artificial intelligence. When the iPhone first came out, we had things like the fart app, said Schlicht. Were in the fart app stage with bots.Schlichts startup is targeting brands with loyal followings for its chatbot builder. Octane recently teamed up with 50 Cent to answer messages sent to his Facebook page. The rappers bot can help fans do a few things, such as buying a G-Unit hat or signing up for updates from the musician. If you ask it a question it doesnt know how to answer, the bot simply replies: whats up fam.People message these Facebook pages all the time, and for the most part, no one responds, and the message goes into a black hole, said Schlicht. Its a huge missed opportunity.There are build-your-own chatbot tools that try to replicate dead people, and others that cater to the living. Olabot lets users create a bot version of themselves in minutes just by talking to it. The end result functions as a kind of social profile: Users can link their Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Medium and Spotify accounts, and then answer multiple-choice questions about their interests and views, such as, Would you rather talk about relationships or politics? The goal, according to Olabot CEO Esther Crawford: It should be as easy as creating an Instagram account. Bloomberg",2016-11-03,w1EyIubK0fuxqHzMXKumKP,Some of the worlds largest technology companies are betting on a chatbot future.

-1.0,"Have you seen sci-fi movies like A.I. Artificial Intelligence, a 2001 US science fiction drama directed by Steven Spielberg that portrays a childlike android programmed to love, or Bicentennial Man, which starred the late Robin Williams and was based on a 1976 novel by Isaac Asimov? Have you seen the movie Surrogates which starred Bruce Willis and portrayed a futuristic world where people live within the safety of their homes while their robotic surrogates carry on their daily chores?
				   
				If yes, you are also likely to believe that machines endowed with artificial intelligence (AI) can emulate, or even surpass, human intelligence. However, nothing can be further from the truth, say researchers. At least not till date.The frightening, futurist portrayals of artificial intelligence that dominate films and novels, and shape the popular imagination, are fictional Unlike in the movies, there is no race of superhuman robots on the horizon or probably even possible, insists a Stanford University-hosted report. Titled Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030, this year-long investigation is the first of a series of reports to be published at regular intervals as part of a 100-year study on AI. While the rate of progress in AI has been patchy and unpredictable, there have been significant advances since the fields inception 60 years ago In reality, AI is already changing our daily lives, almost entirely in ways that improve human health, safety, and productivity, the report added.AI has undoubtedly risen like a phoenix from the ashes of the so-called AI wintera period of time in the late 1970s and early 1980s when funding dwindled and research almost went underground. Peter Stone, a computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin and chair of the 17-member panel of international experts who wrote the Stanford report, says he and the panel believe that specialized AI applications will become both increasingly common and more useful by 2030, improving our economy and quality of life... But this technology will also create profound challenges, affecting jobs and incomes and other issues that we should begin addressing now to ensure that the benefits of AI are broadly shared.The Stanford report traces its roots to a 2009 study that brought AI scientists in a process of introspection that became ongoing in 2014, when Eric and Mary Horvitz created the AI100 endowment through Stanford. It investigates eight domains (see more at the end of this article) of human activity in which AI technologies are beginning to affect urban life in ways that will become increasingly pervasive and profound by 2030.Computer vision and AI planning, for example, drive the video games that are now a bigger entertainment industry than Hollywood, notes the report. Deep learning, a form of machine learning based on layered representations of variables referred to as neural networks, has made speech-understanding practical on our phones and in our kitchens, and its algorithms can be applied widely to an array of apps that rely on pattern recognition. Natural language processing, and knowledge representation and reasoning, according to the report, have enabled a machine to beat the Jeopardy champion and are bringing new power to Web searches.While impressive, these technologies are highly tailored to particular tasks. Each application typically requires years of specialized research and careful, unique construction. In similarly targeted apps, substantial increases in the future uses of AI technologies including more self-driving cars, healthcare diagnostics and targeted treatments, and physical assistance for care of elders can be expected.But what exactly is AI?Curiously, the lack of a precise, universally accepted definition of AI probably has helped the field to grow, blossom, and advance at an ever-accelerating pace, says the Stanford report.According to the study panel, Nils J. Nilsson has provided a useful definition: Artificial intelligence is that activity devoted to making machines intelligent, and intelligence is that quality that enables an entity to function appropriately and with foresight in its environment. Nilsson is Kumagai professor of engineering (emeritus) in the department of computer science at Stanford University and one of the founding researchers in the discipline of AI. The late John McCarthy, an American computer and cognitive scientist who coined the term AI in 1955, defined it as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.AI adopts an interdisciplinary approach. Other than computer science, AI also relies on subjects like math, psychology, linguistics, philosophy and neuroscience. Its growth has been triggered by the maturation of machine learning, stimulated in part by the rise of the digital economy, which both provides and leverages large amounts of data, according to the Stanford report. Other factors include the rise of cloud computing resources and consumer demand for widespread access to services such as speech recognition and navigation support.Machine learning has been propelled dramatically forward by impressive empirical successes of artificial neural networks, which can now be trained with huge data sets and large-scale computing. This approach has been come to be known as deep learning. The leap in the performance of information processing algorithms has been accompanied by significant progress in hardware technology for basic operations such as sensing, perception, and object recognition. New platforms and longer term, AI may be thought of as a radically different mechanism for wealth creation in which everyone should be entitled to a portion of the worlds AI-produced treasures, says the report.AI experts predict that intelligent and semi-intelligent autonomous systems such as self-driving cars and autonomous drones will march into our society in the next two-three years, according to a 6 February briefing at the 2016 American Association for the Advancement of Science Annual Meeting.To be sure, major research universities devote departments to AI studies, and technology companies already spend heavily to explore AI applications they regard as critical to their futures.On 28 September, for instance, Google Inc.-owned DeepMind Technologies Ltd, Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corp. and IBM Corp. said they will create a non-profit organization that will work to advance public understanding of AI technologies and formulate best practices on the challenges and opportunities within the field. Academics, non-profits, and specialists in policy and ethics will be invited to join the board of the organization, named the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society (Partnership on AI).The objective of the Partnership on AI is to address opportunities and challenges with AI technologies to benefit people and society. Besides conducting research, recommending best practices, and publishing research under an open licence in areas such as ethics, fairness and inclusivity; transparency, privacy and interoperability; collaboration between people and AI systems; and the trustworthiness, reliability and robustness of the technology, the organizations founding members will each contribute financial and research resources to the partnership and will share leadership with independent third-parties, including academics, user group advocates, and industry domain experts.On 29 September, Microsoft announced the formation of a new Microsoft AI and Research Group, bringing together over 5,000 computer scientists and engineers focused on the companys AI product efforts. The new group will be led by computer vision expert Harry Shum, a 20-year Microsoft veteran whose career has spanned leadership roles across Microsoft Research and Bing engineering. Several of Microsofts engineering leaders and teams will join the newly formed group, including those from the Information Platform, Cortana and Bing, and Ambient Computing and Robotics units. Effectively, the Microsoft AI and Research Group will encompass AI product engineering, basic and applied research labs, and New Experiences and Technologies.According to Satya Nadella, chief executive of Microsoft, this newly formed unit will help Microsoft focus on empowering both people and organizations, by democratizing access to intelligence to help solve our most pressing challenges, for which we are infusing AI into everything we deliver across our computing platforms and experiences.Microsoft is adopting a four-pronged approach to its initiative to democratize AI. The first involves harnessing AI to fundamentally change human and computer interaction through agents such as Microsofts digital personal assistant Cortana. The second is about infusing every appfrom the photo app on peoples phones to Skype and Office 365with intelligence.The third focuses on making these intelligent capabilities that are infused in Microsofts appscognitive capabilities such as vision and speech, and machine analyticsavailable to every app developer in the world. The fourth strategy revolves around building the worlds most powerful AI supercomputer with Azure and making it available to anyone, to enable people and organizations to harness its power.Facebook AI Research, according to a November 2015 note by Mike Schroepfer, chief technology officer at the social network firm, has been conducting ambitious research in areas like image recognition and natural language understanding with developments in a new technology called Memory Networks that add a type of short-term memory to the convolutional neural networks that power the deep-learning systems, allowing those systems to understand language more like a human would.In March,  DeepMinds computer programme, AlphaGo, beat Go champion Lee Seedol once again, triggering a deep-seated fear about the prowess of AI-driven bots. On the flip side, Microsofts AI chatbot Tay turned racist and sexist within 24 hours, forcing the company to issue an apology and take Tay offline. Microsoft, though, does have a chatbot called XiaoIce in China, which it claims is being used by about 40 million people.On 6 October, Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd announced it has agreed to acquire Viv Labs Inc., which has developed an AI platform that gives third-party developers the power to use and build conversational assistants and integrate a natural language-based interface into renowned apps and services. The deal underscores the companys penchant for virtual personal assistants and is part of its broader vision to deliver an AI-based open ecosystem across all its devices and services.Will AI machines surpass us?Such developments do give the impression that machines will soon become more intelligent than us. But we are not beaten yethuman skills are still superior in some areas, concludes a recent study by Danish physicist Jacob Sherson, published in science journal Nature. Sherson and his research group at Aarhus University, according to a 13 April statement, have identified one of the abilities that still makes humans unique compared to a computers enormous processing powerour skill in approaching problems heuristically and solving them intuitively.Technology luminaries such as Bill Gates, Elon Musk, even physicist Stephen Hawking, have expressed fear that robots with AI could rule mankind. But there are those who believe that AI machines can be controlled. Marvin Lee Minsky, who died in January, was an American cognitive scientist in the field of AI and co-founder of MITs AI laboratory. A champion of AI, he did believe that some computers would eventually become more intelligent than most human beings, but hoped that researchers would make such computers benevolent to mankind.On the other hand, Raymond Ray Kurzweil, an American author, computer scientist, inventor and futurist, in his 2006 book The Singularity is Near, predicted, among many other things, that AI will surpass humans, the smartest and most capable life forms on the planet. By 2099, he forecast that machines would have attained equal legal status with humans. However, Ray has sought to allay such fears that smart machines will dominate humans by pointing out that we can deploy strategies to keep emerging technologies like AI safe, and underscoring the existence of ethical guidelines like Isaac Asimovs three laws for robots, which can prevent at least to some extent smart machines from overpowering us (Should we fear AI?).So will these intelligent machines rule over humans?The answer to this question, however, is not easy because much will depend on how you approach, or address, the issue. The Stanford report concludes: Over the next several years, AI research, systems development, and social and regulatory frameworks will shape how the benefits of AI are weighed against its costs and risks, and how broadly these benefits are spread.What the Stanford AI report saysAutonomous cars, trucks and, possibly, aerial delivery vehicles may alter how we commute, work and shop, and create new patterns of life and leisure in cities.Home/service robots like robotic vacuum cleaners already in some homes and specialized robots will clean and provide security in living/work spaces. They will be equipped with sensors and remote controls.Healthcare devices to monitor personal health and robot-assisted surgery are hints of things to come if AI is developed in ways that gain the trust of doctors, nurses, patients and regulators.Interactive tutoring systems already help students learn languages, math and other skills. More is possible if technologies like natural language processing platforms develop to augment instruction by humans.The conjunction of content creation tools, social networks and AI will lead to new ways to gather, organize and deliver media in engaging, personalized and interactive ways.Investments in uplifting technologies like predictive models to prevent lead poisoning or improve food distribution could spread AI benefits to the underserved.Cameras, drones and software to analyse crime patterns should use AI in ways that reduce human bias and enhance safety without loss of liberty or dignity.Work should start now on how to help people adapt as the economy undergoes rapid changes as many existing jobs are lost and new ones are created.Source: Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030",2016-11-02,w2pku8z1u69nY9mVRp6rUM,Your fortnightly guide to how cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence will shape lives and businesses,competitor,01:29,"Artificial Intelligence is coming of age, slowly but surely"

Edited excerpts from an interview:What will be your focus area as the new CEO?One very important thing that we have articulated to the market is our Mode 123 strategy. This is all about how we can map the customer spend and fine-tune our services to make it relevant to the spend. We have mode 1 services which are traditional services such as infrastructure, application, engineering services and BPO (business process outsourcing). These are momentum services and we believe these markets are still under-served. Only 49% of global 2,000 companies have outsourced. Then still there are a lot of re-bid opportunities, $150 billion worth of re-bid is on and year on year its $40-50 billion. Its a big opportunity.You have made niche acquisitions such as those of Volvo for automotive and Butler America for aerospace. Are you more focused on gaining technology instead of acquiring customers?We want to focus on intellectual property (IP). If you want to future-proof your business, I think products and IPs are very important, so whether you can overnight build products and IPs of very high valueno. By this partnership and niche acquisitions, we will start building it in the long term. I think its really a very important strategy for us.Are you planning to appoint a new head of the infrastructure business, and will the COO position be filled?Its something I have to think about. Its too early. But we have a very strong leadershipsales leaders, delivery leaders and HCL has always boasted of strong leadership pipeline. I think, I am pretty comfortable with the momentum and we are pretty optimistic for the overall outlook.So, can I say that the COO position was created to help you transition to the CEO post?You can take it like that. It was a part of succession planning.You have chalked out a partnership with IBM. What gains are you expecting from this, considering that IBM is also a competitor?Competition is in certain space. In the IT space, there are lots of opportunities. They have a huge software business. So, there are good IPs that can be potentially looked at and thats what we have done. And then they are also a very large PaaS (platform-as-a-service) provider, like Bluemix is a big PaaS service. Some of our modern applications can be built on Microsoft Azure or IBM Bluemix.You have been defocusing on the India market. Will that continue?Yes, we are not focusing on the India market. It will continue to come down.With a 2.8% quarterly growth and a soft second half, will you be able to achieve the 12-14% target in 2016-17?We had a 6% revenue growth in the first quarter, we have 2.8% in the second quarter, so we are clear on what the run rate is. It is between 2% and 3% to get to the 12-14%. So far, from whatever we know, we feel confident to achieve that target.While many IT peers have hired outsiders in order to transform themselves, you are a 22-year company veteran. Do you feel confident to bring new ideas?Each core business has got very strong leadership. We continue to hire from outside also. So, it gives a good mix of external and internal view.

0.25,"Mumbai:  The Tata group fracas appears to have shed all earthly inhibitions and gone to a galaxy far, far away. In this Star Wars space opera, Cyrus Mistry, the recently ousted chairman, was Sith Lord Darth Vader who had brainwashed the PR folk  the old and venerable conglomerates noble Jedi warriors  and used them to smother criticism of his performance.
				   
				Thats probably why a 24 September Economist report, titled Mistrys Elephant, which was denounced by the group for drawing preconceived conclusions based on an inappropriate interpretation of selected data, was on Thursday extolled by the same people for being really a well-balanced and critical review.Not just that. Thursdays press statement ticked off the groups PR machineryin other words, itselffor dismissing views that did not toe the line being peddled by Bombay House, Tatas headquarters. Even the author of the Economist report is baffled by the sudden change of heart.Stanley Pignal @spignal Im fascinated to see Tata denouncing its own PR machines response to my recent article. Odd given PR side is/was https://t.co/gCbxA6z7EB Twitter: Stanley Pignal on TwitterAs for investors who have seen more than $12 billion of their Tata group wealth vanish since 24 October, the day Ratan Tata reclaimed control, only three questions really matter:Whos the Chosen One to restore balance to the Force? How many episodes are left? Wheres the popcorn?The answer to the first is far from obvious. Ratan Tatas camp is now accusing Mistry of trying to hijack control of operating companies in the $100 billion salt-to-software conglomerate. Mistrys side says the allegations are untrue. Tata is mocking Mistrys poor leadership for botching up Tata Steel Ltds UK operations, claiming that the Scunthorpe steel plant it sold in May to Greybull Capital LLP for 1 British pound has since seen a dramatic turnaround. Mistry, on the other hand, blames Ratan Tatas $12.9 billion purchase of Corus Group Plcs steel assets in 2007 for the groups debt overhang.Tata Consultancy share-price declined 13% since Ratan returned . Since Ratan Tata is back only in an interim capacity, the group needs a new chairman to end the spat. But until Mistry agrees to sell his familys 18.4% holding in Tata Sons Ltd., the holding company, the lightsabers wont get turned off. Its unlikely that the CEO of a global corporation would want to jump into the fray as Luke Skywalkerand get his or her reputation fried in the process. Besides, after Tata Groups press statement accused Mistry of dismantling structures put in place by visionary founders and generations of Tatas, its not even clear if the group wants to be anything other than a family-run enterprise.Its a much more than just a war of words. Ratan Tata is trying to evict Mistry from the boards of operating companies, but its proving to be far from easy thanks to a few independent directors whore supporting Mistry. But are those directors taking up the cudgels to uphold corporate governance standards, or are they simply trying to avoid the embarrassment of firing a chairman after showering praises on him?Like in everything else with the Tata Wars, its impossible to establish whos with the Force and whos gone over to the Dark Side. Or for that matter, how many more episodes are left in the sordid saga. The best investors can hope for is that until the group makes up its mind on whether it wants to slash debt, gun for growth, or do a bit of both, Tata Consultancy Services , the groups ATM, will keep coughing up more cash so Bombay House can fully engage in the tussle for control.

Since Neemuchwala joined the company in April last year, Wipro has spent $1.13 billion to buy four companies, including Appirio.Wipro spent $95 million in July 2015 to buy Denmark-based design firm Designit, with a revenue of $30 million, to give a boost to its newly created business division, Wipro Digital.In December, it paid $78 million to buy Cellent, a German technology company with over $90 million in revenue, that implements and maintains SAP software for clients in automobile and manufacturing segments. In February, Wipro paid $460 million to buy HealthPlan Services, a Florida, US-based technology firm that brings over $220 million in business by offering solutions to health insurance firms. Wipro also tried buying Viteos Group but later called off the buyout, citing inordinate delays in the completion of the acquisition. The Times of India first reported the Appirio deal.Wipros decision to buy Appirio mirrors the approach followed by its larger peers Accenture Plc. and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM). Accenture bought Salesforce partner, Cloud Sherpas in September last year while IBM bought Salesforce partner Bluewolf Group in April this year.This deal is about giving Wipro the capabilities to scale out IT services in the cloud world. What it gains are some strong methodologies in delivering in the cloud, and  significant partnerships such as Workday, Salesforce, Amazon, and Google, said Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm.More importantly, Wipro can take those methodologies and scale out to adjust for building revenue in the cloud. Every vendor is trying to figure out how to scale out cloud services and make money. Appirio and its chief competitor Blue Wolf have been the pioneers in this field.Cloud computing poses a threat to companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Wipro, whose customers  have started to use hosted servers. This means system integrators no longer just lose business in buying hardware and writing software needed for large data centres but even lose out in revenue which comes from maintaining the applications which move to hosted servers. The applications which moved to the hosted servers offered by Amazon and Microsoft use artificial intelligence and automation platform technologies which can be managed by  significantly fewer engineers.

It is also baseless and unsubstantiated. I have a fiduciary responsibility to act as an Independent director in the best interest of the companies on whose board I serve, no more or less. He further said, My independent stand has aggravated Tata Sons and my removal is being sought because I chose not to follow their diktat.

Underlining his actions as an independent director, Wadia recalled that he differed strongly with Ratan Tata in the acquisition of Corus but a decision was ultimately taken by consensus.Wadia further said he differed strongly providing continuous financial resources towards Tata Steel Europe from the year 2012 prior to Tata stepping down.

0.54,"The Tamil Nadu of the 1980s was a pioneer in the field of technical educationnot so much in terms of what was being taught, but where and how. That was the decade the state government decided to allow private engineering colleges. Tamil Nadu wasnt the only state to do so. Around the same time, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh also decided to allow private engineering colleges.
				   
				The motive for all states was the sameto address the demand-supply gap.This was particularly acute in Tamil Nadu, where 69% reservation meant anyone from the so-called forward castes, who wanted to be an engineer, had either the intelligence or the economic wherewithal, or both, to secure admission to a top government engineering college (The College of Engineering, Guindy, was at the top); an Indian Institute of Technology; College of Engineering Roorkee; BITS  Pilani; or the Regional Engineering College (REC), Trichy.ALSO READ | How N. Chandrasekaran became Tata Sons chairmanBy the middle of that decade, enough private engineering colleges had emerged. By then, young people wanting to be engineers in the state had discovered software services companies (or rather, software services companies had discovered them). The demand for computer science soared among students seeking admission to engineering colleges.Even with the increase in supply, there still wasnt enough to go around. Companies such as NIIT Ltd and Aptech Ltd thrived on the surplus and also on demand from science (even commerce and arts) graduates who wanted to do computers, so as to land a job with a software services company. Loath to be left behind, government universities and private colleges decided to offer a masters programme in computer applications, called MCA. The main objective was to target graduates in other disciplines who would otherwise end up with a private computer education institute.N. Chandrasekaran, who was named chairman of Tata Sons on 12 January, was a beneficiary of this. He joined Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) after completing his MCA from REC Trichy.That was in 1987, by when Chennai had already emerged as home to one of TCSs biggest development centres (on what the city still obstinately called Cathedral Road, although the government had long ago renamed it Dr Radhakrishnan Road after one of the countrys presidents). Interestingly, the TCS office was almost strategically locatedright next to the US consulate. Back then, anyone who joined TCS wanted to be sent to the US on an assignment. Many succeeded. Chennai was well on its way to becoming a city of parents. But thats another story.ALSO READ | Tata Sons new chairman has twin obstaclesa family and a conglomerateChandrasekaran isnt from Chennai. He was born in Mohanur in Namakkal district (famous for poultry farms) and studied in a local Tamil medium school till Class X. Although he didnt go to engineering college (he graduated in applied sciences from Coimbatore), he must have been aware of what was happening around him (and also from his two elder brothers, N. Srinivasan and N. Ganapathy Subramaniam). Back in the 1980s, it was hard to be a student in Tamil Nadu and not get caught up in the whole computer thing. And when Chandrasekaran completed his MCA from REC Trichy, he went to work in TCSs Cathedral Road office. Interestingly, his brother N. Ganapathy Subramaniam was already working for TCS then (and still does).Sure, Chandrasekarans career really took off after he served as then chief executive S. Ramadorais executive assistant for a couple of years in the late 1990s, but it would be unfair to ignore the other factors that have contributed to his success: his own abilities; an environment that encouraged computer literacy (actually, proficiency); colleges that offered the right kind of courses; and the deeply meritocratic nature of the IT industry.Interestingly, Chandrasekaran wasnt the only beneficiary of this. Nor were all the beneficiaries Tamilian Brahmins (or tam-brahms for short; Chandrasekaran is one), although that was the community at the vanguard of the first great westward migration by Indian IT professionals. In pre-dominantly Brahmin parts of Chennai, such as T. Nagar and Adyar and Mylapore, the joke in the 1980s (and the early 1990s) was that every family had to give at least one child to Uncle Sam.ALSO READ | The many challenges of Natarajan ChandrasekaranThanks to the 69% reservation and the increase in both demand for and supply of software engineers, almost everyone benefited. Thanks to IT, Tamil Nadus affirmative action actually worked, perhaps one reason why the states social indicators are healthy.In the mid-1980s Tamil Nadu (and Chennai, which was still Madras), it was clear that if one wanted a job one should do computers.And through the 1990s, the 2000s, and perhaps the 2010s (although the last is arguable), it was clear that IT companies were among the best managed in the country. They had to be. Their clients were usually Western corporations with high benchmarks, and their success meant they were tracked extensivelysometimes obsessivelyby analysts.It is, therefore, in the fitness of things that a young man from Mohanur who did computers and then worked in an IT company, gets a shot at managing one of the largest conglomerates in the land.Chandrasekarans success is that of the Indian IT Everymans.R.

-0.82,"Bengaluru: At Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), the protracted period of subpar growth continued as Indias largest technology outsourcing firm reported a 0.3% dollar revenue growth, marginally higher than Street expectations, in the October-December period.
				   
				TCS, which ended with $16.5 billion in revenue last year, has grown more than 3% on a sequential basis in a quarter only three times since October 2014. Worryingly, over these past nine quarters, it last reported an over 10% year-on-year growth only once, in the January-March 2015 period.Mumbai-based TCS saw a 0.3% rise in dollar revenue from the preceding three months, and was up 5.8% from the year-ago period to $4.379 billion in the quarter to December. In rupee terms, third-quarter revenue rose 1.5% to Rs29,735 crore from the preceding three months. In constant currency terms, TCS reported a 2% growth, on account of generating more business from its banking clients in the US.TCSs quarterly profit rose 1.6% sequentially to $1 billion, up 8% from $926 million in the year-ago period.A Bloomberg survey of analysts had estimated the firm to report Rs6,432 crore ($947.49 million) profit on net sales of 29610.5 crore ($4.36 billion).The companys operating margin was 26%, similar to what it was at the end of the July-September period. The management reiterated its commitment to end the year in its stated guidance of 26-28% operating margin.It was a very good quarter, considering traditionally Q3 has a weak demand, said Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chief executive officer, TCS, who is set to take over as chairman of holding company Tata Sons on 21 February. I dont expect Q4 to be anything different than in the past. As of now, based on what information I have, I believe it (Q4) should be on expected lines.Chandrasekaran downplayed concerns over a clamp down on H-1B visas, critical to software firms such as TCS, in the context of the new administration in the US and said the company is well prepared to cope with any increase in wages for its US employees or a lowering of the visa ceiling.I cannot comment on the margin impact; but since 2015, we have been preparing ourselves to work in a visa-constrained environment. So I dont think there will be any impact on us, said Chandrasekaran. Earlier this month, a legislation demanding that outsourcing firms pay at least $100,000 a year to employees who work in the US was introduced in the US Congress.TCS does not give a quarterly or yearly guidance, and the companys underperformance in the nine months of the current year means it will at-best report a 6% dollar revenue growth, lower than the 7.1% growth reported last year.TCS has added $786 million in incremental revenue from April to December this year against $783 million in new business in the first nine months of 2015-16. Significantly, for the first time since TCS went public in 2004, its annual growth will be less than or at best on par with Accenture Plc., which is double the size of the Mumbai-based firm. Accenture grew 6% in the year to August last year (Accenture follows September-August as financial year), helped by  15 acquisitions , which brought 2 percentage points of overall 10.5% constant currency growth. TCS has shied away from buying companies.It is status quonothing materially different than the second quarter. It is important to note that expectations are already so low that even if the company meets the low end of these expectations, it is considered to be a decent show, said a Mumbai-based analyst at a domestic brokerage, on condition of anonymity.At the heart of TCSs underperformance is its inability to build a stronger consulting practice and the managements reluctance to buy small hi-tech firms. TCS also faces some client-specific challenges. Nonetheless, TCS said its digital business in the third quarter rose 6.6% on a sequential basis and 30.2% over the year-ago period to $737 million, or 16.8% of its quarterly revenue.Its revenue from banking, financial services and insurance firms, which accounts for 40% of total revenue, reported a 2.1% increase in constant currency terms. TCS reported a 2.2% improvement in the US, which accounts for 55% of total revenue. Revenue growth in the UK, which brings about 13.3% of total business, rose 1.7%, while the India business, which brings about 6.3% of revenue, jumped 10.3%.TCS managed to retain more employees in the quarter, as attrition for IT services stood at 11.3% and including back office unit (BPO business), attrition was 12.2%.

				The dynastic business that built a reputation over more than a century for discretion, integrity and fair-dealing has sunk into a public spat of allegations and name-calling. Its directors trade barbs. Its share price is tumbling. And on Friday, executives were jostled in the street while security staff engaged in an unseemly brawl outside Bombay House, the groups revered headquarters.How did it come to this?The drama dissecting Tata Sons, Indias largest industrial group, revolves around Ratan Tata, scion of a family that built an empire so diverse that it writes financial software for Goldman Sachs Group Inc., sells pick-up trucks in Uganda and offers packaged salt to Indian families at Rs.18 a kilo.Two weeks ago, Ratan Tata threw the group into confusion and the public spotlight after the Tata Sons board sacked his successor as chairman, Cyrus Mistry, and wrested back control for the 78-year-old. Neither Tata nor any other board member or major investor has suggested that Mistry financially mismanaged the group. He remains head of many of the affiliate companies, such as Tata Motors and Tata Steel.Instead, Mistrys ouster was the result of growing discontent from Tata, who ran the company for two decades, at what he considered was an undermining of the Tata brand, according to people who have worked with both and asked not to be named because the matter is private.Egos have been bruised, said Harsh Goenka, chairman of RPG Group, another Mumbai-based conglomerate. He said the Tata name stands for humility, humaneness, benevolence, grace and boldness of vision, and it has been dented by the current conflict.Since Mistrys removal as group chairman, Tatas more than two dozen listed companies have lost in excess of $8 billion in market value. Ratan Tata didnt respond to a recent request for an interview.Brand TataTatas adherence to the idea of the brand being a byword for integrity has run throughout his career, according to interviews with more than a dozen people who have worked with him. Banks would routinely do business based on Tatas word, and once he committed to doing something, he would see it through no matter what, said a person with knowledge of some of his deals.When Tata Steel bid for Corus Plc in 2006, it arranged financing with three banks for around $5 billion to $6 billion, said the person, who asked not to be named because the negotiations were private. As the price rose in a bidding war for the European steelmaker, Tata officials found cheaper funding, but would have to pay a break fee with the original banks of about £80 million ($99 million). Some executives tried to negotiate a cheaper release, but when the matter was brought to the attention of Ratan Tata, he insisted the original contract be honoured, the person said.Tatas decision echoes the groups current spat with Japanese telecommunication partner NTT Docomo Inc., which is one of the key battlegrounds in the war of words between Tata and Mistry. Docomo is trying to enforce a London Court of International Arbitration decision ordering Tata Sons to pay $1.17 billion for failing to uphold a contract, signed during Ratan Tatas 21-year period at the helm.A Tata Sons spokesman declined to comment while Mistrys office referred to a 1 November statement on the companys partnership with NTT Docomo.Tata became frustrated at Mistrys seeming reluctance to pay, which reflected on the Tata name, according to people familiar with the case. In an email to the directors after his removal, Mistry said it was the board that has not covered itself with glory, by the way he was dismissed.Family codeBut the Tata family code, rigorously pursued by Ratan Tatas predecessor, the legendary industrialist, aviator and philanthropist J.R.D. Tata, extends far beyond just sticking to your word.J.R.D., whose portrait looked down from the boardroom wall in Bombay House as Mistry was being ousted, made Tata famous for refusing to pay bribes. He founded many of the businesses that are now key units, such as Tata Motors, and funnelled a large chunk of profits to social programs such as Asias first cancer hospital and the Tata Institute for Social Sciences.He handpicked Ratan, the great grandson via his adopted father of group founder Jamsetji Tata, to carry on that family legacy. Trained as an architect at Cornell University, Ratan began on the shop floor in 1962, stoking Tata Steels blast furnaces, before gaining experience in several positions in the group.In 1991, he took over the chairmanship and set about establishing his dominance over group companies, which had become rich and autonomous during J.R.D.s five-decade reign.In the 1990s the Tata Group was ruled by powerful satraps and he very dexterously distanced all of them from their powerful positions and gained total control, said Goenka, chairman of RPG. The one common factor that defines Ratan Tata then and now is that of an astute leader. He eased out Cyrus Mistry from the chairmanship that took India Inc. completely by surprise. If the past was about a loud war cry, the present is about stealth.During his first chairmanship, Tata expanded the company rapidly, often by acquisition, turning a predominately India business into a global group with $103 billion in salesahead of Gazprom and International Business Machines Corp. He also sowed the seeds for many of the groups current troubles, including the purchase of Corus, the venture with Docomo and the ill-fated Nano car project.Since about 2004, with the question of his succession looming, Tata gradually increased his control in the operations of the group, said a person who worked closely with both Mistry and Tata. He took major decisions with less board consultation than previously, the person said.Ratan Tata has always consulted senior executives in all his decisions, including the Corus acquisition, said a Tata official, who asked not to be identified citing company rules.New successorThe eventual choice for a successor was Mistry, the son of one of the biggest shareholders in Tata Sons, his own brother-in-law and a fellow member of the Parsi communitythe isolated followers of Zoroastrianism whose ancestors fled to India from Persia a millennium ago.With Mistry deposed, Tata is back at the helm promising to find a new successor before March. Next month he will be 79.I do not think Ratan Tata has any option other than to hold on to the position that he has taken back, whether he likes it or not, said Kavil Ramachandran, executive director of the Thomas Schmidheiny Centre for Family Enterprise at the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad. In the interest of every stakeholder, he has to take steps to get the situation back on track.While Ratan took the groups products to more than 100 countries, he retained the ethos of his predecessors, that in building a business you are also helping to build India.Nano InspirationThe Nano was inspired by seeing an Indian family riding on a motorbike in the rain. It epitomized Ratan Tatas qualitieshis vision and attention to detail, as well as his stubbornness and reluctance to terminate a key business thats losing money.Tata spent hours with the Nano development team, focusing on getting every detail right for the most anticipated auto release of 2008, said a person who worked on the project. Yet the car was marketed as cheap, a stigma that was reinforced by dealers who had little interest in pushing a low-margin vehicle.When Mistry led the introduction of Tata Motors latest modelthe unfortunately named Zica hatchback, rechristened Tiagohis main concern was how to ensure the car would be profitable, according to the person who worked with both Mistry and Tata, and asked not to be identified as hes not authorized to speak to the media. Mistry talked to staff about what he, and even his children, thought of the marketing campaign and what needed fixing, the employee said.Ratan Tatas vision for the group was a globally diversified and successful conglomerate with some distinctive values, said Rishikesha T. Krishnan, director and professor of strategic management at the Indian Institute of Management Indore. Cyrus Mistry did not dismantle that vision, but he appears to have been particularly concerned about the viability of different businesses.If something went wrong, Tata would tell you to your face and then take immediate steps to rectify the problem, said a senior Tata Sons executive who has known Ratan Tata for more than two decades. He described Tata as a humanist with a deep sense of compassion, who was keen on products that fostered social justice like the Nano, or Tata Salt.In 2012, after grooming Mistry for the top job for a year, Tata stepped down as group chairman, and moved from his relatively modest apartment to a white, three-story house he built on the seafront near the exclusive Colaba neighbourhood of Mumbai, with a private gym and rooftop infinity pool looking out over the Arabian Sea, according to local newspaper reports.Start-up InvestingHe threw his energies into working with entrepreneurs, investing nominal sums in more than three dozen startups ranging from artificial intelligence to online sales of womens lingerie.Those who met him spoke of his imposing presence, graciousness and attention to detail in how ideas would work.Mr Tata. listens intently, has a curiosity to learn and often gives a fresh perspective that hasnt been considered, said Vani Kola, head of venture capital fund Kalaari Capital. He notices the smallest things, he puts people at ease.At the same time, he continued to keep any eye on the Tata Group as head of the powerful family trusts that hold a majority stake in Tata Sons. According to several people who know Tata, he became increasingly frustrated by what was happening to the company that bore his name.On 24 October, before the board meeting in Bombay House, where stray dogs are allowed to roam the corridors, Mistry was told of the decision to remove him.Cyrus Mistry was handpicked by Ratan Tata, said Goenka. This time he will look for someone who understands the Tata culture and the Tata way of doing things, better. Bloomberg",2016-11-08,ylJCy9morUM9QsY5DRkqhN,"Tata group, the dynastic business that built a reputation over more than a century for discretion, integrity and fair-dealing has sunk into a public spat of allegations and name-calling",company,11:24,Ratan Tatas return as interim chairman seen taking toll on Brand Tata

Finance minister Arun Jaitley says the government aims to create an integrated public sector oil major to match the might of the international oil and gas giants. The big question is how that plan will unfold. Details are beginning to emerge.
				   
				Whats the logic?The government owns majority stakes in eight major listed oil and gas firms. Combining some or all would create a bigger corporation with clout to negotiate better deals, for instance, on crude oil purchases. India imports some 80% of its crude needs. A merged business would also be less vulnerable to the vagaries of oil prices, say, by combining producers (which benefit from higher prices) with refiners (which get a boost from lower prices).Just how big are those eight state-owned companies?Their combined market value is almost $109 billion. If folded into one company, that would rank seventh globally among oil and gas majors. (Exxon Mobil is No. 1 at $345 billion). Such an entity would outstrip Indias private oil giant, Reliance Industries, whose market value is $71 billion. Six smaller unlisted joint-venture oil and gas companies may also come into play.What do we know about the governments plan?Not much, in terms of detail. In August, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said his ministry was open to discussing a merger to create a larger, stronger national oil company and that the government was figuring out the appropriate model for the combination. Jaitley then spoke in mostly general terms during his 2 February budget speech, about strengthening public-sector enterprises through consolidation, mergers and acquisitions.Where are we now?According to the Economic Times, the oil ministry, which administers the industry and works independently of the finance ministry, held a meeting in March with the state-run oil companies and asked them to produce a road map for integration. So far, that road map appears to entail Oil & Natural Gas Corp. purchasing the governments stake in either Hindustan Petroleum Corp., worth $4 billion, or Bharat Petroleum Corp., worth $7.7 billion.How would that work?Surprisingly simply. ONGC could just buy shares from the government and keep the refiner as a separate subsidiary, obviating the need for an official merger. ONGC already has a refining subsidiary -- adding HPCL or BPCL would create the nations third-largest refiner. India would receive vital funds for reducing the countrys fiscal deficit, but the move would imperil Prime Minister Narendra Modis goal of cutting crude imports, since ONGC might need to divert spending from its exploration investments aimed at boosting oil and gas output.Is there a precedent?The government attempted something similar at least once in the oil sector, during the mid-2000s. Those efforts unraveled through opposition from some of the companies and employees. The newly proposed mergers deals would also need to surmount the enormous challenge of absorbing refiners with networks across 29 states, thousands of employees and unique work cultures.What about beyond the energy world?Air India has remained unprofitable since its 2007 merger with Indian Airlines, though it managed to reduce losses this year. The government has struggled to integrate the carriers, failed to achieve the expected synergies and faced labour issues. What does the market think?Shares of all but one of the five largest state oil companies fell in the two months after the February budget, even as Indias benchmark stock index surged.A 2015 study by the Journal of Business Management and Economics concluded that while mergers in Indias energy sector may not create immediate shareholder value, they produce companies that are better placed to compete and adapt. Credit ratings company Fitch reached a similar conclusion.",2017-04-12,z96kysgijGEwzxkC30psNM,The government owns majority stakes in eight  listed oil and gas firms.

0.85,"San Francisco: Microsoft Corp.s effort to halt the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) so-called sneak-and-peak searches of e-mails may ride on whether its allowed to defend its customers constitutional rights.
				   
				The judge who will decide whether the case can go ahead told the companys lawyers to be ready in court Monday to address earlier rulings that undercut their arguments. At stake is half of Microsofts case to block the US from secretly accessing customer data stored in the cloud, including e-mail.Microsoft drew support from tech leaders including Apple Inc., Google and Amazon.com Inc. when it sued the US justice department in April. They say the very future of mobile and cloud computing is at risk if customers cant trust that their data will remain private. The federal law allowing searches goes far beyond any necessary limits and infringes users Fourth Amendment rights against unlawful search and seizure, they contend.The justice department argues it needs such digital tools to help fight increasingly sophisticated criminals and terrorists who are savvy at using technology to communicate and hide their tracks. Disclosing the searches would undermine investigations and put Americans at risk, they argue. A decision for the US would give an early victory to President Donald Trump, who said during his campaign that he would compel technology companies to cooperate.ALSO READ: IBM touts Donald Trump-pleasing hiring plans while firing thousandsThe case may never reach that point unless Microsoft wins the argument that it has the ability to sueor standingto protect customer privacy.Rights-case barrierStanding has been a barrier in cases that seek to vindicate peoples privacy rights, said Jennifer Granick, a Stanford Law School professor. Its a serious issue in conducting constitutional litigation, and this case is no different.Four court decisions listed by US district judge James Robart in Seattle all reached the same conclusionFourth Amendment protections can only be cited by individuals, and not vicariously by third parties. The most recent was a 2014 US Supreme Court ruling that the family of a driver who was shot and killed by police after a high-speed chase couldnt invoke that right on his behalf related to a lawsuit over his death.Microsofts lawyers may have anticipated the Fourth Amendment challenge in their complaint, stating that the governments silent searches of user data have directly injured it by eroding the customer trust in the company.The industrys push against government intrusion into customers private information began in the wake of Edward Snowdens 2013 disclosures about covert data collection that put them all on the defensive.Microsoft said when it filed its lawsuit that federal courts had issued almost 2,600 secrecy orders barring it from disclosing government warrants for access to private e-mail accounts. It said more than two-thirds of those orders have no fixed end date, meaning the company can never tell customers about them, even after an investigation is completed.Free speechThe Redmond, Washington-based company concedes there may be times when the government is justified in seeking a gag order to prevent customers under investigation from tampering with evidence or harming another person. Still, the statute is too broad and sets too low of a standard for secrecy, Microsoft contends, arguing regarding the other half of its case that its own free-speech rights are being violated by the orders.ALSO READ: Donald Trump said to sign executive order on Trans-Pacific PactThe Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy group supporting Microsoft in the case, fears a ruling that the company cant sue could mean no one will ever have the right to file a data privacy lawsuit under the Fourth Amendment. The people whose privacy might be violated will never find out about the searches, said Andrew Crocker, a lawyer for the group.We obviously think that providers should be able to raise the rights of their customers, Crocker said. Otherwise youre cutting customers out of the equation when the government comes to companies with these secret gag orders.The case is Microsoft Corp. vs US department of justice, 16-cv-00538, US District Court, Western District of Washington (Seattle).

-1.0,"Tech Mahindra Ltd has made another acquisition with the aim to cross-sell its services to a new set of clients. It said on Monday it has acquired CJS Solutions Group Llc, a US-based healthcare information technology consulting firm that does business as the HCI Group.
				   
				The enterprise value of $110 million seems reasonable, given HCIs trailing 12-month revenue of $114 million. Besides, the US-based firm has grown by as much as 28% annually in the past two years. Of course, operating margin is low at high single-digit levels, but this is typical of US-based tech firms. And it seems unlikely that Tech Mahindra can bring about a meaningful improvement in margins, considering that HCIs work is mostly done on site.Analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note to clients, We believe that the nature of work that HCI does in the US provides limited opportunity for offshorability. While some margin benefits might still be realized on the back of cost cutting and other efficiencies, the major benefit due to offshoring will not materialize.The big idea behind the acquisition then appears to be the ability to cross-sell Tech Mahindras services to a new set of clients. The company has almost no exposure to the healthcare provider space, and the acquisition will give access to 30 new clients. Overall, the healthcare and life sciences vertical contributes less than 5% to its revenues. Jefferies analysts point out that the acquisition is on the same lines as two previous acquisitions in 2016Target and Bio Agencywhere a specific expertise was acquired with the cross-sell of existing services being the major incremental positive.Alongside the companys penchant for mergers and acquisitions, the performance of its organic business has also picked up in the past two quarters. In turn, this has got investors excited. Since it announced Q2 results in end-October, Tech Mahindras shares have risen by around 20%, far higher than the 7% gain in the Nifty IT index.In the process, its valuations have risen to 15.6 times estimated fiscal year 2017 earnings, only slightly lower than Infosys Ltds 16.2 times valuation. While the better-than-expected growth in the past quarters suggests Tech Mahindra is firmly on the recovery path, not everyone is convinced. Analysts at Nomura Research said in a note to clients, We see the telecom (~47% of revenues) segment to be stable but not in a material rebound scenario, with likely near-term headwinds from LCC (Lightbridge Communications Corp.) restructuring and non-recurrence of milestone payments (which aided growth in Q3)... Overall, we look for 8% EPS CAGR over FY17-19F (after a 3% decline in FY17). EPS is short for earnings per share and CAGR stands for compound annual growth rate.
