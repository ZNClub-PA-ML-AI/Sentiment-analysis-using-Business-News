-0.59,"Singapore: Tsk tsk. What an unnecessary sacrifice of an heir apparent. Just because SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son was having too much fun running his investment empire to give up the reins, chosen successor Nikesh Arora has packed his bags, sold his stock and prepared to depart, even without a destination in mind.
				   
				But why? Son is 58, and former Google executive Arora a mere 48. Considering Warren Buffett is still soldiering on at 85, Son leaving at 60 to spend more time with Pepper, SoftBanks $2,000 robot, would have been a shame. As for the younger mans burning ambition to be his own boss, that could have been mollified with a mix of poetic inspiration and real-world evidence.In the circumstances, John Miltons When I Consider How My Light Is Spent would have been the ideal encouragement. The sonnets last line, They also serve who only stand and wait, could have made a nice office poster for Arora. The fortitude of Florentino Ariza, who waited 51 years, 9 months and 4 days to be united with the love of his life in Love in the Time of Cholera, could have provided reinforcement. In the meantime, Arora might have considered leaving a copy of W. B. Yeatss Sailing to Byzantium lying around for Son. The poems opening line, That is no country for old men, still resonates.Also Read: The trigger for Nikesh Aroras SoftBank resignation

If Arora is less easily persuaded by world literature than by hard numbers, then there are plenty of those, too. A Bloomberg Gadfly analysis of publicly listed companies with a market value of more than $10 billion throws up more than 100 that have executive chairman and chief executive posts occupied by different people, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. On average, the executive chairmanwho usually gets the better officeis 11 years older than the CEO, whos 56.Pointing to that list, Son could have taught Arora some of the finer points of playing second fiddle. Companies as diverse as Next, Expedia, Marriott, Discovery Communications, Dassault, Charles Schwab, Constellation Brands, BNP Paribas, Nike, KDDI and Nippon Telegraph all have CEOs who have been around anywhere between three and 21 years, and who still take orders from above. At Twenty-First Century Fox, CEO James Murdoch, 43, has elder brother Lachlan Murdoch, 44, as executive chairman, father Rupert Murdoch, 85, as non-executive chairman and Chase Carey, 62, as vice-chairman. Thats almost as crowded an affair as X-Men: Apocalypse.Also Read: Nikesh Arora resigns from SoftBank as Masayoshi Son sticks on as CEO

A continued Son-Arora JV could have been less fraught, something like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. In a few decades, SoftBank could have blossomed to a Buffett and Charlie Munger-type partnership, with Son and Arora finishing each others sentences.Alas, it wasnt to be. SoftBank shares rose as much as 3.9% on Wednesday partly because Son, founder of the Internet and mobile-phone giant, is staying in charge. The relief may be short term. Not only has Son lost the man who spearheaded SoftBanks investments in e-commerce startups in Asia, hes also lost a fail-safe for the day when thinking about the next billion-dollar business wont hold the same appeal as stealing a little more time with Pepper.

0.17,"Global steel production rose by 1.9% from a year ago in August, up from the 1.5% growth seen in July, according to the World Steel Association (Worldsteel). China is the main reason why steel output has risen by this much, but global output ex-China too has risen in the past few months. Still, China dominates the steel discussion; in August, for instance, its output rose by 3% versus 0.9% for the rest of the world.
				   
				The rise in output may seem problematic, for Worldsteel had predicted in April that the global demand for steel would decline by 0.8% with Chinas demand declining by 4%. That appears to have changed, especially as China has taken steps to stimulate economic growth. ArcelorMittal said, in its June quarter results statement, that it expects global steel consumption to grow slightly in 2016, without giving a number. It said Chinese steel demand will benefit from growth in the infrastructure and automotive sectors, although real estate has lost momentum.Not just China, India too is contributing to global output growth. The ramp-up of new capacity at its major steel plants has seen its crude steel output increase by 9.4% in August. Sadly, its domestic demand is unable to absorb this level of steel output, as demand for finished steel increased by only 1% in August, according to data from the Joint Plant Committee. In the April-August period, it rose by only 1.3%.Thus, producers have been forced to export finished steel, although domestic sales fetch higher realizations. Exports of finished steel in April-August were up by 23.6%, with August alone seeing an increase of 87.3%. On the positive side, the governments steps to prevent the dumping of steel have benefited local steel producers on the pricing front.Globally, as in India, the main worry is when demand will recover to healthier levels to support this increase in output. Else, it will eventually lead to excess steel on the market that will spill into the global market and upset prices. While everyone appears to look to China to rein in its steel output, it has not shown much sign of relenting so far, although it has been promising to do so.In a move towards consolidation, this week came news that Baoshan Iron and Steel  (part of the Baosteel Group) will acquire Wuhan Iron and Steel, combining to create 60 million tonnes of steel capacity, according to Reuters. If this form of consolidation leads to more discipline on the production front, that is good for the world but if it leads to lower costs for the group while output grows unhindered, then it is of little use for the global steel industry.",2016-09-22,0A79xlrcIAFkQLkItzRBDP,"The rise in output may seem problematic, for Worldsteel had predicted in April that the global demand for steel would decline by 0.8% with Chinas demand declining by 4%",competitor,23:38,Steel output goes up and away
-0.57,"At Mints 10th Annual Banking Conclave on 23 January, Indias top bankers got together to discuss issues confronting the sector such as competition, growth and asset quality. SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya, ICICI managing director (MD) and chief executive officer (CEO) Chanda Kochhar, Punjab National Bank MD and CEO Usha Ananthasubramanian, HDFC Bank MD Aditya Puri, Axis Bank MD and CEO Shikha Sharma, and Citibank India CEO Pramit Jhaveri took part in the discussion on Indian Banking: The new landscape moderated by Tamal Bandyopadhyay. Edited excerpts: 
On increasing competition and the changing banking landscape, with the emergence of differentiated banks:Puri: Competition will come, there will be a change in the financial landscape...congruence of information, technology, mobility, analytics and computing (means) that there will be a change in the business model. All of us are pretty much prepared today to offer every conceivable financial service to the customer in any form he wants. He wants it manually, he wants it on the phone, computerhe can have a complete set of services which include what wallets would do, what payment banks would do. If he comes to our bank say on our mobile phone, he can buy mutual funds, buy insurance, he can download an app like a wallet... he can get his assets report. We are pretty much ahead of the curve. We are not complacent.On foreign banks in India: Jhaveri: If you look back in time in the last 25 years, this industry has been no stranger to competition, this industry has been no stranger to disruption. In the last two decades, we have seen this happen multiple times; this industry is not afraid of competition... Since the financial crisis, the global industry has undergone significant changesome of it is because of the crisis, the new regulatory regime. As far as we are concerned there are natural advantages which we bring to the tablethere is a global footprint, global reach... If you combine that with our strength in India from the technology point of view, disruption point of view, we are very pleased with what we were able to do both on the corporate and consumer side. If you look at the number of milestones which have taken place... things have only got better over time. On the limited growth of foreign banks in India:Jhaveri: At the end of the day, you have to look at the presence you can have in a particular market place around the constraints we operate. At the end of the day, we have a limited branch footprint. When you look at innovations, plenty of which we have had on the consumer side, institution side, I will not bore you with that. You look at the market share (of foreign banks) with a very small physical footprint in the countrythe credit card business, wealth management business; I will not bore you with numbers. Our market share is significant...On the emerging competitive scenario:Ananthasubramanian: If you see Indian banking, every public sector bank remained a regional bank. Post-liberalization, with branch expansion, competition started. It will continue to be on, irrespective of the players coming in... Given the competition, I will say if you lay a cake on this table and everybody takes a piece, the cake will continue to grow. That is the scope of banking. But Indian banks have realized that you have to be on your toes and take competition through the route of technology. The established banks in the country can take on competition and still remain in harmony.Sharma: We will see new forms of competition coming. We have also invested a lot in terms of technology through a range of products to our customers and making sure we are able to differentiate in terms of service. We are pretty well prepared and any functionality customer is looking for, we have a digital footprint around that. We will not be embarrassed. We are excited by some of the competition. In India, today there is still a huge market out there...Jayakumar: Most significant challenge which we face is to complete the transformation exercise. One is to strengthen our basic processes, second is to get digital, analytical, etc., third is significant of people. That is a significant objective at this point of time. That said, we have a bunch of young people who are pushing forward, my perspective of the whole thing is get ourselves fit, get these changes done.Kochhar: I dont think many of us will be able to say different things because already a lot has been spoken. The Indian banking industry has always faced competition because we have certain areas of business that we are following; sometimes it is interest rates and currently technology is disruptive again. New entrants are coming in the field. A lot of changes are happening across...the financial spectrum. A lot of what these small entities can do, banks can also do; banks have a larger relationship with the customers. Second is, competition expands the market, it brings more and more people to the formal lending market.Bhattacharya: We have been alive for the past 111 years... We have in fact used competition at every level to sort of lift up, and in the last 10 years actually in deposits we have gained 300 basis points market share, from 15.3% we are up to 18.3% and in advances we have gained 60 basis points. We have a customer base of 350 million and on a daily basis we were opening 50,000-70,000 accounts...after demonetisation, we alone opened 89 lakh accounts, thats  the kind of the reach we have. Demonetisation gave us a boost in ensuring our BC (business correspondent) channels were really active, we have a huge amount of collaboration. We have 235,00 PoS (point of sales) machines which are paying out cash; competition makes us tougher, wiser and better.On how easy or difficult is it to change public sector banks:Jayakumar: One is to look at a parallel transformational exercise SBI has done. I have spoken to their CEOs, past and present. As far as changes are concerned, there will be some resistance; once plans start showing results, resistance starts coming off... I think it has lot to do with the way we communicate, but accept that there will be some pushback and you have to pick the right battles. On impact of demonetisation on monetary transmission:Bhattacharya: In Indian banks, 97% of resources come from deposits. Therefore, if you are not cutting rates of deposit, you will not be able to pass on that benefit (of lower rates). You cut rates of deposits when they are plentiful in the system. It is a simple law of demand and supply. All the banks are saying that if RBI (Reserve Bank of India) cuts rates and keeps liquidity tight, there is no way transmission can occur. Till March this year, liquidity was very very tight. However, because of the huge deposits that have come into the system, we are able to reduce the cost of deposits and automatically that will flow into cost of borrowing. A lot of us are held back, we are not sure how much of those resources will stay with us. If these resources prove to be stable, which we will get to know in the next 2-3 months, you will see deposit rates further falling... you will see impact on borrower side. On deposits, we are quite conservative; on loan side not so. The reason is that is we want to give a fillip to credit growth, with so much of deposits hanging on our hands if I dont give a fillip to credit growth I will not be able to make the best of the situation. On deposits side we are still being conservative.Puri: At the moment we have a tremendous amount of supply. If money is tight and we are not dependent on our borrowers funds, then unless the supply of money exceeds demand, rates will not come down... Sharma: For a quarter I will expect rates to remain low depending on when restrictions on withdrawls are removed. We will go quarter by quarter.Ananthasubramanian: This is a kind of one-off event that has happened in the countrys history. This kind of accretion we have never seen. Bank deposits have surged... Maybe, I am guessing, 40% will stay with us...For a short while, it will be an advantage that will flow to the customers.Kochhar: We should recognize this was a one of its kind event. Even in the first six months of the year, total accretion to the banking system was Rs5.4 trillion but just in these two months, accretion was another Rs6 trillion. In that sense liquidity has come into the banking system and therefore reduces the lending rate. Some part of it will go back to the system, and some should go back to the system. Impact on interest rates is (that) we will definitely remain in a soft interest rate regime.Ananthasubramanian: In the post-demonetisation era, what has happened is, specially women I speak of, that money has moved from masala dabbas to the banking sector. People have opened accounts, money has moved into the system, that is one. It is very important to educate (customers) and plan strategy with them, which is happening. People are being educated about various services like SIPs (systematic investment plans)...Jhaveri: When you look at credit offtake and investment, we tend to focus just on the private sector. When you look at different offtakes, we talked about consumers, households. I think there is no problem with credit offtake. As far as private corporate sector is concerned, working capital needs to increase, there are certain clear indications that working capital cycle is increasing. Hopefully, that will be followed over time as some will start increasing capacity utilization. It has been a tough period in terms of credit offtake...Kochhar: When you look at credit growth, lets also look at two things in terms of how the Indian economy is structurally changing. One is supply of credit itself, if you look at the last one year, there was a Rs4 trillion increase in the banking credit; there is an equal amount of issuance of bonds and commercial paperwe tend to ignore that. Second is that structure of economy is also changing...Its not just about working capital increase of a particular company, how it is translating into a lot of start-ups that are then increasing multiplier impact on the economy...Sharma: On retail side, as everybody has said, growth has been reasonably heavy, and some products are more interest rate-sensitivefor instance mortgages, very interest rate-sensitive. The fact that interest rates have come off, helps the mortgage market; may be right now people are waiting (in the hope) that home prices will correct next quarter or so; home loans should see annual growth from here, auto loans and retail loans have done well... We expect working capital growth to pick up. As far as private investment is concerned, we need to wait for the consumption cycle to play out. Credit growth of double digits is a good number. Bhattacharya: Investments happen when your existing capacity starts getting utilized to around 80-85%. Now for that to happen, demand has to go up. At this point of time, two things will make demand go up. Because demand in this country exists, its a question of people actually executing on that demand. One is business confidence goes up and two ease of doing business goes up. Both of these two are very important. Government has in its hands one very potent trigger that can actually be used for doing both the things, that is the budget. In the budget, it has been our recommendationboosting both consumption and investment. Now if this is done in proper manner I do believe it can act as a very good trigger. This along with resolution of large stressed assets on which we are working on very, very assiduously. These two things can actually bring back the demand.On pain caused to the informal economy by demonetisation, impact on demand:Puri: I think in most of the organized sector and sectors that moved from the unorganized to the organized sector, it (demand) has pretty much returned. I talked to Bharat Puri at Pidilite, he is seeing a return to whatever was there on 8 November; I talked to Harsh Mariwala (Marico Ltd chairman), he is also surprised with the V recovery; then I see for ourselves, we are back to 8 November.Sharma: I think what Aditya said is that in the formal sector or which has moved to the formal sector, recovery has surprised all by being V-shaped but the segments which are cash segment parts of agriculture, there I think the recovery is slower.Puri: The second part is that the parts of the economy that are moving from informal to formal sector also will create demand for assets. What you were financing previously though cash will now have to be financed with the banks.On banks asset quality. Is the worst over?Bhattacharya: One must understand somethingthat non-performing assets (NPAs) are not a one-time occurrence. NPAs are an occurrence that happen throughout the life of any institution, not only for banks, even for businesses. Even businesses have to write off some amount of receivables. What happened in this case was that a large number of units, especially in infrastructure, went bad because investments happened in one short and small space of time and many of the investments could not result in the ultimate assets getting created and cash flows getting established. This happened on account of many, many things that happened in the economy in a particular space of time. Having said that, I must say that whatever the government has done for enabling better resolution is going to have its effect, it may not have yet started...Yes, the worst is over...These are evolving times. Impact of demonetisation on SMEs (small and medium enterprises), that will come with a lag of about a quarter. It takes time to trickle down into the banks book. By March 2017, we should look at things getting better.Kochhar: When we talk of NPAs we generally just get stuck with recognition and numbers. Important point is recognition, resolution and provision. Now, if you look at banks in India, recognition-wise there are RBI rules, not just that. RBI followed earlier recognition through the AQR (asset quality review), we have also been doing that. As far as provisions are concerned, some banks have been proactive to actually provide more to the extent possible. On recognition and provisioning, a lot of work has happened.What is very important is that...we give equal amount of focus on resolution...Jayakumar: I am not focused on gross NPA ratio and that number for us has been coming down. Second, there are risks in the mid-market segment. Three, one hopes some of the larger accounts get resolved; that will provide us with some upgrades that will pay for the litigation. Overall I think we will be within the forecast that is provided.",2017-01-30,0Ab1voUw7w35LqJc80J1pL,"At Mints 10th Annual Banking Conclave, Indias top bankers discuss issues confronting the sector such as competition, growth and asset quality",competitor,02:58,Mint Annual Banking Conclave | The changing landscape of Indian banking

				Barra, who led Xiaomis international expansion, will now take on a different challenge as vice president of virtual reality. He will need to navigate the competitive and young market, where Facebooks Oculus Rift and Gear products have drawn interest but not dominance.Barra will draw on his experience building an operating system business, with Googles Android, and a hardware brand, with Xiaomis phones, to help Oculus. Facebook in December gave the chief executive officer of Oculus, Brendan Iribe, a narrower role and started looking for a replacement for the division.Facebook bought Oculus for about $2 billion in 2014. CEO Mark Zuckerberg envisions virtual reality as a social platform, and says Barra will help the company achieve that. Competitors have been more focused on gaming.Hugo shares my belief that virtual and augmented reality will be the next major computing platform, Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post. Theyll enable us to experience completely new things and be more creative than ever before.Barra resigned from Beijing-based Xiaomi after a turbulent four years during which it rose to the top of its home market before local rivals mimicked its model and dethroned the brand. He was given the task of taking the Chinese company global, helping it make inroads into India, where sales topped $1 billion for the first time in 2016.Latest estimates from Canalys and Counterpoint Research put Xiaomi among the top five sellers in the country, considered the worlds fastest-growing major phone market. The company however has struggled elsewhere, notably in Brazil, Barras home country.Xiaomi was last valued at $45 billion in 2014, making it one of the worlds largest startups. It drew comparisons to Apple Inc. after doubling revenue that year and climbing to the top of the Chinese smartphone market . Its since struggled, missing its 2015 shipments target and falling behind Chinese brands, Vivo, Oppo and Huawei. Its been a dream of mine to work in virtual reality even back when AR/VR were just figments of science fiction; now were taking selfies in virtual worlds, Barra said in comments on Zuckerbergs Facebook post.

0.33,"Seoul: Samsung Electronics Co Ltd on Thursday said it aims to recover quickly from the disastrous withdrawal of the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 that dragged third-quarter mobile earnings to their lowest in nearly eight years. 
				   
				The worlds top smartphone maker saw its mobile earnings plunge 98% from a year earlier to its lowest since the fourth quarter of 2008, barely avoiding its first-ever loss and dragging the firms overall profit to a two-year low. Samsung said July-September operating profit was 5.2 trillion won ($4.57 billion), matching its revised guidance. The South Korean firm had initially estimated a 7.8 trillion won profit but cut its guidance to reflect losses incurred in the withdrawal of the fire-prone Note 7s.Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the company expects earnings to improve (from a year earlier) driven by strong performance in the components business, Samsung said in a statement. The mobile business expects a recovery in its earnings to a similar level with that of the fourth quarter of 2015.The mobile division booked an operating profit of 100 billion won in the third quarter. Earnings from smartphones and tablets have been the main driver of Samsungs rise into a global tech giant, accounting for 38% of total income last year. Samsung said it aims to bolster fourth-quarter earnings through its Galaxy S7 phones and new lower-tier models in a bid to record profit close to the 2.23 trillion won it reported in October-December of 2015. I am not positive about Samsungs mobile business until the first quarter, although the components division will remain solid, SK Securities analyst Kim Young-woo said.The Apple Inc rival has already warned of another $3.1 billion hit to profit through the first quarter of 2017, all but guaranteeing a third straight year of earnings decline for the smartphone business. Investors now expect sweeping management changes and restructuring in response to the Note 7 failure, while warily watching for signs of long-term impacts on the sales of other Samsung brands.Samsung shares were up 0.5% in early trade after the results announcement, compared with a 0.4% gain for the broader market.FrustrationsMany are frustrated that Samsung still does not know what caused the fires in some of the Note 7 devices that were sent to customers as replacements for the initial 2.5 million phones it recalled due to fire-prone batteries.The company gave no further insights in its earnings announcement. Development of the next Galaxy S smartphone  expected to launch in March 2017  has slowed as Samsung works to make sure there will be no repeat of the over-heating problem, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. The launch is unlikely to be brought forward to make up for Note 7 sales, the source said, contrary to some investors belief that the new Galaxy S will be fast-tracked. Stronger earnings from the companys components businesses was a bright spot in the third-quarter results. The semiconductor division reported a 3.37 trillion won profit for July-September, its highest since the third quarter of 2015.

They are talking to some of the existing investors of the company, too, to pick the stake from them, said one of the two people cited above, requesting anonymity, as the talks are private.According to the second person cited above, the bank is looking to sell its stake at a price that would value Mswipe at $200-250 million.Around the last time they raised funds, the company was valued at close to $150 million. The price which they are seeking could get them up to $20 million for their stake, he said.The last fund-raising at Mswipe was in July 2015, when the company raised Rs160 crore in a Series C round from new investors such as Falcon Edge Capital, Ola Cabs and Meru Capital.Existing investors Matrix Partners India, Axis Bank Ltd and DSG Consumer Partners also participated in the funding round.Axis Bank first invested in the company in early 2013.Emails sent to Axis Bank and Mswipe on Friday went unanswered.Mswipe was founded in 2012 by Manish Patel, a doctor by education, who previously co-founded an alcoholic beverages distribution company called Milestone Merchandise. Mswipe provides a mobile payment solution with a card reader, which can be attached to any mobile phones audio (headset) jack. The company also provides similar card payment solutions for smartphones.It works closely with smaller banks such as Corporation Bank, RBL Bank Ltd, Shamrao Vithal Co-op.

Its clients include small and medium enterprises.In the payments services market, Mswipe competes with companies such as Ezetap and Paynear.In August 2015, Ezetap raised Rs150 crore from Social+Capital, Helion Advisors and Berggruen Holdings, Horizons Ventures and the Capricorn Investment Group.In December 2015, Paynear raised around Rs16 crore from a high net-worth individual investor.According to a March 2015 report by Ken Research, the payment services industry grew at a compound annual growth rate of 147.6% between the financial years 2012 and 2014.The research firm believes that the Indian payments market will continue to grow at a strong rate going ahead. The payments market is driven largely by transactions through mobile point of sale terminals and mobile banking, the report said.For Axis Bank, plans to sell its stake in Mswipe come at a time when the bank is facing stress due to loans that soured.In the quarter to September, the private sector bank reported a 83% plunge in net profit at Rs319 crore, primarily on account of higher provisioning for bad loans.The bank had posted a net profit of Rs1,915.64 crore in the same period in 2015-16.Gross non-performing assets (NPA) and net NPAs at the bank rose to 4.17% and 2.02%, respectively in the quarter.",2016-11-15,0SArJpfqkiCBj82GYYIncL,Axis Bank may sell its 8% stake in mobile payments firm Mswipe for around $20 million in a deal that is likely to value that firm at $200-250 million,competitor,00:47,Axis Bank in talks to sell Mswipe stake
-0.66,"Surprisingly, in less than a month after the March quarter results were announced, stocks of leading hotel chains in the country have bounced back after years of doing nothing much. Shares of Indian Hotels Co. Ltd (IHCL), represented by the Taj brand, lead the pack and are up 25%. Another stock, TajGVK Hotels and Resorts Ltd, is up 18%, while others like EIH Ltd are inching up too.
				   
				The reason for the sudden appetite for hotel stocks is the better-than-expected recovery in the domestic hospitality business. March quarter revenue grew by around 10%, with operating margin expansion beating analysts estimates.Moreover, the clouds of overcapacity in the luxury hotel segment are gradually receding. Prospects for better room tariffs and occupancy rates (ORs) are thus improving. An analysts presentation by IHCL says that while supply of rooms increased by 3.9% during fiscal year 2016 over the previous year, demand grew by 10.5%.Interestingly, demand growth is being fuelled by higher domestic ORs across cities. If this continues, room rates could gradually move up, leading to growth in average revenue per room.And thats not all. Foreign tourist arrivals (FTA) into the country grew by 10% in the first three months of calendar year 2016. This is commendable, given the damp global economic sentiment and after the single-digit growth seen annually since 2009.All these factors promise a rise in revenue in the medium term, very important for luxury hotel chains that have been languishing with excess capacity. Further, the fact that most hotels have deferred or cancelled any expansion plans is good news, as it will help improve balance sheet health of these firms.Some are trying to trim existing debt too. According to ICICI Securities Ltd, IHCLs debt should come down in the coming years, given its strategy to follow an asset-light business model, where it will undertake more contracts. Its plan to divest low-margin yielding assets, like the one in Boston, will improve cash flows and profitability in the long run.

-0.69,"Akash Gupta is co-founder and chief technology officer at GreyOrange, a robotics firm founded in 2011 along with his friend and partner Samay Kohli, who is the chief executive officer.  In an interview, Gupta talks about the journey of GreyOrange and its future plans. Edited excerpts:
				   
				Tell us something about your background and how you got interested in robotics.
Samay and I met at BITS Pilani. He is two years my senior and we met during a human robotics project where we were trying to build robots, got interested in human robotics, built the AcYut and took part in a lot of competitions all around the world, represented India in the human robotics competitions. The ROBOlympics (now RoboGames) happens in San Francisco every year so the first time we came sixth, then got the bronze and then finally got the gold. We took part in the midsize humanoid category, which is basically where a human-looking robot, about a metre in height, is involved in a kung fu competition with another robot. These robots are remote-controlled. Then, we gradually started building autonomous humanoid robots to take part in a soccer competition for robots. So we added vision, so that the robots could kick the ball, and take their own autonomous decisions while playing. After this, we got requests for giving workshops/tutorials on humanoid robotics. Humanoid as a project is very expensive as it costs Rs40-45 lakh a year on three robots, so there was no option but to raise funds for the same. For this purpose, we formed a company and called it GreyOrange. We did about 35-40 workshops in 2011 and were enjoying ourselves but soon figured out this was not something we wanted to do in the long-term. So we shifted from doing workshops to doing product development for different companies like C&C Technologies in the US and some South Korean companies. But we were not getting good at anything because the products were from different domains. We realized that we were not building any core competency, so both Samay and I thought that we should try to focus on one particular industry. So we did some research, had some industries in mind for automation like the railways, which is highly non-automated, oil and gas maintenance, and  e-commerce and warehousing. The problem with the first two industries was that they were very slow at that time while e-commerce was developing, so we chose that industry to start  building products. At that point of time we also met Wolfgang Hoeltgen in Germany in one of the science and technology fairs at Hanover, and he really liked our idea and provided us with angel funding. In January 2012, we took our first office in Gurgaon and spent about Rs55 lakh on hardware prototyping and that was a really good decision because it helped our product development capability more than what anything else would have done. We started with two products: the butler system and sortation system, and fast forward to today where we have more than 500 people, three product lines (the butler system, linear sortation and cross-belt sortation), 50-plus installations.Describe your products and how they help automate warehouses?
Linear sortation systems are used to sort shipments. One of the major use case is once your shipments are picked and packed, they need to be sorted according to destinations or locations, because then they need to catch corresponding trucks or flights, so our sortation systems helps you sort that and also capture the volumetric and weight of the packetthis is required for billing for the courier company.Linear sortation system is like a conveyor machine that has arms that help in sorting packages and have different throughput which means the number of packets that can be sorted and weighed in an hour. So the machine can sort from 1,500 packets an hour to about 14,000 an hour. You can also use this system to combine different items in orders. What the butler system does is when an order is placed, then somebody takes a pick-list and picks the ordered objects from different parts of the warehouse, comes back, sorts them, packs them and sends them. The butler makes the picking, putting combining very, very easy. What it does is it completely transforms the paradigm from man going to the goods to goods coming to the man. In the butler system, the people stand at the periphery of the warehousewe call these pick-put stationsand the bots basically bring the racks to them for whatever they need to pick. Bots will then go and store the racks back to their location. So lets say in an apparel industry 120-180 items per day can be picked manually, the butler system can pick 300-600 items in an hourthats the kind of jump we are talking about in the throughput of the warehouse.  The whole process is really dynamic and the order goes directly to our server and the server directs the robots. This has reduced pilferage too, as we have limited the interaction of people to the periphery. What are your future plans and strategy?
There is a lot of innovation you can drive through these products, every six months we are driving new features, improving speed, giving more customization to our clients. There is room for a lot of optimization, efficiency and accuracy, so we are constantly working on that.  We have one major R&D (research and development) office in Gurgaon, but we have service centres across India. We are expanding to South-East Asia. We have an office in Singaporethere is a 14-people team that looks at solutions, marketing, sales. South-East Asia is a big market and since the past 12 months we are going aggressively into it. We have also invested in a company in Japan that is our exclusive partner for distributing our butler systems in there. So we are in process of installing butler systems in Japan. The Middle East is a growing market with Saudi Arabia, so we have set up an office there and we are starting operations there. We also have a small office in Hong Kong and are now looking to expand to Germany. So now our major impetus is expanding overseas and getting a few anchor clients overseas. As regards the products, we are building newer versions every 6-12 months. We invest heavily in R&D as thats the core of our company. We would like to disrupt our products every three years. We also have people working on R&D from outside India, so they can start contributing to the product since we expect to serve a global market so its important to get perspective from different geographies. We are hiring engineers from Germany and the US, so our R& D team is cross-geography. How do you envision your company 10 years down the line?
We are definitely looking to get public and an IPO (initial public offering) is one of the most viable options to take this forward. But not immediately. One thing we are trying to build at the core is a very strong product engine at the back-end, have a team of people who can produce very complex, good quality hardware plus software products, which is the core of the company. If you build a good product engine, then you can pick any industry and disrupt it by building these products. So we are giving thought to things like product life cycle, processes, how we train our engineers and build products that are reliable, have a high life cycle of 7-10 years, are of international quality and are globally acceptable. That is one of the challenges, so we really dont want only to build a butler or sorter but to build a strong product engine so that every three years we take an industry and disrupt it. Thats where we want to reach before we do any IPO.So the next 12-18 months are going to be all about global expansion and reducing our warehousing cost to the lowest possible and adding more products to our portfolio, so that we have a range of products. On the software side, we are building a platform that can run a warehouse end-to-end.",2016-09-26,0W6HaSp2RRPe1CYw3fkxXM,"Akash Gupta, co-founder and chief technology officer at GreyOrange, speaks about the journey of GreyOrange and its future plans

				The centre will also house the companys largest information technology organization outside of the companys global headquarters. Mint had in October 2015 first reported about Fords plans to set up a global technology and business centre in India.India is not only a vibrant market for cars and new mobility ideas, it also is rich with talent, technical expertise and ingenuity, executive chairman Bill Ford said in a statement. This new center will help us attract the best and brightest, and make Chennai a true hub of innovation for Ford around the world. Once it gets completed in 2019, the centre will become Fords third global product development centre in Asia Pacific and part of Fords global product development network.It also will feature a wide range of laboratories and testing facilities for both full vehicles and components, enabling Ford to conduct extensive testing of future vehicles in India, the company said in a statement. However, Tuesdays announcement is unlikely to help Fords India operations immediately and the focus will be more on feeding into the Detroit-based companys global operations.Ford in India continues to struggle even after being present in the country for more than 20 years, in which the Indian market has changed drastically.In the six years between 2010-11 and 2015-16, the American car makers annual sales in India have grown only twice. Sales reached the highest at 98,537 units in 2010-11 because of the success of the Figo but they declined to 92,665 units and 77,225 units in 2011-12 and 2012-13, respectively. Sales grew in 2013-14 and fell in 2014-15 only to rise again in 2015-16, albeit on a smaller base. During the same period, the Indian passenger vehicle market expanded from 2.52 million units to 2.78 million.In recent times, the companys second generation Figo failed to receive the kind of response that the previous one did. Ford did create a new compact SUV segment with the EcoSport, but it failed to capitalize on the first-mover advantage. The segment is now dominated by market leader Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Hyundai Motor India Ltd. Ford, along with Volkswagen India Pvt. Ltd, was the last one to enter the sub-four-metre sedan category but demand in the segment has waned, which meant lukewarm response for the American car makers Figo Aspire.In pursuit of making its business sustainable, the company has changed tack and shifted focus to exports, which grew 41.37% to 55,821 units between April and September.Indias overall car exports grew 3.89% to 319,579 units.In the new centre in Chennai, the company will hire 3,000 skilled workers over the next five years. Ford also will consolidate 9,000 employees from six existing facilities in Chennai on the 28-acre campus, the company said in a statement.Ford has invested over $2 billion in India to set up two plants, one each in Chennai and Sanand in Gujarat.

-0.56,"A presentation that Tata Global Beverages Ltd made last week to US-based investors gave a spring to its share briefly, before it cracked along with the market in the aftermath of Indias surgical strike across the border. After gaining 5% mid-week, it closed the week ended 30 September below the previous weeks close.
				   
				One item in the presentation, in particular, may have caught the attention of investors. Going forward, it says, the company wants to increase focus on India, beef up its presence in Asia and the Middle East, and re-evaluate stressed businesses. That may be a good thing.Now, the focus on India may seem strange. After all, South Asia (mainly comprising India) already contributes to 42% of turnover. Other important markets are Great Britain and EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) which contribute to 30% of sales, and the US, Canada and Australia which contribute to 28%. Tea is the major product, accounting for nearly three-fourths of sales except in the US, where its coffee. The coffee business is mainly under its listed subsidiary Tata Coffee Ltd.So, why is this shift in focus important? Black tea consumption is going down in many developed markets, although its not a new development. Over the years, Tata Global has ventured into newer forms of tea, such as green, speciality, fruit infusions and the like. But the going is not easy. For one, the market is competitive and retailers drive a tough bargain to give consumers good prices. Second, the market for other types of tea is relatively fragmented.Also, the lowering of black tea consumption is not being replaced fully by other forms of tea. In the UK, for instance, sales of ordinary tea bags are estimated to have declined by 14% between 2013 and 2016, according to market research provider Mintel. While sales of varieties such as green, speciality and herbal grew, that was not enough. Overall tea sales are estimated to decline by 5% in 2016. In markets such as these, across Europe and Canada, Tata Globals focus is on growing in the non-black tea segment, and growing or at least maintaining share in the shrinking black tea market. Thats an uphill task.That explains the focus on markets such as South Asia, where India is the main market but neighbouring countries are tea drinking markets too. The Middle East too is a good opportunity. These countries will have established and strong incumbents, making it difficult to grow market share. In India, where its the market leader, the opportunity is to convert more people drinking loose tea to branded tea, and then nudge them up to drink its premium stuff.In South Asia, at least the core black tea market is still a growing one. A relook at stressed businesses could mean a lowering of losses, which should benefit profitability. Tata Global had taken impairments in some Eastern European markets earlier.Eventually, all this has to translate to higher growth and returns from the tea business. In FY16, the companys operating income rose by 1.4% while operating profit fell by 17%. FY17 is off to a good start with the June quarter operating profit rising by 32%. Some of that is attributable to lower commodity costs, which can change depending on annual global tea leaf output. Tata Globals share has risen by over a fifth in the past three months, partly on expectations of a better performance. If it does embark on a path that promises to lower costs and grow revenues, investors would be happy to come along for the ride.",2016-10-02,0m4SIpscOwgzqHT8fxyOeN,"If Tata Global Beverages does embark on a path that promises to lower costs and grow revenues, investors would be happy to come along for the ride",competitor,23:51,Tata Global Beverages: in search of tea drinkers
1.0,"New Delhi: Railway minister Suresh Prabhu on Tuesday unveiled a plan to save Rs41,000 crore over 10 years through an integrated energy management system.
				   
				According to Indian Railways Mission 41k initiative, the national carrier will electrify 24,000km of rail tracks over the next five years by doubling the annual rate of electrification from 2,000km to 4,000km in the next two years. To achieve this target, the railways plans to follow the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) model of awarding contracts for railway electrification projects. It also plans to mechanize the execution through self-propelled wiring trains among other initiatives.ALSO READ: Suresh Prabhu unveils non-fare revenue policy for Indian RailwaysPrabhu said switching from diesel to electric can help railways in a big way. Through electrification, railways can reduce dependence on imported fuel and rationalize the cost of energy. He added that the 10-year plan, which started in 2015 on a pilot basis, will continue till 2025 and has already started yielding results.Railways has already saved Rs300 crore during 2015-16 and Rs1,000 crore till November 2016. We hope this year the savings would be around Rs1,800 crore through energy management, said a railway ministry official, requesting anonymity.Apart from electrification of tracks, the other initiatives under Mission 41k are change in the carriers energy mix by using more green energy through 1,000 megawatt (MW) solar and 200MW wind plants, installation of LED lights and bulbs across all railway stations, trains and offices.If consumption of only one class of fuel grows, it will lead to skewed development of the energy mix, said B. Ashok, chairman of Indian Oil Corp., the countrys largest oil marketing company. During 2014-15, the total energy cost of Indian Railways was Rs31,220 crore. This included expenditure of Rs10,436 crore towards electric traction which carries about two thirds of the total freight and about 50% of passenger traffic; R 18,586 crore towards diesel traction which carries the balance one-third of freight and about 50% of passenger traffic and Rs2,198 crore towards supply of electrical energy to various offices, workshops and railway stations, etc. The move comes as railways projects a six-fold increase in its passenger and freight traffic by 2030. The passenger and freight traffic on the railways in India is expected to grow from 3.64 trillion passenger kilometers and 961 billion tonne kilometres respectively in 2005 to 19.4 trillion passenger kilometres and 6.68 trillion tonne kilometres, respectively by 2030.",2017-01-18,0pohrH57gXWqdyJ1vdzmsL,"Railway minister Suresh Prabhu says that as part of Mission 41k, railway electrification can reduce dependence on imported fuel and rationalize energy cost",company,00:49,"Prabhu unveils 10-year energy plan for Railways to save Rs41,000 crore"
-0.25,"Ahmedabad: Billionaire Gautam Adani, chairman of the Adani Group, talks about the companys $16 billion coal project in Australia in an interview after winning a series of court battles that once threatened to derail the controversial mining project.
ALSO READ | Gautam Adani says debt level not a concern, eyes new sectorsThe Gujarat-based businessman also discusses his plans for solar, the next sunrise sectors for the group, the changing Indian economic scenario, compensatory tariff issues for its thermal power plants and the Adani Sagar Mala, a string of ports across the country. Edited excerpts:After much delay, your plans to build one of the worlds largest coal mines in Australia seems back on track with the recent court rulings being in your favour and the Australian government extending full support to the project. How do you see your Australian dreams unfolding? Also, you have faced similar resistance from environmental groups in India too in the past. What do you find in common in the two?After four long years of approval processes and unnecessary  struggles in courts, we have finally overcome the hurdles and we hope to take it to our board (Adani Enterprises) for final investment decisions by March. The Carmichael mine, rail and port project includes the development of a world-class mine with phase one production of 25 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) in FY21. This includes 388-km standard gauge multi-user railway line of 60 mtpa capacity and related port expansions. The coal from this mine would be used to fire our power projects in Mundra and Udupi.The recent successful meeting with Australian federal, state and regional leaders not only enhanced our confidence but also has paved the way for enhancing trade multi-fold between the two nations.The much-needed infrastructure for the project will open up the Galilee Basin and put Australia in a competitive position in a global sea-borne market. The total life of mine capex is about $16 billion and we would have invested about $4.5 billion in the first phase.Now, coming to the other part, I will tell you that we remain fully committed and very confident of the environmental impact studies we commission and all this information is public. Be it India or Australia or any other country, the impact studies we do are world-class and we use consultants of global repute to augment our very strong internal team.There have been several positive recent court outcomes in Australia that rejected the claims of what are largely activist-inspired appeals and uphold the strong approvals process by the governments in Australia that we have complied with. These activist-motivated appeals are at odds with the strong local community support in the regions the projects are based. So, the court wins provide more confidence around the project time-frames for Adani and meeting demand in India as well as for the supporting communities in Australia.Just like any other company in our sector, there will always be some resistance for different reasons and its a part of our business to be able to address these in a transparent and scientific manner.There are both differences and similarities between activist activities in the two nations. Increasingly these are political campaigns with wider objectives and often with funding and support by global NGOs. Regrettably, these campaigns often dont recognize that in many respects, India and Adani are at the forefront of finding the right balance between our leadership on renewable energy and the fact that our developing economy also needs the affordable thermal energy that many other nations still rely on for their base load.We continue to look for opportunities in mining sector across the globe as we aspire to be world leaders in the integrated pit-to-plug strategy in our energy vertical. It includes mines, rail and port developments.You seem to have got a clear ambition to be a dominant player in the sectors that you venture into, be it ports, power, mining or the more recently forayed renewable energy business. What is the next sunrise sector for you?It is important to understand that for a growth economy like India, even our core sectors of ports, power (including solar) and mining remain sunrise sectors, given the sheer potential ahead. All you need to do is to look at China and see what they have done over the past 25 years to be able to realize that the real period of growth for India within our core sectors is still ahead of us. A 7+% GDP (gross domestic product) growth rate and the strong policy advocacy that we are seeing from the government will provide the additional tail wind for companies like us to keep growing our business at healthy double-digit rates.That being said, we are certainly evaluating other sectors that include coal conversions, defence and water. However, its too early to say which of these would be the next sunrise sector for us.Solar seems to have taken a top priority for the group in recent times. You have also set up the worlds largest solar plant in Tamil Nadu.Solar indeed has taken a significant priority and is a great example of how rapidly we capitalize on opportunities. Over the past 18 months, we have built a confirmed pipeline of 2,000MW of solar power, commissioned the worlds largest solar plant in Tamil Nadu in a record period of nine months.We have a target of contributing 10% of capacity in the national target under Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) of 100,000MW of grid-connected solar power by 2022. Accordingly, we aim to set up 10,000MW of solar power plants and at least 10,000MW of solar parks during this period. One has to remember that ultimately, the speed of learning cycles and the execution experience makes all the difference and at this time, we are doing this perhaps faster than any other player in the world. In Australia too, we have focused plans to enter the renewable energy sector.You have announced $1 billion for a solar panels and solar cells production facility. What kind of opportunity do you see in solar manufacturing for an Indian company?We are in the process of commissioning a 1.2GW, Indias largest integrated solar manufacturing facility, to produce polysilicon, ingots, wafers, cells and modules and ancillary products under Make in India initiative at Mundra (Gujarat) in multiple phases.One has to understand that under the JNNSM programme, we are talking about establishing a 100GW solar generation capacity by 2022. No country in the world has ever accelerated their solar programmes at the pace this government has set out to do. India is set to become one of the leaders in the world in renewable energy generation in the days to come. Indian solar power market is expected to grow at CAGR of more than 60% for next five to 10 years. With solar tariffs coming in grid parity with that of thermal power and going forward is expected to come down further, future energy demand will be met from the solar projects.Currently, Indian solar manufacturing is inefficient compared to some international markets due to many reasons like obsolete and inflexible units of existing manufacturers, lack of economy of scale, dependence on imported raw material, etc. Large scale, end to end, vertically integrated solar manufacturing facility like that at Mundra will have a significant edge over currently established cell and module manufacturing units in India and can easily compete with worlds leading producers. Yes, there will be competition, but one has to recognize that we must have the confidence that the only way we can be a major player in the solar area is to be able to compete across the solar value chain using global benchmarks and therefore we need to use our integrated strategy as a differentiator.There were reports about your talks to take over some assets of Sun Edison in India. What is the current status? We evaluate various business opportunities continuously. Lot of projects in India, which were aggressively bid out, are in market looking for buyers/investors. Some of these were just taken to be later sold to potential buyers before or soon after the development. We looked at some of the assets but then decided that it made more sense to organically develop the businessat least as of now. As regards Sun Edison, we heard from media reports that Greenko is in advanced stage of discussions.Moving from solar, tell us what is happening in thermal power projects. The fluctuating coal prices and compensation tariff have been a concern for the company for quite some time now.From the very beginning, our goal has been to generate 20,000MW by 2020. Indian power sector has witnessed rapid advancement over the past few years with installed capacity surpassing 300GW and electricity demand reaching 1,100 billion units. Indias current per capita power consumption is over 1,000kWh (kilowatt hour) per capita per annum and aspires to reach 2,000kWh per capita per annum by 2024. With current power-generation capacity of around 11,000MW, Adani Power is already the largest private power producer in India. We have always ensured fast-paced execution of projects and implemented the best available technologies and practices that can serve as benchmarks for the power industry.The company has already got relief from Appellate Tribunal for Electricity, which held in its judgment that changes in Indonesian regulations affecting discounted coal prices under contract is a force majeure event under the PPAs (power-purchase agreements) and asked the central regulator to grant appropriate relief. The matter has been sub judice from last four years and therefore, though coal price is falling, the company has been under severe financial stress due to delay in grant of appropriate relief. Despite a long legal battle, we are honouring our commitments to supply power. Similarly, grant of relief is also pending for the tariff of power supply from Kawai (Rajasthan) and Tiroda (Maharashtra) power plants.Are you looking for further expansions or acquisitions in the power sector?Yes, we are looking to continue our expansion and I expect some of it will be inorganic. The Indian power sector is witnessing consolidation among the private sector developers. We are looking at all opportunities, brownfield and greenfield projects. A lot of the power projects up for acquisition come with multiple challenges such as transmission evacuation, rail connectivity, no PPA, no domestic coal supply and many more.How have things changed in the power sector under the new leadership at the centre?The proof of success lies in metrics and I think the numbers speak for themselves. I have already spoken about how solar power has been catalysed by the policy initiatives taken by the government. Average solar tariffs are now at Rs4 per unit and this is a tremendous achievement by any yardstick or measure and the long-term cascading benefits of this in helping industries, getting power to rural areas as well as galvanizing the solar value chain in India will be significant.From providing a lifeline to the ailing state-owned power distribution utilities (discoms) in the form of UDAY (Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana) scheme, introducing amendments in the National Tariff Policy, ramping up the countrys traditionally neglected transmission network and boosting domestic coal supply, many initiatives have been introduced by the centre to facilitate sustainable growth in the power sector.In our view, the centre has set the reform process in motion, which has already made a difference, but the full impact will be felt only in the long run.For the groups most successful business, ports, has there been any change in strategy for attaining your previously articulated goal of reaching 200 mtpa by 2020? Also, you have built a huge network of ports across the country, making acquisitions in the east and south. What is the overall strategy?With a strategy to serve large Indian hinterland, APSEZ (Adani Ports and SEZ Ltd) has developed and operates 10 ports/terminals across the coastline of India. All our ports and terminals are strategically located, making a string of ports or the Adani Sagar Mala. This network of multi-cargo ports enables us to cater to major consumption and resource-rich regions of India. The addition of the Kattupalli port (in Tamil Nadu) earlier this year to augment our flanking strategy along with its sister Ennore port in Chennai has been yet another success with volumes at the Kattupalli port already doubling since we have taken over operations. Kattupalli has a tremendous location and we plan to convert it to a multi-cargo port to further capitalize on this advantage. In Kerala, our plan to build out the Vizhinjam transhipment port at the southern-most tip of India is on track and this will be yet another strategic port that will draw traffic from the worlds busiest shipping routes as well as allow our own countrys traffic to be transhipped within our country.In FY16, we handled a cargo volume of 151 MMT and we are expecting 10-15% cargo growth in FY17. While we are seeing growth in cargo handling at our existing ports, we are also expanding our presence across the Indian coastline. Given the growth rates, we have seen in the ports sector and the progress made over the last few years we will reach our target of 200 mtpa well before 2020, most likely well before the end of 2018.We are also targeting to provide value-added services to our customers in form of integrated logistics solutions, which is going to enhance growth prospects of our ports. Having presence across the coastline of India is going to be a key factor in this initiative. Our logistics business has seen record growth over the past three years and is well set to capitalize on the logistics boom as we expand our network of warehouses, ICDs and transportation capabilities. Ultimately, as part of our strategy, we want to be a one-stop shop for many of our major customers.Currently, we are focusing on timely completion of our LNG and LPG terminals at Mundra and Dhamra, coastal shipping, container trans-shipment and improvement in operational efficiency by leveraging technology. We are confident that all these initiatives together will help us in reaching our goal. Mundra is today the largest commercial port of the country, handling over 110 mtpa. How do you continue to keep this momentum going given some stiff competition given by government-controlled major ports especially Kandla Port, your closest competitor in terms of traffic and commercial cargo volumes handled?Mundra is our flagship port and a true success story, which has given new goals to the port sector in India. We are expanding capacity at Mundra port and container terminal 4 would be operational soon.Mundra enjoys superior operational efficiencies owing to its investment in evolving commodity-specific infrastructure such as fully mechanized coal import terminal, fertilizer cargo complex and mechanized steel yard, among others. These facilities ensure best service levels at Mundra port. These coupled with our long-term relationships with stakeholders such as shipping lines and key customers are key factors in maintaining long-term competitiveness in the region and the country. More than 65% of our cargo being handled under long-term service contracts with various customers across various cargo types. These advantages continue to help Mundra port grow, which registered a 12% y-o-y growth in 2016-17.In fact, spurt in cargo handling at Tuna Tekra is one of the significant reasons behind the recent cargo growth visible at Kandla port. (Tuna Tekra is a terminal operated by APSEZ and falls under the purview of Kandla Port Trust.)The upcoming LNG and LPG terminals at Mundra port are going to further strengthen the niche position of the port in the market. Having SEZ, DTA and FTWZ create right ecosystem for the port to offer a long-term advantage to our customers. Furthermore, we continue to focus on efficiency improvement through several operational and technological initiatives to increase value-edge. As highlighted, our integrated logistics service offering is going to add further value to our customers, enhancing their convenience and ease of handling logistics through Mundra port and our other ports in India.How do you see your acquisitions in ports? How do you see them fit in your overall growth plans?Our strategy remains on track as we have built out a network of 10 ports all the way from Mundra (in Gujarat) in the west to Dhamra (in Odisha) in the east. The acquisition of the Dhamra port in 2013 has been a huge success from the operational and strategic perspective and we turned around the performance in the very first year. Given the focus on coastal shipping, we should see a further step change in the performance of Dhamra. The port has increased significantly from handling around 10 mtpa cargo to a port targeting to handle around 21 mtpa cargo in 2016-17. It is being envisioned to replicate success of Mundra port for the east coast. We plan to undertake major capacity enhancements at Dhamra port, taking its current capacity from 20 mtpa to 100 mtpa in future.You have also ventured into defence, where you have floated a separate entity. What is happening there?We are in various discussions to enable the Make in India programme, but its too early for me to make any comment.Some time ago, Adani Group got the environmental nod for setting up a shipbuilding yard in Kutch. Can you elaborate on your plans and also if you plan to build ships for the defence sector.Its too early to elaborate on any of these plans. However, there is no plan for us to build ships for the defence sector.What about your plans to enter the financial services sector? There were reports of Adani planning to acquire Macquarie NBFC.This has been done in a private domain by the promoters.There has been quite a buzz about Adani being a debt-heavy company. What is your take on this? As you are aware, infra is a capital-intensive business. At group level, our long-term debt: Ebitda is at a comfortable level of 3.25:1. The corresponding value of net fixed asset is Rs125,000 crore. Overall, for infra business, we are robustly placed.The social sector is being given more focus in the past couple of years with new CSR guidelines in place. What areas is Adani focusing on? The areas that the Adani Foundation focuses on are education, community health, sustainable livelihood and rural infrastructure. Adani Foundations education programmes have already touched the lives of over 150,000 young students, the healthcare programmes touches the lives of over 200,000 people every year, the sustainable livelihood programs have made over 35,000 people and their entire families self-reliant and the rural infrastructure programmes have improved the lives of over 500,000 people across 177 villages by helping provide better roads, drinking water and other basic facilities.What about ventures like real estate, promoted by the family?Adani Realty, our youngest venture, is vigorously expanding its offering of high-quality residential, commercial, affordable and township projects in Mumbai, Gurgaon and Ahmedabad. Our execution is always on track with improving focus on satisfying customer needs and trust. Shantigram is probably one of Indias finest mixed-use townships already. Despite the temporary downturn in the realty sector, you will hear more about Adani Realty and its ambitious growth plans ahead.How do you see the overall Indian economy for industries today under the government at the centre? A lot has been written about your proximity to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. How do you view this?Ultimately, we should let the metrics speak for themselves. India continues to remain the bright spot in the otherwise slowing global economy. It has been and will also be in 2016-17 the fastest-growing major economy, growing at 7.5% as against a global economy that is projected to grow at 3.5%. Today, there is increasing recognition that a large part of the growth is a result of the policies that the government has moved to quickly introduce reforms after coming to power. FDI (foreign direct investment) is a sign of global confidence and FDI over the past 24 months in India has grown 46% and stands at $62 billion, which is an all-time record. In my opinion, we are just getting started and the actual benefits will be realized by the industries over the next decade.The next generation of Adani Group seems to be gearing up for the future. Your elder son Karan Adani was earlier this year appointed as new CEO of APSEZ. How do you see him taking bigger responsibilities?Karan has now been involved in the ports business for over seven years now and I am proud of the way he has developed himself with the strategic and operational role he has played over the years. He has built a well-rounded leadership team who can capitalize on the opportunities in the sector. I am confident that the next phase of expansion that we will see under his leadership will help APSEZ further strengthen its position as a port and port-led development company.",2016-12-19,0v3GPxrwuJA6gebfOMy7iN,"Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani on the Australian coal mine project, plans for the solar power sector and Adani ports along Indias coastline",both,02:36,We aspire to be world leaders with our integrated pit-to-plug strategy: Adani

				The RIL stock has risen 9.5% since 2 September to Rs1,109.35. During this time, the S&P BSE Sensex index has fallen 0.8%.Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds long-awaited commercial launch has reduced the prolonged period of uncertainty that surrounded this venture. While it was clear that RIL was betting big on the telecom sector, there was no clarity on the launch date or  pricing strategy. Both questions have now been answered, and some analysts are excited about the companys prospects of gaining reasonable market share.To be sure, Jios success cant be taken for granted, especially as far as returns from the venture go. In a recent interview, RILs chairman Mukesh Ambani suggested that Jio was targeting a return of 18-19% on capital. That wont be easy to achieve. Analysts from Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd indicate that achieving that would require revenues that are close to market leader Bharti Airtel Ltds; and a similar Arpu (average revenue per user) profile as the top three companies in the sector (around Rs210) at Bharti Airtels subscriber base (250 million). We believe such returns can be difficult to achieve in the first four years, they wrote  in a note to clients on 19 September.But Jio isnt the only reason for the renewed excitement around RIL shares. Benchmark Singapore complex gross refining margins (GRMs) have surged this month. GRM is a measure of profitability for refining firms. According to an analyst, Singapore GRM, the difference between the per barrel price of crude oil and the value of products distilled from it, touched $7 a barrel on Friday. In the June quarter, average GRM was at $5 a barrel. RILs refining business contributed as much as 68% of the companys stand-alone earnings before interest and tax in the June quarter. Additionally, RIL is also expected to benefit from higher light-heavy and lower Brent-Dubai spreads.Besides, analysts expect it to generate high free cash flow (FCF) from 2017-18. RIL is coming out of its capex phase, which in our view will pave the way for a multiyear cycle of strong FCF generation averaging $5 billion per annum over F1Y8-20, implying >11% FCF yield, wrote analysts from Morgan Stanley Research in a report on 25 September. RIL will benefit from the start of earnings delivery from downstream, which we expect to add ~$3.2 billion in Ebitda by FY18, assuming oil prices remain low at $50 a barrel. Ebitda, or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, is an indicator of operating profitability.But note that despite the recent outperformance, investors have lost out considerably from a long-term perspective.  The RIL stock has underperformed the Sensex in the last seven years by a huge margin. Currently, one share trades at 12.6 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year.

				Revenue rose 20% on a 25% growth in volume.In the previous eight quarters, revenue and volume had increased in the range of 2-19%. Strong growth in Latin America helped the company report a robust performance.Late sowing of corn in the region led to sales spill-over from the December quarter. Also, UPLs products for rice, fruits and vegetables performed well in Mexico and Columbia.As a result, operating profit jumped 25%. Margins expanded 90 basis points to 22.6%. According to Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd, this is the companys best ever quarterly margin. The company ended 2015-16 with a revenue growth of 10%. The growth is slower than the 12-17% increase the company saw in the last two fiscals. But the performance should be seen in the context of the demand and currency headwinds that the industry is facing.The global crop protection market is estimated to have contracted 10% in 2015. Brazil, one of the key markets for agrochemical firms, declined 23%. Despite this, UPL has grown revenue, thanks to market share gains.According to Sharekhan Ltd, the management maintained its guidance of 12-15% revenue growth and 60-100 basis points margin expansion in the current fiscal. The growth is expected to be driven by new product launches and market share gains, especially in Latin America.The robust performance and guidance have led to an earnings upgrade. HDFC Securities Ltd and Emkay raised their sales, operating profit estimates for the current fiscal. But Emkay downgraded the stock citing run-up in the share priceits up 15% in the last fiscal. While the gains are not spectacular, weighing on sentiment is the companys renewed focus on capital expenditure. According to Emkay, the company is likely to incur a capex of Rs.800-900 crore per annum for the next couple of years to expand and upgrade capacities. A growing firm like UPL cannot avoid investments. But the fear is that aggressive capex can limit free cash flows and delay the balance sheet improvement measures. Also, it brings back earlier memories of UPL pursuing inorganic growth, which undermined key financial ratios and stock valuations. The coming quarterly results will prove if these concerns are unfounded or not.",2016-05-01,17Oa3YR7VYLS3B1nKpid9H,"The agrochemical firm is likely to incur a capex of ,800-900 crore per annum for the next couple of years to expand and upgrade capacities

				An all-cash deal, the transaction includes Rs.72,800 crore ($10.9 billion) for Essar Oils refining and retail assets, and Rs.13,300 crore ($2 billion) for Vadinar port and related infrastructure. According to one of the sources directly involved in the deal, the total equity value of the deal stands at about $6.4 billion and $6.6 billion as debt approximately.The deal was signed at the Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) summit in Goa in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The funds realised through the deal will be used to settle Essar Group debt, said Prashant Ruia, director, Essar Group at the press meet held in Goa. The Group has a debt of about Rs.80,000 crore that it accumulated in a bid to expand operations and buy steel and oil assets overseas. We will be utilising significant portion of this for debt reduction, Ruia told reporters in Goa. The deal had been in the works since July 2015. Rosneft is worlds largest publicly listed company and will take 49% stake in Essar Oil. Netherlands-based Trafigura Group Pte., one of the worlds biggest commodity trading companies, and United Capital Partners (UCP), a Russian investment fund, will together hold the rest 49% between them. In July, Mint reported that Essar Oil is in talks with oil trading companies including Trafigura Group to sell stake in the company. Investing in EOL, which operates one of the worlds most complex refineries and runs Indias largest private sector retail network, gives the new stakeholders a strong foothold in the Indian market that will witness robust demand growth for petroleum products in the long term. The growth for refined petroleum products in the Indian market for the next five years is expected to be in the 5%-7% range, Essar Oil said in a statement. Vadinar Refinery is Indias second largest refinery contributing 9% of Indias refining output. Essar Oil also operates a pan-India network of 2,700 retail outlets.The closing of the transaction is conditional upon receiving requisite regulatory approvals and other customary conditions. The parties expect to obtain the relevant approvals before the end of the first quarter of 2017, Essar Oil said in a press statement. India allows 100% foreign direct investment in the oil and gas sector. Once the Rosneft deal is officially closed, Essar Oils refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat is likely to begin receiving crude oil from Rosneft. Last July, Essar Oil signed an agreement with Rosneft for supply of 10 million tonnes of crude per annum to the Vadinar refinery in Gujarat for 10 years.This August, Essar Oil had said that it will invest an additional Rs.1,200 crore over the next two-to-three years to upgrade its Vadinar refinery in Gujarat to boost refinery margins by $1.5 per barrel. The company, had also said that it is weighing the option of reviving its petrochemical complex project with an investment of around $1-1.5 billion.The company has already earmarked and acquired land, around 5km away from the refinery, to develop a petrochemical complex that would produce gasoline, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and propylene among other products.Essar Oil which runs a network of 2,700 operating retail outlets, has 2,850 additional outlets in various stages of implementation. Essar Oil has a target of reaching 4,300 operational outlets by the end of FY 2016-17. The total capital investment in these outlets would be about Rs.2,100 crore, which will be mostly infused by franchisees.Arpwood Capital acted as sole advisors to Essar on the transaction.India, consuming 4.3 million barrels per day, is experiencing fastest growing oil consumption in the World right now.

-0.38,"Mindtree Ltds shares have behaved strangely in the past two trading sessions. The company issued a profit warning at the beginning of the week, and it initially seemed that investors more or less shrugged it off, as the shares corrected by only 2.7% on Tuesday. But the next day, after the shares adjusted for a 1:1 bonus issue, Mindtrees valuation fell by as much as 11.5%.
				   
				Some of this is due to the so-called bonus stripping that some high networth individuals engage in, which partly makes it a technical correction. But the companys valuations have also been unusually high for a long time, and so the correction is welcome.Mindtrees statement to investors earlier in the week said that organic revenues will grow only marginally in the March quarter, owing to delays in project starts in the retail and banking, and financial services segments. Based on the companys comments at the time of the December quarter results announcement, the expectation was that growth will be better than the 2.3% it reported for the third quarter. Similarly, while the earlier expectation was that margins will grow, Mindtree has now said that margins will decline.The warning has led to some cuts in earnings estimatesalthough the 14% fall in the companys shares looks a bit overdone. Note that this came after a 5% outperformance vis-à-vis the Nifty IT index in the preceding three trading sessions, which, again, was on account of the bonus stripping opportunity.Bonus stripping involves buying shares just before the ex-date of the bonus issue, and then selling half of the holding at the adjusted ex-bonus share price. In Mindtrees case, it would have involved, for instance, a purchase at Tuesdays price of around Rs.1,550 as the first leg of the transaction. The second leg would involve selling half the number of shares acquired at Tuesdays average price of around Rs.700. The resulting loss of Rs.850 per share can be used to offset short-term capital gains from other transactions. As far as the unsold portion of the portfolio goes, it is typically held for a year to avoid capital gains tax; or in some cases is sold if prices drop beyond a threshold.Perhaps, a large number of such transactions put pressure on Mindtrees shares on Wednesday. Even so, as pointed out earlier, the company enjoyed relatively high valuations, and the correction is welcome. Analysts at Religare Institutional Research said in a note to clients on 8 March, Mindtree is trading at a premium to the sector and to large-caps. While better growth and execution deserve a premium, we think (a valuation of) 17x serves more of an exit multiple for investors in a sector undergoing ROE (return on equity) compression.Besides, after the companys profit warning, expectations on growth would have to be toned down a bit as well.",2016-03-10,1NzTKdPgwV9gWnT6L6vqJN,"The companys valuations have also been unusually high for a long time, and so the correction is welcome

-0.03,"Beijing: Its goodbye China, hello virtual reality (VR) for Hugo Barra. After spending three and half years in Beijing leading smartphone-maker Xiaomi Corp.s global division, Barra is returning to Silicon Valley to head Facebooks VR efforts. 
				   
				He leaves behind an uneven legacy.Barra, 40, was hired in 2013 from Google, where he worked as head of product management for Android, to oversee Xiaomis international expansion. While he helped boost device sales in India, the company aborted a push into Brazil and its other global efforts have largely stalled. At the same time, Xiaomi lost ground in its home market to domestic competitors like Vivo and Oppo, which worked more effectively with retail stores. Barra arrived with an ambitious vision, but failed to predict and overcome rapid changes in the global smartphone market.He did a lot to build up Xiaomis mindshare internationally, said Bryan Ma, vice president for devices research at IDC in Singapore. But when you look at the hard numbers, they show mixed results.Barras surprise exit comes just a couple of weeks after co-founder and CEO Lei Jun said in a letter to employees that the company had recently faced unforgettable challenges and now needed to focus on sustainable growth. After building its success by selling only online, its now developing brick-and-mortar stores in China. Barra declined to comment for this story, but he cited several accomplishments in social media posts as he departed, including the expansion into India and more than 20 other markets. A spokesperson for Xiaomi said Thursday he would continue to advise the company for the indefinite future.When he first moved from sunny California to smoggy Beijing, Barra brought the world spotlight with him. Energetic, globe-trotting, and supremely comfortable commanding a conference-hall stage, the Brazilian-born Barra showed Xiaomi how to introduce its expanding line of products -- which include fitness bands, ear buds, and air filters -- into other countries with a fast-growing middle class.He helped to be that ambassador to the rest of the world, said IDCs Ma. He was that enthusiastic, charismatic guy on stage, who helped explain who this Chinese company was.From 2012 to 2015, Xiaomis smartphone sales rose at a furious clip, expanding more than six-fold, powered by online flash sales and savvy social-media. For parts of 2014 and 2015, Xiaomi ranked first in domestic smartphone sales, and local and international media dubbed the company the Apple of China. When Barra joined, he hoped to translate that success abroad, identifying India and Brazil as key targets. The vision was promising enough that in late 2014, Xiaomi was valued at about $45 billion, the highest for any startup in the world at the time.Yet Xiaomis position at home soon began slipping. Facing intense competition from Vivo, Oppo and other rivals, Xiaomi dropped from first to fourth among smartphone sellers in China. While it focused on online sales, its competitors worked to become more prominent in retail stores, where the vast majority of customers still buy phones. The challenges at home foreshadowed hurdles in other markets.To replicate an e-commerce model from China in India or Indonesia is not as easy as it sounds. Every country has a different internet culture, said Edward Tse, a Hong Kong-based business consultant and author of the book Chinas Disruptors, which described the early days of Xiaomi and other Chinese tech upstarts.By traveling frequently to India -- and chronicling his trips on social media -- Barra helped to build a smartphone business there with $1 billion in annual revenue, an achievement he noted in his farewell Facebook post. Xiaomi is currently ranked third in the Indian smartphone market, with 9 percent market share, according to Counterpoint Research.Hugo spearheaded the idea of how you bring Xiaomi-branded products outside of China, said Gary Rieschel, founding managing partner at Qiming Venture Partners, an early investor in Xiaomi. He works incredibly hard.Barra thanked Lei Jun and Xiaomis fans in his departure post on Facebook. This journey has been nothing short of spectacular in every way, he wrote, and I can proudly say that Xiaomi Global is the first baby I helped bring into the world.Neil Shah, Counterpoints research director in India, thinks Xiaomis performance in India may be near peaking. Theres almost a ceiling about how much you can sell online. Sixty to seventy percent of the markets are offline, he said. For online channels, Xiaomis margins are razor thin, in India and China alike. Chinese rival Vivo, which works closely with retail stores, has already overtaken Xiaomi in India.IDCs Ma says Xiaomis prospects in India look positive for the next year, but after that he isnt so sure. The story in India reflects a lot of what has been happening in China, too. As the market shifts toward offline channels, it favors Oppo and Vivo.According to IDC, India is now Xiaomis dominant overseas market -- accounting for 62 percent of its non-China shipments for the first nine months of 2016. Next up is Myanmar, accounting for 16 percent of shipments. Myanmar is not exactly the first country that comes to mind when you think of the global smartphone market, said Ma.After opening with much fanfare in the summer of 2015, Xiaomis Brazil office closed last year. The companys position in Brazilian smartphone sales peaked in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, with about 1% of the market, according to Tina Lu, head of Counterpoint Research for Latin America. Everything they were selling, they were selling at a loss, she said. Unless you assemble devices locally, you face taxes of about 60 percent. Xiaomi explored, but never finalized, plans to manufacture devices in Brazil.A former employee at Xiaomis Brazil office, which once employed 23 people, said local management struggled to distinguish itself. Beyond the pricing and brand challenges, the outpost had a difficult time coordinating strategy with Beijing, the person said.Replicating Xiaomis early success in developing economies turned out to be elusive -- with obstacles ranging from Brazils heavy taxes on foreign-assembled devices; to patent-infringement lawsuits in India; to the slow adoption of e-commerce in most developing countries compared with China.A lot of people, including myself, once thought that if a Chinese technology company can make it there in China, it can make it anywhere. But I got that wrong, said Clay Shirky, an associate professor at NYU Shanghai and author of the 2015 book on Xiaomi, Little Rice: Smartphones, Xiaomi, and the Chinese Dream.Now Xiaomi will turn greater attention to fighting for its home turf. In his recent letter to employers, Lei Jun admitted the company had lost focus as it attempted rapid expansion, into both new products and countries. Thats why we must slow our pace, and seriously learn from our mistakes, he wrote.Barra isnt the only executive departing amid the slowdown. In October, Chen Tong, a vice-president for content at Xiaomi, left the company to join news platform Yidianzixun. Zhang Jinling, a vice-president managing finance and investments, left to join Baidu Inc. Chen did not respond to a request for comment, and Zhang declined to comment.They had some glory days in the past. One can never count them out, said Tse. But for them to really come back, they need to do a lot of hard work to rebuild the brand. People in China view it now as a declining brand. Bloomberg",2017-01-27,1b62RMQZOeDcrsfVN26CTN,"Hugo Barra had joined Xiaomi with an ambitious vision, but failed to predict and overcome rapid changes in the global smartphone market.",competitor,18:46,"Hugo Barra, in shift to Facebook, leaves behind unfinished expansion at Xiaomi"

But the key questions areis such a premium valuation warranted? Is there more upside left?Analysts have mixed views.Positive aspects of Asian Paints business model are priced in, but the risks of investments in new initiatives are not,  Religare Capital Markets Ltd said in a report.Asian Paints has earmarked overall consolidated capital expenditure of Rs.700 crore for FY17 and is augmenting capacity expansion in Mysuru. Also, it has revised proposed capacity plans for the Vizag unit and is now looking at setting up a plant with a maximum capacity of 0.5 million kilolitres, which will require capex of Rs.1,785 crore.Concurring with that view, Reliance Securities Ltd said that while it expects Asian Paints to deliver double-digit volume growth over the next couple of years, valuations appear to be expensive at current levels. One of the key risks would be a sharp increase in input costs, Reliance Securities cautioned. Raw material prices have seen some uptick in recent months and we need to monitor this trend going forward, the Asian Paints management said in a conference call. On a year-to-date basis, Brent crude oil prices, one of the key ingredients, have risen by 26%.

				On Wednesday, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB)s tariff order increased the companys KG basin pipeline tariff to Rs.45.3 per million British thermal units (mBtu) from a provisional tariff of Rs.5.6 per mBtu. That led to the spike.As Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd pointed out in a note to clients that even though the KG network is one of GAILs smaller networks and accounts for less than 5% volume, this large hike can raise GAILs FY17 earnings by more than 3%.Importantly, investor confidence would increase, that forthcoming tariff orders will also lead to tariff hikes (though not such steep ones), adds the Nomura report. Considering that the pipeline networks useful life (25 years) is ending on 11 February 2017, earlier period adjustments would be taken into account, leading to a sharp tariff hike for the KG network.Despite the recent increase, the GAIL stock is still 6.4% lower so far this fiscal. However, from its yearly low in August, the share price has appreciated by one-third. The renegotiation of Qatars RasGas LNG contract is a key reason for the optimism. Input costs of GAILs petrochemicals business are expected to reduce as LNG prices have been renegotiated at a lower price.As Antique Stock Broking Ltd pointed out, the stabilization of the expanded petrochemicals capacity in the first half of 2016 would lead to higher utilization, which would ensure lower fixed unit operating cost and a higher revenue over FY17-18 for the business. Nevertheless, the sharp decline in petrochemical prices and slow pace of production ramp-up are metrics investors should watch out for. For the nine months to December, the petrochemicals business has posted earnings before tax and interest loss of about Rs.700 crore. Weak realizations and higher input costs are some factors to blame.We have marginally revised up our Ebitda estimates in FY16/FY17 by ~5% building in a) better petrochemicals Ebitda on account of volume ramp-up/ cheaper spot prices b) a pick-up in gas trading segment due to increase in spot volume, said Ambit Capital Pvt.

-0.01,"The Companies Act 2013 requires large (above a specified threshold level) firms to spend 2% of their net profits on corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects. This law came into effect in April 2014. The results on CSR expenditures by firms in the fiscal year 2015-16 were released recently. It is certainly true that Indian firms collectively are more than complying with the CSR law. According to Prime Database, Indian companies spent Rs9,309 crore on CSR projects in 2015-16, which was Rs163 crore more than the amount required by law, and Rs703 crore more than the previous year.
				   
				The general reaction in the Indian press has been positive and suggests that the CSR law has been a success. However, the CSR law is only apparently successful, and in reality is harmful.The problem is that reported expenditure on CSR projects is not a good metric of societal welfare. These numbers overstate the effect of the law. It is not clear whether firms have really increased their CSR spending after the law compared to what they were spending voluntarily before the law, because CSR spending was not well reported historically. There is some evidence that while firms that were initially spending less than 2% increased their CSR activity, but those that were initially spending more than 2% reduced their CSR expenditure. Another possibility is that firms spent money on CSR activities that also lead to increasing firm profits, such as inculcating goodwill and good public relations. There is evidence indicating CSR spending leads to brand building and employee engagement. In that case, firms would have carried out these activities with or without the law. Even if we take the CSR expenditure at face value and assume these are valid numbers, there are still major problems with the CSR law. A required expenditure that does not lead to higher profits is essentially a tax. The CSR law can be viewed as a 2% tax, albeit spent by the firms rather than given to the government. This is a back-door way to increase corporate taxes without a transparent political debate. The corporate tax rate in India is 34.61%already one of the highest, compared to a global average of 24.09%, according to KPMG, an audit and consulting company. Given the emphasis on liberalization and economic growth, it is unlikely that the Indian polity desires an increase in the corporate tax rate. This certainly will not help to make Indian firms more globally competitive nor attract more foreign investment into India.Even to the extent that there has been a real increase in socially beneficial activities, the spending has not gone to democratically determined priorities, but rather to whatever the companies prefer to emphasize. Of the nine different schedules prescribed by The Companies Act, two schedules: combating various diseases and promotion of education accounted for 44% of the total CSR expenditure, while reducing child mortality received no funding and eradicating extreme hunger and poverty received only 6% of the total CSR expenditure. Given that about 50% of children in India are malnourished due to pervasive poverty, it is unlikely that the above allocation of resources reflects the democratic will of the Indian people. It is the governments responsibility to determine high-priority needs of society and target public expenditure in these areas. With the CSR law, the government has abdicated one of its primary functions.There is also an issue of geographic equity. Five states: Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu account for well over one-quarter of all CSR spending. Towards the bottom of the list are Nagaland, Mizoram, Tripura, Sikkim and Meghalayaall from the NorthEast. This, of course, reflects the inclinations, interests, and priorities of the business sector. But, it is the responsibility of the government to help achieve a more egalitarian society.CSR is a controversial idea with many executives, academics and officials on both sides of the issue. Thus, it is not surprising that the Indian law does not clearly define CSR for the purposes of expenditures. The law lists only a few genres of CSR activities: eradicating extreme hunger and poverty, promotion of education, and social business projects. This is much too vague to work as a legal definition. It is not surprising that the law does not even discuss, let alone define, an enforcement mechanism or penalties for non-compliance.The CSR law is inherently contradictory. CSR is fundamentally an inspirational exercise, and it is very difficult to legislate aspirations. Laws only set minimum standards, but do not create an impetus for positive action. For example, it would be difficult to require that companies build excellent schools; the legal requirement can be met merely by spending money on education.Inequality in India, which was already high, has increased even more. The CSR law does not go far enough in reducing inequality and helping the disadvantaged. Without a coercive enforcement mechanism, it is unlikely that the law will result in widespread compliance and real effectiveness. In other words, required CSR will remain largely voluntary, but give the illusion of progress. This is greenwashing on a national scale!India is the first country to require companies to expend resources on CSR. There is sound logic behind why other countries have not done this, and India should not either.

0.1,"Mumbai: Against trillions of rupees of fiscal and tax gains projected from the note ban, a domestic brokerage on Wednesday said the government may gain only Rs72,800 crore from the movetaxes, penalties worth Rs32,800 crore and Rs40,000 crore by way of surplus transfer from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). 
				   
				Many pro-demonetisation economists and analysts had in the early days of the move claimed at least 20% of the Rs15.55 trillion of cancelled money would not come back to the system, which in turn, could enable the RBI to write off that amount from its balancesheet. The profit accretion could then be transferred to the government by the RBI as surplus transfer. While the central bank had publicly cited only Rs15.55 trillion of high value notes were cancelled on 8 November, in an RTI reply to PTI, it had said the actual quantum of bills cancelled was much higher at Rs20.51 trillion. ALSO READ: No records of fake currency deposited in banks: RBIBut according to a report by domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal, this could just be a whimper of the initial projection at Rs40,000 crore, which means only around 3.5% of the cancelled money was not returned to the system or were black money. The brokerage said while RBI has not provided any data on deposited notes after 10 December, calculations using official data on currency in circulation and total supply of bills by 19 December show that over Rs15 trillion has come back to the system. Thus, the RBI could transfer a maximum of Rs40,000 crore to the government, which will be included in the latters non-tax revenue receipts for the next fiscal, the report said. Additional taxes worth Rs32,800 crore and non-tax revenue of Rs40,000 crore will add Rs72,800 crore to the governments kitty next year, it said. But this is based on the broking firms assessment of the cancelled money which came back to the system till 19 December. So far, neither the RBI nor the government has quantified the money that came back to the system. As per the brokerages estimates, the income tax department may be able to unearth only Rs28,500 crore as black money, representing 50% of the income considered to be declared under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana scheme.

0.07,"Davos: Open markets and global trade have been blamed for job losses over the last decade, but global chief executive officers say the real culprits are increasingly machines.
				   
				And while business leaders gathered at the annual World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos relish the productivity gains technology can bring, they warned this week that the collateral damage to jobs needs to be addressed more seriously.From taxi drivers to healthcare professionals, technologies such as robotics, driverless cars, artificial intelligence and 3-D printing mean more and more types of jobs are at risk. Adidas, for example, aims to use 3-D printing in the manufacture of some running shoes.Jobs will be lost, jobs will evolve and this revolution is going to be ageless, its going to be classless and its going to affect everyone, said Meg Whitman, chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise.So while some supporters of Donald Trump and Brexit may hope new government policies will bring lost jobs back to Americas Rust Belt or Britains industrial north, economists estimate 86% of US manufacturing job losses are actually down to productivity, according to the WEFs annual risks report.Technology is the big issue and we dont acknowledge that, Mark Weinberger, chairman of consultancy EY, said on Thursday, arguing there was a tendency to always blame trading partners.The political backdrop is prompting CEOs to take more seriously the challenge of long-life training of workforces to keep up with the exponential growth of technological advances. I think what were reaching now is a time when we may have to find alternative careers through our lifetime, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella told Reuters. Over the last decade, more jobs have been lost to technology than any other factor, and John Drzik, head of global risk at insurance broker Marsh, expects more of the same. That is going to raise challenges, particularly given the political context, Drzik, who helped compile the WEF report, said.Compared to clamping down on immigration by tightening borders, dealing with the impact of technology destroying jobs is something that is perhaps even less easily controlled.For while many advanced technologies remain more expensive than low- or medium-skilled labour in the near term, the shift is likely to accelerate as costs come down.Widening gapTechnological advancements require governments, businesses and academic institutions to develop more educated and highly skilled workforces, executives in Davos said.But this shift to skilled workers also widens the income gap and fuels growing inequality.Jonas Prising, CEO of staffing firm ManpowerGroup, noted that US unemployment is only about 2 to 2.5% among college-educated people but 9 or 10 percent among those with low or no skills.The idea that we would ban automation as part of an evolution within the manufacturing industry, is not really part of the discussion, Prising said. He pointed to policies in countries like Denmark and Italy, where there is a focus on employability of workers.If we dont own responsibility (for the problem of displaced workers), its only going to get bigger, Procter & Gamble Chief Executive David Taylor said.Brawn and brainThe scope of the employment risk from what the WEF calls the fourth industrial revolution which blurs the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres is unclear.A University of Oxford study in 2013 said nearly half of US jobs were at risk, while in 2015 Forrester Research predicted a net loss of only 7% by 2025, as some lost jobs will be replaced with new ones. Forrester predicts that by 2019, one-quarter of all job tasks will be offloaded to software robots, physical robots, or customer self-service automation. Even the corner office may not be safe. CEOs feel reasonably confident we are not going to be replaced by artificial intelligence, Inga Beale, CEO of the Lloyds of London insurance market, said. But Im sure there will be a time! Reuters",2017-01-20,22gKFsmn9CELtWF1yh2pNO,"Technological advancements require govts, businesses and academic institutions to develop more educated and highly skilled workforces, say executives at Davos ",competitor,12:36,Impact of job-stealing robots a growing concern among global CEOs at Davos
1.0,"Bengaluru: Abidali Neemuchwala completes a year on 1 February as Wipro Ltds chief executive officer (CEO). The former Tata Consultancy Services Ltd veteran, who joined Wipro as chief operating officer (COO) in April 2015, remains confident that by the end of March 2018, Wipro will be able to come back to industry-matching growth.
ALSO READ | Wipro revenue forecast underlines IT industrys challengesOver his 20 months at Wipro, Neemuchwala, who is based in Dallas, has focused on simplifying internal processes, worked on organization alignment to improve execution, embraced hyper automation and adopted an aggressive mergers and acquisitions approach. The measures have helped Wipro marginally improve upon the 3.7% dollar revenue growth recorded in 2015-16, which is  expected to grow at-best 5% in the year ending March. Edited excerpts from an interview:Three full quarters as CEO, and you have embarked on a journey by articulating six broad themes. Given these measures you have started, the management has said in the past that a complete turnaround will take time. Will it be fair to ask if the company can come back or say end March 2018 with industry-matching growth or Nasscom-projected growth numbers? How would you describe this quarter?Operationally, it was a good quarter. Our profitability improved in a quarter where there are furloughs and fewer working days. But I think in revenue growth we could have done more. But core business is doing well. India and Middle East business restructuring (had an impact) and Appirio (acquisition) closing also took time. So these things aside, Im very confident that Wipro is progressing well and I believe three-four quarters is a reasonable time frame (when we will come back to Industry-leading growth). You need all cylinders to be firing for industry-leading growth and that is what Im focusing on. One criticism of your 20-month stint, first as COO and then the 10 months as CEO, is that you have shied away from taking tough decisions when it comes to making or appointing leaders. Analysts believe you have continued with the same set of leaders. One of the things which is part of my nature is that we dont advertise tough decisions. As a CEO, you take tough decisions all the time. About 40% of my current leadership team, from direct reporting structure, is not what I inherited from T.K. Kurien. We have new leadership where ever it is required. (What) Im also very sensitive about is that whenever these changes happen, we do it very respectfully and consciously. So we dont make changes for the heck of making changes. In fact, I feel very good that if you as a journalist dont see this change, then customers also dont see this change. And this is the best thing for us. Remember, we have had a very smooth CEO transition, or rather the smoothest in the industry. Do you think there is a lot of noise on visa regulation in the US and Indian companies dependence on visas is actually coming down?Absolutely. The industry, including Wipro, has learnt to hire globally, many more local employees. Rebadged a lot of employees from our customers. Today I guide my hiring managers that dont make overseas job posting as an attraction. That era is over. So today I tell young talent that if you want to do great digital and path breaking and domain focused work, join Wipro. So dependence on visa has absolutely come down over the last few years. And so it is not that much of a worry because we believe that all business friendly decisions will be taken by the US government. What are say two challenges ahead of you, as you start calendar year 2017?Strategically, we have to future-proof our organization. So execution here will be key. Our exposure to telecoms and energy in the past had its impact. So balancing the whole portfolio takes time. We have to configure our business that we are diversified enough so that cyclical changes do not have more than impact.Now India and Middle East is creating new opportunities. Historically, we have had challenges. So we plan to complete in two quarters. So we hope to complete by Q1 of next financial year.

				We will be selecting sites very soon that we will reserve for our first nuclear energy power plant, Khalid Al-Falih, the countrys energy minister, said Wednesday at the Oil and Money conference in London. We hope within the next 12 months that we will be announcing concrete plans. The government wants to make sure all regulatory steps are taken beforehand, he said. Wind and solar power will also play a very significant part of Saudi Arabias energy mix, Al-Falih said. Saudi Arabia, which laid out its ambitions for diversifying energy supplies in 2012, is trying to reduce the economys dependence on hydrocarbons as low oil prices strain the budget. The country raised $17.5 billion this week in the biggest bond sale from an emerging-market nation as it seeks to bridge a deficit that widened last year to about 15 percent of gross domestic product.UAE ReactorsThe kingdom has a target of generating 6 to 7 gigawatts of electricity from nuclear power by 2032, rising to 17 gigawatts by 2040, Maher al-Odan, an adviser to the government on renewables planning, said in April of last year. Abu Dhabi in the neighboring United Arab Emirates is building the Gulf Arab regions first nuclear power plant. The reactor, one of four that the emirate is planning, is scheduled for completion in 2017. Emirates Nuclear Energy Corp. and Korea Electric Power Corp. signed a joint-venture agreement on Thursday for a long-term partnership in the U.A.E.s nuclear program, ENEC said in an e-mailed statement. Korea Electric is taking an 18 percent stake in a venture representing the commercial interests of the U.A.E.s Barakah nuclear-plant project, with ENEC holding the rest, according to the statement. Construction of the U.A.E.s four reactors is more than 71 percent complete, and all the plants are to be finished in 2020, ENEC said. The U.A.E., like Saudi Arabia, a fellow member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, is trying to reduce its reliance on oil exports.

				CDPQ, which set up its India office in March, has announced $850-million capital for power projects in India, and investments in Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd and in TVS Logistics Services Ltd.In an interview, Anita Marangoly George, managing director (South Asia) at CDPQ, comments on the present scenario in India and the pension funds investment plans.Edited excerpts:Limited partners (LPs) have complained about under-performance of Indian PE and have decided to do investments directly. Do you believe direct investment is a good option for large investors like CDPQ?Weak PE returns is not an issue that is intrinsic to India alone and is not the sole reason why the LPs are interested in direct investments.There is a renewed interest in the way LPs are looking at the India story which is driven by the fundamentals of the Indian economy. As LPs get to know the opportunities and the partners in different sectors, they are more comfortable investing directly. Other reasons could include economic considerations on saving carry (carried interest) and fees; better governance in terms of flexibility and exercising more control on investment decisions and how they deploy capital; and scaling up internal capabilities are just a few reasons why the LPs are going the direct route. For long-term investors like CDPQ, it is also important to consider the timing of entering a new market and the exit where institutional investors may have a different time horizon relative to PE funds. Last, but not the least, in a long-term relationship, the quality of the local partner is vital to us.How does CDPQ see India as an investment destination as compared to the other Asian markets?Indias story is ultimately not just about the growth rates, its about potential that rests on economic fundamentals. First, the labour force, its one of the most attractive in the world, young and growing at a remarkable rate. Over 10 million new entrants a year are expected over the next decade. Second, Indias governanceno doubt, there is a new tone on the top on this issue and progress is being made. A stable and principled system of public and corporate governance is a prerequisite for investor confidence and for long-term, sustainable growth.Third, Indias structural reforms that are gradually changing will make India a more competitive player in the global economy and better equip it for future growth.Which sectors are attractive ones for CDPQ in India?Thinking long-term, thinking like a business owner, are opportunities we believe are key. We are particularly keen on themes like  financial services, renewables, real estate, healthcare, and transport and logistics. Fintech (financial technology) is reshaping the landscape of financial serviceshow they are delivered and who delivers them. With renewables, we identify that India will need more power and has the opportunity to develop it in a way that keeps its cities liveable and potentially provide a competitive advantage. Transportation and logistics is critical to create a common market to create and build the transportation logistics capabilities required to move goods efficiently.How do you see Indias growth in ICT sector? And potential for investments?Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) is one of the fastest growing parts of Indias economy and the largest private employer in the country. Over the next five years, it is estimated that at least 33% more citizens will gain access to the Internet,  and the number of smartphone users will grow to 700 million or more by 2025, from 200 million last year. All of these open the door to a world of connectivity, knowledge and opportunity. But what really matters is Indias long history of entrepreneurship and innovation. Today, India ranks as the second-most important ICT start-up hub in the world and ICT is remaking the global economy, disrupting businesses and business models every day. Which means India stands near the forefront of an industry with the power to drive change, create jobs and shape the future of business here and around the world.",2016-10-21,2JigqxCrpaCZwaGVPwJIbP,CDPQ managing direct (South Asia) Anita Marangoly George comments on the present scenario in India and the pension funds investment plans,competitor,00:31,Renewed interest in the way LPs are looking at India: Anita Marangoly George

Outages in several key producing countries such as Canada and Nigeria are responsible for the recent spike in prices.While the recent strength in prices augurs well, its not as if the outlook over a medium-term perspective has turned particularly bright. We do expect some improvement in global supply-demand balance for crude oil over the next two years, said a report from Kotak Institutional Equities Research on Tuesday. They forecast global crude oil price at $50 a barrel for FY2017 and $55 a barrel for FY2018, according to the report.For now, lower crude oil prices have meant disappointing net price realizations for the quarter gone by. ONGC and OILs net realizations came in at $34.88 a barrel and $32.62 a barrel, respectively. Further, the production performance wasnt impressive either. ONGCs crude oil production fell 2% year-on-year while its gas production declined at a faster pace of 10%. Sure, OILs gas production increased 8% year-on-year but it has declined 7.5% compared with the December quarter. OILs crude oil production declined both sequentially as well as compared with the year ago period.Shares of both companies have understandably lagged the benchmark Sensex in the past year owing to low prices. Currently, ONGC and OIL stocks trade at 11 times and 10 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year, respectively. What of the future? Says Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt.

0.43,"This week, India finally gave up its decades-old claim on the 106-carat Kohinoor diamond, which lies in the Tower of London, guarded by Yeoman Warders  and sometimes adorns the crown of the British monarch. Or so it seemed.
				   
				The legal arguments made by the Indian governmentarising from one more court petition seeking the return of the diamondwere distinctly odd. First it was claimed that the diamond was given as voluntary compensation to the British for the expenses they bore in the Anglo-Sikh war.That is a very strange reading of history. For history shows that give and take occurs between equals. Otherwise, its one or the other.It is likely that the fabulous piece of Indian diamond was presented by Maharaja Duleep Singh, son of the great warrior king Ranjit Singh and all of eight years old, to Queen Victoria in 1850, but not personally. Amid criticism even in those politically incorrect times, governor general Lord Dalhousie wrote to a friend in 1849, My motive was simply this: that it was more for the honour of the Queen that the Koh-i-noor should be surrendered directly from the hand of the conquered prince into the hands of the sovereign who was his conqueror than it should be presented to her as a giftwhich is always a favourby any joint stock company among her subjects.By any joint stock company he meant the East India Company. This week, after raising a predictable storm, the government told the Supreme Court of its resolve to make all possible efforts to bring back the Kohinoor diamond in an amicable manner The government has not conveyed its views to the court, contrary to whats being misrepresented.Solicitor-general Ranjit Kumar told a bench led by chief justice T.S. Thakur that if we start claiming the treasures from the museums of other countries, they will claim their treasures from our museums. There will be nothing left in our museums. To which, a clearly unimpressed Thakur informed the government lawyer that India has never been a colonial power. We have not colonized any other country and taken out their artefacts. What are you worried about?Ranjit Kumar then agreed that the foreign artefacts that are in Indian museums are gifts.The arguments are expected to conclude in the days to come. Is it Indian government policy to seek the return of the Kohinoor? Previous attempts by India soon after Independence and in 1953, joined by Pakistan in 1976, were rebuffed by the British as non-negotiable.Thakur stopped short of dismissing the petition on the understandable grounds that if the court does so, it will obviously nullify any future Indian claim on the Kohinoor.Hopefully, the Indian government will spell out its case clearly once and for all. It only makes sense because the UK has told not just India, but also other countries such as Greece, that the artefacts that have ended up in the UK arent going anywhere soon.Prime Minister David Cameron couldnt have put it more clearly on a visit to India: If you say yes to one, you suddenly find the British Museum would be empty. I am afraid to say, it is going to have to stay put.However, the petitionera non-governmental organizationdoesnt just want the Kohinoor. It wants the treasures of Tipu Sultan, Bahadur Shah Zafar, Rani of Jhansi, Nawab Mir Ahmad Ali Banda and other rulers of India.Tipu? Would that include the sword of the famous Indian warrior king? No, because that would be the one that was purchased in an auction for £175,000 and returned to India by businessman Vijay Mallya. This delicious irony escaped neither the judge nor petitioner.The gentleman who bought the sword has left the country, the government attorney informed the chief justice, prompting the judge to askjokingly, we are toldwhether the United Breweries chairman had taken the sword with him.Mallyas return to Indiato face debtors whom his grounded Kingfisher Airlines owes around Rs.9,000 crore ($1.3 billion)is another matter on which India has to spell out its stand. Indian investigative agencies most certainly want him back, but they face the acute embarrassment of having to answer why they allowed him to leave the country in the first place.There is one point of view that the member of the Rajya Sabha should return voluntarily. But I know of no one who has returned to India voluntarily from the UK to face the law. Instead, what always happens is that the UK courts take over once India places its request for the UK to extradite someone (that person needs to be charged in an Indian court first).This is because a person who is resident in the UK has the legal right to fight attempts to extradite them. The government case is usually led by the home minister, who can write to the court stating the government position seeking a persons extradition. But it is up to the courtand not the governmentwhether to accept Indias request or not.Mallya, who returned Tipus sword to India, may not be quite so ready to return himself. As to the Kohinoor, there is absolutely nothing wrong with great Indian artefacts and other objects being displayed in foreign museums as long as the circumstances of their acquisition are correctly explained, a historical contextualization that will take Indian sensitivities into account. Think of the hundreds of millions of people who have been able to marvel at and enjoy the Indian objects of art and history stored and displayed in the museums of London, New York and Paris.

				Titans revenue fell marginally by 0.1% to Rs2,659.83 crore during the period.In April, Titan announced a voluntary retirement scheme for employees who had either finished 10 years of service or were above 40 years of age in a bid to improve productivity and cut costs. The move appears to have paid off in terms of profit growth.Gross margins were very good during the quarter. We are at 42% studded ratio and that added to the margin substantially. Another fact is also that in plain gold jewellery our margins were significantly higher thanks to the higher gold prices, senior executives at Titan including CEO (jewellery) C.K.

				The withdrawal of Rs500 and Rs1,000 denomination notes is expected to lead to a freeze in property transactions, significant cash flow issues, slower project approvals and softer prices.The move has led to considerable panic in the real estate sector that was already caught in a three-year-old slowdown. Transaction volumes are expected to come to a standstill, and developers are worried about short-term cash flows. Receivables from customers are likely to get delayed and cancellation of bookings may happen because buyers or investors may rethink as asset prices are likely to go down, said Rajeev Bairathi, executive director and head of capital markets at Knight Frank India.Cash forms a major component in most transactions in the real estate sector such as land purchases, procuring approvals from government departments or civic bodies, selling homes or plots of land and paying contractor and architect bills.To be sure, the initiative to eliminate black money aims to rid the real estate sector of corruption and lack of transparency but in the short term it is sure to add to the pain.Purchasing of land and all real estate transactions are going to be impacted. People used to park money in cash and cheque in a certain ratio, but there is going to be restriction on that, said Avneesh Sood, director, Eros Group, a Delhi-based realty firm. The number of people who want to purchase may drop and hence, sales may drastically drop. Property markets such as National Capital Region (NCR), which is mainly investor-driven and Tier II and III cities, where also cash plays a major role in transactions, are expected to be more impacted than others, property analysts said.NCR real estate developers would be the worst hit, followed by Mumbai and Bengaluru. Sales will go down dramatically and most may have to reduce prices, said a property analyst, who did not want to be named. In smaller property markets such as Surat, Ludhiana or Kochi, the difference between the Ready Reckoner rates and market value of property is wide, much more than say, Mumbai. Developers often tend to sell the properties based on the ready reckoner value, and charge the remaining amount in cash. Ready Reckoner rates are residential and commercial rates for a given area published every area by the state government. We suspect land deals will not happen for the next six months in the state. But most developers in the state have started streamlining their businesses and putting processes in place because of RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Act) which is being implemented, said Vijay Shah, promoter of Ahmedabad-based Vijay Builders Pvt. Ltd.  On Wednesday, the BSE Realty Index fell 10.23%, its steepest fall since 24 August 2015, to close at 1,324.75 points -- a level last seen on 4 May. Shares of DLF Ltd closed down 17.47% at Rs118.55 a share on the BSE, their steepest fall since 14 October 2014. Indiabulls Real Estate fell 18.51%, the steepest fall since 7 January 2009, to close at Rs65.60 a sharea level last seen on 28 April.Land deals had become speculative, because investors in residential diverted to land and office projects, when residential fared badly. The land economy thrives on cash and that is set to change. The move will also disrupt the smaller property markets, which also involve a lot of cash dealings. But in the long term, this will be a game changer for the sector, said Sanjay Dutt, chief executive, India operations, Ascendas-Singbridge India.Not just sales and prices, the cash network is deeply entrenched in the system through the approval process that every project has to go undergo.Rohit Poddar, managing director of Mumbai-based Poddar Developers Ltd said bureaucrats who take money in cash will face challenges. ...There might be a scenario where approvals may not happen on time. The maximum impact will be seen through land transactions and on the approval side, he said. In the long term, this is likely to bring more consolidation in the sector, where a large number of smaller, unorganized developers may cease to operate and the established firms may get stronger and hopefully, more transparent. Knight Franks Bairathi said foreign institutional funding in real estate will go up as a result, as risks concerning a parallel economy and cash transactions decrease.  Diwali sales were subdued under recessionary conditions, and business has dropped for many. Despite the immediate negative sentiment, consolidation is bound to happen. At least 40-50% of companies who are involved in real estate development, may stop business, said M.R.

-0.43,"New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modis drive to give liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) connections to the poor without upfront charges is gaining the scale of a flagship entitlement scheme akin to the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGA) piloted by the previous Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government.
				   
				The Ujjwala scheme of distributing clean cooking fuel to women in poor households launched in May by Modi is set to cross 1 crore connections this week, with states in the east, north-east and hilly regions being the biggest beneficiaries, a person involved in implementing the scheme said on condition of anonymity.Poll-bound Uttar Pradesh is the largest beneficiary state with 34 lakh poor women getting the connection, followed by states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Odisha.Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Jharkhand and the north-eastern states too have got priority status under the scheme with no cap on the number of connections to be issued. Members of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and minorities are the major beneficiaries of the scheme.Interestingly, while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had performed well in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar, the party wants to consolidate its position in states like Odisha and make further inroads into the north-east which together comprise 25 Lok Sabha seats. The BJP is in power in Assam. It also partners government in Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh. Similarly, West Bengal and Odisha remain crucial for the BJP because the two states together control 63 Lok Sabha seats.Jammu & Kashmir is also a priority area for the BJP where it had won seats in Jammu and Ladakh regions, while the party continued its dismal performance in the Kashmir valley where it drew a blank. The performance was repeated in December 2014 when BJP won seats in Jammu but didnt open an account in the Valley.The steps taken by the NDA is also crucial because the BJP leadership hopes to play a decisive role in the assembly elections in states like Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarkhand, Uttar Pradesh and north-eastern states in the next two years.States are given priority status if LPG use is less than the national average of 61% of households. Geographically and economically-challenged states received priority as LPG access has been less in those regions.Our target for the current financial year is 1.5 crore connections. We have already cleared applications more than that and are working towards releasing all of that shortly. In a day or two, we will cross the one crore mark, explained the person quoted above.To make sure that all the households that are given connections get easy refills, oil companies Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd are adding the number of distributors.This year, the companies added 300 distributorships and more than 1,600 applications are being processed. Companies have also identified 400 locations for new distributors in Uttar Pradesh.The drive to promote LPG as a clean cooking fuel is altering the countrys energy mix resulting in higher import of LPG and sufficient kerosene for industrial purposes as well as for exports. The drive is also part of a strategy to veer the country towards a gas-based economy in light of the climate change action plan. According to Kalpana Jain, senior director, Deloitte in India, how well gas is absorbed in the economy is a function of infrastructure available to take the fuel to the consumption points.",2016-11-08,2nt93vv6XFKV6xfaBTJYiK,"Poll-bound UP is the largest beneficiary state with 34 lakh poor women getting the connection, followed by states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Odisha",both,10:26,Modis Ujjwala scheme set to cross 1 crore mark this week

Bloated with bad loans, state-owned banks require Rs.1 trillion in the near term, estimate brokerage firms and rating agencies. The government, on the other hand, has allotted only Rs.25,000 crore for this year under its so-called Indradhanush programme.
				   
				Consider this statistic: In the December quarter alone, banks posted a cumulative loss of Rs.10,911 crore, which is slightly over two-fifths of governments proposed capital infusion. Credit Suisse estimates that unprovided problem loans are now at 65-200% of public sector banks capital.The capital requirement will grow further as most banks are yet to recognize some more bad loans. The chart shows how badly banks need capital. Overall, estimated capital requirement for the banking system is between Rs.2.5 trillion and Rs.3 trillion over the next four years compared with the governments promise of Rs.70,000 crore.Clearly, given its fiscal constraints the government may not be able to cough up any huge amount upfront, especially after the Seventh Pay Commission and 14th Finance Commission recommendations. The solution to the bad loan problem, which will free up cash for banks and enable them to accumulate it out of profits, lies in policy measures.A comprehensive bankruptcy code was promised in the last budget; it is in the works and yet to become law. Another idea that has taken hold in recent times is the creation of a bad bank, some version of the USs Troubled Asset Relief Programme after the 2008 crisis. This would be a sovereign-backed asset reconstruction company. But that doesnt save taxpayers from taking a hit as someone would have to make good those losses. It also creates a moral hazard as banks arent made liable for their past bad decisions.Of course, the government can reduce its stake below 51% in public sector banks. It can always bring down its stake to 33% while still keeping voting rights intact. The big concern here is cheap valuations currently and hurdles from bank unions and accusations of selling the family silver.

0.25,"San Francisco: Alphabet Inc. reported better-than-expected revenue thanks to a fast-growing cloud-computing business and booming YouTube video advertising, but the taxman spoiled the party. 
				   
				Fourth-quarter revenue, after payments for online traffic from distribution partners, was $21.2 billion, up 23% from a year earlier, the company said in a statement on Thursday. Profit before certain items was $9.36 a share. Analysts on average expected sales of $20.6 billion and profit per-share of $9.63, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The earnings miss was mostly caused by a one-time tax payment that pushed the tax rate to 22% from a 5% rate a year earlier. Chief financial officer Ruth Porat called it a discrete item, but didnt elaborate on a conference call.Excluding that, Google would have reported $10.13 a share in the latest period, according to Ken Sena, an analyst at Evercore ISI. Alphabet shares still fell in extended trading, which Sena attributed to high expectations and gross profit margins that slipped to 76% from 78%. The stock touched a record $861 on Thursday before closing at $856.98.It was a good quarter revenue wise, but margins were a little light because some of the strongest revenue growth came from licensing and other business that are less profitable, Sena said. Alphabets Google unit has been investing heavily in its cloud offerings, trying to catch market leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. All three are investing heavily in what is a booming business. On Thursday, Microsoft said cloud revenue almost doubled in its latest quarter.Alphabets capital expenditure reached $3.1 billion during a quarter, a 46% increase from a year earlier. Executives said some of this went toward facilities and infrastructure, including computer servers and data centers to support the companys online advertising business and cloud services. This spending paid off. Googles Other revenue line, which includes cloud computing, jumped 62% to $3.4 billion. This segment also includes sales from its app store and hardware devices.On the conference call, Alphabet said more investment in cloud is coming this year. Porat said most of the 2,100 additional employees hired in the fourth quarter joined the cloud business.Everywhere I look at, we are establishing a world-class enterprise team, Google chief executive officer Sundar Pichai said on the call. I definitely think were going to have a great year.The executives also highlighted YouTube, with Pichai saying revenue from the online video service continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by skippable TrueView ads, which marketers only pay for if viewers keep watching.While spending rose during the quarter, Alphabet was more frugal with its more experimental Other Bets, like self-driving cars and health care. These businesses generated $262 million in fourth-quarter revenue, up from $150 million a year earlier.

				The report, authored by Sreenidhi Srinivasan and Namrata Mukherjee, research fellows at Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy, analysed the current rules and norms in place for data protection.At a time when India is seeking to develop as a digital economy, it is imperative to have in place an effective regime for protection of personal information, the report said. India is pushing digital (and cashless) transactions, some linked to the biometrics-based Aadhaar number which has been assigned to around a billion Indians by the Unique Identification Authority of India.ALSO READ | Indias privacy non-lawThe paper compared the Indian data protection regime with  international ones and found it lacking on several counts. The paper identified a lack of a statute expressly recognizing privacy rights of an individual and rights over their personal data, especially in an interplay with non-state actors and firms. The Vidhi paper enumerated important components of a robust data protection regime: entities required to comply with data protection norms; the kind of information to be protected; consent for collecting information; and the individuals right to access his or her information held by another organization. The 77-page report also provided a framework for management of personal data, which could serve as a model for a data protection statute or be assimilated in the IT Rules.ALSO READ | Sustaining transition to a digital economyThe paper argued for extension of data protection to all personal data and not merely sensitive personal data (the first includes passwords, financial information, health conditions, medical history, sexual orientation, biometric information). It also suggested seeking consent of individuals before collecting all personal information. Rahul Matthan, partner at Trilegal and a Mint columnist appreciated the work done by Vidhi on data protection, but says hed like a model of data protection more suited to the Indian context. Their approach seems to be to analyse the way international statutes have been written and try to see whats appropriate in the Indian context.

				In fact, the refining business was expected to perform well thanks to a better refining operating environment, as the Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) had improved sequentially. Sure, the companys GRM improved to $10.8 a barrel from $10.1 a barrel in the September quarter but fell short of the expectations of many analysts. For instance, Kotak Institutional Equities and Nomura Research were expecting the measure at $11.3 a barrel and $11.5 a barrel, respectively. RILs premium over benchmark Singapore GRM at $4.1 per barrel is also the lowest in the past three quarters.Even as the petrochemicals business performed well with its Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) increasing 30% from a year earlier, the fact that RILs key business segment hasnt performed as expected is disappointing. Refining business Ebit accounted for almost two-thirds of the companys total Ebit in the quarter. The domestic oil and gas business posted a loss at the Ebit level, due to lower price realizations and lower volumes. The organized retail business has performed well but the segment is relatively small to have a meaningful overall impact.What of the stock? The RIL stock has underperformed the benchmark Sensex index so far this fiscal year. But its worth noting that the share price has appreciated about 16% from its closing low of Rs930 seen on 23 May 2016. Currently, one RIL share trades at 11 times estimated earnings for the next fiscal year. The refining environment continues to remain strong but is already known to investors and may not be enough to override their other concerns.RILs outstanding debt has increased to Rs1,94,381 crore as on 31 December from Rs1,89,132 crore as on 30 September. During the same time frame, cash and cash equivalents declined to Rs76,339 crore from Rs82,533 crore. That could be a concern, according to independent analyst S.P. Tulsian, who said, I believe this is mostly on account of increase in telecom capex, a business from which there is no clarity on revenue or Ebitda from a near-term perspective. The market is not going to react positively due to concerns on negative cash flows and unimpressive profit growth of refining, its core and main business segment, says Tulsian. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.Of course, all eyes will be on the performance of the telecom business. The company has recently expressed confidence saying that it will prove the financial communitys scepticism wrong with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds performance. The year 2017 will see a test of this optimism as Jio turns into a paid service, said CLSA in a report on 2 January.This year will also see stabilization of RILs downstream projects. Analyst expectations of incremental Ebitda from these projects remain markedly below guidance of $3bn-3.5bn, points out CLSA. The low expectations give room for surprise to the upside, added the report. The stock thus is likely to take cues from a combination of telecom and downstream projects news flow, which is where investor attention will also be focused in fiscal year 2018.",2017-01-17,343YGLUtdxSMgy0SZVbXEM,Reliance Industriess GRM improved to $10.8 a barrel from $10.1 a barrel in the September quarter but fell short of the expectations of many analysts,both,00:36,RILs refining business fails to wow in Q3

				Prahlad, a relative of Infosys founder N.R. Narayana Murthy, will now be one of the five members of the current NRC, according to two executives familiar with the development; the decision may make it more difficult for the management to award higher salaries to its senior executives. Infosyss nomination and remuneration panel is headed by independent director and professor Jeffrey Lehman, and includes three independent directors: Biocon chairman and managing director Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw,  Stanford University provost John Etchemendy and non-executive chairman R. Seshasayee.An Infosys spokesperson declined to comment. The induction of Prahladwhose appointment as independent director in October did not go down well with proxy advisory firmsinto the NRC is significant for two reasons.Firstly, Murthy publicly expressed unhappiness last year with the boards decision to increase CEO Vishal Sikkas compensation to $11 million a year from the earlier $7.08 million. In April, only 23.57% of promoter votes were cast in favour of a resolution reappointing Sikka as managing director and CEO and increasing his compensation by 55% to $11 million a year. With Prahlad, also a former employee of the company, on the NRC, Infosys will find it challenging to further increase Sikkas compensation.Finally, Sikkas revised compensation of $11 million includes $4 million to be paid in cash and $7 million in stock. The $4 million cash component includes a base pay of $1 million and $3 million performance-based pay. The $7 million stock compensation includes $2 million to be paid over the year and $5 million in stock to be based on the companys performance in a year. For the current year, Infosys has already paid Sikka $2 million in stock.The Infosys board has linked Sikkas $11 million compensation to the progress the company makes in becoming a $20 billion firm by March 2021. However, Infosys does not disclose the annual targets based on which Sikka will be awarded the $8 million variable or performance-based pay. For the current year, Infosys expects at-best 7.6% dollar revenue growth, which is lower than last years growth of 9.1%, and with Prahlads induction in the NRC, many believe Sikka will not get the entire component of the variable pay. I dont think the board will now be that bold or brave enough to again increase the CEOs compensation, said a senior Infosys executive on condition on anonymity. Now with Prahlad on the remuneration and nominations committee, Murthy will have some say in how CEO will be paid the variable pay for this year.A proxy advisory firm again flagged concerns about Prahlads appointment, this time on the NRC. First, Infosys should have made this disclosure of this appointment of D.N. Prahlad on the NRC.

-0.41,"Vodafone India Ltds June quarter results suggest competitive pressures eased in the voice segment for the mobile services industry; although the data segment continues to struggle for growth.The company said last week, Voice revenues returned to growth as competition eased, although the 2.2% year-on-year growth in June is nothing to get too excited about. Revenues were flat in the March quarter.Data revenue grew by 22%, year-on-year (y-o-y), down from 35% in the March quarter and as high as 65% just a year ago. Nevertheless, its heartening to note that the company has taken some steps to spur growth. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, data volume grew by 6.5%, up from a mere 0.7% growth in the March quarter.In the fourth quarter of the last fiscal, some companies such as Idea Cellular Ltd and Vodafone had reduced promotions in the market, which had resulted in slightly better price realizations, but had hit growth. There seems to have been a reversal in strategy in the June quarter. Its likely ldea, too, may report a bounceback in data growth sequentially.Of course, the key is for this growth to sustain. As things stand, the incumbents in the sector seem to be content upgrading existing users to 3G and 4G services. The total number of data users has more or less stagnated at Vodafone India. They have grown by only 4% in the past one year. The only reason data volume is growing at a faster pace is that a much larger proportion of users have shifted to 3G/4G services, where consumption is about three-to-four times higher, compared with 2G data services (see chart). Of course, theres a limit to how much the data segment can grow with this strategy.This month, Bharti Airtel Ltd, Idea and Vodafone increased data benefits in an attempt to get subscribers to increase usage. But such a strategy is unlikely to provide a breakthrough in attracting new data customers.As such, it seems like it will only be after Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds launch that data prices will crash meaningfully enough to attract new users. Until then, the incumbents seem content to coast along as far as volumes and revenues go. Its important to note that despite sluggish volumes and a drop in price realizations, they have managed to maintain (in some cases, even improve) profit margins and generate large amounts of cash. Vodafone Indias profit margins stood at 28% two years ago, and are at over 29% now. Avoiding a mad rush for volume growth looks like a sane choice after all.",2016-07-25,3yLNXVt9kLeUIx2XURqvJJ,"It seems like it will only be after Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds launch that data prices will crash meaningfully enough to attract new users

0.04,"Last month, The Economist published a story on the Tata group with the title Mistrys Elephant, where the magazine compared the conglomerate to a ponderous pachyderm.
				   
				In what now appears to be a remarkably prescient remark, the magazine said, That the revered Mr (Ratan) Tata still chairs the Trusts that bear his name may make it trickier for Mr (Cyrus) Mistry to be his own man.Was Mistrys performance so bad that he had to be removed? The Street seems to think otherwise.One obvious yardstick is the market capitalization of the group. On 1 January 2013, soon after Mistry took charge, the market capitalization of listed companies of the Tata group was Rs4.97 trillion. On Monday, when the decision was announced, the market capitalization stood at Rs8.71 trilliona massive 75% higher in less than four years.The Tata groups increase in market capitalization beats benchmarks such as the Nifty, which has risen 47% and big groups such as Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) with a market capitalization growth of 27% in the same period. Of course, one cannot ignore the market cap of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), one of the groups premium firms that spews  cash, alone is higher than that of RIL. And it does paper over the fact that many of the group companies are not doing so well. But, on key return ratios such as return on equity, the groups leading firms are on par with peers. As far as revenue goes, compounded revenue growth between FY13 and FY16 of TCS, Tata Motors Ltd (led by Jaguar Land Rover Plc) and even Indian Hotels Corp. Ltd have outperformed their peers.ALSO READ | Cyrus Mistry removed as Tata Sons chairman, Ratan Tata returnsYes, there were some bad eggs in the basket. For instance, Tata Steel Ltds acquisition of European steel giant Corus was sinking under its own weight. But its performance has perhaps more to do with the severe cyclical downturn in commodities, with global players bleeding and shutting down plants.Tata Docomo likewise was caught in a long-drawn and bitter legal tussle, the genesis of which predated Mistrys taking charge.If anything, media reports suggest Mistry was trying to put the vast and diversified conglomerate in order. He put Coruss steel assets in the UK on the block and took firm steps to sell off assets of the non-performing businesses of Indian Hotels and Tata Chemicals. There were also reports that he was telling managers to pull up their socks. At the Tata Motors annual general meeting on 9 August, Mistry was reported to have said, I think the journey is going to be long and not for the faint-hearted.ALSO READ | Uneasy lies the Tata crownIn any case, analysts and industry experts say that four years is too short a time period to judge Mistrys performance by or even compare it with that of Ratan Tata, who was at the helm unfettered for three decades. It may also be a trifle unfair to hold Mistry responsible as chairman for the weak performance of some of the companies in his group, considering that he inherited massive problems.Clearly, Mistry was attempting to change the course of the ship, with a sharper focus on shareholder value. Unfortunately, he was not very communicative about his plans.What impact will the announcement have on Tata group shares? It is now up to the board to take immediate steps to restore investor confidence. Unless the uncertainty is resolved soon, Tata group shares may pay a price for the abrupt and opaque decision to replace Mistry and the failure to communicate to investors that the board had cogent reasons for doing so.",2016-10-25,408Zf7yPvqLWnOmSQTyfDL,"Tata group shares may pay a price for abrupt, opaque decision to replace Cyrus Mistry with Ratan Tata as interim chairman",competitor,07:33,The elephant unseats Cyrus Mistry

				TCS named its chief financial officer Rajesh Gopinathan to succeed Chandrasekaran (popularly known as Chandra) as CEO.On Friday, TCS shares closed 3.9% lower at Rs2,252 apiece on the BSE. In comparison, the BSE IT index shed 1.9%, while the 30-share Sensex closed flat. The plunge shaved of Rs17,990 crore from the market capitalization of Indias most-valued firm.For Mumbai-headquartered TCS, the protracted period of subpar growth continued as Indias largest technology outsourcing firm reported a 0.3% dollar revenue growth, marginally higher than street expectations, in the October-December period....major management changes with current CEO being elevated to group chairman and replaced by current CFO overshadowed the results and could keep the stock under pressure until growth/margins improve, Jefferies India Pvt.

0.57,"Reacting to the railway budget, one industry stakeholder told a business news channel that he was happy with the announcements as long as he didnt think about how they would be funded. That aptly sums up the mood on the Street, which dumped railway-related stocks after the budget was presented.The highlight, of course, is the scaling up of capital expenditure (capex) to Rs.1.2 trillion for the next fiscal year, which is entirely commendable. But believing the big numbers requires a leap of faith.First, the targets set for the current fiscal year are seeing sharp cuts. Capex for the current year has been revised down from around Rs.1 trillion to Rs.82,192 crore. To be sure, thats far higher than what the railways has been clocking for years. But as of December, the national transporter spent only 64% of the revised capex target, an increase of less than one-fourth from the year-ago period.The second problem is resource generation. After meeting all expenditure, Indian Railways is estimated to generate net revenue of Rs.18,210 crore in the next fiscal year. It is not only 8% less than the current fiscal years revised estimate (which itself has been cut) but is also prone to serious downward revisions.Total traffic receipts (both from freight and passenger fares) are estimated to rise 10%, optimistic considering the lack of upward revision of tariffs. As in the previous budget, the ministry is projecting a double-digit (12%) growth in passenger earnings, when the number of passengers is actually declining. The expected fall is 1.5% in the current fiscal year. This year, passenger revenue is expected to go up by 7%. True, freight revenue growth projections are realistic at 5%. But lack of time-bound measures to revive the flagging volumesestimated to grow just 1% in the current fiscal yearhas been a disappointment.Of course, a significant part of the Plan expenditure is funded by support from the Union budget, borrowings and institutional finance. But as Religare Capital Markets Ltd points out, resources from all these sources have fallen short of budget estimates. If economic activity does not see a meaningful recovery and the governments fiscal position remains stretched, then it is likely the budgetary support for next fiscal year will also be constrained.The railways plans to further lower costs and boost non-traffic revenue. While the ministry has achieved some success in cost-control measures, non-traffic revenue is showing no signs of improvement yetin fact, it is expected to fall 8% this year.All this gives way to some doubts about the budget estimates. The poor performance in FY16 has few excuses, unless the projections for FY16 were too ambitious to begin with, Religare Capital Markets wrote in a note. One cannot help but be sceptical of FY17 projections, therefore, especially on the funding part of the planned expenditure.However, there is no denying that the railways capex is growing. As Dilip Bhat, joint managing director at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd, points out, even if the railways manages to achieve capex of Rs.1 trillion next fiscal year, it will be a significant improvement from the Rs.40,000-60,000 crore the organization was spending some years back.While that is a clear indication of the governments push to kick-start growth through increased public investments, the fact remains that the numbers need to be taken with a pinch of salt.",2016-02-26,4K3Wxb6Muf9pmFztI6WoqM,"The highlight of railways budget is the scaling up of capital expenditure to Rs1.2 trillion for the next fiscal year, which is commendable, but believing the big numbers requires a leap of faith

				Brookfield has been keen on acquiring renewable energy assets in India. They have recently started talks with Continuum to acquire the entire operational portfolio of the company, said one of the two people, requesting anonymity as the talks are private.Continuum has almost 400 megawatts (MW) of operational wind energy assets in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, he said. Investment bank Moelis and Co. is advising Continuum on the transaction, he added.According to the second of the two people, the transaction size could be in the range of Rs1,700-2,000 crore in terms of enterprise value. He also spoke on the condition of anonymity.Brookfield manages assets worth around $250 billion across various geographies and asset classes such as real estate, infrastructure, renewable energy and private equity.Continuum has been in talks for sometime to sell these assets. They had reached a deal with SunEdison, which later got scrapped because of SunEdisons financial troubles. Recently they were also in talks to raise primary capital with Partners Group, but those talks havent reached any conclusion and now they have engaged in discussions with Brookfield, the second person added.In June 2015, SunEdison had announced that it would acquire Continuums assets.

Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners is the majority owner in Continuum Wind, a Singapore-based, India-focused firm, in which it invested $212 million in 2012. Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners manages $4 billion globally.Continuum was set up in 2009 by Arvind Bansal and Vikash Saraf. Moelis and Partners Group declined to comment.

				Yahoo chief executive officer Marissa Mayer will assist with the transition until the sale is complete and then depart the company with a comfortable parachute worth more than $50 million in cash and stock. So lets not weep for her. But inevitably, a passel of eulogies will be crafted about her failed four-year attempt to turn around the company. These reflections will be largely unfair, because the decline and demise of Yahoo isnt totally her fault. Its at least partially the fault of its founders, Jerry Yang and David Filo.The early story of Yahoo is now Silicon Valley mythology. As graduate students at the Stanford School of Engineering in 1994, Yang, a math-oriented Taiwanese immigrant, and Filo, a quiet programmer from Louisiana, created a directory of links called Jerry and Davids Guide to the World Wide Web. It was a handy map to what was then an unnavigable digital landscape, and web surfers loved it. The following year, when Sequoia Capital invested in the newly renamed start-up, it brought in a former Motorola executive named Tim Koogle to be CEO.The move reflected the reigning conventional wisdom of the timebring in an experienced chief executive and go public early. But while they stepped aside to become chief Yahoos, as their business cards said, Filo and Yang stayed intimately involved. Filo, as the technical leader, wrote the very first version of Yahoo search and made the bulk of decisions about the companys underlying technical architecture. Yang stayed close to strategic decisions and was instrumental after the dot-com crash in replacing Koogle with Terry Semel, the longtime co-CEO of Warner Brothers.Semel brought with him a core group of native media execs whose names are now familiar in Silicon Valley, like Jeff Weiner, the CEO of LinkedIn, and Dan Rosensweig, CEO of textbook rental service Chegg. This was the origin of what would become Yahoos enduring split-personality: Was it a technology company or a media company? Sitting on perhaps the most valuable piece of real estate on the web, shuttling between its offices in Santa Monica, California, and Sunnyvale, Yahoo executives tried to be a little bit of both.Also Read: Verizon buys Yahoo, Marissa Mayer says planning to stayWe now know what it takes for technology companies to succeed: fierce, often unpleasant, founders who are able to make hard choices and place unpopular bets. During the years that Yahoo was banking on the media business, Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com, for example, expanded into unprofitable lines of online retail, brooked a painfully hollow stock price, cut workers, and finally spawned a completely different business in the cloud, called Amazon Web Services. At Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin brought in Eric Schmidt as CEO, but they governed as a triumvirate of equals, inventing an insanely profitable text advertising business that augmented web search results, rather than distracting from them like Yahoos eye-ball burning banner ads.During the 2000s, Yahoos biggest mistakes were failures of will. Semel, billed as a deals guy from Hollywood, could have bought Google in 2002, as Fred Vogelstein reported in Wired. Yahoo also came close to buying Facebook in 2006, until Semel lowered his offer from $1 billion to $850 million after a disappointing earnings report, alienating an already reluctant Mark Zuckerberg in the process, according to David Kirkpatricks book, The Facebook Effect.These acquisitions probably looked like risky, uneconomical moves that Yahoo investors might hate. Thats the whole point. Web companies need the unique power of founders to do unpopular things. Page advocated for Google to buy the money-losing video sharing site YouTube in 2006; Zuckerberg made what seemed like an outrageously overpriced bet on the photo app Instagram in 2012. This is how tech companies survivethe ability to take risks.Yang took over as CEO from Semel in 2007 but was either too nice or too unwilling to make hard decisions. In retrospect, he should have fired more employees, and banked hard toward technology and the emerging smartphone revolution. In what now looks like his biggest blunder, he turned away one of the best exits Yahoo would ever see, Microsofts unsolicited $45 billion bid in 2008, an effort by then CEO Steve Ballmer to compete with Google.Also Read: Yahoos Tumblr unveils live videoIn what should now be the canonical photo of Yahoos decline, from the Allen & Co. conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, that June, Yang was pictured sitting with Page and Brin, his head in his hands, presumably bemoaning the overture from the big, lame software blunderbuss from the north. The photo reveals Yangs confusion at the time about Yahoos true enemy. It was not Ballmer and his gang of Windows fanatics. It was the Google guys, there listening supportively across the table from him.After that, it was pretty much over for slow-footed Yahoo, trying to navigate a fast-changing internet landscape with uninspired CEOs like Carol Bartz and Scott Thompson at the helm. In periodically leaked missives, executives bemoaned that Yahoo was spreading itself too thin over too many lackluster products. Without a steadier hand from its founders, Yahoo had lost its way culturally as much as strategically. It was fat with layers of accountants, lawyers, and product managers, people whose job it was to mitigate risk, rather than take it. Yang didnt respond to requests for comment, and Filo declined to comment through a spokeswoman.The founders did make big contributions. In 2005, Yang helped orchestrate what would be the companys best deal: the sale of its businesses in China to Alibaba, along with a $1 billion investment. He deserves tons of credit for that. Its also likely that his voice was not always heard. In 2012, Yang left the companys board of directors after its disastrous decision to hire PayPals Scott Thompson as CEO and then promptly fire him upon discovering he fibbed on his résumé. For his part, Filo has been the picture of corporate loyalty in an age sorely lacking it. He joined the Yahoo board when Mayer took over the company and, by all accounts, remains an inspirational figure.But by that time, the mistakes of the past loomed too large. Perhaps there was a short window of opportunity for Mayer to bet the company on a bold acquisition or a new product, but it closed fast. She made strange moves, spending a huge chunk of her figurative and literal capital on a $1.1 billion deal for the also-ran social network Tumblr in 2013. Tumblr, like so many other Yahoo acquisitions (Flickr, et al.) went nowhere fast, perhaps because there were not enough nutrients in the Yahoo soil for any startup to thrive.Others have chronicled more of Mayers mistakes. But now its all ancient internet history, to be parceled out and puzzled over by business school students. Its time for us to mourn Yahoo. Sorry, I meanYahoo!

0.43,"On 27 and 28 February, five teams from India will present their models on how Hyperloop can be used to  connect Bengaluru to Thiruvananthapuram, Chennai to Bengaluru (two teams), Mumbai to Chennai, and Mumbai to Delhi.
				   
				Hyperloop, a low-pressure tube in which magnetically levitated pod-like vehicles can ferry passengers, sometimes at speeds in excess of 1,000 kmph, is the brainchild of Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX and Tesla Motors. But Musk, busy with his other ventures, is not developing a commercial Hyperloop. Two firmsHyperloop One and Hyperloop Transportation Technologies Inc. (HTT)are, and both are keen to introduce the Hyperloop in India. Hyperloop One is currently building a prototype in the Nevada desert in the US. Simultaneously, it is scouting for partners to whom it can license its technology to build Hyperloop routes in various countries. To that end, it launched a global competitionthe Hyperloop One Global Challengein which several consortia participated. Of these, 30 were shortlisted, including five from India, (prn.to/2jwi9UP), according to Nick Earle, senior vice-president of global field operations, Hyperloop One.By March this year, said Earle, who is on his first visit to India, we will demonstrate a pod travelling in passive magnetic levitation in a forward motion inside a pressure-reduced tube (not 100% vacuum). We are just weeks away from proving the technology with the worlds first demonstration.Unlike what his competitors are doing, insists Earle, the build-out at Nevada is a full-scale prototype with everything that you need to build a real-world Hyperloop. He said his companys philosophy is to build it, engineer it, prove that it works and then go to different countries to deploy it.Earle and his team are in India to meet government officials and potential partners and review the work of the five Indian teams. When we look at which country could benefit the most from Hyperloop, we look for large ridership population or freight demand, GDP growth, requirement for national productivity,  and the engineering and academic prowess to build this locally, said Earle who likens the Hyperloop concept to broadband for transportation.India, then, is a natural fit. Alan James, vice-president of worldwide business development for passenger systems at Hyperloop One added, India is the primary spot in Asia as far as Hyperloop is concerned.Hyperloop Ones rival HTT was founded on a crowd-funding model. In December, Bibop Gresta, chairman and co-founder of HTT, met Indias union minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari (bit.ly/2glawkG), and proposed linking  Mumbai and Pune with its ultra-high speed transport system. The cost (of building the track) depends on the location. To be generic, it will be $40 million per km. But it is one-fourth of high-speed rail. When you consider investment in infrastructure, you also consider how fast you can recoup it. This investment can be recouped in eight years, Gresta said. HTT has an exclusive agreement with the US-based Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for using its passive magnetic levitation system as the core of low-cost, safety-conscious construction and design in its Hyperloop, according to the companys website.Maglev, or magnetic levitation, is a technology that enables a train to float 1-6 inches above the track on a cushion of magnetic power and runs at a minimum speed of 350 kmph and a maximum of 500 kmph.Earle too says the Hyperloop will cost less than high-speed trains50% or less compared to the cost of high-speed rail or similar transport systems over a 30-year operational cycle, but we expect economic benefits to be three-and-a-half to four times greater.Apart from HTT and Hyperloop One, Spains Talgo SA, Germanys Siemens AG and Knorr Bremse AG, are wooing Indian policymakers with their transport technologies. Mint reported on 5 January (bit.ly/2joNU4s) that the ministry of road transport and highways has sought approval from the Niti Aayog to experiment and introduce new mass rapid transportation technologies such as Hyperloop and pod-taxis. Some pilots are already in the works. For instance, a pod-taxi pilot, with Metrino-PRT,  will soon let passengers use Indias first driverless pods on a 12.3km stretch from the Delhi-Haryana border to Badshapur via Rajiv Chowk in Delhi and Iffco Chowk and Sohna Road in Gurgaon. The project will cost Rs800 crore. Indeed, across the country governments and government departments are setting aside money for such projects. The Indian Railways, which seems sincere about high-speed trains this time and which has been running some trials with them,  is planning a capital expenditure of around Rs1.3 trillion for the fiscal year 2017-18the highest-ever capital outlay and is expecting a gross budgetary support of around Rs55,000 crore from the finance ministry.To be sure, its early days yet for Hyperloop. The technology solution is some time away, and the cost of developing it will run into  billions of dollars. Both Hyperloop One and HTT are rushing to raise funds from investors.On 1 December, HTT said it surpassed $100 million in total investment. This included an equity investment of $31.8 million and in kind and land value investments of $77 million. Earle of Hyperloop One, on the other hand, insisted that all the $160 million his company has been able to raise so far is in real, hard cash.Meanwhile, critics of Hyperloop claim that at such high speeds, there could be health hazards arising from travelling in Hyperloop (which can be built on the ground, in tunnels or higher up on pylons). Dismissing these concerns, Earle believes that the travel experience will be similar to what people have in air travelonly, there would not be any turbulence because things here are happening in a controlled environmentAccording to Earle, an airplane starts stationary, then it accelerates at about 0.3-0.4gwhich is what the Hyperloop pod accelerates atit then goes up in the sky, whereas the pod stays close to the ground. The reason the plane goes up in the sky is that it needs low air pressure to travel at 600 miles an hour; we take the low air pressure and bring it down to the ground. In its final leg, the plane decelerates and stops; thats exactly how the Hyperloop works: stationary, accelerating at 0.3g, travelling at 700 miles an hour, decelerating and then stopping. The human body doesnt sense speed; it senses acceleration, which is the same as in air travel.Does Hyperloop make sense for a country like India?G. Raghuram, professor, Public Systems Group, at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, says the concept of Hyperloop is a good one, as it can reduce energy consumption significantly and speed up transport.  However, he cautions that from a safety point of view, the technology is yet to be proven. Also, Im not sure how useful it will be for a country like India that needs to transport people on a large scale.  In my opinion, India should not jump headlong into it but take a wait-and-watch approach and see the implementation elsewhere first.Still, the prospect of travelling from Mumbai to Pune in around 30 minutes or Delhi to Mumbai in under two hours, without flying, is attractive.",2017-01-27,4SR0XqWS2qbkhtr5rrPC5I,"Hyperloop One and Hyperloop Transportation Technologies Inc. are, and both are keen to introduce the Hyperloop in India",company,00:56,Can Hyperloop transform how Indians travel?
-0.2,"Sydney: India is scouting for new liquefied natural gas contracts globally as part of a push to secure cheap supplies for its under-utilized gas-fired power plants.
				   
				Australia, Qatar and Iran could all act as potential suppliers of long-term LNG contracts, power minister Piyush Goyal said in Sydney on Thursday. The global search for LNG comes as Indias gas-fired plants, which can generate nearly 25 gigawatts of power, run at less than a quarter of their capacity because of a shortage of the fuel at affordable prices.I think gas needs to be between $5 and $5.50 landed at my power plant. That is what Im looking for in the medium- to long-term, Goyal said in an interview. Otherwise I wont be able to start those gas plants.NTPC Ltd., Indias biggest power producer, is said to be seeking to terminate a long-term supply contract for LNG because the fuel is too expensive to be used in power generation. That highlights the countrys difficulty in switching from coal to natural gas for power generation, undermining Prime Minister Narendra Modis efforts to cut carbon emissions and promote clean energy.As of now I dont have any credible offer on the table but Im fairly confident from talking to people across the world that if not Australia, maybe Qatar will give it to me, or Iran might be able to get me something, Goyal said. Ill go to Europe next week to discuss the same thing. I am sure Ill find a seller.Spot LNG in Singapore rose to $6.542 per million British thermal units this week, the highest since December, according to the Singapore Exchange Ltd. Prices are up more than 65% from a low in April.Australia investmentsIndia is also targeting investments in Australian LNG projects and coking coal mines to secure fresh sources of supply, Goyal said.We could buy stakes, we could buy the whole LNG plant itself, we could look at coal mines, Goyal said.Petronet LNG Ltd., Indias biggest LNG importer, signed a pact with Exxon Mobil Corp. in 2009 for supply of 1.5 million tons of the super-chilled fuel for 20 years from the Gorgon LNG project in Australia. Supplies are expected to begin next month.Goyal also expects Indian companies to boost their investments in Australia despite delays to Adani Enterprises Ltd.s Carmichael mine in Queensland, which was hampered by environmental protests. The Queensland government earlier this month invoked special powers to accelerate the project.

-1.0,"Inventory gains were the flavour of the season for refining firms. 
				   
				The Singapore complex gross refining margin (GRM), a measure of the difference between the per-barrel price of crude and the value of products distilled from it, dropped to $5 a barrel in the June quarter, compared with $7.7 a barrel in the March quarter. Still, the reported GRMs of Indian refining firms on a sequential basis fared better. However, these GRMs got a boost on account of inventory gains, thanks to the rising oil price trend over the quarter.Adjusted for refining inventory gains, the GRMs of oil marketing companies (OMCs) were in the range of $4-5 a barrel, according to Spark Capital Advisors (India) Pvt. Ltd. OMCs include Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC). OMCs results beat Street expectations. IOCs operating profit increased by one-third, compared with last years June quarter. HPCLs operating profit rose 17% year-on-year, while BPCLs operating profit increased at a much slower pace of 3%.GRM is a measure of profitability.Reliance Industries Ltds (RIL) reported premium of $6.5 per barrel over Singapore GRM was the highest in the past eight years, according to the firm, and exceeded Street estimates by a good margin. Most analysts expected RILs GRM to be $9.5-10 per barrel. But RILs GRM came in at $11.5 per barrel. The management indicated $2 per barrel can be attributed to gains from inventory, hedging and risk management. RILs stand-alone revenue fell 19%, reflecting the decline in the broader crude oil prices, while net profit rose about 19%. That was because of a 628 basis points jump in operating profit margin, a 3% decline in depreciation cost and an 18.5% rise in other income. A basis point is 0.01%.Meanwhile, oil producers have had it tough what with oil prices languishing. As expected, net price realization of Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd and Oil India Ltd declined 22% and 25% year-on-year, respectively.Oil marketing stocks have outperformed the Sensex so far this fiscal, while RIL stock has underperformed. However, RIL shares have performed well after the announcement of the imminent commercial launch of services by its telecom unit at its annual general meeting in early September. Singapore GRMs also strengthened in September, which helped sentiment.

0.25,"Early-stage investors, it would appear, have rediscovered their love for the healthcare sector. Since March, investors have concluded around 17 deals that have something or the other to do with healthcare. There may be more deals. This is based on a quick scan of the deals that have been reported by various media outlets. Still , its a substantial number that looks suspiciously like another gold rush is in the making.
				   
				Lets break down the deals to see where the money is headed. There are at least five app-based start-ups in the mix. This month, HealthifyMe, an app that enables users to track their fitness and connects them with nutritionists and trainers, picked up $6 million in a Series A round of funds from IDG Ventures India, Inventus Capital and Blume Ventures. In April, DocsApp, an app that lets patients consult with doctors, raised $1.2 million in a seed round led by Japanese venture capital firm Rebright Partners. In March, LoveCycles, a womens health and menstrual cycle tracker, raised a $700,000 round from Prime Venture Partners.It wouldnt be a surprise to see more early-stage investors make a beeline for such app-based start-ups over other categories in healthcare. The space received a big push last year when Practo, the Sequoia Capital backed start-up, raised a $90 million Series C round of funds led by Chinas Tencent Holdings. The valuation of the eight-year-old company, following the round, reportedly jumped to over $500 million.Then there are a few companies that would fall in the so-called online pharmacy category. The most well known of the lot is 1mg, which raised a $15 million Series B round led by Maverick Capital Ventures, the venture capital arm of Dallas-based hedge fund Maverick Capital, last month. Another online pharmacy that got funded last month is CareOnGo. It raised an undisclosed sum in a seed round from FAO Ventures.There are also a couple of outliers. Accel Partners recently led a Series B funding round in medical devices firm Consure Medical. It is working on faecal incontinence management technology, which is aimed at helping critical care patients among others. Earlier in March, the Indian Angel Network invested an undisclosed sum in stem cells research firm Transcell Biologics.Brick-and-mortar healthcare services firms are still not back in favour with investors, relative to the interest in the healthcare technology segments. But there has been a smattering of deals in that area, too. A couple of days ago, AddressHealth, a pediatric services healthcare chain, raised $1.5 million from Gray Matters Capital and existing investor Unitus Seed Fund. Earlier this month, dental services chain Vatsalya Centre for Oral Health raised $1.6 million from S-Squared Capital Investments.The home healthcare services segment, within the brick-and-mortar category, may become more interesting to investors soon.In January, SAIF Partners led a $4 million funding round in Care24. India Quotient, which had seed-funded the company earlier, participated in the round. There have been some big funding rounds in this business in the recent past. Last year, Portea Medical closed a $37.5 million funding round led by its existing investor Accel Partners. World Bank arm International Finance Corporation jumped in to participate, contributing $7 million to the round.The other notable deal in the segment last year was a big $10 million Series A round raised by Medwell Ventures from Fidelity Growth Partners India and Fidelity Biosciences.It isnt entirely surprising to see the heightened interest in the healthcare sector. Mint reported in March, quoting a Deloitte research report, that Indias overall healthcare market is worth $100 billion and is expected to grow at a 23% compounded annual growth rate to touch $280 billion by 2020. The report further estimates that the market for pharma e-commerce alone will grow 10 times to $400 million by 2017.The healthcare sector has also had a good run at the bourses lately, reigniting interest among investors. Last year, diagnostics services chain Dr Lal PathLabss public offering, which was subscribed more than 33 times, created profitable exits for its two private equity investorsWestBridge Capital Partners and TA Associates. Other successful public market outings include Narayana Hrudayalaya, which runs a chain of multispeciality hospitals, in December, and diagnostics labs chain Thyrocare Technologies Ltd last month. Thyrocares investors include CX Partners, Norwest Venture Partners and Samara Capital.Healthcare should be on the radar of investors, both early and later stage. Its one of those sectors that holds the key to solving massive problems in this country and offers multiple opportunities for non-linear growth. Investors just have to be careful that healthcare doesnt go the food technology way. The after-effects would be disastrous.",2016-05-27,4Yswe3cNQbyVZh3oU0dwuK,"Since March, investors have concluded around 17 deals that have something or the other to do with healthcare

-0.03,"Mumbai/New Delhi: Infrastructure conglomerate GMR Group has initiated discussions with SembCorp Industries Ltd of Singapore and US-based Lone Star Funds for selling a significant stake in GMR Chhattisgarh Energy Ltd (GCEL), a 100% subsidiary of GMR Energy Ltd (GEL), three people familiar with the matter said. The move is part of the groups efforts to bring down its  debt that stood at Rs43,400 crore at the end of September.
				   
				GCEL has two power plants with combined capacity of 1370 MW at Raipur, Chhattisgarh,  that commenced commercial operations in March.While SembCorp has been in talks with GMR for a while now, the discussion with Lone Star Funds is a new development and is exploratory in nature, said one of the three peoplea senior GMR Group executive who did not want to identified.The second person, a banker, said SembCorp is keen to pick up stake in the project. He added that the absence of long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) is a hurdle. These make the transaction viable given significant cost over-runs in the project.Currently, GCEL has only short-term PPAs. It is hoping to sign long-term PPAs with state-owned utilities in Uttar Pradesh and Telangana. It has already bid for such agreements in the case of the former.According to its most recent filings, GCEL has an overall debt of Rs8,290 crore and needs to start paying back money from March 2017. The three people said its enterprise value (EV) is close to Rs12,500 crore and includes two captive coal mines valued at Rs750 crore.During the normal course of business, We talk to various parties for different transactions. we would not like to comment on any specific transaction, said a GMR Infra spokesperson. Analysts say that GCEL will have to sign PPAs in the range of Rs3.80 per unit to make the project  viable. A slightly lower tariff could be sustainable but only if banks agree on a moratorium and a possible restructuring.We are talking to banks; everyone understands that the current situation helps no one, said the GMR executive. India is one of SembCorps key markets and an integral part of the companys emerging markets strategy. Were constantly on the lookout for suitable opportunities to grow our business in India especially in the areas of thermal power, renewable power, water treatment and urban development. However, we do not comment on  specific opportunities, a SembCorp spokesperson said. A spokesperson for Lone Star Funds declined comment. The GMR Group, which has interests in airports, energy, transportation and urban infrastructure, is monetizing assets to repay creditors after years of debt-driven expansion.In May, it sold a 30% stake in some of GMR Energy Ltds assets for $300 million (around Rs2,000 crore) to Malaysias largest electricity utility Tenaga Nasional Bhd.  In July, it sold 74% stake in Maru Transmission Services Ltd and 49% in Aravali Transmission Services Ltd to Adani Transmission Ltd for Rs 100 crore.Both SembCorp and Lone Star Funds were among the shortlisted bidders for SunEdisons India assets which were acquired by Hyderabad-based Greenko Energy for $392 million.The Singapore-based SembCorp Green Infra, a subsidiary of SembCorp Industries, has over 900 MW of wind and solar power assets in operation and under-development in southern, western and central India.Last year, it acquired a controlling stake in Green Infra from IDFC Alternatives for Rs1,060 crore, marking its entry into Indias renewable energy market. According to credit rating agency Crisil, Indias power generation capacity has grown at a compound average growth rate (CAGR) of 10% since 2009. Of this, the private sector contributed the mostclose to 60% of the coal-based capacityand invested Rs3.2 trillion.Despite the growth in capacity, the demand for power from distribution utilities (power discoms) has grown barely at 0.4% during this period. At least 15% of capacities added by private firms are without long term PPAs, affecting their ability to service debt.feedback@livemint.com",2016-10-19,4agAsLInQDwltDLr3kkeqI," GMR Group is in discussions with SembCorp Industries, Lone Star Fund for the stake sale in the Chhattisgarh power plant in a move to pare its debt",company,01:09,GMR Group in talks for stake sale in Chhattisgarh power plant
-0.24,"Amid all manner of disclosures, some quite unsavoury, in the Cyrus Mistry vs. Ratan Tata battle, the one silver lining has been how neither camp has accused the other of personal excesses. So while Mistry has suggested the groups pursuit of a small car for the Indian middle class was no more than a personal fancy of Tata and should be wound up, the accusation never extended to how the man who ran the group for over 20 years went and splurged on a gold plated Rolls Royce for himself. 
				   
				Indeed, till the time Tata Motors Ltd bought Jaguar Land Rover, the group owner would often squeeze himself into one of the more plebian cars the company made.In truth, most of Indias company owners and founders have conservative lifestyles with few of the wild and exotic indulgences that we associate with the billionaire lifestyle across the world. Sample this: in January 2014, the Dallas Safari Club, a hunters rights organization, auctioned off a permit which would allow the holder to travel to Namibia for the chance to kill one of only 5,000 surviving black rhinos. The auction was won by oil heir and Texas hunter Corey Knowlton, who bid $350,000 for that dubious right.It isnt the kind of thing that Tata or Kumar Mangalam Birla or Mukesh Ambani, or a dozen other Indian tycoons are likely to be doing on their summer breaks. Despite their obvious wealth, their sensibilities seem no different from that of many well-brought-up middle-class Indians of an earlier era. That shows even in the way most behave with people around them. Thus, Tata will often hold the elevator door open at Bombay House when he sees an executive rushing towards it and by all accounts Mistry is a chip off the same block.Dilip Shanghvi, founder of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and the countrys richest billionaire by some rankings, is low-key to a fault. Fortis Healthcare Ltd co-founders Malvinder and Shivinder Singh may be in the best-dressed lists of social magazines, but you are unlikely to find Prathap Reddy, founder of Apollo Hospitals or Y.K. Hamied, chairman of Cipla Ltd, displaying any sartorial vanities.Most of them dress simply, wearing suits only for meetings and even those tend to be the kind that will hardly attract attention. Tata, in fact, seems to have dropped his jacket of late, appearing in his shirt sleeves at most of the acrimonious annual general meetings of his group companies over the last few months. Clearly they are not following the example of UK-based billionaire Scott Alexander, dubbed the Vainest Man in Britain, who likes to buy out entire clothes collections, rather than just certain pieces. One year he spent £300,000 on clothes from Dolce & Gabbana.At meetings to discuss strategic plans for his group, Ajay Piramal munches on such frugal fare as khakra while Reliance Industries Ltd chairman Mukesh Ambanis fondness for vada paav is legendary. Contrast their gastronomical conservatism with that of Sean Parker, co-founder of Napster, who is known to have spent $13,000 on a single meal.Indias IT billionaires are of course in a class of their own in terms of frugality. Azim Premji, once Indias richest man, whose stake in Wipro Ltd. is worth nearly $15 billion, would often take an auto rickshaw from the old airport in Bengaluru and once threw a mini fit when he was automatically upgraded from his regular economy class seat on a Kingfisher flight to Delhi.The others, Infosys founders N.R. Narayana Murthy, Nandan Nilekani and the reclusive Shiv Nadar who set up HCL Technologies Ltd, are no different. The latters one indulgence is his Zen garden, on which he showers attentions. How utterly boring, when compared to Australian billionaire Clive Palmer, who got himself a $600 million replica of the Titanic, or another billionaire who recently ordered a diamond and gold encrusted collar for his pet dog.Of course, Indias billionaire class has its honourable exceptions and the latest gizmo or car eventually does find its way to Indian shores. But these are few, and their excesses still raise an eyebrow.",2017-01-03,4fi8FzAKiTzjZRLgF6H9LM,Most of Indias company owners and founders have conservative lifestylescontrary to exotic indulgences that are associated with the billionaire lifestyle across the world,competitor,14:47,Indias middle-class billionaires
0.25,"Ahead of his World Chess Championship (11-30 November) match against challenger Sergey Karjakin in November, defending champion Magnus Carlsen contacted Microsoft Corp. Its not that he wanted Office installed on his laptop, but he was simply seeking help to prevent hacking.
				   
				Carlsen, who relies heavily on specialised chess computers for his preparation, was worried that Russian hackers would gain access to his tactics which, in turn, could help Crimean-born Karjakin, reported The Indian Express. His fears stemmed from precedence: Russia-based hackers had broken into the World Anti-Doping Agencys website sometime back.Technology is now integral to sportand not just in malpractices like the one cited above (Carlsen retained his title). Technology is used in training, diet, recovery, clothes, shoes and in every sphere of the modern sporting world. In speed skating, an academic paper World Records: How much athlete? How much technology? suggests that half of the progress of world records has been due to changes in technologyand the other half from real athletic improvement.Three key areas have been consistently in prominence: first, the use of technology in officiating or umpiring; second, in data analysis; and third, in safety. All three play a role in driving sporting excellence and, more importantly, particularly in the world of sport, driving fans experience. It can be argued that too much reliance on science or numbers removes the element of instinct from sportone which allows M.S. Dhoni to promote himself in a World Cup cricket final or tells Stan Wawrinka to hit that backhand in the 2015 French Open tennis final. But when millimetres and fractions of seconds decide the difference between winner and runner-up, any help becomes welcome in the high intensity, competitive world of modern sport. Heres a look at how technology makes a mark in these three facets of sport.Not just line callsIn the first Test match against England in November, India were 208-1 with Cheteshwar Pujara batting on 86 when a ball bowled by Zafar Ansari hit the batsman on his leg. The umpire gave him out but Pujara, playing at home in Rajkot, asked for a review.The reconsideration decided the ball was going over the stumps and the umpires decision was revised. As the crowd roared, Pujaras wife did a little jig in the stands and two men sitting across Pujaras father shook hands, the commentator paid due credit: Thank you ICC and DRS.The Board of Control for Cricket in India has for long opposed the decision review system (DRS), citing inaccuracies in its methodology, but agreed to it on a trial basis for the five-Test series. But if a replay benefited Pujara (he went on to score a century in the first innings) it has benefited several others, too.Video replays have been used in many sports besides crickettennis, rugby, baseball and basketball, to name a fewfor different purposes. In basketball, it can be used to find out if the shot was released before the final buzzer, in baseball to handle boundary calls and in tennis/badminton whether the ball/shuttle landed inside or outside the lines. British firm Hawk-Eye, which has developed systems for many sports, uses 6-7 cameras to record the balls trajectory in tennis and puts together a three-dimensional image for officials to decide if the ball is in.Footballs governing body FIFA tried GoalControl technology during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The German-produced tech used 14 high-speed cameras and sensors mounted around the stadiumseven pointed at each goalto detect whether the ball has crossed the goal line or not. They could also combine their data into a three-dimensional format and send visual or vibration signals to the referees watch. A British firm Small Fry developed shin guards equipped with accelerometers and magnetic sensors that could reduce the number of dives in a football match. This could rob the sleep of players such as Chelseas Diego Costa.The Guardian reported other similar tools sometime back: Cairos Technologies and Adidas producing a system that uses a magnetic field to track the ball using a sensor embedded inside the ball, which detects the magnetic field produced by thin wires underneath the penalty box. Goalminder technology uses high-speed cameras built into the goal posts and crossbar to deliver visual evidence; GoalRef uses a magnetic field-based technology, too, but here the goal frame detects the passing of the ball.The International Football Association Board (IFAB) also approved testing of video technology to aid match officials (a final decision is to be taken later). The trials will allow referees to call on video assistance to help determine four categories of game-changing moments: goals scored, red cards, penalties and mistaken identity, AFP reported in March.In international sport, the stakes are very high. For instance, in the Olympics that are held once in four years, an athlete may not get a second shot at it since sporting careers tend to be brief, making margins of errors career-defining.So when Bahamas Shaunae Miller divedor fell as some have arguedat the end of the womens 400-metre race at the Rio Olympic Games in August, she lay on the track breathless for some time, as the result of the race remained unclear. It emerged later that she had beaten the favourite, Allyson Felix of the USA, to win the gold medal. The margin of victory: 0.07 seconds. The decision made by: Technology.Numbers tell how good you areOne of the best examples of using data comes from baseball, in which Oakland Athletics manager Billy Beane partnered a Yale graduate in crunching numbers and building a low-budget team of winnersimmortalized in the book Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game and a Hollywood movie. That was over a decade ago.Since then, innovations like Major League Baseballs Statcast and the National Basketball Associations SportVU systemsa system of six cameras in each arena that measures the movements of the ball and every player on the court, generating an entire database of performance informationhave leveraged data to assist coaches and players. Teams in the National Basketball Association, such as the San Antonio Spurs, have similarly used Big Data sets to help owners and coaches recruit players and execute game plans, according to the Stanford Graduate School of Business.A hand-held device called Skulpt helps improve trainingits 12 sensors, when pressed against the skin, create electric current that measures the percentage of muscle fibre versus fat stored inside the muscle. EliteForm is a technology that tracks and analyses an athletes movements while training and during games, the CNN listed in February.Niall Clark, who is the head of performance at Sachin Tendulkar co-owned Kerala Blasters, the football team in the Indian Super League, says they rely heavily on heart rate monitors and GPS. The players are given intense amount of work on certain days so they can hit specific heart rate zones and 60-70% of their individual heart rate for a maximum of 20 minutesfor recovery of homeostasis balance. GPS helps find out how much distance a player has covered, sprints he has made, accelerations and decelerationdata that help find out how the hamstring is working.GPS has also helped find that midfielders, for example, travel farther but accelerated less than players in other positions. If there is a big jump from one to other morning in the resting heart rate, we know something is wrong. Saliva helps with hormone levels, blood levels, to gauge player fitness. We havent had any muscle injuries in the season; contact injuriesyou cannot do anything about, says Clark.In certain other places, filming an athlete to gauge form and errors is passé now. Newer three-dimensional motion capture technologylike the Xbox Kinect systemsand biometric feedback on heart and respiratory rates, can give far more information, SportTechie reported.Another device, Motionize, that sends real-time information directly to an app, is a virtual coach for canoeists and kayakers. It uses two sensors, one on the boat and one on the paddle, and displays a complete view of the athletes movements on the cellphone screen.Cricket, a sport heavily influenced by statistics and datafor both performers and fansis not far behind either. Firms like CricHQwhich has the expertise of former New Zealand cricketers Stephen Fleming and Brendon McCullumCricket 21 and SportsMechanics, a sports analytics firm, crunch numbers for teams.CricHQ, which is working in conjunction with Callaghan Innovation to build the worlds best match projection engine, claims to be able to predict with a confidence interval of approximately 75% the result of any fixture in the IPL (using previous IPL data). Confidence interval is a range in which a measurement or trial falls corresponding to a given probability. We are looking to expose this engine for the 2017 IPL and hope to provide a unique experience for customers and consumers alike, says David Robertson, the companys chief data officer.Wear it, bear it for safetyIn November 2014, Australian cricketer Phil Hughes was struck by a ball on the back of his neck while batting during a first-class game. He collapsed on the pitch and died two days later. But strange as that incident may seem, it was not isolated.In recent times, at least three other people have succumbed to injuries on the cricket field: in November the same year, an Israeli umpire died after being struck on the jaw by a ball; in April 2015 a 20-year-old club cricketer died after colliding with another player in Kolkata and in July, another in England died after being struck on the chest while batting. International cricketers like Joe Root, Craig Kieswetter and Stuart Broad have suffered impact injuries in recent times, highlighting the need for on-field safety. During the same Rajkot Test, Pujara was struck thrice on his helmet.The ill-effect of force is not uniqueauthor Jeanne Marie Laskas wrote about a pathologist, Dr Bennet Omalu, who discovered that American footballers could suffer from mental deterioration caused by blows to the head. It was made into a movie last year, Concussion.NFL moved on to smart helmets, which have sensor and magnet technologysensors detect and disperse the force of collisions, while the magnet will help by spreading and absorbing the force.Since the Hughes incident and even before that, cricket has taken corrective measures, as the International Cricket Council brought in new regulations. Helmets now have a stem guard, made of thermoplastic polyurethane, to shield the back of the head and neck. It is a clip-on attachment to the side of the grille, with enhanced impact absorption, reported espncricinfo.com early this year.Over the years, other sports have modified their methods for the sake of safer practices. For example, the centre of gravity of javelins was changed to ensure they remained within existing boundaries. Amateur boxers have had to wear headgears for protection.Physiotherapist John Gloster explains how biomechanical analysis is important to correct bowling action, thereby preventing injuries. With super slow-motion, one can analyse the forces acting on the spine. Biomechanical analysis, motion analysis systems, data analysis, running analysis all of them allow to make athletes more efficient, says Gloster, who has worked with the Indian cricket team in the past and is currently the sports technical advisor for KOOH, a sports education and technology company. He also stresses the importance of sleep as a predictor and preventer of injuries. He can monitor the profile of the athlete, over the week, to predict injury. Gloster uses a hand-held dynamometer to measure muscle force and ensure the athlete has the right amount in balance with other muscles. Gloster and KOOH also work with children on fitness. This includes, as he mentions with irony, trying to encourage the child away from gadgets and technology and onto the sporting field.",2017-01-23,4fmH5PGwNRbt4J9iMrAHbO,"Technology is now integral to sport: is used in training, diet, recovery, clothes, shoes and in every sphere of the modern sporting world.",company,05:24,How hi-tech raises the sports bar
-0.42,"San Francisco:  Elon Musk showcased his ambitions to make Tesla Motors Inc. a clean-energy behemoth on Friday, unveiling a new solar-roof product at an evening event at Universal Studios in Los Angeles, California.
				   
				As the sun set, Musk told hundreds of guests gathered outside that Tesla and SolarCity Corp., the company that he chairs and which he aims to acquire, will make solar roofs that look better than normal roofs. He then showcased several houses with different roofing styles and said they were all solar, with solar panels embedded into glass shingles.How do we have a solar roof that is better than a normal roof, looks better, last longer, said Musk. You want to pull your neighbours over and say Check out this sweet roof.Musks presentation was short on details about the efficiency of the solar roofs, their warranty, cost or when they will be available. The solar roof is offered in four styles: Textured Glass Tile, Slate Glass Tile, Tuscan Glass Tile, and Smooth Glass Tile  due to a variety of architectural styles.Home batteriesThe idea is that homeowners will generate electricity for their home with solar power, then store that electricity in a home battery known as a Powerwall. You can fill up your battery during the day, then discharge it at night when the sun sets.Musk and Tesla chief technology officer JB Straubel have long envisioned a clean-energy future of electric cars powered by an increasingly solar grid, with Teslas batteries optimizing both. The company also offers much larger Powerpack systems to commercial and utility customers and has deployed almost 300 megawatt hours in 18 countries to date, according to a blog post on Thursday.Battery-based energy storage has the potential to revolutionize electricity for the worlds poorest citizens the way mobile technology disrupted the telecommunications industry. Coupled with solar panels or wind turbines, powerful lithium-ion batteries can store energy and provide electricity for the roughly 1.3 billion people worldwide who dont have access to electricity and face whats called energy poverty.Fridays event is part of concerted effort to make the case for the SolarCity acquisition to investors. More details, including financial information, will be revealed 1 November, when the company has said it plans to create a clear picture of how a combined Tesla and SolarCity will make solar and storage as compelling as electric vehicles. The proposed merger has been controversial because Musk is the chairman and largest financier of SolarCity, and the boards of both companies are deeply intertwined. Shareholders are to vote on the proposed merger 17 November.

0.54,"Beijing: China is seeking to build up export markets for its power amid signs the nation has invested too much in new generation plants.
				   
				State Grid Corp. of China, which runs the majority of the nations electricity distribution network, is considering how to build links to India, South Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia, a move that would require billions of dollars of investment in long-distance, high-voltage power lines.Interconnections would allow grid managers throughout the region to more flexibility use variable supplies coming from wind and solar farms cropping up from Vietnam to Mongolia. For China, the links would provide customers for power from hundreds of power plants finished in the past few years as demand in its domestic market stagnates.We can export to India and Southeast Asia where the power supply is inadequate, Zhang Qiping, chief engineer of State Grid, said on Tuesday at a conference hosted by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) in Shanghai.China, which is the worlds biggest investor in fossil-fuel generation, started more than 70 gigawatts of new coal projects last year and had 200 gigawatts under construction at the end of April, the Paris-based International Energy Agency said in September. At the same time, most plants are sitting idle more than half the time, and low-carbon sources of electricity including nuclear and renewables are covering additional demand.That report added weight to concerns voiced by environmental groups such as Greenpeace that China is apt to waste 1 trillion yuan ($148 billion) on excess power capacity by 2020.At the BNEF conference in Shanghai, energy policymakers from China, Thailand and Mongolia spoke about the merits of building a regional network of power interconnections, which would help reduce the cost of electricity and make grids more flexible in dealing with renewables. The issue is biggest for China, which has the largest power network in the region.Asia will be an important part in the global energy interconnection, Wang Min, vice general manager at State Grid, said at the BNEF meeting. The region, he said, has the biggest potential in energy economic growth and is a region with the most and fast-growing energy demand.Shift indicatedThe remarks at the BNEF conference are the fullest indication yet that the bid for interconnections has backing from the Chinese government. Wang said the effort fits with president Xi Jinpings effort launched in September 2015 to reduce pollution in Chinas power utility industry, part of the nations commitment with the US to hold back greenhouse gases damaging the climate.Regional interconnections will help each nation achieve targets to cap carbon emissions under the United Nations climate deal agreed in Paris last year, said Yao Qiang, vice general manager of Power Construction Corp. of China Ltd. The effort to replace fossil fuels with renewables is an unstoppable trend, he said.Also Read: China steel behemoth gets finishing touchesSignals pointing toward the priority that China places on inter-connectors emerged in March. Then, State Grid joined Tokyo-based wireless carrier SoftBank Group Corp., Korea Electric Power Corp. and Russian grid company Rosseti Pjsc in agreeing to research and plan for interconnected power grids in Northeast Asia as part of a plan dubbed Asia Super Grid.State Grids Wang has also proposed an ultra-high-voltage global power network to transmit electricity from country to country and continent to continent, with costs estimated at $50 trillion to develop by 2050.Other stepsTheres indications that more nations in the region are sympathetic to Chinas effort program.There are lots of engineering challenges, Michael Liebreich, founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said on a panel discussion about the issue at the event in Shanghai. The longer distance youre moving the power, the more exposed to interruption and catastrophic implications. These are issues that need to be addressed,For China, interconnections would combine smart grids, ultra-high voltage and clean energy, said Wang Yimin, who is currently the secretary general of the Global Energy Interconnection Development & Cooperation Organization. Created in March, Wangs organization is designed to promote links throughout the region.Its doable in technology, said Wang, adding current ultra-high voltage lines can transmit as much as 15 gigawatts of power through 5,000 kilometers.The organization is planning to draft a plan by the end of this year for transmitting power from East China to South Korea and then to Japan, Wang said.

0.55,"Singapore: This weeks putsch at Tata Sons has already served one useful purpose. While its been clear for a while that something wasnt quite right at the $100 billion Indian empire, the chairmans surprise ouster has made it possible to start asking questions about strategy (or lack of it) at a conglomerate that traces its roots to the American civil war.
				   
				Did the newly dumped Cyrus Mistry fail to plant enough saplings of growth? Or did Ratan Tata, who gave Mistry the job only to take it back four years later, not want to face reality? Are some of the businesses he acquired now covered in weeds, compelling Mistry to trim the outgrowth of debt?The answers will be important for investors in the groups publicly traded units, who, at present, have no idea how the coup at the holding company will affect them.Letting Tata vs. Mistry play out in public is a delicious idea. With the Economic Times leaking the contents of an unhappy email purportedly written by Mistry to the Tata Sons board and owners, and at least one of those shareholders giving a TV interview on what they disliked about the Mistry regime, the slugfest has begun. Its time to pour a cup of (Tata-owned) Tetley tea, and settle down.Also Read: Tata Sons dividend payout steady for last decadeV.R. Mehta, a trustee at one of the philanthropic organizations that collectively own roughly two-thirds of Tata Sons, is right to argue that under Mistry, the dividends from group companies have become increasingly reliant on just two businesses  Jaguar Land Rover, one of Ratan Tatas most audacious acquisitions, and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., the software export unit.But to what extent is Mistry responsible? In the letter attributed to him by the Economic Times, the ousted chairman claimed that it was Ratan Tatas 2009 decision to buy a property in suburban Mumbai  in disuse since a 1993 bomb attack  that led to Indian Hotels Co.s entire net worth getting wiped out. The companys last big profit, of $115 million, was in 2008.Then again, a year after Ratan Tata bought Corus Group Plc in 2006, Tata Steel went on to earn an annual profit of almost $3 billion. A China-led global steel glut has turned that profit into a loss of $1 billion over the past four quarters, with Mistry warning in his letter of a potential $10 billion impairment of European steel assets.Tata Steels loss in past 4 quartersMistry cant shift all the blame to his predecessor. While Ratan Tatas non-JLR car investments have mostly flopped, Mistrys problem was not having enough big ideas of his own. He may not have been the one to sink the wireless telecom unit, but he did precious little to revive it. He could also have handled the ugly spat with NTT Docomo Inc., the partner in that business, a lot better.Also Read: Ratan Tata seeks to rally group firms after Cyrus Mistry ousterThe Tata Group has survived two world wars, nationalization of its prized airline by a socialist-minded government and other tribulations. But the damage to the groups reputation for fair dealing is probably Mistrys biggest failing as chairman.That failure has consequences. In Singapore, bond investors are scratching their heads over a dollar-denominated perpetual bond issue by Tata International Ltd. The debt of this thinly capitalized company will derive its value from implicit support by the Tata group. A few years ago, it would have been preposterous to suggest that the Tatas would stake their reputation to save $1.17 billion  the amount the group is seeking to avoid paying in the Docomo dispute. Its worrisome if investors are no longer sure whether the group will even back a $150 million to $200 million bond issue. A no-holds-barred airing of differences between Mistry and Ratan Tata may help reestablish just what it is that shareholders of Tata Sons want their group to stand for. That will be the cherry on the cake from this entertaining spectacle  to be washed down with that Tetley tea, of course.

-0.66,"New Delhi: The fine print of Union budget 2017-18 has served incentives for the energy sector such as lowering the tax burden on carbon trading gains and making it more attractive for foreign oil firms to store crude oil in Indias strategic reserves. 
				   
				The incentives seek to support energy security and climate change goals of the country after having decisively departed from petroleum subsidies.Union finance minister Arun Jaitley has proposed to cut the tax on gains from carbon trading to 10% from 30% in a move expected to make investments into energy efficiency and clean energy more rewarding. The minister also extended the income tax exemption to foreign companies storing crude oil in Indias strategic reserves to any gains from sale of such oil even after expiry of the companys contract with the Indian government. At the moment, this benefit is limited only during the contract period.The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) set up under the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) allows investors in emission-reducing projects to generate tradable credits corresponding to the volume of emission reduction achieved. These credits can be sold to industrialized countries. So far, the income tax department has been treating the income on transfer of carbon credits as business income, subject to a 30% tax. Jaitley has proposed that it shall be a concessional 10% and applicable surcharge and cess. This amendment will take effect from the 2017-18 financial year.The move to incentivize clean energy projects comes parallelly with gradual increase in taxes on petroleum products and the cess on coal, making India one of the leaders in climate change action. Since June 2014, when international oil prices started declining, India has increased excise duty on branded petrol from Rs15.5 a litre to Rs22.7 a litre as of December 2016 and on branded diesel from Rs5.8 a litre to Rs19.7 a litre, pointed out the Economic Survey 2016-17.In contrast, the governments of most advanced countries have simply passed on the benefits to consumers, setting back the cause of curbing climate change. As a result, India now outperforms all the countries except those in Europe in terms of tax on petroleum and diesel, the survey pointed out.Ashish Khanna, chief executive officer of Tata Power Solar Systems Ltd, said the budget demonstrated the governments commitment to being a front runner in renewable sources of energy.In line with the governments stated objective of phasing out corporate tax exemptions in order to be able to moderate the corporate tax rate from 30% to 25%, Jaitley did not extend the income tax incentive for power projects under section 80 IA after it expires on 31 March 2017. Those who complete power projects before this deadline will, however, be able to claim full deduction of income from the project while calculating the companys taxable income for 10 years.",2017-02-02,54hs1Tu1BnOPwTRwjFxHIK,The incentives seek to support energy security and climate change goals of the country,both,12:48,Budget 2017: Income tax break for carbon trading and strategic oil reserves

In the last three years, the S&P BSE PSU index, which tracks shares of public sector units (PSUs), gained 18.6%, half of what the benchmark Sensex delivered (38.9%). But one business bucking this trend is the power sector.
				   
				Shares of notable central PSUsPower Grid Corp. of India Ltd, NTPC Ltd, Neyveli Lignite Corp. Ltd, SJVN Ltd and NHPC Ltddelivered double digit returns in the last three years, whereas shareholders of private sector firms Tata Power Co. Ltd and Adani Power Ltd have lost out. The divergence can be partly explained by the return on equity (RoE). The higher the ratio, the better it is for investors. The average RoE of the five PSUs stood at 11% in the past fiscal. A similar calculation of nine private sector firms stood at 4%, data from Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd show.While returns of PSUs have been consistent, private firms returns have been volatile. Three of the five PSUs generated double-digit RoEs in each of the last five years, a feat matched by none of the private firms, except JSW Energy Ltd which delivered double-digit returns in four of the last five years.The reasons are not hard to find. PSU utilities work mostly on the cost-plus modelinvestments, assets are assured of minimum returns. Private firms, on the other hand, took excessive risks, running into business and regulatory hurdles. But this scenario will change. Private firms are seeking better tariffs for underperforming plants and are trying to improve asset utilization. Also, a slowdown in hydro capacity additions and delays in execution means ROEs at SJVN and NHPC can soften or suffer for some time. Within the PSU lot, the underperformance of SJVN, and NHPC to some extent, may be offset by Power Grid and NTPC. Religare Capital Markets Ltd expects Power Grids RoE to improve by about 100 basis points on high capex and capitalization schedule. Similarly, the upcoming capacities are expected to push up NTPCs returns from next year.

Consider the ordinary wooden cupboard which opens up to Narnia in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; or platform 9¾ of Londons Kings Cross station, the secret entrance to board a train to Hogwarts in the Harry Potter series; or the town of Macondo in One Hundred Years of Solitude, where the surreal is the normal.
				   
				The success of Pokémon Go is also in the realm of magical realismas augmented reality brings magical pocket monsters to our real world.It is no secret that the Pokémon Go craze has swept across the world. It has players in the US, Australia, New Zealand and major parts of Europe hooked. Terms such as PokéStops, Pokémon gyms and Pokéballs have already become common parlance.The first home video game consolea device that outputs a video signal or visual image to display a video gamewas manufactured as early as 1972, much before the days of Nintendos Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda. This bulky ensemble of a black, white and brown box called the Odyssey, manufactured by Magnavox, pales in comparison to the sophisticated modern-day versions of Sonys PlayStation and Microsofts Xbox. Nevertheless, it marked the beginning of a new mode of entertainment.Today, according to statistics published by the Entertainment Software Association, a majority of frequent gamers find that consoles hold more value for money than DVDs, movies and music. Four out of five US households own a device used to play video games with the average age of a player being 35 years.Thus, it is not surprising that Pokémon Go did well in a region which has been addicted to gaming for decades. Augmented reality via a smartphone as opposed to the virtual world created within the confines of homes by consoles offers something of a fresh perspective to the ordinarily sedentary gamer. It lets an individual walk about his locality, represented by an avatar guided by his phones GPS, and catch, train and battle with virtual creatures superimposed on the real world. Even if one accounts for the incidents of falling off cliffs and mugging, or the claims that video games decrease the grey area of the brain, the game has a charm to it and an unreal one at that.The video game mania of the modern-day world is not however, restricted to its fetish for the unreal. It is also the huge level of self-actualization and gratification that a gamer feels when he catches them all as the catch phrase for any Pokémon game reminds us. Within the human brain is the reward system which is responsible for desire, pleasure and positive reinforcement. When rewardedsay with virtual monsters or other awardsthe brain releases a compound called dopamine which encodes information about the salience, value, and context of a reward. This reward system is the one which induces appetitive or consummatory behaviour. Psychological theories like operant conditioning say that the frequency of a behaviour will increase if rewarded and decrease if penalized. Other theories such as the one given by Wolfram Schultz propounds that unexpected rewards or rewards greater than expected can also increase dopamine levels.The most popular video games of the past few years such as Diablo and World of Warcraft have been known to capitalize on this reward-seeking mentality of the human brain. Pokémon Go provides all the key ingredients responsible for activating the reward systemgratification, fast pace and unpredictability. The key towards maintaining the public interest in the game in future will also lie in these very ingredients.Meanwhile, another gameto monetize Pokémon Gois already emerging in the backdrop. Ad agencies are already neck-deep in research to find out ways to lure customers to nearby shops and restaurants from PokéStops. According to an article in the Financial Times, Niantics previous release Ingress which also involved virtual portals mapped on streets had found good commercial footing owing to the willingness of retailers and service providers to pay for promotions in the game. Pokémon Go too shows similar, if not higher potential. The trick is to reap the benefits before the crescendo dies.

				We propose to create an integrated public sector oil major which will be able to match the performance of international and domestic private sector oil and gas companies, said Jaitley in his budget speech.International firms such as ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell plc and BP Plc have integrated operations across upstream exploration, refining and fuel retail.The Indian governments move comes in the backdrop of concerns articulated over rising oil prices presenting a challenge to the countrys growth. The price of crude oil in the Indian energy basket has increased from $39.9 in April 2016 to $52.7 in December 2016.The Indian energy basket represents the average of Oman, Dubai and Brent crude. The price was $54.63 per barrel on Friday.The state-owned firms in the oil and gas sector are; Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC), Oil India Ltd, GAIL (India) Ltd, Indian Oil Corp., Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Numaligarh Refinery Ltd, Chennai Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Engineers India Ltd,  Balmer Lawrie & Co. Ltd, and Biecco Lawrie Co. Ltd.We see opportunities to strengthen our CPSEs (central public sector enterprises) through consolidation, mergers and acquisitions. By these methods, the CPSEs can be integrated across the value chain of an industry. It will give them capacity to bear higher risks, avail economies of scale, take higher investment decisions and create more value for the stakeholders. Possibilities of such restructuring are visible in the oil and gas sector, Jaitley said.The concern over crude oil prices stems from Indias energy import bill of around $150 billion, expected to reach $300 billion by 2030. India imports around 80% of its crude oil and 18% of its natural gas requirements. India imported 202 million tonnes of oil in 2015-16.The state owned firms welcomed the move.Though the finer details are yet to come but the intention appears to form an integrated company on the lines of integrated oil firms such as ExxonMobil, Shell and BP, said Dinesh K. Sarraf, chairman and managing director, ONGC.This also comes at a time of faltering domestic crude oil and gas production and output cuts announced by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec). India is one of the major consumers of Opecs production, with the grouping accounting for 85% and 94% of Indias crude oil and gas imports.Indias energy demand growth is expected to outpace the other BRIC (Brazil, Russia, China, India) countries, according to the latest BP Energy Outlook released last week.The new entity will have economies of scale and Indian industrys negotiating power globally will increase significantly.

Its Ebitda of Rs515.8 crore was much higher than the Streets estimates. For instance, Kotak Institutional Equities and Edelweiss Securities Ltd were expecting the Ebitda at Rs430 crore. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.ALSO READ | Zee Entertainments profit up 8.6% at Rs250.8 croreA decline in costs led to this improvement, as overall revenue growth was just 3.4% compared to a year ago.

In comparison, it had increased 15.7% and 19%, respectively, in the September and June quarters.According to the company, advertising revenue growth during the first 40 days of the quarter, i.e. pre-demonetisation, was similar to the growth seen in the half year ended September. What offers some comfort is that Zee Entertainments December quarter ad revenue performance was better than some analysts expectations. For instance, Kotak and Edelweiss were expecting ad revenue growth of 2% and 1%, respectively.Subscription revenue, accounting for 36% of total revenue, increased 13.7%, helped by closure of content deals with a few large distribution platform operators during the quarter. Subscription revenue included some catch-up revenues for the previous quarters. After a good quarter, much depends on how advertising shapes up. According to Mihir Modi, chief finance and strategy officer at Zee Entertainment, while advertising growth is better than November and December, it hasnt gone back to pre-demonetisation days.For the next six-eight months, Modi expects telecom and auto sectors to give impetus to advertising growth. The push from the telecom sector will be driven by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd while automobile launches will boost auto sector growth.Zee Entertainments shares have outperformed the benchmark Sensex so far this fiscal year.

				Rami Rahim, an M.Sc. in electrical engineering from Stanford University and a Juniper veteran, has risen through the ranks to his current role of chief executive officer. In an interview, he talks about the changing digital landscape, the evolution of software-defined networking and the impact of cloud computing. Excerpts: Why did you feel the need to come up with another term, digital cohesion, when digital transformation already exists?The idea behind digital cohesion is to paint a vision of the future that people can relate to. When you talk about some of the advances in technology, in networking for example, while our partners, customers and stakeholders understand it inherently, but for a broader set of population, it is a bit difficult to relate to because they are not in this business. So digital cohesion paints an exciting vision of the future around technology and applications playing an interesting and important part in our day-to-day lives, of how these will come together to create truly life-enhancing experiences. And then to distil it down to a set of technology barriers that must be overcome in order for that vision to become a reality. Doing this makes the motivation to overcome those barriers really compelling.What will digital cohesion do that digital transformation wont?Digital transformation is typically around changes in business and technology, how these two come together to create new business opportunities through more agility and business efficiency. Digital cohesion is different: its coming together of applications and services to solve really interesting problems in the consumer and the business space. But both are important concepts.You have envisioned a world in which self-assembling apps will provide predictive, personalized services to people. Dont you think this will further increase the risk to personal privacy and data security? Right, this is one of the big barriers to this future in which the applications are always on in the background, as the mega cloud providers and service providers will need to collect a lot of information to be able to act on it. That can only happen when a lot of thought has been put into privacy policies and cyber security. As more and more applications are going to be connected, each of those connections presents an opening for the bad actors to come in and compromise the network and thus user data. We believe it will require a fundamentally different architectural approach to do what is necessary to improve the overall security posture of the network. What is the update on software-defined networking (SDN)?Any new technology or architecture goes through a hype cycle and SDN has gone through that cycle. About a year or so back, SDN was touted as the answer to most networking problems but that clearly is not the case. One should understand that software has always played a very important role in networking. In the past, our software and hardware systems were very tightly integrated but now they are loosely coupled and we are already offering software separately. Also, networking-as-a-service will add more value to the domain.At one point, Juniper was broad-basing its customer segment from telecom operators to other enterprises. But now with cloud coming up in a big way, most enterprises may not be buying networking gear at all. How is Juniper coping with this situation?The cloud is the single biggest trend that is impacting our industry and therefore our strategy today as a company. There are many types of companies in the cloud market, including the mega cloud companies, software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service players, co-location hosting providers and many others. This segment has been a very important part of our business and, over the past several years, revenue from these companies has double as a percentage of our total revenue. We are also helping telecom operators transform and grow their cloud, in addition to helping enterprises with a hybrid architecture in connecting their own data centres to the cloud. The approaching Internet of Things (IoT) world and your vision of digital cohesion will put a lot of strain on networks. What role will Juniper play here?I think IoT and 5G (fifth generation mobile technology) are both going to be cloud-native technologies. This means the services to the end consumers will be developed in a virtualized manner and delivered from a data centre. That is what we believe we are most suited forto provide the cloud infrastructure and solutions for data centres, wide area networks and the software that helps our customers in tapping into the cloud data centres with ease and agility.",2016-12-22,5a2p4CTEMC5oR85Il3Jx4J,"The cloud is the single biggest trend that is impacting our industry and therefore our strategy today as a company, says Juniper CEO Rami Rahim",both,00:58,Cloud is the biggest trend impacting networking industry: Juniper CEO

-0.8,"Weather, access and traffic make India an ideal market for e-commerce.
				   
				Growing Internet access, largely through smartphones, and the increasing emphasis on cashless transactions make it a potentially lucrative market for e-commerce.The countrys sheer size and its population make it a potentially big market for e-commerce.Not surprisingly, Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal are battling it out for supremacy in this market, estimated to be worth $38 billion this year, according to industry lobby group Assocham. Still, success will be more a function of how these three deal with the regulatory and market conditions than how they do with each other.Indias policy regarding foreign investment in retail is fluid. On paper, the country allows foreign investment in supermarkets and department stores, although this policy was crafted by the earlier government and the current dispensation in New Delhi, while not keen to undo a reformist policy, has made it clear that it will not sign off on any applications. Its policy on e-commerce is just a little more complex. India allows 100% foreign direct investment in marketplaces, which provide a technology, payment and delivery platform that connects buyers and sellers. And it places curbs on the extent any one seller can dominate the marketplace, and on discounts.The regulatory regime is likely transient. India should, sooner than later, allow foreign investment in supermarkets and also in e-commerce sites that are hybrid models allowing direct retail and serving as a marketplace (Amazon follows this model in many countries, including the US). But until then, the challenge for Amazon, Flipkart, and Snapdeal is not to fall foul of it. The situation is exacerbated by traditional retailers who have taken both the legal and the lobbying route to prevent the march of the marketplaces. Some of this opposition comes from small so-called kirana or mom-and-pop stores. And some definitely comes from Indian Big Retail that would like some protection against deep-pocketed marketplaces. Indeed, a Nielsen report in 2015 showed that online retail in India is growing more at the expense of modern and organized retail than at the cost of kirana stores.Thats the first challenge. The second is to build a brand and, through that, brand loyalty. Through 2014 and 2015, the marketplaces have been big advertisers on TV and in print, proof that the ability of the digital medium to build brands is still suspect. Despite that, none has managed to build brand loyalty. In part, the marketplaces themselves are to blame.They have used their capital, including venture capital, to fund discountsto such an extent that many shoppers have been conditioned to expect significant discounts, sometimes in excess of 50%. To be sure, many have now gone slow on such sales, and will likely go slower, given the new government policy. The brand, and brand loyalty challenge remain.The third is to get the supply chain and customer service rightnot the easiest thing to do when millions of products are being sold to millions of customers across a few hundred cities and towns. Of the three marketplaces, only Amazon seems to have really focused on this, and the results are there for all to see. Still, its far too early to pick a winner.",2016-05-20,5sQ3isGn4ntbSC4SRPWV2I,"Success will be more a function of how Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal deal with the regulatory and market conditions than how they do with each other

				Five out of the seven public sector banks that reported quarterly results on Friday made a loss and the profit-makers, State Bank of India (SBI) and Oriental Bank of Commerce, showed a worse bad loan ratio. But their shares surged, with SBI rising more than 7%, and Bank of India gaining over 10%. Here are a few reasons why investors believe theres value in bank stocks, despite the rash of bad loans.Falling rate of slippages: This is one of the clearest signs that public sector banks are getting a grip on the bad loan problem. Lenders labelled a massive Rs.1.5 trillion worth of loans as non-performing in the March quarter. In the June quarter, the addition has come down to Rs.50,000 crore. This is something investors are cheering.Provisions: Banks have provided for most of the big troubled accounts in the March quarter, courtesy the Reserve Bank of Indias asset quality review. Provisions have halved for the 25 public sector lenders in the June quarter. Sure, some more skeletons may tumble out of the cupboard. But these are unlikely to be of the magnitude of provisions made in the March quarter. What do lower provisions mean? Higher profits, of course.Retail loan growth: Barring big banks such as SBI and Bank of Baroda, public sector lenders were slow to wake up to Indias consumption story. But now, every public sector bank has announced its plan to focus on retail lending. Rising retail consumption, which is fuelled by personal loans, could well pull them out of their credit abyss. Retail loan growth at Bank of India was 13%, at Union Bank of India 14% and that at SBI 20% in the June quarter.Merge or perish: For the public sector lenders to survive, some will have to die. The government is more open now than before for consolidation that would create a handful of strong and valuable lenders. A start is the merger of its associates with SBI. It will be tricky to forecast a turnaround in the fortunes of banks, although some bankers say this could happen in the first quarter of 2017-18.  Barring SBI, all public sector lenders have a price-to-book value ratio of below one. Until the dust settles, these rock-bottom valuations will keep calling to investors.",2016-08-15,5yRFwAXonxqCjpTtnGYJxN,"To foretell the timing of the turnaround of the public sector banks is tricky, although bankers insist that this would happen as early as the first quarter of FY18

0.1,"Seoul: Billionaire Shin Dong-joo has reason to be bitter. In the past couple of years, hes been suspended by his father, fired by his younger brother and indicted on charges of embezzlement by South Korean prosecutors.
				   
				Yet the former No. 2 at Lotte Group says hes confident hell clear his name in court, overthrow his brother as chairman and seize control of a business empire that generates more revenue than Google Inc. or Airbus Group. His plan is to take advantage of the groups complex network of more than 70 cross shareholdings. If he can gain the votes of minority shareholders in one Japanese unit that binds the whole conglomerate together, he says he can effectively control the group.My final target is to take control of Lotte, Shin, 62, said in his office in Seoul in his first interview with foreign media. My brother and the current management destroyed (Lottes) good corporate culture.Shin is attempting to pull off a unique coup in Korean corporate historythe takeover of one of the countrys giant family-run business groups, known as the chaebol. If he succeeds, hell take charge of the nations largest chain of shopping malls, duty-free stores, hotels and amusement parks, one whose overseas assets include Guylian Belgian chocolates and New Yorks Palace Hotel. ALSO READ: Lotte scraps $4.5 billion hotel IPO as probes deepen crisisCoup attemptsIts a big if. His brother Shin Dong-bin, chairman of Lotte Group, outguns him in terms of resources and has already fended off numerous coup attempts. The brothers given names will be used in this article for clarity.No coup has ever succeeded among the chaebol, said Chung Sun-sup, CEO of Chaebul.com, a website that tracks the chaebol. He said Dong-joos best chance would be if his brother was convicted as a result of the investigation this year into corruption at the company. Dong-joo has also been charged but both brothers deny the allegations. Meanwhile, the family feud is hurting Lotte and has added another stain to the embattled reputation of the chaebol groups this year, which have already suffered the bankruptcy of Hanjin Shipping Co., Samsung Electronics Co.s exploding phones and an influence-peddling scandal that cost President Park Geun-hye her job.The battle at Lotte is among the fiercest corporate power struggles in Asia -- rivaling the brawl raging atop Indias Tata Group -- as some of the regions biggest dynasties undergo a once-in-a-generation leadership change.Lotte was founded seven decades ago by Shin Kyuk-ho in Japan, where he had earlier attended Waseda University. He started out selling chewing gum and built a business empire in Japan and Korea. The two brothers grew up together in Japan, with the elder learning to run the Japanese units and the younger taking charge of the Korean part.The trouble began when the ailing patriarch, now 94, fired his eldest son Dong-joo in January 2015 and took away some of his voting rights. Dong-joo says he was removed because the president of Lotte Holdings, Takayuki Tsukuda, falsely told his father that he was responsible for causing losses. Dong-joo said the accusations were part of a plan to wrest control of the company.Fathers forgivenessThe first thing for me to do was to persuade my father about the real situation, Dong-joo said. It took several months to change his mind.He did. In July 2015, the patriarch flew to Tokyo to overturn the dismissal but was thwarted when Dong-bin, Tsukuda and Chief Financial Officer Masamoto Kobayashi refused to meet him, according to a copy of testimony Dong-joo gave to Korean prosecutors earlier this year. The next day, the trio called an emergency board meeting and ousted the groups founder as the head of Lotte Holdings.Lotte Holdings declined to comment on any of the ousted executives allegations and wouldnt make Tsukuda or Kobayashi available for comment.Lotte Group said in a statement to Bloomberg News that Dong-joo was fired because he made unauthorized investments in a software venture that led to about 1 billion yen ($8.7 million) in losses. Lotte Chairman Dong-bin, 61, wasnt available for an interview, the group said.To insist one should be able to reclaim the company just because hes the owners son shows he has an outdated perspective and sees the company as a personal belonging Lotte said. Dong-joo is remorseless and lacks managerial competence, according to the statement.China expansionDong-joo said his brother is the one who is shortsighted. Dong-bin should be blamed for changing Lottes culture to one where managers constantly fear getting fired, he said. He also blamed Dong-bins expansion in China for what he estimated to be 2.4 trillion won ($2.1 billion) in losses for the group.The best players come to China and fight like at the Olympics, Dong-joo said in an interview in the Gran Seoul building, a block away from Lottes headquarters in the South Korean capital. The current management team underestimated the situation. Timeline of events that have roiled Lottes Shin familyLotte couldnt confirm the amount of the China losses. It said that Dong-bin is a proven leader who increased the groups annual sales to about 90 trillion won, from 26 trillion won in 2004, and pushed for the listing of Lotte Shopping Co. to enhance transparency. The chairman has a strategy to enhance group transparency and become a better corporate citizen, it said.As to Dong-joo, his strategy centers around Lotte Holdings Co., the closely held Tokyo-based company that owns about 99% of Hotel Lotte Co., which in turn controls the conglomerates scores of businesses in Korea. He argues that the best way to improve the groups governance issues would be a public share sale of the holding company.Dong-joo commands 33.3% of votes at Lotte Holdings, theoretically giving him a larger say than the 22.3% directly controlled by the Japanese executives. But there is also a 31% block of shares owned by 130 employees that is represented by a single union delegate whos been siding with Dong-bin. Should the delegates vote be broken up, Dong-joo said he could get the majority he needs.Dong-joo declined to specify how hed change the employee voting system, which was set up by his father decades ago, but said there are legal steps that his team is working on. His supporters include Min Euoo-sung, 62, the former Korea Development Bank chairman who placed a failed bid for Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. before its bankruptcy, and Cho Moon-hyun, an attorney at DW Partners.Lotte said the employee union sided with Dong-bin in light of his managerial skills, while Dong-joo should be ashamed of losing the support of the Lotte Holdings staff. Union representatives werent available to comment.Dong-joo says his brother is only a pawn in a battle being controlled by Tsukuda and Kobayashi. As he tells it, the majority of votes at Lotte Holdings are effectively controlled by the Japanese executives as his younger brother only holds 1.6% of the voting rights.They can fire my brother anytime, Dong-joo said. My brothers position is not stable. While the brothers feud rages, Lotte is facing other crises.Corruption indictmentsIn October, South Korean prosecutors indicted five members of the family, including both brothers and their father, after a four-month investigation, accusing the Shin clan of engaging in financial crimes amounting to almost 280 billion won. Dong-joo was also charged with embezzling 39 billion won, which he denies. Lotte Group said most of the allegations against his brother, Dong-bin, involve events during the time their father was running the group. Other family members could not be reached for comment.Separately, Dong-bin had to answer allegations from parliament, along with other chaebol leaders, that Lotte and the other big business groups gave bribes to foundations controlled by Choi Soon-sil, the confidante of impeached Korean President Parkaccusations Dong-bin and Lotte Group deny.The scandals have taken a toll on Lottes businesses. The company scrapped a potential $4.5 billion initial public offering of a hotel unit and withdrew a multi-billion-dollar bid for chemicals-maker Axiall Corp. Prior to its deals freeze, Lotte was the most active Korean conglomerate in terms of mergers and acquisitions over the past six years, according to corporate watchdog CEOScore.For Dong-joo, the crises at Lotte are representative of what he says are managements missteps. He says he has a message for his estranged brother, with whom he hasnt spoken in months. Youd better apologize to my father and come back to Shin family, Dong-joo said. As a family, we should be united. BloombergGrace Huang also contributed to this story.",2016-12-16,644n0DkZZlIjzpFHzGm9bN,"Billionaire Shin Dong-joo says hes confident hell clear his name in court, overthrow his brother as chairman and seize control of Lotte Group that generates more revenue than Google or Airbus ",company,18:58,Inside a banished Korean billionaires plot to overthrow his brother

0.09,"Over the past few years, several policymakers have been heard complaining that Indian firms are not investing enough. The latest data on asset sales provides a clear and stark answer for that phenomenon: the Indian economy is currently going through the biggest deleveraging of the past quarter century, if not the biggest in history.
				   
				Data sourced from Thomson Reuters Eikon show that Indian companies have sold more assets in 2016 than they have in any year since liberalization. It is no wonder then that private investments have been tepid as the deleveraging process picked up pace over the past year or so. The data shows that asset-sale deals announced, pending or completed in 2016 are worth $40.85 billion. This beats the previous peak of $27.96 billion announced in 2007 by a wide margin. The Reuters data covers any tangible asset, branch, division, operations or subsidiary sold off by a parent firm.While the previous peak was driven by demand from investors who wanted a stake in the India growth story, the current round of asset sales has been driven largely by distress of indebted corporations. Essar features in the list of top deals in both 2007 and 2016. The top deals in 2007 include Vodafones acquisition of Hutchison Essar and Matsushita Electric Works acquisition of Anchor Electricals. The top deals of 2016 include the sale of controlling stake in Essar Oil to PJSC Rosneft Oil Co by the heavily indebted Essar group, and UltraTech Cement Ltds acquisition of Jaypee Groups cement assets. However, in terms of completed deals, 2016 has seen lower amount of such deals compared to previous years but that is largely because many of the asset sales are yet to receive regulatory approvals.As the charts below show, the asset sales have been led by stressed firms in the debt-laden sectors of the Indian economy such as energy, real estate, and metals. Many of the leading firms in these sectors are owned by some of the most indebted corporate groups of the country.The debt overhang of Indias corporate sector has been many years in the making and the unwinding of debt is taking almost as much time as the accumulation of debt. The seeds of the current debt problems were sown during the effervescent lending of the boom years in the mid-2000s. The credit boom leading up to the great global financial crash of 2008 witnessed a dilution of lending norms by banks and an aggressive asset-buying spree by Indian corporations. The financial crash brought an end to such excesses, and the boom turned to bust. In a 2012 report, Credit Suisse pointed out that the borrowings of the top 10 indebted conglomerates in the country (which included Essar, Reliance ADAG, Vedanta, Adani and the Jaypee group) had grown five times in the five years leading up to 2012 to Rs5.4 trillion, which equalled 13% of total bank loans.Even then, delayed recognition of bad loans by banks and regulatory forbearance by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) ensured that indebted firms and conglomerates did not face the pressures of paying back their debts that they are faced with today. In a 2015 update of their original report, Credit Suisse pointed out that the total borrowings of the top 10 indebted groups stood at Rs7.3 trillion.Thanks to tightening of norms related to restructuring of assets, and greater power provided to lenders to recover dues, promoters have been forced to consider selling distressed assets and subsidiaries to retire some of their debt. Some of the top deals of the past year feature firms owned by the top 10 indebted corporate groups and other large indebted conglomerates.But does this years asset-selling spree signal an end to Indias debt woes? Most analysts suggest that is unlikely. In fact, the debt problem has become more acute for companies which are not able to meet their interest obligations or have an interest cover less than 1. Contrary to expectations of a recovery in stressed companies, the share of debt with interest cover (IC) saw a slight increase up to 39% vs 38%. The share of chronically stressed companies also increased to 34% vs 32% QoQ, and 30% (vs 34%) debt was with loss-making companies, noted a 19 September Credit Suisse report by analysts Ashish Gupta, Kush Shah and Prashant Kumar. Bankers have pointed out that cash from many asset sales is only enough to stay out of debt trouble for a year or so. And once cash-generating assets have been sold, it could lead to fresh problems for indebted groups as the cash from the deals run out. It is likely that bankers or promoters, or more likely both, would have to take a hit in the coming quarters. A 20 September Religare Capital Markets Ltd report, which examined six steel companies to analyse their debt servicing capability, noted that EBITDA (or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) would have to triple for these companies to be able to meet their debt obligations. Given the limited upsides to EBITDA (ex-sale of non-core assets), we believe debt servicing will be possible only post a 35-40% loan haircut by banks, said the report authored by analysts Pritesh Jani, Parag Jariwala and Vikesh Mehta. The continuing spectre of further deleveraging seems to have affected risk appetite across the economy. As the chart below shows, cash levels have witnessed a rise for Indian firms after the crash of 2008 even though indebted firms have lagged others. Yet, the hangover of debt and the turning of the credit cycle seems to be deterring firms from making new investments.The tepid investment climate has affected overall demand in the economy and in turn hurt the debt-servicing capabilities of the indebted groups, analysts say.Indias debt issues will not be solved without an improvement in growth or a pick-up in demand, said V. Balasubramanian, head of equities at IDBI Mutual Fund.The problem is huge, said Balasubramanian.

-0.4,"New Delhi: Winter heating to counter a severe cold wave sweeping across north India has driven up power demand beyond what was seen in previous years, sending power distributors in the region scurrying to negotiate arrangements to prepare for contingencies.
				   
				Delhis peak power demand this winter is expected to be around 4,500-4,600 mega watt (MW), compared to around 4,125MW a year ago, according to a spokesperson for two units of BSES promoted by Reliance Infrastructure Ltd supplying power in the National Capital Region (NCR). Peak winter power demand in NCR which has steadily risen from 3,678MW in 2010, has already crossed last years winter peak. Last summer, peak demand had touched 6,188MW in the capital on 20 May, about a quarter more than the peak summer demand around the same time a year ago. Energy demand peaks in mornings and early night hours compared to the average level of supply and forms a component in the electricity tariff to the consumer. It makes sense for a consumer to keep her peak demand lower as power generation companies have to  invest in extra capacity required to service the peak demand which remains idle at other times. According to Praveer Sinha, chief executive officer and managing director at Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd, Delhi may see a rise in winter peak power demand as compared to previous years due to the persistent cold wave. We all are experiencing a dip in the temperature to the coldest minimum since 2013, which has led to the increase in demand. At Tata Power-DDL, we have made prior arrangements to meet the rising demand...We have tied up through long-term power supply, banking as well as procurement on short term though the exchange, said Sinha.ALSO READ | Indias five hottest years since 1901 came in past 15 years, IMD data showsPower banking is a barter system of supplying excess power available to a distribution company to a counterpart which can be sourced back at another season at no cost. Distribution firms serving in plains strike such deals with those in hill states where power demand is more in winter and less in summer.Besides long-term arrangements, we are also using techniques like banking and backdown to dispose of surplus power and making arrangements to get power during summer months. In case of any unforeseeable contingency, BSES discoms will buy short-term power from the exchange which is available at economical rates, said the company spokesperson. BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd will bank the surplus of around 200MW with states like Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Meghalaya. BSES Yamuna Power Ltd (BYPL) has arranged for an additional 150MW from Punjab for December and January. To reduce the night surplus, BYPL will supply around 175MW to Bihar between December and March, said the spokesperson. This year, winter came late in the north and central parts of India. Two sets of cold waves, first between 11-15 January and the second between 18-19 January led to a severe fall in temperature across many parts of north and central India. In the first spell, Delhis minimum temperature dropped to 3.4 degrees Celsius on 12 January, the lowest in January in three years. Churu in Rajasthan recorded a minimum temperature of -1.9°C, seven degrees below average, making it the coldest city in the country on 12 January.According to India Meteorological Department, another cold wave will grip the northern parts of the country in the next few days which would lead to a fall in temperature.

				But this was more than 25 years ago, when he was yet to get acquainted with wine. Today, he is the chief executive of Sula Vineyards, Indias largest producer of wine, with a 60% market share. We meet in the lobby of a hotel in New Delhi Aerocity and settle down for a chat over cappuccinos and cookies.Sula will crush more than 13,000 tonnes of grapes in 2016, up 20% from last year, according to the company. Samant says they are well on track to sell one million cases in 2016-17.We continue to be the pioneers of the Indian wine industry. Every two years or so, we come out with a new wine that nobody has produced before, says Samant. We now export to more than 25 countries and are listed on the menus of Michelin-star restaurants. It says a lot about the quality that we have sustained over time.Yet there are new, urgent challenges. Global warming and climate change are among the biggest, he says.Sustainability is the companys primary focus area todayreducing waste, reusing and recycling its topmost goals. It has recently appointed a chief sustainability officer. Every inch of the roof of our Nashik plant is covered with solar panels, says Samant. About 40% of our power consumption comes from solar energy. We want it to reach 70% in the near future.Water conservation is his next target.In April, the Maharashtra government declared drought in 27,723 of the states 43,000 villages. Scanty rainfall and erratic weather patterns in the recent past have affected Sulas production as well. We recycle every single drop of water we use. But there is a long way to go, says Samant.Sustainability is an essential but a very new concept in India, he says. In fact, India is one of the major resistors at global climate change negotiations. We have to start changing our position. We have to find a way to reach our economic goals while being sustainable. India is one of the main sufferers of global warming, says Samant.Wine is particularly susceptible to the challenges of global warming because grapes are delicate, dependent heavily on the terroir of the place where they are grown. The soil is very important. It needs to be a good mix of clay, silt and sand. If its very deep clay, it is that much harder. Wine grapes love the Mediterranean climatewarm days, cool nights, dry weather, not too much rain, says Samant. *****Samant vividly remembers tasting the first bottle of wine that Sula produced, in 2000. I was sitting with Kerry (Kerry Damskey, the master winemaker from California who helps Samant in winemaking) on the veranda of our Nashik home. Are you ready? he asked. I nodded. And then he poured. The wine was cloudy. It was unfiltered. It was the first fermentation. But it tasted amazing. It was the best white wine made in India.It was the result of painstaking work done through a decade full of indecision, wandering, research, learning and perseverance.In 1991, Samant joined Oracle in Silicon Valley as finance manager but quit two years later. For a year, he backpacked through the US, Asia and India, before returning home to Mumbai in 1994 and asking his father for a job. He refused. Rajeevs father Suresh Samant owns Samson Maritime, a maritime and oil services firm. But my father said he would support me if I did anything on my own, says Samant. My father is a first-generation entrepreneur. Entrepreneurship, therefore, is in my DNA. Samant did decide to do something on his own. What, he did not know then. It was in Nashik that Samant found his calling. His father wanted to sell some land he owned. Samant asked him not to and started experimenting with organic farming. He grew roses, tomatoes and teakwood but soon realized that the infrastructure and economics were not with me there; organic farming is labour- and cost-intensive and unless it was done on a large scale, it wouldnt be profitable. He also realized that while Nashik was a cradle for table grapes, nobody was making wine. In that moment, everything came together, he says. Samant started growing table grapes in 1995 and wine grapes in 1996-97. The first crush was done in 1999.  Sula was founded in 1999, with Rs3-4 crore in seed capital, on the 20-acre plot that his family owned. The money came from family, friends and banks. We had to mortgage everything, says Samant. If the wine business didnt work, we could lose all of the Rs3 crore and some more. It was all or nothing. Today, Sula is worth more than Rs1,000 crore and buys grapes from 3,000 acres of vineyards, mostly under contract farming. Its wines are priced from Rs250-1,750 in Maharashtra. The medium-bodied, food-friendly Sula Cabernet Shiraz, the herbaceous, crisp and dry Sula Sauvignon Blanc, and the semi-dry Sula Chenin Blanc that works as a delightful aperitif are some of Sulas best-sellers. Samant says Maharashtra, Karnataka, Delhi and Goa are their biggest markets.I had never thought Sula would become this big, he says.Not surprisingly, he is now primarily a wine drinker. I have wine fridges at home and I have all my Sula wines there as well as the wines that we import, such as Hardys and Cono Sur. When he wants a break from wine, he falls back on the old favourite: a good gin and tonic with a dash of nostalgia. *****Sula has put Nashik on the world map, says Samant. Some people might disagree, but, in my opinion, Nashik didnt exist before Sula, he says. Today, Sula has the biggest non-religious tourist site in Maharashtra. We had 230,000 visitors last year.The company has also transformed the surrounding villages, providing a livelihood to locals. In Sawargaon village, at least one person from every family works for us in some way. We have among the highest proportion of tribals in our workforce. I just hope this can be sustained, says Samant.Samant is upbeat about the future. Consumption has been growing at about 20% every year for the past couple of years, and we have still only seen the tip of the iceberg. Wine is still less than 1% of the total alcohol consumption in India, and I see no reason why the industry shouldnt grow at about 10-15% every year in the next decade. There is a lot of potential for brands to grow. It is a great time to be in the business.So where does he sees Sula in, say, a decade from now? I dont know. If someone had predicted 10 years ago that I would reach here, I would have laughed at them, Samant says. Now I dont know where the limit is.",2016-09-23,6InfSbJq3ObxfblrwddaoL,Sula Vineyards CEO Rajeev Samant on his journey from Napa Valley to Nashik and the challenges that remain,company,15:19,Rajeev Samant: The Winemaker
-0.49,"Its hard to quibble with the continued success of Googles advertising business. Already the dominant company in the $200 billion annual market for web and mobile commercials, Google parent company Alphabet Inc. padded its advertising revenue by about $12 billion from 2015 to 2016. That means in a single year, Google found new business that was equivalent to half of Facebooks total yearly sales. But there is a potentially dark cloud in Googles sunny skies.
				   
				About 70% of Alphabets total revenue last year came from the ads that the company sells on its own digital properties, including Google web search pages, YouTube, Gmail and Google Maps. The rest of Googles advertising revenue comes from the companys role as a middleman for ads all over the web and mobile devices.Revenue from the ad network rose 4% in 2016, while ad sales on Googles websites and apps rose 22%. The slower growth of Googles ad network means it is accounting for a smaller and smaller share of the companys total sales. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Googles advertising network generated 17% of Alphabets total revenue, down from 22% three years earlier.The reasons for this are complicated. Digital advertising is changing. More ad sales are entirely computerized, pushing down the average prices for each ad and pinching Googles growth in its advertising network. The digital advertising business is growing more concentrated; a larger share of industry revenue is coming from ads sold on the websites and apps controlled by two companies, Google and Facebook Inc.Right now, though, the soft spot in Googles advertising network sales is no big deal. Google is more than making up the difference with prodigious growth in ad sales on its own websites.But in Googles worst-case scenario, it faces every Internet companys worst fear: it could turn into Yahoo Inc.Yahoo in its heyday had the most popular hangouts on the web, including its home page. And it had at the time the leading technology for serving up banner ads to the millions of people who used Yahoo as the front door to the Internet. Then, Yahoos Internet stardom faded. And its technology didnt keep pace with changes in online advertising. The combination of failures meant dependence on ad sales from its own websites proved painful as those Internet visitors moved to other sites and to their smartphones.Thats not to say Google will follow Yahoos path to Internet ignominy. Google is the best Internet ad machine ever created, with the best technology to harness untold reams of information about peoples habits to feed into it. But the relatively slow growth of Googles advertising machine away from its own digital walls do leave the company potentially vulnerable.If search, YouTube, Google Maps and other company properties fade in popularity, then Google will have fewer digital billboard spots to apply its advertising prowess. Technology changes quickly and can turn todays Internet stars into tomorrows Internet losers. Googles advertising strength in its web homes could someday become its dystopian nightmare.",2017-01-30,6JAQ0Oi2Emhuyi1aAJ4MTI,Googles advertising strength in its web homes could someday become its dystopian nightmare,competitor,02:10,The chink in Googles ad armour
0.12,"New Delhi: Indias rapidly growing payment industry is seeking easier entry norms for non-banking entities to install credit and debit card swiping machines at merchant outlets that will foster competition and cut down user charges, a goal the government is pursuing to tide over the cash crunch induced by recall of high-value currency notes. 
				   
				Payment companies are also pitching for lower tax on income generated through digital transactions.Executives, however, cautioned that any artificial reduction of merchant discount rate (MDR) on credit and debit cards payment through legislation will not work as it will affect the cost-benefit balance of issuing swiping machines. Both banks and non-banking entities such as PayU, Mswipe, Ezetap and Oxigen issue swiping machines but the market is dominated by banks.The chief ministers panel on digital payments led by Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu had on Tuesday disapproved of MDR levy by card issuers and recommended to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to lower or eliminate MDR for all digital payments to government entities. The panel also recommended that Aadhaar-enabled payment systems which rely on biometrics should be incentivized rather than discouraged by charging MDR.Naveen Surya, chairman, Payments Council of India (PCI), an industry body working closely with the government and the RBI, said artificial controls do no good and advocated for a level-playing field.The market should be opened up to a larger number of non-banking entities allowing installation of point-of-sale (POS) machines, he said.If the market is opened, more and more entities will supply and charges will drop automatically. Lowering the charge without scale will have a negative impact,added Surya, who is also the managing director of ItzCash Card Ltd.The government on Tuesday provided highlights of the panels recommendations, but did not release the complete report. The highlights said that per capita cashless transactions by non-banks a year in India was merely 11 compared to 728 in Singapore, 355 in the UK and 142 in Brazil.It is very essential to find revenue alternatives not dependent on MDR i.e. using smartphones for payments, which requires low capital expenditure for the payment infrastructure, said Sunil Kulkarni, deputy managing director, Oxigen Services (India) Pvt. Ltd, a payment company.Surya said that tax rates applicable to the merchants should be lowered as their revenue from digital transactions increases.The RBI had already lowered the MDR rates on December 16. The MDR for debit card payments, including for payments made to government, was capped at 0.25% for transactions up to Rs1,000 and 0.5% between Rs1,000-2,000.However, there is no RBI cap on MDR on credit card payments. RBI said reduced charges will come into effect from 1 January 2017 and shall be applicable till 31 March 2017.The existing MDR cap before January 1was 0.75% for transactions up to Rs2,000 and 1% for over Rs2,000.According to a July, 2016 report by the Boston Consultancy Group, market for cashless payments will grow 10 times by 2020 to reach $500 billion.

-0.62,"Tough negotiations are under way between GAIL (India) Ltd and two bidding groups that applied to charter nine new liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers required by the state-run gas processor and distributor for shipping gas from the US.
				   
				The intense bargaining is over the three LNG tankers that are to be built in India as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modis Make in India programme. The two consortiums comprising mainly Japanese fleet owners with a strong presence in LNG shipping want GAIL or the government to take on potential risks associated with the Indian-built LNG tankers, which would be the first such sophisticated ships built locally. GAIL doesnt want to assume the risks and is waiting for the government to take a position.A consortium of Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd (MOL)-Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha Ltd (NYK Line) and Mitsui and Co. Ltd and another group comprising Mitsubishi Corp.-Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd (K Line)-GasLog Ltd and Foresight Ltd are eyeing the long-term deal because of its sheer sizeworth around $7 billion. Such long-term shipping contracts translate into huge cost savings for GAIL and for the end-use consumers of LNG, a clean source of fuel which India is seeking to rely on to cut carbon emissions.Executives briefed on the tender issued by GAIL for the second time in two years (the first one failed because no one showed up), says there was an attempt by global shipowners to scuttle the bidding process and the Make in India plan by putting conditions that either GAIL or the government may find it difficult to accept.Conversations with these executives, who declined to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media, gives an insight into the role played by local representatives (mostly looking after crewing and other ship agency functions and not well versed with ship construction) of bidding groups in influencing their top bosses in the Tokyo headquarters on the perils of building LNG ships in India and to avoid taking perceived risks associated with this. A GAIL executive summed this up pretty well by saying that the company faced more resistance in pursuing the tender from the local representatives of the bidding groups than from senior executives based in Japan.To illustrate the point, a local representative with one of the bidding groups voiced concern during a meeting on the possible de-hiring of Indian-built LNG ships by GAIL, citing the example of Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd, which a few months ago prematurely cancelled contracts on ships taken on a long-term basis to support its oil exploration activities after daily rentals crashed due to a plunge in crude prices. However, those were small and old vessels which cannot be compared with the sheer scale of the Make in India project, intended to promote local manufacturing.Initially, even GAIL was not willing to get three of the nine LNG ships built in India, but had to change course following a directive from the ministry of petroleum and natural gas.Similarly, fleet owners were extremely reluctant to build these tankers in India due to concerns over construction time line, quality issues and risks associated with running such ships. Again, they had to relent after the government clearly indicated that it was going to use its LNG buying clout to get local yards to enter the highly lucrative LNG shipbuilding business.The LNG cargo purchasing power has been used by other nations such as South Korea and China to promote and augment their local shipping fleet or to build ships locally.Much has happened since the plan was unveiled. Indias state-owned Cochin Shipyard Ltd has managed to get a technology tie-up with South Koreas Samsung Heavy Industries Co. Ltd to build the LNG carriers. It has also secured a licence from French firm GTT to use its patented Mark-III LNG containment systems.It is imperative for both the government/GAIL and the bidders to meet half way to make this a reality. There should be give and takes in such an exercise; thats how plans such as Make in India can work.It would be childish on the part of global fleet owners to assume that Indian-built LNG ships may lack quality and run into operational problems, resulting in financial implications for them.After all, even the Japanese and the South Koreans, who are reputed LNG shipbuilders in the world today, got started at some point. There is always a first time.Having said that, the government and GAIL should not let go of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to start building LNG ships locally for want of a final push in the last lap of the tendering process.There are many upsides to this, one among them being the huge employment it can generate, which is also a political plank of the government.The government needs to guard against those trying to derail the process. The stakes are high for India. It is now or never.P. Manoj looks at trends in the shipping industry.",2016-10-07,6OWdgnJENnnaqIitbGQXpO,The government and GAIL should not let go of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to start building LNG ships locally for want of a final push in the last lap of the tendering process,both,01:14,LNG shipbuilding: its now or never

-0.16,"Hong Kong/San Francisco: In Chinas internet warzone, theres a road map for success: find a rich backer, get lots of money, burn it to buy market share.
				   
				The latest chapter of that playbook is being written by two young entrepreneurs each offering an update on a former icon of Chinas communist partythe bicycle.In one corner is Dai Wei, 25, whose Beijing Bikelock Technology Co. cycle-sharing startup, known as Ofo, won about $100 million backing in September from investors including the venture fund backed by Xiaomi Corp. founder Lei Jun and Didi Chuxing, the ride-hailing giant that just beat Uber Technologies Inc. out of China. The funding is said to have valued the start-up at $500 million.In the other is Hu Weiwei, who received similar funding days later for her Beijing Mobike Technology Co. from a group including Tencent Holdings Ltd., the nations biggest internet company and, ironically, a long-term backer of Didi.This is the trial by fire of Chinas internet landscape, where alliances change in days and start-ups bleed billions of dollars offering freebies to get customers, only to merge months later so they can take on the next upcoming competitor.Tencent and Didi each picking a different winner makes the competition much more unpredictable and interesting, said Cao Yang, Beijing-based analyst at internet consultant IResearch. It really comes down to which founder can adapt faster and leverage resources better.Bike-sharing is hardly new. There are about 600 such operations globally, with a market that could grow by 20% a year to generate as much as $5.8 billion in revenue by 2020, according to consultancy Roland Berger.Most, like Pariss Velib or Londons so-called Boris Bikes are run or set up by the local government, often with corporate sponsors, and bikes are available from racks at set locations. What differentiates Ofo and Mobike is that users find and pay for bicycles via a smartphone app and then leave the vehicle wherever they want.Each company is targeting a different market. Mobike has gone for high-end branding with bikes that cost as much as 3,000 yuan ($440) to build and have snazzy orange wheels, solid-core tires and satellite navigation. Ofo is targeting students with bright yellow two-wheelers costing only about 250 yuan that dont have GPS and rent for just 1 yuan per hour, typically half that of Mobike. Beijings public bikes are free for the first hour and then 1 yuan per subsequent hour.Mobike locates its vehicles via an integrated GPS. Ofo so-named because the word looks like a bicycledoes so by tracking the smartphones of its riders and sending a code to unlock the bike.These guys all think they can be Amazon, hoping to burn money first and then make money later, said Rawen Huang, Hong Kong-based founder of Petrel Capital, which invests in Chinas internet space. Will we look back in five years time and say Oh my, I cant believe they got funding at that valuation? Probably.In the capitals electronics heartland of Zhongguancun, where high-tech heavyweights like Lenovo Group Ltd. rub shoulders with startups and malls crammed with gadgets, two of Ofos yellow bikes stand in the hallway outside an apartment, which Dai has converted to a makeshift office.In the early stages of a company, expanding is more important than defending, says Dai, echoing the insights imparted by his mentor Cheng Wei, founder of Didi. The faster you use your money, the more efficient, the more money you raise, the stronger you become. Then you control the market.Its a strategy that helped Didi beat off more than 30 rivals. At the height of its battle with Uber, both companies were burning through $1 billion a year, mostly to subsidize fares. Didi now handles more than 11 million rides a day across about 400 cities. While Didi has yet to become profitable, Dai said Ofo is already making money.Bespectacled and soft spoken, Dai gained the support of Didis early investors Wang Gang and GSR Ventures Allen Zhu. The Peking University Ph.D dropout founded Ofo with four other students, ditching their original project on cycling tourism to focus on bike-sharing.Wang was instrumental in helping Ofo find a big tree to lean on, securing not only financial backing from Didi, but also potential access to its 300 million users.A 30-minute bike ride away, in a technology incubator called 768 Creativity Shejiyuan, Hu Weiwei landed an even more powerful ally. Tencents WeChat instant messaging app has more than 800 million users and already integrates things like Didis car-hailing service and JD.com Inc.s shopping function.The 34-year-old former journalist said the two companies are starting to coordinate on certain technology aspects.In a second-floor office down a dark passageway, next to a communal toilet, Hu speaks in a low octave, punctuating her key message: The fact that Tencent is investing in us shows that we share the same philosophy about products and technology.The investment from Tencent, along with Hillhouse Capital and Sequoia Capital, couldnt have been more timely. Following Didis announcement it would back Ofo, users like Shanghai-based Mike Huang began unsubscribing from Mobike to get back their 299 yuan deposits on concern the company would shut down.It just shows you how important the big companies are for the survival of start-ups in China, said Huang, an entrepreneur who has a womens health app. He resubscribed after hearing about the Tencent investment. Chinese internet companies are still in that phase of burning cash to win market share and the brutality of competition is even worse than Silicon Valley.Ofo and Mobike will need more than discounts to win users, they need bikes.Mobike said it has about 30,000 bicycles spread across the major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, which have an estimated combined urban population of more than 74 million.

-1.0,"Bengaluru: A little over two decades back, K.R.Sridhar worked on a NASA mission to convert Martian atmospheric gases to oxygen for propulsion and life support. His work was so ahead of its time that Fortune magazine called him one of the top five futurists inventing tomorrow, today.
				   
				Fast forward to 2016, and the Indian-born rocket scientist-turned-entrepreneur is on a completely different mission: to provide clean, reliable energy for all on Earth.Sridhar, who founded Silicon Valley-based Bloom Energy that makes electricity from (solid oxide) fuel cells using natural gas, has finally brought the technology to India.In an interview with Mint, he talked about how it all started, the efficiency of green technology, why India needs it now more than ever and how it will navigate a few challenges unique to Asias third-largest economy. Edited excerpts:How did Bloom Energy come about?I started out trying to figure out how to create oxygen on Mars, and then along the way, to create water, breathing air, electricity and all those things so that you can think of a sustainable habitat. So I was working on that, but clearly American interest in space exploration started waning after the Cold War because we had other interests and other places to spend our money on. So I realized that seeing a human mission to Mars is not going to happen within the time frame, maybe not in my lifetime. So I started thinking of what I could do that could be impactful. I realized that water and energy are the biggest issues we are going to face in the next 100 years, given that we will get to 10 billion people on the planet. I also knew that if I had cleaner electricity, I could always provide clean water.What do you want to accomplish in India?India is a perfect place for us to prove our basic value proposition: which is you need to decentralize before you distribute it. India has proven that more than any other countryboth in computing and in telecom. If you think about supply of electricity and given when it is available, the extremely bad quality of that supply and the extreme environmental impact of that supply, we can take a page from computing and apply it to power and create distributed, sustainable power all over the country. It can become the model for the rest of the world to follow.Is it hard to sell your technology in a country like India?It is harder and easier. Its harder because until now the gas infrastructure did not exist and there wasnt a company like GAIL telling people, you buy this and we will provide the infrastructure for you and we will provide a reliable supply of gas for you. So it was hard. It is easier because in a place like the US, while they are hurling towards technology and are not afraid of new technology, the grid was fairly adequate and there was enough access to power and there wasnt a demand-supply mismatch. Whereas here, you are offering people power against not having power. So, its easier from that perspective. So it is both.There are many who think that a decentralised (generation and distribution) model will not work for gas-based technologies in India, but only in markets similar to the US. What are your thoughts?Natural gas will be the most abundantly available fuel in the 21st century for electric power generation around the world. This abundance will result in increasingly improved economics and an expanded global export market. Add the fact that natural gas is the lowest carbon fossil fuel and you have a very attractive fuel for power generation. This is the significance of our partnership with GAIL which is committed to expanding the natural gas infrastructure for decentralized power generation in India. With this, we believe that decentralised gas-fuelled power generation has a bright future in India and will help this country make the same kind of technology leapfrog in power generation from centralized to distributed that we have seen in telephonythe country avoided the fixed infrastructure investments of landline telephones and went straight to mobile.Your tariffs are still considerably above other alternate sources of power.The important question is what you are providing. Do they find the value in what you are doing. You may have a (cheaper) solar power plan, but with a solar panel on your roof, if you cannot turn on the lights in the night, when the sun is not shining, that power is not of much use to you. It doesnt matter what it costs.You may get a (cheaper) coal power plan because of which your child can study because the lights are on, but if that childs life is going to be reduced by 10 years because of all the pollution it puts up, you are going to wonder if that is the best alternative.A household may think, cheap power is good enough, why do I need more. The average life of all their appliances in their house is going down so fast because of problems with voltage and stability. They are never able to calculate the cost associated with that. They sometimes dont realize that they are paying significantly more for a refrigerator because the company had to build all these additional band-aids for that power, to make sure the warranty problem doesnt come to them and charge them more. It is about total overall value, as opposed to the essential value of commodities. That is an education that we have to do.We absolutely know that we have a learning curve and a cost curve. We are confident that over a few years with scale, people will use us not just because of all the positive attributes we bring, but also be cause we are the most affordable.How do you plan to procure biogas? Though GAIL has promised you natural gas, you will need more supply. So think of this1.3, fast forward 1.4 billion people in the nationthe amount of human waste, the amount of animal waste that comes from supporting this, the amount of plant waste that comes from supporting the animals and the plants is gigantic and it is either a liability or can be converted into an asset. And to us, it should be an asset and that becomes the biogas fuel. In the past, it was always a problem because the power plants were very, very large and you needed to go long distances to collect the biomass, bringing it to a huge centralized base and the cost of carrying it over a long distance was incredible.But, in the distributed Bloom model, people can take their own bio-waste and put that into their own bio-mass plant, generate their own biogas and produce their own power. And, in a true Gandhian way, can have a completely sustained solution.Are you happy with GAILs infrastructure in Bengaluru (where Bloom is powering technology company Intels R&D lab)?I dont think GAIL will say they are happy with it because they are aggressively trying to get into Bangalore, and as you know, in any big city like Bangalore, there are issues of being able to lay a pipeline quickly and all that. However, what I am extremely impressed with is the aggressive speed and passion with which they want to get it done, in spite of obstacles.What incentives are you offering to get more companies to sign up?You do that when you dont believe in your product. Our product more than speaks for itself. We are satisfying an unmet need. Those corporate customers have a root canal. I am offering them a pain killer. I dont need to discount it.But, if you look at the US, places where it worked were states where there were incentives or subsidies. Isnt it?True, there are different ways to look at it. If it were a level-playing field, we would require more subsidies. Because everyone else is subsidized. Not giving a subsidy to us puts us on an uneven playing field. That is the reason we need subsidies in the US.Could you eventually think of powering individual homes too?It may not be the best thing because if you think of individual homes, the evenings and mornings, when you do all these things, that (is when) you may be consuming power. It may be capital inefficient for you to have a piece of equipment that is not working for you all the time. It will better for a cluster of homes and businesses to be in a little micro-grid. I think thats a better solution than having a little box in every home.Where exactly will your fuel cell packs be installed?It should be right where you use it and where its under your control. Typically, you never did that because these power generators were noisy, they vibrated and so you liked to put it far awayout of sight, out of mind. Here is a beautiful looking piece of equipment, children can play around it, people can have a picnic table around it. You can put it on a rooftop, on a basement or next to a parking lot. For the same amount of energy that you can produce, we require 120 times less land. So, (while) land use is a big issue usually (with respect to  power generation), this is a non-issue for us.When are you going public?Going public is just a step of a long process for a company. It is not even the beginning to the end, its just one small step. When we are ready, we will do it. We are definitely closer to it than we were.People can think what they want. It is a private company and our stakeholdersour investors, customers and employeesare all happy with the path we have taken.Are you profitable?We can state with no uncertainty that if we dont find a path to make our own company sustainable, we cannot make the planet sustainable. We have a path for sustainability, both for us and our planet. Being a private company we dont discuss these things.Can you tell me about your energy capacity? Where do you see it in five years?We are very actively engaged in building a pipeline for customers. We have actively started engaging with prospective customers. Obviously in the regions where natural gas is available like Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad. Places like that where there is both an availability of natural gas and a supply-demand mismatch, where electricity is a problem. Hopefully, next year, when you see me, the numbers will be impressive.Could you possibly look at local manufacturing of fuel cells to bring costs down?We already manufacture some component systems in India and make use of supply chain partners which also contribute Make in India manufactured goods which are incorporated into our systems. As the market develops in India and volume justifies it, we expect more Make in India content in our systems.Will Bloom Energy seek to source biogas from local plants for generation of electricity if enough natural gas is not available?This is among the options we are considering, especially in more rural areas.How do you plan to raise funds?As a private company, we dont discuss our funding requirements. We are a very healthy company, well-positioned to execute our business plan.Costs associated with building and maintaining fuel cells are pretty high. How can you change that?We are already economically attractive for certain types of customersthose commercial or government entities that have significant business critical operations that cannot suffer interruption of power. Like any new, transformative technology, Blooms technology is riding a steep cost-down path as innovation and market volume forces come together to bring down cost. We are extremely confident that this trend will continue for many years.How do you rate India companies when it comes to sustainability initiatives?We applaud that sustainability is an increasing focus for India Inc. Much is left to be done and the challenge is significant to improving the sustainability of business operations in India and for the society.What are the three biggest problems with Indias power infrastructure?We see the three biggest challenges as lack of access and adequate supply of electric power to fully support the society, challenges with power reliability and power outages, and still high CO2, high nox (oxides of Nitrogen), sox (oxides of sulphur) and particulate emissions relative to what is possible today with an advanced technology such as Bloom.Whats your advice to young entrepreneurs?Pick something you are passionate (about), because there are so many ups and downs. To be able to still go ahead, that passion needs to be strong. It should be yours and not someone elses.(Theres) nothing wrong in being a capitalist, nothing wrong in wanting to make money. But money is a lot more satisfying, if you also find something that has a social impact.Gireesh Chandra Prasad in New Delhi contributed to this story",2016-10-17,6p08znifFPuASBf1TXMe6I,"KR Sridhar talks about the efficiency of green technology, why India needs it and how Bloom Energy will navigate through challenges unique to the country",both,01:17,Decentralized gas-fuelled power generation has a bright future: Bloom Energy CEO
-0.22,"Mumbai: State-owned fuel retailers are planning to approach the government to compensate them for their losses while giving a 0.75% discount for cashless payments, two people aware of the matter said.
				   
				In the wake of demonetisation, the government on 8 December announced a discount of 0.75% for purchase of auto fuel using credit and debit cards and e-wallets at fuel stations run by Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corp.  Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd. The  discount came into effect on 13 December 2016. We may reach out to the government seeking compensation on the revenue losses arising out of the 0.75% discount we are currently providing. We plan to approach the government in a few months, said the first of the two officials cited above, an executive from one of the oil marketing companies, on condition of anonymity. A Mint report last month quoted OMCs as saying that the discounts could dent the revenue by around Rs1,100 crore till March. If the discount period is extended by another  quarter, it would double. The OMCs said they do not want the discount period extended. While marketing business (which includes fuel retailing) forms 18% of volumes for IOCL, at BPCL and HPCL, it forms 40-50%. Religare Institutional Research in a report dated 9 December said, Assuming 70% of transactions at OMC outlets go digital, IOCL, BPCL and HPCL could see a worst-case earnings hit of 8-14% in FY18 if they are unable to pass on these costs (which is unlikely). There are additional benefits of improved transparency and efficiency.The OMCs did not reply to an email sent on Thursday morning.I think the discount helps our marketing strategy. It will bring more customers to us who can experience our services, if they already have not. We will have to see if the government agrees to compensate us for the losses, said the second official, another OMC executive, on condition of anonymity. For OMCs,  diesel forms 70% of sales.  Assuming 70% of all transactions at fuel outlets move to the digital medium, the net discount for petrol/diesel works out to Rs0.3/litre. This can be comfortably passed on, as OMCs have been able to raise gross marketing margins in these products from Rs1 per litre to Rs2.6 per litre over the last three years, added Religare Institutional Research in its report. The OMCs operate (owned and co-owned with dealers) a network of 52,000 retail outlets, with annual sales of 92 billion litres of diesel and 31 billion litres of petrol (FY17E). OMCs said on Thursday that post-demonetisation, they have seen e-transactions go up by 50% in cities and around 30% in semi-rural areas. However, many rural areas are yet to start with digital payments. OMCs said many rural outlets do not have the means to accept digital payments. Once that is facilitated, the number of transactions would go up.Kotak Securities in a report dated 27 December said, IOCL management indicated that it has not received any clarification from the government on compensation for discounts on fuel sales through digital means. However, the company will be able to recover the incidental loss through reduction in transaction costs and modestly higher marketing margins on overall sales, if not compensated adequately. OMCs expect that once people get used to the e-transactions, the discounts would cease.",2017-01-20,6u1ZK0NzOfqJ9BwYwQWWoL,State-owned firms aim to approach government in a few months over the 0.75% discount for cashless payments at fuel outlets,both,01:13,Cashless discounts: Fuel retailers may ask govt for compensation

-0.58,"New Delhi: As an organization, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is changing the way payments are made in the countryfrom launching a card payment settlement system that competes with Visa and MasterCard to setting up a platform to facilitate instant money transfer. 
				   
				The Reserve Bank of India-backed organization is preparing to launch the second version of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) called UPI 2.0 by early next year and is betting that the upgraded version will accelerate Indias movement towards a cashless economy. In an email interview, NPCI managing director and chief executive A.P. Hota spoke about the progress made and challenges encountered by UPI so far, and the latest milestones that have been set for the payment system. Edited excerpts:Since its launch, how many banks have taken to UPI technology?Twenty banks have launched UPI. Mobile apps of 17 banks are available on the Google play store.In the last one month, what are the challenges that have emerged with respect to UPI?The main challenge is awareness. Though media has played a splendid role, for making the customer to actually download the app and make use of the same, its required that the value proposition of the technology needs to be clearly explained.But we know that unlike social media apps, adoption of electronic payments would be slow.How much time does it take for any financial product to integrate UPI?It takes time. The simplest form of mobile payment is person-to-person payments. Merchant payment is complex and requires integration with banks as well as merchants payment system. Card payment is simple because the process is the same all over the world. Mobile payment processes are relatively new.Currently, how many UPI transactions have started to take place?On a daily basis, about 4,000 transactions are taking place from about 300,000 customers who have downloaded a UPI-based bank app.So, apart from the banks, how many other entities such as a payment gateway, have adopted UPI?Not many have, but we expect about 50 such merchants by the end of October integrated with UPI. In the next one year, what are the targets for UPIin terms of bank adoption, consumer traction and usage of UPI by other payment products?We expect 50 banks, 15 million customers, 100 merchants and around one million transactions as a peak day volume by March 2017.What is the strategy being used to counter the awareness challenge you earlier mentioned and to reach the targets mentioned above?Once we reach about 30 banks including State Bank of India and HDFC Bank, we will start an awareness campaign. We will also add new use cases of UPI technology such as merchant payments and bill payments. We have also planned a UPI version 2.0 for March 2017.What are some of the features that UPI 2.0 will have?UPI 2.0 will have enhanced features based on the feedback received from banks. For instance, specialized payments such as bill payments, insurance premium, EMI (equated monthly instalment) collection, etc. would be made very simple by seamless integration with BBPS (Bharat Bill Payments System).",2016-10-12,7L6ln4U6lTBzrNlRlM546M,"A.P.

0.63,"Mumbai: The central bank is working on setting up a financial sector resolution corporation, said N.S. Vishwanathan, deputy governor, Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
				   
				We have discussed with the government the shape this corporation will take. Its purpose is to not only provide insurance to financial companies but also to provide resolution, Vishwanathan said at the Mint Annual Banking Conclave.The deputy governor said that while non-financial sector companies had the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to deal with resolution, the proposed corporation is likely to help protect financial sector companies.In September 2016, a panel set up by the government had released a draft law on financial sector resolution. This draft had suggested setting up a corporation to manage resolution. And it had also said that once the Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill, 2016 was enacted, the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) could be dissolved and all its functions passed on to the new corporation.Vishwanathan pointed out that the regulator had already put in place measures to de-risk bank balance sheets by reducing excessive exposure to large corporate accounts.We are also using this to develop the capital market. Banks will have to find different ways of using their funds, he said.In December 2016, RBI said that it would cap banks exposure to a group of connected companies at 25% of the lenders core capital, seeking to reduce concentration risk in a banking industry laden with bad loans.The central bank lowered the limit from 40% of the banks total capital funds, which include both Tier 1 (core) and Tier 2 capital, and gave banks until 2019 to meet the new norms.In the case of an individual company, this limit would be changed to 20% of Tier 1 capital, compared with 15% of total capital funds currently, RBI had said.The deputy governor said that while stressed loans were something that the banking sector was grappling with, the setting up of the Central Repository for Information on Large Credit (CRILC) was helping them gather more information and take better calls while resolving stress.RBI is also looking at the financial technology space and assessing the impact that it could have on various kinds of financial services.We need to make exploratory efforts on what needs to be regulated, how it will be regulated in a way that innovation is not undermined, Vishwanathan said.We have a multi-regulatory working group that we have put in place to look at the entire gamut of issues that are affecting the industry and hopefully will get their report soon, he added.",2017-01-23,7MPtvBBSDuHfH4czTZfcdL,"RBI deputy governor N.S.

Net sales improved 6.7% y-o-y to Rs1,307 crore. Both net profit and net sales exceeded Bloomberg estimates of Rs58.09 crore and Rs1,145.60 crore, respectively. 
				   
				Volumes grew more than 10% y-o-y, but realizations slipped. Also, the quarters Ebitda at Rs2,244 crore was marginally below estimates of some analysts. This miss was primarily due to increase in minimum wages, which resulted in a sequential rise in employee cost/tonne. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.While the stock has lost 2.2% after the September quarter earnings were announced, i.e. in the last three trading sessions, the anticipated short-term negative impact of currency ban has led to correction of 26.4% since 9 November.In a post-earnings conference call, the management said demonetization of Rs500/1,000 notes has not affected sales volume till date and the proportion of cash in cement purchase is only 10-15%. But some brokerage firms have raised a red flag by trimming their Ebitda estimates. Our channel checks indicate pressure on demand in most parts of the country. We expect dispatches to get impacted going ahead. We revise our Ebitda estimates downwards by 3.3%/13.8% for FY17E/FY18E to factor in lower demand in H2FY17 due to the demonetization issue, Emkay Research said in a report. Sharing a similar view, Reliance Securities Ltd too has cut Ebitda estimates by 6% and 15% for FY17E and FY18E, respectively. Meanwhile, in the first half of this fiscal year, India Cements has repaid Rs80 crore debt and aims at debt repayment of Rs170 crore in the second half. The management expects debt refinancing to reduce interest costs by 75 basis points. A basis point is 0.01%.Apart from that, the company would incur Rs200 crore towards maintenance capex in FY17 and another Rs400 crore towards replacement of mills and maintenance capex.Shares of India Cements are currently trading at a one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple of 15.21, lower than peers.

-0.47,"Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) reported another set of sub-par results, with revenues and operating profit for the quarter ended 30 September declining by more than 4% sequentially in its India operations. The company doesnt report results for its wireless business separately anymore, and the India business is therefore the best proxy for it. 
				   
				Earlier, Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd had reported sequential revenue declines of around 2%, largely due to the seasonality factor. RCom said in a press statement that results for the quarter were impacted by an increase in competitive intensity, migration of CDMA customers to 4G LTE and seasonality factors. Its understandable that the migration attempt will result in some disruption. Average revenue per user rose 5% sequentially, suggesting a larger proportion of low-value customers have been lost. But overall, given the continued sluggishness, theres hardly anything for investors to get excited about. RCom shares have more than halved in the current year, and initial enthusiasm about the companys strategic deals with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd as well as its deleveraging plans has waned.All of the debt-reduction plans the company has talked about are still a work-in-progress and some of them are at fairly preliminary stages. And while the merger of its wireless business with Aircel Ltd may come through, the success of the deal depends largely on how successful the two are in raising a large amount of equity capital in the combined entity. And the current environment, where telecom stocks have fallen at a fast pace, is hardly conducive for raising equity. There is also lack of clarity about RComs arrangements with Reliance Jio for use of the latters 4G network, and how beneficial the deal will be. A look at how the companys shares have moved this year suggests investors are not very hopeful about RComs prospects.Reliance Group companies have sued HT Media Ltd, Mints publisher, and nine others in the Bombay high court over a 2 October 2014 front-page story that they have disputed.

This time last year, TCS shares enjoyed a 15% higher valuation than Infosys, based on analysts expectations of future earnings. By this week, that had turned into a small discount.Then on Thursday, TCS beat revenue and profit estimates for the June quarter, but operating margins shrank to 25%. Thats below the managements targeted range of 26% to 28%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Infosys, which reported on Friday, cut its sales forecast for the year. Worse still, its operating margin came in at just 24.1%, extending a nearly four-year decline in relative profitability for the Bangalore-based group.Two years ago, Infosys tapped SAP executive Vishal Sikka to take over from the founders, who all seemed bent on having a go at running the company before retirement. For a while, it looked like they might run it aground. But while Infosys has steadied under Sikka, its increasingly clear that the new normal for operating margins for both Infosys and TCS may be around 25%, and not the 29% to 31% that at least Infosys used to hit fairly regularly before its management merry-go-around left it dizzy.Profitability is now capped by robots, or, to be more specific, a combination of artificial intelligence, digital technologies, blockchain and other innovations that are challenging the traditional strategy of throwing people at complex software problems and charging clients for their time. But while the large Indian vendors are themselves investing in these new areas, so much of their legacy business depends on exploiting the price difference between techies in the West and in developing countries, its not clear if theyll be able to switch to a people-lite business model in time.For the top four Indian vendors, growth in total employment has slowed to 8% levels, from 106% in the year ended in March 2012. But nimbler challengers are threatening to nibble at juicy businesses faster than the Indian companies can slim down. For instance, UK-based start-up Thought Machine has created a new, blockchain-based core banking package that resides in the cloud and wont require expensive in-house data centers, according to a report this week in Artificial Intelligence Online. TCS has made two acquisitions of more than $500 million in value, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. The last was in 2014. Infosys hasnt done any of that size with its $5 billion in cash. TCS fell as much as 3.8% in Mumbai on Friday, while Infosys slumped almost 11%. The relative performance of the two is no longer much of an investment theme. Of far greater importance is how they take on those robots. Bloomberg

				The company was granted a formal licence on 14 October. BP granted licence to market Motor Spirit (petrol) and High Speed Diesel (diesel)another milestone for BP in India, the company tweeted. The UK-based firm, as also Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd, was given approval by the oil ministry to retail petrol and diesel, officials said. A significant step in #BPs partnership with Indiabeen granted licence to market Motor Spirit and High Speed Diesel, it said. A BP India spokesperson had earlier this month stated that: BP sees a strong future for transportation fuels in India. We are keen to be involved in this market and contribute to its development. The company had in January this year won in-principle approval to retail aviation turbine fuel (ATF) to airlines in India. Subsequently, it got full approval for that. We can confirm we have been granted approval for marketing for ATF, the BP spokesperson said. For a licence to retail auto fuelspetrol, diesel and ATF, a company should have invested a minimum of Rs2,000 crore in exploration or production of oil and gas, oil refining, gas or product pipeline or terminals leading to additionally to the existing assets or creation of new assets in the eligible activities. BP, which had in 2011 bought 30% interest in 21 exploration blocks of Reliance Industries for $7.2 billion, had cited investment of nearly $500 million in oil and gas exploration and production for gaining the licence. India currently has about 56,190 petrol pumps, with public sector firms operating a majority of them. Private sector operators are limited to Essar Oil and Reliance Industries, who between them have some 3,500 petrol pumps. Royal Dutch Shell operates 82 petrol stations. Numaligarh Refineries Ltd (NRL) and Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) are late entrants and have six outlets between them. State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) owns 25,363 petrol pumps, Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) 13,802 stations and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) 13,439 outlets. Kolkata-based Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd (HPL) was the latest company to get licence to set up upto 100 petrol pumps, mostly in West Bengal. In ATF or jet fuel retailing, there are 205 aviation fuel stations, 100 of which are owned by IOC, 40 by BPCL and 37 by HPCL.

-0.28,"Sometimes it is better to chop off a decaying limb of a company, especially when it starts to infect its more profitable businesses. Avantha Group-owned capital goods firm Crompton Greaves Ltd (CG) has done precisely this. On Wednesday, it inked an agreement for the sale of its international power business for 115 million (around Rs.850 crore) to a US-based private equity fund which is likely to be completed in the next six months.
				   
				This brings a ray of hope for  investors in the beleaguered firm. For 17 long quarters, CGs international operations, which comprised about half the consolidated business, have incurred losses. Worse, total borrowing continued to rise, while the international businessbuilt through acquisitionsfailed to churn out cash. Over a period, the losses from the overseas operations pulled down the companys overall performance too.For the December 2015 quarter, CG posted a net loss of Rs.107 crore, from a sizeable profit in the year-ago period. Not surprisingly, the Street reacted adversely to the results and the stock, which was outperforming the benchmark indices earlier, fell 30% in 10 days.Against this backdrop, investors welcomed the news of the sale. The CG stock rose by about 9% on Wednesday, after it was known that the proceeds will straightaway pare debt of Rs.900 crore. The stock fell 0.63% on Thursday.It does not matter that there will be no cash inflows to CG. Whats important is that the ailing businessesspread over the US, France, Ireland, Hungary, Belgium and Indonesiaare finally out of the companys turf.That said, some of the power businesses will remain part of the Indian operations. But with this deal, CGs travails will be over. The stand-alone business, apart from being profitable, is debt-free. What remains to be recouped is traction in domestic revenues. A report by JM Financial Services Ltd points out that the firms industrials business has been working at a low 50% utilization due to dearth of orders. Recovery depends on industrial and railway capex, both of which are some time away.For now, the business, which weighed down valuations (analysts had given the international business a negative valuation), is off CGs back.

-0.69,"Jakarta: Indonesia will exceed its coal production target for another year as miners cash in after prices recovered from a five-year collapse.
				   
				The worlds biggest exporter will produce about 489 million metric tonnes this year, 18% above the government-mandated target, according to energy ministry forecasts. Thats up from last years output estimated at 434 million tonnes and would be at least the third year in a row that the nation has produced more than it planned.Southeast Asias largest economy has been trying to cap its coal output in an attempt to preserve resources for future generations of Indonesians. Thats proving a challenge as resurgent prices tempt producers to maximize output from new and existing mines to meet demand at home and abroad.Actual annual production will generally be higher than targeted because prices are now higher, Bambang Gatot Ariyono, the director general of coal and mineral resources at the energy and mineral resources ministry, said Jan. 5. It compensates for previous losses.Coal more than doubled in 2016 after tumbling to the lowest in almost a decade as efforts by China to reduce excess supply pushed prices higher and faster than anyone anticipated. The recovery is breathing new life into an industry hammered by overcapacity and shrinking demand, reviving share prices of miners around the world, from Indonesias PT Bumi Resources to Australias Whitehaven Coal Ltd.A gauge of Indonesian mining companies surged more than 70% in 2016, dwarfing the 15% advance in the Jakarta Composite index. The gauge slumped 41% in 2015, its worst year since 2008.Production outlookBumi Resources, Indonesias biggest coal producer, expects to mine more than 90 million tonnes this year, compared with 86 million tonnes in 2016, corporate secretary Dileep Srivastava said in an e-mail. PT Adaro Energy, operator of the countrys largest mine, didnt provide estimates for 2017 but the company said in e-mail that it will continue to maintain production discipline and improve efficiency to grow the company sustainably in the long term.The government isnt willing to force companies to curtail output from newly constructed mines after granting them production licenses, according Ariyono from the energy ministry. We cant tell them to stop, he said.A growing share of Indonesias output is remaining in the country, with 25% of supply this year forecast to be consumed domestically, up from 21% in 2016 and 19 percent in 2015, according to energy ministry estimates. The government sees local demand at 121 million tons this year, up from an estimated 91 million tonnes in 2016, according to the data.Still, Indonesia exports most of what it mines, with China, India, South Korea, and Japan among its biggest customers. With international prices now showing signs of peaking, Indonesia isnt being complacent about the longevity of the rally, according to the countrys coal mining association.China balanceProducers view that current high prices cant be used as future reference, said Hendra Sinadia, deputy executive director of the Indonesian Coal Mining Association.Thermal coal in Indonesia climbed for a seventh month to $101.69 a metric ton in December, the highest since 2012 and the longest run of gains in data compiled by Bloomberg since 2009. Australias Newcastle coal more than doubled last year to almost $110 a ton in November, before slipping to about $84 this month.China, which produces and consumes more than any other country on the planet, has worked overtime to cool the market, reversing some output restrictions and encouraging more production before winter. The nations output rose in November to the highest level in a year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.China will re-balance between cutting production and meeting domestic demand, Sinadia said. They are doing this right now.Indonesias miners are also trying to wean themselves off China, with exports shrinking over the past three years. The nation accounted for almost 20 percent of Indonesias total overseas shipments in 2015, down from almost 31% in 2013, according to data from the state statistics agency. Over the same period, Indias coal purchases rose to 34 percent of Indonesias exports, from 28% in 2013, the data show.Diversified exposureWhen Bumi realized that China growth was showing signs of a slow down three to four years ago we proactively diversified into other markets such as India and developed a few new ones like Philippines, Bumi Resourcess Srivastava said. We prefer not to be overly exposed in any single market but to have a diversified market exposure.Indonesias exports to China may fall again in 2017 as rising domestic output erodes its appetite for imports, according to Michelle Leung, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.Exports will depend on the level of demand in the seaborne market, said Rory Simington, principal coal analyst at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. Indonesian producers have the flexibility to satisfy demand from China, India and rest of the seaborne market, provided the price is right. Bloomberg",2017-01-13,80hfIfrBjfXapHk7es4JsK,Southeast Asias largest economy has been trying to cap its coal output in an attempt to preserve resources for future generations of Indonesians,competitor,09:37,"Coals recovery too good to resist for Indonesia, the worlds biggest exporter"
0.26,"The Cabinet has approved the spectrum auction plan recommended by the department of telecommunication. The value of the spectrum that is being put up for the auction is more than Rs.5 trillion, based on the proposed reserve price. Hardly anyone expects telecom companies to bid for the entire spectrum; although based on past experience, with Indian telecom firms, you can never say never.
				   
				About three-fourths of the total spectrum on offer, in value terms, is in the 700 megahertz (MHz) band. Telecom firms such as Bharti Airtel Ltd have said that the pricing makes it unaffordable. Also, if the government has managed to make contiguous blocks of 1800MHz spectrum available in the auction, the demand for spectrum in the 700MHz band will naturally be low.Most importantly, the sectors debt is already at monumental levels and based on leverage metrics such as debt/Ebitda, there is hardly any leeway in terms of taking on much additional debt. As such, the Rs.4 trillion worth 700MHz spectrum should ideally be left untouched.Even so, some telecom firms may still explore bidding in a few circlessuch as B and C circles where pricing of this spectrum is not as expensive vis-à-vis other bands. If bidding is restricted to these circles, investors will be largely unconcerned. But if extends to other circles, and telecom firms get bold as they have in some previous auctions, investors have much to worry.As pointed earlier in this column, the governments approach leaves much to be desired. It seems to be least bothered about the financial health of the industry, and is treating it as a golden goose.Of course, the government cant be entirely blamed when telcos themselves have been reckless while bidding in past auctions. According to analysts, this is one of the reasons telecom stocks have underperformed in recent months. The upcoming mega auction is making some investors nervous. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients earlier this year, Even as Bharti India CEO, in the 3QFY16 earnings concall, repeatedly termed the Trais (Telecom Regulatory Authority of Indias) proposed 700MHz spectrum reserve prices unaffordable, we hope we do not end up with a treatise titled Art of buying the unaffordable, volume 3 sometime post the proposed auctions.",2016-06-22,8KBlcj1fZmd8pP2JFG8HcI,"The sectors debt is at monumental levels, but the government seems to be least bothered about its financial health and is treating it as a golden goose

-0.29,"New York: AT&T is reportedly on the verge of announcing yet another massive merger, this time with $71 billion Time Warner. The goal here sort of makes sense: AT&T has the distribution network and it wants the content of Time Warner, parent of HBO, CNN and TBS.
				   
				But should AT&T follow through with a Time Warner purchase, its debt may balloon to levels that would put it at risk of a downgrade. Thats a significant concern for both AT&T, the second-largest US wireless carrier, and the broader $8 trillion corporate-bond market, considering that this company already has more than $120 billion of debt outstanding.Lets put that debt load into context. Its more than any other non-financial issuer in the US corporate bond market and more than four times as much as the biggest US junk-bond seller.At a minimum, any downgrade would dent the value of AT&Ts debt and send its borrowing costs higher. So what would it take for that to happen? Its current rating is BBB+ at S&P, three levels above junk, after being cut in 2015 in the wake of its $18.2 billion purchase of AWS-3 wireless spectrum licenses. AT&T has said it wants to reduce debt to regain its higher rating, but this deal very well could move it in the opposite direction.Lets say it were to pay all cash for the transaction and a 20% premium to Time Warners current market value, which has already risen amid the takeover speculation. AT&T would have to borrow billions of dollars in additional debt because it currently only has $7.2 billion of cash on its books. Net debt would then potentially surge to more than three times the combined Ebitda that AT&T and Time Warner are forecast to generate next year. That would be enough for a downgrade, according to a recent S&P Global Ratings report.AT&T is already nearing its leverage limits for its current rating at Moodys, so a material increase in debt over Ebitda will put it at risk for a downgrade at that credit-rating company.This is all hypothetical, of course, and if recent reports are correct that an agreement could be reached as soon as this weekend, well learn the actual deal terms soon enough. Bloomberg reported late Friday that AT&T is talking about buying Time Warner for about $110 a share, in a deal structured as half stock, half cash. While that wouldnt boost AT&Ts overall leverage ratio as much as if the carrier used all cash, it will still probably require its incurring more debt. That means the combined company needs to demonstrate its even more profitable than the two separate corporations or else face higher debt-to-income ratios, and a possible downgrade. The potential for this type of disruptive development happening matters greatly at a time when investors are pouring near-record amounts of cash into the US credit market. Just last year, a Moodys downgrade of Sprint, the biggest US junk-bond issuer, sparked a tumble in that wireless carriers debt and sent jitters through the high-yield market, showing how unsettling it can be when a dominant corporate-bond sellers rating is cut. And in Sprints case it was already junk-rated. Were AT&T to lose its investment-grade status, that could trigger more disruption as some bondholders cant hold high-yield debt and would be forced to sell. AT&T still has a fairly long way to fall before it loses its high-grade status, but a massive deal like this needs to be monitored closely by credit investors to make sure that its creating more value than its destroying.Investment-grade corporate bonds are poised for their best annual performance since 2009. Going forward, its idiosyncratic events like this that may drive whether the investments remain winners or turn into losers.

-0.22,"Xiaomi Corp.s international chief Hugo Barra has quit after a turbulent four years during which the Chinese smartphone maker rose to the top of its home market before local rivals mimicked its model and dethroned the brand.
				   
				The former Google executive is returning to Silicon Valley after being hired with much fanfare in 2013 to be Xiaomis global face, becoming a fixture on the conference circuit and the up-and coming vendors main pitchman to foreign audiences. In a Facebook post Monday, Barra said it was time for him to return home to embark on a new adventure, without elaborating. Senior vice-president Xiang Wang will oversee global operations after Barra departs in February, after the Lunar New Year holidays.Barra was given the task of taking Xiaomi global, helping the company make inroads into India, where sales topped $1 billion for the first time in 2016. During his tenure, it briefly became Chinas biggest smartphone vendor by packing high-end components into inexpensive devices and building a vibrant online community of users. But local brands such as Oppo, Vivo and Huawei Technologies Co. rapidly copied its moves and developed more innovative competitive tactics.ALSO READ: Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 camera proves it isnt only about the megapixelsHugo was a key figure for Xiaomi in the early days because he helped overseas marketing, said Kitty Fok, managing director of IDC China. Barras departure is likely to have limited impact because Xiaomis position in India has stabilized and the task has shifted to growing market share, said Fok.His exit may indicate that Xiaomi is re-focusing on its home market, said Nicole Peng, an analyst at Canalys. Barra will be departing Beijinga city infamous for hazardous air pollutionjust as Xiaomi is struggling to find its footing at home. What Ive realized is that the last few years of living in such a singular environment have taken a huge toll on my life and started affecting my health, Barra wrote in his post. Seeing how much Ive left behind these past few years, it is clear to me that the time has come to return.Xiaomi was last valued at $45 billion in 2014, making it one of the worlds largest startups. It drew comparisons to Apple Inc. after doubling revenue that year and climbing to the top of the Chinese smartphone market . Its since struggled, missing its 2015 shipments target and falling behind Oppo and Huawei. The company is aiming for 100 billion yuan ($14.5 billion) in revenue this yearthe same target it had set as far back as 2015.Since that valuation in 2014, analysts have questioned its price tag given a sliding market position. In a memo posted on his WeChat account, billionaire co-founder Lei Jun said his company had tried to grow too rapidly in past years and missed opportunities.Its had more success in India, where it grew shipments 150% last year. Chinese brands account for 51% of Indias smartphone shipments in November, according to Counterpoint Research. Xiaomi is now counting on the country to drive its next phase of growth: it already assembles over three-quarters of its Indian smartphones in the country under the governments Make in India program.Yet despite that success, Xiaomis most important market by far remains its home country, where it may be preparing a comeback.Xiaomi realized the Chinese smartphone market will be their top priority, Peng said. India was the only shining point for Xiaomis overseas expansion over the years, and entering the US market will not be easy because the market is strongly held by Apple and Samsung.Xiaomi secured $1.1 billion in 2014 from investors including GIC Pte., All-Stars Investment Ltd and DST. Executives have since said repeatedly that it isnt on the hunt for financing, while deflecting speculation about an initial public offering. Apart from phones, the company also sells other types of electronic gadgets and appliances, from air purifiers to robot vacuums, made by what it calls its ecosystem-partners. Sales through such manufacturing and branding partners exceeded 15 billion yuan in 2016, Lei has said.As much as we would love to have Hugo stay with us in Beijing for a much longer time, we understand his personal challenges and wish him all the best in his future endeavors, co-founder Lin Bin wrote in a comment on Barras Facebook post.

-0.9,"Ousted Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry was pushing C. Sivasankaran, who had played dealmaker in several Tata group transactions in the past, to pay up the Siva groups share of the DoCoMo award, and also discussed with the board of the holding company possible legal action against the sometimes controversial, Seychelles-based entrepreneur, documents seen by Mint show.
				   
				On 15 September, at his penultimate Tata Sons board meeting as chairman, Mistry raised this issue, the documents show. He was removed as chairman when the board next met on 24 October.Interestingly, on 19 September, Tata Sons (Tata Teleservices Ltd and NTT DoCoMo Inc. are named as co-respondents) received a legal notice from a firm retained by Sivasankarans Sterling Info-tech Ltd, alleging mismanagement of Tata Teleservices and reserving the right to seek damages to recover its (Sterlings) losses.Mint learns that a decision on how to respond to this email had not been taken till Mistrys exit.Tata group spokesperson Debasis Ray said in an email response to Mints queries that in 2008, when Docomo agreed to acquire shares of Tata Teleservices, Tata Sons voluntarily offered other shareholders of TTSL an opportunity for a pro-rata sale of their holdings. This was subject to the shareholders agreeing to bear a pro-rata portion of any claims or amounts payable to Docomo should such an event arise.... Thereafter in 2014, Docomo exercised the put option. In terms of the agreement with the selling shareholders, Tata Sons demanded from Mr Sivasankaran his pro-rata share of the amount payable to Docomo.Ray added that Tata Sons is pursuing all legal options for recovery of this amount.Mint couldnt ascertain whether the company had responded to Sivasankarans notice. Sivasankaran could not be reached for comment immediately.The notice from Sivasankarans law firm mentions his long-standing association with the Tata Group of Companies on account of his close association with Mr Ratan Tata.Sivasankaran has had several dealings with the group, taking Barista, Indias first coffee chain that the Tata group had acquired, off its hands, selling Dishnet DSL to the Tata-owned VSNL, which subsequently became Tata Communications, and facilitating the sale of the Tata stake in the Birla-Tata-AT&T telecom venture to the Aditya Birla Group, resulting in the formation of Idea Cellular Ltd.In early 2006, the Siva group acquired 520 million shares in Tata Teleservices at Rs 17 per share or Rs884 crore. It paid Rs102 crore towards this, the documents show. It paid the balance in February 2006. Of the Rs782 crore, the documents show that Rs650 crore was funded by a loan from Standard Chartered Bank effectively guaranteed by Tata Sons. The balance Rs132 crore came from Kalimati Investments, a subsidiary of Tata Steel.Ray confirmed both and said that to ensure that in the event of a default on the repayment of the loan, the shares of Tata Teleservices were not sold to a third party, Tata Sons agreed to an arrangement whereby the bank would sell the shares to Tata Sons.He added that a part of the consideration was funded by another Tata company for a few days on market-linked terms.In 2006, when the loan was refunded, the Tata group withdrew this guarantee, and the Siva group had to provided other collateral to the bank, the documents show.Then came the 2008 deal with DoCoMo under which the latter bought shares amounting to 26% of Tata Teleservices equity. Of the 26%, 20% was to be fresh equity and 6%, a sale by existing shareholders. Under this, the documents with Mint show, Sivasankaran sold 20.74 million shares at Rs117.81 apiece, turning a tidy profit.The DoCoMo investment eventually turned sour, and with no initial public offering in sight, the Japanese company exercised a put option. The resulting litigation led to an award of Rs8,450 crore to DoCoMo. Of this, the Siva groups share was Rs694 crore.The September legal notice from the Siva group and a letter to Mistry in October 2013 from Sivasankaran refer to Tata Teleservicess dire need for equity, and present the Siva groups investment in the company as a sort of lifeline.This representation was disputed by Mistry in his response to the letter. I have been advised by Mr (Ratan) Tata that the investment made by the Siva Group was made principally on the consideration that the telecom sector was fast-growing and represented a good investment opportunity. In his letter, Sivasankaran referred to an earlier letter to Ratan Tata in 2011 seeking assistance in finding a buyer for the Siva groups holding in Tata Teleservices.He further asks Mistry for a fair resolution (presumably a buyback of his holdings) in line with the mutually benevolent relation between the Tata group and Siva group which made the Siva group walk the extra miles to support the Tata group by undertaking risks which no financial investor acting in self-interest would.From Rays comments, it looks like that resolution is headed for the courts.",2016-11-09,8UuRA0q7zaqX07hXw3QxPL,"At his penultimate Tata Sons board meeting as chairman, Cyrus Mistry raised the issue, the documents show",both,01:31,Cyrus Mistry was trying to get Siva group to pay share of DoCoMo award
0.39,"Mumbai: National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), the developer of the interface that allows customers to transfer money across banks, has asked ICICI Bank Ltd to reverse a decision to block transactions from Flipkarts payments app PhonePe. 
				   
				NPCI gave a clean chit to PhonePe, an app based on the unified payments interface (UPI), in a press statement released on Thursday evening after a review and discussions with ICICI Bank and Yes Bank Ltd, the banker to PhonePe. We would like to state that ICICI Bank has been advised to open UPI transactions immediately, NPCI said in the statement. We have also advised banks to adhere to the merchant on-boarding guidelines meticulously from the angle of interoperability of merchant app so that such disputes are avoided.NCPIs statement comes in response to concerns raised by ICICI Bank regarding transactions done on PhonePe. The bank said that the creation of @ybl virtual payment address that Phone Pe uses violates the interoperability rules of the UPI platform.ICICI blocks PhonePe transactions in sign of banks moving to protect payments turfAn ICICI Bank spokesperson said NPCI had given the bank a written assurance that PhonePe will allow interoperability. As soon as this is corrected, ICICI Bank will start allowing UPI transactions to resume on this app, the spokesperson said. ICICI Bank is one of the 10 promoters of NPCI and owned 7.47% of its shares as on 22 January 2016, according to the Watal committee report. In September, NPCI said it had broad-based its shareholding to include 46 new banks, but didnt specify what the new shareholding structure is.Yes Bank defended PhonePe in a statement to stock exchanges, stating that the app had complied with all the rules laid down by NCPI. All member banks who are offering UPI services have undergone exactly the same process and were allowed to go live only after complying with the same process, said Yes Bank.On Sunday, the lender said it had temporarily blocked transactions originating from PhonePe, pending the resolution of its concerns related to restrictive practices followed by the app. This entity is following restrictive practices allowing users to make payments with only its UPI handle, which is in contravention to the UPI guidelines of interoperability and choice that empowers a customer to choose any app to make payments through UPI, an ICICI spokesperson said.Flipkarts PhonePe crosses 10 million downloads on Google Play StorePhonePes co-founder and chief executive officer Sameer Nigam took to Twitter on 14 January to allege that ICICI was abruptly blocking its customers from using the app. Separately, in an open letter released on Tuesday, the company said that more than 20,000 UPI transactions amounting to more than Rs5 crore by value had failed after ICICI Banks action. We followed all the detailed guidelines and procedures laid down by NPCI for an app to go live on UPI. We went through over a 100+ use case test cases, detailed certification, vulnerability assessment, penetration testing and third-party application security testing, before NPCI gave us permission to go live. PhonePe has been live since August 2016 and none of these issues have been raised earlier, PhonePe clarified in its letter.PhonePe said in its letter it wasnt fully compliant with NPCIs Android Intent Calls guidelines, but added that the deadline for compliance was 31  January. It also pointed out that other UPI apps including Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) have not been updated to meet these guidelines. These guidelines state that when a payment is to be made, an app will initiate an intent call to other UPI apps present on a mobile device. PhonePe declined to comment on Thursday, saying it had not got any official communication from NPCI yet. This is the second instance of a commercial bank blocking transactions arising from non-bank mobile wallet and payment services companies. On 4 January, CNBC-TV18 reported that State Bank of India (SBI) had blocked net banking transactions with e-wallet companies, although it allowed customers to top up their mobile wallets with debit and credit cards. At that time, SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya had said that service was blocked because of security concerns.Since the government decided to ban Rs500 and Rs1,000 currency notes on 8 November, it has announced several measures to encourage cashless transactions including waiving off debit card transaction fees to offering discounts for using digital payments to buy fuel. The biggest beneficiaries of this move have been digital payment firms and wallet operators.

0.22,"Medium and heavy commercial vehicles (trucks) hit a roadblock in June, with sales growth falling below expectations.
				   
				Add to this, the rentals commanded by trucks on key routes dipped for the first time in 21 months.Tata Motors Ltd, the market leader in commercial vehicles, reported a significant 11% year-on-year (y-o-y) drop in June sales.This came after a 23% y-o-y rise in May.Further, even sales of the second biggest truck manufacturer Ashok Leyland Ltd were a mere 8% higherboth in May and Junewhen compared with a year ago.Analysts hope that this slowdown is the result of scorching growth rates in the earlier months when pent-up demand pushed up trucks sales.Most say that it is a temporary blip. They believe the monsoon would have affected some distribution logistics, too.But whats more surprising is the inability of truckers to pass on the hike in diesel prices to customers. Freight rates on even arterial routes such as Delhi-Mumbai-Delhi fell by 1.5% on 1 July, in spite of two rounds of hikes in diesel prices. The industry was expecting a 2.75-3.25% hike in rentals. According to the Indian Foundation of Transport Research and Training, the arrival of fruits and vegetables was 15% lower this season. Meanwhile, demand for transport from sectors such as cement, fertilizers and timber was also disappointing. Sadly, the so-called green shoots of recovery are yet to seep into the core sectors.A months drop or stagnation in rentals is not bothersome, unless it continues. If it becomes a trend, then investors in truck manufacturing firms will have to worry since weak rentals will lower the enthusiasm to purchase new trucks. That will be followed by a fall in truck sales.Amid these worrying signs, light commercial vehicles sales growth has been more stable, perhaps because the recovery in that segment was delayed when compared with trucks.Stock prices of Ashok Leyland and Tata Motors have been wobbly in the last couple of months, although they had outperformed the other auto segments through the recovery.

0.8,"London: Oil bounced back from a one-week low on Thursday as the International Energy Agency (IEA) said global oil markets were tightening even before cuts promised by organisation of petroleum exporting countries (Opec) and other producers could take shape. 
				   
				Oil prices have gyrated this year as the markets focus has swung from hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and others producers to fears that a rebound in US shale production could swamp any such reductions.Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, was up 27 cents at $54.19 a barrel by 3.45pm after closing down 2.8% in the previous session. US West Texas Intermediate crude oil was up 25 cents at $51.33 per barrel, having dropped to a one-week low on Wednesday at $50.91 a barrel.The IEA said that while it was far too soon to gauge Opec members levels of compliance with promised cuts, commercial oil inventories in the developed world fell for a fourth consecutive month in November, with another decline projected for December. It raised its 2016 demand growth estimate, and said the data indicated that rising demand was slowly tightening global oil markets.Still, analysts warned that keeping to the cuts was crucial, particularly as a resilient US shale industry threatened to add more barrels to the market. Discipline and strict adherence to the new quotas will be needed probably throughout 2017 and beyond to see the long-awaited and sustainable rebalancing finally arrive, PVM Oil Associates analyst Tamas Varga said in a note. Opec itself said its cuts would help balance the market, and said its output had already fallen in December. But it also pointed to the possibility of a rebound in US output amid higher oil prices. Stocks data coming out of the United States sent more mixed signals. American Petroleum Institute (API) data on Wednesday showed that US crude stocks fell by 5.04 million barrels in the week to 13 January, well above the expectations of a 342,000-barrel decline.But the data also showed larger-than-expected, and potentially bearish, increases in stocks of gasoline and distillates.

				Prahlads appointment last week seems to suggest that the founder-promoters, none of whom are on the board, finally have their man on it. Prahlad certainly seems to be a nominee of the founders, said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of proxy advisory and corporate governance firm InGovern Research Services. It is clear that by having Prahlad on the board, the founders want access to the board and ability to influence decisions.Prahlads Bengaluru-based firm, Surya Software Systems Pvt. Ltd, also does some business with Infosys.Infosys maintains that work done by Surya with Finacle, Infosyss core banking platform, is not large and Prahlads appointment is in compliance with the relevant definition under the Companies Act. That could well be the case. The Board receives several inputs from various quarters, and takes decisions solely in the best interest of the Company. These include CEO compensation and inductees to the Board, said a spokeswoman for Infosys. Murthy did not respond to queries on the appointment.Subramanian said his firm will surely question Infosyss decision to appoint Prahlad when the company seeks shareholder approval.An Infosys executive who spoke on condition of anonymity claimed the appointment of Prahlad was yet another indication of Murthys continued influence at Infosys. The worrying thing of this appointment of an executive perceived to be close to the founder is what message it sends to the senior leaders at the company, said the Infosys executive. If the board agrees to have a representative of the founder, then leaders clearly are told who is more important. So, can the CEO really have his team rally around him?Current chief executive officer (CEO) Vishal Sikka is Infosys first non-founder CEO. To be sure, Infosys has categorically denied the existence of twin power centres at the company. First, there is no such twin power centres. That is completely wrong, and that will be very unfair to the promoters, R. Seshasayee, non-executive chairman of Infosys, said in an interview last month. Because, like I mentioned, Murthy has been an exceptional leader who has chosen to stay away and only give advice when sought from. So it will be utterly wrong (to claim otherwise).Seshasayees response came against the background of several reports, including in Mint, that said the promoters were unhappy with the high compensation offered to Sikka, the appointment of Punita Kumar-Sinha as an independent director, the high severance package initially offered to former chief financial officer Rajiv Bansal and its subsequent termination. Seshasayee clarified in the interview that the severance agreement would be administrated in line with the rights of the parties.Infosyss board has Sikka and chief operating officer U.B. Pravin Rao as executive members and eight independent directors. Other than Seshasayee and Prahlad, the other independent directors are Kumar-Sinha, Ravi Venkatesan, John Etchemendy, Jeffrey Lehman, Roopa Kudva and Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw.Sikka became the firms first non-founder CEO in August 2014.

0.09,"Mumbai: Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has requested the petroleum ministry to remove the cap on the quantity of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) that the company is permitted to sell through its own parallel marketing channel, two people aware of the development said.
				   
				In a notification on 29 July 2015, the ministry had directed RIL, which sells LPG cylinders under the Reliance Gas brand, to restrict its own marketing of domestically produced LPG to 10,000 tonnes per month.RIL has approached the ministry requesting them to remove the cap of 10,000 tonnes per month altogether, said the first person mentioned abovean official from an oil marketing company who declined to be identified.Although the ministry has not heeded RILs request so far, there are continuous follow-ups by the company, the person added.RIL did not respond to an email questionnaire sent on 27 December. As per the LPG Control Order on regulation of supply and distribution, issued by the petroleum ministry in 2000, all cooking gas produced domestically must be supplied to state-run oil marketing companiesBharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC). As per the ministrys order, RIL sells the LPG produced at its two refineries at Jamnagar, Gujarat, to public sector retailers. However, under a Parallel Marketing Scheme (PMS), private companies are allowed to import and market LPG to bulk consumers.In July 2016, RIL launched its small-capacity 5-kg cylinders, which qualify as free trade LPG (FTL). This means they are not subsidised by the government, unlike the commonly used 14.2-kg domestic cylinders. The larger capacity cylinders are sold at market price to consumers who have the option of receiving a government subsidy in their bank accounts. Private firms are not entitled to government subsidies, unlike state-run oil marketing companies, and have to sell fuel at market price. But with the governments bid to restrict the volume of subsidy by barring consumers earning more than Rs10 lakh per annum from taking advantage of subsidised LPG, an attractive market for LPG has opened up to private players such as RIL.",2017-01-10,8sPLXhCZngGwbtYpj8eYWN,"RIL plea comes following a Central govt notification that the Reliance Gas brand to restrict its own marketing of domestically produced LPG to 10,000 tonnes per month",both,09:58,RIL seeks removal of LPG cap 
0.19,"The broad reading is that gas companies results for the December quarter are likely to be relatively weak. 
				   
				City gas distributorsIndraprastha Gas Ltd (IGL) and Mahanagar Gas Ltd (MGL) had delivered a good financial performance for the half year ended September. But both companies are expected to suffer the adverse consequences of demonetization on compressed natural gas (CNG) demand during the December quarter. As a result, there could be some negative impact on CNG volume growth. Further, reduced traffic during high smog days in the quarter is also expected to weigh on IGLs results.According to Edelweiss Securities Ltd, IGLs Ebitda margin will be squeezed, given the increase in spot/term LNG (liquefied natural gas) price, while realization has been cut following the 18% reduction in domestic gas price. For MGL, we are estimating Ebitda/standard cu. m (scm) to contract 12% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) to Rs6/scm, said Edelweiss Securities in its results preview.Ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.The results of Petronet LNG Ltd, too, are likely to be comparatively subdued, after a fabulous performance in the first half of FY17. For one, spot LNG prices increased sharply during the December quarter, compared with the September quarter. And, then, LNG demand was below expectations. Citi Research expects lower utilization for Petronet LNG on the back of lower volumes (lower October and November imports on higher spot prices + competition from the Dabhol LNG terminal), driving a 16% q-o-q Ebitda decline.Meanwhile, volume offtake for GAIL (India) Ltds petrochemicals segment is expected to be adversely impacted due to demonetization. But the good news is earnings improvement is expected to sustain. GAILs earnings have been improving steadily since bottoming out in 1HFY16 and analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd expect the trend to continue with a 5% q-o-q increase in Ebitda. For the stock, investors will do well to follow the ramp-up of GAILs expanded petrochemical capacity at Pata in Uttar Pradesh.But investors have little to complain. After all, these stocks have performed well so far this fiscal. Stocks of Petronet LNG, IGL and GAIL have increased 44.7%, 62% and 29%, respectively. That compares favourably with the 6.7% gain in the benchmark Sensex during the same time frame. MGLs share price has doubled from its issue price of Rs421 a share.

				However the average selling price of the handsets in the key holiday quarter ending in late December may show customers settling for older iPhone 6S models, rather than the iPhone 7, introduced in September, according to some analysts.Recent smartphone customers increasingly are opting for the iPhone 6S, Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz wrote in a note to clients this week as he downgraded his recommendation on Apple stock to hold. We detect increasing concern among industry participants that smartphones in general have evolved technologically to become more than good enough to serve most users digital needs over multiple years or until the device breaks.Apple is scheduled to report quarterly results on 31 January. Analysts currently predict an average selling price, or ASP, of $688 for the iPhone line in the holiday quarter, down from $691 a year earlier, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg News. Thats even though the iPhone 7 Plus model costs $20 more than the iPhone 6S Plus when it was introduced. A new iPhone launch has in previous years consistently led to an increase in ASP.An ASP decline may suggest the iPhone 7s better camera, faster processor, improved battery life and water resistance werent enough to draw customers away from the 6S. The trend would underscore concern that smartphone advances nowadays arent enough to maintain the bonanza iPhone revenue growth that the Cupertino, California-based company used to enjoy.We know what a smartphone looks like and does, billionaire technology investor Peter Thiel told The New York Times recently. Its not an area where there will be any more innovation.Apples revenue decline in the last fiscal year, which ended in September, represented the first such drop since 2001, as falling iPhone sales dragged down the total. Industrywide smartphone shipments were likely flat in 2016, according to researcher IDC. As recently as the second quarter of 2015, the market was growing more than 10 percent a year.Apple is likely to have sold about 76 million phones over the holiday quarter, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg News, up from 75 million handsets a year earlier. Analysts expect revenue to rise 2% to $77 billion, with surging sales from the App Store and Music streaming service compensating for any dip in iPhone takings.Even after revenue from services soared last year, the iPhone still accounted for almost two-thirds of Apples $216 billion annual sales. The handsets importance means any ASP weakness will focus investor attention more keenly on the next iPhone, which is likely to be unveiled later this year, the devices 10th anniversary.Demand for this model, which analysts tentatively dub the iPhone 8, 10 or X, will be gauged by Apples sales forecast for the three months through March. Should it fall short of the $54 billion expectation, that may suggest slack demand for current products as buyers await the new model.The iPhone 10 gives Apple a little bit of protection, said Gene Munster, the co-founder of Loup Ventures and long-time Apple analyst.The new device gives executives a ready excuse should the March outlook disappoint, he noted. Its a good get out of jail free card, since investors want to own the stock for the next product cycle, Munster said.

				This is the second large set of orders KEC has won in two weeks. On 17 March, it had announced new orders worth Rs.1,041 crore.With the latest gain, the stock is up 23% from February lows, recouping almost half of the losses it saw earlier this year. It lost one-third of its value in January and February as the slump in crude oil prices stoked concerns about its business in the West Asian countries. Around 15% of KECs outstanding order book is from that region. In a conference call with analysts, KEC had said it is yet to see any slackening of its order pipeline in West Asia. But that did not cut much icethe stock fell after the third quarter results.Instead, what is helping the stock are strong order inflows and management commentary on prospects in India and other markets. The latest order wins comes on the back of a 26% rise in inflows till the first week of February. More than half of the 17 March orders are from overseas (Ghana, Americas). Last weeks orders are mostly from India. This lends credence to the belief that diversification (both geographical and in services) is helping KEC navigate the business environment better, especially the overseas markets from which it derives half of the business.The company is seeing large tenders opening in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. Operations in Mexico are turning around. In India, apart from transmission, opportunities are emerging in the railways and solar energy sectors. KEC highlighted it is also seeing healthy traction in solar and railway segments (tenders worth Rs.25 billion (Rs.2,500 crore) up for bidding), Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt.

Revenues were flat, or increased just 0.2%, in the first nine months of 2015-16. From Rs.3,000 crore in February, KECs deal pipeline increased to Rs.4,200 crore, the company told ET Now.

0.25,"Tokyo: It turns out Masayoshi Son isnt ready to retire after all.
				   
				Just a year ago, SoftBank Group Corp.s founder looked poised to fulfil his long-stated plan of stepping aside in his 60s. He had a global telecom empire, track record of spectacularly successful investments and a bright young successor. Instead, the 59-year-old edged aside his heir apparent, cut the biggest deal of his career yet and revealed on Friday his ambition to become one of the worlds most powerful investors.SoftBank said it is forming a new fund to put as much as $100 billion in the global technology industry in the next five years, partnering with Saudi Arabias public investment fund to find companies that will become influential in the future. By comparison, all the venture capital funds in the world disbursed a record $129.5 billion in funding in 2015, according to CB Insights.The man who once proclaimed his goal of creating the worlds most valuable company isnt hiding his ambition: Over the next decade, he aims to be the biggest investor in technology.In other words, Japans second-richest man isnt going anywhere. Son in 2014 brought in Nikesh Arora, luring the former Google executive with a pay package that rivaled those of Apple Inc.s Tim Cook and Walt Disney Co.s Bob Iger. He spent two years grooming him as a successor only to change his mind in June. A month later SoftBank announced plans for a $32 billion takeover of chip designer ARM Holdings Plc, Sons biggest bet to date and a wager on the future of interconnected devices.For some time, it seemed like Son has fatigued, considering retirement and bringing in Arora. It is pretty clear now that he is still full of zeal, said Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive officer of Myojo Asset Management Co.It is not yet clear who will call the shots at what is tentatively named SoftBank Vision Fund and the Japanese company declined to comment further, noting the fund had not yet closed. SoftBank named Rajeev Misra, its head of strategic finance, to lead the project.Son has made tens of billions in returns from investments in companies including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, Yahoo and Supercell Oy, and the new fund will likely pursue a similar strategy of backing technology companies at all stages. While Arora was SoftBanks president, the company had plans to put about $3 billion into startups each year.During his two year tenure, Arora spearheaded investments in Indian e-commerce provider Snapdeal.com, ride-hailing service Ola Cabs, real-estate website Housing.com and hotel-booking app Oyo Rooms. In October 2015, SoftBank led a $1 billion fund-raising round for US-based online lender Social Finance Inc.Over the next decade, the SoftBank Vision Fund will be the biggest investor in the technology sector, Son, chairman and chief executive officer of SoftBank, said in a statement Friday. We will further accelerate the information revolution by contributing to its development.The Saudi government will consider putting money into the fund and become the lead investment partner, SoftBank said in the statement. The Tokyo-based company, which will invest as much as $25 billion, signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with the Saudis, who may put in as much as $45 billion over the next five years. Other large global investors may participate to increase the pool to $100 billion.Also Read: SoftBank tech fund to invest up to $100 billion with Saudi ArabiaSoftBank said that the fund will be reflected on its consolidated financial statements, without giving further details. Its shares rose as much as 3.7% in Tokyo. The stock had gained 5.8% this year before today, compared with a 12% decline in the benchmark Nikkei 225 index.The company is stepping up investment activity even though it has more than $100 billion in debt. SoftBank has relied on borrowing and earnings from its domestic telecom operations to pay for investments in start-ups in India, US and China while balancing losses at its US subsidiary Sprint Corp. By tapping outside investors, Son will be able to cut more ambitious deals than he could on his own.Also Read: SoftBanks robot Pepper gets to work at Taiwan bankARM acquisition has brought Son to a limit of how much he can invest just with SoftBanks balance sheet, Myojos Kikuchi said.The companys high-speed Internet and wireless services in Japan generated 1.16 trillion yen ($11.2 billion) of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the fiscal year ended 31 March. SoftBank has 3.5 trillion yen of bonds maturing in the next five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Its conceivable that after capturing the core of the Internet of Things with ARM, Son will next look to other semiconductors, electronic components and software, said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute in Tokyo. SoftBank has a proven track record of investment successes. They are looking for another Alibaba. Bloomberg",2016-10-14,9WT37k7ShXkhf2Xh8ZT6aJ,"SoftBank is forming a new fund to put as much as $100 billion in the global technology industry in the next five years, partnering with Saudi Arabias public investment fund",both,19:29,SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son aims to be biggest tech investor with Saudi deal
-0.68,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond rose to 6.43% on Wednesday, from its previous close of 6.407%. While the finance minister was making the budget speech in Parliament, the bond yield actually dropped to 6.38%, but rose later.
				   
				The reason behind the drop was confusion about the exact size of the net government borrowing in fiscal 2018. Initially, the figure was quoted as Rs3.48 trillion against the current fiscal years Rs4.07 trillion. However, the comparison is not entirely correct as the 2018 figure does not take into account the buyback of bonds.ALSO READ | Budget 2017 gives clues about demonetisation deposits in banksAfter adjusting for buyback of bonds, the net borrowing programme in 2018 would be virtually unchangedRs3.48 trillion vs 3.47 trillion. And, without the adjustments, the comparable figures are Rs4.23 trillion in 2018 vs Rs4.07 trillion in 2017. The gross annual borrowing remains virtually unchanged at around Rs5.8 trillion. Once the mathematics was clear to the market, bond yields rose.It could be a knee-jerk reaction as ultimately, the market cannot ignore the good newsthe government is determined to contain the fiscal deficit at 3.2% of Indias gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018. This has also given rise to the hope of a rate cut in the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBI) next monetary policy on 8 February.Indeed, the fiscal discipline brightens the chances for a rate cut next week but I would still say its not a given as yetthe chance of a rate cut next week is 50:50. There could be a rate cut in coming months but it may or may not materialize next week.ALSO READ | A remarkably restrained Union budget, going by the numbersApart from the containment of fiscal deficit at 3.2% of GDP, the other factor that could influence the Monetary Policy Committee (which will have a new memberdeputy governor in charge of monetary policy Viral Acharya) that takes the call on interest rate is the drop in retail inflation to 3.41% in December from 3.63% in the previous month and 5.61% a year ago.Food inflation, which accounts for more than half of the consumer price index or CPI basket, is the driving factor and we may not see inflation going down further from here. The external factors which prevented RBI from going in for a rate cut in December have worsened since then and the impact of the so-called demonetisation is still not clear.In other words, the reasons cited by the six-member MPC for RBI for deciding against a rate cut in December are very much there and it can once again refrain from cutting the rate at its next meeting.At the first meeting of MPC in October, RBI brought down its policy rate to 6.25%.ALSO READ | Union Budget 2017: Key highlights and themesThe other reason behind a likely decision against any rate cut could be the liquidity-driven monetary transmission. Flooded with money post-demonetization, some of the banks have pared their benchmark rates by as much as 90 basis points in January. One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. Much of the money that flowed into the banking system in November and December is in the form of low-cost current and savings accounts. Banks do not pay any interest on current accounts and most pay 4% on savings accounts. With no sign of corporate credit picking up, banks have cut their loan rates for mortgages aggressively.It is for certain though that RBI will continue with its accommodative monetary policy stance. And, of course, there could be a surprise in the form of a rate cutlike the market experience in December when the MPC chose not to go for a rate cut against the consensus estimate.Tamal Bandyopadhyay, consulting editor at Mint, is adviser to Bandhan Bank.

0.53,"Frankfurt/Tokyo: Volkswagen AG dethroned Toyota Motor Corp. last year to become the worlds best-selling automaker for the first time, propelled by surging demand in China which has been largely unaffected by the diesel-cheating scandal.
				   
				Volkswagen sold a record 10.3 million vehicles in 2016, outpacing its rival with a 3.8% gain from a year earlier. Toyotas global sales, including its Hino Motors Ltd and Daihatsu Motor Co. units, rose 0.2% to 10.2 million vehicles in 2016, the Japanese automaker said on Monday.Taking the global sales crown marks the bittersweet culmination of an aggressive expansion that former chief executive officer Martin Winterkorn kick-started 10 years ago. While surging demand in China and the popularity of the upscale Audi and Porsche brands lineups boosted worldwide deliveries, the VW marque lost market share in Europe, its second-biggest region, following revelations in 2015 that the company manipulated diesel engines to pass emissions tests.ALSO READ: News in numbers | Volkswagen to recall 6 lakh faulty premium Audi cars from USVW group deliveries last year rose 12.2% in China, where the scandal is a non-issue because the automaker sells almost no diesel vehicles there. Sales in Europe gained 4%, less than the overall sector, while the crisis fallout hurt demand in the US and recessions cut sales in Russia and South America.The increase in sales tax on small-engine vehicles is set to weigh on deliveries this year in China, Volkswagens biggest national market, while in Germany, its home country, the namesake VW brand has started scaling back its large leasing fleet for employees, slowing growth. The marque accounted for almost 6 million of global group deliveries last year, and its targeting more than 3 million car sales in China this year.Toyotas sales last year lagged behind Volkswagen mainly due to its performance in the US and China, with demand for its flagship Camry sedan waning in the US and sales in China expanding at a slower pace than the overall market. Looking ahead, Toyota must contend with possible trade tensions as US President Donald Trump pressures foreign automakers to make more cars and trucks in the US.The development of the US market is set to decide if VW can stay ahead of Toyota this year, Sascha Gommel, a Frankfurt-based analyst at Commerzbank AG, said by phone. If the Chinese and European markets continue to be solid and the US market weakens as I expect, VW might stay first in 2017 as Toyota has a larger exposure to North America.Since his inauguration, Trump has withdrawn the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade accord, reaffirmed a campaign promise to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement involving Mexico and met with automakers to persuade them to keep production within the US.ALSO READ: Toyota planning a made-for-India hybrid car in five yearsToyota will invest $10 billion in the US over the next five years, maintaining its pace of spending during the last half decade, joining other manufacturers with highlighting projects in response to pressure from Trump to create jobs in America. After criticizing Toyotas plans to build a Corolla plant in Mexico, Trump rebuked Japan last week for sending the US hundreds of thousands of cars from what he said were the biggest ships Ive ever seen.Trump is a bigger risk for Toyota than for Volkswagen because the German carmaker has a small exposure to the US market, said Ken Miyao, an analyst at Tokyo-based market researcher Carnorama. Toyota has made investment to build a new plant in Mexico and will have limited options to appeal to Trump.As part of a far-reaching overhaul under new division chief Herbert Diess, the VW brand has embarked on a restructuring push outside China and will boost its lineup of sport utility vehicles, the industrys fastest-growing segment, where it lags behind Toyota and General Motors. Growth in China in recent years had masked weak returns in Europe and an ill-fated product strategy in Brazil, a former VW stronghold. In a US. comeback push, its rolling out the Atlas mid-size SUV and smaller Tiguan crossover with a longer wheelbase.The VW brand in Europe still largely depends on the Golf hatchback and Passat sedan and station wagon, models in market segments that are being squeezed as customers shift to SUVs. It has revamped the Golf to stabilize sales, and that vehicles decline has been partly offset by surging demand for the updated Tiguan SUV.VW executives have become tight-lipped about sales-volume targets as the companys focus shifts toward safeguarding profits and preparing for a future where vehicle ownership becomes less relevant as ride-hailing and car-sharing gain in popularity.Our new strategy through 2025 doesnt include any sales targets any more, Dietmar Voggenreiter, sales chief at VWs premium-car unit Audi said in an interview this month. These times are over. Bloomberg",2017-01-30,9eX4wmiq6DXRXgrrWyhKNI,"Volkswagen sold a record 10.3 million vehicles in 2016, outpacing its rival Toyota with a 3.8% gain from a year earlier",competitor,17:40,Volkswagen takes global sales crown from Toyota amid diesel crisis

				Net profit stood at Rs2,441.82 crore, as against Rs3,018.13 crore a year earlier, marginally lower than estimates. According to a Bloomberg poll of 20 analysts, the bank was expected to post a net profit of Rs2,466.7 crore for the quarter.The earnings are in line with expectations, said Siddharth Purohit, senior research analyst with brokerage firm Angel Broking Ltd. Earnings will remain muted for next couple of quarters.ICICI Bank shares fell 0.7% to Rs268.95 on Tuesday, paring this years gains to 5.4%. Earnings were announced after the markets closed. The S&P BSE Bankex Index has gained 7.5% this year.The lenders gross bad loans ballooned to Rs37,716. 73 crore at the end of December, rising 17.21% from the quarter ago. As a percentage of total loans, gross bad loans stood at 7.9% at the end of December, up from 6.82% at the end of the previous quarter. Bad loans net of provisions were 4.35% of advances. During the three months ended December, Rs 7057 crore worth of fresh loans turned bad, lower than the previous two quarters. About 40% of these were from a so-called watchlist the bank released in March. ICICI Banks managing director and chief executive officer Chanda Kochchar said the watch list, which includes sub-investment grade loans given to troubled sectors, declined to Rs.27,536 crore at the end of December from Rs 44,065 crore nine months earlier. Around Rs 12,057 crore worth of loans from the watch list went bad and Rs 4165 crore worth of loans were resolved during the last nine months.Rise in bad loans had a dampening effect on net interest income in the quarter, Hatim Broachwala, an analyst at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities told Bloomberg. The banks ability to prevent any further deterioration in asset quality in the slowing economy is going to be the key to profit growth in coming quarters.Net interest income (NII), or the core income a bank earns by giving loans, fell by 1.64% to Rs5,363.35 crore as loan growth slowed owing to the effects of demonetisation and the rise in bad loans.At the end of December, ICICI Banks advances rose 5.21% to Rs4.57 trillion.To be sure, ICICI Bank is not the only bank bearing the brunt of rising bad loans and slowing advances. Earlier in January, HDFC Bank Ltd reported its weakest quarterly profit growth in at least 20 years. Rival Axis Bank Ltd said net profit for the December quarter fell 73.4% while its gross bad loans ratio jumped by 1 percentage point over the last three months.It is very difficult to give any guidance on resolution of stressed assets as there are too many moving parts involved, Kochhar said on a conference call with reporters. Our endeavour is to resolve as much as we can in this year itself.ICICI Banks non-interest income fell 6.61% from a year ago to Rs 3938. 31 crore. However, this was largely because the bank booked a one-time income of Rs 1243 crore on sale of shareholding in ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co Ltd in the December 2015 quarter.

0.85,"London/ Singapore: Oil prices rose on Tuesday, supported by a falling US dollar and Saudi Arabia saying it would adhere to organisation of petroleum exporting countries (Opecs) commitment to cut output.
				   
				Gains were capped by rising US production and scepticism that the Opec as a whole would comply with its commitments to reduce supplies.Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were up 77 cents at $56.63 per barrel at 3.50pm. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 88 cents at $53.25 per barrel.The dollar, along with stocks and bond yields, fell across the board on Tuesday after US President-elect Donald Trump said that the strong greenback was hurting US competitiveness.Traders said oil drew some support from top crude exporter Saudi Arabia, which said it would adhere strictly to its commitment to cut output under the agreement between Opec and other producers like Russia.Under the agreement, Opec, Russia and other non-Opec producers have pledged to cut oil output by nearly 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd), initially for six months, to bring supplies back in line with consumption.The market genuinely seems quite happy here (around $55) ... but people are watching with caution as the slightest hint of this Opec/non-Opec agreement going wrong is going to drive the market down, said Matt Stanley, a fuel broker at Freight Investor Services (FIS) in Dubai.Despite this, crude futures have fallen 5%  since their early January peaks because of doubts over the oil producers willingness to fully comply with the cuts.Traders are also watching rising US output with interest, as this could offset supply cuts elsewhere. The market is focused on the build in US production which is nearly up to 9 million bpd - up from 8.5 million bpd last June and close to 2014 production levels, said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at Sydneys CMC Markets.With US crude clearly above $50 a barrel, we are getting a supply-side response which is pushing production higher, he said.Further weighing on crude, at least in the short term, have been refinery outages in the Middle East and Asia over the past week, traders said. Analysts also said that steps to prop up oil prices through a cut in supplies could be self-defeating.For each $10 per barrel increase in oil prices, oil demand will decline by 10 basis points. While consensus expects demand-growth of 1.3 million bpd in 2017 (vs 1.4 million bpd in 2016), we see risks to the downside as demand growth in China and India starts to moderate, AB Bernstein said.

-0.55,"Mumbai: With the government having de-legalized Rs500 and Rs1,000 bank notes, there is mounting interest in electronic payment mechanisms, with mobile payment firms Paytm, Ola Money and Mobikwik reporting increased downloads of their apps.
				   
				The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), on its part, has also been goading people to use electronic modes of payments.Such usage will alleviate pressure on the physical currency and also enhance the experience of living in the digital world, RBI had said on Saturday.Is India ready to go fully cashless then? The short answer is no. The long answer, is slightly more nuanced, but still a no. A look at the cashless payment infrastructure tell us why this is so.As of 30 September, the number of point of sale (PoS) devices, which accepted debit and credit cards as modes of payments at merchant outlets, was only 1.49 million, RBIs monthly bulletin shows. Still, the number is higher than the 1.38 million reported on 31 March. These outlets include railway stations, airports, hospital counters and supermarkets.In comparison, Indians had nearly 730 million debit cards and 27 million credit cards at September end. It isnt clear, however, how many people have more than one card.These debit cards in the system also include about 200 million RuPay cards linked to over 250 million bank accounts under the Prime Ministers Jan Dhan Yojana. So far, about 24% of Jan Dhan accounts have zero balance, as reported by the financial inclusion movements website. And, according to a 13 September report by The Indian Express, 18 public sector banks and their 16 regional rural subsidiaries had just over 10 million accounts with only Rs1 in them, as bankers try to cut down the number of zero balance accounts under them.An even better indicator would be the money that is spent at these terminals. According to RBI data, people used debit cards to make nearly 1.2 billion transactions worth Rs1.6 trillion across India in FY16.While the transactions and amount may seem high, India also used debit cards to make over 8 billion transactions worth Rs 25.37 trillion at automated teller machines (ATMs) during that period. These were mostly cash withdrawals and some transfers made to other accounts and credit card bills.Credit cards recorded 785 million transactions on PoS terminals, where an amount of over Rs2.4 trillion was spent. It is clear then that India is largely using its plastic cards to withdraw cash, which it spends later.Mobile wallets, where services such as Paytm, Mobikwik and Ola Money offer ease of transaction to customers are still in the starting phase of adoption as only around one-fifth of Indias population has a smartphone where these services can be used. According to GSMA Intelligence, a mobile operator database, there were about 275 million smartphones in India as of June.RBIs monthly bulletin points out mobile wallets were used to make 604 million transactions in FY16 by customers who spent about Rs20.6 billion. Mobile bankingor transactions done via applications provided by banks to transfer money, pay utility bills and check balancesrecorded 390 million transactions worth over Rs4 trillion. Unified Payments Interface (UPI), the National Payments Corporation of Indias (NPCIs) ambitious payments interface which enables person-to-person transactions without the need to exchange sensitive bank account information is yet to fully take off. While NPCI has been able to sign up 26 banks to the UPI platform, which went live in August, the number of downloads and transactions hasnt picked up. Only about 20-25% of all transactions that happen in India are cashless. With this demonetization drive, we should see this rising and people opting for mobile wallets more. However, it is true the infrastructure for acceptance is still an issue that needs to be overcome. Possibly, this would be the time for improving that, said Karthik Srinivasan, senior vice-president, ICRA Ltd.Another factor that works against cashless transactions is the perceived security problems. Last month, details of about 32 million cards were likely to have been compromised due to a security breach in an ATM network. This led to State Bank of India (SBI) issuing 600,000 new cards to customers who could have been victims of this.

				When the companys US restaurants started serving Egg McMuffins and other morning fare at all hours in 2015, the change elated customers and fueled a yearlong sales surge. But now the effect is waning: While overall earnings beat analysts estimates last quarter, domestic same-store sales fell 1.3%.The slowdown from all-day breakfast leaves McDonalds in search of its next big source of US growth. The company is looking to technology, such as touch screens and mobile ordering, to help fuel domestic sales. But its not clear how quickly that will pay off, said Michael Halen, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.We still dont know where the sales are going to come from, he said. People are in wait-and-see mode. McDonalds shares fell as much as 2% to $119.82 on Monday after the results were posted.

Profit was $1.44 a share in the period, compared with an estimate of $1.41.In some markets, including the UK and Germany, McDonalds is further ahead with technology upgrades such as self-service kiosks. Sales in the companys international lead markets segment, which includes those key countries, rose 2.8% in the fourth quarter.

The company has lagged behind competitors on the technology front. Starbucks Corp. and Dunkin Donuts boast millions of rewards-program members, while Taco Bell allows diners to order via mobile app. Those types of programs frequently allow restaurants to lock in customers.Challenging comparisonChief executive officer Steve Easterbrook embarked on a turnaround at the worlds largest fast-food chain when he took the helm two years ago. Expanding breakfasta longtime request of customerswas a key part of the strategy, and it helped pull McDonalds out of a domestic sales slump last year. But the sales bump has waned.The company blamed its US sales decrease in the fourth quarter on the challenging comparison with the all-day breakfast boost it got a year earlier.McDonalds also has worked to improve its food quality, a bid to appeal to a new generation of American diners. That includes removing artificial ingredients from popular items on its menu, eliminating preservatives from chicken nuggets and nixing high-fructose corn syrup from its buns. In other moves, McDonalds declared its chicken antibiotic-free in the US, added real butter to its breakfast muffins and pledged to use cage-free eggs.But McDonalds still faces an industrywide restaurant slowdown, bringing pressure to lower prices and offer more aggressive promotions.

The assets are valued at about $500 million, one of the people said.The sale ends the foray of SunEdison, once the worlds biggest renewable energy company, into the second-most-populous nation. It sets Greenko up to profit from Prime Narendra Modis goal of boosting clean energy capacity to 175 GW by 2022.SunEdison, which filed for bankruptcy protection in April, listed $16.1 billion of debt in court filings, making it the biggest US bankruptcy of 2016.

This is likely to make lenders nervous, and they may show restraint in extending any further credit, until there is clarity regarding the evolving relationship between Tata Sons and the operating businesses. This will have operational implications for listed companies as on 31 March 2016, the Tata group of companies had outstanding debt aggregating around Rs.2.5 trillion, of which about 24% is due within 12 months.

-0.03,"Mumbai: Clean energy companies and their investors are worried about rising instances of state power distribution utilities (discoms) unplugging their generating capacity from the grid and delaying both payments and the signing of power purchase agreements (PPAs). 
				   
				Two of Indias largest renewable energy companies, ReNew Power Ventures Pvt. Ltd and Tata Power Renewable Energy Ltd (TPREL), a subsidiary of Tata Power Co. Ltd, have been hit by such unplugging, also called back-down at their plants in multiple states, company officials said. Projects of other companies including Adani Green Energy Ltd and Hero Future Energies have also been hurt due to back-down and delays in signing PPAs, they added. Some states resort to backing down wind and solar projects, jeopardizing investments already made in the projects, said Rahul Shah, chief executive of TPREL. Discoms in Maharashtra, Tamilnadu, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have also been delaying payments to generators of wind and solar power by as much as 8-10 months, which puts their cash flows under tremendous pressure. These are negative signals for developers and investors who are evaluating the Indian market for investment in new renewable energy capacity, Shah said.According to ReNew Powers estimates, discoms in Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh owe wind energy producers over Rs4000 crore in payments. A ReNew spokesperson said about 500 megawatt (MW) of its solar capacity and a smaller size of wind capacity is stranded in Jharkhand due to delays in signing PPAs.A check of awarded projects shows 1200 MW of solar capacity of ReNew Power, Adani Power and ACME Solar and about 600 MW of wind capacity is stuck for the lack of PPAs in Jharkhand. Adani Power and Hero Future did not respond to emails seeking comment. Many discoms are in poor financial shape and have started going back on their commitment to sign PPAs with solar power producers, multiple people in the renewables business said. In solar projects, which are won through reverse bidding process, a PPA is signed ahead of completion of the project, usually for a period of 25 years. A back-down can happen due to availability of cheaper power elsewhere, lack of transmission infrastructure, absence of demand, or inability of the grid to buy power. Grids usually reserve the right to unplug power because of the variations in the amount of power generated. This practice, called power back-down, leads to losses of billions of units of green power.Several companies have filed petitions against a state utility in Rajasthan on account of this, an official of Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission said on condition of anonymity. Investors are losing confidence, said Seema Changlani, director of Beont Capital, which helps Indian companies set up projects and attract new investments. At times, the grid refuses to purchase renewable power in favour of cheaper thermal power. Investors finance projects on the basis of PPAs and absence of PPAs by discoms can hurt IRRs of these projects.Back-down and delay in payments have become a chronic problem, Dilip Nigam, adviser, ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE) said on the sidelines of an event in Mumbai on Wednesday. Discoms are backing down on renewable energy in the name of security of the grid and we have been taking up the issue separately. Renewable energy should have a must-run status. India has a total wind capacity of 27.4 gigawatt (GW) and solar capacity of about 9 GW. It has set itself the target of adding 100 GW of solar and 60 GW of wind capacity by 2022.The government has set a renewable purchase obligation target for discoms, but this target is not being met. This raises concerns over rising solar capacity and ability of the discoms to buy all of it. This (problem) is becoming bigger by the day, Vinay Rustagi, managing director, renewable energy focused consultancy Bridge to India said.The MNRE wrote to the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission in August highlighting the issue of back-downs. Tarun Kapoor, joint secretary, MNRE wrote in that letter that if any backing down has to be done, thermal power projects should be asked to back down so that some fuel is saved. This (loss of energy from backing down) can make solar power unattractive particularly when projects are being allotted through competitive bidding and tariffs have come down drastically, he wrote. They should be paid full tariff if they are forced to back down in rare cases.Solar energy tariffs have fallen from Rs15 over four years ago to below Rs5 per unit over the past 12 months, in part due to aggressive bidding in reverse auctions. Tariffs are expected to fall to Rs3.50 per unit in the next three years on account of falling cost of equipment and better technology, Mint reported on 26 July.",2016-10-21,ASu58DZtfl5xnomADH13wL,Rising instances of discoms unplugging generating capacity from grid and delaying signing of PPAs ,both,02:58,Renewable energy firms worry about back-down by power discoms
0.76,"London/ Singapore: Oil prices rose for the first time in three days on Wednesday, following news of Saudi supply cuts to Asia, but persistent doubt over output reductions and signs of rising shipments from other producers kept gains in check.
				   
				Brent crude futures were up 41 cents at $54.05 a barrel by 5.03pm, while US West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up 39 cents at $51.21 a barrel.Brent has surrendered nearly 40% of the gains made between late November and early January. Analysts, however, said the slide was unlikely to become more aggressive, given the likelihood of Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbours at least sticking to their pledge to cut output. Few envision that Brent crude at sub-$50 a barrel is a viable price (in the first half of 2017) amid Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) production cuts tightening up the market, SEB commodities strategist Bjarne Schieldrop said.Whether last nights low of $53.58/barrel turns out to be the low point remains to be seen. However, we do think that buying in the territory between the current price of $53.88/b and down to $50/b is probably as good as it gets for buyers in H1.Saudi Arabia, the worlds top oil exporter, has told some of its Asian customers that it will reduce their crude supplies slightly in February. But there is still plenty of oil to fill the gaps left by the Opec. North American drilling is on the rise, while European and Chinese traders are shipping a record 22 million barrels of crude from the North Sea and Azerbaijan to Asia this month. There is still doubt among many market watchers over whether the planned cuts will be enough to rebalance a market that has been oversupplied for the past two years.Traders continued to fret about rising US supply and compliance by Opec to agreed-upon production cuts, ANZ bank said.The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Tuesday that crude production in the United States this year would rise by 110,000 barrels per day to 9 million bpd.Another concern is high US crude stockpiles, with the EIA scheduled to release its latest figures on Wednesday. Opecs second-biggest producer Iraq plans to raise crude exports from its southern port of Basra to an all-time high of 3.641 million bpd in February, keeping shipments high even as Opec production cuts take effect this month.

-0.44,"The first ever London Design Biennale opened this month at Somerset House. Around three dozens nations from six continents were invited to present installations on the theme of Utopia by Design. The India Design Forum spearheaded the Indian installation: Chakraview, curated by Rajshree Pathy. In an interview, Pathy who is chairperson and managing director of Rajshree Sugars and Chemicals Ltd and founder of the India Design Forum, spoke about the exhibit, and the precarious position of design in Indian life. Edited excerpts:
How did you approach the two very complex ideas of India and utopia, and then combine them for this exhibit?It was very challenging for us actually because the Indian utopia exists at multiple levels. We asked a few people around what is their idea of utopia. The answers are so diverse. It could be easily, somebodys meal. On the other hand, it could be a flat in Gurgaon. It could be a private jet. It could be your son going to a good school. Utopias for India are so diverse and yet we coexist with this tension that comes out of these diverse desires. Taking on from that premise, I needed to base this installation on something that had a thread of consistency in every Indians mind. Therefore, as a curator, I thought its best to have references to our mythology, to our learnings. And I tried to keep it as far removed as possible from any political or religious inferences.Then we looked at references to utopias in our mythologies. There are, in fact, many instances of utopian references. There was one reference to this ideal community called uttarakur. The other idea that came to my mind was the whole chakravyuha. We all go through a chakravyuhaevery individual goes through this manoeuvring of lifes passageways, ultimately to emerge into enlightenment or liberation. Therefore, along with the designers, we thought the chakravyuha would be a good manifestation of this installation. We eventually settled on Chakraview as the title. And then we interpret the seven chakras in our utopian view of India.You chose to stay away from religion or politics in your interpretation of an Indian utopia. This is an interesting approach. Do you think both of those thingsreligion and politicsstand between many Indians and the utopian life they desire? I think politics and religion play a role in any nations existence. You cannot remove the importance of politics and religion.One unique aspect of Chakraview is that it is one of the few exhibits here that are orderly and have a certain spatial symmetry. Does this reflect the fact that one common aspect of every Indians personal utopia is orderliness and symmetry? Is that the thread that binds all these visions? A harking for order?Symmetry is very important because it brings a certain order to disorderliness. It requires a certain discipline. I think in all the noise and colour of the exhibit, there is an order. There is also an element of government policymaking and collaboration in the exhibit. There is a video that connects the history of Indian design to the future of Indian policymaking.Why not? This is also a country-branding exercise. All such biennales are an opportunity to highlight what a country has to offer to the design world. It took a lot of work to get the government to endorse it. Because governments are used to trade fairs. They are used to exhibitions. They are used to conferences. Not design biennales.They want to sign MoUs (memorandums of understanding) at the end of something like this presumably?They didnt understand biennales. Im very happy that weve broken that constraint. We have put India on that map. It is about tourism, it is about textiles, it is about manufacturing, it is about everything else and this is quintessential India. We are a progressing country, and we have our own utopias. That is a challenge to show off. But this is all part of a broader plan you have for Indian design, especially as part of the India Design Forum.The larger agenda is to really create or design infrastructure which is both policy driven and private sector driven that will enable young designers. We have an NID (National Institute of Design) and a few other private design schools. Is that sufficient for a country the size of India? Absolutely not. I want to help designers to actually create businesses and add value to the businesses, allow them to market themselves and be Indian global designers as well. Today all your automotive companies have their design studios out of India. This has to change.What is holding us back from becoming a global design powerhouse?The problem is the mindset. We have to stop saying we are a poor country, we are a poor country. We have our multiple utopias because multiple problems exist, but you have to handle them at the same time. You cannot reduce everything to the common denominator of poverty. Once you reduce everything to a single metric then we start thinking: This is not better or that is not well, this is not important that is not important. Everything is important. We have killed the creative legacy of India by reducing everything to good or bad.Is that because of this tremendous utilitarianism that we have?Utilitarianism is fine, but design and innovation are part of utilitarianism. How can you design a pen, how can you design anything without thinking about its utility? There is a central philosophy: we must do more with less. We are obsessed with this. Why not do more with more? Instead we design products that do their job in the most basic ways possible. We dont care how many people will use it, we dont care about the different people who use a product, we dont care about ease of use. But we should. Unfortunately design is seen as being a superfluous. Design is art and therefore unessential. But that is totally wrong. Design is all about making functional products.Is that the problem. That we dont see the difference between those two things? Design and art?No, we dont see the difference. Even journalists dont understand it. Im forever asked this question. What is the definition of art and design? And then there are people who think that good design is all about handbags and shoes.Im passionate about it. We have lost our creative legacy which is why despite all the big, huge Indian conglomerates that are in IT, we will never produce a Steve Jobs. Because we only do jobwork. We have to learn to create.How do you stop that? How do you intervene? What intervention do you need?You need a change in the mindset. You need a government that thinks that creativity is important. That it is innovation and design that transforms cities into liveable harmonious spaces. You have to have more design schools. You have to have design thinking. You have to have design in your vocabulary in government. But we think good design is elitist. Because it is art. And we think art is elitist. While the procurement of art may be elitist, the people who make art are not elitist. Art itself is not elitist. We need to drill this into people starting from the government and downwards.",2016-09-23,AaHEkZsUBTt2iDpOuGaF6L,"Rajshree Sugars and Chemicals CMD Rajshree Pathy on growth of the India Design Forum, which she founded, and how to establish design thinking in India",competitor,23:47,Why cant we do more with more in India?: Rajshree Pathy
0.48,"With the addition of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Code, the Indian lending system has gotten teeth in dealing with stressed borrowers and a difficult macroeconomic situation. As the Indian banking system stares at a Rs6.3 trillion bad loan pile, with more being added almost every quarter, a legal stress resolution mechanism is the need of the hour.
				   
				As some of the finer points of the Code get clarified, before it takes effect at the end of the year, there is speculation around how it will be implemented in a market like India, which is famously known for its slow resolution rate.At a panel discussion at the Mint conference on Bankruptcy ActImpact of the new law on the banking landscape, held on 24 October, industry professionals, law professionals and stressed asset consultants came together to discuss the Code, and the opportunities and challenges associated with it. As divorce is important for marriage, I think insolvency resolution is important for investments, whether Indian or foreign capital, said Cyril Suresh Shroff, managing partner at Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas. According to Shroff, the impact of the bankruptcy code will be widely positive, leading to a better management of stressed companies in India. M.R. Umarji, a member of the Bankruptcy Law Committee set up by government, believes that while the code bestows significant powers on the legal system to deal with stressed companies, the intended effect is that there will be better financial discipline among companies, which will work to ensure that all their creditors are paid on time. Abizer Diwanji, partner and national leader, financial services and restructuring services, EY India, said, About 70% of our banking business is government-led. They have restraints in the way that they can make rational decisions in a timely manner. The law says that in 270 days there has to be a decision or the company goes into liquidation, but that does not mean that in 270 days there will be a rational decision.Rashesh Shah, chairman and chief executive officer at Edelweiss Finance, is of the view that the lending system in India has entered into yet another zone of conflict between the lenders and the borrowers. According to him, back in the late 80s and early 90s, when infrastructure lenders were faced with high non-performing assets (NPAs), they would convert a significant chunk of their debt into equity and then make huge returns a few years later. Back then, the lenders won the tug of war.In the era of corporate debt restructuring (CDR) and other debt recast mechanisms, lenders have ended up taking haircuts while the equity holders didnt feel much of the pinch. Shah believes that the equity holders or the borrowers had won that round. With the bankruptcy code coming into the picture, the powers have once again come into the hands of lenders as they are far above equity holders in the payout structure that the code mandates in a liquidation situation, said Shah.The bark is more important than the bite. As a practitioner I would never like to get into a situation of resolution under this Act, but I think it is desirable that we would be outside this or before this is invoked, said Vishakha Mulye, executive director, ICICI Bank.As a system, Mulye said, everyone must work together to demonstrate that resolution and liquidation can be done in an effective and efficient manner, if there has to be a future for the bankruptcy code. However, not everyone is convinced that India has done enough to move the stressed asset situation in the right direction.Anurag Das, founder and managing partner at Rain Tree Capital Singapore, is measured in his optimism. Some of the best practices around the world need to come to this market too, he said, adding that a very hands-on approach has to be taken to ensure that a turnaround takes place.According to Das, even though his optimism is measured, the expectation is that in about five years from now, there will be a number of Indian stressed companies where turnaround will take place because of the code.Some flaws in the way that the code is drafted include the fact that lenders too are held at gunpoint in case the resolution plan does not get finalised in the time assigned by the code, according to Rajendra Chitale, managing partner, MP Chitale & Associates.There should be a provision to get extensions if needed, Chitale said, adding that these flaws might have been unintended, but are part of the way bankruptcy play out in the future. Another issue, Chitale points out, is that the law assumes that the resolution plan that is being implemented in the stressed company will work out in the first attempt.  This may lead to an increase in the number of credible assets in the economy which may go into wind-up. Having said that, Chitale believes that the bankruptcy code is a landmark legislation which can change the way business is done in India.",2016-11-02,Ab3yPyjl9xhcHsOJtF2GeK,"At the Mint conference on the Bankruptcy Act, industry professionals, law professionals and stressed asset consultants discuss opportunities and challenges",company,00:51,Measuring the impact of the Bankruptcy Act

				Winning developers in Jharkhand state are still waiting to sign power purchase agreements almost a year after the tender. In March, Jharkhand awarded contracts to build 1.2 gigawatts (GW) of solar. The states power retailer, Jharkhand Bijli Vitran Nigam Ltd, was supposed to sign the power purchase agreements in May 2016.We have asked for financial assistance of a few hundred crore rupees from the states finance department and are awaiting their response, said R.K. Srivastava, chief secretary of the energy department in the state of Jharkhand.The delay underscores the threat from financially strapped state power retailers to Prime Minister Narendra Modis ambitious renewable energy goals. State-owned power retailers in India had combined losses of Rs3.84 trillion as of March 2015, according to a report by KPMG.Jharkhand Bijlis managing director, Rahul Kumar Purwar, couldnt be reached for comment.ReNew Power Ventures Pvt. Ltd, which is majority owned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. scooped up 522 MW in the March auction. ReNews other investors include the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the Global Environment Fund.Other winners included Suzlon Energy Ltd, OPG Power Ventures Plc, Acme Group, Adani Enterprises Ltd and SunEdison Inc.A Suzlon spokesperson was unavailable for comment. An email sent to the Adani Group wasnt returned. OPG Power executives couldnt be reached. In an email, ReNew Power executives declined to comment.Solar auctionHow much of the solar capacity awarded in Marchs tender eventually gets built depends on whether the government provides the backing, Srivastava said.Tariffs awarded in the auction ranged from Rs5.08 to Rs7.90 per kilowatt-hour depending on the size of the project, all of which were supposed to become operational between May and November this year.There is a huge difference between the average tariff of nearly Rs4.3 a unit, at which the discom buys power, and the rates quoted for solar energy in the auction last year, Srivastava said in a phone interview, referring to the term used to identify electricity distribution companies in India.The poor financial health of the countrys power retailers has been identified as one of the biggest hurdles to Modis climate pledge to install 175 GW of renewable capacity by 2022.Those losses mean discoms cant buy more electricity to satisfy expected demand whether clean or conventional, nor can they add more customers. That ultimately leaves latent power demand unmet.Several domestic and overseas clean energy companies have said they havent received payments for the electricity they generate for more than 10 months, racking up deficits of several hundred million dollars that may put the countrys green power ambitions at risk.Jharkhands state discom has liabilities of Rs6,400 crore, according to government data.

				That query posed by Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev at the Isha Foundations annual leadership workshop for entrepreneurs resonated with many attendees, including Deepak Satwalekar, the former managing director and chief executive officer of HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. Ltd.It makes you think and reflect on what your priorities should be. Dont go around trying to fix the world. Fix yourself first, and the rest will follow, said Satwalekar, who has been a resource leader at the annual event since it first started five years ago with the aim of helping small businesses scale up.This year, INSIGHT: The DNA of Success programme, led by Sadhguru, will take place from 24 to 27 November and will feature State Bank of India chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya, Piramal Group and Shriram Group Chairman Ajay Piramal, former Kellogg and INSEAD dean Dipak Jain, former Britannia Industries Ltd MD Vinita Bali, TeamIndus fleet commander Rahul Narayan, Shoppers Stop Ltd non-executive vice-chairman B.S. Nagesh, and textiles minister Smriti Zubin Irani. Mint is a partner of the programme.So what draws so many corporate leaders, academics and entrepreneurs to the event held every year at the Coimbatore headquarters of Sadhgurus Isha Foundation?You will learn several things that you were not taught in management school or at work, and get a chance to be inspired by Sadhguru, said Shanker Annaswamy, the former MD of IBM India Pvt. Ltd.For instance, the workshop helped Sapan Jain summon the courage to leave his corporate job at International Business Machines Corp. and start reverse logistics service provider Blubirch, and alter his entire approach towards problem-solving. It taught him to focus on the variables he could control rather than obsessing over the potential consequences of a situation, ranging from the departure of a key employee to a promised investment falling through.All of us read business books. All of us hear business leaders. Sometimes, (all of that) beyond a point can get vegetative and monotonous. When you hear a different perspective which is still very pragmatic and practical (such as Sadhgurus), it makes a lot of sense, Jain said.Vikash Agrawal, the promoter of power plant equipment maker Hi-Tech Systems & Services Ltd. (HTSSL), agreed.The insights he gleaned there have become a kind of another management book for me, said Agrawal, who is planning to attend the event yet again this year.Agarwal has made sure to implement some of the business lessons he learned at the event, including the fail early concept and the 90-day rule proposed by BRICS Bank chief K.V. Kamath in a bid to set a limit on the time a company should pilot a new idea before moving on.This is exactly why management gurus such as Ram Charan recommend the workshop.The single most reason (that makes this workshop unique) is that the learning is done from the practitioners, Charan said.The resource leaders, who act as informal mentors to entrepreneurs at the event, come from diverse backgrounds and sectors, making it almost a certainty that a participant will find someone he or she will be able to relate with personally and professionally, former attendees said.Also, unlike years past, this years event will include more structured modules on specific topics and include more women and people from the manufacturing, said programme facilitator Nagesh.For Nagesh, the biggest challenge is to make the workshop equally appealing to somebody whose companys sales are Rs10 crore and another who runs a Rs1,000 crore firm. That said, he believes the programme is fairly unique because of the fact that the spiritual part is actually integrated into it. The events faculty chair, Dipak Jain, too has been fascinated by Sadhgurus focus on inner engineering.First you have to be a better person before you start a better business or a better society, Jain said.The programme has proved to be an eye opener for not just the entrepreneurs but also for those who have been past speakers or mentors.Everyone has their own struggle and sometimes understanding how others dealt with their own challenges, can give us the inspiration to move forward, said Dr. Reddys Laboratories Ltd co-chairman and CEO G.V. Prasad.Prasad encouraged entrepreneurs to practise a mantra he learned from Sadhguru that those who want to scale up must learn to let go of their current state without fear and move to a higher plane, akin to trapeze artists, while Satwalekar urged them to stay hungry for knowledge, learn to prioritise, surround themselves with smarter people and not be afraid of failure.For many, like Varda Shine, the former CEO of De Beers Diamond Trading Co, the main draw of the program is Sadhguru, whose way of looking at leadership and success is much wider than any other business learning.And former participants across the board have a simple piece of advice for anyone looking to attend the event this year.As Anupal Banerjee, senior vice president  human resources, Viacom18 Media Pvt.

An email sent to the Edelweiss spokesperson on Tuesday did not elicit any response.In one of the largest buyouts in the multiplex business, Carnival acquired Big Cinemas, a division of Anil Ambanis Reliance MediaWorks Ltd, for around Rs700 crore in December 2014.Carnival, which bought 252 screens of Big Cinemas, had added 30 screens with the acquisition of HDIL Broadway for Rs110 crore in January 2014. In 2015, Carnival made its third acquisition by buying out Stargaze Entertainment Pvt. Ltd from a unit of Mukesh Ambani-controlled Network18 Media and Investments Ltd for an undisclosed amount, giving it 30 additional screens.The company had drawn up aggressive plans to add more screens and also refurbish the existing ones.

In September 2015, Carnival acquired the commercial real estate projects of Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) in Chandigarh, including Elante Mall, Hyatt Hotel and office premises for Rs1,785 crore.Carnival Group also bought Leela Infopark at Technopark in Thiruvananthapuram for Rs142 crore last year. In a similar deal, Carnival Group had taken over the IT infrastructure of Leela Group in Kochi in July 2014 for Rs280 crore.Structured debt transactions have become common in India, with a number of domestic and foreign institutions and private equity firms disbursing debt finance.Groups such as GMR Holdings Pvt.

Within this business, the so-called direct mature business segment has also witnessed a drop in growth rates.Considering that this is the main growth engine for the company, the sharp deceleration is clearly worrying.Analysts at Nomura Research said in a note to clients, We see risks to our estimates which build in ~13% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) over FY16-18F in this business.The silver lining in the results was that business from HPE rose 1.9% sequentially in dollar terms last quarter, compared with a 4.2% decline in the June quarter.The companys post-results commentary suggests the HP business has bottomed out and that it expects moderate growth from this segment in the coming quarters.But, clearly, no ones expecting this segment to drive growth.Unless the direct international business shows signs of a recovery, investors would start questioning the outperformance Mphasis shares have enjoyed this year.",2016-11-09,AuUbc7Nw16dZoFxQQ32mFI,"Mphasis revenues declined 5.3% year-on-year (y-o-y) in dollar terms to $224.1 million, faring worse than the June quarter, when revenues had declined by 4.1%",competitor,00:49,Mphasis continues to struggle for growth

At first, the dealership wouldnt sell the vehicles. We had to clarify that it would be used for private use and not for commercial purposes, he said. Once they did, it was put on a container and shipped across to the Bay Area, We had no idea what we were hoping really. We thought we would get it and then figure it out.Once the auto reached the port, another problem arose. No one knew what it was. So, it had to be certified. The paperwork took us nearly 2-3 months.

-0.37,"Bhaskar Pramanik, chairman of Microsoft Corp. (India) Pvt. Ltd, steered marketing, operations, and business development efforts of the worlds largest software company in India for the last five years. Even as Anant Maheshwari handles the sales, marketing and services operations of Microsoft in India from 1 January, Pramanik, who also led Microsofts interactions with policy makers, customers, and business partners, continues as chairman until 31 March. In an interview, he outlined the companys strategy and vision for digital transformation. Edited excerpts:
Digital transformation is todays buzzword. How has it impacted Microsofts strategy?Our mission is to empower individuals and organizations to achieve more. If you notice, we dont talk about technology in our mission statement. The reason is that while technology will continuously keep evolving, our mission will remain the same. This is also based on our three primary ambitions, which I refer to as platforms, and which we believe we are the best at.The first is personal computing. It is not just about a personal computer. It is about the mobility of the experience, the Internet of Things (IoT), it is about augmented and virtual reality. Its the way you access computing through touch, make it accessible in multiple different languages, and enable even differently-abled people to interact with computing because computing has become all pervasive. Computing will come in different shapes and sizes. This is already happening. Today, most people have multiple IP (internet protocol) addresses in the more connected parts of the world. This is core for strategy. The second is about productivity and business processes. It is not just about productivity of the individual but productivity of groups, of enterprises, of an entire industry. Consider what we created for eyecare with L V Prasad Eye Institute the story that is called the Connected Eye. We set up a consortium called MINEMicrosoft Intelligent Network for Eyesso that all the different segments of the eyecare industry can get the benefit of sharing anonymous patient data to do far better patient care. So people may think us as an Office company but we are helping doctors do much more with analytics.The third is the Intelligent Cloud, which enables the first two platforms. This is the intelligence that Satya (Nadella) recently talked about. The fourth industrial revolution is all about data, and data is what makes artificial intelligence possible. You can use the humongous data to predict, for compliance purposes and that is why the cloud is not just a storehouse for data but a way by which you can mine this data to solve different problems and challenges that the world faces.What does this approach mean to your customers?Whether our customer is the government, education or SMBs (small and medium-sized businesses), it is all about how we can help our customers empower their employees; how we can help them to engage with their customers differently; how can we help them to optimize their business and transform their business.Transformation is about business model changing. So if you have a connected product or service, your whole business model changes because you dont charge for the productyou charge for the service. Second is about differentiated customer experiences. We have transformed the way people buy. Analytics is now built into everything we do because that gives you the power of datathe ability to actually take better informed decisions. Finally, it is about using IoT to make processes, products intelligent.This did require a cultural changeAll this would not have been possible if we hadnt changed the culture of the company. I strongly believe that culture is as strong as strategy. And that is true for Microsoft. Our ability to have moved so quickly is because of the change weve made in our culture, led by what Satya has been doing (see box: Nadella in the drivers seat). The culture is based on a fundamental belief which we call a growth mindset. Every individual has the opportunity to learn from his mistakes, learn continuously and develop himself.Microsoft emphasizes diversity and inclusion. Could you elaborate?We have learnt that it is the diversity of ideas which is very critical for any culture that has a growth mindset. Ideas can come from any part of the organization, any gender, from very young peoplethis is critical to becoming an inclusive organization. And being an MNC, we have the ability to sell across geographies and segments. Next, we have very strong technical people but they typically work in silos. We have very large teams in these areas here (in India) so we can build solutions that can be extended to the developed world or even create solutions for the developed parts (like banks and financial institutions) of India and be exported to the Western world. This is how we look at One Microsoft. This is the message we give our partners and customers.",2017-01-05,B1BNWqoulb7ZRthL1mW94M,Microsoft India chairman Bhaskar Pramanik on the companys strategy and vision for digital transformation,competitor,02:05,"Analytics is now built into everything we do, says Microsoft India chairman"
0.76,"Eicher Motors Ltds strong growth in the March quarter failed to impress investors. The stock lost steam after the company released its earnings on Thursday and closed with a marginal loss, compared with a small gain for the Nifty index.
				   
				Revenue at the consolidated level increased 46.6% from a year ago, slower than the 50%-plus growth the Street was forecasting. The miss is largely due to the commercial vehicles (CVs) divisionVE Commercial Vehicles Ltd (VECV). The business continues to see high discounts, Siddhartha Lal, Eicher Motors managing director and chief executive officer said. Add to this an unfavourable product mix and realizations fell from both the year ago and on a sequential basis, Religare Capital Markets Ltds calculations show.The silver lining is the division had one of the best quarters in recent years. Volumes are up 41% and the business gained market share in buses and medium, light and heavy duty trucks. The strong volumes led to the belief that realizations and economies of scale will see significant improvement. But contrarily, Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin at the CV division is estimated to have risen by less than a percentage point to 8%, pointing to competitive pressures. Three brokerage firms had forecast the divisions margins to expand in the range of 1.4-2.9 percentage points.The motorcycle business on the other hand lived up to expectations. Revenues at the stand-alone level jumped 60.7% on an almost similar rise in volumes. Margins expanded 3.8 percentage points to 29.9%. This helped expand consolidated margin to 17%, driving up Ebitda and net profit by 75% and 71%, respectively.Investors will do well to prepare for growth moderation in the motorcycle business. From around five months in early 2015, the waiting period for the companys popular selling model has reduced to three months now. But then, the reduction is partly explained by increased production. A production plan of 675,000 units in 2016-17 translates to a growth of 33% (based on previous year sales). Sales in 2015-16 were up 53%. The company is giving a strong push to two new modelsContinental GT and Himalayan. But the models are yet to take off in a big way. That raises question about valuations, which at 30 times the current fiscal year earnings estimate is the most expensive automobile stock to own.To be sure, Eicher continues to expand its addressable market. It plans to ramp up its Himalayan model in coming months and improve its international reach. While the results of these initiatives will be seen in coming quarters, a slowdown in the motorcycle business, the key earnings driver for Eicher, can put pressure on the stock valuations, unless the CV business measures up on profitability.",2016-05-06,B3CYkneggBmWajZyEfVTnK,"A slowdown in the Royal Enfield business can put pressure on the stock valuations, unless the CV business measures up on profitability

Raman said that funds from USL were diverted to some group companies of United Breweries Ltd, including the now defunct  Kingfisher Airlines Ltd.Investors (of USL) might have based their investment decisions on the manipulated books of accounts prepared and presented by these persons, said Sebi.The capital market watchdogs order comes at a time when the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has charged Mallya with fraud and criminal conspiracy in connection with the grounded airlines unpaid loans of over Rs950 crore that it owed to IDBI Bank.Sebi considered two forensic audits conducted by PwC and EY  for transactions between 2010-2014.While the audit by PwC observed that Rs 655 crore was diverted and misappropriated, EY found that Rs 1,225 crore was mis-utilised.ALSO READ | Vijay Mallya case: CBI seeks judicial custody of ex-IDBI chairman, othersThe diverted amounts were included as provisions in the financial statements, according to the Sebi order.Certain transactions were conducted in a manner that violated provisions of Companies Act, 1956, and listing agreement, said Sebi.The regulator observed that Mallya exerted pressure on USL employees to arrange funds for Kingfisher Airlines.When officials of USL protested that it would impact the companies books, Mallya wrote to them saying that refusal to sanction these funds would have consequences. I know the USL position exactly. It is my final call. If you cannot accept my instructions, you are free to decide your further steps.... but let me repeat, my call is final and an instruction, the Sebi order quoted Mallya as as saying in an email to employees.Mallya stepped down from USL in February 2016 after striking a sweetheart deal with Diageo Plc, which now controls the Indian liquor maker.

0.0,"Taipei: Toshiba Corp. is in trouble. Again.
				   
				This time a kerfuffle at its Westinghouse Electric Co. nuclear-power division is forcing the Japanese industrial conglomerate to spin off its memory-chip businesses, prepping the unit for a sale of a minority stake.So far, the talk is that such a sale will amount to only 20% of the businessenough to raise some cash, but not so much as to give up control. Toshiba wants to keep its chip cake and eat it, too.A minority purchase alone doesnt hold much strategic value for an investor, as theyd ride the roller-coaster of a highly unstable memory-chip industry, yet without enough control to affect change or combine operations.Doubtless theres enough private-equity money out there to find someone willing to roll the dice. And of course existing strategic partner Western Digital Corp. would also be an obvious choice. A WD investment may face antitrust concerns, however, so such a deal isnt assured, Bloomberg News reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.Chinese investors, though, wont face any antitrust concerns and likely have a far bigger appetite for accepting instability as the price for getting a seat at the table. Lack of strategic access wouldnt be ideal, but this could be seen as a first entree into the market.Then theres politics. Theres a case to be made that a Chinese investment in a non-US company would sail through political opposition more easily than other tie-ups, given the role the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS) plays in scuttling deals. If a hungry Chinese investor buys into that thesis, then theyre likely to seize on the rare opportunity to get access to a major name in semiconductors. For Toshiba, knowing such investors are out there should embolden its executives to seek a higher price from any bidders. This may be a fire sale, but that doesnt mean Toshiba needs to accept low-ball offers.

0.9,"Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is likely to report an increase in its quarterly profit, as stronger petrochemical margins offset weaker earnings from its refining business. 
				   
				Consolidated net profit is likely to increase to Rs7,282.5 crore on a revenue of Rs63,669.9 crore for the three months ended on 30 September, according to a Bloomberg poll of six analysts. In the year-earlier quarter, the company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs6,720 crore and revenue of Rs75,117 crore. RIL will announce its second-quarter earnings on Thursday. After six consecutive sequential earnings increases, we expect RILs standalone earnings to moderate 2% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), mainly due to weaker refining. But, RIL may surprise again. We expect another record petchem EBIT, said Nomura Research in a 7 October note to clients. Ebit stands for earnings before interest and taxes and is an indication of a companys profitability. RILs refining and marketing business, which accounts for over 75% of revenue and more than 60% of profit, could be hurt due to lower refining margins.Analysts expect RILs gross refining margin (GRM) to be $9.5-10 per barrel. GRM is the realization from turning every barrel of crude oil into finished products. We estimate GRM to be down 10% QoQ (quarter on quarter) while throughput 7% higher QoQ following a restart of special economic zone crude distillation unit after 20 days maintenance shutdown in May 2016. Refining EBITDA will therefore fall 6% QoQ, said Edelweiss Research in a 5 October report. During the September quarter, Singapore GRM averaged at $5.1 per barrel compared with $5 in the preceding three months.We expect RIL to report a $10 GRM versus $11.5 in 1Q, the latter including $2 of hedging & inventory gains, said Citi Research in its report dated 4 October. Earnings from the petrochemicals segment, however, are expected to rise on higher volume and wider margins. We expect petchem earnings to show strong growth led by higher volumes (some expansion projects are gradually reflecting in earnings) and improved spreads in the polymer chain, said IDFC Securities in a report dated 5 October. On the exploration and production (E&P) front, which includes domestic assets and US shale gas assets, the second quarter could also be a loss-making one for RIL as crude oil and domestic gas prices are lower compared to last year. Production from the KG block is also expected to be lower. RIL is likely to report losses in a small EBIT profit on domestic E&P. US shale will continue to remain loss-making. Crude oil and domestic gas prices are lower year-on-year. KG D6 production is expected to be down 3% year-on-year, said Bank of America Merrill Lynch in a report dated 10 October. Though RIL launched its telecom services on 5 September, the numbers are not likely to be included in September quarter. We do not expect the company to account for Jio in its consolidated results despite its launch in September as it is currently being offered to customers for free. The company reported 16 million subscribers at the end of September but without customers being charged, genuine momentum is difficult to gauge in our view, said Jefferies Equity Research in its report dated 10 October. RIL shares rose 0.7% to Rs1,086.90 on BSE; the benchmark Sensex shed 0.24% to 27,984.37 points.",2016-10-20,BF1XPFCd3H7nUUY8lvORTJ,"Reliance Industries consolidated net profit is likely to increase to Rs7,282.5 crore on a revenue of Rs63,669.9 crore for the three months ended 30 September",both,00:44,RIL Q2 profit to ride on petchem margins
-0.25,"Dallas: Clear, the biometric screening firm long hobbled by a limited network, is landing in several major US airports soon, including New Yorks LaGuardia, marking the start of an era that could radically accelerate your trip from curb to cabin. But there are some bumps to smooth out first.
				   
				Clear, which started at JFK International Airport earlier this month, will open screening lanes at LaGuardia and Atlantas Hartsfield-Jackson in the next few days, followed by Los Angeles International and Minneapolis-St. Paul by April. All told, the expansion will put Clear at 22 major airports, covering the majority of domestic American flights, according to the company.Clear doesnt replace TSA PreCheck so much as complement it. It checks travellers identities with a fingerprint or iris scan, eliminating the boarding pass and identity checks. That lets Clear members proceed directly to bag and body screening. The company says about 65% of its users at the busiest airports have also enrolled in PreCheck, allowing them to retain their shoes, belts, and laptops during the screening.Clear is a reincarnation of the verified-identification idea begun by journalist Steven Brill in 2003. That company ran out of money and shut down in 2009. It was purchased in bankruptcy the following year for about $6 million by investors including Clears current CEO, former hedge fund manager Caryn Seidman-Becker. Other stakeholders include T. Rowe Price Group Inc., Sterling Equities, investor Bill Miller, and former executives of Priceline Group Inc. (Clear also offers security checks at various professional sports arenas.)The New York-based company, in which Delta Air Lines Inc. holds a 5% stake, has been working hard to expand its network to the point where veteran air travelers would view it as comprehensive. Glaring omissions at some major hubs, such as Chicago OHare and Newark Liberty, have made some frequent fliers disinclined to consider paying for the service. In order to provide the best service and to meet the expectations of our members, we have to be in all the right airports, said David Cohen, Clears chief administrative officer. Thats really important. There are other obstacles still facing Clear. Its lanes, for one, arent always located in the same terminals that have the bulk of an airports traffic.At both Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston-Bush airports, for example, Clears lanes are in terminals not used by the dominant carriers at those hubs, American Airlines Group Inc. and United Continental Holdings Inc., respectively. Cohen said each airport has different needs and requirements about where Clear can establish screening.Clear charges $179 annually, with new enrollees receiving a one-month trial for free. The company has also experimented with a variety of pricing promotions, such as $29 for a three-month enrolment last summer. Members of Deltas SkyMiles frequent flier program get discounted memberships, while Delta covers the cost for its top-level elite members. Clear members can add a spouse or domestic partner for $50, and children 17 and younger are free.Clear says it has more than 700,000 members nationwide and will surpass 1 million in the next few months, with annual enrollment growth of 110%.If Clear reaches critical mass and becomes a viable option for all who wish to enroll, it may face a bigger problem: success. More travelers using Clear may spell longer queues at airports that already face space constraints. Isnt Clear useful to its customers precisely because its audience is limited? Cohen said the company hasnt yet faced this problem, even as it processes upwards of 2,000 travelers each day at its busiest locations. And the tech firm has an advantage when it comes to that issue, he said: By using technology like automated kiosks, it can expand without hiring more employees.

-0.24,"Seoul: Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd said Friday that the discontinuation of the Galaxy Note 7 would cost the company about $3 billion during the current and next quarters, bringing the total cost of the recall to at least $5.3 billion.
				   
				The Note 7 discontinuation will cost in the mid-2 trillion won range during the October-December period and another 1 trillion won ($884 million) during the January-March quarter, the company said in a statement.Samsung already slashed its third-quarter profit forecast by $2.6 billion earlier this week, an amount that could wipe out its entire mobile business profit. That did not include the cost of Samsungs first recall, which analysts estimated at 1 trillion won to 2 trillion won.Samsung has enough cash and other businesses to absorb the shock from the phone recall. It said it expected to generate 5.2 trillion won ($4.6 billion) in operating income during the third quarter after the recall cost. Analysts said most of the income will be generated by sales of advanced displays and semiconductors.Samsung added that it will make significant changes in its quality assurance processes to enhance product safety for consumers. It did not elaborate.The company said it will expand sales of two other smartphones released in spring, the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge, quashing rumors that it may try to release updated versions of those devices. Samsung usually releases a new iteration of the Galaxy S series in spring, so the company may have to provide a strong incentive to sell the 6-month-old phones, such as lowering their prices.Due to unexplained fires and overheating problems, more than 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 smartphones were recalled before the product was discontinued earlier this week just two months after its launch in August.In the United States, 1.9 million Note 7 phones are subject to the two recalls. Samsung also recalled about 200,000 phones in China and about half a million phones in South Korea.The US Consumer Product Safety Commission said there were 96 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the country, including 23 new reports since the first recall announcement last month. The company received 13 reports of burns and 47 reports of property damages associated with the phones.Consumers should immediately stop using and power down all Galaxy Note 7 devices, including Note 7 devices received as replacements in the previous recall, the agency said.The botched recall raised questions about Samsungs initial analysis of the Note 7 phones problems. At first, Samsung said a minor manufacturing error in the batteries for the Note 7 was causing the phones to overheat.The problem with the replacements is still unclear. Experts say Samsung may have rushed to conclude the Note 7s problem was a battery issue and it may take a long time to find the real cause.Seeking to retain customers, Samsung is giving an incentive of a $100 credit to Note 7 owners who switch to another Samsung phone.The Note 7 device was one of the most expensive smartphones in the market with all the latest technologies from Samsung, including the ability to unlock the phone by scanning a users iris. It was sold for between $850 and $890.

Its also a company recognized for its marketing smarts and engineering savvy worldwide, so much so that consulting firm Interbrand ranked it as the worlds seventh most valuable in its 2016 survey, ahead of Amazon and Mercedes-Benz.
				   
				So how is it that the pride of South Korea has so botched the recall of 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 smartphones after complaints of exploding batteries  and a ton of negative publicity by the media in the US, Europe and China, not to mention the vast echo chamber of social media?When it recalled its phones last month, it assured consumers it had diagnosed the problem and that its replacements were safe. Not so it turns out: Customers reported the lithium batteries in new phones went up in flames too, in some instances. On Tuesday, Samsung took the dramatic step of killing off the Note 7 for good.This is a calamity, said Srinivas Reddy, director at the Center for Marketing Excellence at Singapore Management University. The threat for Samsung is how soon they can get back. If they dont get back soon, it provides a vacuum for others to creep in.The company has not said how many new or replacement phones will be affected. Analysts estimated that the original recall would cost between $1 billion and $2 billion, but that figure will now certainly rise.The move sent Samsung shares down 8% on Tuesday, vaporizing $17 billion in market value. Samsungs sterling brand image built up over decades is at risk unless the management team led by vice chairman Jay Y. Lee, 48, doesnt get out in front of the crisis soon.Its a very critical moment for Samsung, said Martin Roll, a brand strategist and author of Asian Brand Strategy. How Samsung is handling this crisis is kind of a way for Samsung to step into the modern era because Asian firms have only started to emerge as very iconic, contemporary consumer brands like Apple. The history of Samsung as a brand is still being written. Also Read: Samsung to kill off Galaxy Note 7 after second round of battery firesSome six weeks after the first reports of exploding phones surfaced, Samsung engineers, as well as US and South Korean government investigators, have yet to discover why lithium batteries in the companys new smartphone product overheat and in some cases explode.The Korean Agency for Technology and Standards (KATS) said in an e-mailed statement on Tuesday, it is investigating the possibility the Note 7 smartphones may have a new defect. An official at the ministry of trade, industry and energy didnt rule out the possibility that the problem may be tied to the overall product design or production. Samsung has said its working with investigators and still trying to identify the source of the battery problem.Whether the Samsung brand takes a lasting hit will depend, in part, on how long the mystery of the Note 7 batteries continues and whether the company is perceived by consumers as stonewalling.Samsung must come clean with a thorough explanation as the previous explanations dont completely add up now, said Mark Newman, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein in Hong Kong.The company needs to find out the exact cause and communicate it clearly to consumers, according to Yoo Jong Woo, an analyst at Korean Investment & Securities Co. I think the company will be able to recover from the blow to its image over time, if the problem does not spread to other phones, he said.Brand strategist Roll agreed that consumers will be forgiving if this is viewed as an aberration at an otherwise reliable company. Consumers need to be kept in the loop here because theyve put trust in Samsungs brand, Roll said. Its a partnership.Until Samsung can come up with some answers, it faces thorny challenges. Six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had originally estimates that Samsung would ship 13 million Note 7s this year. Now it has a hole in its product lineup, just as Apple begins selling its iPhone 7 and high-end devices from Google hit the market.Theres also the risk that the Note 7 troubles spill over to other smartphones in the Galaxy lineup, dampening overall sales momentum against key rivals such as Apple and Huawei Technologies Co. Samsung faces a serious image problem in China, where customers and government-owned media have railed about Samsungs handling of its recall.Theyre done in China, said Shaun Rein, managing director of Shanghai-based China Market Research Group. For the Chinese, they dont differentiate between the Note 7 and all Samsung phones. So theyre not willing to buy any Samsung phones right now.Also Read: What to do with a Galaxy Note 7, now you know it might explodeBack in South Korea, some consumers are more forgiving. Several customers shopping at a smartphone retail store in Seouls Jonggak neighbourhood shrugged off suggestions the latest crisis could hurt Samsungs image. They said they would still consider Samsung phone as an option despite reports of Note 7 catching on fire. One customer said it was a matter of national pride. As a South Korean we should purchase Samsung phones because we should think about the country, said Shin Young-su, 50, who is self-employed. He said he was encouraging more young Koreans to buy Samsung phones to help the company.Another customer who prefers Apples iPhone because of functionality with his other Apple devices said he didnt think the latest crisis would hurt the Samsung brand. The igniting issue is a problem for only few phones, Kim Sung-min, 38, who would only say he works in the service industry. Even if a phone ignites in my hands, I believe Samsung will take care of everything for me. I believe in the brand.Samsung will almost certainly take a meaningful financial hit in the fourth quarter from the Note 7, according to Bernsteins Newman. That said, he estimates the entire Note line only accounts for 8.5% of his 2017 net profit forecast and thinks Tuesdays market reaction was overdone.Dan Baker, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Hong Kong, pegs the direct cost from the initial Note 7 recall at as much as 1 trillion won ($892 million). But the damage to reputation and future sales is probably going to be bigger, he said. Its not just the phone: their whole ecosystem is behind this  displays, memory chips. If their phone sales drop, then their sales of other parts of the business will be impacted. Its a spiral.Baker expects Samsung to try to shift the focus to the next version of the smartphone. Theyre probably going to double the testing on it, he said. They dont want this to happen again. There will be peoples jobs on the line. Bloomberg",2016-10-11,BMMCg1Ra1XmGkDdh9qFxII,"The threat for Samsung is how soon they can get back after Note 7  issue .

-1.0,"Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan is an assistant professor in the department of computer science and engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay. He specialises in artificial intelligence (AI) and is the only author from India who is part of an 18-member study panel of the Stanford University-hosted report titled Artificial Intelligence and Life. Kalyanakrishnans expertise broadly fits in the area of machine learning. Called reinforcement learning, it defines what actions software agents should take to maximize a certain type of reward after learning from reward and punishment. In an interview, he urges people to be more optimistic about the things AI can do rather than be obsessed with the fear around AI machines. Edited excerpts:
How was the Stanford AI report conceived? How did you get involved?In the last 5-10 years, the public has been forced to take notice of AI. You do searches, for instance, and get the information you want. You can talk to your phone using Apples Siri. There is so much intelligence in your car. Everywhere, intelligent software is assisting you in your lifestyle in a very noticeable way. The common mans perception is that AI is taking away jobs. Jobs that people used to do about 10 years back have been replaced either partially or even fully in some cases by software and hardware developments. This triggered the conversation, which led to experts being asked about their opinion of where AI is heading and what can be done about it.In the last few months, there have been some alarmist views, even by physicist Stephen Hawking. Moreover, even a person like Elon Musk, who is responsible for taking technology forward with his ventures like Tesla and SpaceX, has expressed similar sentimentsthat things could go awfully wrong once we have AI doing actions that human beings traditionally have done.Eric (Horvitz, a computer scientist and technical fellow at Microsoft) has been with Microsoft Research and is primarily responsible for this report. He decided that we needed a more sober assessment of AInot based on emotions but one that is more rigorous and scientific. We will have a study panel every five years. This is the first one. I was chosen by Peter (Peter Stone, professor at the department of computer science, University of Texas) because the study panel was looking at diversity in age, gender and geography. This came together in May 2015, and we were given a year to do this. As a group, we agreed that it is true that AI is game-changing, that it is moving at a fast pace. Hence, we did not forecast beyond 2030, because it is not scientific to do so when there is so much uncertainty about the concept.Can you list some of these uncertainties?Look back to 1995. I dont think it was possible way back then to predict accurately some of the things that we have today. The Internet has happened, so have smartphones and social networks. Its the nature of science and technology which makes it difficult to predict beyond a certain period. There are just too many variables.What was your contributions to the AI report?My contribution was more to define AI. We take intelligence for granted in human beings. We expect people to be able to do certain tasks, to answer questions meaningfully etc. So what are the operating principles that define intelligence? How is it constructed? What are its mathematical foundations? We have asked these questions earlier too, and even in the 70s we had automata (a machine which performs a range of functions according to a predetermined set of coded instructions).For instance, you still have churches where clocks do specific tasks (for example, birds chiming) when their gongs strike midnight. The confluence of software and mathematics really took place in the 1950s when computers became available. We had the Eniac (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) which was built during the war (World War II), and it became possible to build computer systems that could exhibit intelligence. So technically speaking, the first such computer systems were aimed at helping soldiers during the Warused to calculate things like the trajectory of a missile; planning logistics, etc. This explains why DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) has been funding computer science in general and AI for a long time. But the pioneers of AI have also been thinking about AI in scientific terms. Scientists like Alan Turing, who can be considered to be the fountainhead of AI despite the fact that he did not have access to real hardware, was one (such, who was),  thinking about writing a programme to play chess.So what exactly is AI?The term was coined only in 1956 in a workshop (Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence) put together by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon and Nathaniel Rochester. So you can think of AI as a branch of computer science but it is multidisciplinary: it has constant inputs from psychologists, linguists, roboticists, etc. You know intelligence when you see it. But how do you get an artificial agent to show intelligence? Most people would consider a machine to be endowed with AI if it performs like a human being. You can think of examples like Google search or Google Maps. Computers can play chess, which was the holy grail of AI, and now even beat grandmasters. We think of intelligence as a spectrum that is constantly being propelled forward. And AI is what can do this. In some sense, AI is this desire to replicate intelligence in hardware. It is also, in a strange sense, the sum total of what an AI researcher is doingsomething in robotics, NLP (natural language processing), etc. AI does not have a rigid definition. Hence we went with (Nils J.) Nilssons definition in the AI report (AI is that activity devoted to making machines intelligent, and intelligence is that quality that enables an entity to function appropriately and with foresight in its environment).What does the AI concept comprise?The broad architecture of an intelligent agent is one that senses the environment, which does some amount of thinking, and then takes actions in the real world. If you consider sensing, there is the whole area of Computer Vision, which tries to make sense of objects we see. We, then, have the field of speech processing that has to do with audio. When you go to actuation, you have fields like robotics, haptics, etc. AI also comprises machine learning, knowledge representation and logic. Humans typically make changes to their behaviour as they learn from experiences. So if the experience that a programme undergoes somehow changes its behaviour, you can say that the programme is applying machine learning. Now we have data-driven machine learning. Consider the case of hospitals gathering patient datavital parameters like blood sugar level, age, gender, blood pressure, etc. Now lets presume the hospital has collected this data for, say, 1,000 patients and diagnosed diabetic patients from this lot. A machine learning algorithm can then sift through this data and learn a predictor and predict whether a new patient (whose body parameters are available) is diabetic or not. Similar is the case with Google search that has moved from also displaying irrelevant links to using machine learning algorithms that have refined this task over the last few years.The technical base for designing machine learning systems comes primarily from streams like probability and statistics. Then we have NLP, which is the most natural. By speaking natural languages that is quite different from the language that computers use to communicate (1s and 0sbits and bytes), NLP has got to a state when you can take a shot at machine translation. The basic building blocks for NLP comprise actual models of languages. The linguistic hierarchy of language begins with syntax, moving on to semantics (study of relationships between words and how we construct meaning) and later, pragmatics (e.g. you can use sarcasm, punstypically where you need an understanding of culture and context). Anyone dealing with NLP has to know these branches.What about Deep Learning?Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) aim to simulate the human brain. They can be used to map inputs to predictions. There are standard learning algorithms to train ANNs based on data. Neural networks have been around for almost three decades but it was very difficult to train large and deep (with more layers) neural networks. Technically, they get stuck in the so-called Local Minimum (defined as the best solution to a problem within a small neighbourhood of possible solutions as opposed to the concept of global optimum, which is the optimal solution when every possible solution is considered). Ironically, you do need ANNs with many layers. Deep Learning helps us to successfully train larger ANNs.Will true AI ever be achieved?This has divided researchers over the decades. Most people in the AI community subscribe to the view that it does not really matter if machines are exactly replicating what human beings can do, as long as we do things that are intelligent and of value. For example, we have software that can fly an aircraftvery differently from how a human being would do it but it is doing it nevertheless.What are the challenges? Explaining AI to the public itself is a challenge. That said, can inputs be automatically learnt or combined in ways that can give higher level abstractions, to make the task of prediction easier? In the context of vision, the inputs to computer vision systems is just images (matrix of 0s and 1s). But deep learning algorithms are able to abstract things out like edges, boundaries, locations of objects, etc. You can have a deep learning system to autonomously drive a car. The software agent needs to reason about stop signs, etc., (and) not only about camera images; it has to learn a host of features from scratch. The other challenge is that hardware needs to match the pace of development in software. The brain also uses less energy than the chips that we are building today, which are simulating our neurons using a different architecture that generates a lot of heat. Hence, there is a move to develop specialized hardware using a neural architecture as opposed to the traditional Von Neumann architecture. If this becomes a reality a decade from now, we will be able to do a lot more with neural networks than we can now. Not only does a neural network need to be good at its task, it should also be energy efficient.There is a lot of scare-mongering around AI. What is your perspective on this issue?People are driven a lot by what they see in movies. Part of the common persons concern is around the Frankenstein that will do nasty things. The fact is that AI is beginning to work in very specialized tasks like controlling an airplane or driving your car. Its hard to think of any general AI machine that can do all of these tasks in unisonclearly something that humans excel at. As far as AI machines are concerned, this is certainly not on the horizon for at least the next 15-20 years. This scare is unfounded. But the fear that certain types of jobs will vanish because AI (software bots and machines) will do it more efficiently is genuine. Policy makers should prepare themselves for this, and proactively retrain and reskill the people who will be affected to help them cope better with the situation.",2017-01-23,BTmqgM825lBVJvZGYCMz9H,IIT Bombay professor Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan urges people to be more optimistic about the things artificial intelligence can do,competitor,05:29,AI is the desire to replicate intelligence in machines: Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan
0.18,"In the March quarter, gross fixed capital formation fell to 29.4% of gross domestic product (GDP). That is the lowest since the new GDP series started in June 2011 and aptly sums up the state of private investment in the country.
				   
				At the industry level, the brunt of this investment slowdown is seen in the financials and order books of capital goods makers. In the March quarter, the revenue of the top seven capital goods makers grew 5% from a year ago, which was a surprise. However, their aggregate order inflows fell 2%, according to data from Kotak Institutional Equities. Larsen and Toubro Ltd missed its order inflow guidance of 0-5% growth for fiscal 2016. In the March quarter, orders fell 9%. Crompton Greaves Ltds domestic business and ABB Ltd didnt fare much better.Things havent improved in the current quarter as well. The manufacturing sectors purchasing manager index (PMI) for May shows capital goods orders and production growth continue to fall. There is excess capacity (look no further than the power generation industry) in many sectors and firms are repairing leveraged balance sheets and selling non-core assets to stay afloat.With global growth also not in a rosy shape, and the Middle East, a key market for Indian capital goods makers, battling low oil prices, there is no confidence that foreign orders will save the day.Whats more worrying is that even the current order book might not lead to revenue growth. Take Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltds (Bhels) management guidance for instance. It said that of the current order backlog of Rs.1.1 trillion, at least Rs.50,000 crore worth projects are either slow-moving or stressed, according to a note from Religare Securities Ltd. Overall, the weak financials of client firms and the all-too-familiar problems of land and fuelwhich still affect many projectsdepress the outlook for revenue growth in the current fiscal.For Bhel, this translates into a shrinking of sales in FY17, compared with the previous year; in turn, leading to more margin pressure. Other firms, too, face margin pressure. As energy and commodity prices have resumed their climb, the margin kick from lower input costs will also wear away.Unless demand and order inflows perk up, there is no way to justify the rise in the stock prices of capital goods makers. The BSE Capital Goods Index has risen 12.7% since the start of this fiscal (till 2 June), compared with 6% for the Sensex. Kotak Institutional Equities says valuations of industrial stocks are quite stiff even after factoring in a significant recovery in earnings.",2016-06-10,BX4W2lKpL3XTxs5HQRuOTP,"With global growth not rosy, and the Middle East, a key market for Indian capital goods makers, battling low oil prices, there is no confidence foreign orders will save the day

-0.01,"Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) had reported a premium of $3.1 per barrel over the Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) for the March quarter. For the June quarter, that premium was expected to expand further. However, the reported premium of $6.5 per barrel, the highest in the last eight years according to RIL, far exceeded Street estimates. Most analysts had estimated the companys GRM to be in the range of $9.5-10 per barrel. On the contrary, RILs GRM in the June quarter came in at $11.5 per barrel.
				   
				There are a couple of reasons for this outperformance. One, as Alok Agarwal, chief financial officer at RIL, said, We did have a build-up in inventory towards the end of last quarter and we were able to liquidate that inventory at better prices than at the end of the last quarter. Secondly, middle distillates, which include gas oil (diesel) and aviation fuel and account for nearly 45% of the companys product slate, performed better. Our crude sourcing was competitive too, pointed out Agarwal.Even as the GRM beat is strong, not everybody is impressed. Theres no point in taking a call on GRM alone, said independent analyst S.P. Tulsian. He added that looking at inventory at the end of the last fiscal year, it is likely that inventory gains, perhaps to the extent of approximately $2.5 per barrel, are included in the reported GRM.Nonetheless, the fact remains that a strong performance by the refining segment did help the company beat analysts estimates by a good margin. But its worth remembering that the RIL stock has already gone up in the past five trading sessions.Moreover, the performance of other business segments is not very encouraging. Sure, petrochemicals business Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin improved to 14.9% from 14% in the March quarter. But that was largely in line with Street estimates. While the oil and gas business reported an Ebit of Rs.48 crore compared with a loss in the March quarter, it hardly moves the needle for RIL. Losses of US shale operations increased.Stand-alone revenue declined about 19%, reflecting the decline in broader crude oil prices, while net profit increased about 19% to Rs.7,548 crore. That was because of a 628 basis point jump in operating profit margin to 20%, while depreciation cost declined 3% and other income increased 18.5%, helping net profit growth. A basis point is 0.01%.What of the stock? RIL shares have underperformed the benchmark Sensex since it announced its March quarter numbers. Some reasons for the underperformance can be attributed to the fact that the company had guided analysts about delays in commissioning of its downstream projects, lower refining margin environment and lack of clarity on the timelines of its telecom launch.Currently, one RIL share trades at about 11 times its estimated earnings per share for this fiscal year. Of course, news flow on the telecom launch will be an important measure to track and so will developments on commissioning of downstream expansion projects. In the near term, what is worrisome is that Singapore refining margins have hardly improved. Even as RIL delivered a great beat in the June quarter, the pertinent questions are whether that will sustain. As of now, analysts dont see inventory gains recurring for the current quarter.The crude spreads that are relevant to RILs refineries have contracted in June and July 2016 from levels in April and May 2016, according to ICICI Securities Ltd. This contraction of light-heavy crude spread would hit RILs GRM if it sustains, wrote analysts from ICICI Securities in a note on 7 July. Unfortunately for investors, it could well mean that the robust GRM performance seen last quarter may not be repeated in the current one.The writer does not have positions in the companies discussed here.",2016-07-16,BYyVceR6MiTJTGQ0FWjPEK,"Most analysts had estimated its gross refining margins to be $9.5-10 per barrel; on the contrary, RILs margins in the June quarter came in at $11.5 per barrel

-0.67,"Vodafone Group Plc said it was hit by an impairment charge of 6.38 billion ($6.86 billion) with respect to its investment in India. After accounting for a deferred tax asset, the net impairment charge was lower at 5 billion. A little over six years ago, it had written down goodwill and other intangible assets by £2.3 billion ($3.33 billion).
				   
				On both occasions, the company cited an increase in competitive pressure, leading to a reassessment of profit growth projections, which led to large write-downs in the carrying value of Vodafones India assets. Its worthwhile noting here that Vodafone had paid a hefty premium while acquiring the India operations in 2007, and it isnt surprising that the bloated value of intangible assets have to be periodically written down.Even so, Vodafones impairment charge this time around looks fairly high, at more than double the previous one. Note that so far this year, market capitalizations of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd have fallen by around $2 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, reflecting the large value erosion in the sector. As such, the large write-down only underscores the troubles the sector is facing. Six years ago, when the previous impairment charge was taken by Vodafone, it had assumed Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) growth of 17.5% on an average in the five years till March 2015. Interestingly, organic profit growth ranged 15-20% during this period, although it fell sharply to 4.1% in fiscal year 2015-16. With the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, sluggish growth rates are expected to continue. The growth assumptions for the current impairment testing assume Ebitda growth of 7.8% on an average in the next five years. A new entrant has recently launched free trial services for an extended time period and commercial price plans that were at a significant discount to prevailing market pricing, resulting in competitive responses from other operators. This has created a high degree of uncertainty over a range of commercial planning assumptions including future pricing, profitability and market structure, the company said in a statement. This is perhaps the first official acknowledgment that Reliance Jios launch has been hugely value destructive. Strangely enough, despite the diminishing returns from the sector, large companies are increasing capital expenditure to retain market share. As a result, return ratios are falling from already low levels. The only silver lining, from an investors perspective, is that share prices of Indian telcos have already fallen sharply in recent months, and seem to be pricing in a fairly bad future.",2016-11-16,Bd3qtEbVPw0PwNRCxQwYxH,"At 6.38 billion, Vodafones impairment charge this time around looks fairly high, at more than double the previous one",competitor,07:51,"Vodafone sees sluggish growth, thanks to Reliance Jio"
-0.69,"Last November, when Idea Cellular Ltd agreed to pay top dollar for Videocon Telecommunications Ltds spectrum, it looked like the much-awaited consolidation in the industry was becoming a costly exercise. But Idea Cellular has walked out of the deal, and while Videocon has found another buyer in Bharti Airtel Ltd, valuations have come crashing down. 
				   
				Its premature to conclude that rationality has returned to the industry. Even so, the Videocon deal has some heartening takeawaysof course, for everyone except Videocon. The delay in Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds launch means companies can breathe a bit easier. And the likelihood that the government will harmonize spectrum in 1800 megahertz (MHz) band before this years auction means that this resource may not be as scarce as was earlier feared. Idea Cellular had agreed to pay Rs.3,310 crore for contiguous 1800MHz spectrum in Gujarat and UP (West) circles. This effectively worked out to a 133% premium vis-à-vis the latest reserve price recommended by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. By the same measure, Videocon may have expected another Rs.3,000 crore for the remaining four circles in which it has similar spectrum. That means the amount for all six circles would be about Rs.6,610 crore. Instead, it has agreed to sell spectrum in all six circles to Bharti Airtel for a much lower amount of Rs.4,428 crore. While Videocon has settled for lower valuations vis-à-vis last November, the sale price represents a 100% premium to its purchase price. Another way to look at the deal is that Bharti Airtel is acquiring the spectrum at 34% of the last discovered price for 900MHz spectrum in these circles, whereas Idea Cellular had agreed to pay as much as 55% for the two circles it had agreed to buy. According to analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, the price of 1800 relative to the price of 900 was 35% in A-category circles and 47% in metro circles in the March 2015 auctions. Bharti Airtel, therefore, appears to have struck a reasonable deal, especially keeping in mind that the entire spectrum is contiguous and hence suitable for deploying 4G services. The six circles contribute to 23% of Bharti Airtels revenue. Also, it will now have 4G spectrum in 19 circles, versus 15 earlier. Bhartis 4G-1800 spectrum footprint is now slightly better than that of Reliance Jio, JM Financials analysts wrote in a 17 March note. Interestingly, while Bharti Airtel shares rose 1.3% on the National Stock Exchange on Thursday, those of Idea Cellular gained 3.15%. Of course, investors will be relieved that Idea Cellular backed out of the expensive deal. And as far as the gaps in its 4G footprint go, the auction later this year is likely to provide opportunities to fill them. Besides, as pointed out earlier, with the delay in Reliance Jios launch, companies have been able to breathe a bit easy. Having said all this, the industry is far from being out of the woods. At best, Idea Cellular may have ended up saving about Rs.1,000 crore, which isnt much, considering that it had paid as much as Rs.30,000 crore in the March 2015 auction. Recent data suggests that growth in data revenue is falling and is calling to question the high amounts firms have spent on spectrum purchases and network roll-outs.

				Growth in both revenue and profit declined, largely because of a higher-than-expected drop in realizations, but also because of lower volume growth.The big surprise in the results was the sharp deceleration in growth in the data segment. In the case of Idea Cellular Ltd, data revenue grew 45% year-on-year last quarter, a sharp drop from the over 80% growth just two quarters ago. Price realizations in the segment fell by as high as 17% year-on-year. For Bharti Airtel Ltd, data realizations fell 13.1% last quarter, much higher than the 5.6% drop reported in the September quarter.Idea Cellulars management said in a note to investors, (there is) intense pressure on the mobile data realized rate, as wireless broadband consumer demand growth is slower than increased supply from operators launching/expanding 3G/4G footprints. Its quite disheartening, from an investors perspective, that this is happening even ahead of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds launch. Supply will increase manifold when Jio launches its services commercially.Incumbents such as Idea and Bharti have spent vast amounts of money in purchasing spectrum, and have stepped up capital expenditure to capitalize on the data opportunity. The December quarter results suggest that data is proving to be a drag rather than a money-spinner. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities wrote in a note to clients, We are slightly concerned about the data volume trajectory, especially in the context of accelerated 3G/4G network rollouts by the operators. We, however, think it is too early to call out a definitive trend here.Investors are taking a very grim view of the future.

-0.55,"New Delhi: Online eyewear retailer Lenskart, which forayed into the premium segment with private label John Jacobs a couple of years ago, is now planning to expand the labels footprint in India by launching new stores, according to a top company executive.
				   
				The label, which has three retail stores across Delhi and Bengaluru, is set to launch a fourth one next week. The company aims to have 10 John Jacobs retail outlets in the next one year across the two cities. While Lenskart launched the first John Jacobs retail store in 2015 to test waters in the premium market, it remained quiet about this pilot until recently when the company decided to open more stores. In March 2016, Lenskart, run by Lenskart Solutions Pvt. Ltd, appointed former chief executive of food delivery company Foodora Sambuddha Bhattacharya as business head to spearhead John Jacobs.According to the company, while John Jacobs brand is owned by Lenskart Solutions Pvt. Ltd, a franchise of Lenskart, DealsKart Online Services Pvt. Ltd, operates and runs the website and stores of John Jacobs.DealsKart is owned by Lenskart founder Peyush Bansal along with Usha Singhal and Neetu Mittal, according to official documents filed with the registrar of companies.Talking to Mint, Bhattacharya explained that Lenskart supplies materials to franchisee DealsKart to run front-end operations. However, the need to create an independent website, mobile application (currently work in progress) and retail stores for John Jacobs lies in the fact that it caters to a different market segment than Lenskart, said Bhattacharya. While Lenskarts vision is to become a (multi-brand) retailer, (focus on) tier 2 expansion, go on to provide affordable access to eyewear, it made more sense to create John Jacobs a separate (premium) brand because we are solving a different problem... (Through John Jacobs) we are building to be in the affordable luxury segment, he said. A team of 32, the stand-alone brand John Jacobs targets 25-35-year-olds, selling them eyewear at an average price of Rs4,000. 90% of its sales come through its retail stores. Clocking an average of over $830,000 in monthly revenues, the company expects John Jacobs to register $10 million revenue for fiscal 2016-17, up jump from $4 million.The premium brand also retails through shop-in-shop agreement with retail stores of Shoppers Stop, and services online orders from Australia, Philippines and the UK. Delhi-based multi-brand retailer Lenskart sells eyeglasses, sunglasses, contact lenses and eyewear accessories. It has retail stores across 90 cities, and targets Rs3,000 revenue by 2020.

				The theme of this years report, Technology for People, is a call to action for business and technology leaders to actively design and direct technology to augment and amplify human capabilities. The report states that we are beginning to see the emergence of technology for people, by peopletechnology that seamlessly anticipates our needs and delivers hyper-personalized experiences.Accenture identifies five emerging technology trends that are essential to business success in todays digital economy:AI is the new UI: Artificial intelligence (AI) is coming of age, tackling problems both big and small by making interactions simple and smart. AI is becoming the new user interface (UI), underpinning the way we transact and interact with systems. Seventy-nine per cent of survey respondents agree that AI will revolutionize the way they gain information from and interact with customers.Design for humans: Technology design decisions are being made by humans, for humans. Technology adapts to how we behave and learns from us to enhance our lives, making them richer and more fulfilling. Eighty per cent of executives surveyed agree that organizations need to understand not only where people are today, but also where they want to beand shape technology to act as their guide to realize desired outcomes. Ecosystems as macrocosms: Platform companies that provide a single point of access to multiple services have completely broken the rules for how companies operate and compete. Companies dont just need a platform strategy, they need a rich and robust ecosystem approach to lead in this new era of intelligence. Already, more than one-quarter (27%) of executives surveyed reported that digital ecosystems are transforming the way their organizations deliver value.Workforce marketplace: The number of on-demand labour platforms and online work-management solutions is surging. As a result, leading companies are dissolving traditional hierarchies and replacing them with talent marketplaces, which in turn is driving the most profound economic transformation since the Industrial Revolution. A case in point: 85% of executives surveyed said they plan to increase their organizations use of independent freelance workers over the next year.The uncharted: To succeed in todays ecosystem-driven digital economy, businesses must delve into uncharted territory. Instead of focusing solely on introducing new products and services, they should think much biggerseizing opportunities to establish rules and standards for entirely new industries.

0.6,"The Essar Group may have been in a debt trap, but there are no signs of distress in the Essar Oil Ltd sale to PJSC Rosneft Oil Co and a consortium led by commodities trader Trafigura and private investment group United Capital Partners. Essar said it has sold a 98% stake in the oil company at an enterprise valuation (EV) of $10.9 billion or Rs72,800 crore.
				   
				This works out to around 12.5 times Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization). Most analysts value Reliance Industries Ltds refining business at an EV/Ebitda multiple of around seven times at best. Prima facie, Essar has got itself a good deal.Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients, The formal announcement of the deal at the recent BRICS summit in the presence of the political leaders of India and Russia suggests a high degree of involvement of the Indian government in the transaction. We note that Indian PSU oil companies had earlier purchased a 49.9% stake in the Vankor oil block of Rosneft.Besides, according to a Bloomberg report, Essar was in talks with as many as five overseas oil companies for the asset sale. Its natural that Rosneft and the consortium ended up paying a premium when the competition was as high.That aside, the Essar asset offers decent growth opportunities. The company has had plans to double capacity at the existing plant, but couldnt do so because of financial constraints. The buyers should be able to follow through on these expansion plans and drive growth. Besides, Essar Oils refinery is in close proximity to the deep draft Vadinar port, which lends greater efficiency to the operations. The port has been acquired in a separate transaction at a valuation of $2 billion. Essar Oil also operates a network of 2,700 retail outlets. They may not have added much to overall profits until now, but their prospects have improved because of increased deregulation of prices of petroleum products.Rosneft can drive synergies by shipping relatively cheap crude oil from Venezuela and the Trafigura connect will help in selling oil products to Asia-Pacific markets.Essar Oil currently processes around 145 million barrels of crude oil annually. According to an oil industry analyst who did not want to be identified, its safe to assume that the company makes an Ebitda of around $6 per barrel, resulting in an annual Ebitda of $870 million. While this results in an expensive valuation of 12.5 times for the refining asset, this must be seen in light of other growth prospects, the added advantage of the port facility and the retail outlets, he adds. What about implications of the deal for Indian companies?The Essar Groups total debt in the system is estimated to be about Rs1.3 trillion, and this is expected to reduce substantially after the deal. While the group will use the proceeds to pay off debt, bank debt will also reduce, as part of Essar Oils debt is being refinanced by a Russian lender, according to news reports.ALSO SEE | Rosneft-Essar Oil deal cuts Essar Groups debt, lifts banksICICI Bank Ltd, one of the largest lenders to the Essar Group, has already seen a nearly $1.5 billion rise in market capitalization after the deal announcement. According to Kotaks analysts, The deal is a significant event for the Indian banking sector for several reasons... Indian banks have become very forceful in addressing the problem of bad loans; and Indian promoters may have little option but to sell profitable assets to reduce debt; this has been the case for the past two years.ALSO SEE | Will Rosneft deal benefit Essar Oil shareholders?Oil marketers may face some threat to their market share depending on how aggressive Rosnefts plans for the retail business are.

-0.81,"Reserve Bank of Indias (RBIs) asset quality review is increasingly looking like a highly successful amnesty scheme for tax evaders: come clean with your hidden income or assets (bad loans in this case), and all shall be forgiven.
				   
				Over the weekend, six state-owned banks reported a combined increase in bad loans of Rs.24,622 crore in the March quarter. This is on the back of Rs.29,538 crore reported in the December quarter; thats when the results of the RBI review became evident. The chart shows the spike for these six lenders, whose combined bad loans top Rs.1.3 trillion, in the last couple of quarters.Their stocks took a hammering and investors were left with a spate of questions.One, with the economy showing signs of improvement and even corporate earnings coming off their bottom, what explains this sudden surge in bad loans? It is not as if asset quality recognition norms have suddenly changed overnight. Clearly, bank managements till now were kicking the can down the road.In fairness, some sectors such as iron and steel and infrastructure have not had it easy for the past many years. They have been the ones repeatedly highlighted by banks as responsible for the rise in bad loans. But only when RBI releases its next financial stability report will the true extent of the rotand how widespread it is, if at allbe known.Two, has the bleeding been stanched? Is this the bottom? The answer is a resounding no.After a fashion, some of the bigger banks have started declaring asset quality watch lists. Bank of Baroda has said that it has suspect quality loans worth Rs.26,900 crore, of which 57% could potentially turn bad this financial year. While the others havent been as forthcoming, the big pile of restructured loans, those refinanced under the 5/25 scheme and loans under the strategic debt restructuring (SDR) process throw up enough red flags.Union Bank of India, for instance, has an SDR portfolio of Rs.1,840 crore, Rs.2,500 crore under 5/25 and Rs.8,500 of standard restructured assets.The net result of this car wreck is losses and the erosion in net worth. Five of these six PSU bankswith the exception of Union Bank of Indiareported losses. Together, they topped Rs.7,000 crore. (To be sure, extra provisions mandated by RBI towards Punjab food credit were also responsible for an increase in provisions).Even if the bad loan pile-up ends here, banks problems dont. Many state-owned banks have a precarious capital position. UCO Bank, for instance, has a capital adequacy ratio of 9.63% at the end of March and Central Bank of India 10.4%.

-1.0,"Mumbai: Manishi Raychaudhuri, head of Asia (ex-Japan), equity strategy at BNP Paribas Securities, expects the US Federal Reserve to increase interest rates in December. In an interview, he says he continues to expect emerging market equities to outperform developed market equities. Raychaudhuri has an overweight stance on China, India, South Korea and  Thailand in Asia. Edited excerpts:
Now that the US Federal Reserve and Bank of Japans (BoJ) decisions have arrived, what do you make of these developments?

The common thread running through both the policymakers decisions is that they both decided to keep interest rates unchanged. However, the approaches are different. BoJ wanted to steepen the yield curve considerably as they are beginning to understand that a flattish yield curve hurts banks profitability and clearly they wanted to correct it. The Fed, on the other hand, are trying to signal that the normalized interest rates for the US are now a lot lower than they used to be historically. Our guess is that a rate hike will happen only in December. We also believe that this particular rate hike cycle will be much more benign than the previous three or four that we have seen.What does it mean for emerging markets, including India?
Over past rate hike episodes spanning 45-50 years, only once did the US dollar appreciate. In all other episodes, the dollar either depreciated or just stayed flat. So, if that is the case, there is no strong case for the appreciation of the US dollar, and the rate hike episode is likely to be much more dovish that we have seen in the past; then the necessary conclusion from there is that the money flows into emerging markets and Asian equities may not really suffer as badly as we have seen in the past. For the last 8-10 months, our basic point of view has been that the emerging markets equities should outperform the developed market equities. That stance remains intact.In Asia, which equity markets are your best bets?
We are overweight on China, India, South Korea and Thailand. Why do you think China is attractive?
Even as China is facing the problem of a growth slowdown, we think if the stock selection is done correctly, there are enough bets in China which portfolio managers can focus on. If we go back 25 years, the basic expenses of a Chinese household amounted to around 60% of its income. Over the years, that has dropped to around 40-43%. What is growing is education, health, leisure, consumer discretionaries and so on. We call this theme Changing China or New China.What makes the Indian market an attractive bet?
India is relatively a safer and easier story than China, because while China is slowing down, India is moving exactly in the reverse direction. If you go back to two years, the real GDP growth was around 5-5.5%, now it is at around 7-7.5%, and it will possibly settle at around 8% or so. Interestingly, during this growth recovery phase, India is still in a period where interest rates are declining. That is the Goldilocks scenario. It is a rare combination to find in emerging markets today. Tepid rural consumption was holding back earnings growth for the last couple of years. Due to the good monsoon and implementation of the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission, rural consumption is expected to grow from here, once the harvest season sets in and the additional money hits the bank accounts.  Also, investment demand is fine as far as foreign direct investment and government expenditure are concerned. Private capex is the only deterrent at this point of time. Also, corporate earnings in the June quarter were not as bad as previous five years.Are valuations looking stretched for India?
Yes and no. Valuations would look stretched if you compare India to some of the regional peers, but compared to their own historical averages, they look quite okay. Which sectors do you like in India?
We like consumer discretionaries, including consumer proxies, and within that pack we are more tilted to rural consumption. Next are the companies which are a play on potential industrial capex recovery. However, we need to avoid leveraged companies. Building materials are allied to them. We also like private sector banks. After the recent correction, we think there is a good stock selection opportunity in the IT services sector too.",2016-09-25,C8Jgc7RZR7SVQnOm70f1GP,"Investment demand is fine as far as FDI and government expenditure are concerned, says Manishi Raychaudhuri, head of Asia (ex-Japan), equity strategy at BNP Paribas Securities

-0.25,"Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) investors are an undemanding lot. Despite the company missing revenue forecasts, investors have driven up the stock 7% since it declared disappointing March-quarter earnings. The revenue for the January to March quarter missed estimates. Overall, BELs consolidated revenue grew just 6.4% in the past fiscal year, compared with the managements guidance of 8-10%.
				   
				That said, the miss in revenue growth was somewhat compensated by strong margins and robust order inflows. Profitability rose to multi-year highs as BEL benefited from low costs and indigenization of work orders. Order inflows tripled as the firm signed several large contracts during the year. As a result, the order backlog jumped 48% from a year ago to Rs.32,022 crore. That is 4.2 times revenues for 2015-16 and, at first blush, signals earnings visibility in the quarters ahead.The order inflows are expected to be strong this year, too. The finalization of large contracts by the defence forces can keep the order backlog high. The company is eyeing sizeable value of projects going ahead both in its conventional areas and several first-of-its-kind projects, Edelweiss Securities Ltd said in a note.While this order book may have excited investors, it is not leading to any earnings upgrades. If anything, some analysts have pared their estimates for the current financial year. The bugbear remains slow revenue growth, which few analysts believe, will revive this year.According to ICICI Securities Ltd, BELs large order backlog will take more than two years for execution. Also, as BEL began accepting turnkey contracts (responsible for implementation of full systems, rather than parts), margins are expected to shrink. These orders require purchases from third parties which can crimp profitability, ICICI Securities adds.Thus, brokerages are reducing profit growth forecasts. We have marginally tweaked our earnings estimate downward by 2-3% for FY17/18E to factor in lower-than-expected revenue performance; earnings downgrade was restricted on account of better-than-expected margins exit rate for Q4FY16, Sharekhan Ltd said in a note.Analysts expect current orders to drive BELs revenue and earnings from fiscal 2018 onwards. But the assumptions for these forecasts, too, are not watertight. Sensitive technologies, dependency on multiple authorities for clearances and delays mean revenue could continue to be lumpy.The company is trying to counter this with increasing focus on exports and vendor collaboration.

0.06,"Mumbai: The National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) has battled several issues this yearthere was a stand off with shareholders on its listing plans; allegations surfaced of allowing unfair access to some brokers; and managing director Chitra Ramkrishna resigned unexpectedly. 
				   
				In an interview, chairman Ashok Chawla said the initial share sale of the nations largest exchange will likely happen in the beginning of the April-June quarter after it hires a new managing director and completes corrective action based on a forensic audit to examine allegations of unfair access to its algorithm trading platform. Edited excerpts: NSE has been in the eye of a storm in the recent past. NSE is an efficient and well-oiled organization and it is not for nothing that the exchange over the years has grown from zero percent market share to 85%. In an organization, issues do come up sometime that are not necessarily defining aspects. There have been some technological issues in the past, which were resolved in 2014 and are also under investigation to prevent any future occurrences. Listing of the exchange is being pursued with a fair degree of rigour, as it is only appropriate that the existing shareholders get an exit option. Resignation of the managing director and CEO had nothing to do with thispeople come and go for many reasons. In her case it was personal reasons.The NSE management has mostly been averse to listing in the past. NSE wasnt opposed to listing, but they had two concerns the need for restructuring of the company into regulated and unregulated businesses, and a perception that if they list on a competing exchange it could lead to some troubles. Last few months the board has looked at these issues; restructuring is worth looking at at some point but that should not be something that the listing process should be held hostage to. Listing on the other exchange is the regulators decision so we will abide by that. What would be the size of the offer?The offer for sale (OFS) is not to raise money as we have adequate cash on our books. All the 70 shareholders of NSE have been asked to offer some of their shares in the OFS, which is coming to be around 20-25%. ALSO READ: NSE must list sans hubris or risk investor scornThe current Sebi rules do not allow for an overseas listing, so is the overseas listing off the table?There was some thinking initially to tap global markets through overseas listing but for now we are restricting ourselves to domestic listing. We could revisit it later. We had earlier said that by January we would file a Draft Red Herring Prospectus with Sebi but now we have preponed the timeline and would file by 20 December for a domestic listing.Issues have been raised that the NSE board examining the issues of alleged unfair access to certain brokers while accessing the algorithmic trading platform is a case of NSE investigating itself.As per the Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India) directive, we have commissioned a forensic audit to examine the allegations and the report is expected from Deloitte India in few days. We would submit the entire report to the regulator and if the board has some observations and comments to offer then we would add those. Whether there would be a fair examination of the allegations considering that NSE has commissioned the audit, you should ask the regulator. There would be some confidence that Sebi has in the NSE board.Considering the timelines you have highlighted would it be safe to say that the exchange would not list till the new CEO is in place and the issues around allegations of unfair access are resolved?Yes, we would not list till these two issues are resolved as this is the prudent thing to do. The new MD and CEO would be in place before the end of the first quarter of the coming calendar. Corrective actions based on the forensic audit in consultation with Sebi would also be finished around the same time. As to listing this would happen around the beginning of the second quarter of the calendar year. Is NSE okay with listing on a rival exchangebecause of the concerns of conflict of interest that may arise out of cross listing remain?We have requested Sebi to provide some comfort in existing regulations. For instance, in case the exchange, acting as regulator, proposes an action against an exchange which is listed on its platform perhaps it could be looked at by some external party or independent member. Sebi is positively considering the proposal, if it comes then it would give the parties some ease and if it doesnt then the philosophy behind cross listing isyou cant be a judge of your own cause and we will honour that. ALSO READ: NSE CEO exit: Examining Sebi, NSE boards roles There have been many reports pointing to differences with the board being the reason for Chitra Ramkrishnas exit from NSE.Differences with the board are something like what two people have while talking across a table, nothing more than that. At least there were no issues between the board and the ex-CEO that could have prompted such a move on her part, so to that extent I deny (these claims). Reportedly, the board was concerned about the appointment of the group chief operating officer Anand Subramanian. So, are you saying that the board had no concerns on his appointment?Well, there is no merit in visiting that issue today. This was something that happened in the past and we would like to leave it there. While BSEs Gujarat International Finance Tech (GIFT) plans seem crystallized, we have not heard much from NSE on its plans for GIFT. Would you be able to take us through your plans for GIFT City?You are right, as per the media reports BSE is launching on 9 January. You can expect NSE to launch just a little later.

-1.0,"Gas firms stocks have had a good run this fiscal year. So far, share prices of GAIL (India) Ltd, Indraprastha Gas Ltd (IGL) and Petronet LNG Ltd have risen in the range of 21-60%. 
				   
				The Mahanagar Gas Ltd (MGL) stock has gone up about 80% from its issue price since listing. Not without reason.For one, the operating environment for these companies has improved. Stocks of city gas distributors such as IGL and MGL are being re-rated on account of better volume growth outlook and margin improvement. Analysts expect further improvement in profit margins of IGL and MGL on account of the recent gas price cut. But that should show in the December quarter results. For Petronet, higher liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand and bringing forward the completion of its Dahej expansion augur well.Secondly, all the above companies put up a remarkable show in the June quarter. MGL and IGL saw operating profit margins expand. GAILs petrochemical business swung to profit at the Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) level in the June quarter from a loss in fiscal year 2016. In fact, its petrochemical segment is expected to continue to report profit for this year, helped by higher volumes from its expanded petrochemical facility.Currently, GAIL, IGL, MGL and Petronet trade at 15.6 times, 19.5 times, 20 times and 23.5 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year, respectively. Valuations arent cheap. It is possible that the September quarter results may not turn out to be as robust as the June quarter. Still, its not that expectations are low for the September quarter.Strong LNG demand should help keep utilization levels at Petronets Dahej terminal high. Management had indicated partial commissioning of a vaporizer at Dahej at the end of 1Q. Further updates on start of the expanded facility and resolution of Kochi pipeline RoU (right of use) issues will be key to watch out for, wrote Arya Sen and Ranjeet Jaiswal of Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a report on 10 October.For IGL, Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd expects September quarter compressed natural gas volumes at 3.4 million standard cubic metres per day or mscmd (+10% YoY, +3% QoQ). The brokerage firm has modelled total volumes of 4.4/4.6 mscmd in FY17/FY18. MGL is expected to report healthy volume too. GAILs petrochemical business is likely to continue the positive momentum. Investors would do well to follow the ramp-up on the Pata petrochemical expansion for the GAIL stock. From a medium-term perspective, if crude oil prices improve, then margins of the companys petrochemical and LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) business should expand. However, worries about potential losses from its US LNG contracts (which are supposed to work out pricier than spot LNG prices in Asia) act as an overhang.",2016-10-18,CJXu7dBUyyhnwu5zF6QCON,Stocks of city gas distributors such as IGL and MGL are being re-rated on account of better volume growth outlook and margin improvement,both,23:18,Gas stocks offer reason to cheer
0.25,"Private equity (PE) firm Kedaara Capital Advisors Ltd, co-founded by PE veteran Manish Kejriwal, is gearing up to float its second fund to raise around $600-650 million, two people familiar with the matter said. The formal process is expected to begin by mid-2017, one of the persons said on condition of anonymity.
				   
				Kedaara was founded in 2011 by Kejriwal, former India head of Singapore sovereign wealth management fund Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd, Sunish Sharma and Nishant Sharma, who were managing director and principal, respectively, of global PE firm General Atlantic in India.The PE firm raised its debut fund with a corpus of $540 million in 2013, in one of the largest fund-raisings by an independent, home-grown PE platforms until then.Originally targeting $500 million, the fund was oversubscribed, attracting investors from all over. Canadian pension fund Ontario Teachers Pension Plan anchored the vehicle and was joined by other sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, family offices, fund of funds and endowments.On its second outing, the PE firm is currently sending feelers to prospective limited partners (LPs), or investors in investment funds.They are initiating soft conversations with prospective LPs now and will embark on a formal fund-raising process only by mid-next year, said the first person cited above on condition on anonymity.The move to launch a second fund comes on the heels of two stellar exits recorded by the firm.They have registered stellar exits in a short frame of time. They have made about 75% IRR (internal rate of return) in Au Financiers and about 55% IRR in Bill Forge, added the second person.In September, automotive components supplier Mahindra CIE Automotive, a joint venture between Mahindra Group and CIE of Spain, agreed to acquire a 100% stake in Bengaluru-based machine components manufacturer Bill Forge, for about $200 million.Kedaara, which acquired 50% stake in Bill Forge last year for around $48 million, exited completely. In June, it exited Au Financiers Ltd, a retail non-banking financial services company and one of the 10 firms to receive in-principle approval to start a small finance bank.A report in VCCircle said that foreign investors sold their holdings in Au Financiers in part or full in a deal worth $110 million to help the latter bring down the foreign holding to 49% from 64% to comply with one of the prerequisites for a small bank licence.When contacted, Kedaaras co-founder and managing director Kejriwal said, We do not comment on market rumours.Both Kedaaras recent exits have been quick compared to the usual PE  investment horizon of three to five years.The speedy exits by Kedaara could well be a good thing for the PE firm. A recent study by McKinsey & Co.s Private Equity and Principal Investment Group showed that PE returns drop as holding periods increase. According to the study, PE investments with holding periods of between one and three years delivered above 40% return, higher than any other holding period.The performance on exits shown by Kedaara also comes at a time when the Indian PE industry, notorious for its poor exit performance, has witnessed over $16 billion worth of exits in the past two years.According to data from Venture Intelligence, so far in 2016, PE funds have registered exits worth $6.7 billion, while in 2015, PE funds recorded exits worth $9.4 billion. The 2015 exit performance was the highest in the past five years.Kedaaras debut deal was an investment of Rs200 crore in Mahindra Logistics Ltd in April 2014. It has also invested in companies such as Parksons Packaging Ltd and Manjushree Technopack. Its latest investment was the buyout of Au Housing Finance, the mortgage arm of Au Financiers, along with Swiss PE firm Partners Group, for around $140 million.The private equity firm is about 55% committed across six investments which is about $300 million and has invested across sectors, said the second person cited above.Kedaara positions itself as an operationally oriented PE firm pursuing control and minority investment opportunities in India.

-0.25,"When was the last time you listened to music on an actual CD? Or read the days headlines in a physical newspaper? Chances are it has been years. Digital technology and software has replaced a lot of things in our lives.
				   
				According to media futurist Robert Tercek, going forward, we will see more of vaporization, a term he has coined to refer to the process of replacing physical things with software that can be downloaded to any device. The apps on your phone have quietly replaced newspapers, books, music players, diaries and countless other things.We are moving from millions to billions, to trillions of connected devices, and the invisible world of software is growing at twice the rate of the normal economy, says Tercek.As more people connect to the network, the software of the network becomes more valuable and that drives even more people to connect, increasing the value of the network. In an interview, Tercek, the former president of digital media at The Oprah Winfrey Network and author of the book Vaporized, talks about how software is disrupting society. Edited excerpts:You say we are moving to a software-defined society. How is that changing the way the economy functions?The first rule thats important for the software world is this idea that the network is more valuable and the devices get cheaperthat changes the economics. Its very difficult for manufacturing companies to understand that in the future products will be cheaper, but also more valuable. Devices will get cheaper and smarter. Metcalfes Law says the network will get more valuable over time. For the end-users, things cost less, so they expect devices to be cheaper and smarter and they expect to get more value out of them. For companies that manufacture products, this is very difficult. Those companies are vulnerable to Internet economics, the economics of Facebook or Google. Thats a challenge that most havent realized.All companies will become software companies. The implication of that has not yet sunk in and many companies are still operating in old industrial styles. They seldom realize that software is far more important than the physical product. Auto manufacturers, for instance, dont see themselves as software companies; they see themselves as car makers. They think the value is in the metal, rubber and plastic. The value is very quickly moving to software. The companies that focus on software for auto are going to be most successful. We saw the same thing in personal computers, mobile phones and consumer electronics: software eventually became more important than the physical device.Which industries are most prone to vaporization? Are any immune?No industry is immune. I also think that governments, education and healthcare will soon be affected, so this is a mega trend that will reshape the whole society. The industries that have been most affected so far are finance, media, consumer electronics and advertising. The next that will be transformed are healthcare, transportation, education and insurance. Everything that happened in infotech during the past 40 years will soon happen to every other industry in the world. So, in a way, you can see that any business that involves geographytransportation, logistics or shoppingwill be transformed into information businesses. Biology is becoming an information science as well, so agriculture, pharmaceuticals, healthcare and the food industry are going to change. We are now able to program biology in the same way we program a computer.Manufacturing is going to be transformed in a couple of ways. The first one is, of course, robotics. Robotics is the replacement of human labour with software, thats what software automation is. The other trends that are important as well are 3D printing and nanotechnology. Theres already now a 3D printer from Revolution Medicine that will take any substance and break it down to its molecular parts, sort them out and then using software, recompose those molecules into new forms, including combinations that dont exist in nature When things are replaced by software, it means that the barriers that constraintime and spaceare eliminated, because software can deliver instantly. China and Asia, the places that we have been outsourcing manufacturing for the US and Europe, (will) no longer have their big advantage. It will erode because now you will be able to manufacture in any place using software.How are governments changing the way they function?In the past, most governments used human labour to enforce regulation and process paper and handle information. In both cases, software can do a better job. When you have sensors measuring everything, you dont need human regulators checking everything. You can simply do that with software and have better data than we get from human inspectors, so enforcement regulation will change tremendously. In future, we will be able to write the rule in software and encode in a bitcoin(-style) blockchain. All the sensors that are connected to the system will simply report the data and we will have software-defined regulation.In a representative democracy, voting is also [going to be] encoded in the blockchain very soon. We have already seen some parties in Scandinavia use the blockchain for their own internal voting.Whats the future of big corporations like the GEs of the world?The reason we have big corporations is because its more efficient for a company to avoid transaction costs for managing a group of freelance suppliers. As long as its cheaper to do a job internally within a corporation, the job will be done internally. But now the Internet makes it very easy for companies to hire workers who arent on the payroll, workers who are outside the corporation. You can use software to manage them. One way to look at Uber is that it has vaporized managementthe management of the dispatcher is a software program, so job functions have been turned into software. It suggests that we may not need corporations in the future. A company called Ethereum in Canada is trying to replace the entire corporation with software. They are trying to write a software robot program that has all the job functions in the corporation which is kind of a crazy idea, (but it is) actually quite possible.Do big corporations need to drastically change their business models?In industry after industry, corporations move too slowly. They dont go out of business, they just become less relevant because they are not where the growth is. So, if you choose not to participate, you choose not to turn your company into software or replace jobs with software, you wont disappear overnight. A future growth (driver) will emerge and your company will not be part of it. Auto makers and watch makers have a difficult choice to make: they cant stop making cars or watches, thats their business today. At the same time, they see that the future is going to be all about software, and cars or watches will be less important, but they are not good at making software. They certainly arent good enough to compete with Google or other software giants. Should that company embark on a rapid course of action and try to become a software developer or should they partner with Google? If you partner with Google, thats not a great strategy because look at what happened to the smartphone companies. All the companies that manufacture smartphones dont make much money on smartphones: Google literally commoditizes these companies because it sucks the value out of the device and into the network.This is a very difficult challenge for every company that manufactures products: they must become a software company. The question is do they build it themselves, do they buy a company or do they partner with a giant company like Google and become part of their ecosystem? All difficult choices.What do you see emerging as the new sources of competitive advantage in this new world?The companies that understand they have a proprietary data asset will (succeed). What I mean by proprietary data asset is any information asset that grows. In the case of Facebook, thats the social graph. There are many other companies that are mapping the world right now, they are building a location graph. Google has tremendous knowledge about where people are surfing and where they are going, so they have the interest graph. Each company can thereby define a graph.The idea is that each business has at its core, a unit of information, a body of information. When we move business to the network, that information asset should grow if you design your business in the right way. That will emerge as the most important thing for that company over time: an information asset that continues to grow as more people and more devices are connected.Companies that dont rush to embrace often lose their information advantage and someone else comes and steals that from them. So, one way to look at all the struggles that are happening around the world right now, is theres a battle happening for control of data assets. You see this when Google is confronted by the European government about privacy, or when Apple is confronted by the FBI about secrecy and security. Most companies do not understand how to manage or protect their data assets. The successful companies make (data protection) a priority.So, what do you think the Fortune 500 list will look like 20 years from now? What kind of companies will you see there and which ones would be gone?Big automotive makers will be replaced by big companies that provide transportation as a service. Banks will be replaced by companies that provide automatic, secure transactions using the blockchain or something similar Today, the businesses of pharmaceutical companies is a bit like Hollywood: they spend lots of money making drugs and they hope that one becomes a big hit and they make billions of dollars. In the future, you will have customized medical treatment designed for your genome. It will be individualized healthcare. So, pharmaceutical (companies will) shift from mass manufacturing drugs to more of a service delivery model that will be customized to individuals. The companies themselves may stay and remain successful, but they will change into software companies that provide digital services.What other areas will feel the impact?Education will be delivered in software in the future and this bothers a lot of people who feel very sentimental about college education. Its obvious that most people in the world cant afford to go to a private college, most university systems [cannot] take in millions of new students. There has to be an alternative. Software delivery education is the reality today. Its not as good as college education, but remember, these are early days. We have to educate a billion people a year, theres no way we can do that within campus. Robotics will shift so many people out of jobs, everyone will have to retrained. Every worker will have to reskill and retrain consistently. One of the things we will have to do is learn how to work with machines, robots and software automation.If you think about all the really big industries in the worldhealthcare, food supply, transportation, energyall these enormous systems have been designed to serve human beings. That worked well for the last 200 years, but heres the question: if you can vaporize everything, the ultimate expression is to replace the human body by software. Can we replace the human body with software? It seems preposterous, yet there are scientists working right now to model the human brain and replicate the human being in software. Some scientists are working on whole brain emulation. Why? One, there are a lot of places we cant explore: in the depths of the ocean, inside volcanoes, deep inside the earth and also in space. Human beings cant survive in those environments, machines can. If we travel to other stars or planets, the only way thats going to happen is if we can replace the human body, because too much of the weight of spacecraft cargo is life support for human bodies.Is everything about this good?Theres always danger with technology. Technology always makes something that we are familiar with obsolete. You can think of it as super power: it introduces new powers that can be used for good or bad. We shouldnt judge the technology, its really how it is used we should judge, that is a human decision. People are worried about artificial intelligence. This is silly. Its artificial intelligence thats poorly written, (that is used in) the wrong way by human beings, those are things we should be concerned with.Read an unabridged version of the interview on www.foundingfuel.com, published in an exclusive partnership with knowledge.ckgsb.edu.cn/",2016-11-07,CkPEF5bEOBXf98u5jbt98L,"Robert Tercek, futurist and author of the book Vaporized, talks about how digital technology pushes us towards a software-defined society",competitor,02:41,No industry is immune from vaporization: Robert Tercek
-0.59,"Mumbai: The US-based stressed asset specialist Lone Star Funds has applied to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to set up an asset reconstruction company (ARC) with an eye on the massive bad loan-related opportunity in India, three people aware of the development said.
				   
				They have been scouting the Indian market for the last couple of months for stressed assets opportunities in the power and infrastructure sectors. As part of their strategy to tap this opportunity they have applied to RBI for setting up an ARC, said one of the three persons cited above, requesting anonymity as he is not authorized to speak to reporters.The ARC will be part of an India platform that Lone Star is looking to build, said the second person mentioned above. They are in the process of setting up a team to manage stressed infra assets in India. They are also looking to raise a new fund currently, a significant part of which will likely be dedicated to India, he added.Lone Star Funds declined to comment on the development. Lone Star is a global private equity firm that invests in real estate, equity, credit and other financial assets. Since the establishment of its first fund in 1995, Lone Star has raised 16 PE funds with aggregate capital commitments totalling over $65 billion, according to the funds website.Lone Star seeks opportunities in markets where liquidity is restricted and financing is constrained, where balance sheets of financial institutions are in stress and there is a need to dispose of high volumes of assets to manage capital, deleverage and build liquidity.Mint reported 19 October that Lone Star is in discussions with infrastructure conglomerate GMR Group to acquire a significant stake in GMR Chhattisgarh Energy Ltd, a unit of GMR Energy Ltd.With its plans to start an ARC, Lone Star joins the ranks of funds and financial services institutions that are looking to tap the huge bad loans mess that faces the Indian banking system. The gross bad loans of 39 listed Indian banks, in absolute terms, rose 92% in fiscal 2016 to Rs5.79 trillion.The Lone Star move comes after the government, seeking to resolve problem of mounting bad loans in Indias banking sector, decided in May to allow foreign institutions to fully own ARCs.Although local banks have trillions of rupees worth of bad loans on their books, the capital lying with existing ARCs in India is enough to buy only a fraction of the stressed assets available.Indias attempt to rid its banking sector of stressed assets is providing an opportunity for those with experience and the funds to turn around assets. Amongst those who have applied for setting up ARCs are global stressed asset specialist JC Flowers and Co., in partnership with Ambit Holdings Pvt. Ltd,  domestic financial services firm IIFL Holdings Ltd and Sudhir Valia, the former chief financial officer of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.Other global private equity funds, such as KKR and Co., Hong Kong-based SSG Capital Management and International Finance Corp. (IFC), the investment arm of the World Bank, have already acquired stakes in existing ARCs to buy bad loans.In January 2015, IFC invested in Encore Asset Reconstruction Co. Pvt. Ltd.  In March this year, the Foreign Investment Promotion Board gave approval to KKR & Co. for picking up a stake in International Asset Reconstruction Co. Pvt. Ltd.Most recently, ICICI Bank Ltd, State Bank of India (SBI) and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. announced plans to launch joint ventures to invest in stressed assets.In July, the countrys largest lender SBI tied up with Brookfield Asset Management Inc. to form a join venture fund for purchasing distressed assets. Brookfield has committed to invest Rs7,000 crore in the venture.In August, billionaire Ajay Piramal-led Piramal Enterprises Ltd said that it is launching a $1 billion-distressed asset investment platform in association with private equity fund Bain Capital Credit.Multiples Alternate Asset Management Pvt.

1.0,"London/New York: Wall Streets high-flyers in Davos, basking in their firms strong fourth-quarter earnings, said theyre confident Donald Trumps incoming administration will loosen regulatory constraints on financierseven if it leaves Barack Obamas signature Dodd-Frank Act largely intact.
				   
				Bank executives, speaking on condition of anonymity at events around the Swiss ski resort, said theyre not counting on Trump to overturn Dodd-Frank. Instead, they expect the federal agencies that enforce the rules to ease up on them and support bankers efforts to limit how much capital and liquidity their companies need to pay bills or absorb losses in a crisis.The bankers said they recognize that changing or overturning the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act would require support in the US Senate that Republicans may lack. Instead theyre counting on Trumps team to dial back how supervisory agencies enforce and interpret rules. Led by Federal Reserve governor Daniel Tarullo, US regulators have adopted an extra-strict version of the global standards on capital and liquidity set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.ALSO READ | A warning to Donald Trump from Friedrich HayekLegislation, obviously thats harder to do than just changing regulations, JPMorgan Chase & Co. chief executive officer Jamie Dimon said in a Bloomberg Television interview with John Micklethwait on Wednesday. Regulators can change a lot of things easily about compliance, about costs, certain rules about lending, how you use your liquidity, how you use your capital. I would like to see some of those looked at and maybe modified a bit, and I think it would be good for the economy.At a panel discussion on the global banking outlook in Davos Thursday morning, JPMorgan asset-management CEO Mary Callahan Erdoes echoed that view.Its going to be a great several years, Erdoes said. Its going to be very positive for businesses in the US, which should cascade to businesses around the world.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO Lloyd Blankfein offered a similarly optimistic view in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Davos on Thursday.If you look at the policies that Trump has committed himself to, they are quite stimulative and quite market-supportive, Blankfein said. If you look at spending on infrastructure, lower tax rate and overlapping regulation, they are quite stimulative, far more stimulative than what people were expecting had the Democrats won the election.The Goldman Sachs CEO also said theres an opportunity to re-legislate financial regulations as the US did with the Securities Exchange Act after the Great Depression.I think were going to open it up, Blankfein said. You can call it Dodd-Frank, as amended.ALSO READ | These automakers could be Donald Trumps next targetsWall Street bank shares, including JPMorgans and Goldman Sachss, have rallied since the election on speculation that Trumps policies will accelerate economic growth and drive higher interest rates.While Trumps transition team said after the election that it would work to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act and replace it with new policies to encourage economic growth and job creation, few bankers see Dodd-Frank as a priority. Even billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who Trump appointed as a special adviser last month to overhaul regulations, said in a CNN interview that he wouldnt support killing Dodd-Frank.Several bankers in Davos said theyre optimistic that regulators under Trump could do away with the gold-plating by the US of the latest Basel benchmarks and ease the process by which banks are stress-tested annually to ensure they have adequate capital to absorb losses in a hypothetical crisis.In Europe, where bankers argue the regions economic woes are exacerbated by the constraints on lenders, regulators have already helped delay agreement on a new set of global requirements.The Federal Reserve has led US rule-making efforts, including Basel implementation. Trump can appoint a vice-chairman for regulation, effectively replacing Tarullo, who has filled the role unofficially and antagonized bankers with his strict approach to regulation. That, along with other appointments, could help tip the Fed toward a more bank-friendly approach.ALSO READ | Wary of Donald Trump, China hails Obama for progress in Sino-US tiesIt also could be wishful thinking. While criticizing Dodd-Frank, Republican leaders in Congress have backed even higher capital requirements than the Fed for the largest banks. Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has proposed exempting banks from most other rules in exchange for 10% capital, almost twice as much as what big banks have now.New regulators could also change the way Dodd-Frank is implemented. One part bankers hate the most, the Volcker Rule, bans the largest firms from making speculative bets with their own money. Trumps Treasury secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, the Goldman Sachs co-president named to serve as Trumps chief economic policy adviser, are expected to be more sympathetic to banks arguments that limiting their trading hurts investors by making fixed-income securities less liquid.While trading revenue has declined in recent years, the Volcker Rule and other restrictions didnt prevent a jump last year, including at Goldman Sachs, where one trader made $250 million for his firm last year.JPMorgans Dimon and other executives also have pushed against international liquidity standards that were part of the post-crisis Basel regime and designed to ensure that firms have enough easy-to-sell assets to meet claims coming due in a month and over a year.Theres $2.5 trillion sitting at the central bank called excess reserves, Dimon said in Davos. And were not free to lend it because of all these new requirements.Asked whether laws will change or just how theyre enforced, Bank of America Corp. CEO Brian Moynihan told Erik Schatzker in Davos that I think it will be the implementation of regulation, adding later that he expects a regulatory debate about what the right regulation is and how it will be mitigated over time. Bloomberg",2017-01-19,Cm9YqAFaQZXGdngQqBvMEP,Wall Street bank shares have rallied since the election on speculation that Donald Trumps policies will accelerate economic growth and drive higher interest rates,company,22:06,Bankers in Davos see Donald Trump making Wall Street great again

Total standalone income of the company rose by 18% to Rs2,254 crore in July-September quarter this fiscal from Rs1,915 crore during the same period in 2015-16. Its total expenses were higher at Rs2,030 crore against Rs1,744 crore during the period under review. The firm announced that it will invest around Rs652 crore on capacity expansion. Shree Cement said it will set up a grinding unit in Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan with a capacity of 3.6 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) with an initial plan to set up a blending unit. The expansion will cost about Rs300 crore, which will come from internal accruals. The project is expected to be completed by April-June 2017-18, it added. The firm also revised its earlier expansion plan for the Bihar unit. Now, it will expand the existing capacity from 3.6 MTPA to 4.5 MTPA through installing blending equipment and de-bottlenecking with a cost of about Rs17 crore, which will be met through internal accruals. In August, Shree Cement had said it will expand capacity of its cement grinding unit at Aurangabad (Bihar) to 5.60 MTPA at a cost of around Rs285 crore.

-0.44,"Fertilizer stocks are back in the limelight. They gained in Mondays trade on speculation that the governments rural focus may help solve the sectors problems.
				   
				The primary issue afflicting the industrys growth is urea price control. The government makes good the production cost through subsidy, but unfortunately payments happen after long delays. Also under-allocation for subsidy requirement in earlier years means the budgeted amounts get exhausted in the first three quarters of the fiscal year.For instance, agricultural inputs manufacturer Coromandel International Ltd has received subsidy payment only till September. As of December, it has subsidy outstanding of Rs.1,582 crore, payment of which may happen only in the next fiscal year.The delay in payments is keeping the interest costs at elevated levels. Data compiled by rating agency Icra Ltd shows that interest expenses of 11 listed companies in the industry more than doubled in the last four years (between 2010-11 and 2014-15). During the period, key return ratios of these companies, such as return on capital employed and return on net worth, roughly halved.Pooling of natural gas and the recent softening of the spot market rates have helped alleviate working capital pressure. As a result, barring a few companies like Gujarat State Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd and Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers Ltd, interest costs at most companies did not rise significantly so far this fiscal year.But that provides no comfort. Prices of raw materials and fertilizers have fallen significantly in international markets, offering scope for subsidy cuts. Analysts expect the government to use this window to retain the overall subsidy amount at current levels and route the cost savings (on NPK grade or complex fertilizers) to clear pending subsidies. NPK is short for nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.This will not help the industry as it will widen the price gap between complex fertilizers and urea. The ideal step will be to rationalize urea prices, which will encourage balanced usage of fertilizers. But will the government bite the bullet? There is a pricing anomaly in the market with urea price being highly subsidized, leading to indiscriminate usage at the cost of NPK fertilizers, K. Ravichandran, senior vice-president and co-head-corporate sector ratings at Icra, said. While the government may resort to reduction in per unit subsidy on NPK nutrients in order to contain subsidy, farm gate price increase on urea remains to be seen with elections round the corner in five states, he added.",2016-02-23,CxQqNbBfv03REevFSeWnOO,"The primary issue afflicting the industrys growth is urea price control

-0.91,"New Delhi: After taking over the air (at least in urban India) and the airwavewith sexist advertising that claimed deodorants made men irresistible to womenIndias deodorant makers are now eyeing the perfume market. 
				   
				Deodorants are nothing to be sniffed at. They account for a Rs3,000 crore market in India. Now, the companies behind brands such as Fogg (Vini Cosmetics), Axe (Hindustan Unilever Ltd), and Engage (ITC Ltd), are looking at the branded mass fragrance market. Its a market theirs for the taking. Imported perfumes from luxury brands are usually priced between Rs3,000 and Rs5,000 which the masses cannot afford. Therefore, anybody looking to graduate from a deodorant has no affordable branded option. These brands are building a new category. It is a step towards premiumisation with offer better packaging and a higher price, said Rajat Wahi, partner and head (consumer markets), at consulting firm KPMG in India.Most companies have simply  chosen to extend their deodorant brands to the perfume segment. And, much like with their deodorants, their primary target is young men. Ahmedabad based Vini Cosmetics Ltd, the big daddy of the deodorant business, launched perfume sprays and gift packs last year. While the perfume bottles are priced at Rs499,  the gift packs range from Rs1,000 to Rs2,000. We are investing Rs30 to Rs40 crore in the perfume segment. Since perfume is also an occasional wear product in India we are positioning Fogg perfumes as value for money quality product which can also be gifted on special occasions, said Darshan Patel, founder, Vini Cosmetics. Perfumes contribute less than 10% to the companys overall revenue but Patel is confident that his products will gain a sizeable share in the Rs600 crore perfume market (both organized and unorganized).Like Fogg, HULs popular deodorant brand Axe has also launched premium fine fragrances under Axe Signature Gold range in December. Available in four variants, the Axe perfumes are priced at Rs450. Consumers are becoming more discerning and adding fine fragrances is increasingly becoming a part of their grooming regime. Our perfume range is targeted at young Indian men who are adding fine fragrances as a part of their grooming over and above the current deo usage, said an HUL spokesperson. ITC declined to participate in the story.With a slew of  launches, the companies are also spending big money on advertising although they declined to share their budgets. According to media agencies deodorant brands spend around Rs1, 000 to Rs1,500 crore on television advertising making every year. It is likely some of that money is now going to perfumes. I believe these brands have invested ahead of the curve first for deodorants and now perfumes. This category is heavily skewed towards sports, and news and English entertainment channels as they target young aspirational consumers. We will see a lot more activity in this segment, said Navin Khemka, managing partner, Maxus, a GroupM owned media agency.But the perfumes business may be tougher to crack than the deodorants one. Perfume launches in India havent worked so far.Deo brands have created brand equity by introducing cheaper and casual daily-wear products.

This is after a general examination of its systems in September 2016. That addressed some issues but the pending ones can be addressed only through a special audit, said one of the two persons cited above.ALSO READ | MCX remains a risky betThe terms of reference for the audit are along two broad themes. The first is to ensure that MCX is using the best available software and ascertain whether any undue influence  had been exerted on it to continue using FTIL software. Second, the regulator wants to determine if FTIL software has given any unfair advantage to trading members who use FTIL software for their own operations.A copy of Sebis letter to MCX has been reviewed by Mint. An email sent to Sebi was not answered.63 moons technologies (FTIL) had issued the licence for operating the said technology to MCX in 2003 and the same has been functioning perfectly till date. The regulator has sought MCX to conduct an audit of the system, hence we will not be able to respond on the same, said a spokesperson for FTIL in an emailed response.Sebi, in its letter to MCX, said the special audit should examine FTIL and MCX software for preferential access to members who use FTILs trading software ODIN.

FTIL sold its 26% stake in MCX in 2014, out of which a 15% stake was acquired by Kotak Mahindra Bank in July.MCX has already started to look for a forensic auditor and is expected to submit its report to the regulator by April, said the second person cited above. In December 2013, Forward Markets Commission (FMC), the former commodity markets regulator, ordered MCX to appoint a forensic auditor to scrutinize, among other things, related-party transactions.The auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), submitted its report to FMC and MCX in early 2014. But a detailed examination of FTILs software was not a part of the special audit.

0.34,"Deals in the infrastructure space are set to increase as companies put dozens of assets across roads and renewable energy sectors on sale, according to analysts and investment bankers. A number of such deals have either been announced or are in the due-diligence stage and will likely be completed in 2017. 
				   
				A number of infrastructure-focused funds and overseas pension funds have announced plans to invest in Indias roads and renewable energy projects.  Within infrastructure, roads is a sector where one will see deal activity improving, primarily because there are multiple operating assets available for a transaction that do not have construction risks involved and thus have better appeal to a financial investor. Also, there are multiple buying platforms emerging apart from the existing road platforms, as financial investors will also become acquirers of road assets via structures such as InvITs (infrastructure investment trusts). It is now a question of buyers and sellers expectations meeting at a certain valuation benchmark, said Navneet Singh, executive director and head, infrastructure group, Avendus Capital. ALSO READ: Indias solar prices set to drop amid competition, lower costsAlso, while deals in the thermal energy sector are expected to remain subdued due to the presence of only a handful of buyers, predominantly looking for operating assets, the renewable sector, primarily solar, will see activity in fund-raising as companies will continue to need additional capital to build their projects, Singh added. Several Indian infrastructure developers, weighed down by debt, have announced exits from individual highway projects to monetize assets and repay creditors while renewable energy firms evaluate fund-raises and going public.The infrastructure sector raised about $3.78 billion in 2016 across 36 transactions, including mergers and acquisitions (M&A), private equity (PE) investment and two initial public offerings (IPOs), analysis of monthly data from investment bank Equirus Capital Pvt. Ltd showed. This compares with $2.9 billion raised in 2014 and about $3.7 billion raised in 2015. According to data from Grant Thornton India, about $2.91 billion was raised from 39 M&A and PE transactions in 2016 across engineering, infrastructure, and clean-tech sectors.Funds such as US-based I Squared Capital, Indian asset manager IDFC Alternatives infrastructure fund, Canadas Brookfield Asset Management, Australias Macquarie Group, and the Canadian pension funds Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec (CDPQ) have committed large investments in the sector and are looking to buy assets across roads, thermal power and renewable energy to build their own portfolio in India. CDPQ, for example, had last year committed investments of $150 million for renewable energy in India and also joined hands with Tata Power Co. Ltd and ICICI Venture to launch a platform to facilitate investments in power projects with an initial capital of up to $850 million. Infrastructure Fund II of multi-asset manager IDFC Alternatives, for example, plans to buy certain operational road assets by March. A number of deals in the sector have been signed or announced over the last 12 months but many are yet to close. One noticeable trend seen is that closing and funding control acquisitions require significantly higher involvement and patience than buying simple passive minority stakes, said Aditya Aggarwal, partner (infrastructure) at IDFC Alternatives. Going forward, I would expect a lot more mid-sized M&A activity in renewables given that significant solar capacity would get commissioned from the equity lock-in restrictions in 2017. Likewise, I expect the TOT (toll-operate-transfer) model to be a game changer in road sector investments this year, Aggarwal said. The government is looking to monetize 75 national highways operated by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) through international competitive bidding under the so-called TOT model, where investors including foreign funds will participate. ALSO READ: Centre calls national review meet to push clean energy projectsSimilarly, road developers including Sadbhav Infrastructure Projects Ltd and Gayatri Projects Ltd are looking for buyers for some of their operational assets. Hyderabad-based Gayatri Projects is carrying out the process of demerging its roads assets into a separate entity to bring in a financial partner or look at selling the portfolio either entirely or as individual assets to foreign funds, managing director T.V.

0.24,"Public sector banks have been blamed for the unprecedented pile-up of bad loans since the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) ordered a clean-up of books last year. Indeed, the quarterly results that followed the clean-up showed government banks held the most toxic assets. Their private-sector counterparts were hailed for their high asset quality.
				   
				But the September quarter results show private-sector lenders, at least some of them, are as deep in troubled waters as their public sector peers. At the aggregate level, private-sector banks saw bad loan stock double on a gross basis to Rs66,314 crore and provisions treble to Rs1.2 trillion from a year ago. For the public sector group, the surge in bad loan stock was similar, but provisions rose only 49%. This could mean private-sector lenders were slow in recognizing distressed assets and making provisions. The casualties were Axis Bank Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd, Yes Bank Ltd and South Indian Bank.Axis Bank saw a significant portion of loans on its watchlist turn bad, provisions climbed fivefold and the provision coverage ratio dropped to 60% from 72% in the March quarter. At ICICI Bank, gross bad loans doubled and it had to provide Rs7,082.69 crore for them. Yes Bank and South Indian Bank also posted weak asset quality metrics.But the real worry is these private-sector lenders net non-performing assets (NPA). The accretion in net NPAs for these lenders was far higher than that of gross NPAs. This means upgrades and recoveries are slowing even as fresh slippages are showing no signs of abatement. On an aggregate basis, private-sector banks net NPA stock jumped 132% while that of the public sector banks surged a shade lower by 103%.Private banks have always been perceived to be more efficient and having a firm hand on errant borrowers. But the net NPA accretion shows they are no better than their public sector counterparts.Granted, public sector lenders are still the worst lot but it is time that private-sector banks, especially corporate lenders, are valued more realistically.

0.49,"When Dell Inc. said it would acquire EMC Corp. for $67 billion last October, analysts were sceptical since both companies primarily sold commoditised products like personal computers (PCs), servers and storage in a world where clients had begun demanding solutions aimed at digital transformation.
				   
				On Wednesday, Alok Ohrie, president and MD, India Commercial of Dell EMC, insisted that the combined company, christened Dell Technologies, is now uniquely positioned to provide customers with solutions that will secure their digital future with a single window of engagement. The combination creates a $74 billion company with a technology portfolio which  includes virtualization company VMware, security firms RSA Systems and SecureWorks, software and services (including cloud and big data analytics) firm Pivotal, and cloud management software company Virtustream.In an interview, Ohrie said he believes there are three pillars of digital transformation: IT infrastructure transformation, workforce transformation and security transformation. Effectively, we now play in all the elements of a modern data centre, he said.Dell doesnt break up country-wise revenue, but according to estimates by Dataquest, a Cyber Media (India) Ltd Publication, Dell Indias revenue stood at Rs17,480 crore in FY 2015-16. It pegged EMC Indias revenue in 2014-15 at Rs2,452 crore (combined about Rs20,000 crore, or $3 billion).Tom Sweet, chief financial officer, Dell Technologies, recently said that the combined revenue of the two companies in India was closer to $2.5 billion.According to International Data Corp. (IDC), in the overall PC shipment for the April-June quarter of 2016, HP Inc. reclaimed its top spot with 28.4% market share, while Dell captured the second spot with 22.2% backed by focused efforts on growing branded consumer desktop category.In the India x86 (Intel-based servers) market, HP maintained its lead position in the October-December quarter of 2015 with 36% market share in terms of unit shipment, followed by Dell with a market share of 24% and Lenovo with 12%. EMC led in Indias external storage industry with a 28.4% market share in the January quarter.Nevertheless, the fact is that the shift to cloud is transforming and cannibalizing hardware markets, and technology companies, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), Oracle Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc.,  need to evolve their strategies in order to survive, according to Forrester analysts.Ohrie pointed out that Dell Technologies, with 140,000 employees, annual revenue of $74 billion and over 20,000 patents and patent applications, has over the last few years made significant investments in R&D that will stand it in good stead.Dell and EMC have made a cumulative R&D investment of $12.7 billion over the last three years and we have publicly stated that for this year, $4.5 billion of investment will be made in R&D, which is multiple times what the competition is investing, Ohrie said. Going forward, Ohrie said, we are going to focus on the digital transformation space and help our customers take that journey at a faster pace.But what will happen to jobs made redundant by the Dell-EMC merger?

-0.45,"Mumbai: Samsung Electronics Co on Friday offered alternative phones to its India customers who had pre-ordered its flagship Galaxy Note 7 devices, in a bid to appease loyal clients in one of its largest smartphone markets. 
				   
				The worlds largest phone maker has been hit by an avalanche of negative publicity, after being forced to recall millions of the fire-prone Note 7 devices and later scrap the high-end phone altogether.India is one of the worlds largest and fastest growing smartphone markets and a critical one for Samsung as it is the No. 1 player in the nation with a roughly 25% market share. The device that had been set to go on sale in India in early September ended up not getting to any Indian customers after it failed to resolve overheating problems which caused some of the phones to ignite.The company initially apologised to customers for the delay in the Note 7, and in a release late on Friday it said for those who had pre-booked devices, in lieu of the Note 7 it would offer customers either its Galaxy S7, or S7 Edge devices.It also offered affected clients a free set of its virtual reality headsets, a free pair of wireless headphones, a voucher worth about $50, along with a free one-time screen replacement in case of any damage to the new smartphone within a year.In a separate statement Samsung also questioned analyst estimates on the extent of the impact on revenue in India from the Note 7 debacle. We can confirm that contrary to these reports, we are headed for record sales of mobile phones this year, the company said in the statement.Earlier on Friday, Samsung said however that it expected to take a hit to its operating profit of about $3 billion over the next two quarters due to the discontinuation of the Galaxy Note 7.

-0.0,"This month marks the 25th anniversary of Indias big bang economic reforms. This newspaper and many others have recounted the turbulent times preceding July 1991. The backdrop was a succession of unstable governments with a rapidly deteriorating macroeconomy and the commencement of the first Gulf war leading to a spurt in oil prices. There was great drama too, with secret airlifting of Indias sovereign gold to pledge as collateral for an emergency foreign loan.
				   
				Even though 1991 is the marker, it is fair to say that reformist thinking was evident even in the mid-1980s. For instance, there were trade reforms (easing of capital goods imports), financial sector reforms (abolition of control of capital issues) and several other smaller reform measures in the administration and running of the public sector. This prior incremental journey has been forgotten because it was overtaken by the tumultuous events of 1990 and 1991.It is also clear by now that support for the reforms process was sprinkled across different ministries. Some well-known bureaucrats (now acclaimed as the architects of Indias reforms) occupied key positions in the economic ministries and the Prime Ministers Office and saw eye-to-eye on what was needed to be done. Their synergy and collective intellect provided the force for the reforms roll-out. The political cover ultimately came from prime minister Narasimha Rao, whose leadership was crucial for the success of the reforms. Rao managed to obtain key cabinet decisions and consensus without the advantage of a mechanism like the group of ministers, used extensively by his successors.By far the biggest reform of 1991 was industrial delicensing. In one swoop the licence-permit raj was dismantled, eliminating the need for permission to set up a new factory, or indeed even to add capacity to an existing factory. It is true that cement decontrol had commenced earlier in 1989, but an order affecting Indias entire industrial sector was 1991s big move. Interestingly, this particular reform was announced by the then industries minister in the forenoon of 24 July 1991the same day that finance minister Manmohan Singh gave his historic budget speech. The next days jubilant headlines missed out that crucial detail, that the licence raj had been demolished by the industries minister, who was none other than the prime minister himself.The dismantling of the suffocating licensing regime was supposed to unleash the industrial sector in a big way. Just like our East Asian peers, we should have seen a jump in the share of manufacturing in national gross domestic product (GDP). Unfortunately this promise was never fulfilled. The share of manufacturing was 16.41% in 1989-90 and is 16.2% in 2015-16 (new GDP series). If anything, it has fallen just a bit. This is a big puzzle. Additionally, even employment in the organized manufacturing sector, especially the public sector, has remained stagnant. It is true that in real terms GDP has quadrupled, which means industrial production too is four times bigger (since its share has remained constant). But it should have galloped and increased its share. The National Manufacturing Policy (NMP) aims to increase the share from the current level to 25% in the next seven years. This seems almost impossible in light of the experience of the past 25 years. The reasons for the stagnation could be many: excessive tax burden, inadequate infrastructure and connectivity, unreliable electricity, non-availability of credit or appropriately skilled labour, lack of research, development or technology adoption and so on.One of the members of the 1991 reforms team and former Reserve Bank of India deputy governor Rakesh Mohan also pointed out another troubling feature. This is manifest in Indias trade balance. If you take out the 6-7% earnings from remittances and software exports, and add 1-2% as healthy current account deficit for a growing economy like India, then our merchandise trade balance is a negative 8-9% of GDP. This is largely the shortage of industrial goods in the country. This gap reflects our inability to service our domestic market in a variety of industrial sectors, from electronics and cellphones to capital goods and machinery. Foreign imports, superior in quality and cheaper (thanks to an overvalued exchange rate), manage to swamp our markets and harness our purchasing power. E-commerce companies are probably sourcing the bulk of their merchandise through imports anyway. According to a Ficci study, the logistics cost component can be as high as 17% of the domestic cost of industrial production. (This includes the ad hoc entry taxes arbitrarily slapped on interstate movement of goods).The NMP document of 2013 already has the blueprint of what needs to be done. Initiatives like Make in India and Mudra Bank loans to small and medium entrepreneurs, the nationwide roll-out of the goods and services tax, easing of power shortagesall will cumulatively give a fillip to industrial production. But as we deal with and solve the problems of yesterday, the challenges of tomorrow are already at our doorstep. This means dealing with the rise of robotics, 3-D printing, vastly diffused and distributed value chains across countries and falling trade barriers thanks to free trade agreements. Raising the share of manufacturing in GDP: this is a hard nut to crack, but crack it we must.Ajit Ranade is chief economist at Aditya Birla Group.

				Lately its been gored by Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries Ltd., whose mobile carrier Jio is literally giving away services and has quickly grabbed 70 million customers.That Vodafone is in talks to combine its Indian business with Idea Cellular Ltd is at least a sign that something can be done to cut the British companys exposure to the country. Vodafone is discussing an all-share deal with Idea that would see it de-consolidate the business in its accounts. ALSO READ | Vodafone confirms Idea merger talks, could create Indias biggest telecom firmCombining the market number two Vodafone with third-placed Idea would create a new market leader ahead of Bharti Airtel Ltd, putting it in a better position to survive Ambanis onslaught. It would have about 390 million customers and about 40% market share by revenue before any antitrust concessions.To try to make the numbers work in an all-share deal, the proposal excludes Vodafones 42% share of an Indian towers company called Indus, worth about $4 billion. That brings the value of the Vodafone mobile business closer to Ideas market capitalization, which jumped more than 25% to $5.2 billion on Monday (from $4.1 billion).If a deal is finalized, Vodafone could then sell down its stake in the merged company over time, hopefully at a better price if its better able to withstand the heat from Jio. There will be synergies too from combining operational and capital spending.ALSO READ | Ideas shares surge on Vodafone merger talks, so do AirtelsPlus Vodafone still has the option of selling its Indus shares to Bharti, which owns 42% of the joint venture, according to Bernsteins Dhananjay Mirchandani.If Vodafone boss Vittorio Colao can engineer those twin moves in India, shareholders would probably accept a reasonable retreat from a painful situation.

-0.22,"Mumbai: As the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) delays releasing guidelines for the so-called S4A (sustainable structuring of stressed assets) scheme, lenders to some of Indias most debt-ridden companies are keeping those accounts on standby.  
				   
				According to three bankers with knowledge of the matter, creditors of textile maker Alok Industries Ltd and Bhushan Steel Ltd have evaluated the books of these companies and are waiting for RBI to clear the path ahead for them to implement S4A.  As of March 2016, Bhushan Steel had consolidated debt of Rs44,477.93 crore and Alok Industries Rs22,075.15 crore.RBI introduced the S4A scheme in June, allowing banks to convert as much as half the loans held by corporate borrowers into equity or equity-like securities. The move was intended to help restore the flow of credit to crucial sectors such as infrastructure and iron and steel, among others, reduce the stress on corporate borrowers and stanch bad loans across banks.In case of Alok Industries, the evaluation study has established that less than half of the companys debt is actually sustainable. We are expecting RBI to give some leeway in the structuring of the guidelines, so this case might benefit from the restructuring, said a senior official at a state-run bank, with direct knowledge of the case. The banker spoke on condition of anonymity as the discussions are confidential.  Lenders to Alok Industries decided on a strategic debt restructuring (SDR) of the company in November 2015, the company had said in a stock exchange notification. Under this scheme, lenders would be allowed to convert part of the debt in a company to majority equity, thereby taking over operational control. In January, it said lenders planned to acquire 65% of the company by converting debt to equity under SDR.  The S4A option was considered after lenders failed to find a suitable buyer for the company.In the case of Bhushan Steel, the lending consortium led by State Bank of India (SBI) and Punjab National Bank (PNB) has conducted a forensic audit, but hasnt moved ahead on the case since it is waiting for the final S4A guidelines, said the deputy managing director of a large state-owned bank, also on conditions of anonymity.  In January-March, lenders to Bhushan Steel started classifying the account as a non-performing asset under RBIs asset quality review. This was done after efforts for debt resolution such as joint lender forum (JLF) discussions and the 5/25 refinancing plan, which allows banks to extend the tenure of infrastructure loans, failed. The JLF was set up after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested Neeraj Singhal, vice-chairman at Bhushan Steel, in the cash-for-loans case in 2014. At the monetary policy announcement on 4 October, RBI governor Urjit Patel said the regulator would announce reworked guidelines around the S4A restructuring scheme by the end of that month. The regulator had said that it was looking at changing certain aspects of the guidelines which might come in the way of practical application, such as allowing banks to classify so-called sustainable debt as a standard account. The final guidelines are yet to emerge.  There is a time component to turning around stressed assets. These cases have already seen a lot of delay in the reworking of their debt, things need to move fast now, said the second banker cited above. Alok Industries and RBI did not respond to queries mailed to them. A spokesperson for Bhushan Steel did not respond to messages sent to his cell phone.The regulator's delay in issuing revised guidelines points at RBIs need for making S4A a more inclusive restructuring mechanism. While the banking regulator does not want to seem like it is being too easy on restructuring cases, it does want to bring in more cases under S4A, the managing partner of a stressed asset consulting firm said on conditions of anonymity.Others say delays in restructuring are also a function of banks inertia.""Regulatory delays are one thing, but lenders are also not really willing to take tough calls in difficult situations. Most public sector banks seem to be too scared of vigilance-related investigations, which acts as a deterrent when they have to decide on taking big haircuts during such turnaround cases, the head of the restructuring practice at a global consulting firm said, also seeking anonymity.According to the S4A norms issued by the central bank in June, banks are allowed to split the debt of a stressed company into sustainable and unsustainable parts.  According to RBI norms, the unsustainable debt can be converted into long-term, equity-like instruments that will be on a banks investment books while the rest of the debt can be restructured.Under S4A norms, promoters will be required to dilute their shareholding in exchange for converting a part of the unsustainable debt into equity. These promoters shares would be given to banks, which will continue to hold them till a company turns around, after which lenders can sell the equity.  Promoters will continue to have the first right of refusal to these shares.  Most other restructuring options on offer have not delivered satisfactory results, resulting in higher accumulation of bad loans on the books of banks, which collectively hold Rs6.3 trillion of non-performing assets.",2016-11-07,EJzIYX2yzAzPfPgv2Dg8DJ,The creditors of Alok Industries and Bhushan Steel are waiting for RBI to issue fresh guidelines,company,00:49,Lenders put top NPA cases on standby over S4A norms delay

				The firm is well poised in the power transmission and distribution (T&D) segment, where fresh orders have been robust since January and its likely to see 10% growth in order inflows.With this, its order book is likely to be a little over one years revenue. This is good news, given that KEC has been able to buck the slowdown. Most capital goods manufacturers are languishing because of a lack of orders, as industrial capex looks distant.The management is hopeful of doubling its order book in railways from Rs900 crore now by FY17 end. Analysts are confident of the order book improving over the next two years on strong orders from Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd, state electricity boards and also international markets.Meanwhile, its venture into solar projects, water projects, substations and railways will bring in benefits of diversification through new growth areas, thereby strengthening KECs stock valuation.This is not all. The capital goods equipment makers consolidated profitability is likely to get a leg-up from its overseas subsidiary, SAE Towers, that has started generating cash profits after suffering losses for several quarters after it was acquired in 2010. This entity has helped KEC gain a footprint in North and South America, Canada, Brazil and Mexico.Further, profitability will improve in the near term as earlier low-margin legacy projects are nearing completion.Commodity costs are benign, too. The benefits of operating leverage will kick in with higher execution on the back of robust orders.However, investors must be aware that any change in the T&D business prospects in India or overseas can affect the firms revenue model and, thereby, profit growth, too.Also, high competition can gradually erode profit margins. In fact, the stock had reacted adversely a few months ago when the overseas business was a drag on KECs overall profitability.Since then, the stock has been underperforming the BSE capital goods index, trading at about 12 times the FY17 earnings per share.But now, the favourable winds of robust orders and execution are paving the way for a robust double-digit growth in earnings per share over the next two years.

				When the Chinese appliance maker Midea Group announced a bid for the German robotics manufacturer Kuka AG this spring, it seemed like something of an omen. Kuka makes robots that specialize in assembling goods on a factory floorexactly the kind of work that has lifted millions of Chinese out of poverty.After opening up to the world in 1979, China focused on tapping its vast pool of cheap labour. From T-shirts to Christmas ornaments, Chinese manufacturers could undersell the world on most any basic product simply by drafting another migrant farmer into a factory. Investment flooded into Chinese cities. The factories got bigger, better and more advanced. Wages rose, poverty fell, and a middle class emerged and quickly expanded.This was a well-worn path of development. Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea all advanced in much the same way. Today, many developing countries are still counting on this model. The problem is that robotics may fundamentally upend it.Even as global growth slowed, industrial robot sales grew 12% between 2014 and 2015, and have grown fourfold since 2009. As robots get cheaper and better, the advantage of employing a low-skilled labourer starts to fade. Even a lowly sweatshop worker will struggle to compete with a robots productivity, not to mention its low rates of error and other advantages.In other words, where poorer countries could once use their cost advantage to lure manufacturers, now all cost advantages are disappearing in the robotics age. A robot costs the same to employ whether in China, the US or Madagascar. Rich countries are repatriating the production of everything from apparel to electronics. Wal-Mart wants to re-shore the manufacture of $50 billion worth of goods over the next 10 years, relying on increased speed and lower costs as key competitive advantages.The implications of this shift shouldnt be underestimated. The days of international trade growing at near double-digit rates might be over. Trade has historically grown at twice the rate of gross domestic product, but in the past few years it has stagnated, leaving it 15% lower than would be expected, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. It may well have permanently stagnated.In this new reality, development plans for poorer countries will have to be rewritten. But it isnt clear how to do so.One step could be investing in leapfrog technology. Mobile phones are the much-cited example. Thanks to cellular, poorer countries have been able to reap all the advantages that phones brought without the expense of laying land lines. In the digital age, its possible that other technologies could prove similarly transformative. China has become the largest buyer of industrial robots in the hopes that they will help manufacturers make the leap to advanced electronics.But such technology wont do much good without a skilled workforce. A factory of robots will require minimal low-skilled labour, but it will need engineers and computer scientists. Investing in educationnot just coding skills, but the ability to shift seamlessly between products and to create new products faster than competitorswill be critical. Developing countries should also consider programmes to attract skilled labour. China and India, among others, have set up offices to lure home educated workers who have left for richer countries.Finally, countries trying to boost growth could improve governance and domestic policies. If trade is less important, they will need to encourage direct investment flows. If skilled workers are in demand, they will need to relax labour policies to attract educated migrants. And if ideas are more important than ever, they will need to make life easier for entrepreneurs.None of that is easy. And it may not even prove up to the challenge. But the robots are coming, one way or another. Developing countries are the least prepared for that shiftand have the most to lose. BLOOMBERG

				Essel Infraprojects roads subsidiary Essel Highways Ltd has been looking to expand its portfolio of road projects by way of acquisitions. In August, Essel Highways had secured $85 million loan from investment bank Goldman Sachs as part of a $220-million debenture issuance to finance new projects and for strategic acquisitions. Patel Engineering and KNR Constructions will sell their entire equity stake in two annuity-based BOT projects, namely Patel KNR Infrastructure Ltd (PKIL) and Patel KNR Heavy Infrastructure Ltd (PKHIL) to the Essel group company, KNR Constructions said in a BSE filing on Saturday.Patel Engineering and affiliates hold about 60% stake in each of the two assets, while the remaining 40% is with KNR. The two projects have a combined debt of about Rs.780 crore, a person familiar with the projects said. KNR Constructions plans to focus on its EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) business by exiting the asset-heavy BOT business, while the sale will help Patel Engineering improve its financial liquidity. Several road companies are going back to the EPC model, where investments and risks are lower and are beginning to demerge or monetize their operational BOT assets. Investment bank Equirus Capital acted as the exclusive transaction advisors to KNR Constructions and Patel Engineering. Both the assets are operational on the annuity-based model and were awarded by the national Highways Authority of India (NHAI), the statement said adding that the transaction is subject to certain conditions precedent including lenders and NHAI approvals. The deal is likely to close in the next two-three months time. The transaction is in line with the trend seen across the roads sector where institutional money is chasing operational cash-flows and helping in debt reduction of infrastructure conglomerates, said Ajay Garg, managing director of Equirus Capital. Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas acted as the legal advisors to the two sellers while Luthra and Luthra law offices advised Essel on this transaction.

-0.17,"The goods and services tax (GST) will undoubtedly give India a facelift on the taxation front. Of course, the suspense over the rate at which GST will be levied remains.
				   
				While it is difficult to quantify the impact on various sectors until the government announces the final GST rate, analysts and economists are assuming a standard rate of 17-18%.If that happens, then companies in the manufacturing sector are expected to benefit, while those in the services sector stand to lose.Also read: GST: The road ahead for industry

Of course, even though the bill has been passed in the current session, it will be another couple of years until GST is fully rolled out. As such, its premature to conclude how this reform will impact stock prices in the near term. In any case, there are various other factors that impact stock prices, and while GST is an important reform, analysts are more keen about indicators of the economic recovery.The winners 
1) Automobiles: The auto sector is likely to emerge as a winner from GST implementation, provided the rate is below the total tax incidence for the sector (>27%). GST is expected to lead to lower prices for the end user and thus boost demand. Companies to benefit include Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. Both stocks have outperformed the market so far this fiscal year. Analysts believe some impact of GST could well be priced in at current levels.2) Multiplexes: Multiplex companies pay around 25% of the average revenue per user (average ticket price + food and beverage spends, or F&B per head) as taxes, according to Kotak Institutional Equities. This is in three broad areas(a) entertainment tax on net ticket sales, (b) Value-added tax (VAT) on F&B, and (c) service tax on input costs for which there is no set-off available. No wonder, GST is expected to reduce the tax burden and improve the Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin. Stocks of PVR Ltd and Inox Leisure Ltd have increased 50% and 30%, respectively, so far in FY17, suggesting the shares are factoring in most of the positives. Of course, there are other factors that are driving these shares.3) FMCG: If the GST rate is less than or equal to 18%, then it should be positive for most consumer goods companies, point out analysts at Citigroup. Of course, much depends on which exemptions are retained and which of the current excise benefits are grandfathered. In addition, there will be gains from warehouse rationalization and a better competitive position vis-à-vis unorganized firms. But gains arent expected to be massive and will occur gradually; as such, stocks may not react dramatically just because the GST bill is passed.If cigarettes attract a higher tax incidence under the GST regime, then it will have an adverse impact on companies such as ITC Ltd.4) Logistics: Supply chain management is expected to get a boost and transit time will reduce. Further, interstate trade barriers would reduce and eventually result in better interstate commerce. Consolidation of warehousing facilities is expected. Stocks that may benefit include Container Corp. of India Ltd and Transport Corp. of India Ltd. Citis analysts point out that the better operating environment could lead Gateway Distriparks Ltd to enter the domestic business.5) Cement: The anticipated 18% GST rate is far lower than what cement companies are paying currently, and analysts expect cement makers to pass on the benefits to consumers as demand continues to remain weak. Whether this alone will help revive demand is another matter altogether.6) Retail: The opportunity to set off input tax credit on rent is expected to aid margin expansion. But retail companies are facing other problems. Shoppers Stop Ltds stock has underperformed the benchmark Sensex this year, as underlying demand remains weak and like-to-like sales growth has been lacklustre.Also read: GST reforms: Are companies prepared?

The losers
As mentioned earlier, services-related sectors are expected to be negatively impacted, as they may have to shell out higher taxes than what they are currently paying. Service tax rate is currently at about 15%.1) Telecom: The moderate rise in tax outgo could hit demand and revenues. But there would be a simultaneous set-off of taxes (Cenvat, or central VAT) paid on certain capex inputs. So, the impact would be marginal. But telcos have bigger problems. Data volumes are slowing and the Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd launch can worsen matters.2) Consumer staples and discretionary: Many consumer staples currently have low indirect tax. Hence, GST will be negative for companies in food processing, bakery, edible oil, dairy segments and personal care items. Quick service restaurants too will be adversely impacted. Kotak Institutional Equities sees some impact on Britannia Industries Ltd and ITC.

				The latest scuffle reached a crescendo on Monday after LeEcos chairman and co-founder Jia Yueting admitted last week that his sprawling empire may be struggling just a little. Going by the dictionary definition, sprawling is precisely what his business has been doing.It all started about a dozen years ago when Jia got the idea to start a streaming video service, dubbed LeTV. While its often called the Netflix of China, the moniker should be swappedJias business got going when the US company was still shipping DVDs, so Netflix is more correctly the LeTV of America.But streaming wasnt enough for Jia, so he broadened out to create LeEco. Along with device maker Coolpad, which he also chairs, the plan was to build out an ecosystem that included TVs, tablets and smartphones. And cars, but more on that later. The unsustainability of this enterprise led to his written confession:We blindly sped ahead, and our cash demand ballooned. We got over-extended in our global strategy. At the same time, our capital and resources were in fact limited.:So you have a Chinese technology guy trying to build an ecosystem linking software and content to hardware and devices. Needing money to build out his grand plan, he raises funds since his core business barely generates enough cash to keep things going. Sound familiar?Slinging mud at LeEcoaccording to reports by Bloomberg News, the Beijing Times and othersis Xiaomi founder Lei Jun. Taking to WeChat, Lei cast aspersions on LeEcos debt and its ability to pay. The two traded barbs on social media before the head of LeEcos North American operations, Brian Hui, went on stage at the TechCrunch Beijing forum on Tuesday where he clarified Jias original letter.Its not about running out of money. Its how you can spend your money wisely, Hui told moderator . Which brings me back to the question of how the heck a streaming video company got into high-performance electric cars.The goal of Jias automaking venture, Faraday Future, is to usher in the next generation of premium, hyper-connected electric vehicles in the next few years. To get there its hired 1,400 people and has already burned through 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) in early development. You can turn to its website for an explanation of how this fits in to the LeEco vision, but let me save you some time: It doesnt.Luckily for investors in Jias publicly traded businessesLeshi Internet Information & Technology Corp. and Coolpad Group Ltdmost of the cash burn for these hobby projects hasnt been coming out of company funds. Unluckily, that hasnt stopped them churning through cash of their own accord. Instead, Bloombergs David Ramli writes, Jia uses shares in those companies as collateral against loans going into his moonshot projects.Faraday futures spending so far is $1.5 billion.If one day there is a reckoning, smart investors will be diving deep into the books of Leshi and Coolpad. The same can be said for all number of technology players in China who are rushing headlong into building out ecosystems, relying on continued rounds of funding to hide the fact that their fundamental business might not be sustainable and such synergies are more myth than reality.Mudslingers take note: If Jia has one thing going for him, its the fact that the first step to fixing a problem is admitting that you have one.

0.09,"If demonetisation has affected steel-consuming sectors such as automobile and construction/real estate, how come steel consumption is rising?
				   
				In December, steel consumption rose by 5.2% over a year ago and by 17.1% over November, according to data collated by the governments Joint Plant Committee (JPC). In November too, consumption was up by 3.8%, although it did decline sequentially. Specific factors appear to be behind this increase and the underlying demand for steel remains weak.Consumption data reported by JPC represents sales made by steel producers to buyers such as steel dealerswho then sell to actual consumersand large companies such as in the automobile or projects sectors.In December, the purchasing teams of large consumers of steel got wind that steel companies will be increasing prices January onwards, said Puneet Paliwal, consultant at research and consultancy firm CRU Group. Higher input costs, especially of coking coal, had led to talk of price increases. Large consumers of steel bought additional quantities in December to build stocks for future use, which explains the sharp increase.In November, the increase although relatively slower, was seen due to dealers stocking up steel while they could use their stock of demonetised currency, according to Vivek Jain, associate director (large corporates) at India Ratings and Research Pvt. Ltd. They have stocked up on additional inventory, to be sold in future months.Firms have announced a hike in flat steel prices in January, as predicted, but maintaining higher prices will be tough. Steel mills have purchased raw materials at high prices, but the market may be unable to absorb higher steel prices, says Paliwal. Underlying demand conditions are weak, due to demonetisation. The export market, too, is not supporting higher realizations and it may get tougher when the Chinese New Year holidays see more exports from China as local activity ebbs.If both dealers and companies have stocked up on inventory and demand is not robust, things may get tougher. The coming months may, therefore, see reported consumption growth under some strain, till the surplus steel already in the market gets absorbed. A quick revival in demand in user sectors could do the trick as well, although thats an idle hope at this point. Steel producers may, therefore, have to decide between exporting more or cut back on output. Analysts are predicting the latter.Meanwhile, the December quarter results of large steel companies may show a surge in sales based on JPC data. Tata Steel Ltds December quarter saleable steel output rose by 25.8% over a year ago while sales rose by 27.5%, partly due to volumes from its new plant. JSW Steel Ltd reported a 43% year-on-year increase in crude steel output. While the headline financials should look good, based on these numbers, investors should pay more attention to what managers say about real steel demand conditions in the domestic market.",2017-01-10,EopbIW2tqkzskW9sq15CdI,"If both dealers and companies have stocked up on inventory and demand is not robust, things may get tougher",competitor,07:50,Why is Indias steel consumption rising?
-0.47,"Its unusual to see Tata Steels European business report an increase in profits, while the India business reports a decline. In the September quarter, Europes profit rose by 20.8% sequentially while Indias profit fell by 10.6%. Indias profit declined over a year ago too.
				   
				The commissioning of Tata Steels new Kalinganagar (Odisha) plant has meant output is higher but the start-up costs are affecting profits. Initially, the output is of lower grade while the cost of production is higher. Also, lower prices of long products were a reason for the poor performance.The companys European business did better on the back of better prices, leading to better spreads, with improvement visible in both the UK and Netherlands. The sale of its long products business too has meant that the product mix was more favourable in the quarter. Profit improved although output was lower.Overall, total sales rose by 4.5% sequentially and Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) declined by 8.4%, chiefly because raw material costs rose by 14.9% and other expenses rose by 5.9%. The Kalinganagar plants start has also meant higher interest and depreciation charges. That further whittled down its profit, and resulted in a sharp 75.6% decline in its profit before tax. An improvement in its European business profitability, which was visible in the first quarter too, is good news. Iron ore prices are sustaining a firm trend in steel prices.

0.24,"Paris: Facebook and Google are the 800-pound gorillas in online advertising because of audience reach and superior targeting. They enjoy another lesser-known advantage: theyre largely immune to ad blocking.
				   
				People install ad blockers to strip out marketing messages and the trackers used to target ads. Theyre more widespread on computers but theyre migrating slowly to mobile too. Analysts estimate that ad blocking cost web publishers nearly $22 billion in lost ad sales last year, compared with total internet ad sales of $160 billion.Yet its becoming clear that the pain isnt being shared equally, and this is more bad news for newspaper, magazine, and television companies. What started as a consumer movement sparked by rage about intrusive ads, security and privacy seems to be strengthening the internets big beasts.Not only does old world media lack the tech chops to beat the blockers, their fragile finances make it hard to turn away ad dollars in the name of user experience. Google and Facebooks resources dwarf the legacy publishers. But even when looked at on a proportional basis, old medias investment in its own future is anemic. Last year, Google spent 16.4% of revenue on R&D, according to Bloomberg data, and Facebook almost a quarter. At Daily Mail & General Trust, owner of one of the most popular news sites, it was 3.6%.Facebook is a textbook example of how technology enshrines advantage. While it was prey to ad blockers when most users preferred computers, its played a blinder in the shift to mobile. The ads within the mobile Facebook app (and its photo-sharing app Instagram) cant be stripped out by blockers. Theyre delivered by Facebook servers with none of the usual identifiers.Googles main defence is its iron grip on search ads. These paid-for links, which appear by results when users look for information on plane fares or movie tickets, arent as annoying as pop-up ads or videos. One caveat: Googles display advertising, such as banner ads or videos on YouTube, is more threatened by ad blockers than Facebooks. Unlike the social media giant, Google ads arent sheltered within an app.Yet this is small comfort for traditional media. Once ad blocking usage hits about 20% of the population, it really starts to hurt publishers, according to John Montgomery of WPPs GroupM. The New York Times and others are desperate for online ads to make up the shortfall from print, but its hard going as the chart below shows. Falling prices for their online ads, which cannot match the targeting precision of Facebook or Google, are the main culprit, but ad blockers arent helping.Since most publishers rely on external networks to sell their online ad space, the ads are easily identified and cut out by blockers. Efforts to coax people to turn off the blockers are becoming common, but have yet to prove effective. Blocking increases pressure on free sites such as the Daily Mail and Guardian to impose paywalls. But its tough to sell general news, which is freely available elsewhere.One answer could be to turn to the web giants for help. A year ago, Facebook created a tool that hosts publishers content within the social network, theoretically taking them off the ad blockers radars too. Google has a similar initiative.Yet such assistance isnt free and makes old media ever more dependent on Silicon Valley for its future. Hardly a secure prospect for a beleaguered industry.

What is it? The estimated combined revenue of a proposed merger of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular.Why is it important? The all-share merger will create Indias largest telecom company, larger than the Rs-50,008-crore-earning Bharti Airtel. Debt on both the companies books and likely losses incurred from the tariff-reduction race started by Reliance Jio are being seen as triggers for the move. It looks like a much needed consolidation boost in the 22-circle Indian telecom market, as seen from the stock gains of Indian telecom operators yesterday ranging 8-10% with Idea gaining a record 26%.Tell me more: The merged entry would still have to address, in many markets, the telecom regulators anti-monopoly restrictions of owning no more than 50% of spectrum in a band and 25% of available spectrum in a circle (or geographic market). 1 dayWhat is it? Number of days to go before the RBI-mandated daily ATM withdrawal limit of Rs 10,000 is removed, from February 1.Why is it important? The first sign of reverting to pre-demonetisation days of cash management was made with RBIs circular removing the ATM limit. Two weeks ago, RBI signalled its ease in handling cash by expanding the limit to Rs 10,000 from Rs 4,500. The Rs 24,000-weekly limit on savings-bank withdrawal, however, stays put, but restrictions on current account, cash credit and overdraft accounts will be removed. Tell me more: RBI mentions the savings-bank limit is under consideration for withdrawal in the near future. Banks can use their discretion to set their own operating limits at ATMs as was the practice before old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were withdrawn.42What is it? The number of cases the Income Tax (IT) department registered nationwide under the recently-enforced Benami Transactions Act.Why is it important? Warnings in public advertisements by the IT department against depositing unaccounted old currency in someone elses bank account anonymously are materialising now. The Benami Acts section 24 has been invoked for 87 notices, for attaching bank accounts with crores of rupees of such dubious deposits and an immovable property.Tell me more: These cases, if proven true, would attract a heavy penalty and a rigorous jail-term of a maximum of seven years. 4What is it? The number of new administrators appointed by the Supreme Court to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).Why is it important? The neutral committee headed by former Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), and the current Chairman of Banks Board Bureau, Vinod Rai, will pave the path to reform the embattled BCCI, richest sporting body in India and the most profitable cricket board in the world. The team, with a mix of financial acumen, social perspective and cricketing enthusiasm, is tasked with bringing in accounting rigour and good governance to a body mired in controversies, the latest being its earlier president and secretary sacked on January 3. It would also finalise the Indian Premier Leagues 10th edition besides reporting on the Lodha panel recommendations to the court.Tell me more: The other members are Vikram Limaye, managing director and CEO of IDBI Bank; former Indian womens cricket captain Diana Edulji; and historian and writer Ramchandra Guha.

A third entity, Paytm, has also been given a payments bank licence by RBI, and is expected to launch soon.Can only love for our postman ensure success for India Post Payments Bank?Payments banks might pose a challenge to traditional banks for small amount deposits due to lower overhead cost, finance minister Arun Jaitley said at the IPPB launch. More than 155,000 post offices of India Post will now start operating as payment banks and prove to be game changer for financial inclusion in the country. As mandated by RBI, these new banks will focus on providing basic financial services, including payments of all sorts, including social security and utility bill payments, remittance services, current and saving accounts with a balance of up to Rs1 lakh; distribution of insurance, mutual funds and pension products, and acting as business correspondent to other banks for credit products, especially in rural areas and among the underserved segments of the population.India Post plans to open 650 new branches in its first phase by September. Currently, the department of post has an existing network of around 155,000 post offices.

P. Singh, interim managing director and chief executive officer of IPPB.Apart from the vision and structure, the success of the payments bank will depend on Gramin Dak Sevaks, postmen and the unsung postal assistants who will take banking to doorsteps, he added.IPPB will offer three distinct accounts to its customers: Safal, the regular account; Sugam, a basic savings bank deposit account (BSBDA); and Saral, BSBDA-Small.While the Safal account is packed with features, Saral is aimed at people with limited banking experience. All three bank account options will request its customers to make a Rs100 initial minimum deposit, with no minimum balance requirements. Both Safal and Sugam need KYC (know your customer) details for verification and minimum age of 10 years, but Saral can be opened by anyone above the age of 10 years without KYC.Interest rates have been fixed as 4.5% if the quarterly average balance is up to Rs25,000, 5% if it is between Rs25,000 and Rs50,000, and 5.5% if above Rs50,000.There are no charges on cash withdrawals, unlike Airtel Payments Bank.Airtel Payments Bank launched, with vow to shake up old banking systemEarlier this month, Airtel Payments Bank launched nationwide operations, offering 7.25% interest on savings, which is more than the maximum of 7% paid by State Bank of India, the countrys largest bank, on fixed deposits.

0.6,"Davos: Indias biggest lender by assets, State Bank of India (SBI), could tap capital markets next fiscal year to raise up to $1.5 billion, its chief said on Friday, though it first needs to complete a planned merger with its subsidiary banks.
				   
				In an interview with Reuters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Arundhati Bhattacharya also said the lender would look to raise funds from stake sales in its life insurance unit that could list in a year to 18 months, and by paring its holding in UTI Asset Management Co., which is also looking to go public.We do plan to raise some capital. However, this is also dependent on the fact that there is a merger that we are planning to do, said Bhattacharya, 60, who has been at the helm of SBI as its chairman since late 2013. SBI, which is merging its five subsidiary banks with itself and also taking over a small state-run lender for women, previously expected the merger to be completed by March. The deals could now get delayed by a quarter, Bhattacharya said, as banks are still busy replacing withdrawn banknotes after Indias sudden move in November to cancel 86% of its currency. Indias fiscal year starts in April.ALSO READ: Indian banks said to seek reprieve for $13 billion loan revampAs long as the merger is not over and done with, it could be difficult to approach the capital markets, Bhattacharya said, adding the lender could look to raise between $1 billion and $1.5 billion from the markets.SBI last sold shares in January 2014 to raise $1.2 billion.  Bhattacharya said activities were slowly getting back to normal as effects of the banknote ban subside, although it would still take until the end of February to fully gauge the impact.Bhattacharya hoped recent lending rate cuts by banks including SBI, after they were flush with billions of dollars of deposits following the banknote ban, would help kickstart credit growth, which is hovering near two-decade lows.We feel that credit growth will pick up ... definitely by the second half of next (fiscal) year we should see substantial pick up, she said. Ratings agency Fitch estimates Indias banks will need about $90 billion to meet global Basel III rules which are due to be fully implemented by March 2019.Indian banks face a March deadline from the countrys central bank to identify and make provisions for the troubled assets.

				Containers, which account for about half of Indias exim trade volumes, grew by a decent 5.2% in August. So far this fiscal year, they are up 4.3%, better than the 2.4% rise in the year-ago period, shows data compiled by ICICI Securities Ltd. According to Maersk Line, improving trade with mature marketsEurope and Americascan help container volumes maintain the positive growth momentum in the rest of the calendar year also. While the full-year growth may still be in single digits, anaemic global trade means Indias exim numbers are seen as a bright spot, especially by trade liners and logistics solutions providers. We can expect Indian trade to clock 8-9% growth for the full year 2016, which will be four times the growth of global trade, Maersk Line said in a statement.Non-ferrous metal prices may flatten out in second halfThe near-term outlook for non-ferrous metal prices indicates a flat trend in the second half of fiscal year 2017, after an uptrend in the first half, according to ratings agency Icra Ltd. Since global capacity utilization is 80%, if rising prices prompt higher output, prices could get affected. In the domestic market, apparent consumption in the first quarter was healthy, with a 25% increase in aluminium consumption over a year ago, 10% in copper and 13% in zinc, due to higher demand from power transmission and distribution, and the automobile sectors. Icra cautions high consumption levels may not continue, especially in aluminium, as they may be partly due to an inventory build-up. Its longer-term outlook for base metals remains positive.Petcoke prices continue their upward trendDomestic refiners have increased petroleum coke (petcoke) prices again this month, according to analysts.Prices are now 9.5% higher compared to the September quarter, according to HDFC Securities Ltd.

-0.6,"At 62, Max Group founder Analjit Singh is trim and fit and says he is at peace with himselfa state of mind achieved because he doesnt feel the need for habra any more. Translated from Punjabi, that means he is no longer in a tearing hurry, as he was 30 years ago.
				   
				In January, Analjit Singh stepped down as chairman of the group he founded in 1982 and built into a Rs15,000 crore empire, with interests in life insurance; health and allied businesses; and speciality packaging films. In August, the board of Max Life Insurance Co. Ltd signed off on a merger with HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd that will create Indias largest private-sector insurer, with Rs1.1 trillion in assets.The promoters of Max Financialessentially Analjit Singh, his family and related family firmswill hold a 6.5% stake in the merged company and also get a non-compete fee of Rs850 crore. Analjit Singh, who within Max Group is called BAS (short for Bhai Analjit Singh, bhai being an honorific meaning brother), doesnt like being called a promoter, preferring the term sponsor, and seems to have achieved what most business family owners can only think of wistfullya degree of detachment from the business that allows him to take decisions without any emotional baggage.Analjit Singh stands out among the top echelons of business leadership in India for his ability to spot an opportunity like he did with telecom (Singh made Rs561 crore in 1998 by selling his 41% stake in a joint venture with Hutchison Whampoa Ltd)  and insurance and healthcare early on, and  more than that to quit when on top. He ascribes that to foresight and luck; but in reality, it is the mark of a businessman who can read the tea leaves.Analjit Singh, with the reputation of a serial entrepreneur, is also exploring new businesses, including information technology, real estate and education, under Max Ventures and Industries Ltd (MVIL). In an interview at his elegant home on New Delhis tony Abul Kalam Azad Road, Analjit Singh patiently explained his philosophy of life, his current state of mind and how the two relate to his business. Edited excerpts:As a strategic businessman, what are the things you are looking at now? When you look at these opportunities, what excites you the most?
I am not so sure that people in my situation look at entrepreneurial opportunities from purely a new-world perspective, as you pointed out. I think they look at entrepreneurial and future opportunities in rather a traditional way but think of these developments as enablers.What is the traditional way?
It is perspective of the market, key differentiators, compatibility of extensive weaknesses of the individual and the firm to be able to do something like this. So, therefore, in the traditional criteria of finding these opportunities what I meant was market, differentiator, opportunities, regulation...new factor, completely new factor in the decision-making set. The market is over-crowded. Everybody is in the business of over-promising and under-delivering. Capital is no longer a constraint like it was before. To some extent, even technology is no longer a constraint to those people who have some experience and network, you can find the technology. Anything is possible. If you run a world-class airline, technology is available. So, execution is the key. Team is a big factor. Team was never a question in our mind in the past 10-15 years. Today, if I were looking to be in a big business, probably the first question that I will ask apart from market and differentiator is people and team; and then you look at these new-world solutions that you are talking about as how they can become enablers to what they can do.Besides that, this question is not so pertinent to me. I am not super-engaged to be so rattled about what am I going to do and what will be my next big play. It is not top-most of my mind.But you will do new things, right?
I will do new things, but I will say I am not besotted with it anymore. My interest is more to tame myself and tame my mind and tame my life. Do you know this word habra? I have no habra.Were you like that when you did the diversification?
Of course not! Thirty years ago, I was always in a rush.If you forget about the future for now and look at the past 16 years, what are the things that you have picked up?
I dont call myself a promoter. I prefer the word sponsor. I think if a sponsor does not have an affinity with the business, that business unless by luck things take-off, I think that business drags. The affinity of a sponsor to a particular business segment is very important. If (Bharti Airtel Ltd founder) Sunil Mittal did not have an affinity for telecom or for technology, Airtel would not have been what it is today (Indias biggest phone services provider). If I did not have an affinity for being in the businesses of life and, therefore, focus on healthcare and insurance for 15-16 years, it wouldnt have worked.Affinity and focus leads to execution, passion capital, heavy-lifting, good team equals to success. Therefore, you can apply that mantra to anythingold world or new world. What would you call an old-world business? Pick anything. If I say to myself that I am going to leave everything in my life and get into steel and cement, I will find a new way of doing it and I will be successful in 5-7 years. I will find a way because the need for steel and cement is not gone. If you do it as another unit with the traditional way and traditional people, it is a recipe for disaster. So, we have to find an IndiGo (Indias biggest airline) way of getting in steel or cement. IndiGo is a very good example of what I am saying. What is the revolution and reinvention of being in the airline business? People have been in the airline business. They are in the airline business. They will be in the airline business, but most companies fail. So, why is IndiGo successful? Do you think (IndiGo co-founder) Rahul Bhatia goes and fixes the tyres of the plane every day? No. But somewhere between Aditya (Ghosh, IndiGo president) and him, the way they work is set. So, the way we work in insurance and healthcare is set, and everybody then would perform to that tune. Thats because you have affinity. Thats a clear lesson and experience that I can share.Somebody asked me the other day that you are not even now non-executive chairman of your companies. I am of the MVIL (Max Ventures India Ltd) because I am having fun again after 30 years to nurture a new company. Of those, you are of Vodafone.My point there was: to be a non-executive chairman of a company where you are a sponsor is very different from a non-executive chairman of a company where you are not a sponsor. My remake, role, life, expectations, contact, engagement, communication has to be very different if I am a non-executive chairman of a Max company. The deliverables and expectations are different when it comes to  being non-executive chairman of Vodafone. I am not a sponsor. They dont have the same expectation.When do you as a promoter decide that it is time that you should become a sponsor? Let us assume that this second wave of successful diversification that you did were not successful, would you still be saying all this?
So, in a way, it also gets linked to your expectations from future and living with disappointments from your past. Thats in a way what you are saying. I think the honest answer has to be that if the outcomes were not as exciting as they have been, I think, I would have not been as restful in my mind about it as I am appearing right now. I think thats possibly the case, but it also means in my current way of thinking that I would have to work harder at myself to become restful about the disappointments of the past.So, luckily for meand luck is a factor or the blessing that I havethe way I see it from nature and everything else is that these have moved reasonably in tandem. If they had not, the stretch would have been more and one would have to work harder to overcome those disappointments.Is there someone else in your fraternity who has done this really well? Is there a role model?
I wont go to the extent of saying whether I have a role model. I wont say that I am looking at somebody and say look how he did it. But I can tell you who has done it and done it very successfully. He is Vikram Lal (promoter of Eicher Motors Ltd). He is very restful and peaceful as a person. Look what has happened to Eicher. He wanted a particular life for some reason and he went after it and he has got it.I so solidly believe in impermanence that for me to be attached to a business, in this case, life insurance, it is stupid to be attached to it. When life is impermanent then what is this stigma about a business being permanent. Today, when you look at it, the power of this sector in this business is moving to banks. Whether these (insurance) companies are going to be profitable or not will not be because our premiums will get higher. We have the highest persistency (a measure of policy renewals) in the country84%. It is unheard of. The No. 2 company is 63%. So, I cant have more persistency in this business. The banks are now controlling distribution virtually. So, the only way to improve profitability is expense management. So, power shifting from agency to bankers, premiums not going up, expense management, regulators everywhere in this world are tightening the screws on the companies. Solvency margin, shareholder profits, expense allowance and disallowance, participating account versus shareholder account. No. 3 some sort of going back to expense management and market share, some sort of geographies have emerged for different companies. We are very strong in Gujarat; Gujarat is our second or third largest territory. But, more or less, we are more strong in the north and the south than we are in the west or east. HDFC (Life) is more strong in the west and the south than they are in the north. So, if you take the bank they are, you take the opportunity to consolidate and, therefore, cut some unessential costs and you take the link and fourth, product. In our time, we were heavily into protection and savings products. Even today, 80% of our business comes from protection and savings products, not from ULIPs (unit-linked insurance plans) and the like. HDFC is other way around, may be two-third or one-third.These are the four things that I saw writing on the wall about. And I have to tell you that when as a sponsor, among the 23 or 24 companies that are in life (insurance), if you take the balance sheet of the sponsor, we must be one of the smallest, I think. So from being in that position to sitting at No.3 of 23-24 with all the names you know sitting below us, you can get spoilt; and then, one fine day, because of these four factors, nobody gives you notice of failure in life like you never get notice of death.The same is in this business, some things just happen, and they change and then all of a sudden you say, oh shit what has happened?Six months ago, we were like this. And you come from 3 to 6 to 8 to 9. I dont want to take that chance; but then, it will go back to the question you asked me that if at the end of all this it was not good, would you have felt the same thing and I would have said no and I would have to start again, building again. I can see it happening, but my responsibility is I must not let it happen. Here is my opportunity that God has sent to me, I must take it.But you do take impulsive decisions? You do take decisions on the basis of your instinct?
Of course, you do.In South Africa, for instance.
Of course, I did. But hang on, yes and no. The impulsive decision that was taken about South Africa was not for business. The impulsive decision was to want to be there and enjoy the location. Like I may have a home. So, that was the impulsive decision. When it started to go away from becoming a holiday home or retreat to business, then I am very conscious, not impulsive. So, today that operation is being run exactly like any company of the Max group, with a board, people, CEOs, accountability, targets, budgets, matrix and data.Is it a part of the Max group?
No, no, private. Max has nothing to do with it.Could you elaborate a little bit, what is it about?
It is about hospitality, lifestyle, hotels, rooms, agriculture, plums, wines, almonds, wine-making, selling wines, three hotels, beer. We have a similar property in the UK. The first property is Linthwaite (Lake District Hotel, Linthwaite House), which is in the UK. So, we will grow in the UK. We have just acquired it in April. On 25 April, we took over.Whats the vision for it?
I have always wanted to be in the hospitality business. When I started vision 2000 of Max, I picked four areas: it was insurance, healthcare, education and hospitality. When we got cracking on insurance and healthcare, we did not have five rupees, or five minutes or five calories of energy to invest in anything other than insurance and healthcare; so we left it at that. In a way, Antara (homes for senior citizens) and remotely Vana (wellness resort) were born out of this idea of hospitality. And now, I am starting my life in education. Education is one of them, but it is a little too premature to talk about. In education, we have started some work. Are we engaged in it? Yes, but what are we going do, I dont know. But we have decided to be in that sector, so I dont know whether its 0 to 11 or KG to 16.Is someone thinking about this?
Yes. Very much. But just now, in August, its too soon for me to say whether its going to be Boeing or Airbus or north only or all India or only abroad... But it will be top three. I just like that expression of top three. And it should be, otherwise whats the point?Why are you interested in the real estate business?
I have a bit of khurak (itch) here. Actually, my grandfather was in the contracting business. That was my great grandfathers business in Pakistan. The bhai family were contractors. They built the road from India to Burma as a case in point. So, even now, you go to Lahore and all, and you will see a lot of buildings built by them. People in the street remember them as a family. So, I have a khurak for civil, real estate and stuff. I like land. I like construction, I like design. I like building. Every time the economy is on the cusp, and every time we talk about India being the next big thing... there are sections which are being talked about such as manufacturing, real estate, education... Do you see the economy like that?
I do and on the manufacturing side, I cant tell you anything today. I hope I can tell you in 60 days. We will, if all goes well, we will be in that space, in the prime ministers central part of his vision... Make in India.

-0.17,"Steel Authority of India Ltds (Sail) physical steel sales rose by only 3.7% from a year ago in the June quarter, and even an increase in steel prices doesnt appear to have benefited it much.
				   
				The companys per-tonne steel realization shows an increase of just 0.5% over a year ago. What saved the quarter for Sail was a decline in its raw material costs.Sails revenue declined by 2.7% from a year ago to Rs.9,238 crore, while its operating profit improved to Rs234 crore compared with Rs89 crore. A sequential comparison is not possible due to the shift to Ind-AS accounting standards from the current quarter.Although its operating profit has improved, an increase in depreciation and finance costs, and a decline in other income has contributed to a loss of Rs535 crore versus a loss of Rs248 crore in the year-ago period.The substantial widening of its loss is what may have caused the 5.68% decline in its share on Friday.Sails share has been gaining ground in the past three months to 9 September,  and is up by 12.9% compared with a 21.4% increase in the BSE Metal Index. Although its operating margin has improved, it is not enough to cover the increase seen in depreciation and interest costs.The scenario for steel companies had improved with the imposition of anti-dumping duty and minimum import price on steel imports. The months of July and August have seen some improvement in Sails output, on a sequential basis. A gradual pick-up in sales will give investors confidence that its output can reach higher levels, justifying the investments it is making in adding to steel capacity.The outlook for domestic steel prices has improved with the government lending support and global prices rising. Domestic demand remains a worry though. In April-August, steel consumption rose by only 1.3% over a year ago, according to data from the Joint Plant Committee. However, an increase in exports and a decline in imports is supporting an increase in domestic production.Investors will be happy even if Sails output does not increase by much but is able to report a much higher jump in profits.

-0.31,"To look into the future 10 years from now, take a step back and see where India or, for that matter, the world was 10 years ago. There were no smartphones, no taxi apps and no mobile wallets. Now, almost every part of our lives is touched by smartphone technology. If you ask me what the next big wave in technology that will change our lives 10 years from now will be, its going to be robots: They are going to do everything from fighting wars on borders to providing companionship. They are going to be ubiquitous, or, as I have named my company, they are going to be omnipresent. Furthermore, their impact on our lives will be unlike that of any other technology so far, because they will interact with us in a manner similar to the way we interact with other humans, holding conversations, working together, playing together and learning from one another. They are going to solve some of the biggest problems humanity is facing, including pollution control, food and energy production, tackling incurable diseases, and strengthening defence.
				   
				Talking about defence, the Indian Army has announced that it wants to run a third of its operations through robots in the next 10 years. This may be an aggressive goal, but even if 10% of the operations are run by robots, this would translate to 100,000 robots. This is quite achievable, considering that the US army is already using over 20,000 robots and similar numbers are being used by the Chinese. Omnipresent Tech recently flew drones (basically flying robots) as part of Border Security Force (BSF) and army trials and we learnt that the defence and security sector is expected to use over 100,000 drones in the coming decade. In addition, robotic boats and submarines will be used by the navy. The robotics market for defence in India is expected to touch over $10 billion (around Rs68,000 crore) annually in the next decade.Another growth sector is factory and warehouse robots. We have already seen one success story in India in this sector: Grey Orange Robotics makes warehouse robots for Flipkart and several other e-commerce companies. A few years ago, Amazon had bought Kiva Systems (now Amazon Robotics), which provides factory robots to Amazon globally, for $775 million. We are also going to see revolutionary changes in factory automationsome of the assembly and repair works that earlier required humans will be done entirely by robots. This sector itself could create a $5 billion annual market in India.Recently, multiple annual contracts were signed by Omnipresent with Indias largest oil sector company, which processes over 100 million barrels of crude every day. By periodically surveying their civil installations with our drones and automatically generating intelligent reports, we were able to save the company several days of shutdown time and loss of productivity. This model is applicable not only to oil companies but to all companies which run a factory 24x7 and cannot afford shutdown time. These include cement, fertilizer, paper, chemicals, sugar and textile factories. This sector is poised to be a market worth over $10 billion annually in India for robotics products and services.Another major change will be that robots will enter our homes and do most of the household chores, including cleaning and folding clothes, washing dishes and driving cars. They will also clean our polluted land, air and water, a big problem in India. Recently, we built a river-cleaning Ro-boat for this purpose and deployed it in the Yamuna river. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, US, has recognized Ro-boat as one of the top 20 innovations in India.The big change will be in the agriculture sector, where drones and robots will boost yield and save damage by as much as 40%; this would have a great impact on the countrys gross domestic product (GDP). Lastly, nanorobots are going to bring about a revolution in medical treatmentthink of them as tiny artificial cells, they will run in our blood and attack pathogens, tumours and blockages, effectively boosting life expectancy by 30-40%. So how has all this suddenly become possible? The answer lies in the revolution that has taken place in machine learningthe machines are now able to learn like humans if you give them enough data to train on. Recently, Google showed that its machine-learning algorithms can write poetry, create paintings, identify any bird or animal, even dream. We effectively used this technique to automatically identify vehicles and chase them via drones.Are machines going to take over our jobs? Similar questions have been asked time and again from the time the first printing press came, to the time the first computers arrived. I dont think jobs are going to vanish but the quality of jobs is going to improve, from repetitive work to more creative activity. Robots will do all the dull, dirty and dangerous tasks and create a new wave in the economy with a million new things that were not possible earlier. If you are planning to start a company in robotics or invest in this sector or take it up as a career, now is perhaps the golden time!Aakash Sinha is founder and CEO of Omnipresent Robot Tech.This is part of a series of articles in Mints 10th anniversary special issue that look at India 10 years from now.

0.05,"The first quarter of 2016 has been tough but not all grim for Indias start-up market. Start-ups across sectors continued to attract early and growth capital, even staging a small recovery from the slump reported in the previous quarter in terms of overall capital raised. Data compiled by London-based Preqin puts the total value of venture capital deals concluded during the January-March quarter at $1.6 billion, up 47% from the fourth quarter of 2015.
				   
				The surge comes largely on the back of a handful of big-ticket deals that closed despite the withdrawal of a host of later-stage investors, such as hedge funds, from the market. In January, online travel company MakeMyTrip raised a $180 million round from Shanghai-based travel services company Ctrip. The same month, private equity investors Temasek Holdings and Warburg Pincus participated in a $145 million round in auto classifieds platform CarTrade. February saw e-commerce marketplace Snapdeal announce a $200 million investment led by Canadian pension fund Ontario Teachers Pension Plan (though a sizeable portion was paid out to venture capital firms Saama Capital and Sequoia Capital, who sold stakes in the company). And in March, grocery e-tailer BigBasket raised $150 million from an investor consortium that included The Abraaj Group and Sands Capital Management.However, these deals dont necessarily indicate that the funding slowdown that became official in the last quarter of 2015 is now a thing of the past.Since were specifically concerned with how early-stage investors behaved during the quarter, we will take into account deals that were concluded at the angel and seed stages and, separately, at the Series A through C stages. At the angel and seed stages, investors closed 146 deals worth $35 million. That represents a 46% drop in value terms when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, even though the volume of deals grew 5%. This may have happened because of two factors. One, venture capital firms have cut back on the big seed-investment programmes that were all the rage till late last year. Now that entry valuations at later-stage start-ups, particularly at the Series B and C stages, are becoming less expensive, theyd much rather divert more capital that way. Two, the ticket sizes of deals at the seed stage may have started coming back to normal. Remember, not too many quarters ago, it wasnt unusual to hear of seed rounds closing at $2 million.Now lets look at the Series A through C stages, venture capitals traditional playground. Venture capitalists closed 33 early deals worth $172 million at the Series A through C stages. Thats a 19.5% decline in terms of volume and a bruising 57.5% decline in value terms compared to the October-December 2015 quarter. The big casualties are the Series B and C stages. This is where start-ups, fed on a staple of generous deal ticket sizes and even more generous valuations for most of last year, are hurting the most.Investors deployed just $34 million across eight Series B deals, against $130 million across 10 deals in the October-December quarter. The Series C stage reported $53 million deployed across four deals, compared to $179 million and three deals in the last quarter.The slower pace of investments at the Series B and C stages means that venture capitalists are still not comfortable with the valuations that are being sought by companies at those stages. By Preqins estimates, India-focused venture capital funds are sitting on dry powder or uninvested capital worth $3.4 billion. That capital, going by how investors have behaved in the first quarter, is not going anywhere in a hurry.Snigdha Sengupta is a freelance journalist based in Mumbai and founder of StartupCentral.

				Revenue and volume are up 18% from a year ago. As has been the case in recent quarters, Latin America led the growth with a 37% rise in revenue. What came as a surprise though is a strong 20% growth in the India business.A combination of dry spells, delayed crop seasons and demonetization-induced disruption to business has reduced growth expectations of  agrochemical companies. Validating that view, Rallis India Ltd recently reported a subdued 8% growth for the December quarter despite a favourable base.UPLs India business also has the benefit of a favourable baserevenue in Q3 last fiscal was down 17%. Even then, as one analyst with a domestic broking firm points out, the growth is stronger than expectations. A crop shift in favour of pulses, soyabean, oilseeds and corn resulted in improved demand for herbicides, which helped drive the top line, Sharekhan said in a note.In Latin America, the company benefited from better crop area and yield improvements in Brazil, a large market for UPL in terms of revenue. Its insecticide brands did well due to the high infestation of sucking insect in soybean. In North America, the business was flat as low incomes made farmers wary of investing in agriculture inputs. Business in Europe grew 8%. Its herbicides products did well, the company said in its results presentation.While revenue in the rest of the countries grew 2%, Latin America and India stood as major growth drivers for UPL. In a conference call with analysts, the management maintained a 12-15% revenue growth forecast and 60-100 basis points expansion in operating margin.Achieving the growth guidance may not look challenging, especially with revenue already rising 14% so far this fiscal.But the growth outlook in the current quarter is less sanguine. The major consumption phase is over in three key geographies-the US, Europe and India. Management has also cautioned for a tougher operating environment during Q4 FY17 in North America, Europe and India, Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd adds.This puts the growth burden on Latin America. Thankfully, the prospects in the region, especially Brazil, remain encouraging.Though the valuation at 16 times one-year-forward earnings estimates does not look expensive yet, two factors will play a crucial role in the continuing outperformance of the UPL stock.One is the maintenance of revenue growth momentum.

-0.64,"New Delhi:  Falling coal stockpiles at Indian power plants could stoke demand for the fuel supplied by Coal India Ltd., helping spur output that has slipped year-on-year for the past three months.
				   
				Production by the worlds biggest miner in October fell 2% from the same month last year, while shipments dropped 3%, the company said on Tuesday. Both missed targets. Meanwhile, national inventories at power plants have fallen by almost half since hitting a record in April. Stockpiles were enough for 14 days of demand on average, though several plants were running with less than a weeks stockpiles, a level considered critical by Indian regulators, according to data from the Central Electricity Authority.The demand from the power sector continues to remain subdued, but it should start looking up now, said Abhisar Jain, an analyst at Mumbai-based Centrum Broking Ltd. Power plant coal stocks have been falling and good monsoons this season should boost industrial activity. We expect these to have a positive impact on coal demand in the coming months.The surge in international coal prices will also support Coal Indias efforts to displace imports of the fuel with domestic supplies, Jain said. Coal India reduced prices of higher grades of coal in May to compete with imports. Australias Newcastle coal, a seaborne benchmark in Asia, has more than doubled this year, ending last week at near $106 a metric ton, according to data from Globalcoal.Indias power generators had stocks for 18 days of demand on average a year ago, and 26 days as of 4 April, when inventories peaked, according to CEA data that tracks 102 facilities.

0.55,"Bengaluru: Reliance AIF Asset Management Co. Ltd is raising a Rs1,000 crore rental yield fund, its first initiative to buy and own office projects. Besides Reliance AIFs fund, two more such office investment funds are expected to launched this year.
				   
				Reliance AIF, a unit of Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd, launched the fund in January and is looking at investing in high-quality assets in key cities that will generate regular rental income and capital appreciation on exiting the property. The fund that will raise capital from domestic and offshore investors comes amid a prolonged slowdown Indias real estate sector, with weak residential sales and uncertainty over recovery. However, steady lease rentals, good absorption levels, inadequate supply and global investor interest have breathed life into the commercial office sector.There are no development risks attached to owning and leasing out Grade A commercial office assets. This is a large and growing asset class and there are enough opportunities. The attractiveness is that this asset class offers periodic rental income typically higher than that generated on bonds, along with significant potential for capital appreciation on exits. This is an opportune time for capturing potential upside on office assets, said Shahzad Madon, head of portfolio management services and alternative assets at Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management.The Reliance Rental Yield Fund is a 4-6 year fund that will buy or fund pre-leased, rent generating properties. It targets a rental yield of 7.5-8.25% per annum and a gross internal rate of return (IRR) of 12-16% at a fund level, including capital appreciation on exit.Reliance already has a strong pipeline of transactions and is expecting to do the first closing shortly, around the time it will also start deploying the capital, Madon said. The new fund will have the first-mover advantage, even though there is a pipeline of more office funds coming up later this year, analysts said.After the economic slowdown in 2008, developers gave up capital-intensive office projects and shifted focus to the residential market, which seemed a safe bet at the time. A number of large apartment projects came up in the next few years, resulting in a glut in the market and another slowdown in 2012-13.Madon said its a good time to invest in office properties, with valuations being reasonable and prices not having gone up.The commercial office sector is in the cusp of a recovery, he said.Though demand is in excess of supply of office space today, there is a good pipeline of projects with developers looking to build new office projects again. Not just the top few cities, but Hyderabad is back on the radar and even a market like Navi Mumbai attracts good demand for new office space, said Shashank Jain, partner, transaction services at PricewaterhouseCoopers India.If all goes well, 2017 will also mark two significant events in commercial real estate. DLF Ltds stake sale in its commercial property arm, DLF CyberCity Developers Ltd, to institutional investors, is expected to be concluded and Embassy Group and Blackstone Group Lp may go for a real estate investment trust (REIT) listing.Reliance AIF is currently also raising a Rs1,000-crore residential fund from Indian and overseas investors.

-0.62,"Shares of Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) have performed well in recent months. One reason for the optimism is increasing crude oil prices. Brent crude prices have averaged higher so far for the current quarter compared to the September quarter. 
				   
				The state-run upstream oil company has announced a decent set of numbers for the quarter ended 30 September. Its operating profit or Ebitda came in at Rs9,539 crore. Analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd and Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd were expecting the measure at about Rs8,930 crore. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. One reason that helped ONGC beat estimates is a decline in operating costs. Statutory levies and other expenses declined 13% and 8%, respectively, on a year-on-year basis. Not only that, exploration costs written off fell sharply as well. Finance costs dropped 7.5%. The upshot: ONGCs pre-tax earnings increased 4% at a time when revenue declined 10% and other income was a bit lower.While the companys September quarter crude oil production is lower compared to last years quarter, crude oil and gas production both have improved compared to the June quarter. Net realization for the September quarter stood at $47.92 per barrel, an improvement on a sequential basis, which was pretty much expected. If the recent strength in oil prices were to persist, then upstream oil companies including ONGC will benefit this quarter. However, at the same time, some of the gains from higher oil prices are likely to be set off by the 18% lower domestic gas price effective 1 October.But investors have no reason to complain.

In his free time at IIT, he would study programming languages such as Fortran.On Indias centrality to Googles plans, Pichai said the technology giant was training some two million people to develop mobile applications.India has the potential to emerge as a powerhouse in software development, but it will take a few more years to realise that potential, he said.What India needs to become a global player in digital economy, competitive with any country in the world is cheap devicesa $30 smart phone, according to Pichai.In India, Google is working on launching its services in as many languages as possible, he said. Further, it is working with the government and state-owned enterprises such as RailTel Corp. to expand access to the Internet.It is estimated that by 2020, India will have 500 million smartphone users.ALSO READ: H-1B visa: Indian IT companies seem like latest Donald Trump casualtyIt is a great opportunity that in India, enterprises such as Google can work in collaboration with the government, Pichai said.Globally, Google will continue to focus on building capacity in machine learning and artificial intelligence, leveraging the dramatic improvement in computing speed in recent times, he said.Machine learning can make a big difference in many fields, he said, citing the example of diabetic retinopathya condition that can lead to loss of vision. Machine learning can help with early detection of diabetic retinopathy, which is key to dealing with it, he said.Asked by a student where he saw himself in 10 years, Pichai said he wasnt sure.

1.0,"For years, private investors have lived with a rigid model concession agreement (MCA) that outlines the terms and conditions of a cargo contract at ports owned by the Indian government.
				   
				This may be about to change as India embarks on an ambitious programme for port-led development that entails the setting up of 400 projects requiring an investment of some Rs.4.5 trillion.The new MCA written by the shipping ministry seeks to replace the rigidity associated with the present one to deal with market dynamics over a contract period that typically lasts 30 years. In its place, the new MCA will give more flexibility to investors. Mechanisms are being introduced to better balance risks between stakeholders rather than subject the private developer to more risks than the port authority, as is currently the case. For instance, the new MCA will facilitate the extension or reduction of the contract tenure to deal with cargo volatilities. It will allow private developers to extend the concession period if the traffic demand is lower than forecast due to regulatory changes. Accordingly, if the actual average traffic for 15 years from the start of commercial operations falls short of the target traffic by more than 20%, then for every slab of 2% shortfall above the threshold of 20%, the concession period shall be increased by one year. Such increases, though, will be restricted to 10 years overall. The target traffic will be equivalent to 70% of the capacity of the project. For instance, in the event of a shortfall of 25% in target traffic, the concession period will be increased by two years. On the other hand, if the actual average traffic for 15 years exceeds the target traffic, then for every slab of 2% excess above the threshold of 20%, the concession period shall be reduced by one year and such reductions will be capped at three years overall. However, the private developer can avoid the reduction in the concession period by opting to pay a further premium equal to 10% of the gross revenue in the respective years. Port contracts are decided on the basis of revenue sharethe entity willing to share the most from its annual revenue will get the deal.The new MCA seeks to introduce the minimum guaranteed revenue (MGR) concept in place of the existing minimum guaranteed cargo (MGC) norms.A private developer is currently bound by the MGC prescribed by the MCA. Failure to achieve the prescribed MGC for three consecutive years can lead to termination of the contract.However, the minimum cargo levels may not be achieved due to a variety of reasons, including those beyond the control of the private developer.For a multi-cargo terminal, the MGR gives more flexibility. Because, even if the facility is not doing well in one particular cargo, it would be able to perform better in some other cargo which has a higher tariff. Whereas, in the case of MGC, the developer will only target a particular cargo of a certain capacity. This makes the contract more stringent. The MGR gives more flexibility because in case the tariff goes up or revenue rises, even with lesser cargo, the developer will be able to meet the MGR. In a way, the MGR concept takes the cargo pressure out of a developers mind. This could bring in revenue pressures. MGR, still, is the right approach because it makes more logical sense. The revenue share payable by the private developer to the port authority will be computed on the maximum/ceiling rate allowed to be levied on users. The discounts given to users are excluded from the calculation of gross revenue.However, if the discount offered to users is more than 10% of the ceiling rate, the private developer will be allowed to pay revenue share on the discounted tariff, with the approval of the port authority, according to the new plan.Storage charges will also now be excluded from the computation of gross revenue in a departure from the current practice.The original promoters of the project should hold 51% of the equity for three years after the start of commercial operations, 26% equity for another three years and thereafter exit the project completely. The promoters, however, can exit the project earlier by seeking a waiver of the 26% equity holding requirement from the port authority subject to achievement of performance parameters during the three years after commercial operations. In the existing MCA, the promoters have to hold 51% equity for three years after commercial operations and a 26% stake during the balance period of concession.Cargo-handling contracts to be auctioned by the Indian government-owned ports will allow flexibility to its operators to move to new tariff regimes than the one prescribed at the time of signing the deal.Currently, private developers are bound by the tariff guidelines applicable on the date of signing the concession agreement for setting the rates to be collected from users of the facilities, according to the current MCA.However, in the event the said tariff guidelines are either amended, revised or replaced by a fresh set of tariff guidelines at any time during the concession period, such amended, revised or fresh set of tariff guidelines, as the case may be, shall be the applicable tariff guidelines, provided the concessionaire (the private developer) exercises an option to recover tariff under such amended, revised or fresh set of tariff guidelines within a period of 30 days from the date of its publication in the official gazette, the shipping ministry wrote in the draft of the revised MCA.So far, in case the existing tariff guidelines are later amended, revised or replaced by a fresh set tariff of guidelines, it has not been made applicable to an existing private developer.  The large-scale overhaul of the contract terms is a big positive for port investors.P.

				That will change next year, when Apple Inc. plans to adopt the technology for the next major upgrade to its flagship product. To do so, the Cupertino, California-based company will have to get its hands on millions of OLED screens.As a result, Japanese suppliers are under pressure to build up manufacturing operations. Apple, which usually prefers to have multiple suppliers, is in negotiations with Sharp Corp. to procure OLEDs. Japan Display Inc. is moving to build up its own OLED production capabilities. Initial costs could reach $2 billion for each, stretching their finances even before they get any firm orders. Even so, they may not have a choice.If they dont invest in OLED, they will have to get out of the smartphone supplier business altogether, said Takeo Miyamoto, an analyst at MUFJ Morgan Stanley.JDI shares rose as much as 11% on Monday to their highest in almost three months. SMBC Nikko Securities raised its rating on the company to outperform from neutral.The smartphone industry is shifting away from liquid-crystal displays, or LCDs, which used to be on almost every phone and remains the standard for TVs. Now, the most expensive handsets usually feature OLEDs, thanks to their ability to use less battery power while delivering sharper and brighter images. Theyre also flexible, which opens up the possibility of bendable phones and other innovations in the sector.Samsung Electronics Co. currently dominates the market for smartphone OLEDs, making up 99% of shipments in the first half, according to IHS Markit. EverDisplay Optronics Ltd has just 0.4%. But Samsung isnt just the only supplier for the screens, its also Apples biggest competitor in the smartphone market, making it even more critical for Apple to secure new providers if it wants to use OLEDs for iPhones.Apple has lagged behind its rivals in embracing OLEDs. Samsungs Galaxy S7 and Googles new Pixel phones feature OLED screens, and dozens of models from Motorola, Oppo, HTC and other manufacturers also use the displays. A representative from Apple didnt respond to a request for comment on its OLED plans.Apple is said to be in talks with Samsung to secure OLED displays. Sharps capital investment in OLED is part of 200 billion yen that the manufacturer had already committed to OLED technology, part of a strategic plan it adopted with new owner Foxconn Technology Group, itself a key contract manufacturer for Apple. The opportunity is huge: IHS Markit estimates that the OLED-smartphone display market will be worth $18.6 billion in 2018, surpassing LCDs.Most suppliers are planning aggressive capital investment, said Hiroshi Hayase, an analyst at IHS Markit. Because OLEDs can be made of film-like flexible materials, theres a chance to open up new markets, he said.For Japan Display, which has lost 80% of its value since listing in 2014, winning the Apple contract is both its biggest opportunity and risk. JDI already depends on Apple for 54% of its revenue from LCD screens, according to Bloombergs Supply Chain Analysis. The display maker has approached banks to secure tens of billions of yen in financing, according to Kyodo News, and has little choice but to invest in OLED to remain in the game.JDI will have to invest 150 billion yen ($1.44 billion) to set up its OLED manufacturing line, either through borrowing or equity financing. JDI is planning to start an OLED fabrication line for testing by March 2018, according Kazuhiko Kubota, a spokesman for Tokyo-based JDI. He said the company is talking to customers, shareholders and banks about obtaining funding, but declined to discuss the companys planned investment in OLED or specific fundraising activities.One option for JDI would be to enter into a vendor financing agreement, using funds from Apple to build up operations and paying it back through sales of OLED screens. Its a risky strategy, and one that backfired for GT Advanced Technologies Inc. in 2014. Apple lined up $578 million in prepayment loans for GT Advanced so that it could feature tough sapphire screens for the iPhone 6. The manufacturer failed to deliver material of acceptable quality, and GT Advanced later sought bankruptcy protection.JDIs strategy has been to depend on Apple, Miyamoto said. Thats naïve.Formed four years ago from the struggling LCD operations of Sony Corp., Toshiba Corp. and Hitachi Ltd, JDI is 36 owned by Innovation Network Corp. of Japan, a government entity created in 2009 to support key technology businesses. Japan Display went public in 2014, and after posting a profit that year, has been losing money. While revenue has climbed each year, its now projected to decline 9% in the current fiscal year through June.The company is at risk of running short of funds, Miyamoto said. Its on a tightrope. Bloomberg",2016-10-17,Gjfr4wfuVEMAS1rWM4v5GJ,"Apple plans to adopt the OLED technology for the next major upgrade to its flagship product.

True, investors expect Mahanagar Gas Ltds initial share sale to unlock value for GAIL, which is selling 12.5% stake in the city gas distributor. However, in the overall scheme of things, it may not amount to much. For perspectiveat the higher end of the price band of Rs.380-421 per share, GAIL will fetch about Rs.520 crore through the offer for sale while its market capitalization on Thursday was Rs.47,618 crore.

A recovery in its petrochemicals business is on the cards. Overall, fiscal year 2016 was a challenging one. Stand-alone pre-tax and one-time earnings declined by a fourth from a year earlier to Rs.3,173 crore. The petrochemicals business has been a major source of pain what with the segment posting earnings before interest and taxes (Ebit) loss of Rs.807 crore in FY16. Performance was impacted on account of lower sales volume and weaker prices.However, the business is expected to swing to profit this year. The re-negotiation of RasGas long-term LNG (liquefied natural gas) contract at lower prices is expected to reduce raw material costs, helping petrochemicals performance. GAIL has commissioned its petrochemical plant expansion in Pata (Uttar Pradesh) with capacity of 0.4 million tonnes per annum or MMPTA (taking total capacity to 0.81 MMPTA). Accordingly, the segment should also benefit from a gradual ramp up in volume. Further, if crude oil prices continue to rise, an improvement in petrochemicals prices can be expected.Also Read: Mahanagar Gas IPO gets subscribed 64.51 times

-0.57,"Investors in Aditya Birla Nuvo Ltd had been hounding it with one questionwhen will the financial services business be demerged and listed as a separate entity? The company would typically dismiss this, saying some of these businesses were still small and needed the backing of a large firm such as Nuvo. 
				   
				The company has now decided to demerge the financial services business and list it. But instead of ending up with a leaner corporate structure, the Aditya Birla Group has made things far more complicated, by merging Nuvo with Grasim Industries Ltd. Besides, the complicated restructuring will increase the promoter groups stake in the cash cow cement business and decrease its ownership of the cash guzzling telecom business.Before the demerger, Nuvo will be merged into Grasim, which means investors of both companies will be saddled with a myriad of new businesses they earlier did not have any exposure to. The groups chairman, Kumar Mangalam Birla, said in a press conference that the merger, along with the demerger, will create value for shareholders. But on the contrary, with an increasing number of businesses ending up under one holding company, value could get destroyed. The only silver lining for existing shareholders is a holding in the to-be-listed financial services firm. The new behemoth that arises out of the merger will have so many diverse interests, most investors are likely to shun it. After all, each of the interesting parts of these businesses will be separately listedUltraTech Cement Ltd for the cement business, Idea Cellular Ltd for the telecom business and finally the newly listed financial services business. Investors may steer clear of a firm where a holding company discount is applied to so many large businesses.For perspective, Grasims 60.25% stake in UltraTech Cement itself is valued at less than 70% of its market value because of the holding company discount. Until now, for Grasim shareholders, there was at least an arbitrage opportunity, which would come into play when share prices fell vis-à-vis UltraTech Cements share price. In Nuvos case, some investors found the play on the financial services story compelling. There are hardly any reasons to invest in the merged company, certainly not after the financial services firm lists. Interestingly enough, the promoter holding in Grasim will rise from 31.3% to around 38.8% post the restructuring. Their ownership in the financial services and telecom businesses will decline. Minority shareholders of Grasim, on the other hand, have to settle for a lower stake in the cement business and take on exposure to the telecom and financial services business. Since the promoter group is considered the most informed investor, a natural question these investors will have is, Why should we do the opposite of what the promoters are doing? Nuvos shareholders, a far smaller piece in the whole puzzle in terms of their value of shareholding, get to enjoy the same ride as the promoters. But again, they too end up with an investment in a holding company.

Ltd (ONGC), said a person aware of the development. 
				   
				The move is set to secure more time for RIL to resolve the dispute and help it avoid any immediate financial impact. The ministry raised the demand on 4 November, giving RIL one month to pay up, after the justice A.P. Shah panel told the ministry on 31 August that RIL should make up for the unfair enrichment it had obtained by way of retaining the gains of gas that seeped into its field from that of ONGC. The one-member panel, which looked into ONGCs complaints of gas flow between the two companies blocks, had also said that it is the government, not the state-run firm, which is eligible for compensation from RIL.The Mukesh Ambani-promoted firm has questioned the way the government interpreted the production lease for its KG-DWN-98/3 (KG D6) block and alleged that the manner of claiming compensation neither conformed to law nor to global practices, the person cited earlier said, on condition of anonymity. RIL, as the operator of the KG D6 block, has sought arbitration on behalf of the consortium comprising Canadas Niko Resources Ltd and BP Exploration (Alpha) Ltd, the person said. Emails sent to the three companies remained unanswered at the time of going to press. A government official privy to the developments, however, said there was no way of resolving the dispute other than RIL paying for the gas that did not belong to its field. With both sides hardening their positions, the dispute is set to slip into a protracted legal battle. According to a report by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, a US-based consultancy selected by both ONGC and RIL which was relied upon by the Shah panel for confirmation of the gas flow between the blocks, about 11 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas migrated to KG D6 from adjacent fields between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2015,  of which 8.9 bcm was tapped by RIL.

-0.17,"Over a decade ago, one of the doyens of Indian business journalism had written an article, Tale of two companies, comparing two packaged consumer goods makersHindustan Lever Ltd (still not Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) then) and ITC Ltd. Since then much soap and detergent have been washed down the Hooghly and Arabian Seaas indeed millions of puffs have been blown through human chimneys. While HUL has regained its old act by re-engineering itself, ITC has got its new act together by reinventing itself. 
				   
				Till the early 1990s, the punch line of all Hindustan Lever chairmen used to be we are an Indian company whose largest shareholder happens to be a multinational. ITC, on the other hand, used to be less apologetic about its BAT Plc. parentage. Following the eminently forgettable K.L. Chugh era, when Y.C. Deveshwar mounted the saddle, in a corporate coup of sorts with the backing of institutional shareholders, he decisively cut off the umbilical chord and embarked on a mission to establish ITCs Indian credentials with a vengeance. At the same time, with liberalization of the Indian economy, the new generation chairmen of Lever over time shed their trademark khadi silk bush-shirts in favour of bespoke suits when traversing the power corridors of Delhi. However, this piece is not about comparing the two companies but trace the evolution of ITC as an Indian consumer products giant. It is easy to surmise why Ajit Haksarthe last of the corporate Mohicansventured into hotels. It was partly to hedge against the possibility of curbs on the tobacco business and also as a safe haven for the surplus funds of the mother business that could be easily encashed anytime by selling the brand or the real estate. It is to Haksar and ITCs credit that they nurtured Welcomgroup for a long time before it became truly profitable. Printing and packaging (where Deveshwar first cut his teeth) and paper boards were but logical vertical integration.Similarly, one would believe the lifestyle and apparel business was started to secure the Wills franchise. But the real serious diversification was kicked off with ITCs plunge into the foods businesswhich arose both out of necessity and opportunity. Subsequently, it naturally extended to pure consumer products play.The story of ITCs transformation is one of turning a proverbial threat into an opportunity. As the time-worn cliché goescigarettes is a dying industry in more senses than one. With the intervention of World Health Organization and a judiciary increasingly sensitive to the hazards of tobacco consumption, the tobacco industry has had to brace itself for a premature sunset like its consumers (smokers). Simultaneously, there was a need to divert public attention from corporate governance and health (tobacco) to being a socially-responsible organization. This, one would suspect, was the genesis of a we also make cigarettes strategy.The ban on cigarette advertising came as a blessing in disguise as it left ITC flush with cash. Not having a majority foreign shareholding allowed it to enter the food sectorthen reserved for domestic players (except those such as Nestle SA, GlaxoSmithKline PLC and a few otherswho enjoyed the benefits of a grandfather clause). Food was largely an open field with no organized pan-India player barring Britannia Industries Ltd. From biscuits, atta, ready-to-cook or heat meals, it has seamlessly moved to instant noodles, juices and now, one hears, coffee is in the pipeline.For a cigarette manufacturer with low technology and little product innovation except in packaging perhaps, ITCs most remarkable achievement was in learning the ropes of an entirely different supply chain and gaining mastery of a new product category, not just in terms of marketing but product development and innovation. Equally challenging was building a network whichcontrary to popular beliefhad little in common with the cigarette retail channel.The evolution into personal care was even more interesting because here it had to contend with a giant like Unilever with an 80-year legacy in India, international brands and world-class research and development. Making soaps, body-wash and shampoo brands is as different as paneer is from talcum powder. Globally, too, it is rare for companies to be equally successful in both food and packaged consumer products. Neither Unilever nor Procter & Gamble Co. can really be considered to have handled both businesses with the same level of success while traditional food makers like Nestle and General Foods Corp. have by and large stuck to their knitting.However, ITCs real success lies in achieving this transformation with existing, home-grown talent with very little (or practically no) lateral hires at senior levels. ITC remains one of the few large companies that still believes in providing long-term careers to its employees. It is a key differentiator in a fast-changing corporate world where turnover and velocity are the current flavours of human resources management. Changing the corporate DNA and culture is no mean task. If an organization has to reinvent itself so have to its leaders. This is where Deveshwar scores above many of our present day corporate icons. Arguably, he had an extended stay at the top. But Deveshwar leaves behind a new ITC for the next generation.In contrast, the much-hyped Project Millennium of Leverriding on which many careers were madelost steam. Among close to a dozen business ideas incubatedjust about one (water, that too in a modified form) has survived the genetic implant.It was generous of Deveshwar to praise Amul and Patanjali in his speech. The jury on the latter is still out. But, what it does underscore is the rapidly shrinking ramp-up time. What took Unilever 60 years to achieve, Amul did in 40 and ITC in 20. Now, Patanjali has managed to scale up in less than five. A fascinating battle lies ahead between the global giants and the emerging swadeshi challengers.Sandip Ghose is a marketer, blogger and writer.

The norm came into effect on 1 April, 2014. In 2015-16, a total of 5,097 companies incurred a CSR expenditure of Rs9,822.30 crore with private sector entities accounting for the major chunk. Of the total amount, 4,925 private firms incurred CSR expenses of Rs6,462.10 crore while 172 public sector companies shelled out Rs3,360.20 crore, minister of state for corporate affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal told the Lok Sabha. According to the written reply, 7,334 companies spent a total of Rs8,803 crore towards CSR works in the 2014-15 financial year. While 7,108 private companies saw an expenditure of Rs6,306 crore, as many as 226 public sector undertakings spent Rs2,497 crore. The figures are based on the number of companies for which data has been compiled by the ministry. Put together, a total expenditure of Rs18,625.30 crore was incurred by 12,431 companies in the last two financial years. The CSR activities taken up by the companies relate to various sectors including education, health care, sanitation, environmental sustainability, poverty alleviation and skill development. In a separate written reply, the minister said there was no positive outcome of deliberations last month on the issue of multi-disciplinary partnership firms. With respect to having such firms, a joint meeting of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI) and Institute of Cost Accountants of India was held on 24 January. In view of the autonomous nature of each of the institutes and their specific mandates, deliberations amongst them did not result in a positive outcome on the issue of multi-disciplinary partnership, he said.",2017-02-03,H9Uevgb4Dcmqk9wm11Q5GO,"In 2015-16, a total of 5,097 companies incurred a corporate social responsibility expenditure of Rs9,822.30 crore with private sector accounting for the major chunk",company,20:24,"Companies spent over Rs18,600 crore towards CSR in 2 years"
-1.0,"The Ashok Leyland Ltd stock gained 3.64% on BSE on Thursday, after the company surprised the Street by reporting a strong performance for the June quarter (Q1). A slowdown in sales of the better-priced medium and heavy commercial vehicles (M&HCV), which grew 12% in Q1 compared with 44% growth a year ago, together with a rise in input costs had been expected to dent profitability.Contrarily, Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margins expanded 1.1 percentage points to 11.2%. Operating profit jumped 21% as raw material costs remained under control and pricing did not deteriorate much. According to Religare Capital Markets Ltd, net realization per vehicle fell by less than 1% compared with estimates of a 2-3% drop.The better-than-expected realizations helped Ashok Leyland comfortably beat revenue and profit estimates. Revenue grew 10% and profit doubled. Further, the company sounded optimistic on exports. Key export markets were down in Q1 but are expected to bounce back in Q2 and beyond, Vinod K. Dasari, managing director, Ashok Leyland, said in a statement. Tepid exports were part of the reason for the slowdown in sales.The strong show fuelled gains in the stock whose valuation, at 19 times earnings estimates for the current fiscal year, is not cheap.

-0.21,"New York: Four of the best professional poker players in the world spent most of January holed up at the Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh, losing. Theyd show up before 11 am, wearing sweatpants and stylish sneakers, and sit down in front of computer screens. Each of them was supposed to play 1,500 hands of heads-up no limit Texas Hold Em online before they could go back to the hotel for the night. This often meant working past 10 pm. Over the course of the day, Starbucks cups and water bottles piled up next to the playerss keyboards. Chipotle bags lay at their feet. 
				   
				Every time one of the players made a move, the action was transmitted to a computer server sitting eight kilometers away at Carnegie Mellon University. From there, a signal would travel another 19 kms to their opponent, a piece of software called Libratus running at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center in Monroeville, a nearby suburb. Libratus played eight hands at oncetwo against each opponent. It moved at a deliberate pace, slow enough to drive Jason Les, one of its human opponents, a bit mad. It makes the days longer, said Les, an earnest, athletic-looking man who seemed eager to take a few minutes off one afternoon last week. Waiting should not affect me whatsoever, but sometimes youre just like, OK, is this going to be over yet? Libratus, of course, never needs a break. Its different from human players in other ways, too. People tend to think longer when theres more money at stake. The computer plays most slowly on small pots, a result of having to scroll through all the additional possibilities that come from having more chips remaining in its hand. Libratus also tends to make huge, sudden wagers, violating standard betting conventions by throwing its money into the pot in irregular amounts and at odd intervals.Coming from a human player, behaviour like this would be irritating, reckless and, over the long run, expensive. But Libratuss main attribute as a poker player is that its inhumanly good. When the 20-day tournament at Rivers came to an end Monday, the humans had lost $1.8 million. (They didnt actually have to pony up the cash; money serves as the way of keeping score in poker.) Tuomas Sandholm and Noam Brown, the computer scientists at Carnegie Mellon who built Libratus, celebrated the win as the first time that a computer has beaten top poker players at a variant of unlimited Texas holdem, the worlds most prominent poker game. Experts in artificial intelligence have always used games as a way to develop and test their creations. Computers have surpassed the best human players at chess, checkers, backgammon, and go. Poker is a distinct challenge because of the element of chance, and because the players dont know what cards their opponents are holding. So-called imperfect information games require the sort of human intelligencelike deceiving an opponent and sensing when shes deceiving you that computers lack.No limit holdem is the game you see in tournaments, and it has the reputation of being more of an art than a science, said Adam Kucharski, author of The Perfect Bet: How Science and Math Are Taking the Luck Out of Gambling. There was the idea that this game would be safer for much longer from these machines. That idea has been blown up in recent weeks. In early January, researchers at the University of Alberta released a paper based on a contest in which their own AI, named DeepStack, beat 11 professional poker players.Whether DeepStack beat Libratus to the punch is a matter of debate. Sandholm said that the pros who played against his bot were better than those DeepStack defeated. Michael Bowling, the head of the University of Albertas computer program, conceded this point. But he questioned whether humans are at their best when playing continuously for nearly a month. Both men agree that poker AI has just crossed a significant threshold. For them this has little to do with poker itself. Holdem is just a way to find sparring partners for their artificial intelligence programs, and the gains made by game-playing bots will filter back into applications like cybersecurity. This is the main benchmark the community has settled on, but these algorithms are not for poker, said Sandholm, who was once one of the worlds top-ranked windsurfers and kind of looks like Bill Gates. Theyre general purpose.ALSO READ | Work in an automated futureDeepStack and Libratus play an unusual version of poker. The computers are matched up against a single opponent, as opposed to a group of players. The number of chips each player holds is reset after every hand, eliminating the complicated psychological game through which players with more chips intimidate poorer players by forcing them to make big bets. Eric Hollreiser, a spokesman for Amaya Inc., the worlds largest online poker company, said this limits any threat that AI poses to the poker industry. While on a functional hand-by-hand basis it mimics poker play, it is far, far removed from the reality of what happens at tables, he said. There are other experiments going on in less controlled environments. Poker bots have been playing in online cash games for nearly as long as scientists have been building them in labs. Theyve historically played low-stakes games and havent been considered very skillful. But bots are spreading into higher-stakes contests, said Chris Grove, a gambling industry analyst and the publisher of Online Poker Report. If youre an online poker operator, this is probably your number one fraud concern, and probably by a pretty wide margin, he said. The poker industry and the academic poker world have been quietly collaborating for years. Everyone involved remains sketchy on the details. But both the people building commercial bots and those trying to combat them watch the academic work closely. Several of Bowlings former students have gone on to work for online poker companies. At least one has sold bots used to play online. ALSO READ | Five technology trends to watch out for in 2017Of course a lot of gambling people are worried that it may kill internet gambling for money, because people are worried that bots are going to be so good that theyre going to be had, said Sandholm. That could happen, but thats not really my concern. In poker slang, a computer program that can do your playing for you is called a dream machine. Participants in online forums swap notes about when suspicious activity might indicate robotic play  or war stories about how theyve made their own bots. Amaya, which operates online poker operations PokerStars and Full Tilt, employs 70 people to combat this kind of fraud. PokerStars employees call players and ask them to describe their strategies on certain hands. The company has also sent e-mails to players requiring them to make videos in which users rotate the camera 360 degrees to show their surroundings, then play for over an hour with their hands and keyboards fully visible. Bots dont have to be wildly skilled at poker to be profitable for their operatorsand dangerous to the industry. A program that can make modest profits by exploiting mediocre players may be worth it. But Darse Billings, the head of poker strategy at Gamesys, the UK-based online gaming company, said dream machines and academic AIs are using different techniques and trying to solve fundamentally different challenges. Beating bad players isnt just a simplified version of beating elite players. Its a completely separate problem. More than anyone, Billings understands both poker worlds. He studied the game while getting a masters degree in computer science in the 1990s, then became a professional poker player to pay off his student loans. Several years later he went back to school to work with Jonathan Schaeffer, a computer scientist at the University of Alberta best known for writing software that could play checkers perfectly. Billings convinced Schaeffer to focus on poker next. To solve checkers, Schaeffer had used a method that essentially attempted to calculate the best move in any relevant situation, without considering what had happened up to that point. But it didnt make sense to think about each move as an isolated problem in a game like poker, where luck is involved and not everyone has access to all the relevant information. The University of Alberta researchers set out to develop an overall strategy. This entailed looking for what is known in game theory as a Nash equilibriuman approach for playing a two-person game that cannot lose over the long run regardless of what ones opponent does to respond. ALSO READ | How bots will shape the future of workA Nash equilibrium isnt a single ideal style of play. The key to an equilibrium strategy in poker is to play the strongest potential hands while remaining unpredictable. When you bet your strong hands, there needs to be some doubt, said Billings. The team developed a cautious AI, dubbed Mr. Pink, and a very aggressive one, named Agent Orange. Its hard to talk about a computer program that does this without sounding like youre talking about something that to actual thinks. The equilibrium approach drew the University of Albertas Bowling, whose specialty is game theory, to poker in 2003. Sandholm, who sat on Bowlings thesis committee at Carnegie Mellon, turned to poker the following year, and has taken on a similar approach. Sandholm and Bowling started the Annual Computer Poker Competition together in 2006, and have periodically played against top human players. Even as they compete, the labs have been gleaning insights from one anothers research ever since.Both programs took big steps toward the endgame in the last several years. In January 2015, Bowlings team published a paper showing how it had solved heads-up limit holdem, a two-person poker game that is simpler than no-limit holdem because of restrictions on how players can bet. Sandholm and Brown, a Ph.D. student who has been working with him on poker AI for the last five years, held their first Brains v. AI competition against top humans at Rivers Casino several months later. Their bot, named Claudico, lost $732,000 over 80,000 hands played against four professional players. Sandholm said the match was close enough to call a draw, a claim that at least one player disputed. Sandholm and Brown say there are several general areas their AI has improved since then. Claudico played well in the early stages, but tended to make mistakes at the end of hands. It bluffed at the wrong moments, and had trouble accounting for how the odds of the game changed based on the cards that it knew had been removed from the deck. In its simplest form, this is the reasoning that says that if there are two kings on the table and you have two kings, your opponent cant have any. Libratus has improved in all those areas. Its creators remain coy on some other areas, like specifically how it chooses to make adjustments based on what it learns over the course of a day of play.All the details of Libratus will eventually be revealed when its creators publish their findings. This kind of academic work tends to filter into real-world poker in various ways. The Annual Computer Poker Competitions have included entrants that also play in cash games, according to Brown. Bowling said his research papers are popular on message boards for people building bots. Theres this whole separate group of people reading these papers and trying to understand them, he said.Billings joined the poker industry in 2008. Hes one of a handful of people who did so after leaving the University of Albertas program. Most of them have been hired by companies that run gaming platforms. Richard Gibson struck out on his own, starting a company called Robot Shark Gaming that built AI programs for studying and playing strategic games, and then a fantasy sports company called SportsBid. Gibson was finishing up a Ph.D. in 2013 when a group of professional players approached him, offering to pay for software they could use in training. Gibson was only given one persons name, never met any of his clients in person, and isnt sure how many people were in the group. Even though they werent using it to gamble online, there was a stigma, he said.Gibson built multiple programs, and said he designed the software to demonstrate the effectiveness of various strategies; it couldnt play on its own. In his most lucrative year, Gibson made about $100,000 on that project, and his clients paid another $20,000 to $30,000 in fees related to the computing power it took to run the software. The anonymous pros werent Gibsons only clients. In one case, he said someone paid him tens of thousands of dollars to spend about six months building a lightweight poker bot. He didnt ask much about how it would be usedhe didnt want to knowbut the design pointed to a specific application. My clients wanted a standalone thing they could load onto their laptop, he said. I imagine theyre trying to play online with them. At the end of each night at Rivers, Les and his fellow poker pros would order takeout and pore over data about the days action in search of Libratuss weaknesses. Early in the month, they woke up each morning optimistic that they had some new tricks. There were specific exploits we identified in the first few days, said Les. We attacked them and attacked them, and now theyre gone. Libratus was also making adjustments. During the day, the program split its computing power between playing the hands in front of it and what Sandholm described as continuous strategy improvement. At night, the program focused entirely on strategy, using 600 nodes of the supercomputer, the equivalent of about 3,330 high-end Macbooks working in tandem. In poker, as in other games that AI has played at the top levels, computers have developed strategies that filter back to human players. Les said hes trying to figure out how to adapt some of Libratuss irregular betting behaviour to his own game. Its hard. We just simply do not have the mental capacity to do it, he said. If humans have reached the point at which their computer opponents are just too good for them, labs like the ones that Sandholm and Bowling run are facing almost the opposite problem. Head-to-head matches against professionals are one thing. But theres no clear path to turn Libratus and DeepStack into players that could be confident of beating a group of flawed humans. Thats because the equilibrium strategy that the AIs use fall apart in multiplayer games, when the point isnt to play perfectly but to identify and exploit the shortcomings in other peoples games. Several years ago Bowling did an experiment where three bots played against one another. Two of them used his labss closest approximation to perfect play; the third one was programmed to raise recklessly. At the end of the game, the dumbest bot lost a small amount of money. One of the perfect players won big, but the other one lost its shirt. Thats really the hard part. How do you reason about these games if you know youre going to sit down with human players or other programs that arent very good? said Bowling. Youre going to have to be prepared for that.  Bloomberg",2017-01-31,HeRzMG8UNSc8zRMAgds00K,Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence research raise questions about the threat that bots pose to the online gambling industry,competitor,18:36,"A computer just beat poker professionals, achieving a major AI milestone"

				A significant portion of the credit for making space cool again goes to the disruption of the space industry over the last few years by private enterprise. The poster boy of this bright new space is, of course, Elon Musk and SpaceX. From slashing the cost of launches by landing the first stages of rockets through putting together plans to colonize Mars, he has already shown he has what it takes to define space for tomorrow. Over the years, national space agencies like Nasa, Isro, Roscosmos, CNSA, Jaxa and ESA have been at the forefront of pushing humanity into space. That is changing.There are parallels to where space is now and where the Internet was a few decades back. For many years, the Internet remained a project inside the US government establishment. I dont need to expand on how the opening up of the Internet to entrepreneurs changed the world. Space is at a similar juncture where private enterprise is starting to make its presence felt. The next decade is when much of this shift will be under way. The attraction of space tourism has been central to the coverage and narrative that has followed private enterprise in the field. That is only natural, given the presence of media-friendly figures like Virgin Groups Richard Branson working on space tourism projects. But the real innovation driven by private enterprise is going to be in other, less glamorous but equally fascinating areas. Think small satellites, for instance. As The Economist points out, advancements in smartphones and other consumer electronics provide a wealth of ready-made technologies that can enable a CubeSat (a type of nano satellite) to perform many of the functions of a satellite a hundred times heavier and much larger, but at substantially less cost. That will revolutionize everything from weather prediction to remote sensing to telecommunications, and help bring the power of technology to billions around the world in a much deeper and more meaningful way.Then there is the opportunity to develop technology that will satiate human appetite for everything from energy to precious metals. Globally, companies like Deep Space Industries have been talking up asteroid mining. An article in the technology publication New Atlas says, Studies indicate that an asteroid 1,000 metres (3,280 ft) across could yield about 100,000 tonnes of platinumwhich already has miners in South Africa worried because we only mine a measly 130 tonnes of the metal on Earth each year.Helium 3 is another resource which can change how mankind powers itself. The Moon has rich deposits of the isotope, which is hard to find on Earth. If technology is developed to use this isotope for nuclear fusion, the amount of Helium 3 on the Moonaccording to Prof. Ouyang Ziyuan, the chief scientist of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program (Clep)can solve humanitys energy demand for around 10,000 years at least. If finding ways to make that happen isnt a challenge that entrepreneurs must rise up to, what is?While the idea of space-based business evolves, India is in the middle of a revolution as well. A new generation of entrepreneurs is backing itself to change the way we live and do business. Our opportunity in space business does not start and end with cost arbitrage for foreign companies. Our obvious cost advantages must be leveraged as a catalyst to innovate in everything from designing, developing and launching smaller satellites to making bets that can make the difference in mankinds quest for newer energy sources. We at TeamIndus are happy to start the conversation, and we hope many more Indian entrepreneurs will join us on this journey.Rahul Narayan is co-founder and fleet commander of Team Indus, an aerospace research start-up, and the only Indian team competing for the $30-million Google Lunar XPRIZEThis is part of a series of articles in Mints 10th anniversary special issue that look at India 10 years from now.

-0.56,"Indias exporters and importers have for long grappled with the extra charges levied by container shipping lines and their agents in different ways.
				   
				So, it came as a surprise when Indias maritime administration, the Directorate General of Shipping (DGS), issued a circular last week that carriers and their agents have finally agreed not to collect some 25 different charges primarily concerned with imports.Pressure was building up on Indias shipping ministry after a Rajya Sabha panel questioned the government over the lack of transparency and reasonableness in the various charges levied by the shipping lines and their agents in export-import (EXIM) trade.The Prime Ministers Office (PMO) waded into the issue and asked the finance ministry to look into it. The finance ministry, in turn, asked the shipping ministry to find a solution.The shipping ministry then formed a committee led by a deputy DGS and comprising representatives from stake-holders in the maritime sector to identify and examine the grievances of the trade and submit its recommendations. The panel discussed some 58 extra charges levied by shipping lines/agents on import shipments alone, of which there was consensus not to levy 25 different extra charges including the winter season charges, terminal handling charges (THC) and inland haulage charges (IHC); the rest were either not accepted or were yet to be discussed.The committee is yet to examine the extra charges on the export side.The eventual outcome of the committee recommendations is that any charge that is not shown in the bill of lading cannot be charged or recovered.A bill of lading is a document issued by a carrier or his agent to acknowledge receipt of a shipment of cargo. But the question that is uppermost in the minds of exporters and importers is whether the consensus among the stakeholders and the recommendations of the committee are binding without legal backing.Still, what gives hope is the support of the Container Shipping Lines Association (CSLA), a key constituent, to the committees recommendations. CSLA is a lobby representing container shipping lines operating in India.On 7 September, DGS issued a circular acknowledging the consensus that led to the unanimous recommendations and reiterating an advice to the carriers/agents not to collect these 25 different extra charges involved in the transportation of EXIM goods as a good/best practice.Two of the 25 charges mentioned in the DGS advisoryTHC and IHCcannot be scrapped because it is a part and parcel of the container trade globally, says shipping executives.THC is a charge levied by the port and terminals from the shipping lines, which, in turn, recover it from their customers.While the THC levied by the government-owned ports on the shipping lines are a notified tariff item regulated by the Tariff Authority for Major Ports, or TAMP, THC recovered by the shipping lines from the customers is not regulated by any agency. TAMP does not have powers to regulate THC collected by the shipping lines from their customers. THC is supposed to be a reimbursement of the actual amount paid by the shipping lines to the ports and terminals. But in actual practice, that is not the case, according to shippers (cargo owners).Shippers say THC is a substantial amount and sometimes exceeds 70-80% of the ocean freight. There is a big difference between what they are paying to the ports and what they are recovering from customers as THC.Besides, exporters claim that the shipping lines are resorting to a so-called double-dipping by using THC to pass on the trade risk to the shippers.Typically, the money paid by the shipping lines to the ports is a part of their operating costs and is factored in the freight rates.Ocean freight includes the cost of loading cargo containers onto ships and unloading containers from ships. Despite this, the expenses incurred for loading and unloading containers are recovered from shippers separately as THC, leading to double-dipping by the lines.Exporters argue that the exorbitant THC charged by the lines contributes to high transaction costs, making Indias exports uncompetitive in the global market. THC is increased arbitrarily, often without consulting the exporters. The shipping lines have been hiking THC without disclosing the actual expenses incurred by them for the amount recovered. Overseas customers dont pay these charges as they are incurred within the country of export. Shippers have consistently favoured an all-inclusive cost without any of the extra charges and have sought government intervention to prohibit lines from collecting THC in India. Container shipping lines are against regulating THC and have refuted charges by shippers that they were over-charging customers by recovering a higher THC than what they were paying to the port and terminals.IHC is the cost involved in carting the cargo container from the ports to customers inland by road or rail. Both THC and IHC are globally accepted pricing practices. It has to be charged. Obviously, these cannot be scrapped. But if the DGS wanted this to be reflected in the bill of lading, thats a different issue, says shipping industry veteran Sabyasachi Hajara, a former chairman and managing director of state-owned Shipping Corp. of India Ltd. The problem of extra charges has more to do with agents and freight forwarders than with the carriers, according to experts. For container lines having local agents, the agents levy the extra charges which dont even go to the lines; they go to the agents kitty.  What the shipping ministry can insist on, according to Hajara, is that any charge that is proposed to be levied by the lines has to be registered with some agency such as the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) in the US.

-0.99,"San Francisco:  Alphabet Incs Google is redoubling efforts to help developers of Android mobile apps build their businesses as concerns mount that the app economy has reached saturation.
				   
				Under the leadership of Sameer Samat, who rejoined Google earlier this year after a spell as president of wearable tech firm Jawbone, the company is sharpening Google Play Store recommendations with artificial intelligence and expanding support for various payment platforms, among other initiatives.Googles efforts in some way mirror those of arch-rival Apple Inc, which revamped its App Store this year with quicker review times for new apps and an increase in the cut of revenue that goes to developers. Both companies face a chorus of complaints from developers who say they are struggling to stand out in a jam-packed field. Many smartphone users, meanwhile, appear to have tired of downloading apps altogether, especially as messaging services like Snapchat perform more of the functions that once required a separate app.Games remain a focus of the Google Play Store, and Nintendo Co Ltd is building a version of its popular Super Mario Run game for Android, said Samat, who leads product management for the Google Play Store. The store is also expanding to new platforms, including wearable devices, virtual reality headsets and Googles Chromebook laptops. What we are excited about is giving developers that single entry point for more and more of the computing ecosystem, said Samat.Android wild west Google has eased the once-complicated process of developing apps for the Google Play Store, said James Knight, a former Google employee who launched Pembroke, a consultancy that helps developers convert Apple-compatible iOS apps to the Android operating system.The App Store has historically been a little more straightforward, and Android has been a bit more like the Wild West, he said.Mirroring the larger smartphone market, the Google Play Store sees far more activity by virtue of its placement on the wide range of devices running the Android operating system - but Apple claims more of the profits.The Google Play Store accounted for 70% of app downloads in the third quarter of this year, but Apples App Store logged 65% of the revenue, according to App Annie, a mobile analytics firm.A big part of Googles new effort involves emerging markets, where Android is stronger relative to the iPhone. The company has steadily expanded its support of direct carrier billing, a popular payment method in emerging markets where consumers often do not have credit cards. Google now offers the payment method in 47 markets.To improve app recommendations for users, the Play Store has also made extensive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that gleans insights from vast troves of data. Googles Play Store and machine learning teams began collaborating three years ago, and a partnership was struck last year with Google Brain, a cutting-edge research project. The jolt of artificial intelligence is welcome as developers hunt for an audience for their apps, said Greg Cohn, chief executive of Burner, which makes an app that provides temporary phone numbers. The harsh reality is that there are a few apps that get the vast majority of peoples time and attention, he said.

-1.0,"Seattle: Steve Ballmer is pretty bummed out about the election. A self-proclaimed numbers guy, Ballmer said the truth is getting lost in the political rhetoric, and he wants to arm citizens with data to defend against lies by the campaigns. Nobody seems to care about the facts, he said.
				   
				When not jumping around on the sidelines of Los Angeles Clippers games, the former Microsoft Corp. chief executive officer (CEO) has been spending his retirement on the inside of an Excel spreadsheet. Ballmer and a team of about 25 data geeks have been poring over more than three decades of government documents to create a comprehensive accounting of US spending. The goal is to treat the nation like a company and create what Ballmer describes as a 10-K for the government, like the one publicly traded businesses are required to file with regulators each year.Ballmers project, called USAFacts, exists in the form of hundreds of Excel files and 385 PowerPoint slides, many of which require a magnifying glass to read. While the complete report wont be ready in time for Election Day, hes using the research as the basis for a class he teaches at Stanford University. His group of 19 sophomores are getting a peek at what Ballmer plans to publish early next year in the form of a 10-K filing, investor presentations, charts, graphics and a dedicated website.Mary Meeker, a partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, undertook a similar effort called USA Inc. that Bloomberg Businessweek published in 2011. Two years ago, President Obama signed the Data Act, designed to make federal spending information more accessible, while OpenGov and other venture-backed start-ups have sprung up with the goal of increasing transparency. While any effort toward greater visibility is a good thing, the government shouldnt be analyzed in the same way as a business in some cases, said Alex Howard, a senior analyst at the Sunlight Foundation, an advocacy group for government openness who hasnt seen Ballmers report.In Ballmers worldview, data trumps all. I just think its important if you are going to make your case, for you to make your case in the context of numbers, Ballmer said at his office in Bellevue, Washington. Here are the numbers. You dont have to be a rocket scientist. You dont have to be an economist. You decide what you believe. And when things come up that you need to vote on, you need to opine on, youll have the view of a citizen thats informed by facts.A childhood veteran of math camp with an undergraduate degree in mathematics and economics from Harvard University, Ballmer tends to mentally organize his life into rows and columns. He has a superhuman memory for numbers that would impress, and sometimes terrify, his lieutenants at Microsoft. Hed frequently ask detailed questions about a managers business unit, sometimes reciting metrics off the top of his head that no one else in the room knew. Steve sees the world as an Excel spreadsheet, said Kevin Turner, who Ballmer hired as Microsoft chief operating officer in 2005 and is now CEO at financial firm Citadel Securities.Ballmers obsession with government data originated from a disagreement with his wife. Almost three years ago, Connie Ballmer told her newly retired husband that he should focus more on philanthropy. His wife has dedicated herself to child welfare and other causes, and theres plenty left to give: Ballmers estimated net worth is $25.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. I said, Eh, why do you worry about it so much? Ballmer said. At the end of the day, the biggest philanthropy in the US is the government. So as long as we pay our taxes, were doing our part.It was an unusual argument to make, and as with many Ballmer debates, it turned into a research exercise. He scoured the web for a summary of government spending at all levels. He started with Bing and then tried Google. Neither had what he was looking for. So he decided to build it.Working with data, design and academic experts at Stanford and in the Seattle area, Ballmer runs the project from the 20th floor of a high-rise overlooking Lake Washington. One challenge they faced early on was figuring out how to divide the government into business units. After several failed approaches, a staffer suggested a look through the Constitution. The Constitution! Ballmer recalled, suddenly speaking many decibels louder as he got up to diagram the segments on a massive Microsoft Surface Hub touchscreen computer. Its the perfect way!USAFacts breaks down government operations into four main segments based on the preamble to the Constitution. For establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, they chose police, workplace safety and child welfare; another includes military, defence, foreign affairs and immigration; the third has the economy and caring for the poor; and in the last, civil rights, environmental sustainability and education. The 10-K has a section on risk factors, an essential part of public company filings. It includes war, interest rate hikes, civil unrest and climate change. The draft report also talks about America Corp.s customers, using copious amounts of demographic data on US citizens.Researchers collected information from 55 government or non-partisan sources, including from state and local municipalities, going back to 1980the year Ballmer joined Microsoft. They kept analysis and interpretation to a minimum. Ballmers goal is to be completely unbiased. The billionaire said hes an independent and has been an active political donor in recent years, with a tendency to give to both sides. He wont say who hes voting for.Ballmer said the idea that the US is getting worse mostly isnt true. Infrastructure, such as road and bridge safety, is better than or comparable to 1990. The government doesnt seem as big as some people say it is, either. Of about 24 million government workers, teachers account for some 11 million jobs; police, firefighters and the like for 3 million; and military for about 2 million. Add in public hospitals, waste management, prisons and other workers, that leaves just 1.7 million or so bureaucrats.Mark Duggan, a Stanford economics professor who is teaching the course with Ballmer, said this project is especially important as Americans consider the need for spending cuts or other changes to Medicare or social security. What Steve is trying to do is to make it possible for people who want to make an informed decision to do that, Duggan said.Staff working on USAFacts said Ballmer already knows unusual factoids about government spending and demographics by heart. Ballmer, 60, said he doesnt recall as much as when he was 40.The project has helped settle Ballmers dispute with his wife. Government funding accounts for a larger share of many social-services organizations budgets for aiding children than private donations, he said. But economic mobility remains largely unachievable for Americas poorest families. The data helped convince the Ballmers to focus their philanthropy on impoverished kids in US cities with the lowest chances of improving their situations. Ballmer will continue making political contributions as well. He still believes influencing public policy is one of the most effective ways to effect change, he said. We were both right. Bloomberg",2016-11-07,IKynQKmVKvCEfR9CHez92J,Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer is poring over decades of government records to create a comprehensive accounting of US spending in Excel spreadsheets,competitor,21:08,Steve Ballmers plan to make America great involves Excel spreadsheets
-0.02,"The US election is upon us. We watch the see-sawing in the polls with bated breathlast Wednesdays Mint carried a blurb that Donald Trump now has a slender lead over Hillary Clinton. The truth is we will not know the result until all is said and done on 8 November.
				   
				While I am apolitical, at least in public, I cant help but observe with interest the political process itself, and to note how this process has been affected in so many ways by the use, misuse and timing of data. Never has a US election campaign been smudged with as much invective as the current one. Mutual hatred seems to be the one constant theme, and constructive debate on the issues, both inside America and within its large sphere of global influence, has been pushed to the fringes. And much of what lies at the core of this shift to hatred is the use and misuse of data in ways that one simply couldnt imagine a few years ago.Data never dies in the Internet age. Everything one has ever written or has been recorded saying is saved forever, in some obscure server somewhere on the planet. Going in and deleting data doesnt work either. It can simply be recovered, even by a hacker with limited skills. Try pulling out of Facebook, for example. While your account will be shut down, Facebook will tell you that you are better off deactivating it so you can come back to it at some future time. It brings to mind Don Henley and Glenn Freys immortal line from the song Hotel California, the Eagles greatest hit, which says you can check out, but you can never leave.Data is now referred to in zetabytes (where one zetabyte is equivalent to one trillion gigabytes). Studies show that in 2006, the Internet produced about 0.16 zetabytes of data, which then grew at a compound annual rate of 25% for the next decade, going to 8.5 zetabytes at the end of last year. Someone trawling the Internet is bound to stumble upon something of shock value, which can be used at the appropriate time to completely take the wind out of a candidates sails.The media has had a field day discussing the various October surprises that came out last monthFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director James Comeys decision to reopen the email case against Clinton (yes, those are still live on a server somewhere)and Trumps foul language against women, which was taped and digitized a decade ago. And so they shouldthe voting public has a right to know about these things, and the media, however biased it may or may not be, still has a duty to bring these sorts of issues out into the open when people are trying to decide on who their next leader is.And then there are the ubiquitous polls. For a confidence level of 95% with a margin of error of 5%, all you need as a sample size to reflect the mood of the 300 plus million US population is a sample of about 380. However, poll organizations like Gallup use a sample size of around 1,000 for most of their polls, in an attempt to ensure a lower margin of error, and conduct these polls on a regular basis during the election season. These polls are then made public in the media, and take on more significance each time an Octoberor earlier surprisesurfaces. The New York Times, in an article on 31 October, pointed out that some of these surprises were held out as events that were true turning points that permanently shifted the race, but in truth, while many of the polls have shifted back and forth, and despite state maps, FBI flip-flops and Bayesian flips which involve sophisticated statistical reasoning, we are no closer to knowing who will win the race.What say you, fans of analytics and big data? If we have truly crossed the chasm of being able to understand how data functions and how it can lead businessesand by extension, election campaignsinto making the right decisions, we should not be where we are. Given all the so-called intelligent data algorithms that have been written over the past few years, a clear winner should have emerged some time ago. These same algorithms have been guiding the decisions made by businesses for a while nowespecially with respect to strategic decisions and shifts in company direction based on consumer behaviour. In a world where corporations have had to make binary choices (either path X or path Y, but not both), these algorithms fall short.The New York Times piece goes on to say that this may well be because many voters are still undecided, or like me, will refuse to divulge their choice to a pollster. These voters sit on the margin, which is where the final result always lies in a binary choice; they will be the ones who finally decide who wins on Tuesday. It also points out that a majority of voters dislike both candidates and would prefer not to vote for either of them. This is a sad state of affairs for American polity. That said, in a quote variously attributed to Alexis de Tocqueville and to Joseph de Maistrethe people get the government they deserve.And the big data experts get back to the drawing board to continue to create fear, uncertainty and doubtall of which can only result in more business for them and their ilk.Siddharth Pai is a world-renowned technology consultant who has personally led over $20 billion in complex, first-of-a-kind outsourcing transactions.",2016-11-08,IPLgVL2bWf1JSABCgqclHI,"Big Data experts get back to the drawing board to continue to create fear, uncertainty and doubtall of which can only result in more business for them and their ilk",company,00:39,Big Data and the US election
0.05,"Britannia Industries Ltd saw sustained volume growth in the September quarter and also reported a pickup in the biscuits market that augurs well for the future. A fall in its margins left investors fretting, but a bigger worry is the effect of the currency exchange drive on consumption in the near term. All told, its shares are down by 7.7% from a week ago.
				   
				The companys stand-alone performance showed a 12.1% increase in sales while its costs rose by a significantly higher 17.7%. Sugar prices appear to be the main culprit although some firming up is visible in other key inputs too, such as oil and flour. Its operating profit margin declined by 70 basis points from a year ago and its net profit rose by 10.7%. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Taking across-the-board price hikes and passing on the full cost increase is difficult, given stiff competition and weak demand conditions. Britannias results statement hints as much, when it says its focus is to remain competitive and gain market share. The management expects the improvement seen in the biscuits market sales to continue, given the good monsoon and pay hikes for central government employees.The companys base business volume growth rose by 10% in the quarter, maintaining levels seen in the past two quarters. Its consolidated business, which includes the dairy and overseas segments, saw sales grow by 11% while costs grew by 17.2% and here, its operating profit margin narrowed by 92 basis points. Net profit growth was a mere 5.8%. Investors in the company are not accustomed to low earnings growth and would be hoping this is a blip. That explains the wobble in its share price.What next? The increase in raw material prices is a trend that has sustained. If the uptrend in biscuit sales continues, companies will be more confident of taking price hikes to pass on higher costs. The current dip in margins should not be a long-term concern then. Consumers are likely to postpone discretionary/impulse purchases, which is likely to affect Britannia. That may keep the shares under pressure for some time till a clearer picture on the impact on consumption emerges. If the worry clouds over consumption blow away in a few months and biscuit market sales resume their upward march, Britannia is primed to take advantage of it.",2016-11-15,IQsABakIUyjhNEyD671WbN,"A fall in its margins left Britannia investors fretting, but a bigger worry is the effect of the currency exchange drive on consumption in the near term",competitor,07:46,Q2 results: Britannia short-changed in the near term
-0.11,"New Delhi/London: Buyers of Airbus Group SEs troubled re-engined A320 narrow-body jet are preparing for delays to the aircraft extending into next year as they scale back fleet plans and seek compensation.
				   
				IndiGo, Indias biggest airline, will operate fewer of the A320neo jets in the current financial year than previously estimated, while AerCap Holdings NV, which has more than 220 on order, said it expects the delays to continue into 2017. US-based Air Lease Corp. said last week its discussing financial remedies with the European planemaker with as many as eight deliveries now expected to be delayed next year.Output of the A320neo is being disrupted by manufacturing delays at Pratt and Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp. that builds the planes geared turbofan engine. Pratt in September cut this years delivery target to 150 engines from 200, saying it couldnt produce certain parts fast enough.Theres a lot of uncertainty around the exact timetable for deliveries at the moment particularly those that are powered by the geared turbofan, AerCap chief executive officer (CEO) Aengus Kelly said in a telephone interview. He said he expects more clarity before the end of the year.AerCap, the worlds largest independent lessor, has received only two of the 16 A320neos slated for the fourth quarter and said it doesnt know how many of deliveries would slide into 2017.We are working closely with our customer to resolve the issue and minimize any impact to their operations, Pratt said in an emailed statement. The company has said that the engine is achieving 99.9% dispatch reliability while meeting promised performance on fuel burn and emissions reduction.The A320neo is also powered by engines made by CFM International, a venture between General Electric Co. and Safran SA. CFM hasnt seen delays. Some customers for the narrow-bodies are placing orders without choosing between Pratts turbine or its rival built by CFM International, AerCaps Kelly said.AirAsia Bhd., Airbuss top customer, received its first A320neos with the CFM engines in September. The Malaysian budget carrier is in talks with Airbus to bring forward deliveries for 2017, AirAsia Group CEO Tony Fernandes has said.IndiGo is now expecting to fly 20 A320neos at the end of March, compared with an earlier target of 24, president Aditya Ghosh said on a conference call on Tuesday. To offset the impact, the carrier operated by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd will deploy used aircraft on short-term leases, Ghosh said.The Indian carrier, Airbuss biggest customer for the A320neo jets with 430 on order, took its first aircraft in March. The company, which has a contract with Pratt to provide power systems for the first 150 planes, is closely watching the performance of CFMs competing powerplants, Ghosh said.John Plueger, CEO of Air Lease, said on 3 November that the geared turbofan engine has so far performed well in service. He said Airbus told Air Lease that some or all of its eight Pratt-powered A320neo and A321neos scheduled for 2017 may be delayed.Airbus has had to allocate those engines as a scarce resource. Who those engines go to is a matter of debate and argument, Plueger said. Every airline and every lessor is saying, We want ours first.InterGlobe, which reported second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, said engine issues hurt IndiGos on-time performance and cancellation rates during the three months through September. The company posted a 24% jump in after-tax profit to Rs1.4 billion for the period, missing the Rs1.8 billion expected by analysts, according to an average of six estimates compiled by Bloomberg.The roll-out of the A320neo, which first went into service with Deutsche Lufthansa AG in January, has been marred by several engine issues. At the outset, a cooling problem with the powerplant required operators to delay start-up under certain conditions so it could reach the right operating temperature.

				Calgary-based Niko Resources Ltd, which holds 10% interest in RIL-operated KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block, said the partners believe they are not liable for the amount claimed by the government of India. In an emailed statement, it said it is considering joining RIL in invoking the dispute resolution mechanism in the production sharing contract (PSC). The oil ministry had on 3 November issued a notice to RIL, Niko and UKs BP plc seeking $1.47 billion for producing in the seven years ended 31 March 2016 about 338.332 million British thermal units of gas that had seeped or migrated from state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp.s (ONGC) blocks into adjoining KG-D6 in Bay of Bengal. After deducting $71.71 million royalty paid on the gas produced and adding an interest at the rate of Libor plus 2%, totalling $149.86 million, a total demand of $1.55 billion was made on RIL, BP and Niko. RIL had on Friday stated that it proposes to invoke the dispute resolution mechanism in the PSC and issue a notice of arbitration to the government. RIL remains convinced of being able to fully justify and vindicate its position that the governments claim is not sustainable, the company had said, adding it has worked within the boundaries of the KG-D6 block awarded to it and has complied with all applicable regulations and provisions of the PSC. The claim of the government is based on misreading and misinterpretation of key elements of the PSC and is without precedent in the oil and gas industry, anywhere in the world, it had said.

				One area that we wish to focus upon is private hospitals which were not ready to accept cash, despite the 72-hour exemption being given to them by the government. Many people dont have cards and even if they are banked, they dont know how to use these services. So, our target customers will be such people, Upasana Taku, co-founder of MobiKwik, said.MobiKwik is also planning to tie up with several unorganized shops in Delhi's Janpath and Sarojini Nagar markets in the coming months, besides Gurgaon where it already has a presence. Customers can buy goods from these shops and give their quick response (QR) code to the shopkeeper. The QR code is used to store information readable by camera or smartphone.The payment will be deducted from the customers wallet and paid in to the shopkeepers. To provide this service from the suppliers end, MobiKwik usually charges supermarkets or grocery shops it has tied up with a fee, but no such charge will apply to these stand-alone shops.With the aim of doubling its transaction volume to 100 million per month, Oxigen is thinking likewise.We wish to sign up 50,000 new offline merchants by March 2017 which will be standalone shops, convenience stores, eateries which are specifically not on digital payments or Point of Sale (PoS), Sunil Kulkarni, deputy managing director, Oxigen said.Keen on making its offline network strong, Paytm also acquired Shopsity, ET Tech.com reported on 11 November.

0.38,"San Francisco: Apple Inc. announced that its anticipated AirPods, a pair of wireless headphones, will no longer ship this month as planned. The AirPods were introduced in September alongside the iPhone 7, which was designed without a standard headphone jack.
				   
				We dont believe in shipping a product before its ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers, Trudy Muller, an Apple spokeswoman, said on Wednesday. Apple didnt provide a technical reason for the delay nor a new shipping date.The delay comes on the eve of Apples scheduled on Thursday event for its updated Mac computer line, when the AirPods availability also was expected to be announced.The AirPods delay is the first hardware-related postponement in more than five years from the Cupertino, California-based company. A version of the iPhone 4 in the colour white was announced in June 2010, but didnt ship to customers until April 2011 because of a production problem. On the software side, Apple delayed the release of iTunes 11 in 2012 by a month to fix bugs.Reviews of pre-production models of the AirPods suggested the device needed fine-tuning. During my testing one of the AirPods had trouble holding a charge, so Apple swapped it out, Walt Mossberg, of the technology website The Verge, wrote in September. Other reviewers noticed problems with music playback, a key feature of the AirPods.The introduction of the product spurred criticism that the cordless earphones could easily be lost. Comedian Conan OBrien mocked the device with a spoof of an iPod ad that showed people dancing and the AirPods flying out their ears into a sewage drain.The device is planned as part of a growing number of accessories that work around Apples most important product, the iPhone. Chief design officer Jony Ive last month referred to the AirPods as the start of a new wireless future for the company. The $159 accessory comes with a charging case that doubles as a mechanism to initially pair the headphones to the iPhone. With iCloud, the AirPods can automatically be matched with other Apple devices like computers and watches.

It had a net profit of Rs113.13 crore in the same period a year ago.
				   
				IndiGo, which has the largest market share in the domestic aviation market, saw its total revenue from operations surge to Rs4,166.93 crore in the latest September quarter. The same stood at Rs3,539.93 crore in the year-ago period, according to a BSE filing.The no-frills carrier reported higher profit despite total expenses going up to Rs4,090.18 crore in the 2016 September quarter. For the quarter, passenger revenues were Rs3,597.88 crore, an increase of 18%, while ancillary revenues stood at Rs558.41 crore, a rise of 17.7% compared with the same period last year, the filing said. We are pleased to report another profitable quarter and traffic growth of 32.7%.

-0.58,"Jyothy Laboratories Ltds share rose 4% on Tuesday. It has gained 22.7% in the last one month, outperforming the S&P BSE FMCG index, which is up a mere 1%.
				   
				The Jyothy Laboratories stocks rise began some days after its June quarter results were declared. That quarter saw its sales rise by 8.9% in value, lower than the 10.2% volume growth it returned. Thats a good volume growth to have, at a time when overall growth is slowing. The market expectation would be that the company can keep up this level of volume sales growth, especially as consumption growth is expected to revive, first in urban and then in rural parts of the country.Jyothy Laboratories had said that urban demand has improved though rural demand is yet to pick up, after its results were declared. A good monsoon is expected to pep up rural demand to an extent. What stands out in the companys case is it attained this growth despite an 11.3% decline in household insecticide sales. This segment contributes 8% of sales. An extended summer hit sales growth in this segment.Sales in fabric care, its main segment, rose by 10.8% and in dishwashing by 9.9%. These two segments contributed to over three-fourths of sales during the quarter. Its flagship Ujala fabric whiteners sales rose by 10% with the Henko brands growing by 9.6%. Personal care is a relatively small segment but did well with sales rising by 14.1%.Although sales grew in single digits, operating profit rose by 17.1% and margin gained by 1.3 percentage points over a year ago. Apart from a lower increase in raw material costs, advertisement and sales promotion expenses were flat during the quarter. Net profit rose by a much higher 77.9% but this was chiefly due to lower tax incidence during the quarter, although finance costs declined too.The rise in the stock signals high expectations that investors expect the companys operating performance will continue to be robust. That can also mean a continued improvement in its cash flows. In fiscal year 2016, Jyothy Laboratories net cash generated from operations rose by 24.5% to Rs191.5 crore. That should help partially fund its debt repayments. Debentures worth Rs400 crore  come up for repayment in November.Jyothy Laboratories shares are quite expensive, valued at 43 times estimated earnings, according to analyst estimates compiled by Reuters. Earlier, in June its shares had run-up on speculation that Henkel AG and Co. may exercise its option (which was pursuant to Jyothys acquisition of Henkel India in 2011) to take up to a 26% stake in the company in FY17.

				In a surprise decision, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday night had announced withdrawal of Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes from circulation in a bid to flush out black money. The move seems to have had a positive impact on movement towards the cashless economy.According to the NPCI officials, RuPay usage on PoS and e-commerce sites in the last two days (9 and 10 November) almost doubled to around 8 lakh transactions a day compared with a daily average of 4 lakh transactions earlier.It is heartening to witness a good number of first time users at PoS terminals. Using the PoS is even simpler than using on ATM. When there are restrictions on withdrawal of cash in the aftermath of demonetization of notes, usage of payment cards at PoS for all day-to-day purchases is the ideal way to transact, said A. P.

1.0,"London/ Hong Kong: HSBC Holdings Plc reported third-quarter profit that beat analysts estimates as chief executive officer Stuart Gulliver pared costs and bolstered the lenders capital cushion. The shares jumped by the most in two months in Hong Kong.
				   
				Adjusted pretax profit, which excludes one-time items, rose 7% from a year earlier to $5.59 billion, Europes largest bank said in a statement on Monday. That compared with the $5.29 billion average estimate of five analysts compiled by Bloomberg News.A UK regulators altered treatment of HSBCs stake in Chinas Bank of Communications Co. cut the British banks risk-weighted assets by $120.9 billion. That freed up $5.6 billion, which increased the lenders capital ratio and will help to support its dividend and any future share buybacks, as well as providing a buffer for the continuing uncertain regulatory environment, Gulliver said.This should be enough to allow the bank to maintain the dividend next year, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analysts led by Chirantan Barua said in a note. For yield investors who have been the source of support for valuation of this stock, this keeps the stock in the safety zone into the next six to nine months.The companys shares rose 2.3% in Hong Kong as of 1.28pm after earlier gaining as much as 3%.The banks common equity Tier 1 ratio rose to 13.9% from 12.1% three months earlier. That beat estimates of Morgan Stanley analysts, who expected an improvement to 12.9%.Almost six years into his tenure, Gulliver is striving to maintain revenue while paring global operations to trim $5 billion of annual expenses. His efforts to redeploy more assets into Asia have been complicated by Chinas slowing economy, while the bank is also navigating tougher capital rules, low interest rates and misconduct scandals.The stock had climbed 11% in London this year, the second-most among major European lenders behind Standard Chartered Plc at Fridays close. Both get the vast majority of their profit in Asia and report in dollars, limiting the impact of Britains vote to leave the European Union. Even so, HSBC still trades below its book value.Adjusted revenue gained 2.4% to $12.8 billion. Adjusted operating costs fell 3.5% to $7.25 billion, compared with the $7.33 billion average estimate of the five analysts surveyed.Since Gulliver started restructuring the bank in 2011, hes slashed headcount by about 44,000 and pledged 25,000 cuts last year, exiting at least 80 businesses. Globally, its retreated to 71 countries and territories from 88. Nevertheless, as with most European lenders, HSBC has been struggling to boost profitability. In August, management removed a target to surpass a 10% return on equity by the end of 2017, citing economic and political uncertainties, and stepped back from its progressive dividend policy.Adjusted pretax profit in Asia climbed 10% to $3.8 billion in the quarter from a year earlier, while Europe reported a 5.4% gain to $863 million.At the retail banking and wealth management division, adjusted profit rose to $1.8 billion from $1.5 billion a year earlier. In global banking and markets, which houses the investment bank, adjusted profit jumped to $2.5 billion from $1.93 billion in the period. The gain was primarily driven by the banks fixed-income businesses, which gained market share in Europe, HSBC said.Finance director Iain Mackay has said revenue is suffering because of record-low interest rates around the world, a particular problem for HSBC because it houses more than $400 billion of surplus deposits. Mackay said in August the lender would lose about $100 million of net interest income a year as a result of the Bank of England cutting its main interest rate by 25 basis points after Brexit.Adjusted loan impairment charges increased to $566 million in the third quarter from $434 million a year earlier.

				The Nikkei India Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), which tracks services sector firms on a monthly basis, stood at 48.7 in January, as against 46.8 in December 2016. A score above 50 denotes expansion and one below this level means contraction. While the index remained in the contraction zone for the third straight month, an improvement in the reading from the previous months level signalled that the sector is heading towards stabilization. Indias pivotal services sector remained in contraction territory in the opening month of 2017, with both new business and activity falling for the third straight month, said Pollyanna De Lima, economist at IHS Markit, and author of the report. ALSO READ: RBI may go for 25 bps repo rate cut next week: Deutsche BankThe survey further showed that input cost inflation slowed since December whereas average selling prices shrank again, which may prompt the RBI to go in for an accommodative monetary policy. PMI price indicators point to relatively muted inflationary pressures in the private sector economy. As such, there is room for accommodative monetary policy, Lima said. The Reserve Banks next policy review is scheduled for 8 February. While the PMI index has remained in contraction zone since November, some firms pointed to improved market conditions following the close of the window for exchanging high-value banknotes. ... a rebound in the near term is likely as rates of reduction softened and business confidence improved on the back of hopes that market conditions will soon normalize, Lima added.

1.0,"Mumbai: When Dilip Shanghvi wants something, he has a track record of getting it. 
				   
				One executive, Srinivas Lanka, recalls the founder of Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd calling more than 100 times over three years with a job offer two decades ago. Shanghvi was setting off on an acquisition-fueled strategy to transform his small generic drugmaker into an industry powerhouse, and he wouldnt take no for an answer.In the end, Shanghvi won over Lanka, who agreed to leave his job at global pharma giant Novartis AG and sign on as the executive director in charge of Suns Indian business in 1996, staying until 1999. A lot of entrepreneurs used to call me, but not many had this kind of fire in their belly, said Lanka. I thought this guy has some different blood in him.That kind of relentless drive has helped make Sun Indias biggest drugmaker and best performing stock over the last 20 yearsand Shanghvi the countrys second richest person, with an estimated net worth of $15 billion. Yet now, with Suns shares on track for their worst annual decline since 2008, Shanghvi, 61, has seen his deal-making mystique called into question as Sun faces an array of challenges at home and abroad.Shanghvis largest ever deal, the purchase of Indian rival Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd in 2015, has been bogged down by a slowdown in emerging markets and bans by US regulators at acquired factories that threaten his record as a turnaround artist. Meanwhile, the political uproar over drug prices in the US means additions to Suns portfolio there that have driven revenue and the share price look increasingly unsustainable.After 15 years where sales grew at a compound annual rate of about 30%, Sun this year has forecast growth would slow to between 8 and 10%, according to company statements. The shares have tumbled more than 7% this year.Nothing is visible at the moment which will provide positive upside, said Ranjit Kapadia, an analyst covering the stock at Centrum Broking Pvt. Ltd. Theres nothing on the plate.Shanghvi declined to be interviewed for this story.Theres no denying that Shanghvi, who graduated with a degree in commerce from the University of Calcutta, has had a terrific run since launching Sun in 1983. Early on, the company differentiated itself from the crowd of Indian makers of generic drugs with a focus on high-margin psychiatric drugs, then branched into medicines targeting chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease, now more common in prospering India.They focused on chronic diseases much before everybody else did, said Nilesh Gupta, managing director of Lupin Ltd., Indias second biggest drug company by market capitalization. Thats how they got completely entrenched in the market. A chronic prescription is a lifetime prescription, an acute one is a ten day one.All the while theres been a steady stream of acquisitions, alternately bolstering the firms growth or catapulting it to the next level. Since 2001, there have been more than 20 deals worth $5.6 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Always a voracious consumer of industry intelligence, when it came to acquisitions Shanghvi would mobilize the whole firm to do due diligence and look for troubled targets that could be bought at a discount, said Shyamal Ghosh, a former Sun executive director who retired in 2011. Finding weaknesses of the acquired companies was very easy for him, he said.Both Shanghvis eye for value and his tenaciousness were exemplified in the 2010 takeover of Israel-based Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. It took a three-year legal battle to force Taros former chairman to abide by the terms of a previously terminated takeover agreement requiring him to sell his controlling stake to Sun, but soon after taking Taro in hand Sun had ferreted out a way to squeeze out more profit: steady price increases on Taros portfolio of medicines.Since taking control those price hikes have amounted to a 300 percent increase across Taros portfolio, according to data provider IMS Health. The move lit a fire under Taros profit margin, which reached nearly 60 percent last year, according to Bloomberg data.With each year profit margins grew at Taro, Suns shares climbed, setting the stage for its biggest ever acquisition, the $4.1 billion purchase of Ranbaxy. With the success of Taro as a precedent investors celebrated the closing of the Ranbaxy deal in 2015, sending Suns shares to a record.Since then, Sun has led a less charmed life. Shanghvi now faces an array of challenges, starting with a share price which has tumbled about 35% since its peak in April 2015, wiping out more than $12 billion in shareholder value.The exposure to emerging markets Sun bought with Ranbaxy has proven ill-timed as a collapse in commodity prices abruptly sent nations like Brazil, Russia and Venezuela into recession. Their plunging currencies translated into an immediate hit to the 13% of revenue Sun now gets from emerging markets outside India.Worse has been the hit to Suns US revenues, 50% of the total, from sanctions by regulators in that country. With the Ranbaxy deal, Shanghvi bought four plants saddled with export bans from the US Food and Drug Administration because of deficient manufacturing practices. But just as he was getting started turning them around one of Suns own key facilities received a warning letter of its own from the US FDA. Though less severe than the outright bans faced by the acquired factories the warning letter prevented the launch of new US products from the plant and hampered production there, slowing revenue growth in Suns core business as it added regulatory costs on top of those he bought with Ranbaxy.Drug pricesWhats more, the US political backlash over high drug prices that has drawn scrutiny to the business practices at drugmakers like Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. and Mylan NV adds a political risk to price hikes at Taro, which combined with increased competition is starting to make the strategy look unsustainable. Last month, Taro said it had received a subpoena from the US department of justice asking about pricing for its products and communications with competitors. Taro didnt respond to a request for comment.What the street is waiting for is for other businesses to sort of take over from Taro, said Nitin Agarwal, an analyst at IDFC Securities Ltd who follows the company. To an extent thats not happened and the stock had been soft the last year and a half.Sun has requested the US Food and Drug Administration reinspect its facility under a warning letter and cannot say when that will occur, Freddy Castro, a company spokesman said in an e-mailed statement. The company is also planning to submit one of the four Ranbaxy facilities for re-inspection this year, he said, declining to comment on Taro.The Ranbaxy transaction is living up to expectations and is on track to realize the expected $300 million of synergies by year three, he said.Looking aheadNevertheless 61% of analysts covering Sun, including Agarwal, have the equivalent of a buy rating on the company, according to a survey conducted by Bloomberg. Most point out that while it may have been the acquisitions that catapulted Sun to the number one spot it was years of steady growth, fueled by Shanghvis ability to spot the next big treatment area, that got him within striking distance.With the market for the simple generic medicines he built his business on getting saturated, Shanghvi has already begun steering his company into more complex ones that promise higher margins, like dermatological creams, injectable medicines and highly regulated pain killers. Next up is building a portfolio of completely novel medicines, some of them developed in house. All that means increased spending on research and development -- for a bigger, though less certain, payday.Of course theres always acquisitions. But with Sun still waiting on the full benefits of Ranbaxy, Shanghvi has said hes not on the lookout for big deals at the moment, even as theyve avoided totally shutting the door should an opportunity arise.Nevertheless, Suns stock remains becalmed as Shanghvi continues searching for a lever that can return his companys growth to the form its had most of the last 20 years. Those whove worked with him closest in that time say, in true Shanghvi fashion, he wont rest until he finds it.He has an insatiable hunger to grow bigger and bigger, former executive director Ghosh said. Hes extremely focused. Hes not interested in anything else except the pharmaceutical business. Bloomberg",2016-10-13,JO3Q4ROOkEeIKlvt25ZpcO,Dilip Shanghvi s deal-making mystique is called into question as Sun Pharmaceuticals faces an array of challenges at home and abroad,company,09:41,"Dilip Shanghvi, M&A artist behind Indias best stock, now faces his greatest test"
0.21,"Mumbai: Private sector lender Axis Bank Ltd on Thursday said net profit for the December quarter fell 73.4% from a year ago as bad loans continued to mount and provisions soared.
				   
				Net profit for the quarter stood at Rs579.57 crore as compared with Rs2,175.30 crore a year ago. A Bloomberg poll of 22 analysts had forecast a net profit of Rs830.30 crore.During the third quarter, the bank saw slippages worth Rs4,560 crore, largely in its so-called watch­list. The bank had, at the start of the year, created a list of corporate loans worth Rs22,628 crore which had a high probability of slipping into the non-performing category.In the nine months ended 31 December, about 51% or Rs11,537 crore had gone bad, with loans worth Rs2,698 crore going sour in October-December alone. However, slippages from the watchlist came down by 48% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. The bank also saw Rs1,631 crore worth loans slipping outside the list, of which Rs975 crore came from the banks corporate loan book.In a presentation, Axis Bank said that about 98% of the corporate slippages outside the watchlist were old loans which had been on the banks books since financial year 2010-11 or earlier. The total slippages seem to have turned the corner. The peak is behind us, said Jairam Sridharan, chief financial officer, Axis Bank.Provisions and contingencies rose 4.78% to Rs3,795.80 crore in the quarter from Rs3,622.74 crore a quarter ago. On a year-on-year basis, they surged 433% from Rs712.59 crore. With this, the banks provision coverage ratio rose to 64% from 60% earlier.The banks gross non-performing assets (NPAs) rose 220.9% to Rs20,466.82 crore at the end of the December quarter from Rs6,378.65 crore in the September quarter. On a year-on-year basis, it jumped 257.56% from Rs5,724.05 crore.As a percentage of total loans, gross NPAs stood at 5.22% at the end of the December quarter, as compared to 4.17% in the previous quarter and 1.68% in the year-ago quarter. Net NPAs were at 2.18% in the December quarter compared with 2.02% in the previous quarter and 0.75% in the same quarter last year.Net interest income (NII), or the core income a bank earns by giving loans, increased just 4.12% to Rs4,333.73 crore from Rs4,162.06 crore last year. Other income jumped 45.45% to Rs3,400.21 crore from Rs2,337.78 crore in the same period last year.Deposits rose 9.6% to Rs3.71 trillion while advances rose 10.1% to Rs3.47 trillion.While the banks retail loans showed a 19% growth year-on-year, corporate loans grew 4% and SME loans rose 5% from a year ago.We had earlier expected our credit growth to be in the high teens for this financial year. That might be a little optimistic right now. Weve moderated our expectations accordingly and we should mark a credit growth which is slightly lower, Sridharan said without giving any clear guidance for credit growth.Analysts believe that the slippages are along expected lines.The banks focus has been on cleaning up its books, which is a positive. We may not see much of a sharp correction in the stock price as most negatives have been factored in, said Siddharth Purohit, senior banking analyst at Angel Broking Ltd.Another private sector lender, Yes Bank Ltd, too announced its third quarter results on Thursday.Yes Banks net profit for the December quarter rose 30.62% to Rs882.63 crore compared with Rs675.74 crore a year ago. According to 17 analysts polled by Bloomberg, net profit forecast was at Rs822.10 crore.Net interest income increased 30.3% to Rs1,507.50 crore. Other income increased to Rs998.35 crorea rise of 33.81%.Kerala-based Federal Bank Ltd too reported a 26.38% increase in its net profit to Rs205.65 crore compared with Rs162.72 crore a year ago. NII rose 30.74% to Rs791.93 crore in the December quarter from Rs605.69 crore last year.

-0.48,"Indias largest mobile services operator, two of the largest pharmaceutical companies, a top-tier IT services firm and the second largest tower infrastructure company have chosen the buyback route to return cash to shareholders this year. This is the first time so many large companies have announced buybacks in quick succession; fiscal year 2016-17 looks set to break all prior records with regards to share repurchases. Along with three large buybacks by government-owned companies, Indian companies have announced buybacks worth over Rs.2,1000 crore so far this year.
				   
				Of course, it will be a while before buybacks topple dividends as the preferred means to return cash. According to data collated by Mint Research, S&P BSE 100 companies alone paid dividends worth Rs.1.51 trillion in FY16. (See bit.ly/29xe7dk). In the same period, the amount spent on buybacks by all listed companies was only Rs.1,800 crore.But this may well be the beginning of a trend where buybacks are used nearly as much, if not more, as dividends to return cash. Research by Credit Suisse shows that in the US, S&P 500 companies spent $572 billion on buybacks in 2015, or 1.5 times of what they spent on dividends. For a number of shareholders, buybacks trump dividends both in terms of tax efficiency and the flexibility they offer. Ironically, in India, the government seems to have overplayed its hand and magnified the relative advantages of buybacks. In the 2016-17 Union budget, finance minister Arun Jaitley introduced an additional tax of 10% on any dividend income of more than Rs.10 lakh. Dividend distribution tax already amounted to 20.4% of payouts.For stocks that have been held for over a year, the buyback route entails a tax outgo of only 0.1%, which is essentially the securities transaction tax (STT) applicable for the transaction. Since 1 July 2015, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has allowed listed companies to make tender buyback offers through stock exchanges. For such transactions, long-term capital gains tax is exempt.Earlier, when companies werent allowed to make tender buyback offers through stock exchanges, investors would end up paying a 10% long-term capital gains tax. To be sure, buybacks through tender offers have picked up since FY16.For high dividend earners, the tax savings through a buyback issue are substantial. Bharti Airtel Ltd holds a 71.7% stake in Bharti Infratel Ltd. The latter has announced a buyback of Rs.2,000 crore. If the promoter tenders shares in proportion to its shareholding, it will take home more than Rs.1,400 crore after accounting for STT and other costs. If Infratel had chosen the dividend route instead, the net take home would be only around Rs.1,000 crore.There is likely to be increasing pressure from shareholders to shift to buybacks, given the tax efficiency. One likely pushback is that Sebi imposes a restriction on companies buying back sharesi.e. that they cant issue fresh equity for a period after the buyback. From a shareholders perspective, buybacks offer the flexibility of foregoing the payout by the company and staying fully invested with the company. They can do this by simply opting to not tender shares in the buyback. With dividends, there is no such option. Of course, one can always use dividend proceeds to buy additional shares, although academic studies show that reinvestment is typically rare and forms a fraction of all dividends received.Another peculiarity about buybacks is that while all shareholders are treated the same with dividends, the pricing of the buyback determines which category of shareholders benefit. Michael J. Mauboussin and Dan Callahan of Credit Suisse point out in a note titled Disbursing Cash to Shareholders, Buybacks benefit ongoing shareholders when management buys stock that is undervalued and benefit outgoing shareholders when the stock is overvalued. Since management should focus on building value per share for continuing shareholders, it should always try to buy back shares that are undervalued.This shouldnt normally matter in a tender offer, where investors can participate in the same proportion as their shareholding. Even so, empirical evidence shows that some shareholders fail to participate, even when they are incentivized by a substantial premium. Needless to say, investors need to keep a close eye on the pricing of the offer; but companies, too, would do well to avoid buybacks by paying a large premium.",2016-07-11,JdsOi2pXYKNjGVP8vvJUFP,"Along with three large share buybacks by government-owned companies, Indian companies have announced buybacks worth over ,2,1000 crore so far this year",competitor,01:58,Govts second dividend tax spurs buybacks

Managing director at LIC, Sharma was already acting as chairman since September 16 when the then chairman S.K. Roy was relieved of his duties. Roy had resigned in June, nearly two years ahead of his retirement.Roy, appointed by the previous UPA government, had resigned nearly two years ahead of completion of his five-year term.

-0.5,"Mumbai: Foreign brokerages gave a thumbs up to the budget and were largely relieved that the government did not opt for a populist budget, and adopted a balanced approach.
				   
				In the run-up to the budget, the predominant view was that the government may present a populist budget with an eye on the elections in Uttar Pradesh and also try to soothe the people at large after the negative growth impact of demonetisation.Contrary to the consensus view, but in line with our view, the government has presented a popular, but not a populist, budget, Nomura said in a note.The message from the budget is that the government continues to prioritize macro stability over growth. We believe this is a very strong and positive signal, given it was under significant pressure to tilt towards populism, Nomura analysts added.In a note, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofA-ML) analysts said that the budget seems to have resisted the temptation of a short-term economically and politically expedient fiscal expansion, by limiting fiscal year 2018 deficit at 3.2% of GDP. HSBC economic Pranjul Bhandari also pointed that the government signed up for a slightly higher fiscal deficit than the pre-existing target on the expected lines, but with a promise to continue on the consolidation path. The assumptions underlying the revenue and expenditure estimates were broadly realistic, according to Bhandari.Goldman Sachs pointed that the government struck  a balance between fiscal prudence and growth boost, while pointing that the main concern for the budget was whether the government should boost growth in the near term, against the macro backdrop of the economic slowdown after the demonetisation, or stick to fiscal consolidation. There was some disappointment though, and a pullback from the recent relief rally was not ruled out.That the budget did not have any punitive tax measure (such as capital gains on equities) is a relief; but in itself the exercise is unlikely to lead to noticeable earnings upgrades, BofA-ML said in the note.BofA- ML analysts said that sectors such as staples and cement may benefit from the rural focus, while banks may benefit from the focus on digital and affordable housing. Yet, we see little reason to change our Dec 17 end Sensex fair value estimate of 29,000.

				Rajaram has also entered into an agreement with Subramanian to buy back her holding in the companya deal that will make him the single largest stakeholder in the company with a 51.6% stake.Rajaram, who made the announcement on Tuesday, did not disclose who funded the deal. He and Subramanian both held a stake of around 25.5% in the company before the deal, he said. The announcement came within months of Rajarams divorce from Subramanian in May.Subramanian, who held multiple roles in Mu Sigma, including director of innovation, head of talent management and chief operating officer, before becoming CEO in February this year, will continue to serve on the board in a non-executive capacity. It was not immediately clear if Subramanian will continue to be associated with the firm once the transaction is completed.Due to personal circumstances, it is time for me to move on from the management team of the company and do something different. All rumours about me starting a competitive firm are untrue, Subramanian said in a statement.Mint first reported on 21 September that Dhiraj Rajaram plans to acquire control of the firm by buying out the 48% owned by his former wife Ambiga Subramanian and private equity firm General Atlantic.There has been some uncertainty over the future ownership and management of Mu Sigma, one of Indias hottest start-ups and earliest unicorns, valued at more than $1 billion, after Rajaram and Subramanian finalized their divorce in May.Founded in 2004 by Rajaram, who previously worked for consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, Mu Sigma raised about $178 million from investors such as General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital, Mastercard Inc., Fidelity Investments and Accel Partners in three rounds since 2011. All the existing backers, including General Atlantic, will stay invested in the firm.There has been a lot of needless and inaccurate speculation around our involvement in Mu Sigma. We are extremely excited about being a partner and shareholder with Dhiraj and his management team and look forward to continuing to help build the company for many years to come, Mark Dzialga, chairman of General Atlantic, said in a statement.The divorce between Subramanian and Rajaram followed the departure in July last year of managing director Ganesh Lakshminarayanan, who had joined the company a year earlier. Mu Sigma had hired Lakshminarayanan, former Dell India president and managing director, in 2014 to lead its Indian operations. Chief financial officer Atul Bansal left the firm in March 2015.This apart, a string of senior executives have quit the firm since April this year, including Goutham Ekollu, head of operations; Anuj Krishna, a nine-year veteran at the company in charge of the companys business on the East Coast of the US; Aditya Kumbakonam, delivery unit lead; Manu Sharma, associate director; Adarsh Kumar, delivery leader; and Sankar Sekar, apprentice leader.It would be incorrect to say there has been no impact (from the separation between Rajaram and Subramanian).

-1.0,"Raj Dutt, a 35-year-old home furnishing retailer in Srinagar was among the many affected by the political turmoil in Kashmir. However, this did not dampen his entrepreneurial spirit and he found an innovative solutiona digital solution. 
				   
				Dutt leveraged the newly-launched sales assistant iPad app from a leading home furnishing company to create a new way of doing business. He went to his customers homes, showcasing the now digital product catalogue, helping them visualize interiors on the app itself and taking orders on the spot or bringing over the shortlisted fabric samples when needed. Now imagine doing this without the app, which would need him to carry close to 200 sample books to choose from, each weighing 10-15kg, for each home visit. In Dutts epic journey we find a true representation of the impact a thoughtfully-crafted digital solution can create in the right hands. Digital disruption in retail is often thought of as just a way of creating a new channel to sell, own or aggregate products or services via a cool app or e-commerce marketplace. But the true potential and value of digital is far more ubiquitous.For instance, geo-analytics, complemented by rich consumer data, today allows you to pinpoint exactly the right micro-markets for, say, a handset brand to launch new stores insomething that was based on experience earlier.Digital is not all about business-to-consumer (B2C). In B2B companies, lets say auto components, one of the top needs for customers quite often is transparency of order status and timely updates. Digital provides a strong way of seamlessly creating a platform where the customer can track his order from acceptance to manufacturing and from transport and delivery with pro-active intimation on potential delaysmaking his/her life much simpler. The advantages are manifold but the journey is never easy.We believe there are six key pillars for a successful digital transformation.Disruption and innovationRedefining the business model, from selling to servicing to feedback and improvement, is one of the first steps in the journey. More times than not, the consumer wont have answers you need directly (e.g. Henry Fords famous quip that if he were to ask his customers what they wanted, he would have built faster horses). Our lines of inquiry need to leverage trained specialists to tap into the discipline of ethnographic research and understand unmet or latent needs. Amazon Echo Dot or Google Home are excellent examples of creating a new needa digital assistant that is a news reader, home lighting controller, travel agent and Wikipedia rolled into one.Customer journeys re-imaginedDefining seamless and integrated consumer journeys across all touch-points is next. If technology has defined progress in the last decade, then design thinking is the flavour of the next one. Imagine someone refurnishing their home can shortlist the fabrics you like on your app while commuting, visualize the shortlisted products as upholstery or curtains on your laptop, get advice from family and friends and finally find the nearest store to touch the actual fabric and complete the purchaseall through beautifully designed screens in a few clicks.Agile development and launch Executing these ambitions requires a considered approachchoosing the right partners and technology platform, getting the data right, even finding the right product photography solution to a life-like product display, testing the digital product and planning the digital marketing right. The focus has to be on creating the MVP (minimum viable product) and then enhancing and refining it through each sprint for iterative upgrades.Creating data and analyst capability Data is the new oil, it is said, and the key here is unlocking consumer data at the front end and operations data at the back end. It is possible today to target a person, who searched for a car, with an auto-insurance offer that is customized for him depending on his profile (demographics, interests) at another website that he frequents. Every penny of yours can be optimized to target the right person in the right geography at the right time and the right place to personalize the right offering and maximize the return on investment.Adoption and commercializationEach digital investment should have a clear lens on commercial value, tracked actively through a sharply-defined dashboard. Adoption is among the toughest challenges in the journeyespecially, converting a users interest to not only, say, a potential download, but actual usage, transaction and, most important (but most difficult), repeat engagementwhile at the same time, doing so at the least cost per click.Digitization of processA chain is as good as the weakest link. A sports car chassis with an 800cc engine will not create an optimum consumer experienceneither will the most-innovatively designed agile customer process with a 1990s back-end. Hence, digitizing of the core processes through a clear integrated view of the information technology (IT) architecture and associated applications and making choices around niche versus diverse platforms needs thoughtful consideration.Digital is a realityit is not a dotcom boom or bust. It is already the current way of working and organizations have a choiceto embrace itor die.Rajiv Gupta is partner and head of technology advantage practice, Bharat Mimani is project leader, and Amrita Chang is consultant at BCG India.",2017-01-16,K52MthnRAmw8bKYv3TkwHN,Digital provides a strong way of seamlessly creating a platform where the customer can track his order from acceptance to manufacturing and from transport and delivery with pro-active intimation on potential delays,competitor,00:45,How to unlock a brands true digital potential
-0.58,"San Francisco: Tracy Chou wrote a post on Medium in October 2013, challenging tech companies to tell the world what percentage of their software engineers were women. Surprisingly, it worked: Google, Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and others published their lopsided race and gender statistics, and Chou, then a Pinterest software engineer, became a face of the tech diversity movement. 
				   
				Pinterest positioned itself as a company working hard to hire more women as well as black and Latino workers. In 2015, the company made an unprecedented move: it published a set of diversity-focused hiring goals. It would strive to make 30% of its engineering hires women, and it would report on its progress in a year.Sixteen months later, Pinterest retreated. Despite all its efforts, only 22% of its new engineers were women, and in response, the company lowered its goal for next year from 30% to 25%. It had hit and exceeded its targets in two other categoriesmaking 8% of its engineering hires under-represented ethnic minorities, for example. Pinterest said it missed its women in engineering goal because it focused on hiring more senior women, which takes longer. But its admission that it had missed its mark and would lower expectations was a disappointment. Obviously we were all hoping it would be better and closer to 30%, said Chou, who left the company in June. Pinterests head of diversity, Candice Morgan, said the company sets goals that are challenging and that it thinks it has a 70% chance of reaching.ALSO READ | Why India needs more working womenPinterests big goaland its later retrenchmentshow how tech companies diversity ambitions can come with their own set of messes and challenges. In the two years since tech giants first revealed how most of their employees were white and Asian men, their diversity has only increased a few percentage points  or, in some cases, dropped. Most companies first response was to try to make their hiring processes more blind: stripping resumes of names and pictures, for example, to keep out information that might unintentionally bias an interviewer for or against a candidate.Now, some companies want to do more than cover their eyes. Its not enough to just publish demographic data and scrub names and pictures from resumes. Unlike other companies, Twitter and Pinterest set specific hiring goals. Facebook rewarded its recruiters extra for diversity hires. Microsoft is tying managers bonuses to their diversity hiring after the proportion of female workers fell for two consecutive years. Even small startups  like Penny, a four-person personal finance company in San Francisco thats the subject of the latest episode of Bloombergs Decrypted podcast  are evaluating candidates on whether they bring a new perspective to the team, in addition to their technical skills. Some companies are embracing affirmative action hiring, even if they are careful to call it something else.I have quite a few clients saying, We want to take it one step further, or saying, Listen, we did the unconscious bias thing, and we didnt get a lot out of it, said Y-Vonne Hutchinson, a diversity consultant who works with startups and helped found Project Include, a group of diversity advocates who publish guides of best practices for companies. Its happening in a way that wasnt happening last year.Hutchinson encourages companies to explore new tactics, but she also warns them to prepare for resistance. Affirmative action gets a lot of blowback, but it was one of the most successful ways of getting people from under-represented groups into jobs and institutions they were excluded from, Hutchinson said. Shes African-American, and she said affirmative action helped her mother get a federal government job. I dont think tech has embraced affirmative action because theyre really married to the idea of a meritocracy.ALSO READ | The HR trends of 2017Instead of calling it affirmative action, companies are looking for a policy that looks like that, talks like that, but isnt perceived as that, Hutchinson said. Companies want to discuss equal opportunity without the terms quotas and affirmative action, she said.Should tech companies ignore a candidates background when deciding whether to hire themor should they factor it in? The debate is ongoing, said Chou, who is also part of Project Include. (She said she left Pinterest not out of disappointment, but because she wanted to try something new.)Itd be cleaner and easier if making the hiring process blind suddenly led to more women and minorities being hired, but thats often insufficient, Chou said. Active policies to promote diversity, on the other hand, can strike some job candidates as unjust. People feel its an unfair judgment on them if they get turned down and someone they feel is objectively less than them in some way is hired, she said.At Pinterest, the pressure of reporting public hiring goals could be felt inside the company. That internal conversationWere not going to hit this, and its going to look really bad if we dontmade people haul ass and get their shit together, Chou said. Morgan, Pinterests head of diversity, wrote in an email: Setting public goals focused and encouraged the team to have more authentic conversations and learn more about how to make meaningful progress ... Theyve resulted in the most diverse team Pinterest has had to date.Pinterest asked some of its employees to recommend a certain number of candidates from under-represented groups for jobs at Pinterest, and some workers felt those goals were unfairly distributed, Chou said. Some employees pushed back when they were encouraged to refer the same number of people as a larger team and asked if the referrals should be prorated, she said. It was a little frustrating to hear the grumblings but also not that surprising, as people tend to grumble about any extra work that theyre asked to do, Chou said. Morgan said the company later tailored its requests based on feedback from engineering leaders.At Facebook, recruiters in 2015 were told to prioritize finding diversity candidatesengineers that werent white or Asian men, according to former recruiters who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to talk about their work. After a few months, the recruiters became frustrated, because they said most of their minority engineering candidates didnt end up getting an offer. From 2015 to 2016, the number of women in technology roles at Facebook increased 1 %, and its proportion of black and Latino workers stayed flat. Two former recruiters blamed the engineering departments hiring process, which gave veto power to a small group of engineering leaders that signed off on every offer. Though Facebook pushed recruiters to look for diversity, those making hiring decisions were not held accountable to those same goals, according to the former recruiters.Even when the hires are made, other employees may grow resentful. GitHub, a site where coders can store and share their work, hired consultant Nicole Sanchez in 2015 to create and lead its Social Impact team, which focuses on improving diversity efforts. The team is now 11 out of the companys 600 employees, and it pushed strongly for more diversity among the people who interviewed job seekers, the company said.Some employees groused. Two former GitHub employees said the Social Impact team would question hiring practices and choices and ruled with a heavy hand. The former employees, who declined to be identified out of fear of reprisal from the company, also alleged that GitHub sometimes missed out on the best talent by focusing too much on a candidates background. A GitHub spokeswoman declined to comment.When tech companies talk about hiring, they often talk about bringing in the best person possible and ignoring everything else. For many, best has meant the person whos most technically skilled or who will be shipping code the soonest after they start.But some are redefining best to factor in diversity. At Penny, which builds a chatbot that texts users analysis and advice about their spending, chief executive officer (CEO) Mitchell Lee wanted the companys fifth hire to add diversity to the team. He spent the fall looking for candidates who were different from the four men who already worked there  affirmative action hiring, in his own words.ALSO READ: Snapchat picks London for its international headquartersWhen I say affirmative action, I mean I want to be able to see someones picture, Lee said. If asked to choose between two hypothetical candidates who are equally qualified for a job at Penny, then he rejects the premise as false: Those two people are not equally qualified. Somebody with a diverse background and a totally different perspective is more qualified for the position were trying to fill, which is expanding upon the collective viewpoint of what Penny has, he said.Lee found that some candidates were dropping out of the interview process along the way, and they were often those he was particularly interested in  women or people with unusual backgrounds. He started checking in with those candidates more frequently, encouraging them along the way. It helped. But he said it showed him how much more was needed beyond getting diverse candidates in the mix: He needed to earn the trust of many of them. Its really hard to convey, especially if youre like me and youre a white guy in his mid-twenties trying to tell candidates that diversity is something you care about, he said.In December, after several months of searchingLee estimates he looked through hundreds of candidatesPenny hired a fifth person, Vertika Srivastava, an Indian-American woman who went to the University of Michigan and worked as a software developer at Accenture. The four current employees are excited for her to start. But Lee and the other Penny workersthey all had a saywaffled when deciding whether to give her an offer. Pennys developers code mostly in Ruby, a programming language Srivastava doesnt have much experience in.At one point during the interview process, Srivastava asked the four Penny guys why they were interested in her. They listed some aspects of her personality, and they were blunt: It was also because shes a woman. I liked that they didnt tiptoe around that, she said. She starts this week.Pennys approach is different than that of most companies. Pinterest and Twitter dont talk about quotas; they talk about hiring goals. Stacy Brown-Philpot, the African-American CEO of TaskRabbit, an on-demand job platform, has pledged to make the companys workforce represent the ethnic and racial makeup of the country. She said on stage at a conference in October that in order to get there, the company will need to over-index on certain groups, though she followed that up with: I dont know if I would say its affirmative action.Slack, a $3.8 billion workplace chat service startup, practices intentional hiring, said Leslie Miley, its director of engineering and a diversity advocate. The company actively looks for people outside of the standard 20 schools and six companies, he said, and they value what historically hasnt been valued in Silicon Valley. That means measuring people by distance travelledhow far theyve come in life instead of just looking for a Stanford computer science degree. Miley said that candidates who would score higher on this metric could include those who were the first in their family to go to college, or are veterans, or went to community college.But Miley dislikes the term affirmative action. The amount of baggage attached to that term is horrid, he said. When you say affirmative action, the very next question most people have is, Are we going to lower the bar? So lets not call it that. Lets call it hiring the way hiring always should have been. What I want is a level playing field. Bloomberg",2017-01-10,KBcVjMqer3e46kpPzpRv6I,"Maintaining diversity among employees, yet hiring the best is the next challenge facing the Silicon Valley employers",competitor,19:39,Some tech companies are trying affirmative action hiring
-0.28,"A steady trend prevailed in metal prices in the June quarter. Even as the macro assessment of weak global demand and excess capacity has not changed, the near term gave something to investors to be happy about.
				   
				Take steel. The governments decision to throw a protective ring around domestic steel firms worked. The minimum import price continued all through the June quarter and has been extended. In addition, anti-dumping duties and quality standards for steel (applicable to imports, too) further stemmed imports. While these steps helped, globally, steel product prices rose, including in China. A ramp-up in domestic steel capacity, better efficiency and lower input costs were also seen during the quarter.Companies such as Tata Steel Ltd and JSW Steel Ltd reported a significant jump in operating profits, chiefly due to an increase in domestic realizations. However, Tata Steels European business, too, did much better than expected. Thus, JSW reported an 84.7% increase in operating profit, while Tata Steels operating profit rose by 20.8%.In the non-ferrous space, lower zinc output affected Hindustan Zinc Ltds results, although zinc prices rose sequentially by 14.2%. The firm expects output to recover in the second half of FY17. Aluminium prices and copper prices did not improve as much as zinc did. Hindalco Industries Ltd managed a significant improvement of 64% in its operating profit over a year ago, mainly because of lower input costs and stabilization of its new aluminium operations.International seaborne iron-ore prices held on to the gains they saw early in the quarter, although they have been volatile due to pressure on China to cut its steel output, which can mean lower demand for iron ore. However, NMDC Ltds performance was affected as its domestic iron ore prices have been declining.Since the beginning of the current fiscal, the S&P BSE Metal Index has risen by much more than the Sensex. Investors appear to be confident that the recovery in metal prices, underway since early 2016, is set to continue.The near to medium term risks to watch for are mainly whether Chinas demand for metals will sustain as its government continues to provide stimulus to growth, and whether developed economies continue with their easy money policy.",2016-10-09,KBiddh7FEye8SmitgpmnsJ,"The risks to watch for are mainly whether Chinas demand for metals will sustain , and whether developed economies continue with their easy money policy",competitor,23:12,Metals: the rising tide of prices

She co-founded Pratham Books, a non-profit publishing enterprise to produce high-quality, low-cost books for children in several Indian languages. Nilekani has been involved in development issues for several years. In an interview, she sp aks about how the wealthy can be persuaded to give more to charity, why access to natural resources is important for improving lives and the India Philanthropy Initiative. Edited excerpts from the interview conducted by Bridgespan in partnership with Mint: 
One of the under-reported elements in the new strategic philanthropy era is the element of personal reward and the joy that comes from philanthropy. What do you consider to be your most rewarding philanthropic experiences recently?Yes, you are absolutely right that our brains are wired for altruism and what keeps altruism going in the human race is the actual joy you get out of it. You have to watch out that it doesnt turn into a sort of ego-driven joy. But when I meet children reading the books we published at Pratham Books, it gives me the most undiluted joy. But also at a more fundamental level, being able to work with communities to improve their water resources and then to see what a difference it makes, especially to the lives of women. We have helped with spring restoration, for example, and when communities are able to get sustainable, safe water, thats been a deep fundamental satisfaction as well. Can you give an example or idea where philanthropy can change the power structure?One of the great conundrums in philanthropy globally is that the way wealth creation happens itself often creates the inequities in society. In the ideal world, philanthropy should be redundant or at least it should be at the edges, as innovation or risk capital. But its far from an ideal world; the wealthy are cornering more and more opportunities and resources from this planet. So, the big challenge for philanthropy iscan it engage with the distribution of wealth itself? It is very difficult, let me tell you. Once you are wealthy, you are in a nice comfort zone and want to stay there. So I always look in the mirror and ask, is my philanthropy making the world a more just and fair place? Take the water example; because when people dont have access to water, its very hard to have good health, good income and livelihoods, so I think the work on water is about restructuring power. So also with some of the other work that I do on ecology, I think peoples access to the natural resource base really does make a difference in how they can bootstrap themselves up to a better life.What can be done or needs to be done to stimulate the newly wealthy in India? I think those who are already in philanthropy and enjoying it and making a difference have a responsibility to share their stories widely, and to be very transparent about their giving. That is very necessary in India today. There also needs to be public pressure on the wealthy, and government policy should make it easier to give. The regulatory cholesterol around setting up charitable organizations can be cleaned up. I think enabling non-profits, which are essentially the absorptive pipeline for philanthropy, is critical. And right now there is distrust between government and NGOs (non-governmental organizations), which I think is not healthy. So we do need government and NGOs to sit at the table and say how can we make the NGO sector more transparent? How can we then have less regulation and make it easier to function? I think all this will help to increase philanthropy in India.Can you talk a little bit about the role of big bets in India? Is there a need for more strategic action?I think we have seen international philanthropists take these audacious big bets and obviously the (Bill and Melinda) Gates Foundation comes to my mind, when they deploy their capital to crack some vaccine or child mortality. I mean that sounds like the kind of areas we used to leave to God or at least to the big state! But it is wonderful that people who have become so incredibly wealthy are now putting their intellectual capital along with their monetary capital to say, why cant we just be audacious and crack things that have just not cracked for so long? It has its risks; it always has its risks when individuals use their power and wealth to solve something because unless it comes with a set of checks and balances in society, sometimes you can also go very wrong. But I am all for these big bets and in India I dont think we have taken enough of them. I hope we mature to that.You are involved with other philanthropists in establishing and leading Indian philanthropic initiatives...The India Philanthropy Initiative was set up by a few of us under Azim Premjis leadership. We have decided to take it slowly but the goal is to see how we can inspire much more philanthropy in India. We are learning to see if we can be effective as a group of philanthropists, pushing each others limit. And we are best as a peer-to-peer network where we can freely ask questions and learn.ALSO READ | You really want to be doing things that make a difference: Ratan TataDo you think the expression and experience of philanthropy in India can be distinctive?It can be made distinctive. If we really get back into the roots of our culture and philosophy, we can bring that out into the modern era by infusing it with new meaning about responsibility in society. And you can make it as spiritual as you want it to be or make it just about creating a better democracy. So yes, there is potential to infuse Indian philanthropy with a deeply culturally rooted new meaning. And that is a journey worth taking I think.ALSO READ | Being positive is not a curseALSO READ | Growth of wealth gives way for growth in charityThe Bridgespan Group, an adviser and resource for mission-driven leaders and organizations, in partnership with Mint interviewed several philanthropists across India to trace their journeys and share their learningsConversations with Remarkable Givers: India.

-0.28,"For most companies, big acquisitions take a while to pay offsometimes years, if ever. Thats unless, of course, you are talking about Warren Buffet and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
				   
				Its been only nine months since Buffetts deals for Precision Castparts and Duracell closed, transactions which together totalled around $40 billion. And it looks like the aerospace-parts maker and battery brand are already earning their keep.Berkshires manufacturing division, which also comprises older acquisitions such as Lubrizol specialty chemicals and Shaw Industries carpets, just posted its best return in at least two years.This helped contribute to a 6.6% increase in the sprawling companys total operating earnings for the third quarter, but which at $2,951 a share were still a little short of the average analyst estimate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. (Berkshires profit was partly pinched by BNSF, the North American railroad system that Buffett bought in 2010, as the industry contends with weak freight demand and diminishing pricing power. BNSFs operating income was down 11% year on year as revenue slid 7.7%.)What was interesting about the Precision Castparts deal was that the always-price-conscious Buffett, 86, paid a not-so-cheap price. The transaction valued Precision Castparts at about 13 times its then-trailing-12-month Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization). Thats in line with the median multiple for US mergers and acquisitions (M&A) this year, but that median multiple is also near a historic record.Earlier last week, I noted that elevated M&A valuations could be a tad concerning. But the difference between Buffett and everyone else is that he doesnt rely on synergies to justify transactions. Berkshire also has more cash than it knows what to do withas opposed to other giant companies, which are putting themselves deeper into debt in a desperate attempt to juice growth.Yet again, the Oracle shows how its done. The question is, what happens when hes no longer the one holding the elephant gun?

-0.65,"There seems to be a bright rainbow over Escorts Ltd, after the rains. From June, when it was certain the monsoon was on track, until now, the agri-machinery manufacturers stock skyrocketed 123% in just three months.
				   
				Many factors came together to fuel investor confidence, which continues in the companys favour. At the forefront is the strong recovery in tractor sales on the back of a normal monsoon after two successive failed years. From April to August, tractor sales jumped by 17.5% year-on-year, with August sales alone soaring 55%.And this momentum is likely to remain through this fiscal year as the company expands its presence in the southern markets, which have steadily bucked the slowdown and outperformed growth rates. Meanwhile, Escorts continues to grow in its stronghold markets in the northern and central belts.The sudden turnaround in tractor sales after several quarters of contraction is a reason for re-rating the companys stock. In fiscal year 2016,  Escortss net revenue had contracted on the back of declining tractor sales. Its valuation had so far tailed that of other farm equipment manufacturers like VST Tillers Tractors Ltd, as other divisions dragged overall performance. However, at current levels, the stocks one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple has doubled to around 16 in a span of six months. Another fillip to valuation comes from the managements decision to sell the loss-making auto products division which was bleeding and a drain on profitability for several yearswhich has signalled its intent to focus on the companys core business.But then, profit expansion is important to sustain the current valuation. Yes, besides farm equipment, Escorts is focusing on revving up revenue growth in other divisions like construction machinery and railways too. A slew of new products have been planned across these segments to improve utilization and improve profitability. However, this may take some time to start contributing to profits in a big way.A key hurdle is that the company is saddled with high costsa function of low output and high fixed expenses too. Forecasts by the management to trim raw material costs and employee costs through a voluntary retirement scheme are likely to give a leg-up to profitability. Analysts have pencilled an operating margin of about 9% by FY18twice that of FY16. The caveat, however, is that with nearly 85% of its revenue dependent on the vagaries of the monsoon, the stocks earning trajectory will be cyclical and unpredictable. Unless Escorts is able to stabilize profit margins over a longer term, the stocks valuations may see wide fluctuations.",2016-09-29,KHbAjUP1ySXtnmnSCz5pnJ,The sudden turnaround in tractor sales after several quarters of contraction is a reason for re-rating the companys stock,competitor,23:28,Margin expansion key to support high valuation at Escorts

With output rising, capacity utilization should have risen. Now, utilization did increase sharply at the start of the year, but peaked in June and has declined since.More capacity has been added, partly due to new plants coming on stream, ramping up of existing capacity and, perhaps, restarts of idled capacity.

0.12,"Opecs oil production is at a record high, non-Opec output is rising, US production appears to have bottomed out, and oil demand growth is tepid at best. Throw in the dollars recent strength and it becomes clear why prices, which began October on a bullish note, are increasingly appearing bearish.
				   
				But against this backdrop, Opec has regained some of its lost relevance and the producer groups decision in Vienna on 2 November on restraining output could decide the future course of oil prices.The International Energy Agency has said that Opecs plan to limit production will play a key role in speeding up the rebalancing of oil markets. Without Opec intervention, the market will remain oversupplied through the first half of next year, the Paris-based agency said in its October monthly report.But challenges have emerged on several fronts since Opec announced a preliminary deal in late September to limit production to between 32.5 million barrels per day (b/d) and 33 million b/d. Opec produced 33.24 million b/d of crude in September, according to an S&P Global Platts survey.An Opec technical meeting in Vienna at the end of October, including a day of discussions with non-Opec producers, failed to yield the desired results and drove prices lower.Front-month ICE Brent futures settled at $48.30/b on 31 October and NYMEX WTI at $46.86/b, both down 5% from levels seen on 1 October.Opec had hoped to emerge this weekend with enough parameters of its freeze agreement sorted out to gain the commitment of several non-Opec producers to join in reining in output. Instead, the meeting only served to expose the divisions within Opec, affirming doubts among sceptics that the organization would be able to credibly implement the freeze plan tentatively reached in Algiers in September.And the six non-Opec producersAzerbaijan, Brazil, Oman, Russia, Kazakhstan and Mexicowhich attended the talks were left wanting, essentially telling the producer group to get its house in order before asking them to pledge adherence to a deal that does not exist.The main obstacle has been the refusal of two of Opecs biggest producersIran and Iraqto restrict their growing output, putting the onus on Saudi Arabia to shoulder the bulk of any proposed cuts.Iraq is insisting on a higher quota or an exemption from the freeze as it battles the Islamic State militant group, while Iran argues that it is entitled to produce more, having lost out while under sanctions.Iraq has also been critical of Opecs estimate of its production using secondary sources, which it says severely underestimates the countrys actual productiona point that will make it harder for Opec members to decide which base number to use when dividing up the new production levels and further complicate an already delicate situation.Iraq told Opec that its production in September averaged a record 4.775 million b/d, up 153,000 b/d from August. However, Opecs secondary sources pegged Iraqs output last month at 4.455 million b/d, a difference of 320,000 b/d with the governments figures.The demand-supply outlook appears to have deteriorated. Overall global oil demand growth continues to slow down, dropping from a five-year high of 2.5 million b/d in Q3 2015 to a four-year low of 800,000 b/d in Q3 2016 due to vanishing OECD growth and a marked deceleration in China, according to the IEA.There appears to be no let-up in supply. Opec crude output rose by 160,000 b/d to an all-time high of 33.64 million b/d in September as Iraq pumped at record rates and Libya reopened export terminals, the IEA said, adding that Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates held supply at or near historic highs, while Iran was producing close to the pre-sanction level at 3.7 million b/d.Non-Opec production was up nearly 0.5 million b/d on higher Russian and Kazakh output.US crude production appears to have bottomed out. Output fell to 8.428 million b/d in the week ended 1 July, ranging since between 8.445 million b/d and 8.597 million b/d, according to estimates by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA).The EIA last month said that US crude production should average 8.6 million b/d next year, an upward revision of 100,000 b/d from its previous forecast. In 2016, US output is expected to average 8.7 million b/d, compared with 9.4 million b/d in 2015, EIA said.While Opec takes the limelight, one cannot forget the upcoming US election, which could impact the dollar and in turn oil prices.A key factor capping oil prices in the past month or so has been the strength in the dollar index, driven by the belief that US economic conditions have become robust enough to support an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve later this year. A stronger dollar makes fuel and crude imports more expensive for holders of other currencies, putting downward pressure on oil prices.Mriganka Jaipuriyar is associate editorial director, Asia & Middle East Oil News & Analysis, S&P Global Platts.",2016-11-04,KaImG5LLSshtdzEMTtMzjP,"The refusal of Iran and Iraq to trim their growing output is the key hurdle, putting the onus on Saudi Arabia to shoulder the bulk of any proposed cuts",competitor,02:28,Oil markets look to Opec for a way out of low prices

The NBFC will start lending operations from the beginning of 2017 with around $150 million, including capital infused internally.Apart from the regular residential and office projects, the new NBFC will also lend to projects in the logistics, hospitality and healthcare sectors. Traditional banking channels are unable to fill the funding gap in the sector today, which is why so many NBFCs are coming up. NBFCs are stepping in to address those gaps, said Bedi, chairman and managing director, Rising Straits Capital. Bedi, who also co-founded Red Fort Capital, said that the NBFC will take off with $100-150 million and then increase it to about $300 million of debt. Mint wrote in a 13 September article that Rising Straits Capital was in the process of acquiring an NBFC. Rising Straits is currently also raising capital from offshore investors, through the managed account route, to invest in real estate projects. In a managed account, a few large limited partners (LP) participate, instead of multiple investors in a blind pool format.So far we have got commitment of around $300 million.

0.35,"New Delhi: In order to encourage banks to provide education loans, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has said rescheduling of payment period of such loans due to unemployment of borrower will not be treated as restructured accounts for computing NPAs. 
				   
				Banks may allow up to three spells of moratorium (not exceeding 6 months each) during life cycle of education loan, taking into account spells of unemployment/underemployment, without treating the exercise as restructuring, RBI said in a letter to the Indian Banks Association (IBA). However, banks would be required to maintain a higher provisioning of 5% during the additional moratorium period and one year thereafter. The RBIs response was on a clarification sought by the IBA whether the education loans with extended repayment period be treated as restructured loans. The facility of extended repayment period and increased number of moratorium for repayment may be extended to existing borrowers whose accounts are classified as standard..., said the RBI. As per RBIs master circular of July 2015, accounts that are restructured from April 2015 will attract higher provisioning and will be classified as NPA. In 2013, the department of financial services (DFS) had notified that if the repayments in education loans are extended due to revision in the repayment period, the same may not be treated as restructuring.

0.0,"Shares of Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) jumped nearly 3% on Tuesday after the firm beat analysts estimates on all operating parameters for the September quarter. But order inflows were poor and they paint a gloomy picture of the economy.
				   
				First, a look at the positives that drove the stock price up. Dogged execution and the 12% year-on-year (y-o-y) increase in net revenue were many notches higher that what the Street expected. Along with this, the firms tight control on expenses, be it raw material costs, employee costs or other expenses helped BHEL post a Rs155 crore operating profit from a loss in the year-ago period. This compares with Bloombergs consensus estimate of a profit of Rs68 crore. BHELs net profit of Rs109 crore was a huge 82% above consensus estimates.But one cannot overlook the negatives. In sharp contrast to the profit outperformance was the paltry Rs1,800 crore order inflow during the quarter, down 30% from a year ago. The first six months tally of Rs4,800 crore is barely one-fifth of what the firm secured in the previous comparable period. The order backlog fell to Rs1.03 trillion as opposed to Rs1.12 trillion a year ago. This is of concern as it points to a paucity of capital investment both in the power sector and industry.To add to this, the management, in its analysts concall, has stated that some existing orders may be cancelled. Investors are also aware that a large part of the order book is in slow-moving projects, which may lead to slower revenue growth in the future.If that happens, there is a lurking danger of the firm slipping again on the profitability front. After all, its operating margin was a wafer-thin 2.3% during the September quarter.Lack of orders is a grave concern in light of the firms massive capacity. BHELs capacity for boiler-turbine-generator is 20 gigawatts (GW) and the entire industry pipeline of estimated orders is much lower. According to a report by Jefferies Equity Research, BHELs return on equity (RoE) will peak at 7% over the next two-to-three years. At 100% capacity utilization, it would achieve an ROE of 13%, it says, adding that this is before the 7th Pay Commission changes come into consideration. Obviously, staff costs will inch up thereafter, dampening profitability.The quarters performance was stellar.

				The going has been good for Leyland, the countrys second largest truck maker, in the last several months. Robust truck and bus sales and steady rise in profitability led to a 25% jump in the stock price since last July. It trades at 10.5 times the estimated earnings for fiscal year 2017, a fair price given that the positives are factored into this valuation.In the near term, budget-related indirect sops for the auto sector may trigger a euphoric rally. But a sustained upmove for the stock will come from rising sales and market share. Ashok Leylands share in trucks has inched up steadily from 20% to 24% in the last couple of years, although Tata Motors Ltd remains the undisputed No. 1, with nearly twice Leylands share. Note that higher market share in future would be a bigger struggle, given that there are new entrants like Volvo, Bharat Benz, etc. in the fray.The big bet for the near term is the scrapping of old trucks. Yes, this will force transporters to buy new ones. But the impact for truck makers depends on the age and type of trucks included and the nature and quantum of incentive announced, if at all.The Street is also hopeful that any infrastructure boost by the government will, in the long run, lift demand for tippers, even as general economic recovery raises demand for commercial vehicles. If this happens, Ashok Leylands growth rate could continue to outpace that of the industry on account of its niche product portfolio that caters to segments across infrastructure. For the December quarter, it posted a 38% volume growth as opposed to an industry growth of about 22%.According to Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd, unless government spending and the manufacturing sector improve significantly, fiscal year 2017 could be a pretty lacklustre year.Sustained sales growth is important to improve profitability as only with higher production will economies of scale kick in. December quarter operating margin no doubt was 343 basis points (bps) higher at 10%. But, this came on the back of a huge fall in raw material costs too. A basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.From these levels, higher profitability can come mainly from higher sales.

1.0,"Domestic gas prices have been cut again. This is the fourth consecutive cut since November 2014 (see chart). For October-March 2017, prices have declined 18% to $2.5 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) on gross calorific value basis. What is worse is that analysts expect another round of price cut in April 2017 when the next price change is due. So far, trends in regional benchmarks that determine domestic prices indicate another cut is likely.
				   
				So who wins, who loses when domestic gas prices are cut?Earnings of gas producers such as Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) will be adversely impacted. This comes at a time when ONGC and OILs crude oil price realizations are already under pressure due to the lower crude oil price environment. According to Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd, for ONGC, the impact on revenue will be nearly Rs2,500 crore, with a post-tax impact of Rs2 a share (6.5% of its FY18 EPS of Rs31). For OIL, the impact on revenue would be nearly Rs350 crore, and a post-tax impact of Rs4 per share (7.5% of Nomuras FY18 EPS of Rs52). EPS is earnings per share. Very low production from KG-D6 (D6 field in the Krishna-Godavari  basin) means that the impact on Reliance Industries Ltd will be marginal.On the other hand, GAIL (India) Ltd is expected to benefit from low gas prices. The company uses domestic gas for its LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) production. Margins for the LPG business should expand by ~10% with this price reduction, said analysts from Religare Capital Markets in a report on 3 October. After a 20% domestic gas price cut on 1 April, GAILs operating costs fell sharply, 25% quarter-on-quarter in the June quarter for both LPG and gas transmission segments, said Nomura in a report on 30 September. Needless to say, another decline in prices will benefit GAIL further.City gas distributorsIndraprastha Gas Ltd, Mahanagar Gas Ltd and Gujarat Gas Ltdare expected to benefit too. The quantum of benefit, though, will depend on the extent of gain they decide to pass on to consumers in the form of retail price cuts.Meanwhile, the government has also reduced the ceiling price for gas produced from new difficult fields by 20% to $5.3 per mmBtu.

So, whatever quantity is available, we are procuring that from vegetable oil manufacturers via tenders, said an official of Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL), requesting anonymity. IOCL, the countrys largest state-owned oil refiner, did not reply to an email sent on 3 October. Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) plan to buy a total of 20 million litres of biodiesel from local manufacturers, a BPCL official said, requesting anonymity. Introducing more biodiesel will help India, which imports 80% of its crude oil, to reduce its oil import bill.The country is targeting a more than seven-fold expansion in its biofuel market in the next six years, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan had said on 10 August.Blending 5% of biodiesel with diesel and 10% ethanol with petrol can expand the biofuel market to Rs50,000 crore by 2022 from about Rs6,500 crore currently. For this, India would need 6.75 billion litres of biodiesel and 4.5 billion liters of ethanol, Pradhan had said.We are looking at sourcing more biodiesel to meet 10% blending norm, the BPCL official cited above said.

				Facebook said Wednesday that its revenue rose 51% in the fourth quarter, and it turned 52 cents of every dollar into operating profit. That is a remarkable profit margin, and Facebooks best ever.It was also the fifth consecutive quarter of more than 50% revenue growtha re-acceleration after the companys growth rate had seemingly peaked in 2014. And the number of people who use Facebook or the Facebook Messenger app at least once a month continued to climb, up 17% to 1.86 billionmore than the combined populations of China and the US.Money machineFacebook has already warned its incredible revenue growth wont continue after mid-2017 because it wont be able to keep shoving more ads interspersed in the feed of Facebook posts. This increased ad load has been a significant source of Facebooks recent growth in advertising sales, although it is unclear how much. Facebook also said its costs would rise this year because it is investing more in its business.Even if Facebooks growth slows in coming months, Alphabet Inc.s Google and Facebook keep extending their advantage over everyone else in the digital advertising industry. That gives both companies the lead time and resources to find their next acts, and they are already laying the groundwork. Like Google, Facebook keeps finding new potential hot spots for revenue. For Facebook, those new targets are its Instagram app and video everywhere in Facebooks world. Mark Zuckerberg cant stop talking about how Facebook is becoming more centered on video because it is following the lead of people who are taking and watching more video online. But the focus on video also has the advantage of opening his company to big piles of fresh ad dollars. With $27 billion in 2016 advertising, Facebook took roughly 5% of all global advertising spending. The TV industry is around 35%. That is a juicy target. Digital versus TVThat means the next big technology prizefight isnt Facebook versus Google versus Snapchat, but the digital world duking it out against television. All them have their eyes on the roughly $190 billion spent each year on TV commercials. If Facebook grabs just 3% of ad dollars spent on TV in the US, it would add more than $2 billion, or about 7%, to its annual revenue.To make the TV money come to Facebook, the company is doing everything it can to become more like TV. (Googles YouTube is doing the same.) The company has tried to get more people to shoot videos of themselves and post them live; it is making a big push for Snapchat-type video clips in its Instagram app; and it is tweaking its computer models to emphasize more TV-like longer videos that hook people. Video starFacebooks transformation into something more like TV wont be simple. Its advertising turned out to be ideally suited to the last five years of Internet use shifting from computers to smartphones. Its not clear Facebook has a similar pole position for the shift in advertising from TV to digital video. Facebook has been reluctant, until recently, to interrupt videos with commercial messages as TV does, perhaps because people flee during those digital ad breaks.The TV players arent sitting still, either, and are trying to adapt to changes in viewer and advertiser behaviour. Theyre trying to become more like Facebook, before Facebook becomes like them.",2017-02-03,LSOxWEWnvxP8praR2Qv3CL,Mark Zuckerberg cant stop talking about how Facebook is becoming more centered on video because it is following the lead of people who are taking and watching more video online,competitor,02:29,Facebook wants to be a TV star next

In Kenya, the first two months of 2016 have seen tea output rise by 43% over the same months a year ago, according to data from Africa Tea Brokers Ltd. But thats also due to a low base effect as dry weather had affected output in 2015. If we change the base to 2014, the current years output is still higher by 19.8%. If rainfall continues to favour tea output in the next few months, then we are likely to see a substantial increase in Kenyas output in 2016.Indias tea season in North India will pick up pace later; in 2015, the high months for tea production were between May and November. Tea trading company Van Rees said in its latest weekly report that heavy pre-monsoon showers and a favourable winter in the North have led to higher crop levels this year. In its round-up, it says it expects plenty of tea in the near future. Indias North India plantations accounted for four-fifths of tea output, according to the Tea Board of Indias data, with South India bringing up the rest. Abundant tea output globally could signal weak trends in auction prices. Whether prices trend weak and by how much is an important factor determining the performance of companies. Costs are another factor. Last year, tea company McLeod Russel India Ltd had said it expects costs to increase by 13% due to higher input costs and wages. In the current year, it expects costs to increase by 7%.While a lower increase in costs is indeed beneficial, a decline in tea prices could nullify that.

-1.0,"HeidelbergCement India Ltd, the Indian arm of the German cement maker, turned out better-than-expected revenue growth for the June quarter, but failed on profitability.The 7% jump in net revenue, which beat Bloombergs consensus estimates, was the result of both better demand and higher cement prices. Net realization improved about 3.5% from a year ago as cement prices in central India, where most of its revenue accrue from, have been on the rise. Robust demand translated into higher cement sales.Further, in line with the industry trend, the firm gained from lower power and fuel costs, which dropped by 460 basis points (bps) during the quarter. Freight costs and other expenses were lower, too. Operating margin, therefore, widened by 130 bps; it, however, fell short of expectations. Analysts say this was because the realization on sales was lower than estimates. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.As a result, even the operating profit at around Rs.80 crore was lower than consensus Bloomberg analysts estimate.

SpiceJet Ltd is the only aviation firm that performed better than expected. This is not to say that the airline was immune to pricing woes. But the impact on SpiceJet was less than expected, with its fares declining 3% year-on-year. In comparison, InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, which runs IndiGo, saw an 11% decline in average fare.
				   
				The SpiceJet stock had underperformed the benchmark Sensex since IndiGo announced results till 6 September. However, the trend changed on 7 September when SpiceJets results pleased investors, leading to a 16% jump in the stock that day.Jet Airways (India) Ltd had a bumpy landing in the June quarter. Jet said in its conference call that its drop in domestic average fare was close to 10% whereas on the global front the drop in average fare was to the tune of 2.5%. Factoring in higher-than-expected drop in yields and inching up in cost, Edelweiss Securities Ltd revised down Jets FY17/FY18 earnings per share (EPS) 25%/14%, respectively. Kotak Institutional Equities cut its IndiGo FY17-9 EPS estimates by 11-25% to account for near-term pressure on margins due to declining yield.On the revenue front, SpiceJets performance was the best, with revenue increasing 37% year-on-year, led by a combination of increase in capacity, robust load factor and 64% growth in ancillary revenue. IndiGos revenue rose 9%, driven by a combination of higher volume and a decline in average fares. Jets stand-alone revenue performance was the most disappointing with revenue declining 2% compared with last year. Jets domestic segment revenue performance was more discouraging than its global segment. But the lower crude price environment supported profitability. SpiceJets Ebitdar rose 57% while that of IndiGo declined 3%. Jets Ebitdar rose 3.7% year-on-year. Ebitdar, an important profitability yardstick for aviation companies, is short for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and lease rentals.After outperforming the benchmark Sensex at the beginning of this fiscal, all the three shares have underperformed in recent months.

				ICICI Prudential, the countrys only listed insurer, said that its net premium income grew 2.9% from a year ago to Rs5,698 crore for the three months ended 31 December. This was aided by a 46.7% rise in first year premium to Rs1,780 crore.However, the companys management expenses for the December quarter increased by around 19.2% year-on-year to Rs754.61 crore primarily due to an increase in employees remuneration and a 34% jump in net commission paid. The company said in a release that the increase in commission expense is broadly in line with the product mix and increase in premium.The expenses increased mainly due to the increase in our new businesses. From a ratio angle The expenses are more or less in line with our topline growth, said Sandeep Batra, executive director, ICICI Prudential Life.The company also posted an investment loss of Rs665.19 crore in the December quarter compared to a net income of Rs1,656 crore a year ago. This was primarily due to losses incurred on investments made under linked life insurance policies (Rs837.1 crore) and linked pension policies. This is not really a loss but it is a part of the linked business whose net asset values (NAVs) keep fluctuating. The fluctuation essentially needs to be moved both at the topline which shows as part of the investment income as well as consequential changes in actuarial results relating to the linked business. The two will net off each other. So this is essentially the marked to market value of the equity movement on the linked side, Batra added.In the quarters ahead, ICICI Prudential will continue to focus on protection business as it believes that there still exists a significant need for protection in India, Batra said, adding that customers are still choosing the linked category of policies the most.At the end of December, the companys solvency ratio was at 294%, down from 306% at September end and 319% at the end of December 2015.

				Within this universe, mid-sized firms such as NCC Ltd, KNR Constructions Ltd and IRB Infrastructure Developers Ltd continued to fare better. Ashoka Buildcon Ltd, a strong player in roads and in power transmission contracts, disappointed due to slow execution. Otherwise, most firms revenue moved up in high double-digits from a year ago. This was due to a combination of higher construction revenue and toll collectionsa function of higher traffic movement.The June quarter saw fresh order inflows, taking the total order backlog to about 2.5-3 times the net sales of FY16. This implies strong revenue growth at least for the next eight quarters. Meanwhile, the operating margin across firms was in line with brokerage estimates for the June quarter. That is perhaps why the BSE Infra index has risen steadily since April.Of course, there are a few rotten apples in the basket of infra firms. Typically, these are firms that are saddled with stuck legacy projects and, therefore, reel under a huge debt burden and weak operating cash flows. Investors must steer clear of these, although the governments recent proposal to settle disputed projects where there is a hearing in the developers favour, set these stocks on fire. However, it may be many quarters before their balance sheets turn favourable enough to lure investors.For example, the one-time hot favourite on the bourse, IVRCL Ltd, which outperformed street expectations year after year for over a decade, is weighed down by interest costs that are about one-fourth of its net revenue. The June quarter revenue contracted from the year-ago period for some firms with legacy projects due to weak execution.But the quarters robust net profit traction among the mid-sized road construction firms has raised investor hopes for FY17.

1.0,"Tokyo:  Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs at least $100 billion more to finance countrys goals for clean energy even after his governments policies brought in record investment in wind and solar power stations.
				   
				Thats the conclusion of a report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, which found $10.5 billion flew into renewables in India for the fiscal year ended 31 March, almost 60% more than the $6.6 billion invested two years ago. It also said 7.3 gigawatts of clean-energy projects were built for the latest fiscal year, which is 71% higher than the previous period.The findings represent the broadest assessment yet of the money going into Indias clean-energy industry. Growth in the renewables business has helped India become the third-biggest power market in the world after China and the US, according to the BNEF report. Modi has set a goal of building 175 gigawatts of clean-energy capacity by 2022 to supply more of the 62 million households that lack access to reliable grids and feed demand for electricity thats projected to rise fourfold by 2040.Hes taking the right steps, but the targets are quite ambitious, said Shantanu Jaiswal, the lead author of the report at BNEF. The question is where do people get the money$100 billion is a lot of money for this industry, especially given where were starting from.An investment of $100 billion is equivalent to almost 5% of all the goods and services produced annually by the nation of 1.3 billion people, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Diversified financingThe report, sponsored by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, a US non-profit working to mitigate climate change with renewable energy, was released at BNEFs conference in Shanghai on Tuesday. It also found that India has installed clean-energy capacity of 42.6 gigawatts. That accounts for 14% of the nations total generation capacity, up from 12.5% three years ago.Jaiswal said the nation needs to diversify its sources of finances to reach the goal, bringing in big international banks to complement the lending done by Indias state-backed institutions and the development banks active in the country. It also needs to reduce the cost of debt financing for solar projects, which is more than double the rate charged in China and six times interest rates available in Japan, according to the report.State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank, along with Axis Bank Ltd and Yes Bank Ltd, have helped supply much of the finance along with non-bank lenders such as Tata Cleantech Capital Ltd and L&T Finance Ltd. Development institutions include the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency, the World Banks International Finance Corp., the Asian Development Bank and KFW of Germany.The huge capital needed to meet the targets, as well as the high cost of capital, mean that fundraising from the public markets will be critically important, according to the report. Along with green bonds, India is turning to infrastructure investment trusts, which are used to free up and recycle developers capital stuck in operational projects by securitizing the revenue streams and offering the units on the public market.The arrangement, expected to help the inflow of foreign capital and reduce the exposure of domestic financial institutions, was approved in September 2014 by the Securities and Exchange Board of India. Infrastructure investment trusts are similar to yieldcos in helping developers combine multiple projects.To create safeguards for investors in infrastructure investment trusts, regulators have set a requirement for a minimum number of independent directors in the investment management firm and have also placed restrictions on transactions done between related parties, according to the report.India also needs to improve on the management of power distribution companies, according to BNEFs Jaiswal.Right now, Indias power distribution utilities are in huge debts, so they dont buy power even when theres demand, Jaiswal said.Retailers held total debt of almost Rs.4.1 trillion ($60 billion) at the end of March 2015, Power Minister Piyush Goyal said in August. That leaves the countrys power plants running below capacity, while one in five people go without electricity.

				The 11% drop in profit for  PNB was largely expected by most analysts and some had even expected a loss in the second quarter. So was the muted growth in advances, and a fall in net interest income.The state-owned banks historic loss of Rs5,370 crore in the March quarter was on the back of a phenomenal rise in bad loans and provisions for the same. The quarters that followed havent been merciful. In the September quarter too, gross non-performing assets continued to stay above 13% and the stressed asset ratio remained a massive 18%.Write-downs have escalated indicating that the lenders war room in bad loans is not getting much luck in resolution.But there is a silver lining, in fact several of them.Firstly, the banks fresh slippages have reduced to Rs5,089 crore in the September quarter from Rs7,533 crore in the previous quarter. Its cash recoveries have risen and so have upgrades. PNB has consciously shrunk its exposure to large companies, especially infrastructure. All this shows the banks war-room executives have not been twiddling their thumbs.But much of this is perhaps factored in by the increase in the banks stock price over the last three months. Since the announcement of its June quarter results, shares of PNB have gained about 6%, a lot of it helped by beaten down valuations compared with peers such as State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda.

-0.44,"Bengaluru: Back in 2008, 25-year-old Rohan Murty embarked on an unusual road trip. He travelled to various US cities around the Washington, DC metro area on his own, often walking for miles from one city to another. It was far from a thrill-seeking adventurehe was a man on a mission. Murty drove more than a thousand miles through forests and in the middle of nowhere.
				   
				Using a technology system he had built at Harvard Universitywhere he was at the time pursuing his PhD in computer scienceMurty was attempting to measure the actual usage of licensed and unlicensed spectrumwhich is typically used by telecom companies, TV and radio stations, as well as for technology such as Wi-Fi. He stopped every few miles, in order to validate the correctness of his research and the software he had built. What he found out during that study would lay the basis for his research into technology that is referred to as White Space Network or White-Fi. In laymans terms, White-Fi refers to unutilized television broadcast frequencies or white spaces that are potentially capable of delivering low-cost Internet connectivity to rural and remote parts of a country. What I found out during that trip was that spectrum in general is severely underutilized, says Murty. Murty jokingly recalls that at one point, he was even stopped by a state police officer, who wondered why some scrawny, brown kid was walking around suspiciously with an unusual technical device on a US highway. A vocal proponent of White-Fiwhich he believes has the potential to deliver affordable Internet connectivity to hundreds of millions of Indians across the remotest parts of the countryMurty is of the view that the Indian government needs to make a stronger push for White-Fi and does not agree with the current stand of top telcos such as Airtel and Vodafone, which have so far opposed the use of white spaces. Companies like Microsoft have also in recent months urged the government to fight for White-Fi and oppose the telecom lobby, citing the examples of countries like the US and UK where unlicensed spectrum usage has been permitted. In an interview, Murty, son of Infosys Ltd founder N.R. Narayana Murthy and a junior fellow at the Society of Fellows at Harvard University, spoke primarily on his research on White-Fi, how his work focused on architecture for dynamic spectrum access in wireless networks and other work that he is doing on the sidelines. Aside from helping manage investments for the Murthy family office, Catamaran Ventures, he has also made some angel investments under the radarincluding a small investment in Bengaluru-based start-up Floh, which is a singles network that helps urban and educated singles find life partners. Edited excerpts:What do you make of current debates around spectrum usage in India? The telcos have so far fiercely opposed the use of white spaces and unlicensed spectrum...Let me zoom back a little. Historically weve always thought of spectrum as a binary sort of thingeither somebody has exclusive access to it or nobody has exclusive access to it. So, its either licensed or unlicensed. Example of licensed, is TV, radio, cellphone companies, etc. Wi-Fi is an example of unlicensed spectrum, its the technology that Wi-Fi operates overthats one example. Wi-Fi is just a piece of technology though, not a piece of spectrum. Now, lets take an examplelets say you have a wire between your computer and the Internet. And you pump data through. Think of the wire as a pipe and data as water. The more volume of water you pump, the more data you are pumping through. But there is a limit before the pipe explodes, in some sense. So, what do you do when the pipe saturates? All you have to do is instal one more pipeor in this case, one more wire. So, in some sense you can have infinite bandwidthbecause you just keep installing more wires. And that works. But when you move to the wireless world, this is not the right analogy. The wireless world is like a highwaythe width is fixed, you cant increase the width at all. That is a limitation of nature. So, the capacity of a wireless world is boundthere is a maximum you can extract out of it. So, now you have these lanes on the highwaywhen you licence some part of the spectrum to someone, you basically say hey, this lane is yours. Nobody else can touch it. And then there is another lane which is for the public and they use Wi-Fi for it. Now, what happens is that more and more cars are getting into this lane and there is only one lane. And we start saturating this lane. What do we do? We look across at the licensed lane, which is registered to someone and we see that nobody is using it frequently and its just sitting there. But the law states that you can only use this one lane. And all this while more and more cars are coming and we feel there is scarcity. But the truth is that this is artificial scarcity. So, the work I ended up doing was to see if those unused lanes could be used without interfering with someone elses licensed lane and on how to detect the presence of others in that lane. When I detect youre coming, then I just get out and go back in the other lane. India seems to be lagging countries such as the US and the UK in terms of embracing the opportunity hereAbsolutely. India is behind in terms of thinking of new forms of spectrum usage. I do believe that is the case. If you go talk to the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) in the US and Ofcom in the UK, just look at some of the progressive things these guys are doing. In India, weve seen companies like Google and Facebook attempt moon shots with permission from the government and provide Internet access through balloon projects such as Loon to remote parts of the country. But weve surprisingly seen opposition on White-Fi. What does the government and the telecom lobby need to do on this matter? Is there a general lack of understanding of how this technology can benefit the masses? There is no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem. I dont think the answer is that telcos will solve everything. If they claim that, I dont agree with that. I dont think balloons will solve everything either. All these different technologies will play a role and theyll fit different needs. I think it will fulfil an important need. You cannot solve everything (with just White-Fi) as well. Lets assume that spectrum operated by Wi-Fi was operated by a telcoalmost certainly it wouldnt have taken off. Every time you would have turned your Wi-Fi modem on, you would pay the telco money. Today you dont pay anybody anything. So, I dont agree with the view that telcos will solve every problem. What is the potential of White-Fi in terms of connecting millions to affordable Internet? If spectrum is a good owned by the people, then the right thing is you want to raise revenue from it and at the same time want to maximize the usage of spectrum. Lets assume that you raise revenue from it and the spectrum is actually not being used. Then you have a losing proposition... I dont know if (White-Fi) can solve all (connectivity) problems, but it can certainly have a positive impact and become one of the many technologies that helps. And fundamentally, in my mind, it alters the way we think about spectrum. These are important policy decisions which will alter peoples lives down the line. I do admire the US on thistheyve been much more open-minded on this. I think there is a case to be made here as well. I think it is inevitable that there will be an increasing wave of opportunism in terms of spectrum use. Its like what Andy Grove said once: if you have a great piece of technology, you can send lawyers and bureaucrats to delay it. Ultimately the technology goes around it. Can you talk about some of your work in this area? Aside from my thesis on this subject, I even have a follow-on paper that was published. Its all there in my thesisits called SATYA, which was an algorithm, a system that we built with one of my professors at Harvard, where we showed that even on top of this, you can actually raise revenues. We showed how it lowers the barrier for access to spectrum, while also increasing overall revenues. This will be an inevitable part of our futureand thats what my work shows, what are some of these challenges and how do we overcome them. And how it will fundamentally alter our view on how spectrum is used.So, what are some of the challenges facing India?In this country and every country, our issue is about how do you connect more and more people to the Internet. There are a couple of different ways in which it can happen. One, you assume there is a fibre to every home. But we both know thats prohibitively expensive to build and to maintain. Its not easy. Second, everything will be through wireless, such as 4G. I think thatll work to a certain extent, but as we have seen in other countries such as the UK and the US, if you try to wire up large portions of the country where you dont have purchasing power, then the economic argument is not justified. In my mind, Ive always felt there is some other way to connect these people. I think there is room to wire up large parts of the country with some sort of semi-unlicensed spectrum. So, are we talking about the need for a wide-scale policy overhaul in India on this matter?Absolutely. Separately, how do you view Reliance Jios entry and the current price wars that are brewing between telcos?Im a fan of anything where the consumer wins. If I can get 4G everywhere at a reasonable price, Im happy.",2016-12-10,MZp7mAMVUiI5Nm8jZaqvwK,"The founder of Murty Classical Library on his research on White-Fi, or white space network, and the focus on architecture for dynamic spectrum access in wireless networks",both,01:48,Spectrum in general is underutilized: Rohan Murty

-0.79,"City gas distribution company Indraprastha Gas Ltd (IGL) delivered a good March quarter, primarily aided by higher volume. Higher margins helped, too. Compressed natural gas (CNG) volume increased 8% from a year earlier and piped natural gas (PNG) volume grew 9%. The company derives about three-fourths of its volume from the CNG business. Unfortunately, a decline in price realization for both segments meant IGLs revenue for the quarter fell 3.4% to Rs.882 crore.
				   
				However, a decline in raw material costs led to a 300 basis points (bps) expansion in operating profit margin to 22%. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The current quarter saw IGL gross spreads at Rs.9.6 per standard cu. m (scm), up 10% from a year ago and 4% higher than estimates and well above the average gross spreads of Rs.9.1 earned over FY14-H1FY16, wrote analysts from IDFC Securities Ltd in their post-result note. A strong operating profit performance and a slower rate of increase in depreciation costs helped net profit growth of 12% to Rs.108 crore.Analysts expect profit margins to improve. We expect some margin improvement from 1QFY17 onwards due to a lower CNG price cut announced by IGL post the 20% domestic gas price cut since April, pointed out analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd.More crucial would be volume growth. Even though IGLs total volume for the March quarter increased 8.4%, for financial year 2016, volume grew at a relatively slower pace of 4.4%. But the outlook seems brighter. We believe FY17/18E growth will see a much improved demand trend of ~8% versus the average of just 3% seen over FY14-16, says IDFC Securities. IGL, in particular, would benefit from the additions to Delhis state transport fleet, continuation of the odd-even scheme and the steady rate of addition of PNG connections (~100,000 households p.a.), added the brokerage.Nonetheless, its worth noting that IGL shares have outperformed. The stock has gained 7% in 2016, compared with a 2.4% decline in the benchmark Sensex. Currently, the stock trades at about 15 times estimated earnings for the current fiscal.

-1.0,"San Francisco: NetSuite Inc. shareholders endorsed Oracle Corp.s bid for the software provider, clearing the path for the $9 billion acquisition after weeks of conflict between a large investor and executives over the price tag.
				   
				The deal received approval from 53%, or 21.78 million shares, of NetSuite stockholders that were eligible to endorse the bid, Oracle said on Saturday in a statement. The approval comes after T. Rowe Price, which recently held about 18% of the stock, publicly pushed back against the offer of $109 per share, saying $133 would be a fairer price. An Oracle executive had said the offer was final. The decision came from shareholders other than Oracle chairman Larry Ellison and related parties who hold about 45% of NetSuite, along with executive officers and directors.Oracle is counting on NetSuite to help the companys shift to cloud-based services and better compete with rivals such as Salesforce.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. NetSuite is one of the largest pure providers of these modern software features, having carved out a leadership position in the market for tools that manage customers core financials.The deal is set to be completed on Monday, Oracle said. The tendered shares do not include more than 1 million separate shares tendered pursuant to the guaranteed delivery procedures set forth in the offer to purchase, the company said.Crucial timingNetSuite had come under pressure amid the uncertainty with the acquisition, Jack Andrews, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, said in a note late last month. Indeed, sales rose 26% in the third quarter, falling short of estimates. It also was a slowdown from recent quarters when revenue expanded more than 30%.For Oracle, the deal came at a crucial time. The shift to the cloud is a key part of its growth plan, as more customers demand software delivered over networks instead of installing programs on their own servers. While cloud revenue in the fiscal first quarter rose 59%, the companys total sales declined 1.7%, falling short of estimates.The agreement, first unveiled in July, was expected to be accretive to earnings. It wasnt a typical acquisition process, given Ellisons holdings in NetSuite. He was an early investor in the company.Following the July announcement of a deal, the stock traded around the offer price of $109 for several weeks. That continued even after investors learned T. Rowe wasnt happy with the price in early September. Later that month, Safra Catz, Oracles co-chief executive officer, said the $109 offer was the right price.Stock diveThe stock dived on 7 October by the most since June after Oracle said the deal had only received about 22% of the needed vote from unaffiliated shares, and the company extended its tender offer to Friday.Investors grew more nervous in the following days, and in late October, Mark Hurd, Oracle co-chief executive officer, said it was the best and final offer. He also said the company was willing to walk away and move on to other things. Within a couple of days, T. Rowe sent Oracles board a letter saying it still didnt plan to tender shares and wanted the higher price.Part of the reason we decided to send a letter on yesterday was to let not only Oracle, but also the marketplace, know that Look, we believe there is a price that makes sense, its just higher than $109, Robert Sharps, vice-president at T. Rowe, said in an interview then.The price of NetSuite stock fell to less than $90 earlier this week, before rebounding to close at $90.34 on Friday.

-0.25,"Bengaluru: Wipro Ltd, which launched its artificial intelligence (AI) platform Holmes 18 months ago, is now making its biggest push to embrace automation by allowing more of its managers to identify work which will not require engineers in each of the over 20,000 projects currently underway.
				   
				This bold development, according to one executive who did not want to be identified will mean Wipro doesnt just save on costs (thereby arresting falling profitability), but fundamentally alters the traditional model of deploying armies of engineers to undertake maintenance work.To be sure, that could also mean that its current workforce needs to learn new technology skills swiftly to stay relevant.Wipro is in the process of appointing individual leaders in each of the six industry-serving segments (which the company calls strategic business units) and five solution offering verticals or practices, who will be entrusted with the job of automating mundane maintenance work.Until now, Wipros chief technology officer K.R. Sanjiv, in consultation with various segment heads used to decide which projects could use Holmes. Wipros two larger rivals, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd, too have a similar centralized division that oversees the adoption of their respective intelligent automation platforms, Ignio and Mana. This explains why these companies, which employ hundreds of thousands of engineers, have embraced automation only in tiny pockets.At Wipro, this will now change. We announced internally in this quarter that we will have a more federated structure than running it from a central unit, which will further increase the pace (of adoption), Abidali Neemuchwala, chief executive officer of Wipro said last month.Hyper-automation is one of the central pillars of Neemuchwalas vision of making Wipro a $15 billion firm by 2020 with an operating margin of 23%. Wipro ended the year to March with $7.35 billion in revenue and 20.5% profitability. Wipro is consolidating all its automation assets and capabilities under the Holmes brand and significantly increasing its investment in hyper-automation. Going forward, every strategic business unit, service line and delivery unit will have dedicated leaders for Holmes, said a spokesperson for Wipro. They will be responsible for adoption of the existing capability and ideation of new use cases.In the first six months of the current financial year, Wipro claims to have freed and redeployed over 4,300 employees in newer areas of work, on account of automation. The managements decision to decentralize decision-making means Wipro could look to automate work of close to 10,000 engineers by the end of the financial year, according to a second executive who spoke on condition of anonymity.We are well ahead of our plan for the financial year. (But) we will not be able to provide information beyond what has so far been disclosed publicly, said the spokesperson.Experts are encouraged by the managements decision.Aligned with a market maturation around the broad notion of Intelligent Automation, Wipro is changing gears in the way it is engaging with stakeholders, said Thomas Reuner, the managing director at IT outsourcing advisory, HfS Research.Each of these Holmes leaders will be evaluated on the work they can automate. All of them will have individual targets, said the second executive. Until now, much of the work (that has been automated) is what is maintenance or L0 type. Hopefully, as we push automation, more L1 or L2 (higher order) work in areas such as application development or even software writing can be automated.Wipros aggressive push towards embracing automation comes at a time when automation platforms and cloud computing are threatening to erase the labour arbitrage enjoyed by Indian IT vendors.Still, Wipro, which has focused on demonstrating robust delivery and learning the lessons from the early deployments of its AI platform, will now, much like its peers, demonstrate that it can manage the transition from labour arbitration to automation in profitable manner, said Reuner.",2016-11-02,MfyyMa0zsQOTnJQGmZqHqK,Wipro is appointing individual leaders in each of the six industry-serving segments and five solution-offering verticals to reduce mundane maintenance work,competitor,04:35,Wipro in biggest automation push since launch of Holmes AI platform
1.0,"New Delhi: With its eyes set on doubling Indias present installed wind power by 2022, the ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE) has revised guidelines for onshore wind power projects. 
				   
				At present (till end-September), India has 28.1 giga watt (GW) of wind power installed capacity across the country and the Central government has set an ambitious target of generating 60GW by 2022. To achieve that target, MNRE believes that the current rate of deployment of wind power capacity is required to be more than doubled. The guidelines were revised to address new-age problems and reduce delays.India first came out with guidelines for development of onshore wind power projects in 1995 to ensure proper growth of the wind power sector. The guidelines were then revised in 1996. Since then, this is the first major revision.The guidelines aim to facilitate development of wind power projects in an efficient, cost effective and environmentally benign manner. They address all major issues like land use permission, availability of wind resource, grid connectivity, transport logistics, environmental acceptability, micrositing, health and safety, hybridization, repowering and decommission plan.The project developer should ensure that the land being selected for the wind power project can be legally used for the purpose and all regulations regarding land use/land cover are complied with, said the guidelines which were issued on 22 October. They clarified that in case of land allotment by the state government for the wind power project, a maximum period of four years may be allowed for development and start of commissioning of the project. But if there is a delay, then the land allotment may be cancelled.To address the issue of grid connectivity, the guidelines said that the project developer should ensure that grid connectivity is technically and commercially feasible at the site selected.If the site being selected falls in the area of forest land or in the vicinity of habitat of migratory birds and their flight routes, civil aviation, defence and heritage establishments the project developer should ensure availability of necessary clearances from concerning authorities, they added.It added that to ensure health and safety of people working/residing near the wind power installations the NIWE (National Institute of Wind Energy) will prescribe criteria for noise and shadow flicker in consultation with stakeholders.The guidelines also stated that a proposal to establish wind power project should necessarily include a decommissioning plan of the wind turbine after completion of its useful life.The NIWE will formulate guidelines for decommissioning of the wind turbines in consultation with stakeholders, it added.As per the MNRE, the need for such guidelines were felt because of advancement in the wind turbine technology, requirement to comply various standards and regulations issued by CEA (Central Electricity Authority) and other regulatory bodies, to address issues related to micrositing, decommissioning, health and safety.For instance, over the past 20 years, the wind turbine technology in India has evolved from less efficient turbines with low capacity of 225 KW to more efficient turbines with high capacity of 3 mega watt being manufactured in India.Indias total installed renewable capacity currently is around 44.2GW and significance of wind power in India can be assumed from the fact it amounts to over 60% of the total installed renewable power.

-0.52,"Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd is the bright spot in the Adani Group. Its earnings are growing consistently and the company is outperforming the sector on cargo volumes and expects to do well in the rest of the fiscal year.
				   
				Compared to 4% growth in the industry, Adani Ports clocked 7% rise in volumes in the June quarter. Helped by market share gains and addition of new ports and facilities, the company expects volumes to rise 10-15% in the current fiscal year. Last fiscal year, it grew 5%. Comparatively, volumes at its peer Gujarat Pipavav Port Ltd fell in the June quarter and analysts at best expect the firm to report flat or low-single-digit volume growth for the full fiscal year.Still, Adani Ports valuations are at a discount to Gujarat Pipavav, whose performance and outlook is nothing much to talk about. Adani Ports price-to-earnings multiple is at around 15 times the current fiscal year earnings per share estimate, while Gujarat Pipavav is trading at about 28 times. Even on enterprise value to Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization), Gujarat Pipavav is valued better, shows data compiled by Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd.Gujarat Pipavav is seen to be a relatively developed asset. Adani Ports is still in expansion modeboth through organic and inorganic routes. But that does not fully explain the valuations discount. The reason for this is related-party transactions and the perception that promoters are leveraging Adani Ports to fuel the growth of the group.Despite generating Rs2,867 crore of profit in fiscal year 2016, the companys borrowings (long term+short term) went up by a fourth during FY16. And a significant part of this borrowed money was loaned to third parties. From a meagre Rs68 crore in March 2015, loans rose to Rs2,922 crore in March 2016.Not surprisingly, the development earned the ire of investors, who sent the stock lower after the March quarter results. Recognizing the damage, Adani Ports began taking corrective measures. In a June quarter results call with analysts, the management said that it plans to reduce loans by Rs1,000 crore by the September quarter (Q2)-end and wipe them out completely by the end of the current fiscal year.While the comments helped the stock recover after the June quarter results, the quantum of loan reduction and commentary on future plans at the September quarter results announcement will determine the rerating potential of the stock. It should be noted that the stock, even after the recent recovery, is still lower than where it was a year ago.If Adani Ports delivers on the loan reduction promise, then the stock can rerate, say analysts. That will not only help it save on finance costs and conserve earnings but will also give investors the confidence that the companys financial strength is being put to the right usei.e., to grow its business and earnings.",2016-10-04,Mwr0x5tTCusdEZyb2O2DiI,"Helped by market share gains and addition of new ports and facilities, Adani Ports expects volumes to rise 10-15% in the current fiscal year",competitor,00:43,Will second quarter be a breakout one for Adani Ports?

Kotak Institutional Equities, for instance, was expecting constant currency revenue growth of 3.8%.Tech Mahindras Q3 profit up 14% to Rs856 croreThe growth is led by BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) and retail, transport and logistics verticals. Communications, which is still the single largest business vertical for Tech Mahindra, registered 1.7% sequential growth in revenue. In constant currency terms, the division is said to have grown by 3%.Where the company did not impress or exceed expectations is profitability. Despite the favourable baseQ2 has seen one-time restructuring expensesthe Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin expanded just 80 basis points to 15.7%. According to an analyst with a domestic broking firm, adjusting for the Q2 restructuring expense, the margin would drop 40 basis points. But then, as the analyst clarifies, margins can see volatility on a quarterly basis as the company integrates recent acquisitions. A basis point is 0.01%.Management commentary otherwise is encouraging. The management expects the enterprise business vertical to have outperformed the industry in the last quarter and it expects the momentum to continue. The company signed a large deal in the BFSI division and said its focus on a portfolio of services and geographical diversification is helping it overcome business volatility.In a conference call with analysts, the management alluded to a recovery in the troubled communications business, citing a large order win. The number of active clients has risen to 837 from 825 in Q2 and 801 in the year-ago quarter. Client additions were highest in the $1-10 million contract category.While the commentary should comfort investors who otherwise are worried about the overall slowdown in the IT (information technology) sector, profitability remains a weak link in Tech Mahindra. It is reducing costs through automation, which should aid profitability.The savings, however, can be undermined by wage hikes (scheduled in the next quarter, though a decision is yet to be taken). Also clouding the margin outlook is the change in political regime in the US and fear that the country will raise visa costs for IT employees. Britain is yet to emerge out of the European Union, the incidence of which can raise business uncertainty, as it is another key market for Tech Mahindra.While the issues affect the whole IT sector, the Tech Mahindra stock did relatively better than the BSE IT index in the last six months on growth recovery.

-0.91,"New Delhi: India may be a bright spot for global solar markets this year as it adds capacity at a record pace, becoming one of the top regions for panel producers struggling with rock-bottom prices.
				   
				India is expected to add nearly twice as much new solar as last year, outpacing once-booming Japan, according to forecasts by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF). China, the worlds largest renewables market, will see solar growth dip by about a fifth after peaking in 2016, London-based BNEF predicts.Bolstered by Prime Minister Narendra Modis ambitious clean-energy goals, Indias rising appetite for solar power spells good news for Chinese solar cell and module manufacturers including Trina Solar Ltd and Hanwha Q Cells Co. It comes after the global spot market price for solar panels fell to a record low amid slowing demand elsewhere.India pipped Japan to become the top importer of solar cells and modules from China for three out of 10 months last year and the trend will continue in 2017, according to Xiaoting Wang, a Hong Kong-based solar analyst at BNEF.India will account for 10 to 13% of global new build in the next couple of years, and its market fluctuation will have an important impact on the short-term supply-demand relationship and therefore the pricing environment, Wang said.India and Latin America are among key growth markets for solar panels, Trina Solar chief executive officer Gao Jifan said in an interview this week at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland.Also read: Investment Corp. of Dubai eyes India renewable energy investmentsThe worlds second-most populous nation is likely to add about 8.9 gigawatts of new solar in 2017, nearly twice the 4.5 gigawatts last year, according to BNEFs most conservative estimate. Japans new solar capacity may drop to about 6 gigawatts from 8.9 gigawatts in 2016, while China is estimated to fall to about 21.6 gigawatts from about 26.5 gigawatts last year.To be sure, Indias solar capacity is still small compared with China, the worlds largest solar market, and Japan. The South Asian nation has nearly nine gigawatts of solar installations, just a third of Japans 30.2 gigawatts and a little over a tenth of Chinas estimated 80 gigawatts at the end of 2016.While India races against time to meet Modis goal of installing 100 gigawatts of capacity by 2022, China scaled back its target by 27 percent to 105 gigawatts by 2020 under its 13th five-year plan amid stagnating electricity demand and a slowing economy.The five-year plan marks the beginning of a new era of reduced investment in renewables, BNEF said in its China Outlook for the second half of 2016, adding that it expects 2016 to be the near-term peak for new installed solar capacity in the worlds second-largest economy.Also read: Amplus plans acquisition of solar power firm Kiran EnergyAccording to BNEF chairman Michael Liebreich, one of the less welcome developments of 2016 was that wind and solar investment fell from their peaks in both China and Japan.This came as a major jolt to the sector, after many years of seemingly inexorable growth, Liebreich said in his yearly review for 2016.Japans solar installations for 2016 are estimated at 8.6 gigawatts to 9.2 gigawatts, lower than in 2015, according to BNEFs forecast. The drop comes as the country scales back generous incentive tariffs.China and Japan are now planning to adopt auctions. While India has conducted auctions since 2010 to build solar projects, Japan has promised to introduce the mechanism this year in a bid to lower the subsidies developers receive.Japans new solar installs peaked in 2015 when the country added 11.5 gigawatts of capacity, according to BNEF data.China, which has built most of its solar capacity under feed-in-tariffs, or government-set prices, is reducing these preferential tariffs and encouraging auctions to lower solar prices.

-1.0,"On Friday, Larsen and Toubro Ltds (L&Ts) stock hit a nine-month high of Rs.1,595, after outperforming the benchmark indices for the last couple of months.
				   
				Bloombergs consensus on the price-to-earnings multiple forecast for FY17 has risen several notches since April on the back of rising earnings estimates. But this is not alarming, given the host of positive developments in the company over the last few months.The management decision pencilled several quarters ago to gradually exit non-core businesses has started unfolding. Last week, it said that it plans to sell about 15% in its subsidiary, L&T Technology Services Ltd. This comes close on the heels of the success of L&T Infotech Ltds initial public offering, another unit where the parent sold about 10%.Indeed, these may be a drop in the ocean; considering the huge cash-flow requirement for its engineering and construction business, it has set the wheel of value-unlocking rolling.That is not all. The company intends to sell some operational road assets, power and ports, which are losing money.A Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd report dated 14th July, echoes the same sentiment, saying, these businesses together total losses of about Rs.1,000 crore, which, once sold, will add at least 2% to its return on equity.But then, selling loss-making businesses is not a cakewalk and could take time.There is a leap of faith on the Street. Investors seem to be buying into the management vision that cash flows from better operations and exit from non-core businesses should significantly reduce working capital from current levels. Note that net working capital had shot up from about 17% of sales to 24% in just three years, due to delays in project execution, customer payments, vendor support and so on. The economic revival should also alleviate these problems over the next 12-24 months.That said, there are concerns still on order inflows and margin trajectory. Order inflows for FY16 shocked the Street, declining 12% from a year ago, unable to meet the managements watered down forecast of flat order inflows. This fiscal, they are likely to grow by 15%. However, a report by Religare Capital Markets Ltd points out that order inflows are likely to be flat over FY15 levels, highlighting the plateauing of order inflows, given the high base and a weak investment cycle. Analysts are also apprehensive that a shift to Indian Accounting Standards norms can hurt margins.The macroeconomic clouds are clearing up, what with rising oil prices, a normal monsoon, along with the governments push on infrastructure. This should accelerate order inflows from the Middle East region, where L&T has a presence, and on home ground, albeit a few quarters later.Until then, a firm focus on executing its existing order book, which is about thrice the current revenue, will hold it in good stead. This is one reason why investors may choose to ignore near-term challenges on project execution and margin weakness. After all, it still remains the best equity play on infrastructure.",2016-07-18,NnFWaoNCbXOhaAqhxArq4I,"Investors seem to be buying into L&T management vision that cash flows from better operations and exit from non-core businesses should reduce working capital

				The report said that WhatsApp messages could be read without its billion-plus users knowing due to a security backdoor in the way the company has implemented its end-to-end encryption protocol. The system relies on unique security keys that are traded and verified between users to guarantee communications are secure and cannot be intercepted by a middleman, the report said.But WhatsApp can force the generation of new encryption keys for offline users unbeknown to the sender and recipient of the messages, it said.Tobias Boelter, a cryptography researcher at the University of California told the Guardian: If WhatsApp is asked by a government agency to disclose its messaging records, it can effectively grant access due to the change in keys.ALSO READ: Google drops dream of drones providing InternetBoelter said he had reported the backdoor vulnerability to Facebook in April 2016 and was told that Facebook was already aware of the issue but that it was not actively being worked on.

-0.54,"New Delhi: Sweating during frequent power cuts? You may soon be able to use natural gas-run air-conditioners at home.
				   
				Indraprastha Gas Ltd., an arm of state-owned gas utility Gail (India) Ltd will soon introduce air-conditioners running on gas in collaboration with a few New Zealand-based manufacturers in a bid to increase gas consumption in the country, managing director E.S. Ranganathan said.The gas utility, which has 6.5 lakh customers for piped gas in the national capital region and has a target of reaching 11 lakh in three years, is trying to create new markets for gas by diversifying into appliances running on the clean fuel. It has already started promoting gas-run power generators in institutions and residential complexes which replace costly and polluting diesel generation sets.The move is part of the oil ministrys plan to shift towards a gas-based economy in which the clean fuel will replace diesel and coal for power generation and petrol and diesel for transportation (by way of condensed natural gas or CNG). Government wants the share of gas in the hydrocarbon mix to go up from about 7% now to 25% in a few years.Our business development group is working on introducing air conditioners and geysers running on gas. This will be useful in areas such as Ghaziabad in the national capital region or Rewari in Haryana, where there are four hours of power cut, said Ranganathan.IGLs idea is to introduce a cost effective air conditioner, which will enable the consumer to recover the cost in a short time from savings on power consumption. There are some overseas manufacturers of gas engine air conditioners. We will tie up with those producers who can market it here and when it catches on, they can start manufacturing here, said Ranganathan.IGL has called a meeting of leading domestic and multinational producers of gas based power generators to draw up a financing scheme for consumers. More than IGL, it will be producers of gas-based appliances who will benefit from an evolving gas market, said Ranganathan. The cost of power from a diesel-run generator is about Rs19, while a gas based one could produce power for about Rs6-7 a unit.The average piped natural gas (PNG) consumption per household for cooking is about half a cubic meter a day, which translates to a monthly bill of about Rs360.With a target of adding 1.5 lakh customers every year, IGL is spending Rs300 crore this year and another Rs350 crore in the next to add more CNG stations and to lay more pipelines. The oil ministry has a target of raising PNG customers from 39 lakh now in the country to one crore in a few years.With gas consumption going up, IGL may have to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) to meet demand in the future. According to Kalpana Jain, senior director, Deloitte in India, at least in the foreseeable future, the country will remain dependent on imports for gas. For the moment, the going seems to be really good and all the projections seem to suggest that gas price is not going to go through the roof. Going by the investments flowing to construction of LNG import terminals and pipelines, there is a strong case for placing gas as a significant part in our clean energy portfolio, said Jain.",2016-10-13,NsSnxGSh9BcCmCHK3nZQzJ,"Indraprastha Gas , which has 6.5 lakh customers for piped gas in NCR, is trying to create new markets for gas by diversifying into appliances running on the clean fuel",both,19:15,Indraprastha Gas to introduce CNG-run air conditioners
0.17,"Shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd rose by around 2.5% in early trading on Wednesday on news that the Telecom Commissions new formula for spectrum usage charge will result in lower costs for some telcos. But by the end of the trading session, the shares gave up more than half of those gains, as it became clear that cost savings will be immaterial. 
				   
				Mint reported earlier this week that Bharti Airtels spectrum usage charge is expected to come down to 3.74% of gross revenue, from 4.9% currently. The cost savings would have been meaningful, although the commission also said that aggregate charges would have to match payments made by telcos in fiscal year 2015-16. In other words, there will be no near-term benefits from the move. From a policy perspective, however, the commissions decisions on spectrum usage charges are heartening. The government is known to eke out maximum revenues from the sector. By capping spectrum usage charges at FY16 levels and agreeing to a lower (3%) charge for future spectrum auctions, there appears to be a slight shift in its stance. Of course, this alone isnt enough to move the needle. Investors in the telecom sector will like to see similar forbearance when it comes to pricing of spectrum in the auctions. Earlier this year, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India recommended an auction of 700 megahertz (MHz) spectrum with a recommended reserve price of $8.5 billion for a 5MHz block. At the time, Kotak Institutional Equities said that bids for 700MHz spectrum would cause irreparable damage to the industry. A company such as Idea Cellular Ltd, for example, would need to pay $4 billion just for its eight leadership circles. This would increase its already high debt levels by over 70%. The government has shown no sign of toning down its expectations. In the budget for 2016-17, it has factored in receipts of Rs.55,000 crore from fresh sale of spectrum. In other words, it expects bids worth more than Rs.2 trillion in the coming auctions in order to receive an upfront payment of Rs.55,000 crore. In the March 2015 auction, telcos had paid around 26.5% of the total value of spectrum as upfront payment. In this backdrop, its clearly premature to read too much into the softening of the governments expectations on spectrum usage charges.",2016-06-09,O2Nd5SwQzirKfm8P9ZSjFO,"It is premature to read too much into the softening of the governments expectations on spectrum usage charges

-0.79,"Mumbai: When the Indian government invalidated high-value banknotes on the night of 8 November, taking out 86% of the currency in circulation by value, it was supposed to be a war on unaccounted-for and untaxed wealth, counterfeit notes and terror financing.
				   
				Somewhere along the way, as serpentine queues formed outside bank branches and automated teller machines (ATMs) for days and weeks together, the slogan changed. It became all about promoting a cashless or at least a less-cash culture in an economy where almost 90% of transactions are paid for in cash.The talk turned to technologies such as mobile wallets, crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin, mobile peer-to-peer payments, block chain technology, payment banks and architectures such as the unified payment interface (UPI) and the recently-launched Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) app.The total value of all transactions done using electronic payment systems in India in December rose to Rs105 trillion from Rs95 trillion in November, according to representative data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on 17 January. They included transactions done through the real time gross settlement (RTGS) system, the national electronic funds transfer (NEFT) system, immediate payment service (IMPS), credit cards, debit cards, UPI, point of sale (PoS) terminals and mobile banking.Indeed, the growing popularity and rapid adoption of digital payment systems, in the face of a shortage of cash and stringent limits on bank withdrawals, may be a silver lining to the demonetisation of Rs500 and Rs1,000 notesan exercise that some critics have slammed as ill-conceived and hastily implemented.To be sure, India has a long way go before it joins the ranks of countries such as Sweden, Finland, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, Singapore, France and the UK where more than 85% of the consumer payment transactions are done digitally.But its a start. Consider this. A day after demonetisation, Ola Money, the digital payment solution offered by ride-hailing company Ola, reported an over 1,500% increase in recharges across the 102 cities of its operation. Oxigen Services India Pvt. Ltd, too, claimed to have broken all its previous records in money uploads and transaction count in the week after the demonetisation.Similarly, the National Payments Corporation of Indiathe umbrella organization for all retail payments systems in Indiaclaimed that in just two days (8-9 November), the use of its domestic card schemeRuPayalmost doubled to around 800,000 transactions a day, compared with a daily average of 400,000 transactions earlier (http://bit.ly/2gdu0bW).One97 Communications Ltd-owned digital payments firm Paytm said on 21 November it had seen more than seven million transactions worth Rs120 crore on that day alone. The company claimed that offline, person-to-merchant transactions had grown to contribute over 65% of transactions. Mobile wallet FreeCharge, too, said it had ramped up its acquisition effort and was targeting signing up one million merchants in the coming 12 months.On 16 January, Paytm said it has received a phenomenal response for new service categories such as hospitals, tolls and petrol pumps, and expects to add more categories in the coming months. According to the company, the new categories are generating six million transactions a month and are expected to overtake mobile recharges (in terms of order volumes) by mid-2017. Over the next few months, Paytm will expand to newer categories such as automobile service stations, school and college hostel cafeterias, dairy outlets, apartment maintenance and traffic challans. The company will convert into a payments banks over the next two months, according to a 4 January Press Trust of India report.In a bid to give the country a digital boost, NPCI said its new electronic toll collection (ETC) system would eventually include other vehicle-related payments such as parking fees, servicing and fuel charges (http://bit.ly/2fIv7xf).It was only in September that NPCI launched a pilot project for Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS) with 26 Bharat Bill Payment Operating Units (BBPOUs). Most banks now offer UPI-enabled apps on Google Play Store. To use a UPI-enabled app, you need an Android smartphone, a bank account and a registered mobile number linked to your bank account (http://bit.ly/2eiNqw1).Digital transactions began booming after e-commerce firms such as Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon, Myntra and Jabong began offering attractive discounts to woo customers. Banks accelerated the efforts with their own mobile wallets, mobile banking apps, and pitches of banking on smartwatches and even social networking sites (http://bit.ly/1fucY4s).The launch of Pockets by ICICI Bank Ltd, Lime by Axis Bank Ltd, PayZapp by HDFC Bank Ltd, SBI Buddy by State Bank of India and Ziggit by IDFC Bank Ltd are cases in point.Large telecom services providers such as Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone India Pvt. Ltd, too, have mobile payments solutionsAirtel Money and Vodafone M-Pesa, respectivelytargeted at their own customer base, largely for mobile recharges and remittances. Idea Money from Idea Cellular Ltd, and Jio-Money by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd are other telco-led payment solutions. Airtel, meanwhile, has also announced the launch of its payments bank.Banking in India is witnessing what Nandan Nilekani calls the WhatsApp moment, threatening to disrupt the banking ecosystem in India as payments move to mobile and lending to algorithms. With the launch of UPI, the country has crossed a significant milestone.Apart from making payments easier, UPI enables micro-credit. This will help the currently underserved small traders and businesses. The visibility into transactions provided by UPI apps enables financial institutions to evaluate the credit worthiness of its users. Instead of assets, credit will be based on transaction flow, and can be issued instantaneously. This will provide more choice for borrowers, especially those who depend on moneylenders and the informal sector for loans, says Venkatesh Hariharan, director of Indian Software Products Industry Round Table (iSPIRT)a think tank.Smartphones and increasing Internet penetration will only help Indias digital cause. Around 90% of all devices will be Internet-enabled by 2017, and the number of Internet users will touch 650 million by 2020 from 300 million in 2015, predicts a 25 July report by Google and Boston Consulting Group (BCG). The report forecasts the size of the digital payments industry in India to touch $500 billion by 2020, contributing 15% to Indias gross domestic product (GDP). It also predicts that the non-cash (including cheques, demand drafts, net-banking, credit/debit cards, mobile wallets and UPI) contribution in the consumer payments segment will double to 40% in the same period.Further, while around 30 billion bills worth $103 billion are generated every year, of which 70% are paid in cash, initiatives such as NPCIs BBPS may give a further impetus to the digitization of bill payments.The number of mobile wallet users is already three times the number of credit cards issued in the country (24 million in 2015-16), according to the Google-BCG report.The smartphone explosion in India is expected to usher in this new era in digital payments over the next few years, according to the Google-BCG report.India currently ranks second in the world with more than one billion mobile subscriptions. Of this, around 240 million consumers use smartphones, and this base is projected to increase to over 520 million by 2020.Smartphone subscriptions in the country will increase fourfold to 810 million by 2021, according to the India edition of the Ericsson Mobility Report released on 7 June.The Google-BCG report also highlights that micro-transactions will form a substantial portion of the industry, with more than 50% of the person-to-merchant transactions expected to be under Rs100. It predicts that the value of remittances and money transfer that will pass through alternative digital payment instruments will double to 30% by 2020. A related BCG study (http://bit.ly/2bc0gLk) in August forecasts that by 2020, about 315 million Indians living in rural areas will be connected to the Internet, compared with 120 million now.Globally, too, the payments landscape is seeing heightened activity across multiple categories, ranging from device manufacturers (Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co.), tech firms (Google, eBay Inc., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd), retailers (Starbucks Corp., Wal-Mart Stores Inc.), telecom companies (Vodafone Group Plc., Orange SA) and start-ups (Square Inc., TransferWise Ltd), according to the Google-BCG report.More disruption is expected as the number of fintech start-ups doubled to 1,000 in approximately five years, with funding growing six times to reach $11 billion in 2015.This hockey-stick growth is due to the axis shifting to the customer, who is today served by a variety of competing business models and methods driving its adoption. The explosion in mobile banking is proof enough of how private banks and, later, PSU (public sector undertaking) banks, too, got their act together and worked with start-up fintech firms to rejig their apps, sites and in-house wallets to keep up with customer expectations, rather than trying and do everything by themselves, or waiting for the regulator to issue diktats, says Probir Roy, co-founder and director of digital payments firm Paymate.Hiccups clearly exist.Indians love their cash. Paper currency facilitates making transactions anonymous, helping conceal activities from the government in a way that might help agents avoid laws, regulations and taxes. This is a big difference from most forms of electronic money that, in principle, can be traced by the government, wrote Kenneth Rogoff, Thomas D. Cabot professor of public policy and professor of economics at Harvard University, in an 11 April 2014 paper.This trend is borne out by the fact that retail payments in India, for instance, are still dominated by cash, with a mere 6-7% of transactions conducted electronically. The rest are in cash or cheque.Uber is primarily a cashless service elsewhere in the world, but more than 50% of Uber trips in India are paid for in cash, according to a 10 November blog by Forrester Inc. analyst Ashutosh Sharma.Sharma points out that in India, merchants are forcing the choice of cash payments on customers because electronic payments eat into their marginsjust like everywhere else in the world.Barriers to a cashless world, concurs the World Economic Forum (WEF), include the fact that some merchants still dont want the infrastructure costs and fees associated with electronic payments; some customers still find cash more convenient; access is an issue for individuals without bank accounts; and fraudsters continue to find opportunities in electronic transactions.Consumers who have tried using digital payments but have now shifted to other modes such as cash, card and online banking say the inconvenience of remembering log-in credentials, insufficient acceptance, possibility of a technical or human mistake during a transaction and frequently running out of balance are the top reasons for lapsing, according to the report by Google and BCG. Hence, expanding merchant acceptance is critical to driving mass adoption by consumers.As of 30 September, the number of PoS devices which accept debit and credit cards as modes of payments at merchant outlets was a mere 1.49 million, according to the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBIs) monthly bulletin. Indians had nearly 730 million debit cards and 27 million credit cards at September end, though it isnt clear, however, how many people have more than one card (http://bit.ly/2gc6sFy). Moreover, most Indians use debit cards to withdraw cash from ATMs.According to Roy, a cashless economy has to have appeal and practicality at the most elementary level for consumers and merchants alike, especially given the plethora of overlapping and competing payment options.There are great apps for mobile banking, money transfer, shop and pay, tap and go, etc., and then there are the old faithful viz. net banking, prepaid cards, IMPS and e-wallets, USSD (unstructured supplementary service data) and UPI. The latter (USSD and UPI), yet to quite reach their WhatsApp moment, saddled as it is by the way banks have implemented, and promoting them vis-a-vis other offerings, lack of a people-friendly branding and a common user interface, explains Roy.Roy cites the example of a food court in a mall where you load your food court plastic card, redeem at food stalls on par and cash out the balance when done.Security is another big concern. According to cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab, while those who have been transacting online are fairly well-versed with the threats one can face while paying online, its the first-time users or new adaptors that need to be educated on the risks they are exposed to.According to Altaf Halde, managing director (South Asia), Kaspersky Lab, while payments through smartphones are very convenient and frees one of the pressures to hold cash, it calls for precautions. One small slip-up can cause one a huge loss. While companies are bound by law to follow guidelines, fraudsters find their way through many security barricades. The only way to safeguard oneself, in such a scenario, is to be vigilant while paying and to keep the mobile protected with a security plan. With these two simple steps, people can ward off almost all financial theft risks.

NPCI initially ordered ICICI Bank to rectify the situation. Later, in a U-turn, it said PhonePe is in violation of UPI norms (http://bit.ly/2iT5Q3F)On 4 January, CNBC-TV18 reported that SBI had blocked net-banking transactions with e-wallet firms, although it allowed customers to top up their mobile wallets with debit and credit cards.At the time, SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya said the service was blocked because of security concerns.Roy insists that an open-access platform allows for interoperability for wallets operators, and diverse choice for customers. This will allow banks to have a wider acceptability of popular third-party prepaid cards and wallets, with minimal loading failure rates.Second, it will enable them to, inter alia, inter-operate seamlessly and with minimal friction across a multi-sided base comprising e.wallets, banks and common merchants (same QR code for instance).Third, banks will have to rework service level agreements with their PoS merchants and card networks to ensure a much higher reliability.In conclusion, says Roy, India is too large a country, diverse in its perceptions, behaviours and idiosyncrasies to have a one-size-fits-all strategy for a post-cash world.",2017-01-27,ODcuu2wmWqGWNUY6wHhmmJ,The rapid adoption of digital payment systems is seen as a potential silver lining to the exercise that caused a widespread cash crunch thats only now beginning to ease,both,01:27,Indias cash conundrum: how ready is India to go cashless?
-0.23,"New Delhi: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has received the delivery of the worlds first very large ethane carrying ships that will be used for ferrying the fuel from the US.
				   
				Reliance had in 2014 ordered building of six Very Large Ethane Carriers (VLECs) at Samsung Heavy Industries Pvt. Ltd shipyards in Korea. The vessels are the first to feature new membrane technology from French specialist Gaztransport & Technigaz SA(GTT), considered key to the execution of the project.With a capacity of 87,000 cubic meters, the two vessels are the largest ethane carriers built to date.In a ceremony held in Geoje (South Korea), RIL inaugurated its very first two VLECs, GTT said in a statement.The two vessels, named Ethane Crystal and Ethane Emerald, are the first in a series of six VLECs ordered by RIL in 2014.Japans biggest shipping company Mitsui OSK Lines Pvt. Ltd will manage and operate the ships for RIL.Ethane, a natural gas component, is expected to be produced in large volumes in North America due to the shale gas revolution, which has generated an abundance of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Ethane is primarily used as a petrochemical feedstock to produce ethylene by steam cracking.RIL plans to ship 1.5 million tonnes a year of ethane from its US shale joint ventures to its chemical complex in Gujarat. The firm has two joint ventures (JVs) in Pennsylvanias Marcellus Shaleone with Chevron Corp., in which it has invested $1.7 billion, and another with Houston-based Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc., in which it has invested $392 million. It has a third JV, in which it invested $1.5 billion, in Texas Eagle Ford Shale group with Dallas-based Pioneer Natural Resources Co.The worlds richest energy billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led RILs business spans petrochemicals, exploration and production, retail and telecommunications. As per the original contract, Samsung was to deliver the ships to be used for ethane transportation, from October 2016 to January 2017. Each ship is priced at $120 million.VLECs are a hybrid of LNG and LPG carriers. Due to the expectation of competitively priced ethane as opposed to naphtha, a crude oil byproduct, petrochemical producers are hoping to lower their production costs by using ethane.The VLECs are to transport liquefied ethane from the US to the Dahej terminal in Gujarat, which will be used to supply feedstock for RILs crackers in Dahej, Hazira and Nagothane.RIL has an ethane supply contract in place with Enterprise Product Partners out of their Morgans Point terminal in the US Gulf, which exported its first ethane cargo in September on a 27,500 cubic meter vessel for Ineos.Earlier this week, RIL had stated that it has secured a $573 million of loan for part-financing of the vessel construction costs.",2016-10-28,OGRgM8F15eacBFWFH19ugP,"The two vessels, named Ethane Crystal and Ethane Emerald, are the first in a series of six Very Large Ethane Carriers ordered by RIL in 2014",both,20:22,RIL gets worlds first very large ethane-carrying ships

-0.14,"If you ever thought that Global Positioning System, or GPS, is the only technology used to develop navigation systems and give directions, you may want to think again.
				   
				A team of researchers at the University of California-Riverside (UCR) has developed a highly reliable and accurate navigation system that exploits existing environmental signals such as cellular and Wi-Fi rather than GPS.Most navigation systems in cars and portable electronics use the space-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), which includes the US system GPS, Russian system GLONASS, European system Galileo, and Chinese system BeiDou. For precision technologies such as aerospace and missiles, navigation systems typically combine GPS with a high-quality on-board Inertial Navigation System (INS), which delivers a high level of short-term accuracy but eventually drifts when it loses touch with external signals, the UCR researchers point out.However, GPS signals alone are very weak and unusable in certain environments like deep canyons. Second, GPS signals are susceptible to intentional and unintentional jamming and interference. Third, civilian GPS signals are unencrypted, unauthenticated, and specified in publicly available documents, making them spoofable, or prone to hacking, the researchers say. Hence, current trends in autonomous vehicle navigation systems rely not only on GPS/INS, but a suite of other sensor-based technologies such as cameras, lasers, and sonar. By adding more and more sensors, researchers are throwing everything but the kitchen sink to prepare autonomous vehicle navigation systems for the inevitable scenario that GPS signals become unavailable. We took a different approach, which is to exploit signals that are already out there in the environment, said Zak Kassas, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering in UCRs Bourns College of Engineering, in a 13 October statement. He led the team that presented its research (bit.ly/2dYsBUm) at the 2016 Institute of Navigation Global Navigation Satellite System Conference (ION GNSS+), in Portland, Oregon, last month.Instead of adding more internal sensors, Kassas and his team in UCRs Autonomous Systems Perception, Intelligence, and Navigation (ASPIN) Laboratory have been developing autonomous vehicles that could tap into the hundreds of signals around us at any point in time, like cellular, radio, television, Wi-Fi, and other satellite signals.In the research presented at the ION GNSS+ Conference, Kassas team showcased ongoing research that exploits these existing communications signals, called signals of opportunity (SOP) for navigation. The system can be used by itself, or, more likely, to supplement INS data in the event that GPS fails.The teams research approach includes theoretical analysis of SOPs in the environment, building specialized software-defined radios (SDRs) that will extract relevant timing and positioning information from SOPs, developing practical navigation algorithms, and finally testing the system on ground vehicles and unmanned drones.While GPS is a good outdoor location technology, it is unreliable indoors. However, the idea to supplement GPS with other technologies for indoor location use with widely-used location technologies including Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity), Li-FI (light fidelity), Beacons and NFC (near field communication) is not entirely new.Technologies like Beacons (such as Apple Inc.s iBeacon) are low-cost, low-powered transmitters equipped with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) that can be used to deliver proximity-based, context-aware messages. They are ideal for detecting smartphones indoors, where GPS isnt always effective, and can communicate with apps on devices when they are indoors. NFC requires users to pull out their phones and tap onto a NFC reader, thus requiring investments in tags, readers, etc. The range, however, is limited to 20cm and less. Beacons, on the other hand, typically have a wireless range of 1m to 70m but being radio transmitters, they too are susceptible to interference. Skyhook Wireless Inc. has a Wi-Fi-based location system, which it calls Wi-Fi Positioning System (WPS). Skyhooks patented Precision Location combines Wi-Fi with GPS, cell towers, IP (Internet protocol) address and device sensors to provide positioning for any device on any operating system (OS).Li-Fi is another option. Almost four years back, Harald Haas, who was then professor of mobile communications at the University of Edinburgh and the person who coined the term Li-Fi. and Gordon Povey, now chief executive at Trisent, claimed that Li-Fi broadband can replace GPS (bit.ly/2dbiQ6A).Haas, now co-founder and interim chief executive officer of pureLifia spin-out from the University of Edinburghbelieves that light fidelity (Li-Fi)-enabled LED light bulbs can also transmit data much faster than Wi-Fi (bit.ly/1Tn7rPM). According to a 2012 report in UK-based newspaper Independent (ind.pn/2e1Hoga), Li-Fi promised to challenge the dominance of GPS with Li-Fi LED bulbs so long as we are in the line of sight of the light source.",2016-10-26,OSfcc6xwRWg0Bd8pW6vAmM,Researchers at University of California-Riverside develop highly reliable and accurate navigation system that exploits existing environmental signals,competitor,00:10,"What happens when GPS fails?

-0.08,"New Delhi: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), operator of the worlds biggest oil-refining complex, has forayed into cooking gas retailing, launching a 4-kg LPG cylinder on pilot basis. Four-kg LPG cylinder launched in 4 districts on pilot basis, RIL said in an investor presentation on second-quarter earnings. 
				   
				LPG consumption is growing by over 10% and private refiners RIL and Essar Oil want a pie of it. Currently, public sector retailers Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum control retail LPG market, selling cooking gas in 5-kg, 14.2-kg and 19-kg cylinders. They sell 12 cylinders of 14.2-kg or 34 bottles of 5-kg per year to households on subsidized rates and any requirement above that on market price. The 19-kg cylinder is for commercial use. Private firms are not entitled for government subsidy and they have to sell fuel at market price. But with the government restricting volume of subsidy as well as barring consumers earning more than Rs10 lakh per annum from subsidised LPG, a ready-made market is now available for private oil companies. Mobile App rolled in all operating states to enhance customer experience, RIL said in the presentation. The company sells most of the LPG produced by its twin refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat to public sector retailers. While RIL did not disclose the price at which it is marketing the 4-kg cylinder, a 5-kg subsidized domestic LPG cylinder costs Rs58.50 in Delhi. A 5-kg cylinder for domestic use is priced at Rs181 while it costs Rs252.50 for non-domestic use. A subsidised 14.2-kg cylinder costs Rs427 in Delhi and a non-subsidized bottle comes for Rs490. A 19-kg cylinder is priced at Rs895. Domestic LPG consumption rose 10.8% in April-September this year to 10.2 million tonnes, nearly half of which was imported. The government had last year permitted RIL to sell up to 1.2 lakh tonnes of LPG produced at its plants to private cooking gas marketers. The LPG Control Order mandates that all cooking gas (LPG) produced locally must be supplied to state-run fuel retailing companies as India is deficient in LPG and has to import a part of the requirement. However, under the Parallel Marketing Scheme (PMS), private companies are allowed to import and market LPG to bulk consumers. Packed LPG business sales grew at 10% year-on-year basis, the company said in the presentation. On its aviation fuel business, RIL said ATF sales volume grew 31% in second quarter and it has leading market share at 10 out of 25 airports where it operates.",2016-10-23,OX12qQaqfnM0TGUNgXeDZN,"While RIL did not disclose the price at which it is marketing the four kg LPG cylinder, a five kg subsidized domestic cylinder costs Rs58.50 in Delhi",both,14:00,RIL introduces four kg LPG cylinder

				Apart from cash, Amazon India will allow customers to pay using credit and debit cards at the time of delivery of the order. As of 11 November, we are re-introducing CoD to enable options to pay at the time of delivery. This accommodates customers who face challenges of paying online, but are still able to use electronic instruments at delivery, an Amazon India spokesperson said. The spokesperson added that the delivery agents have been trained to help customers who opt for card payments at the time of order delivery or valid currency notes, including the newly introduced Rs500 and Rs2,000 notes. About digital payments on the platform, the spokesperson said electronic payments at doorstep have gone up by a factor of 10x in the past two days. This clearly indicates that customers are able to adapt to electronic payment methods when cash is constrained.

-0.25,"Ten days ago, L Catterton, the result of a merger between the private equity (PE) and real estate funds of LVMH Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessey SE, held its annual summit in New Delhi. L Capital, as the PE unit of LVMH used to be known, has invested in Fabindia, PVR and Genesis Luxury (it has exited from the first two). 
				   
				Ravi Thakran, managing partner and chairman of L Catterton Asia, known for his insightful understanding of the luxury and consumer goods markets of Asia, who was in the national capital for the summit, spoke to Mint about the urgent need to invest in Indian artisanal luxury. Thakrans belief that L Catterton could become a change agent in the arts and crafts sector given the right conditions may be a big idea whose time has come. He also argues why the Indian governments development agenda should include local luxury. How would you describe your experience of investing in and working with Indian companies? Any thoughts about the work culture here? I firmly believe that India has a long and credible history of entrepreneurship, which is manifest in many success stories across sectors. This story is only getting stronger, and it is encouraging to see new business ideas coming to fruition from first generation entrepreneurs, and a changing mindset within the old business families too. There have been various issues, such as policy certainty on the one hand, poor infrastructure on another and costly real estate, etc. that have been inhibitors to even higher growth. We are pleased at the progress being made by the current government in addressing some of these. Of course, we would all hope for faster progress on some of these fronts. Lastly, the one big issue impacting investments has been concerns around governance and transparency. Thankfully, the incidence is reducing, but as investors, one cant overemphasize the importance of entrepreneur selection. Has the merger of L Capital and L Catterton changed the companys essential parameters for choosing luxury, apparel or consumer brands to invest in? We have and will continue to be focused on the key consumer categories that appeal to the vast and growing middle class across Asia. Of course, with the combination, we benefit from a much longer experience base and wider global reach and insights. As Asia develops, some categories that were hitherto nascent in the Asian context, but relevant in North America, such as pet foods, health and fitness, etc., are now gaining traction. You have invested in Bateel dates in Dubai. There could be numerous such small potential parallels in the food business in India. Does anything particular from Kerala to Kashmir currently interest you?Given Indias vast and diverse food history, there clearly are a number of interesting food businesses that can be interesting globally. Some segments like Darjeeling tea are fairly obvious, but the key is to make the transition from a generic provenance to more distinctive branding. A related example that I could quote is the success that Fabindias subsidiary Organic India has had with commercialization of tulsi (a kind of basil ). Organic products and wellness products created from Ayurvedic or herbal ingredients are a part of Indias culture. Yet, no such brand has become a leading global name. What could be the reasons?I would not agree that India has had no success in this arena, with Himalaya being a very obvious example. Of course, if you look at the more premium segments of the global market, one would agree that no Indian business has been able to make a meaningful dent thus far. This is in part driven by the dynamics within the local market, in terms of price points, etc., which have an impact on how companies think about things like packaging, route to market and marketing, etc. But the more premium end of the market is now taking shape. Be it brands like Kama Ayurveda or Forest Essentials, these companies have clearly approached the opportunity differently and some of them will be able to evolve into brands that are relevant globally. Which is the most unusual and unexpected portfolio company L Catterton chose to work with anywhere in the world or in Asia? I am not sure if I would use the terminology unusual or unexpected, because as long-term, sector-focused investors, we only invest after a rigorous and detailed study of any investment. That being said, when we invested in PVR in India in 2012, it was our first investment in the media space, let alone the multiplex business. While not very obvious, we could clearly see that the company could benefit from our involvement, which as you can see from its success since, has clearly played out. Be it in helping the company grow inorganically, enhancing its digital interface and share of e-ticketing revenues, to increasing the contribution of non-ticket revenues, there have been multiple areas where we were able to contribute to their success. What do you think about luxury in India?India perhaps has the most evolved luxury products of the world. Whether they are from the glass industry of Firozabad or the perfumes of Kannaujwe should take pride in the diversity. There is a long list of Indian creations that symbolize cultural elegance as well as are a statement of worth and status without any logos. Wearing Indian luxury is the best way to say I am here to be myself, not to espouse a logo. That is the ultimate definition of luxury and the entire world is now moving towards embracing it. Take for instance, the white cotton dhoti with a gold border. It respects culture, is innovative, understated, has a name, is classic and yet can be so contemporary. While earlier many of these artisanal creations survived under the patronage of royalty, later due to various supply chain issues, the value of our craftsmen went down. We have the capacity to leapfrog but nobody is talking about building global luxury from India. The development agenda of the current government must make this a priority. India must wake up. I genuinely hope that luxury because of its labelling is not seen as elitist and kept aside. Look at how the Chinese build billion-dollar brands. We need to make that happen in India. Enriching craftsmen is a national responsibility.Did L Capital ever make an effort in the past to step in and create global brands out of Indian crafts and arts?We have been continuously exploring how to somehow provide the route or become the route to marketing this extraordinary luxury of India. In fact, a couple of years back, we tried to collaborate with a Kolkata designer who I would not like to name but someone who we believed could lead the project and curate products from 14-15 well known and significant weaving states of India and build them as a brand. Somehow it did not work out then.Will you revive that plan? Are you still looking for a design leader who can curate art and crafts brands for strategic brand building?Of course! This is my clarion call to anyone out there who deserves and commits to a curating leadership role. Craftsmen struggle to find platforms and at L Catterton we want to become that platform. We want to work with 10 chosen centres of excellence as one corporate body, become change agents, create a market route.",2016-10-29,OpJTGTg4VFbMukXENvPgyI,L Cattertons Ravi Thakran on why it is time to build global luxury from India and on the changes after the merger of L Capital and L Catterton,competitor,00:30,India needs to build billion-dollar brands: Ravi Thakran

Importantly, there will be a uniform licensing system which will cover all hydrocarbons, i.e. oil, gas, coal bed methane, etc., which should help companies explore all kinds of oil and gas resources under one licence.
				   
				The blocks under the new policy will be awarded through an open-acreage policy, which will enable E&P (exploration and production) companies choose the blocks from the designated area. Also, there is a shift to a revenue-sharing model, which will be easy to administer for the government. The measures announced are positive for the sector and are expected to simplify licensing rules and accordingly boost investments in the sector.Whats in it for investors?One of the key announcements made is allowing pricing and marketing freedom for natural gas produced from difficult terrain. This would be applicable to all discoveries in deep water/ultra-deep water/high temperature/high pressure areas which were yet to commence commercial production as on 1 January 2016 and for all future discoveries in such areas.However, there is a ceiling price, which means that prices will not be totally free. According to analysts, the ceiling price based on new guidelines, starting 1 April works out to $6-6.5 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). Domestic gas prices are at $3.82 per mmBtu currently. That looks attractive but its important to realize that the benefits from this development are not going to be visible in the near future.As Nitin Tiwari, an analyst at Antique Stock Broking Pvt. Ltd, says, the new pricing for production from difficult fields could be beneficial for Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) when its KG-DWN-98/2 starts production. Similarly, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) too could benefit when it starts production from its R-Cluster and satellite fields. However, production from the above mentioned fields may start by FY19 or beyond, which means benefits from the development are accordingly going to accrue in the longer-run, than in near term, points out Tiwari.Secondly, the state of the macro environment and commodity (crude/NG/FO) prices would also be crucial for above mentioned developments as policy itself is not a sufficient condition to facilitate investment, he adds. The government has also said that in case of pending arbitration or litigation pertaining to gas pricing covering such fields, the new rules will be applicable only on the conclusion/withdrawal of such litigation/arbitration. This does not augur well for RIL, which is currently in a legal battle with the government over gas pricing.

Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party in 2012, during which Xi was elected as its general secretary, and taking over as the president and military chief launched the anti-graft campaign which also attracted criticism that he used it effectively to consolidate his power emerging as the most powerful Chinese leader after party founder Mao Zedong. Over the years, China promoted anti-corruption laws, improved the supervision system, deepened judicial system reforms and adopted measures to make sure the system is transparent, it said without referring to criticism about the campaign. For instance, Chinas foreign ministry has lately published information about the families of 12 senior officials on its website in an effort to fight against corruption through familial networks by improving transparency.

				These look like extremely high valuations for Sistemas loss-making operations, and the deal will only make sense if R-Com can monetize the spectrum assets through a favourable arrangement with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. R-Com has paid three times Sistemas annual revenues of Rs.1,500 crore. This is much higher than Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltds enterprise value to sales valuation of around 2.2 times. While these companies have operating profit margins of over 30%, Sistema reported operating losses were well over 30% of its revenues. Even if R-Com extracts all synergies possible and improves Sistemas operating profit to 30%a far crythe valuation still looks unpalatable at 10 times, far higher than 6-7 times EV/Ebitda valuation of incumbents. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. But Sistema holds 800 mega Hertz (MHz) spectrum in eight key circles, which can be extremely valuable for Reliance Jio. It will help in launching its LTE services, including voice over LTE, with much wider coverage, vis-a-vis spectrum in higher frequency bands.Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients, We see this transaction as just a precursor to a much larger transaction involving R-Com and R-Jio. We note that there is very little circle overlap between the liberalized 800MHz spectrum holdings of R-Jio and MTS (Sistema). Of the 10 circles in which Reliance Jio has 800MHz spectrum, six are in so-called C-level circles, which are the least lucrative in terms of revenue potential. Sistema holds spectrum in lucrative circles such as Delhi, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kolkata. Based on the discovered prices in this years auction (and using the reserve price in circles where there werent any bids), Sistemas spectrum in these eight circles is worth Rs.7,955 crore. Not all of this will necessarily flow into R-Coms books, even if Reliance Jio agrees to the price. This is because the governments spectrum-trading guidelines includes a clause that states that for any spectrum acquired in the March 2013 auction (such as Sistemas), trading will be permitted only if the price differential vis-a-vis the latest auction price is paid. The spectrum was acquired for Rs.3,639 crore, which means a differential of Rs.4,316 crore will need to be paid before this spectrum can be traded. Sistema has challenged this clause in the courts, and if it wins, R-Com will make it an additional payment of $300 million (approximately Rs.2,000 crore), according to a Sistema spokesman. R-Coms statement states, An appropriate payment/earn-out mechanism has been agreed in relation to disputed spectrum contiguity charges claimed by DoT. On the other hand, if the department of telecoms claim is upheld, Sistema will bear no liability. In either case, R-Com can only hope to recoup these additional costs when it sells the spectrum eventually to Reliance-Jio. All told, much depends on the outcome of this case. More depends on how much Reliance Jio is willing to cough up for spectrum in these eight circles. Doubtless, it will seek to tweak its outgo depending on R-Coms effective cost. R-Com chairman Anil Ambanis comments at the companys annual meeting suggested that a deal with Reliance-Jio is imminent. R-Coms market capitalization has risen by Rs.4,400 crore since then. Its doubtful Reliance-Jio will leave so much on the table, especially considering the fact that its capex has already reached unusually high levels. Investors should tone down their expectations.

-0.05,"Moscow: The Russian governments sale of a controlling stake in mid-sized oil firm Bashneft to the countrys largest oil producer Rosneft should give momentum to Russias privatisation drive, president Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday.
				   
				The economy ministry said that the government had completed the sale of the Bashneft stake to Kremlin-owned Rosneft for 329.69 billion roubles ($5.30 billion).Rosneft bought a 50.08% stake in Bashneft, Russias fastest growing oil company with production of 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) and extensive refining assets, beating an offer from an unidentified second bidder.The sale is a key step in a government privatisation push meant to raise cash to plug budget holes amid low oil prices and Western sanctions imposed over Ukraine.The main thing is that we dont stop the privatisation process on this (Bashneft sale), Putin said at an economic forum.This privatization is carefully crafted, keeping in mind the synergy effect for obtaining the maximal gain from the point of view of budget and fiscal interests, he said.Putin said that now a 19.5% stake in Rosneft could be sold to private foreign investors.The Bashneft deal has caused tensions, with the government postponing the sale in August to calm rivalry among powerful groups before September parliamentary elections.Several Russian government officials including deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich had said previously they opposed plans by Rosneft chief executive Igor Sechin to expand further.One state-controlled company, Rosneft, buying another, Bashneft, could hardly be called a proper privatisation, they said.It may sound strange to you but I personally was surprised by this governments position myself, Putin said on Wednesday, referring to the decision to allow Rosneft to buy Bashneft.Putin said later on Wednesday that Rosneft used its own funds to buy the Bashneft stake, where 25% is owned by internal republic of Bashkortostan. It remains unclear if Rosneft will buy that stake later, too.Rosneft production stands at around 4.1 million bpd now and is expected to grow thanks to new fields coming onstream this year.According to a regulatory statement, Bashnefts board plans to vote on a new chief executive on Thursday. Alexander Korsik, who oversaw Bashnefts production spike, is expected to be replaced by Andrey Shishkin, a vice-president at Rosneft.A source familiar with the situation said the management board was also expected to be taken over by Rosneft managers. Bashneft declined comment.Sechin has said that the purchase of Bashneft would provide a synergy effect for the company. Rosneft is considering buying out part of the Rosneft stake set for privatisation itself, as one of the options.The state hopes to raise around 700 billion roubles from the Rosneft privatisation to plug holes in the budget.

Microsoft employs more than 1,13,000 people worldwide, more than 64,000 of whom are in the United States, mainly in Washington state, according to the company. In the wake of Trumps win, companies are eager to play up the number of Americans they employ, the CNNTech said.

0.65,"New Delhi: Power minister Piyush Goyal on Monday pitched for wider use of smart electricity meters and urged the electrical equipment industry to come up with innovations that suit the domestic consumer as the country strives to use energy efficiently.
				   
				Addressing industry executives at the beginning of a three-day conference organized by the Indian Electrical & Electronics Manufacturers Association (IEEMA), Goyal said smart meters, which are crucial for a roof-top solar power plant which is connected to the grid to sell surplus power, can be a game changer. Selling surplus power to the grid enables a roof top solar power plant owner to recover the cost of the plant.I am given to understand that in some smart meter tender for only 10,000 units, the quotations were of Rs3,000. Now if 10,000 meters can be bought or sold for Rs3,000, imagine the price that can be discovered at a scale of 25 crore smart meters. We have the example of LED bulbs, Goyal said. The governments efficient lighting programme has led to a decline in the public procurement price of LED bulbs sharply to just over Rs 50 apiece from more than Rs300 less than two years ago. Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd. is now installing 200,000 smart meters and is planning to scale it up to 1.5 million in five to six years, while Reliance Power Ltd-owned BSES Yamuna Power Ltd and BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd, which supply electricity in Delhi, are also installing smart meters for customers in phases. Smart meter can be a game changer when it comes to planning the electricity sector in the long run, said Goyal. The central government is prompting state-owned power distribution utilities to improve operational and billing efficiency under the Ujjwal Assurance Discom Yojna rolled out in November 2015. Our electrical industry should come up with indigenous innovation.

0.05,"Mumbai: Running a marathon is a metaphor for Natarajan Chandrasekarans career. 
				   
				Twice over.In Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), a business he will lead until 21 February, Chandra, as he is popularly known, has spent almost 30 years, his entire working life.He started as a software programmer with TCS in 1987 and rose through the ranks to become one of the youngest chief executive officers (CEOs) in Tata group when he was 46 years old in 2009.Now, as he prepares to take over as chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, Chandrasekaran is in effect getting ready to run another marathon.He is 53 and the retirement age for top Tata executives is 70, giving him a potential 17 years at the helm of the $103-billion group that has businesses ranging from salt to steel and tea to telecom.Running a marathon is also a metaphor for running a business, according to Chandrasekaran.You have to decide on the length of the engagement, develop endurance to handle setbacks and increase speed when the competition demands it, Chandrasekaran said in an interview to Runners World magazine in October 2015 (bit.ly/2iFOCtK).You have to perform with your heart and your mind; you will not get lost on the way if you have a good road map; you will get nowhere without discipline. This is what I always tell my employees in speeches, he said.He will start running his new marathon at a time when Tata group is in the midst of a bruising battle with its former chairman, Cyrus Mistry, who was sacked on 24 October in a boardroom putsch, less than four years after he succeeded family scion Ratan Tata.Also read: Tata vs Mistry: NCLT dismisses contempt of court plea filed by Mistry firmsThe feud between Mistry, who has accused the 149-year old business house of a variety of corporate governance violations, and Tata has reached the National Company Law Tribunal, or NCLT, where a long and messy legal battle is looming.The Mistry family is the largest minority shareholder in Tata Sons, the holding company of the group.We are at an inflection point, Chandrasekaran wrote in an emailed statement after his appointment. I am aware that this role comes with huge responsibilities. It will be my endeavour to help progress the group with the ethos, ethics and values that the Tata group has been built on.A Tata Sons spokesperson said the chairman-designate was not available for interviews immediately.Chandrasekaran, we believe will now inspire the entire Tata group to realize its potential acting as leaders in their respective businesses, always in keeping with our value system and ethics and adhering with the practices of the Tata group which have stood it in good stead, the Tata Sons board said in a statement on 12 January while announcing his elevation. The five-member selection committee chose him unanimously, it added.Also read: Tata Sons new chairman has twin obstaclesa family and a conglomerateChandrasekaran would be no stranger to the value systems and the practices that the board is talking about. The man who would have been a farmer joined the company after completing his Masters degree in computer applications from the Regional Engineering College in Trichy, Tamil Nadu. Over time, he has worked in a variety of positions (chief operating officer, executive assistant to S. Ramadorai, the previous CEO), and places (California and Stockholm). In that sense, he is an insider.He is an outsider because he is the first truly professional chairman of the Tata Sons board who is not related to the Tata family.Nowroji Saklatwala, the third chairman of the group, was the nephew of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of Tata group. Cyrus Mistry is the brother-in-law of Noel Tata, half brother of Ratan Tata.This can be interpreted in two ways: Either the Tatas chose a safe option by choosing an insider, or the group took a step forward to regain its tarnished credibility by choosing a non-family memberand one with a proven track recordto lead the firm.Also read: N. Chandrasekaran begins long road to restoring Tata groups imageIndeed, Chandrasekarans first task will be to restore the reputation of the group and the sheen of brand Tata.A day after his ouster, Mistry (in a letter that subsequently found its way into the public domain) said the Tata group was beset with a host of corporate governance issues.The group was staring at a potential $18-billion write-down, he claimed. It persisted with a loss-making project, the Nano small car, because it was an obsession with Ratan Tata; there was undue interference from some of the trustees of the Tata Trusts, which own two-thirds of Tata Sons; some friends and associates of Ratan Tata benefited from Tata group contractsthey all were a part of Mistrys lists of allegations.Subsequently, the listed companies of the Tata group lost 6.1% (till 16 January) of their market capitalization, and regulators began asking questions.The controversy at Tata group is not his (Chandrasekarans) creation. He just needs to ride it out. I think if he can build a reasonably supportive relationship with Cyrus, it will be good for the image of corporate India, said Ganesh Natarajan, vice-chairman at Zensar Technologies Ltd, who has worked with Chandrasekaran at software industry lobby Nasscom.Restoring the reputation is just a start. The fact remains that the Tata group has several underperformers. The so-called legacy hot spots which were named by MistryTata Power Co. Ltds Mundra plant in western Gujarat, Tata Steel Europe, Indian Hotels Co. Ltd, Tata Teleservices Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd passenger vehiclesall are pressure points.For instance, in the four years to fiscal 2016, Tata Steel has taken an impairment charge of at least Rs24,175 crore, most of it attributed to the European assets that it acquired with the 2007 purchase of Corus Group Plc for £6.7 billion (Rs54,000 crore today).In the past fiscal, losses at Coastal Gujarat Power Ltd (CGPL), which houses the Mundra plant, were Rs1,491.86 crore.Looking at data aggregated between 2011 and 2015 and limit the analysis largely to the legacy hot spots, it will show that the capital employed in those companies has risen from Rs1.32 trillion to Rs1.96 trillion A realistic assessment of the fair value of these businesses could potentially result in a write-down over time of Rs1.18 trillion, Mistry pointed out in his letter.But it wont be easy to rejuvenate these businesses. Selling or exiting them wont be a quick option since it will call into question the business wisdom and legacy of group patriarch Ratan Tata.Look at Tata Steel. Corus is a disaster, said T.V. Mohandas Pai, chairman of Manipal Global Education and former board of director at Infosys Ltd. Cyrus tried to change that by selling assets, but they ousted him as they said it was against Tata values, said Pai.Tata values, he said, cannot be based on destruction of shareholders value.Pai terms Chandrasekaran as a go getter who is great at marketing and building relationships, but he is not sure if he will get the much-needed free hand to run Tata Sons.Once he takes charge at Tata Sons, the key issue wont be whether he will be able to do well, but whether he will have operational freedom, he said.This talk of freedom to operate that Pai is talking about goes to the crux of Mistrys accusations.Mistry, in his 25 October letter, said he had been reduced to the position of a lame duck chairman.He accused Tata Trusts and some of the trusteesRatan Tata and Noshir Soonawala, in particularof excessive interference in the running of listed Tata companies.Documents filed by the Mistry family firmsCyrus Investments Pvt. Ltd and Sterling Investments Pvt. Ltdin NCLT alleged mismanagement of Tata Sons and oppression of minority shareholders, cited some examples and called them shadow directors.These charges have been strongly refuted by Tata and Soonawala in affidavits they filed in reply.Also read: Why Natarajan Chandrasekaran is a safe choice for Ratan TataLeaving this issue aside, Chandrasekaran will anyway have to establish a good working relationship with the principal shareholders of Tata Sons, both in terms of navigating the three-tier structure of the groupTata Trusts, Tata Sons and Tata group operating companiesand in meeting their expectations.Already, the trustees have come out with statements highlighting their concerns.The new leadership at Tata Sons should ensure that the overall profitability and income of the group improves, and the dividend payout by Tata Sons to Tata Trusts not only stabilizes but also increases, said V.R. Mehta, a trustee of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, in an interview, a day after Chandrasekarans elevation was announced.The main worry of the trust was the decline in the dividend income of Tata Sons from the operating companies, he said.In a 10 November statement, Tata Sons had pointed out that with the exception of TCS, all 40 other firms (many non-dividend paying) in its portfolio paid dividends that have continuously declined from Rs1,000 crore in 2012-13 to Rs780 crore in 2015-16.It said even the Rs780-crore figure included an interim dividend of Rs100 crore, which would have been normally received in 2016-17. Shriram Subramanian, managing director at InGovern Reearch, a proxy advisory firm, says while Chandrasekarans capabilities are beyond doubt, he needs to ensure that better corporate governance practices prevail in the group, and he is not seen as a yes man to Ratan Tata.Also read: Chandras true test will be shutting down Tatas loss-making businesses: Aswath DamodaranIn TCS at least, Chandrasekaran has proven to be his own man as can be seen from the 2008 reorganization of the software firm into five groups, whose directors began reporting directly to him.But the challenges will be different now, when it comes to dealing with other group CEOs, many of them his peers.To some extent, Chandra will also be constrained by not having the experience of having dealt with huge debt and with bankers, said Subramanian.TCS has been the cash cow of Tata group. It accounts for around 17.5% of the total revenue of the conglomerate. It is the company which spews cash to fund Tata ventures into newer businesses, allowing Tata Sons to act like a private equity investor.Chandrasekarans role so far has been to keep it running smoothly and build on the gains made previously; under him, TCSs market capitalization and revenues grew more than three times. But now, he needs to figure out ways to replicate his success with TCS in unfamiliar businesses.The culture in the IT (information technology) industry is one of youthful exuberance, service orientation, technological innovation and collaborative learningan antithesis to the rough and tough shop-floor realities of old-world industries, wrote Prabal Basu Roy, a Sloan Fellow from the London Business School and a chartered accountant, in a column on 14 January. Therefore, this cultural and skill set mismatch will be a major challengethough charismatic leadership can overcome some of this.But such concerns are brushed aside by Tata insiders.Also read: The many challenges of Natarajan ChandrasekaranIf the group chairman knows everything, it will create over dependence and everyone would look upon him rather than doing it on their own, said K. Santhanakrishnan, non-executive and non-independent director at Tata Global Beverages Ltd. The group needs his soft skills. The hardware already exists in the form of professionally managed boards and professional executive management. His experience in the software industry which has linkages with all the sectors and his wide international exposure and acceptability across, would really help the group.Chandrasekaran takes charge at a time when the group needs a strategic reorientation. With the election of Donald Trump, who has vowed to protect American jobs, as US President and the shift in customers spending patterns from traditional IT services to a digital domain, TCS itself is going to face tough times and may not be able to sustain its dividend track record.At the same time, tough calls have to be made to bring down group debt, which stands at Rs2.25 trillion, and which new businesses to focus on.The reactions I get to my philosophy are heartwarming. No less than a thousand employees responded to my call to run the Mumbai Marathon together, Chandrasekaran said in the Runners World interview.To succeed in his new job and successfully complete the metaphorical marathon he is embarking on, he will need a similar response from the 660,000 employees of Tata group.",2017-01-20,PUT0dMs7Buh2WJTdbafJzM,MintAsia examines the challenges Natarajan Chandrasekaran faces  as he prepares to take the helm at Tata Sons at a time when the group is engaged in an ugly feud with its ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry,both,01:26,Marathon Man

ARM also has a tiny debt load of 9.5 million pounds ($12.6 million) at the end of last year.This is SoftBanks biggest deal since the Sprint purchase was announced in 2012, and its being done at a premium of 43%  on the face of it, a massive strain on the Japanese companys total debt of about ¥11.9 trillion ($112.8 billion) at 31 March.SoftBank shares have fallen in the past year as the company reeled from losses at Sprint, and efforts to turn around the US wireless carrier forced the company to sell almost $10 billion of its stake in a much more successful asset, the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, last month.Affordability isnt necessarily a problem for SoftBank. The stock dipped after founder Masayoshi Sons heir apparent Nikesh Arora abruptly stepped down the day before the UK referendum. But last month, the company sold its majority stake in Supercell, the Finnish maker of the popular Clash of Clans game, for $8.6 billion. Proceeds from that deal, and from the Alibaba disposal, should be booked this year.And SoftBank still has almost $60 billion in Alibaba stock, Japanese mobile operations that make money, and 43% of the countrys biggest and most profitable search engine, Yahoo Japan, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Michelle Ma.Crucially, SoftBank also has ¥2.6 trillion in cash, and operates in a country with negative interest rates.ARM isnt cheap: Its trading at 49 times current earnings, compared with Intels 14.4 times. Only much smaller Chinese peers like Zhuhai Orbita Control Engineering, at 145 times earnings, are more expensive.Unlike Sprint, however, which was struggling before SoftBank bought it, ARM looks like a smart investment that the pounds decline made smarter.

0.62,"The world remains on a fragile recovery path after the 2008 crisis, yet there has been no slowdown in the growth of extreme wealth. From 1996 to 2014, billionaires wealth worldwide has grown six-and-a-half times; for Indian (dollar) billionaires this growth has been a phenomenal 40%, says a paper from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in the US.
				   
				A majority of these billionaires are self made. Data from a paper, The Origins of the Super Rich: The Billionaire Characteristics Database, by Caroline Freund and Sarah Oliver, shows that 63% of Indias billionaires are self made, and their wealth accounts for about 49% of the total wealth of billionaires in the country. In emerging markets, close to 80% of billionaires are self made.In 1996, China did not have a single billionaire. Fast forward to 2014, and the list of Chinese billionaires has risen to 153. Only three of these billionaires have inherited their wealth, and only two have political connections that have helped them expand their fortunes. Within Europe, wealth has moved eastwards, while in Asia, wealth has moved from Japan to China.This fast growth of self made billionaires can be seen in India tooself made billionaires grew their wealth nearly 17 times since 2001, compared to nine times for those who inherited wealth. In Europe, in contrast, billionaire wealth is still largely inherited, and over 20% of inherited billionaires are fourth-generation or later. At close to 50%, Latin America accounts for the largest share of inherited billionaires, followed closely by the Middle East, where about 44% of all billionaires have inherited their wealth.The authors of the paper have one caveat though: their source of data is the Forbes magazine rich list. They say that it is possible that some private companies may not have made it to the list as valuation is difficult. The other concern is that inherited wealth is more likely to be diversified, and thus may have been overlooked. Here are four sets of charts that examine the characteristics of billionaires.The list of inherited billionaires includes names from Indias biggest corporate houses: Kumaramangalam Birla, Venugopal Dhoot, Pankaj Patel and Adi Godrej, to name a few. The technology sector accounts for the greatest share of self made billionaires in India. This is closely followed by the consumer sector, which has names like jeweller Nirav Modi and soft drinks maker Ravi Jaipuria.In 1996, India had only three billionairesDhirubhai Ambani, Lakshmi Mittal and Kumaramangalam Birla. By 2001, Mittal had left this list, but Shiv Nadar and Azim Premji made their entry. The entrance of Nadar and Premji, both of whom built their wealth in the IT sector, was a sign of the riches that leaders of this sector would reap. It took only 13 years for the list of billionaires to grow from five to 56. By 2014, the IT sector in India accounted for seven billionaires.Who are the billionaires who lead consumer firms in India? This list includes leaders of several automotive and related industries such as Rahul Bajaj, Vikram Lal, Baba Kalyani and Lachhman Das Mittal. The richest Indian billionaire is Mukesh Ambani, closely followed by Lakshmi Mittal and Premji.In 1996, there were 31 women billionaires worldwide. By 2014, that number increased by 480% to 180. However, this is way behind the overall rate of increase of billionaires worldwide. Only two Indian women, Savitri Jindal and Indu Jain, are billionaires. Globally, only 43 women are self made billionaires.

0.91,"The Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) have prompted an interesting change in the way companies look at their assets. Following the transition to the new norms, companies assets have seen wide-scale revaluation, resulting in significant profit increases for the earlier quarter as companies restate those results as per the new accounting norms to compare them with the latest quarterly results.
				   
				This offers an opportunity to see how much the changes in the accounting standards have affected company financials. Moreover, the revaluation has been done in such a way that it will continue to act as a tailwind for profits in the days ahead.Property, plant and equipment (PP&E) revaluations account for the biggest adjustments to profits under Ind AS. The total immediate profit impact of adjustments to PP&E is already worth at least Rs10,776 crore, according to a Mint analysis of recent results data from 72 large firms (from among BSE 100 companies) conducted in partnership with consulting firm KPMG. All figures compare the September 2015 numbers under the old accounting standards with numbers calculated under the new rules. The total absolute value of profit adjustments made (including upward and downward revisions) was Rs19,500 crore. PP&E adjustments accounted for Rs10,776 crore or 55.26% of the changes. The equivalent adjustment made for the June quarter was a negative adjustment of Rs68.35 crore.Sai Venkateshwaran, partner and head of accounting advisory services at KPMG in India, said some companies that had written down their assets in the September 2015 quarter under the old accounting norms have revalued these assets to their fair values on transition to Ind AS. This has led to a reversal of some of the earlier write-downs in the September 2015 quarter, which has improved the profits for that quarter when restated under the new norms.ALSO READ | Transition to  Ind Asconnect the dots to see the real pictureAccording to Venkateshwaran, the new standards allow the fair value of PP&E at the date of transition to be used as its deemed cost. Many companies have used this provision to write down certain assets like plant and equipment to their fair value. On the other hand, several companies have also written up assets such as land to their fair value.The write-down of depreciable assets by some of these companies could have a significant, continuing positive impact on their profits in the days ahead, he said.What do these changes mean on the ground?Consider a firm that had total PP&E worth Rs1 lakh. The land was earlier valued at Rs25,000 and the rest of the factory worth Rs75,000. Suppose that when the company revalues it, a higher value is assigned to the land (say Rs60,000) and a lower amount to the rest (Rs40,000 in our example). The non-land portion sees lower depreciation because of this revaluation. Assigning a higher value to land, and a lower value to other assets increases profits because of this lower depreciation. Land is not depreciated.The result of these adjustments was seen in profit gains when September 2015 results were declared.Integrated oil and gas firms made PP&E adjustments of Rs4,058 crore, according to KPMG data. Firms making iron and steel and intermediate products made similar adjustments of Rs7,091.5 crore (see Chart 1).The iron and steel companies saw their profits more than triple to Rs5,705 crore under the new norms. This makes the sector one of the key gainers profit-wise because of net adjustments under the new norms (Rs3,801 crore). Another gainer is the integrated oil and gas segment, which saw profits rise by Rs2,625 crore to Rs9,345 crore.Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities Ltd, said a number of firms have had to mark down their fixed assetsPP&E against reserves, because the new regulations require these assets to be valued at a level which correctly reflects their remaining useful life. This would have had a negative impact on their net worth, which would have adverse implications for firms carrying high debt.ALSO READ | Profiting from new accounting standardsThese companies probably looked at old value land on their books and revalued it upwards by crediting their reserves to markup their net worth, he said.Independent market analyst Anand Tandon said, The accounting standard allows revaluation, so some of this is inevitable. You have to assume that companies will report as per their convenience.The largest adjustments were made by Tata Steel Ltd. Its profits were revised upwards to the tune of Rs7,463.02 crore because of PP&E adjustments. Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) made PP&E adjustments to its profits worth Rs4,058 crore, according to second-quarter results. (Third-quarter results showed zero such adjustments for the December 2015 numbers).Tata Steel did not respond to email, text and telephonic requests for comment.RIL said it had to revise certain assets downwards to abide by the new regulations. At the same time, it revised its land assets upwards and also the impairment of exploration and production assets because of the change in rules.Land which had been acquired over the decades and held at its historical acquisition cost, has been revalued upwards to reflect its fair value on the balance sheet without causing any impact on reported earnings, said an RIL spokesperson.In case of exploration and production assets, the new norms said they should be accounted for using the successful efforts method instead of using full costs, leading to a reversal in impairment taken, the spokesperson added (see Chart 2).The new accounting standards negatively impacted sectors such as commercial vehicles, and breweries and distilleries too. The latter saw profits erode by Rs854 crore. Commercial vehicle companies saw their losses increase from Rs143 crore to Rs1,589 crore.The reconciliation numbers are based on profits as defined by the company. Some firms may use profit numbers after adjusting for minority interest, others would not. There is no set rule for which profit numbers are used for reconciliation purposes. This is why there is a difference between adjustments by reconciliation numbers and the impact on the more well-tracked profit after tax numbers. The profit after tax number is calculated on a uniform basis across companies.Profits for the 72 companies are up by Rs1,011 crore, or 1.6%, to Rs64,321 crore.This is in spite of Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) dropping 3.72%. The overall Ebitda figure dropped to Rs1.32 trillion on account of the transition to the new accounting standards.Other factors including lower taxes also helped result in higher after-tax profits. This year is the first in which companies are following the new norms.All companies with a net worth of Rs500 crore or more have to abide by the new norms from 1 April 2016. It will apply to those with a net worth of Rs250 crore one year later. Financial institutions such as banks and non-banking financial companies will have to follow Ind AS from 1 April 2018.Whats the big deal? Companies have revised profits upwards citing PP&E (property, plant and equipment) adjustments. The value of these adjustments is already in excess of Rs10,000 crore, shows the latest quarterly comparison. A look into the changes show that they are the outcome of balance-sheet adjustments made after the new accounting standards came into effect. Experts says many companies have had to revise some assets downwards because of stringent new norms.This would have affected net worth of already indebted companies. So, some have chosen to revise land value upwards to preserve net worth, resulting in the changes seen. This in turn is reflected in the latest disclosed financials. An analysis of financials shows that land has been given higher value and other assets are valued lower. This will lower depreciation and increase profit numbers in the days ahead as well.",2017-01-31,PxA2QFXfQ5hkiS9egHPXfM,"Property, plant and equipment revaluations account for the biggest adjustments to profits of 72 large BSE 100 companies under Ind AS, finds a Mint-KPMG analysis",company,01:31,"The Rs10,000 crore profit adjustment"

				The banks gross non-performing assets (NPAs) more than doubled to Rs32,178.60 crore in the three months ended 30 September from Rs15,857 crore a year ago. Gross NPAs made up 6.82% of the banks loan book, compared to 5.87% in the previous quarter and 3.77% in the year-ago quarter.Total slippages, or new bad loans, during the quarter, including slippages from restructured loan book and watch list of corporate loans, stood at Rs8,000 crore.At the end of the March quarter, the bank had created a watch list of loans worth Rs44,065 crore. These were sub-investment grade loans which were at risk of slipping into the non-performing loans category.More than Rs9,100 crore of these loans turned bad during the first six months of the year and Rs2,461 crore of loans in this category got upgraded during the same period. The watch list of loans now was reduced to Rs32,490 crore at the end of the September quarter.From the two large deals, i.e. the sale of cement plant by Jaypee Prakash Industries and sale of Essar Oil, we expect significant reduction in portfolio over 6-9 months, subject to necessary approvals and subject to transactions getting completed. We have received some amount in October 2016 which are part of the planned repayment arising out of these resolutions, said Chanda Kochhar, managing director and chief executive officer of ICICI Bank, in a call with journalists after the earnings announcement.Kochhar added that the bank continues to focus on reducing exposure to stressed sectors like power, iron and steel, mining, cement and rigs. The total exposure to these sectors decreased from 13% at the end of March to 11.9% at the end of September.As a result of higher slippages, provisions rose 651% from a year ago to Rs7,082.69 crore.

The brokerage house has revisited its estimates for farm income and reduced estimated total income growth of 6%/13% y-o-y for a small/large farmer in FY17, from 12%/17% earlier.

				PVR will benefit with around 4-5% Ebitda margin expansion, if GST rate is at 18% while Inox Leisure will benefit with an approximately 2-4% Ebitda margin expansion, pointed out analysts from Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and is a measure of operating profit. For the June quarter, even though both companies saw decent consolidated revenue growth, profit declined a bit primarily on account of muted operating performance. Advertising revenue growth was slower than expected. PVRs advertising revenue increased 13%, slower than in the previous two quarters. This was mainly on account of an increase in the share of regional (Sairat) and Hollywood-dubbed (Jungle Book) movies during the quarter, explains Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd in its post-results update. Regional and dubbed Hollywood movies attract lower advertising rates compared with Bollywood movies. During the June quarter, a higher proportion of box-office collections came from Marathi movie Sairat and the dubbed Jungle Book. Inox Leisures advertising revenue increased by a low 3%. Thats because after ad rates increased in December 2015, markets have not yet adjusted. The fall in occupancy rates was compensated to some extent by an increase in average ticket prices for both companies. PVRs operating profit increased 5.4% year-on-year to Rs.117 crore while that of Inox Leisure declined 3.8% to Rs.62 crore. Both companies saw a decline in operating profit margin compared with last years June quarter. Despite higher other income and decline in finance costs, PVRs reported profit after tax declined 1.7% to Rs.43 crore. PVRs tax outgo was substantially higher.

0.31,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday eased the rules for various stressed asset resolution schemes and expanded the scope of a loan recast plan previously limited to the infrastructure sector.
				   
				RBI also streamlined the process for change of ownership of stressed assets outside of the so-called strategic debt restructuring (SDR) process, which allowed creditors to convert debt into equity and take over the management of defaulting companies.Under its latest loan resolution plan, the scheme for sustainable structuring of stressed assets (S4A), RBI has allowed banks to classify at least half the debt involved as a standard assets.Under S4A guidelines, first announced in June, banks were allowed to split the funded liabilities of a stressed company into sustainable and unsustainable debt. The sustainable debt would be left alone to perform or be restructured if necessary, while the unsustainable debt would be converted into equity or equity-like, long-dated securities and redeemed at a later date.The revised norms say in case a non-performing asset (NPA) is restructured under S4A norms, the sustainable part of the debt can be classified as standard if banks set aside provisions equal to at least 50% of the debt classified as unsustainable or 20% of aggregate debt, whichever his higher.For this purpose, the provisions already held in the account can be reckoned, RBI guidelines said. When these norms were introduced in June,  if the account was an NPA on the reference date, banks were asked to classify both halves as an NPA even when S4A restructuring was under process. In case the account is standard when it goes into S4A, the entire outstanding debt will remain standard, subject to provisions made upfront by the lenders being at least 40% of the unsustainable amount or 20% of the aggregate outstanding, whichever is higher.Since standard assets require lower provisions, this would require banks to set a smaller amount aside.RBI also said the unsustainable part of debt in any S4Awhether the account was NPA or standard at the time of restructuringcould be upgraded to standard, if the sustainable half of the debt performed satisfactorily for one year. Banks would also be allowed to reverse all provisions made when the unsustainable half of the debt is upgraded. However, in all cases, the required mark-to-market provisions on instruments after conversion of unsustainable debt must be maintained at all times.In the so-called 5/25 scheme, which allowed loan payments to be stretched out, RBI has increased the coverage to all sectors. It has also allowed smaller projectswhere banks have at least Rs250 crore exposureto qualify for this scheme.Not all rules have been eased. In SDR, RBI said banks cannot book income after 90 days of invoking the scheme even though they continue to classify the asset as standard.In cases where banks have decided to change ownership in a firm outside SDR norms, deadlines were set for these changes. According to RBI, the conversion of debt into equity  should be completed in  90 days from date of approval by a lending consortium or the joint lender forum. In case  a pledge of equity shares is invoked, it has set a deadline of 180 days.

The goal of the conspiracy was to suppress and eliminate competition in the trading of the euro and the dollar in the US, UK and Switzerland, according to the charges.The case represents the culmination of the governments promise to prosecute individuals at the center of one of the biggest market-manipulation investigations of the Obama administration.

-0.25,"The juggernaut of digital advertising continues to roll ahead, undeterred by sceptics and naysayers who are questioning if brands have already over-invested in the medium. As we cross the chasm of adoption and enter the eye of the tornado, 2017 will provide the perfect space and time for a little reflection. 
				   
				The story of six blind people describing an elephant has an interesting parallel in the world of digital advertising. We have been deluged by techno-babble around search, social, video, mobile, native and programmaticthrow in a couple more in the room and now you have programmable (distinct from programmatic) and AI (artificial intelligence) to add on to the ever-growing list of stuff that makes up digital advertising. First, some numbers to set the context. Digital advertising in India is forecast to breach the $1 billion milestone in 2016-17. There is a lot of headroom for growth, when you look at the rapidly growing smartphone consumer base over the next five yearsprojected to rise 4x, up to 820 million. A more compelling indicator for digital spends that can ride this wave is the uptick in data consumption; climbing up at a compounded annual growth rate of 30% and projected to reach 7GB/month (per active user) by 2021 (according to the Ericsson Mobility Report of 2016). So why does digital ad spending in India still stand at just 15% of the total advertising pie, unlike the over 40% share in evolved markets? Where does the problem lie? I believe that the advertising model for digital in India is fundamentally broken. Very little responsible action has been taken by publishers and media agencies and to some extent even clients, rendering a large part of such a potent medium ineffective. Digital advertising is all about effectivenessand we all grew up to understand this is the only medium that has the power to deliver the relevant signals from consumers. And yet, in the limited buying exercises we conducted in 2016, we saw publishers turning a blind eye to traffic quality and relevance of audience profile. Unfathomable performance metrics and targeting parameters are spun out as yarns; many clients fall hook, line and sinker for these. Search will continue to reign over display despite its limitations to deliver scale. For categories that score high on digital influence (consumers researching online) and digital density (consumers buying online), measuring intent is keyand search will be simply unbeatable in capturing intent-laden traffic emanating on the horizontal screen. Content will be the game changer in categories that are digital emergent and score low on both influence and density. Brands that will consistently invest in content will have more success in influencing the influencers. A leading few will be able to articulate a vision leveraging such content for communities and launch their brand-as-a-service to fulfil some need gaps.Mobile is the tricky part to understand. While time spent on the vertical screen is witnessing an inexorable rise, the platform choice is influenced by content, and behaviour is heavily skewed to messaging, social, entertainment and news. Time spent using the mobile browser is more than native apps in developing economies, and India is no exception as local research suggests. Advertising choices on the mobile are thus far more compelling yet terribly complex. Native advertising makes the best sense of all available options backing search, especially for brands investing heavily in content. Forecasts that indicate this format reaching 75% (of total display advertising) in mature markets like the US, make complete sense as of now. But where does native work bestsocial, in-publisher feed, or sponsored content? It is a tough question that can best be answered by the format of advertising you choose.Videos have a really, really bad track record on social, and Facebook has been struggling to revise recommended metrics of meaningful video consumption. Certainly, Facebook scores over any other platform in its innate ability to spread content, but when it comes to video, the numbers have to be taken with a pinch of salt. In fact, for advertising content (including brand story telling) delivered via video, I have found YouTube to return far more tangible value. Shares are a great number to flaunt on social, but barring the outliers, the effectiveness of advertising views is extremely poor when you have little control on how your content spreads. Not everyone who shares your video actually watches it completely. What needs fixing in 2017?We need clarity on what large publishers are throwing at our face in terms of targetingwhether it is audience in-market or audience insights. We accept many such publisher definitions at face value, and there is no vehicle for grievance redress when the performances dont match up to the promise. Viewable impressions (and related discussions on ad fraud) have just started being addressed with new technologies, and this needs strong push in the coming years. What needs terribly urgent fixing, and nearer home, is blatant corruption by some publishers who outsource traffic generation to farms (both human and bots), and media agencies that hand-in-glove push bulk-buys from such publishers. Clients have to take a fair share of responsibility for landing the industry in this mess because they refuse to pay the required service fees to an agency to run digital media with brains. The bulk buying metrics that work for mainline media are applied to digital by old-school media buyers; and at 3% commissions with no accountability on performance, everyone just ends up pulling a fast one on each other.At the end of the day, it is simple for you to examine traffic quality, to arrive at your own conclusions about who is clean and who is tainted. Which platform was more effective for completed videos views? Did the high number of shares on your contagious content reach the targeted audience? What percentage of the traffic on your website disappeared under 10 seconds? You have to start asking the hard questions and stand up to your management and speak the brutal truth.Takeaways for 2017 Experiment always: There has never been a better time to experiment with formats and newer platforms. With emergence of 360 degree video and Live (broadcast live like Twitter with Periscope, Facebook Live etc.), the possibility of creative in-feed advertising content has taken a leap forward. Splurge some money on interactive content advertising and learn from the engagement data.Approach hype with cautious optimism: The dynamics of digital introduces new technology every year that in turn triggers hype cycles. You can choose to skip some, like Dynamic Creative Optimization or VR (Virtual Reality is certainly the next big thing in content). Adobe has demonstrated use of technology to change subject lines of e-mailers to counter ad-fatigue, and I am a big believer in dynamic emailers that compose content on the flyso maybe that is something worth pursuing if you are big on triggered e-mailersstuff that dominates early part of your relationship with a subscriber (before fatigue sets in).Invest in dashboard technology: Measure your key performance indicators. You will need a bespoke dashboard using smart widgets that track share of search, product sentiment, audience recency/loyalty and purchase intent, etc. You must track social presence and advertising effectiveness. Conduct an interaction health check. Most importantly, split the management view (input vs. output) from the practitioners, so you can demonstrate return on investment. Wire up your assets: For those who have reached a mature state of digital marketing running multiple brand assets (web, social, apps), 2017 will be time to wire them up using consumer-profiling technology. A mature digital business needs to know consumers better to be able to deliver smarter advertising. Capturing the state of mind of your audience is a crucial departure you can make with programmable advertising. Understand digital for offline: Connecting online advertising with offline sales is the next holy grail of accountability and few publishers are doing pioneering work in the area. Experiment with advertising that supports the consumer decision journey (ROPOresearch online, purchase offline) instead of banal re-targeting.Focus on quality: Stop spending money in the wrong places. Find the right partner to support your vision and make sure you work out a compensation structure that incentivizes your partner to deliver quality.

				For the year to March 2016, Twitter Communications India Pvt. Ltds revenue rose to Rs42.7 crore from Rs13.27 crore in the previous year, according to documents posted with the ministry of corporate affairs. Twitter also managed to eke out a meagre profit from its Indian operations. Net profit rose to Rs3.5 crore for fiscal 2016 from Rs1.1 crore in the previous year.Still, India accounted for a paltry 0.29% of the $2.21 billion Twitter generated globally in the same period. The India numbers also underscore that Twitter has not been able to make a significant dent in the market share battle in the Indian online advertising that is dominated by Google India, which generated over Rs4,000 crore (over $500 million) in revenue in 2014-15.Indias digital advertising market is expected to grow to more than Rs7,000 crore this calendar year, according to a January report from media agency GroupM, part of global advertising group WPP Plc.Staff expenses for Twitter in India also rose about three times from last year to about Rs16.5 crore, primarily on the back of some high-profile hires. Twitter has, however, applied the brakes on hiring in India. A Twitter spokesperson did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment about the companys India numbers.Last week, Mint reported the India business of Twitter Inc. is in disarray after the abrupt departures of six senior executives and the failure of ZipDial, the $35 million acquisition that was meant to drive the social networks growth in the country, but was junked by chief executive Jack Dorsey.Apart from Rishi Jaitly and Parminder Singh, whose exits were confirmed by Twitter, four other senior executives at Twitter India have left: ZipDial co-founders Valerie Wagoner and Amiya Pathak; Gaurav Agrawal (head of growth operations); and Nandu Madhava (director of growth).",2016-11-09,QeqWlbQYooN8j1YnGWUKhP,Twitter Indias net profit rose to Rs3.5 crore for fiscal 2016 from Rs1.1 crore in the previous year,company,02:15,Twitter posts threefold rise in India revenue to Rs42.7 crore in FY16

Under the revised terms, PVR will now add 32 screens with the acquisition, compared with the earlier estimate of 39 screens. Nonetheless, the deal closure is good news.The DT Cinemas acquisition and its organic screen addition will help PVR clock 608 and 664 screens in financial year 2017 (FY17) and financial year 2018 (FY18), respectively, according to ICICI Securities Ltd.It is expected to report ATPs (average ticket prices) of Rs.207 and Rs.218 in FY17E and FY18E, respectively, wrote analysts from ICICI Securities in a note on 31 May.The report further added that major growth in ATPs would stem from DT Cinemas screens, which operate at a superior ATP i.e. at ~15-20% premium to that of PVR. At March end, PVR had 516 screens.On the other hand, Inox Leisure Ltd plans to add 89 new screens for financial year 2017, leading to 509 screens by the year end.PVRs ATP during the past quarter had increased 8.3% from a year earlier to Rs.182, while that of Inox rose by 5.7% to Rs.167.While both the companies fared well in the seasonally weak March quarter and posted good growth in operating profit, PVRs performance was better.Further, PVRs advertising revenue growth at 19.3% looks far superior to the 2% decline in advertising revenue that Inox reported. A delay in the absorption of advertising rate hikes has taken a toll on Inoxs advertising revenue lately. Even as both the companies reported an operating profit, higher depreciation costs and finance expenses led them to post pre-tax losses.Still, the year as a whole proved to be rather good, what with movies such as Baahubali-The Beginning, Bajrangi Bhaijaan, Tanu Weds Manu Returns, Avengers, Piku, etc. performing well at the box office.The upshot: PVRs pre-tax and exceptional item profit increased to Rs.149 crore for financial year 2016 from Rs.14.6 crore for financial year 2015, a somewhat dull year for cinema performance.Similarly, the measure for Inox increased to Rs.89.5 crore from Rs.16.5 crore.What about the current financial year?Well, the year has begun well with the success of The Jungle Book and the content pipeline is looking strong.But will this year be better than the last?

The positives are: Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin has expanded 3.3 percentage points from a year ago to 15.6%; and net profit has jumped 71% to Rs.814 crore. But this was no less than what investors had expected. Now, a lot rides on a good monsoon with one out of every two motorcycles/scooters being sold in rural India. Even then, any spurt in volume growth might not be evident till the harvest season. Heros management said it is looking at a low to mid-single-digit growth in the first half of the current fiscal year.
				   
				Volume growth might not also be easy to come by in the medium-term because of its relatively weaker presence in the two fastest growing categoriesscooters and premium motorcycles.Heros forte is the executive segment which comprises about 56% of the motorcycle market, but this is also the category that is increasingly being cannibalized by scooters, owing to similar price points. Still, the companys two recent launchesMaestro Edge and Duethave helped it overtake TVS Motor Co. Ltd in the last quarter, even as it increases capacity.However, the premium bike segment launch pipeline looks a little lean right now. The management said in a post-earnings conference call that work is happening in multiple segments and products, when asked about premium bikes.Any ambitious increase in exports will also take time to come simply because the conditions are not right in major export destinations for Indian two-wheeler makers.Trying to get a better toehold in the fast-growing scooter and premium bike segments might increase the companys research and development, and advertising expenses. Other expenses in the March quarter were at an eight-quarter high of 13.7% (to sales) already.The firm might have also seen its margins peaking. The commodity price meltdown has bottomed out and prices are slowly increasing. Material costs were 66% of sales in the March quarter, an almost 4 percentage point improvement from a year ago. They are only likely to rise from here on. The firm itself has guided for a sustainable Ebitda margin of 14-15%, even as it continues its cost-reduction programme.Shares of Hero are trading at 16.8 times their expected earnings for this fiscal year, a tad above their average price-to-earnings multiple.

-0.73,"San Francisco: Facebook Inc.s fourth-quarter revenue climbed more than forecast, driven by advertisers continued push to reach consumers on mobile phones.
				   
				The worlds largest social-media company said sales jumped 51% to $8.81 billion, topping the $8.51 billion average analyst projection. Monthly active users on its main social network increased 17% from a year earlier to 1.86 billion people, with 1.23 billion checking daily and 1.74 billion accessing it via their smartphones, Facebook said Wednesday in a statement.Facebook has solidified its position as No. 2 in the market for mobile advertising, behind Alphabet Inc.s Google. The Menlo Park, California-based company last year started selling more marketing spots and added e-commerce tools to Instagram, its photo-sharing app that now has more than 600 million users. Facebook also expanded video advertising, drawing ad dollars that might otherwise have gone to television commercials.Facebook and Google are the two foundational elements to all digital advertising, said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group. Theyre just so big in terms of how much time people spend on the platform, and no advertisers goals need go unmet if theyre using Facebook.Mobile advertising made up about 84% of total ad revenue in the quarter, Facebook said.Profit excluding some items was $1.41 a share, compared to the $1.31 average analyst estimate, according to data gathered by Bloomberg. Facebook shares rose as much as 3.6% in extended trading, following the report. The stock closed at $133.23 in New York.Slower growthFacebooks revenue gains had been expected to slow this year because the company has said it wont keep increasing the percentage of ads shown in users News Feeds. That means its leaning on other growing areas, like Instagram, as well as new forms of advertising, such as ads in live video. Meanwhile, the company has said it plans to substantially increase its spending on new data centers and engineers.Theres effectively no change in the outlook, chief financial officer David Wehner said in an interview. We continue to invest aggressively to grow out the business for the long term.Advertisers have expected better service from Facebook as the company becomes more mature. Late last year, Facebook had to correct the methodology for some of the metrics it was reporting to advertisers, which in many cases overstated user engagement. That shook confidence in the effectiveness of Facebooks ads, though none of the revisions affected advertiser billing.As Facebooks influence grows, its users have also started to hold it more accountable for its role in society. Around the US presidential election last year, the company faced an uproar over the use of its social network to spread fake news. Earlier in 2016, Facebook had to combat claims that it was biased against conservatives. Now, the company is part of a debate about the Trump administrations policies, with its top two executives, chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg and chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, speaking out against his executive orders.The events of the last year reinforced the importance of connecting the world, Zuckerberg said on a conference call.Still, when it comes to the business, Facebook doesnt expect to be negatively affected by any new immigration restrictions.Weve got other markets in which we can recruit and grow engineering and technical teams, like London and Tel Aviv, Wehner said.Earlier, a federal court jury in Dallas said Oculus, the virtual reality headset maker bought by Facebook in 2014, used technology stolen from ZeniMax Media Inc. to develop its device.

0.3,"New Delhi: The dispute between the government and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) over the latters alleged production of gas from a Krishna Godavari basin reservoir it shares with state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) seems headed for a protracted battle. The oil ministry has asked for views from Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), the law ministry and in-house legal experts on whether it should proceed to recover the $1.55 billion compensation demanded from RIL while an arbitration remains pending.
				   
				The oil ministry has also sought their views on the measures that could be taken to ensure that production of gas does not decline further from RILs KG D6 block so that any move to recover the compensation from the sales revenue of gas from the KG DWN 98/3 (KG D6) block does not suffer, a person with direct knowledge of the development said on condition of anonymity. RIL reported production of 139.1 billion cubic feet of gas from the block in 2015-16.An email sent to RIL on Tuesday remained unanswered at the time of going to press.The person quoted above said that the government was merely addressing all aspects of the dispute as per the law and was not being vengeful to an investor. We are only taking steps to protect governments revenue interest in an objective manner as any government of the day will do in any given dispute. The provisions of the law will take its course, said the person.After the oil ministry raised the compensation claim on 4 November, Reliance proposed an arbitration to resolve the issue. Accordingly, the government nominated G.S. Singhvi, a former Supreme Court judge and former Competition Appellate Tribunal (Compat) chairman, as its arbitrator, Mint reported on 26 December. Singhvi, along with RILs nominee on the arbitration panel, Bernard Eder, a former high court judge in the UK, are now in the process of finalizing a third neutral umpire arbitrator for the panel.The ministry raised the compensation demand after the Justice A.P. Shah panel, which looked into ONGCs claim of gas flow between the neighbouring fields of the two companies, recommended on 31 August that RIL should compensate for the unfair enrichment it had by way of retaining the gains of gas flow into its block KG D6. The panel was appointed after the Delhi high court, on a petition from ONGC, asked the government to resolve the issue in a transparent way, keeping in mind provisions of the law and applying principles of natural justice.The panel, which lacked technical expertise on determining whether gas flowed from ONGCs block to RILs, relied upon a report by consultant DeGolyer and MacNaughton, jointly hired by the companies, to say that between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2015, about 11 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas migrated to KG D6 from adjacent fields, of which RIL benefited from 8.9 bcm. RIL in a 4 November statement said that its liability to pay compensation had not been established by any process known to law. The claim of the government is based on misreading and misinterpretation of key elements of the production sharing contract and is without precedent in the oil and gas industry, anywhere in the world RIL remains convinced of being able to fully justify and vindicate its position that the governments claim is not sustainable, the company had said then. Experts said disputes often arise on account of volatility in the energy sector as well as from multiple interpretations of the contract.The government has to ensure that investors get a reasonable return on their investments in the oil and gas sector compared to what they would get from other markets or from other industries.

0.45,"New Delhi/Mumbai: Consolidation in Indias $27 billion telecom industry received a massive boost with Vodafone Group Plc. confirming that it is in talks for a merger of its Indian unit with Aditya Birla Groups Idea Cellular Ltd.
				   
				The proposed merger will create the nations largest telecom firm with combined revenue of Rs78,000 crore and a 43% share of the market hitherto dominated by Bharti Airtel Ltd, which reported annual revenue of Rs50,008 crore from local telecom operations in the last financial year.Vodafone confirms that it is in discussion with the Aditya Birla Group about an all share merger of Vodafone India (excluding Vodafones 42% stake in Indus Towers) and Idea, British company Vodafone Group said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange on Monday.With Vodafone India Ltds tower unit out of the proposed merger, Vodafone Group and the Aditya Birla Group will be almost equal partners. The two would have equal rights in the new company, said Idea.ALSO READ | Vodafones idea for an escape route from its Indian tormentThe consolidation has been triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, in which parent Reliance Industries Ltd has invested a staggering $25 billion.Since the launch of its services in September, Jio has offered free voice and data and signed up more than 72 million users, forcing rivals, including Vodafone India and Idea, to slash tariffs in response.Vodafone Group had to write off 5 billion in its Indian business last year and defer a proposed share sale which will become irrelevant should the merger go through; Idea is already listed on the exchanges and the merged entity will automatically be listed.ALSO READ | Ideas shares surge on Vodafone merger talks, so do AirtelsWhen a rival with deep pockets enters the market with an investment as huge as Rs1.5 trillion, and starts offering free services, it is bound to put pressure on others, said Ajay Bodke, chief executive and chief portfolio manager at brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd. Consolidation makes sense in such times.The combined entity will exceed the maximum user base limit of 50% in as many as nine licence areas and revenue market share will surpass the 50% threshold in five circles, according to a telecom analyst who declined to be named.That, analysts say, is unlikely to pose a significant hurdle for the merger.The rapid expansion of Jios user base will prevent the merged entity from breaching the subscriber base limit, added the analyst cited above. The combination will also give the merged entity substantial spectrum musclenearly 28% of the spectrum in the key Delhi and Mumbai markets where Idea has a weak footprint.ALSO READ | Airtel may lose market leaders position, courtesy Vodafone-Idea merger, Jio entryThe telecom department rules restricting an entitys holding to no more than 50% of the spectrum in a given band and 25% of the spectrum assigned in a circle would mean that the merged entity would have to surrender spectrum in Kerala in the 900 megahertz (MHz) band and in Gujarat and Maharashtra in the 2,500MHz band. The merged entity could sell the additional spectrum in almost five circles to Airtel or Jio. We believe that a potential Idea/Vodafone merger could make strategic sense (move to No.1 market share, scale/synergy benefits, and complementary footprint with Vodafone strong in urban areas and Idea strong in rural areas), Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note on Monday. The brokerage suggested that the merged entity would realize an increased Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of 9-12% as a result of synergies in operating expenditure arising from the merger.Jios entry has also forced rivals to make huge investments, leading to mounting debts for all operators.With current level of wafer-thin margins, it is uneconomical to invest more in acquiring contiguous territories, spectrum or upgrade into 4G or LTE technology. Hence, consolidation is inevitable, said Singapore-based Sanjay Guglani, chief investment officer at Silverdale Funds.Ideas net debt is expected to cross Rs55,000 crore by the end of March 2017. Its second-quarter profit for financial year 2017 fell 88% to Rs91 crore from Rs762 crore in the year ago period. Analysts says that Ideas December quarter performance could be worse. The company was due to announce its third quarter results on 23 January but told stock exchanges it has postponed it without further notifying when the results would be published. For Vodafone, net debt was at Rs76,800 crore for the half year ended September 2016. That came down to Rs35,430 crore in November after an infusion of Rs47,700 crore from the parent.As far as debt in concerned, from a lenders perspective too, a merger would be encouraged.

You are in the process of raising a large distressed asset fund. Where does that stand now?Our total idea is to target and invest Rs12,000-14,000 crore in the stressed asset businesses. About Rs5,000 crore comes from CDPQ; Edelweiss itself has been investing up to Rs1,000-1,500 crore every year which over the next four years would be about Rs 4,000 -5,000 crore. Another Rs4,000 crore would come from other investors in the stressed asset fund. Based on where we are now, we think that we can put up to Rs3,000 crore to work every year, so over four years, that does not sound too bad. There is a lot of interest for our stressed asset fund, but we wanted to close the CDPQ deal first. It should take about three to six months for the stressed asset fund to close. How are you beefing up your turnaround operations?We have hired a team of consultants, who have already started working on four or five projects at hand. We are also creating a network of experts of retired PSU executives and bank executives, who know how to deal with the stressed assets. Hard to put a number, but we would have about 200 such experts on our team right now, from segments like steel, cement, automobiles, etc. We are also tying up with a few consulting firms like EY, who can provide support in monitoring cash flows in these stressed companies. Stressed assets is a broad term that can mean quite a few things. What are your focus areas in this?This is a very flexible space for us. So what you say stressed could be either where the balancesheet is stretched, or where the companys capital structure needs a rework or even where company needs extra capital. There are a lot of opportunities that we are seeing where the asset is not stressed yet but if something is not done soon, it can get stressed.ALSO READ | Edelweiss, CDPQ to invest $750 mn in stressed assetsA small amount of capital early on can mean a lot more than a large amount of capital when the firm has become stressed.

What is the overall vision for Edelweiss?The idea is to grow further. Historically if you see, we have grown organically very well, but as and when an opportunity comes along, we jump in.

-0.15,"CES debuted gadget hits like the VCR, CD player and Xbox over the years, but the popular consumer electronics conference also showcases a lot of technology that fails to match the hype.
				   
				Some of the top flops from 50 years of the Las Vegas show include Digital Audio Tape players, Apples Newton handheld computer and Ataris Jaguar gaming console. Here are some of the more recent disappointments from CES.1) Smart GlassesGoogle kicked off a wave of optimism about internet-connected eyewear when it unveiled Google Glass at its developer conference in April 2013. At CES in early 2014, there were a bunch on show, including the Epson Moverio BT-200 and Vergence Labs Epiphany glasses which let the wearer control drones with hand gestures. As of early 2017, there were no mainstream smart glasses selling in high volumes. Google Glass flopped. Apple Inc. is working on the technology, but hasnt released a product yet.2) 3D PrintersThis was the anointed technology at CES 2013. The CubeX from 3D Systems Inc. won a Best of CES for emerging technology that year. 3D printers have made steady progress since then, especially for industrial uses, but they arent in a lot of homes or offices. MakerBot, a pioneer in the sector that had a strong presence in 2013, has cut staff amid declining sales. Stratasys Ltd. bought MakerBot in 2013, and its share price hit a record in January 2014. The stock is down more than 75% since then. 3D Systems shares are down about the same amount in that period.3) Lily, GoPro DronesStartup Lily Robotics won a coveted CES 2016 innovation award for its autonomously steered camera drone. A working version of the gadget wasnt shown at the conference and shipping dates have been delayed. GoPro Inc. founder Nick Woodman took to the stage at the same CES to tease more information about his companys Karma drone. That gadget finally went on sale in October, but the company recalled thousands of them after they lost power. GoPro was back at CES this year showing off the Karma and the company said it will re-launch the drone later in 2017.4) HoverboardsAt CES 2016, makers of hoverboards battled over which company came up with the technology and related designs. The electric skateboards were gaining in popularity, thanks in part to celebrities like Justin Bieber posting shots of themselves zipping around on the devices. So there was a lot at stake. But things turned sour when US federal marshals raided the CES booth of a Chinese hoverboard maker. Future Motion, a Silicon Valley startup, said it invented and patented a self-balancing electric skateboard that looked strikingly similar to the ones the marshals confiscated. Less than two months later, Amazon.com Inc. and other big retailers stopped selling hoverboards after the US Consumer Product Safety Commission deemed them unsafe, saying they pose an unreasonable risk of fire if they didnt meet voluntary safety standards. No hoverboards on the market met those standards, it added at the time.5) PebblePebble Technology Corp. was the belle of the CES 2013 ball when the startup announced its smartwatch would ship in late January. The following year its Pebble Steel model made several Best of CES lists including The Verges Best Smartwatch. Alas, the company is no more. Struggling under the weight of its debt, the company sold software assets to Fitbit Inc. last month. Pebble hardware projects are no more and it isnt actively supporting existing watches. Too bad for buyers wowed by their showing at CES.6) SmartwatchesAt CES 2014, a year after Pebbles debut, dozens of smartwatches were shown. Google unveiled its Android Wear smartwatch platform a few months later, and Apple announced its Watch in September of that year. The hope was that smartwatches would be the next hot gadget to rival the smartphone. But by the third quarter of 2016, global smartwatch sales were down 52% from a year earlier, according to research firm IDC.7) The Dell Venue 8 7000 tabletCalling it the thinnest tablet in the world, CES listed Dell Inc.s Venue 8 device among its 2015 Best of Innovation Award Honorees. It was part of an attempt by Intel Corp. to get its components into more tablets and other mobile devices. The tablet featured an Intel RealSense camera and Atom processor. However, last year Dell stopped selling the tablets. Intel managed to sneak a chip into some of the latest iPhones, but the semiconductor giant still hasnt cracked mobile.

-0.31,"New Delhi: In a setback to Cairn India, the Delhi high court on Tuesday rejected its plea seeking permission to export surplus crude from Barmer oil fields in Rajasthan.
				   
				Under a production sharing contract (PSC) between Cairn India, a Vedanta group company, and state explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC), it could sell surplus crude oil only to government and its nominees.The terms of the PSC allowed Cairn get 70% of crude from the well while the state-owned company would get 30%. The plea is bereft of merits, stands dismissed, said Justice Manmohan who pronounced the order.He added that company could resort to dispute resolution mechanism under the PSC to address the issue of export of surplus crude.The oil and gas exploration company through the hearings had maintained that it should be allowed to export its surplus crude as private domestic refineries in India were not offering competitive prices with respect to the international market.It said that they were agreeable to offering the domestic players in the country the first option to buy the crude, but at international prices.Due to neither the government, nor its nominees or public sector refineries willing to purchase its crude, Cairn contended that it was forced to sell to two private refineriesReliance and Essar, at a loss since these prices were not internationally competitive.The Centre had reiterated that the countrys no-export policy on crude as long as the country does not attain self sufficiency could not be changed.Additional Solicitor General, Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre told the court crude oil per se was not allowed to be exported. He said that India had a total refining capacity of 223 million tonnes. However, at present only 38 million tonnes of crude oil was available. It would not be in the interest of the country to export crude, he argued.Cairn India, however, argued that the countrys foreign trade policy did not bar export of crude.",2016-10-18,S3WuY3SsNVQ7NJkpCXiXvN,Delhi HC cites a production sharing contract between Cairn India and ONGC to bar the Vedanta group firm from exporting surplus crude to any third party,both,11:36,Cairn India cannot export surplus crude from Barmer oilfields: Delhi HC

				Edited excerpts: This year is shaping up to be perhaps the roughest ever for Indias technology companies. How do you think Indian start-up ecosystem should prepare themselves going forward?The startp-up ecosystem in India is evolving and as per the latest report by Nasscom- ZINNOV, India will be home to 10,500 start-ups by 2020. However, there is still a long way to go for the start-ups. On one hand, the start-ups need to come up with very deeply differentiated business models which will add value to their customers, and at the same time make their processes efficient and frugal - for example, leverage existing API (application programming interface) s as much as possible to build products rather than developing products from scratch. They need to make their investments work twice as hard to build their business in 2017 and beyond. Another example of things that can help is to be very user focused when they build their business vs being product feature-focused. Alignment to the end user is critical at an early stage and start-ups must embed design thinking aspect as they build their product.When it comes to global ecosystems, London is the first thing on ones mind when you talk fintech. What do you think of the fintech opportunity in India?The fintech industry has gained momentum in India since the beginning of 2015. The industry witnessed the emergence of numerous fintech start-ups, incubators, and investments from public and private investors. The key enablers in the industry like government policies, regulatory framework coupled with various banks like ICICI and AXIS coming up with their accelerators to work along with entrepreneurs has helped to drive the momentum in India. The fintech start-ups are further leveraging various government initiatives like Jan Dhan Yojna, Aadhaar, and Digital India and we will see a lot of innovation happening in this space in the coming years. While there is a lot of growth opportunity for this sector, the companies also need to look at greater collaboration between various players and amalgamate learnings and entrepreneurial experiences for further growth of this sector. There should also be a cohesive fintech environment built for complete infrastructure penetration. We are witnessing some innovation in the P2P (peer-to-peer) lending, robo advisory, bank-in-a-box, security and biometrics areas which are treading fast towards mass market implementation, with technology like blockchain just marking its entry with a promising future for the fintech companies.What is your take on Indian governments approach to the start-up ecosystem in India?The government has launched many progressive programs to address the requirements of the start-up ecosystem in India. (With) Start Up India, along with programmes like Make in India, the government is giving a further boost to the start-up community. Government is also focusing on making start-ups leverage new age technologies and has set up National Initiative for Development and Harnessing Innovations (NIDHI), an umbrella programme which aims to nurture ideas and innovations in the start-up ecosystem. ...friendly policies like waiving income tax on their profit for the first three years, a simple exit policy, fast tracking of the patent applications, 80% exemption in patent fee, self-certification based compliance system etc are bold move to get more young minds in the start-up space. There can be more work done to support the growth of start-ups in India by driving structured collaboration between government and corporates. We believe that with emergence of new technologies like cognitive, cloud, IoT (Internet of Things), design thinking etc. and governments push for R&D (research and development) the startup ecosystem can transform the innovation culture and place India on a high growth trajectory.Exits are still an issue in India, when do you see them happening?We believe the Indian start-up ecosystem is quite fragmented and while we have a lot of B2C start-ups, we do require more focus on B2B and on start-ups that are differentiated by IP or deep tech. Start-ups also need to focus on building a scalable business, with an international outlook and catering to standards that make them attractive to large global tech companies or global clients. There is a need for uniqueness and use of deep technology to distinguish from B2C models. We believe for exits to ramp up, there needs to be a concerted approach by all players in the ecosystem and to possibly replicate the success that Israelas one examplehas seen. We do see the government being aligned towards helping start-ups not just grow but also help in their exit process. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Bill 2015, tabled in the Lok Sabha last December, has provisions for fast track and/or voluntary closure of businesses. With the shelf life of Internet-born companies among consumers being low for various reasons like competitive market, too many options, cashback and lucrative benefits, we think its about time that we will witness more exits happening soon. There have been some big exits in the consumer segment with the likes of Myntra, Jabong and Freecharge etc and with more and more international brands venturing into the Indian market the consumer start-up industry will witness further churn and consolidation. We definitely see a huge opportunity for B2B start-ups to grow and be a larger value addition to corporates.Globally, IBM has put capital into venture capital fundsyouve invested in over 50 fundsbut, weve not seen IBM do that in India and south-east Asia. Why is that so?Every start-up has two major requirementsresources and capital. There is no dearth of capital for the right idea and the right team, and there are many investors who are providing this. Where we can differentially add, tremendous value is from giving the much-needed strategic and technology mentorship which further helps the start-up to leverage their money in the right direction. IBM provides access to clients, access to deep technology engagement with our labs and access to mentoring and all of this without the startups giving up any equity for it.In India, you have partnered with Kalaari and Indian Angel Network to work with the start-upsbut this is for mentoring, training and educating and getting them to cloud and cognitive technologies at an early stage. How much leverage do VCs even have in influencing such decisions for their portfolio companies? We are partnering with a select few investors who are actively engaged in supporting and mentoring start-ups in incubating their ideas. At IBM, we believe that we can add value from our deep enterprise technology, our huge spend on research and probably the worlds best access to enterprise clients to help these start-ups and also VCs. We are looking beyond selling our products and solutions to becoming essential to the ecosystem through a whole range of collaborative activitiesincluding helping their portfolio companies get access to IBMs senior leadership team, by jointly working with clients, through activities like design thinking etc with Kalaari and Indian Angel Network.In areas like cloud, start-ups have several competitive optionswhat makes IBM different?IBM has been committed to the overall development of the start-up community and provides startups with free cloud credits on IBM Cloud Solutions worth $24,000 for one year helping emerging companies. We further help them to harness the power of IBM cloud, as well as connect them to IBMs vast global network of clients, consultants, innovation centers, and developers. Several start-ups across India are tapping into IBM cloud to run critical applications and grow their businesses. Both IBM Bluemix, a hybrid cloud development platform and Softlayer, a cloud infrastructure platform, have received a good response in terms of adoption from Indian startups.For start-ups, IBM does not enjoy the mind recall when it comes to looking for potential partners/ How are you working to change that, and given the pace at which IBM operates, can you ever adapt to the requirements, demands, flexibilities that the start-ups require?Indian start-ups have the quality and value to help IBM itself remain agile...so part of this focus is also to help IBMs employeestechnical, sales, business and even functional staff like HR and financelearn and remain abreast with trends. We believe our employees need to stay close to the market and where it is headed and helping in their personal and official capacity to mentor start-ups and help them to innovate. We believe in co-creating and co-innovating with the start-ups and we have an IBM Garage in Bangalore wherein we will have workshops and get start-up get access to a lot of our enterprise customers to build products together.",2016-11-11,SL6pCMJg6ebL1rewMDvayL,"There is a huge opportunity for B2B start-ups to grow, says Nipun Mehrotra, vice-president, growth initiatives, IBM India & south Asia",competitor,11:03,Indian start-ups need to focus more on B2B space: Nipun Mehrotra
-0.49,"It is the Monday after Christmas, and I am meeting Ashish Bhasin, chairman and chief executive officer, Dentsu Aegis Network (DAN), South Asia, for lunch at San-Qi at Mumbais Four Seasons hotel. Arriving a few minutes early, I am reminded of the long boozy lunches the admen were always having in that epochal TV series Mad Men. When Bhasin walks in, a few moments later, it is with the air of easy familiarity. Bhasin has the build of a prosperous Punjabi man and the sartorial style of an adman, in his beige suit and maroon tie.
				   
				The 52-year-old says he is brash; he exults in it. I have announced that the Dentsu Aegis Network wants to be the No.2 player in the country by 2017, says Bhasin, who believes in putting pressure on himself to perform by going public with his objectives. So far, the strategy seems to have worked. In 2008, Bhasin left Lintas to join a bare-bones operation at Aegis India. Eight years later, he presides over DAN with 2,800 employees and revenue of Rs3,500 crore in the year ended December 2016.The last few years have seen Dentsu Aegis on an acquisition spree, buying companies as if they were candy. From digital marketing companies like Webchutney, Communicate 2 and Happy Creative, to public relations firm Perfect Relations and, most lately, user interface and user experience design company Fractal Ink Design Studio, Dentsu Aegis has been on a roll when it comes to the business of buying.If you are not growing, you are dying. Acquisition is something where when you talk to 20 people, four-five may come into the final consideration set. So at any point of time we are talking to four-five people. Its like a courtship, says Bhasin. He says it takes him about a year to complete an acquisition. More than the money, its the chemistry with the management team that matters. I spend a lot of time interacting with the people, across several locations. If they are too full of themselves, you know early on that this guy is never going to be a team player, says Bhasin. He says he has let good businesses go because he felt the promoters were talented but cavalier, like cowboys. Many of Bhasins learnings came from his 20 years in Lintas. When I joined Lintas (in 1988) as a management trainee, I used to be the envy of my peers. I was working on the Liril soap account, and one of our key tasks was to find the new Liril girl. We had to hang around in colleges and had to attend the auditions of bikini-clad models in a bathroom with a shower, he reminiscences.The Lintas days, where Bhasin shot commercials in curfew-struck Burma (now Myanmar), and managed everything from the health of bathrooms to the health of the balance sheet at its Chennai office, make for a fascinating backstory. But a waiter is hovering discreetly in the background. So we break to order lunch. Bhasin is a regular at San-Qi,  and recommends green Thai chicken curry and sautéed prawns, with a side serving of rice. We place the order and move on to trends in media.The whole industry is focusing on ad shots and angles. That is all very important, but guys, the cheese is moving. I dont know why people in advertising are blind, he says. Media is no longer the print and broadcast medium it used to be. The power has shifted to digital. Today people are still spending Rs3 crore to make an ad. But there are digital agencies that make very good ads for Rs30,000 and (they are) getting more views than you are getting on your Rs3 crore ad, says BhasinOur food arrives. The Thai curry is bland in a pleasing way, and the prawns are bathed in a delicate tomato gravy. No onions, Bhasin comments, as the waiter spoons out our individual helpings. That done, we return to the business of media, and to the nuts and bolts of managing a growing organization.Adding employees and acquisitions to DAN has meant that Bhasin has also had to buy or rent real estate. The Bengaluru office recently inaugurated a brand new DAN House building in Koramangala. I am a big believer in co-location; I like to have all my people together, he says, adding that he puts great store by interactions with his employees. There are no walls in my office, there is a glass partition for sound, but everybody can see everything. My email ID is known to everybody and I encourage them to write to me. Some of the best ideas come from the youngest employees, who pick up competitive information as well as knowledge of new trends. The other knowledge source of new trends has always been travel. Ï went to MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology); I went to Tokyo to see the latest advances in AI (artificial intelligence) and robotics. I am constantly keeping myself updated and shaking up my guys. Wake up, this is reality!The constant travel can be trying for his family. Yet Bhasins son Abhinay, 24, likes advertising and would like to make a career in it. His 16-year-old daughter Abhilasha plays squash for India. Wife Mayuri, a classmate from St Xaviers College in Mumbai, worked as a lecturer and then with American Express in Mumbai. Bhasin himself did his bachelors in science (zoology and biochemistry) and then a masters in business administration from Mumbais Sydenham Institute of Management Studies, Research and Entrepreneurship Education.The family likes to travel together, going on cruises, wildlife safaris, or just to their holiday home in Lonavla. There hasnt been a lot of that in the last few years though, for Bhasin hasnt managed to take time off. Its almost 3. Bhasin orders a kulfi and I take a cappuccino. And we continue our conversation.Bhasin is clearly a man on a mission. It burns me when I see any part of a clients business going out, either because they are sharing it with other agencies or because I dont have a service to offer, he says. He is determined to make DAN No.2 in the business, ahead of Interpublic Group and second only to WPP.

0.25,"Mumbai: The board of Indias biggest cigarette maker ITC Ltd will on Friday consider a proposal to split the post of chairman between non-executive chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) in a move that could hand the companys reins to chief operating officer Sanjiv Puri effective 5 February.
				   
				In June last year, ITC said its chairman Y.C. Deveshwar would step down as executive chairman at the end of his term in February, but he would continue as non-executive chairman for at least three more years. Within a month of that announcement, ITC appointed Puri as chief operating officer, giving the first clear indication that he was the front runner to succeed Deveshwar as CEO.After more than two decades at the companys helm, Deveshwar will become a mentor to a new leadership at the diversified conglomerate, which also has interests in hotels and consumer packaged goods, a spokesperson for ITC said on Tuesday.The company said in a regulatory filing that Puri, who became an executive director in December 2015, will take over as CEO if the proposal is approved by the boards nomination and compensation committee.ITCs board will meet on Friday to approve the companys December quarter results. It will be the last board meeting that Deveshwar will chair as CEO of the company. During his term, which started in 1996, he was responsible for the diversification of ITC, which initially focused on cigarettes alone. He is now credited with transforming ITC.The dominant question when he took over was whether to focus (on the core business of cigarettes) or to diversify, said an ITC veteran, who asked not to be identified. The advice was to focus, but Deveshwar as the chairman dealt with the problem differently. He chose to focus as well as diversify by creating an enabling management structure that helped harness skills to do both, this person added.Last year, ITC said that under Deveshwars 20-year leadership, the companys revenue had grown from Rs5,200 crore to Rs51,500 crorealmost a 10-fold jumpwhile generating shareholder returns of 23.3%, compounded annually. Not surprisingly, ITCs board tried to persuade Deveshwar, who is turning 70, to carry on as the chief executive but he decided to put in place a youthful leadership at the helm in the longer term interest.Puri, 54, has been with ITC for more than three decades. An alumnus of Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, he oversaw a large portfolio of businesses starting December 2014. For a year till his elevation to the board as an executive director, Puri was ITCs president (fast-moving consumer goods), overseeing the companys interests in cigarettes, food and personal care products, among other key segments.In an interview with Mint in September last year, Puri said that he would follow Deveshwars footsteps to ramp up revenue from consumer goods other than cigarettes to Rs1 trillion by 2030a target set by his predecessor. This segment, which clocked Rs9,704 crore in revenue in fiscal 2016, presents for ITC the maximum potential to grow, Puri said, indicating plans to take the business abroad after scaling it up locally.",2017-01-24,SVUUtIrntx7OI5z8ExWrMK,ITC  plans to split the post of executive chairman and CEO after Y.C.

0.72,"Since 1 April, the BSE FMCG Indexs gains have been just shy of the broader markets. That should give some clue of how the June quarter has panned out for makers of FMCGshort for fast-moving consumer goods, or packaged consumer goods. While thats nothing to write home about, nobodys expecting anything dramatic to happen. Morgan Stanley has downgraded the sector, saying it will continue to tail the broader market, according to a 24 September report in The Economic Times.
				   
				In the June quarter, many firms reported urban demand continued to be weak and rural growth continued to slow. Hindustan Unilever Ltds domestic consumer business reported a volume growth of 4%, the same as in the March quarter. Pricing pressure continued to be visible in its soaps business, mainly responsible for pulling down value sales growth. Others did not fare too well either. Dabur India Ltds volume growth was 4% against 7% in the March quarter. If volume growth did not impress, pricing pressures meant sales in value terms, too, was under pressure.However, raw material costs continued to be in their favour, as both food and non-food commodity prices remained low. Also, firms cut back on direct advertising, which led to a lower advertising to sales ratio. Instead, they passed on the cost savings in the form of price cuts or volume discounts, in a bid to drive sales growth and protect market share. Lower input costs and the cut in advertising costs meant most firms saw margins improve although the absolute level of profit growth itself was nothing to get excited about. ITC Ltds results were slightly different. Its volume growth improved, probably because the excise duty hikes in the FY17 budget were relatively moderate. Its consumer products business also did well, with sales rising by 9.5%.There are some silver linings. Monsoon rains have been good, which is expected to have a lag effect on rural demand. Among the events that were eagerly awaited, the hike in central government pay has happened and the goods and services tax will be rolled out in FY18. These are all boosters. The only thing thats missing from the mix is a revival in demand for consumer goods.",2016-10-09,Sb9pnv23k4I3M8K5uGqtUO,"Raw material costs continued to be in their favour, as both food and non-food commodity prices remained low",company,23:12,Consumer goods: slow growth remains a bugbear

				The launch of high-speed telecom services by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in September prompted Swedish telecom equipment and network services provider Ericsson AB to fast-track the roll-out of its 4G network.Jios launch definitely accelerated the development of high bit-rate mobile broadband. Without Jio, we wouldnt have seen such a quick roll-out of 4G. It would have happened a little bit more slowly, said Paolo Colella, head for the India region at Ericsson.We have already seen the 4G wave happening in many of the Western countries. In the Far East, China, Korea (and) Japan have already invested heavily in building up infrastructure. Jio has contributed to the acceleration and aligning of India to the rest of the big economies, Colella added.The limited spread of wireline fixed infrastructure in India has led to limited usage of broadband. As the country moves to 4G, there is expected to be massive demand for smartphones.We are anticipating by 2020 we will have at least 800 million smartphones in the market, so the Internet, for Indian people, is mobile. That is a major difference, Colella said.(The other difference is) the industry was not predicting to have Android phones at $40 per unit at the end of 2016, probably expecting it to happen in at least 12 months, if not 18 months further, he added.True Software Scandinavia AB, which makes the Truecaller mobile app to identify incoming calls through a crowd-sourced database, is another Swedish company that has gained from the Jio launch.The number of Truecaller users on the Jio network is already three times that of any other carrier, its co-founder Alan Mamedi said.We see that Reliance Jio right now is three times bigger than other carriers for us, as new users are joining every day. It is not that users from other carriers are droppingthey actually continue to grow. So, the trend we are seeing is that more people get connected for the first time because it is affordable, which is very interesting, Mamedi said.Mamedi added that Reliance Jio will remain a game-changer even after the expiry of free services offer since the tariffs are 10 times cheaper than the competitor.Truecaller, which entered India in 2009, struggled in the initial years as the data market had not developed, and found its feet only after the widespread adoption of 3G and 4G services.Mamedi said as more people use 4G services, it will give tools to smart people to create something magical, driving more start-ups.Home-grown mobile handset manufacturer Lava Mobiles is another company that has gained from the Jio launch. The company hopes widespread 4G adoption will help double its market share to 20% by 2020.In the operator sector, they are doing disruption, but this disruption will increase the operator business also, pushing it to double.

				The government was expected to reduce the cess on crude oil production; but the degree of change has left investors disappointed. Besides, there are other worries. While low crude oil prices result in a lower subsidy burden, analysts point out that related gains are insignificant, compared with the far larger downside from lower prices.Benefits from lower oil subsidy dont exist for ONGC below the crude price of $50 a barrel, say analysts from HDFC Securities Institutional Securities. In fact, it raises concerns about (a) lower profits from joint ventures and ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), and (2) falling domestic gas prices, according to the brokerage firm. A muted price regime will further reduce the chances of an early ramp-up of volumes, which have been flat for nearly a decade, pointed out HDFC Securities in a 2 March report.The budget blow pertained to the cess on crude oil production, which was changed from Rs.4,500 per tonne to a 20% ad valorem rate. The markets were expecting a 10% ad valorem rate. As the chart alongside shows, the benefit isnt noteworthy based on the revised rate.Meanwhile, ONGCs December quarter performance was adversely affected on account of a huge impairment loss.

				According to a person familiar with the development, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the government on 12 October received a favourable order on two issues relating to its share of revenue from the fields.The panel ordered that marketing margin levied by the companies from customers have to be included in the revenue to be shared with the government and that only the actual taxes paid by the contractors can be allowed as a cost and not any notional tax rate mentioned in the contract signed in 1994. In the 1994-95 financial year, corporate tax rate ranged between 45% and 65% depending on tax residence (domestic or foreign) and public interest in the company, compared to 30% at present without surcharge.On a third aspect, the government received mostly a favourable order with an option for companies to file appeals before the tribunal within a month. Based on the two orders that are final with no option for appeals, the oil ministry will calculate the dues and issue notice without waiting any further, said the person. The dues are yet to be calculated.The companies maintained that the order was only partial and that they still have a window to fight the case.Even after the panel decides on every aspect of the dispute, dissatisfied parties are free to approach English courts for further relief.The arbitration was filed by Reliance and British Gas Exploration and Production India Ltd, while ONGC did not participate. BG, the operator of the field, has been taken over by Shell in a deal between the parents Royal Dutch Shell Plc. and BG Group Plc, completed in February.A Reliance spokesperson said, With respect to the arbitration in Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields, the arbitration tribunal has by majority issued a final partial award (FPA), and separately, two dissenting opinions.

The Reliance spokesperson added that the tribunal has scheduled a procedural hearing on 18 and 19 December, where the procedural timetable of the arbitration is likely to be decided. At this point in time, the financial consequences of the findings in the FPA are difficult to ascertain and clarity shall emerge after the tribunal decides upon the liabilities accruing to either parties after further hearings.",2016-10-26,SiOo4yJsye7OykJVwAKl5N,Oil ministry looks to recover revenue share dues from hydrocarbon production at the fields in the Arabian Sea after an arbitration panel ruled mostly in favour of the govt,both,01:16,PMT fields: Govt to serve demand notice to RIL-ONGC-Shell consortium
-0.03,"New Delhi/Singapore: India may turn into a net importer of fuel oil as its state-owned refiners are making multi-billion dollar investments to upgrade their refineries and produce more profitable refined products such as gasoline or diesel.
				   
				India has traditionally been a net exporter of fuel oil, the residue oil left after initial crude refining that is typically used in shipping and power generation. That is about to change. Three state-run energy firms  Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum  plan to spend $20 billion on refinery expansions to add units by 2022 that would process fuel oil into gasoline and diesel, boosting their output to meet growing local demand for transport fuels.Our fuel oil production will be less because everywhere we are going for residue upgrades, said B. Ashok, chairman of the countrys biggest refiner Indian Oil Corp (IOC).Private refiners Reliance Industries and Essar Oil have already invested heavily to build advanced refineries which produce gasoline at the expense of fuel oil.With state refiners now doing the same, India will soon have to sharply raise imports of fuel oil, two traders that participate in the market said. Indias net fuel oil exports averaged 109,000 tonnes from April to September, according to the countrys Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell, and the traders estimate this could flip into a need to raise fuel oil imports as early as late 2017.As a result, the price difference between diesel and fuel oil could narrow further from its current $17.61 a barrel, as Indian shipping fuel demand rises with the governments thrust on the coastal movement of cargoes, considered more cost efficient than road transport.Already, gasoil and fuel oil differentials have started shrinking from about $30 three years ago to $16-$18 now and it is likely to narrow further as refiners are destroying fuel oil to produce gasoil and gasoline, said S. Thangapandian, director at Gulf Petrochem.Indian refiners expansion plans almost coincide with changing shipping fuel norms from 2020 requiring the use of low-sulphur fuels.IOC is the biggest expansion investor, planning to spend Rs50,000 crore ($7.48 billion) by 2022 to raise its refining capacity by about 30% to 2.08 million barrels per day (bpd) including expanding its Panipat refinery in northern India to about 400,000 to 500,000 bpd.HPCL and BPCL plan to spend $11.25 billion to expand refineries and install fuel oil upgrading units, halting fuel oil output in almost all plants.

0.49,"Hong Kong: An Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) deal to cut oil output at a meeting this month is looking increasingly unlikely, with failure warranting prices in the low-$40s, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
				   
				The lack of progress on implementing production quotas and the growing discord between Opec producers suggests a declining probability of reaching a deal on 30 November, Goldman analysts including Damien Courvalin wrote in a note dated 31 October.Opec is due to meet in Vienna to implement the first supply cuts in eight years and get other producers from outside of the group to join in the action, including Russia. Brent crude extended losses below $50 a barrel on Monday after weekend talks failed to yield concrete details on an accord to reduce the global crude surplus and stabilize prices.The lack of an agreement so far has pushed oil prices sharply lower, with weakening oil fundamentals warranting oil prices in the low $40s a barrel in our view if Opec is unable to deliver a convincing agreement, the Goldman analysts wrote.Even if the fear of slumping oil prices prompts the group to hammer out an accord, the probability of the deal successfully reducing inventories is low, the bank said. Rising October Opec production and a faster ramp up of new non-Opec projects have reduced the odds that an agreement translates into a decent draw in inventories during the first half of 2017, it said, estimating average Opec output at about 34.2 million barrels a day last month.While the probability of a cut being announced and the odds of it successfully reducing stockpiles have declined over the past week in Goldmans view, Opecs most senior official said the organization and other major oil producers are on course to deliver a deal that will temper the global oversupply.Committed membersAll of Opecs 14 members as well as erstwhile rivals such as Russia are committed to finalizing the agreement, Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo said on Monday in a Bloomberg Television interview. Even Iraq, which has demanded an exemption from supply caps and vowed to increase production, is willing to play its part, he said.Brent for January settlement was up 30 cents at $48.91 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange at 10:11am in Hong Kong.

In the United States, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $54.19 a barrel, 43 cents above their last settlement. Both contracts were largely flat on the week after days of choppy trading.Theres a lot of volatility, or at least changes in direction, ABN Amro senior energy economist Hans van Cleef said. People think the long-term trend is up, but after a gain of a few dollars, they take profit.Production cuts by Opec kingpin Saudi Arabia and signs that it plans further trims have helped buoy the market.  The Kingdom cut oil output in January by at least 486,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 10.058 million bpd, fully implementing an agreement by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and other producers to curb a global supply glut.State oil giant Saudi Aramco has started talks with customers globally on possible cuts of 3% to 7% in February crude loadings. There are also reports of supply cuts from Abu Dhabi.Still, doubts remained that all producers would fully implement planned reductions. There will be some countries who will cheat...we expect zero compliance from Baghdad... And we definitely do not expect the Kurds to join in, given that they are autonomous from the federal government, Energy Aspects said in its 2017 oil market outlook, published this week.Overall supply from Opec in December fell only slightly to 34.18 million barrels per day (bpd) from a revised 34.38 million bpd in November, according to a Reuters survey this week based on shipping data and information from industry sources.But OPEC was not the only factor; analysts pointed to a strong US dollar, which edged back from a 14-year high this week, and gains in US oil product inventories as holding them in a relatively narrow range.

0.72,"San Francisco: Facebook is updating its trending feature that highlights hot topics on its social networking site, part of its effort to root out the kind of fake news stories that critics contend helped Donald Trump become president.
				   
				With the changes announced Wednesday, Facebooks trending list will consist of topics being covered by several publishers. Before, it focused on subjects drawing the biggest crowds of people sharing or commenting on posts.The switch is intended to make Facebook a more credible source of information by steering hordes of its 1.8 billion users toward topics that reflect real world events being covered by multiple outlets, Will Cathcart, the companys vice president of product management, said in a blog post.Facebook also will stop customizing trending lists to cater to each users personal interests. Instead, everyone located in the same region will see the same trending lists, which currently appear in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and India.That change could widen the scope of information Facebooks users see, instead of just topics that reinforce what they may have already heard or read elsewhere. The broader perspective might reduce the chances of Facebooks users living in a filter bubble  only engaging with people and ideas with which they agree.Facebook introduced its trending list in 2014 in response to the popularity of a similar feature on Twitter, the short-messaging service that competes for peoples attention and advertising revenue.Questions about Facebooks influence on what people are reading intensified last summer after a technology blog relying on an anonymous source reported that human editors routinely suppressed conservative viewpoints on the site.Facebook fired the small group of journalists overseeing its trending items and replaced them with an algorithm that was supposed to be a more neutral judge about what to put on the list.But the automated approach began to pick out posts that were getting the most attention, even if the information in them was bogus. Some of the fake news stories targeted Democratic presidential nominee Hilary Clinton, prompting critics to believe the falsehoods help Donald Trump overcome a large deficit in public opinion polls.Facebook chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg initially brushed off that notion as crazy , but in December the company announced a slew of new measures to curb the spread of fake news.To discourage the creation of fake news in the first place, Facebook also is banishing perpetual publishers of false information from its lucrative ad network.Google, which operates an even larger digital ad network, has taken a similar stand against publishers of fake news.

In its first deal in 2011, Multiples had acquired a significant minority stake in Sara Sae for an undisclosed amount. According to documents filed with the Registrar of Companies (RoC), Multiples held a 46% stake in the company as of 31 March 2016. Multiples had raised its maiden $405 million fund in 2011.Joulon has acquired a controlling stake in Sara Sae through a secondary purchase of Multiples shareholding and an infusion of primary capital.

-0.93,"Investors will require more than one good quarter from GAIL (India) Ltd to alter their view on the stock, partly because the stock has gone up by almost a fourth in the last three months. 
				   
				One reason for this outperformance is the renegotiation of Qatars RasGas liquefied natural gas (LNG) contract announced at the end of December, which is expected to reduce input costs in GAILs petrochemicals business. But with petrochemical prices coming down, one will have to see whether the segments profit improves meaningfully.For the December quarter, the loss before interest and tax for the petrochemicals business dropped to Rs.161 crore from Rs.237 crore seen in the September quarter. The performance could have been better if it were not for stabilization issues faced at the new petrochemicals plant. As Jefferies Equity Research notes, given management commentary that GAIL almost entirely used spot LNG in the third quarter versus mainly RasGas in the second quarter (which was costlier), earnings improvement in petrochemicals was below par.Nevertheless, GAILs overall results did beat expectations. Its gas trading business exceeded expectations, reporting earnings before interest and tax of Rs.483 crore against Rs.51 crore for the year-ago period and Rs.193 crore in the September quarter. Gas pooling for the power sector fetched additional trading volumes sequentially. The companys transmission business too performed well.The upshot: net profit increased 10% year-on-year to Rs.664 crore despite a 10% decline in revenues. Strong other income growth helped.What next? Gas volumes can go up once the increased LNG supplies from RasGas start and once power pooling is implemented in certain states like Andhra Pradesh (still pending due to taxation issues), point out JM Financial analysts.Currently, GAIL trades at 12.5 times estimated earnings for the next fiscal year. Given the rally in the stock over the last three months, most catalysts such as higher crude oil price, positive impact of lower gas price, transmission tariff revision and pickup in transmission volumes seem to be priced in, says Jefferies.",2016-02-11,TOaV2AA7rLEW2O5JR6mVFJ,"Investors will require more than one good quarter from GAIL to alter their view on the stock

Production and offtake growth between April-February was 9.2% and 9.3%, respectively, representing 97% of the targeted level for each. Achieving the full-year target looks difficult. The implied production/offtake year-on-year growth in March is 27%/41%, for the company to achieve its fiscal year 2016 targets. Thats a tall order.CIL shares showed a modest gain after it announced better-than-expected December quarter results. Demand concerns and muted outlook on realizations continue to weigh on the stock. There is hope that power sector demand could improve during the summer season and thus lead to better offtake in the near future. That remains to be seen. Demand from non-power sector (especially the cement industry) though, isnt particularly bright and the situation may persist for some time.Further, doubling of the clean environment cess on coal to Rs.400 a tonne is expected to have an adverse impact. Sure, this increase will be passed on to consumers. But the 3-7% rise in cost of coal-fired electricity generation triggered by doubling the cess arguably reduces the scope (capability and magnitude) for CIL to raise notified prices in fiscal year 2017, say analysts from Nomura Research.Also, the disinvestment overhang could persist. FY17 disinvestment target (excluding strategic sale) is set at a high level againRs.360 billion (Rs.36,000 crore) versus FY16 budget/revised target of Rs.410 billion/Rs.253 billionimplying a lingering equity overhang for Coal India, wrote Nomura analysts in a report on 1 March.

-0.25,"New Delhi: Director general of hydrocarbons Atanu Chakraborty is presiding over the transition to a new regulatory regime for Indias hydrocarbon pursuits aimed at wooing investors with liberal terms when the global oil and gas industry is sailing through a painful phase of low prices. 
				   
				In an interview, Chakraborty said steps will be taken to reduce disputes in the sector and to make the terms for producing unconventional and difficult to extract fuels as investor-friendly as possible. Edited excerpts:Will India be able to cut import dependence on oil and gas by 10% as planned, considering cooking gas consumption and its import is rising?The Ujjwala programme (of distributing LPG without upfront payment to the poor) is part of a shift towards using cleaner fuel and improvement in the quality of life, which is bound to happen. The demand for fuel on account of this has been captured in the consumption growth of fossil fuels. We have to produce that much extra over and above what can be produced on a business as usual scenario. We are looking at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 5.6%. Year on year growth has been almost 11% in 2014-15. The planned 10% reduction in import dependence by 2022 is called for to make us reasonably strategically secure. To achieve that, we need to increase acreage (under exploration and production). We have launched the auction of the discovered small fields this year, after a gap of about six years. In the last two years, fuel price volatility was a reason not to go ahead with the offer of blocks. The blocks currently on offer are relatively small and have many hydrocarbon discoveries so that investors do not have to spend a lot on exploration. There are other incentives too (such as pricing and marketing freedom and duty free import of equipment). The idea is to incentivize investments and to add to overall production. Having more players in the market will increase competition and efficiency in the industry.With global energy firms now cutting back on their investments, the auction of small discovered fields is going to be a test of their appetite for further investments, isnt it?Under the new hydrocarbon exploration licensing policy (HELP), pricing and marketing freedom is given to gas produced from deep-water, high pressure and high temperature areas. Also, the new royalty structure favours investors. Under the revenue share regime, which replaces profit sharing prescribed in the earlier licensing policy, governments share remains the same (as a percentage of revenue), which gives investors the comfort and incentive to produce more and benefit more in absolute terms. With stable policies, robust economic growth and improvement of our ranking in ease of doing business, the country risk for energy firms is very low. We have to leverage it to get investments and then hold their hands to ensure that they get access to market quickly. We have also ensured that they get the processing facilities of ONGC and Oil India Ltd on a commercial basis. There is no gas utilization policy, the entire market for gas is open to producers. People do talk about other incentives in the case of shale gas. Perhaps we will again revisit the regime to see what more can be offered for production of tight oil and shale gas. We need to tap all these resources simultaneously. Increasing productivity and acreage under exploration and getting to difficult reservoirs is broadly the contours of the strategy. Auction of the small discovered field is the first step. The response to the roadshows has been tremendous. As we learn from the process, if we need to tweak our offering, we certainly will do it in a transparent way. Nothing is cast in stone.What is the strategy on unconventional fuels like gas hydrates and shale gas?In the east coast, we are working together with Japan and the US Geological Survey to extract gas from gas hydrates. It is still at a research stage and we have to reach a stage where the molecules are stable. While tight oil and shale gas are within the realm of possibility, gas hydrate has to reach a stage when we can think of commercial production. Considering our reliance on import, we need to be there on all these emerging areas from day one so that we can monetize any upside at the earliest. The gas market in India is rapidly developing with new transmission lines coming up, including for city gas distribution and for fertilizer plants. The share of gas in the national hydrocarbon basket is expected to go up from about 7% now to 25% in some years. In the case of Gujarat, it is already 25%.What are the tax breaks available for gas producers?Income-tax exemption no longer exists for gas, but import of equipment enjoys customs duty exemption.Price volatility in a highly capital intensive and risky sector such as energy, could in no time bankrupt a successful company. Disputes in such a scenario is normal as we have seen in the past. How do you plan to address this?There would be differences in perception, and hence disputes, in big contracts such as those for natural resources. We have to continuously fine tune the resolution mechanisms. We have made many corrections in the production sharing regime and we keep improving the existing system. If the contractor wants to produce hydrocarbons, the government will always help them. Those who are well intentioned, will always do well. We have a large number of fields which have in the last 20 years added to our energy basket. As a regulator, we want every energy company to bring investments and produce more. We will be taking many steps to further improve regulations.What are the specific areas you would be working on to reduce disputes?Communicating right at the time of auctioning the fields, the different aspects of executing the contract and the issues where perceptions could differ between parties, can eliminate avoidable disputes. We keep examining the models elsewhere that could help in reducing the time required for dispute resolution. For example, invoking force majeure provisions in a contract is one area around which many disputes take place. Creating awareness about this among investors is important. A lot of education is required on contract management by the parties. In the road shows for the discovered small fields, we tried to educate businesses about these aspects. We are also thinking of having a portal to facilitate communication among stakeholders that will help in reducing disputes.",2016-10-13,TbkBDUN0P9dE8WGxSKoC0N,"Steps will be taken to reduce disputes in the energy sector, says director general of hydrocarbons Atanu Chakraborty ",both,01:41,The entire gas market is open to producers: Atanu Chakraborty

				Rising oil prices through December encouraged investors to buy large volumes of crude oil futures contracts and many of these long positions are likely to be unwound unless the market stays strong, analysts and brokers say.I see this as a dead cat bounce, said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank in Copenhagen. Oil is unlikely to recover until the longs have been reduced.Tamas Varga, analyst at London broker PVM, agreed. We are seeing some short covering on the back of a weaker dollar, Varga said. We might see stronger prices today after yesterdays big fall, but the market should weaken in coming days. I believe we are going lower.Oil is priced in dollars, so a weaker dollar tends to encourage buying by consumers holding other currencies. Brent crude was up 20 cents a barrel at $55.14 by 3.20pm. US light crude oil was up 25 cents at $52.21.Both crude contracts fell more than $2 a barrel, or around 4%, on Monday on doubts that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and other key oil producers would cut output as promised to try to reduce a global oversupply.Opec members Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi both appear to be reducing production but it is not clear whether other big producers such as Iraq will follow suit. Supplies are also increasing in North America. The average Canadian rig count for December 2016 was 209, up 36 from the 173 counted in November 2016, and up 49 from the 160 counted in December 2015, said Matt Stanley, a fuel broker at Freight Services International in Dubai. A 30% increase in Canadian rigs in a year ... The bear in me is well and truly back, Stanley said.In the United States, energy companies last week added rigs for a 10th week in a row, extending the drilling recovery into an eighth month as crude prices remained at levels at which many US drillers can operate profitably.  Adding one-off supplies, the US Department of Energy on Monday announced a sale for crude from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), with bids for 8 million barrels of light, sweet oil due by 17 January.US SPR sales add to bearish pressures on US crude, Citi said following the release of the bids.

0.5,"Washington: Mobile chip giant Qualcomm was hit on Tuesday with a US antitrust suit alleging it abused its dominant position in the market for processors used in cell phones and other devices.
				   
				The US Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit in federal court in California claiming Qualcomms practices amount to unlawful maintenance of a monopoly in baseband processors, which are devices that enable cellular communications in phones and other products.Qualcomm rejected the agencys case as significantly flawed, arguing that reasoning at the heart of the civil complaint is wrong.In our recent discussions with the FTC, it became apparent that it still lacked basic information about the industry and was instead relying on inaccurate information and presumptions, Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg said in a released statement.Qualcomm, which is the dominant provider of chips for smartphones, has faced similar antitrust investigations in the European Union and China, and last month was hit with a record fine of $850 million by South Korean enforcement regulators.ALSO READ: Samsung succession in disarray as Jay Y. Lee criminal case advancesIn the US lawsuit, the FTC said Qualcomms policy is to supply its processors only on the condition that cell phone manufacturers agree to Qualcomms preferred license terms for patents which are essential for mobile communications.By using its monopoly power to obtain elevated royalties that apply to baseband processors supplied by its competitors, Qualcomm in effect collects a tax on cell phone manufacturers when they use non-Qualcomm processors, the lawsuit said.This tax weakens Qualcomms competitors, including by reducing demand for their processors, and serves to maintain Qualcomms monopoly in baseband processor markets. Qualcomms actions have hurt competitors including Taiwan-based Via Technologies, which was acquired by Intel in 2015, and another Taiwan firm, MediaTek Inc.The suit also alleges that Qualcomm extracted exclusivity from Apple in exchange for reduced patent royalties, which prevented the iPhone maker from getting processors from Qualcomms competitors from 2011 to 2016.Qualcomm general counsel Rosenberg maintained that the FTC sped up the investigation, filing the suit just days before a change in the US presidential administration and with only three of five agency commissioners in place.This is an extremely disappointing decision to rush to file a complaint, Rosenberg said. It became apparent that the FTC was driving to file a complaint before the transition to the new administration.The San Diego, California, group in 2015 agreed to pay $975 million to settle antitrust charges in China.

-0.6,"Shares of NTPC Ltd hit a new 52-week high on Friday before closing lower. 
				   
				They had surged on Thursday after the company said it signed a non-binding agreement to buy stage-I and II of the Chhabra thermal power plant from the Rajasthan government.Stage I constitutes a 1,000-megawatt (MW) operating plant, while Stage II has 1,320MW under construction.Apart from capacities, NTPC did not divulge details such as price or valuation.Still, the acquisition makes sense, not least because of the diminishing growth opportunities in conventional energy.According to analysts, the Chhabra plant has power purchasing agreements with Rajasthan distribution companies on a cost-plus tariff.This is crucial, considering that there is a paucity of long-term power-purchasing agreements in India right now.Many companies are struggling to find customers.So, the acquisition of such a large regulated capacity will augur well for NTPC. Regulated capacities ensure minimum returns, limiting downside risks.But such opportunities come at a price, and there is no clarity on this.According to Nomura Research, the Rajasthan utilitys annual report pegged the 1,000MW plants project cost at Rs5,850 crore. Against this, the regulator is said to have approved a project cost of Rs5,010 crore. So, it would be a good deal if NTPC buys the plant at around book value or not more than Rs6 crore per MW, Nomura reasons.To compare with deals of similar size, last year, JSW Energy Ltd agreed to pay Rs6.5 crore per MW for a 1,000-MW plant if the seller secures fuel supplies and the buyer of electricity.Nomura expects its earnings estimates for NTPC to rise marginally for the next two fiscal years, if the plant generates the stipulated return on equity.But these estimates are not watertight. An analyst at another broking firm points out that it all depends on the kind of value addition NTPC does to the plant.As can be seen in the accompanying chart, the Chhabra plant has shown inconsistent performance.The utilization levels have not been consistent and lagged NTPCs levels.Given the companys expertise, analysts expect NTPC to improve efficiency, extracting better return ratios. NTPC said as much in its statement.The optimism is partly reflected in the share price. The stock has gained 19% in the past year on steady earnings and guided for strong capacity addition-led growth.Though valuations at around 1.4 times one-year-forward price-to-book value are not expensive, a timely commissioning of projects under construction and proof that NTPC is extracting the intended benefits from the Chhabra plant will add to investor confidence.In our view, improved visibility of captive coal access and a potential 33% capacity rise in the next three years will finally boost earnings growth and return on equity, Nomura adds.",2017-01-16,TmisKpIQScwFp3rsKYRxwO,A timely commissioning of projects under construction and proof that NTPC is extracting the intended benefits from the Chhabra plant will add to investor confidence,competitor,07:51,What will make the Rajasthan acquisition tick for NTPC?
-0.47,"Mumbai: Going by the slew of measures announced in the Union budget on Wednesday, such as targeting digital transformation while discouraging cash transactions, its easy to be lulled into believing that India is well on its way to becoming a digital powerhouse.
				   
				And why not? After all, finance minister Arun Jaitley did unveil a series of post-demonetisation digital reforms, including a Rs3 lakh cap on cash transactions, which he said were aimed at fetching the government Rs2,500 crore in revenue. While the initiatives to build a digital India are undoubtedly important, we cannot ignore the fact that India has a long way to go becoming digital. Here are a few reasons:For one, India still ranks a poor 91 on the Networked Readiness Index (NRI) 2016a key component of the World Economic Forums The Global Information Technology Report 2016. The report assesses the state of networked readiness of 139 economies using the NRI and examines the role of information and communication technologies (ICT) in driving innovation. It is thus a key tool in assessing a countrys preparedness to reap the benefits of emerging technologies and capitalize on the opportunities presented by the digital transformation.Also read: Budget 2017: Arun Jaitley unveils series of post-demonetisation digital reformsThe 2016 edition of the NRI placed Singapore at the top of the list of countries when it comes to networked readiness. Finland, which topped the ranking in 2014, came second for the second year in a row, followed by Sweden, Norway and the US, which climbed two places. The remaining top 10 comprised the Netherlands, Switzerland, the UK, Luxembourg and Japan. Networked readiness, therefore, is correlated to per-capita income.Not only was India ranked 91 among 138 countries in 2016, but WEFs figures also showed that India had actually fallen 23 places in the NRI ranking in the last four years. In 2013, when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government was in power, India was ranked 68 on the index out of 144 countries. When the Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government took over in May 2014, the ranking slipped to 83 out of 148 countries. In 2015, Indias ranking fell to 89 out of 143 countries. And in 2016, it slipped two places to 91 out of 138 countries.While Indias absolute score has changed only marginally in recent years, other countries are racing ahead at faster speeds. Lack of infrastructure and low levels of skills among the population remain the key bottlenecks to widespread ICT adoption, especially in terms of individual usageissues that governments have attempted to address over the last 10 years.Also read: Union Budget 2017: The winners and losersAs the WEF report pointed out in its 2016 edition, a deep divide persists between well-connected metropolitan hubs and remote rural areas, which lack even the most basic infrastructure. This implies that BharatNets implementation track record needs to significantly improve for the benefits to reach rural India.Second, Indias spirited talk about becoming a cashless economy happened when the Indian government invalidated high-value banknotes on the night of 8 November, taking out 86% of the currency in circulation by value. It was supposed to be a war on unaccounted and untaxed wealth, counterfeit notes and terror financing. Instead, as serpentine queues formed outside bank branches and automated teller machines (ATMs) went dry for days and weeks together, the slogan changed. It became all about promoting a cashless or at least a less-cash culture in an economy where almost 90% of transactions are paid for in cash. Indians can boast about technologies such as mobile wallets, crypto-currencies such as bitcoin, mobile peer-to-peer payments, blockchain technology, payment banks and architecture such as the unified payments interface (UPI) and the recently-launched Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) app.  But the government is yet to devise a police on online security. The Indian IT Act (2008) alone will not suffice.Third, Digital Indias Rs1.3 trillion programmewhich envisages a plethora of e-governance services across sectors like healthcare, education and banking, and promises to introduce transparency in the system, reduce corruption and achieve inclusive growthwas only given the green light in 2015. And while the Modi government was simply building on the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) that was approved in 2006 under the previous government, it is obvious that digital programmes do not bear fruit overnight.Also read: Budget 2017: A minimalist approach for an evolving IndiaSmart cities are a case in point. It takes 30-40 years to build a city. Programs like Smart Cities and Make in India will require considerable investments in terms of manpower, technological upgrades, skill development, digital literacy and, most importantly, a plethora of standards to be laid out and adhered to. The Internet of Things (IoT) which entails hundreds of thousands of sensors will need interoperability of standards and security policies in place so that our smart devices, smart homes, smart grids and smart cities are not paralysed by smart cybercriminals.Fourth, while one can see tangibles like the governments Digital Locker and other e-services ride on a robust GI Cloud, also known as Meghraj, Internet speeds are poor in India despite the spread of fourth generation (4G) technology. Mobile calls still drop routinely in Digital India. Not to mention that many people in villages still do not have an Internet connection or enough local language content.Fifth is the power of online education. In a bid to bridge the digital divide through online education, Jaitley on Wednesday also announced that the governments Swayam platform, which has been developed by the ministry of human resource development and All India Council for Technical Education with the help of Microsoft Corp., will start offering 350 online courses. Swayam would be ultimately capable of hosting 2,000 courses and 80,000 hours of learning, covering school, under-graduate, post-graduate, engineering, law and other professional courses, according to its website.While online courses are definitely the need of the hour, they again will be dependent on high-speed broadband connectivity, a digital mindset, and more importantly, government recognition for online course certificates without which there will be few takers.India is at the cusp of a massive digital transformation, said Jaitley as he listed digital as one of the 10 key themes in Union Budget 2017.

-0.42,"In late October, Silicon Valley venture capitalist Bill Gurley, speaking to The Wall Street Journal about technology start-up valuations, said, All these private valuations are fake. Theyre all on paper.
				   
				Gurley, managing partner at San Francisco-based venture capital firm Benchmark, has been openly critical for a while of the dizzying valuations attributed to technology start-ups in recent years. His criticism is directed in particular at unicorns, the common term for technology start-ups privately valued at $1 billion or more.Until a couple of months ago, Gurleys criticism had few takers in Indias start-up ecosystem. In fact, back in October, few venture capitalists and even fewer entrepreneurs would concede to a valuation bubble.Sure, there had been a few upsets. Zomato, the restaurant discovery platform backed by Info Edge India Ltd and Sequoia Capital, had fired 10% of its staff as part of a cost rationalization drive. Food ordering start-up TinyOwl, backed by Matrix Partners and Sequoia, had laid off more than 100 people and shut down offices in some cities as it battled a cash crunch. Property search and listings platform Commonfloor was on the block as it failed to draw fresh capital despite having investors such as Tiger Global Management and Google Capital on board.But, unlike elsewhere in the world, where unicorn valuations were being marked down with alarming frequency by mutual funds, Indias unicorns held their mythical valuations. E-commerce bellwether Flipkart was still going strong at $15.2 billion. Rival Snapdeal was cruising along at about $5 billion. Budget stays aggregator and unicorn aspirant OYO Rooms had just snapped up $100 million from Japanese investor SoftBank and others, taking its valuation to a reported $400 million. Even seed-stage start-ups were raking in $1 million rounds. What bubble?In the past two months, however, some of that exuberance has tempered. People still arent talking in bubble terms, but they admit that a correction is underway in Indias start-up funding market. The correction is evident from the numbers for the concluding quarter of 2015. A KPMG report, based on data compiled by research firm CB Insights, shows that venture capital-backed firms in India raised $1.5 billion in October-December 2015, down 46% from the $2.8 billion raised in the July-September quarter. The volume of deals also declined to 114 from 139 in the preceding quarter.The numbers are down primarily because of a correction in later funding rounds, specifically in the Series B and C stages where valuations were most frothy. A quick survey of deals reported across media shows that after September, there has been a marked decline in Series B and C stage deals, especially in terms of value. Compared with the past, only one deal crossed the $100 million markhyperlocal delivery service Grofers raised $120 million in a Series B round led by SoftBank. The ticket sizes of the remaining 15 deals in those stages were well below the $50 million mark. After Grofers, the three largest deals involved e-commerce company Naaptol ($52 million), PepperTap, another hyperlocal delivery service ($40 million), and ethnic products marketplace Craftsvilla ($34 million).Apart from the decline in deal ticket sizes, later-stage rounds are also in a somewhat different complexion in terms of the investors involved. Out of the 16 deals reported, six were led by strategic investors such as SoftBank, Paytm, Snapdeal, Amazon, Mitsui, and even a local family office backed by the Murugappa Group. Venture capital firms have been less visible, preferring to divert their resources to younger companies at the seed and Series A stages. Not because their resources are running scarceIndia-dedicated venture capital funds raised a little more than $2 billion in fresh capital last year, according to data compiled by the Emerging Markets Private Equity Association.Most venture capitalists believe that valuations will correct further. In January, Mint reported that practically every leading venture capital fund in the market expects valuations for mid-stage deals to be between 25% and 50% lower than the 2015 levels. That, most reckon, will take another 6-8 months to play out, and theyre willing to wait. They can afford to wait because hedge funds, notably New York-based Tiger Global (which invests in start-ups from a separate venture capital fund), are no longer breathing down their necks. Hedge funds, until recently among the most aggressive dealmakers in Indias start-up market, are on a hiatus due to the recent turmoil in the public markets.While venture capitalists have started to come to terms with the downturn, entrepreneurs are still holding out. This isnt unusual. Historically, private valuations have always lagged the public markets by a few months. But, theres no doubt that they will eventually correct. Entrepreneurs can take cues from the recent markdown of the value of Flipkart shares owned by mutual funds. The latest to do so is Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund Trust, which has written down the value of its minor stake to $58.9 million, as of 31 December, from $80.6 million in June.The Morgan Stanley markdown brings Flipkarts valuation down to about $11 billion from the $15.2 billion the company claimed when it raised its last round of funds. Thats a fairly big hit, assuming that the lofty valuations that Flipkart claims arent, as Gurley suggests, imaginary.Flipkart is a bit of a lodestar for the countrys start-up ecosystem. That makes the markdown the strongest manifestation yet of the correction that is currently underway in Indias start-up funding market.Winter is here. Make no mistake. But, as anybody whos lived through a couple of downturns would know, its also when the most interesting start-ups are born.Snigdha Sengupta is the founder of StartupCentral, a digital news and analytics platform focused on venture capital.

				On Monday night, Cyrus Mistryunceremoniously dumped as group chairman two months agoended his high-decibel bid to hang around at operating companies that had called shareholder meetings to oust him.But Mistrys resignation from those boards is perhaps only a recognition that he was going to lose the proxy fight. Ratan Tata, who engineered the coup against Mistry at holding company Tata Sons Ltd, wont be resting easy. The founding familys tenuous control of the $103 billion conglomerate cant be taken for granted.With Mistry promising to shift the battleground, a far messier skirmish lies ahead. The risk is no longer of a split in the empire; now, just by being patient and uncompromising, Mistry could in theory get all of it.The ousted chairman says he will take the fight to a platform that can uphold the rule of law. Courts, however, are unlikely to get involved in deciding whether Ratan Tata kept meddling in the operating companies after handing over the reins four years ago.Also read: The options before Cyrus MistrySimilarly, Mistrys insinuations of insider trading might baffle the securities regulator. It would be one thing to show that trustees of Tata Trusts, philanthropic institutions that control two-thirds of Tata Sons, asked and got unpublished, price-sensitive information about publicly listed units, but quite another to prove that any of them enriched themselves or others.Alleged financial fraud and violation of foreign-exchange laws at Tata Groups joint-venture airline with Malaysias AirAsia Bhd might pose a more serious challenge, and even ethical lapses that arent necessarily crimes would serve their purpose. If the fog is thick enough to keep the conglomerate on front pages of newspapers for all the wrong reasons, an irritated government might be forced to intervene in Tata Trusts on the grounds that they have gone astray from their charitable mission.Assume Ratan Tata is no longer able to control Tata Trusts. Then, as the second-largest investor in Tata SonsMistrys family owns more than 18%the deposed leader gets to shape the groups destiny.It wont be that easy. If Ratan Tata, whos back as interim chairman of the holding company, can quickly find a strong successor to look after the empire, he can regain his footing. That would allow him to broach a compromise from a position of strength. Theres already a proposal to list Tata Sons. Citigroup Inc. drew up a detailed plan some time back. Implementing it would unlock value for Mistrys shareholding, too.Whether the deal works depends on Mistrys risk preference: The longer he drags on the conflict, the more the loss of wealth for all shareholders, including himself. But Mistry, 48, has one advantage over his 78-year-old-adversary: time.The onus to settle the feud is on Ratan Tata, and the younger man must know that, too.

-0.25,"London: Some of the worlds biggest oil companies will invest $1 billion over the next 10 years to develop technologies to capture and store emissions of greenhouse gases and improve energy efficiency.
				   
				The investment, announced in a joint statement on Friday from companies including Saudi Arabian Oil Co., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA, BP Plc, Eni SpA, Statoil ASA and Repsol SA, aims to deploy low-carbon technologies on a large scale. Those energy producers, which together plan more than $90 billion of capital expenditure this year, are part of the oil and gas climate initiative, which is seeking ways the industry can support a global deal to tackle climate change while continuing to produce their hydrocarbon reserves.The creation of OGCI climate investments shows our collective determination to deliver technology on a large scale that will create a step change to help tackle the climate challenge, according to the statement. By working with others our companies play a key role in reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases.The investment comes as last years Paris climate accord enters into force, and three days before delegates from almost 200 countries gather in Marrakesh, Morocco for the latest round of talks to flesh out the deal. The companies, which together account for about a fifth of the worlds oil and gas output, last year backed policies consistent with limiting the increase in average global temperatures to within 2 degrees celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).Not enoughWe have got to welcome any positive move like this particularly, from the oil and gas industry, said Anthony Hobley, chief executive officer of the Carbon Tracker Initiative, a London-based group that studies the effects of climate change and policy on capital markets. $1 billion is not enough and it should be spent on clean energy and not squandered on carbon capture, he said.To give the world a 50% chance of limiting the temperature increase to below 2 degrees Celsius, about one third of oil reserves, half of natural gas and 80 of coal must remain unburnt, according to the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, a London-based researcher.The world needs to focus on ways to capture greenhouse gas emissions, not think about keeping oil in the ground, former Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali Al-Naimi said at an event in London Friday. Theres absolutely nothing wrong with fossil fuels and since the Paris climate agreement the kingdom, which has about 260 billion barrels of oil reserves, is focusing on ways to capture emissions, he said.Carbon captureThe OGCI said it has identified two initial focus areas: accelerating the deployment of carbon capture and storage and reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, which also warm the planet.The group, which was formed in 2014, also includes China National Petroleum Corp., Petroleos Mexicanos and Indias Reliance Industries Ltd. They have reduced greenhouse gas emissions from their own operations by 20% since 2005, according to the initiatives website. No US-based companies are part of the group.Even after the Paris climate deal agreed last year, the world still remains on track for as much as 3.4 degrees of warming by the end of the decade, according to the United Nations. Countries must make further pledges to cut at least 12 gigatons of carbon dioxide in order to meet the Paris goals, it said in a report on Thursday.

				After a series of allegations over issues related to points of interconnection, predatory pricing and Internet usage charge, there seems to be a truce between Airtel and Jio.ALSO READ | Reliance Jio is here to stay: Airtel CEOIn an interview, Airtel chief executive Gopal Vittal said Jios entry strategy is good and bold and that the firm is here to stay. Vittal, however, said Airtel will continue to bank upon its spectrum assets, brand, network expansion and capital expenditure. Edited excerpts:How do you look at your operations in the wake of Jios entry?We still feel there is an opportunity in the rural areas and we are going deeper there to drive penetration. We believe managing price volume trade-off to maximize Arpu (average revenue per user) is very important. Driving penetration of data is a very important piece; we have seen a slowdown in last six months. We have put in a bunch of initiatives in the last three months and we see some early signs of success.ALSO READ | Airtel to combat Reliance Jio on price, bundling and cost front: CEO Gopal VittalThe metric we chase is our revenue market share (RMS) because we believe that RMS is the only metric that determines if customers are giving you a higher share of their wallets. And in the last one year, the highest increase we have seen is an almost 1.5% growth in market share and the incremental revenue that is generated in a year, we got about 50% of that last year.The long answer to your short question is, its not about the next three or six months, it is really about continuing to drive this passionately because we have seen competitors come and go. I mean in the last 10 years, its been a brutally competitive industry. There used to be 13 players and many players were operating at half the pricing of what we are operating at. We have had bumps, ups and downs on the road, it is not that every year has been great. We have had years where we have actually lost market share and then we had to come back. And consequence of losing market share is that you lose everything, revenue and margin, you lose it all. So this is a metric which is very important to us to make sure we are competitive.Why is the slowdown in data happening?I think the barriers to it are many, one is the price of the devicethe difference between a Rs3,000-3,500 phone which is the cheapest device for data and lets say a Rs1,000 device which is a feature phone is still a big deal for many customers. Second is that a lot of customers dont know what to do with the Internet; even if they need it, they dont know how to use it. The other part is that they have a perception that its expensive and there is a perception of value that you need to create. So, its a combination of all of these things. Amongst women, its much lower than men, penetration rate is substantially low even in urban areas, let alone in rural.So, contrary to the perception that Jios entry will boost data consumption, it hasnt really?I think there is a difference between penetration and consumption. Consumption will continue to grow. As pricing comes down, people use a lot. I think in the long term, penetration will grow, there is no question about it. I am just saying that this is an important piece that we should acknowledge, do a bunch of things to actually shape it.  Do you think what Jio is doing is sustainable?I think it is sustainable. Ultimately, its got linked to revenue. To that extent, they have chosen to play in a certain way, which is good and bold. Hopefully, it works for them.But the strategy that they have come out with, has the industry seen similar strategies before?Firstly, you have not seen that. You have seen one of the players who operates in six circles, who operates in voice pricing, which is 50-60% lower, which is Telenor. There again, they have bundles. At certain price points (for voice), speak as much as you want. That we have seen. They also have very simple tariff plans, which has worked for them, but they have come under some pressure in terms of whats happening in the context of the industry. How will you assess the impact of Jio? I would say they are certainly going to stay. You would see consolidation in the market. Even today, you have eight players; and in the next three years, you may see four players. Thats a good thing.From our position, it would come back to whether we have spectrum assets, capex and financial wherewithal to invest in the network and the answer to that is, yes.How do you see the data and voice play turning out in the coming quarters? We have seen erosion in both voice as well as data. Data has been more secular. It has been growing year on year. I think the data tariff erosion is okay as long as we get data-driven revenue growth. What we have seen most recently is revenue growth softening. Part of that is on account of free services because there are people who want to try it for free.On voice, we have seen elasticity. We have seen strong growth on volumes and erosion on tariff for us. Voice revenue growth has been pretty good. Last quarter we had 9-10% growth, which is reasonably good. We will see some softening of this growth because of free services being offered and some point when they get priced in, we will come back and look at how do we respond to that.Which of the twodata or voicewill have more growth?In India, the average use of minutes is 415 or 420. It is among the highest in the world. The only market which is higher is the US because you have voice free in all their plans. But the pricing starts $40-$50. So, there it is 50% higher. There is a finite limit to how much I want to speak to the other person. That will see more secular growth. On data, sky is the limit because you can do everything through the Internet. Do you see a point where voice can be made completely free like you said about the US?I think there will be a duality to the market. Voice will be free when someone is paying for the data. If everything is free, then we are not having this conversation. But if you are making something free, then you have to charge something else. So, the key question that comes out is, how much Arpu do you get? I think there will be a set of customers who will demand that through bundles. So, that will happen. Will that happen all across the market? I dont think so. I think there will still be some amount of duality in the market.So, you do not see a tipping point for making voice free?Even today, we are doing it. The 1599 price has come down to 999. At 999, voice is free with a bundle of data. But, people are paying for the package. Whether I am paying for voice or data, it does not really matter. I am paying for the aggregate. If that numbers comes down then the question is for competing whats the price you want to compete at? Thats a stroke of the pen decision. This market is complex and nuanced enough that you cant do a call and odd approach. It is not this or that. You have to play together because the scale that we have, the number of customers we serve, we will have to play them together. This is true for the industry: 20% of customers give you 50-60% of your revenue. This is true for all categories. Does that mean that 40-50% of the revenue is not important? No. It is absolutely important but we will have to find the right cost to serve them. So, thats where the and comes in. You have to do both. For a new entrant, it is easier because you will say I will only operate like this. In the context of planned investments by Jio and Vodafone, how do you look to fund your expansion? We generate close to Rs. 15,000-16,000  crore of cash on an annual basis. Our net debt to EBITDA is 2.2, which is very comfortable and very competitive with the best run telcos around the world. So whether you look at it from the spectrum perspective, or rolling out capex a year and half in advance, or brand in terms of who owns 4G today, or best broadband experience or whether its our customer base of 260 million, in all respects we are in a solid position. But from a financial position, the fact is that this industry is in deep debt and the return on capital of the entire industry is less than 1%, which is really low. Even for us as a leading player, we earn just 8% which is no different than a fixed deposit. So that is the function of the humongous cost of spectrum that we have purchased and some of that was a function of what happened in 2014, where we did the renewals. Where we were actually forced to buy, there was not enough spectrum and so if we didnt buy we would be forced out of business and we may have overpaid because of the design of that auction. What is your road map on cutting down the debt? We have just announced a process with a proposed significant stake sale of Infratel. A committee of directors has been appointed, they will look into it, study it and look at all the options on the table for the board. Beyond that I cannot comment right now.",2016-11-02,UBHj5LZi5HeOpQepV8xx4I,"Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal in an interview says the telecom firm will continue to bank upon its spectrum assets, brand, network expansion, capex",both,01:31,"Airtel planning rural expansion, in wake of Jio entry: CEO Gopal Vittal"
-0.26,"Over the last fortnight, capital goods giant Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (Bhel) has been in the news as it has commissioned several thermal units. For the year ended 31 March 2016, the firm also boasts the highest number of projects commissioned in the last five years. Whats more, it has an order book that is four times its trailing annual revenue. Simply put, it means that Bhels Rs.1.1 trillion order book is enough to generate revenue for the next four years.
				   
				But all this has mattered little to investors. In the past year, the companys stock is down by over 50%. Why?Nearly half of Bhels orders are from the power sector, where projects are stranded for want of clearances. Obviously, projects are moving at a slow pace, leading to cost overruns.On the industrial side, too, clients are in no hurry to get projects off the ground. Recent macroeconomic data echoes the same. Manufacturing activity in the country is down and gross fixed capital formation during the March quarter contracted from a year ago by 1.9%, making it the lowest in two years.Besides, analysts concede that most of the recent orders were at low margins because of the stiff competition in the industry. All these factors mean that there will be challenges to revenue and profit traction.The companys March quarter performance bears testimony to this. Revenue declined by 22% year-on-year and operating margin at 3.6% was way below 7% that the Street had forecast. The management too appears worried about such projects. The quarters profit was below expectation partly due to provisions made towards doubtful debts and liquidated damages.Thats not all. The next three years may be challenging for order inflows too. Data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy paints a rather gloomy picture for power equipment manufacturers. The annual plant load factor for Indias thermal and nuclear power stations is down from 78% in fiscal year 2008 to about 62% in FY16. Whats worse is that the peak energy deficit is also dropping, indicating that there is no demand for power. These circumstances undermine the need for more power capacity. According to a note by Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd, Bhel accounts for about two-thirds of the industrys power equipment capacity of 30 GW (gigawatts), whereas order inflows over the next two to three years, is unlikely to cross 12-15 GW. This implies stiff competition and weak pricing power, impairing profit margins.Given these challenges, it is not surprising that a huge order backlog and a steep 55% jump in order inflows, even in the recent March quarter, failed to cheer investors and power the stock. Macro challenges are likely to tell on Bhels profitability and are too steep to tide over in the near term.",2016-06-17,UBdHphJekVbJ3r5NQvAYJO,"In spite of an order book of Rs1.1 trillion, analysts see challenges to Bhels revenue and profit traction

				Even as bank investors cheered, the transaction with a group led by Russias Rosneft PJSC points to the fact that the Indian banking system still has to depend on sale of assets by debtors to achieve true resolution of soured loans.The operating company debt, which includes (that of) Essar Oil, Vadinar Port and Vadinar Power, where the total debt is about $5 billion, will become part of this transaction. This would be a shade over 50% of the operating companys term debt. In addition to this, another $5 billion debt of holding company will also be deleveraged, said Prashant Ruia, director, Essar Group. He didnt reveal the total debt of the group, which brokerages such as Kotak Institutional Equities estimate at Rs1.3 trillion. The deal value of $13 billion is the enterprise value of the assets being sold. The remaining proceeds from the deal will be used to restructure the debt of Essar Steel, settle some of the working capital debt and some will go to the promoters, said Ruia.While we are yet to sit down and discuss this in detail with the Essar Group promoters, the expectation is that some parts will come to the steel company too, a senior official at a large state-owned bank said on condition of anonymity.According to Ruia, the promoters are open to investing further equity in the groups steel company if the restructuring proposal requires them to do so. Prospects at Essar Steel are looking up. We are functioning at about 70% capacity. The project is already completed. We will reach close to full capacity in two quarters, said Ruia. Whatever were the problems of the past, (they) have now been overcome. Essar Steel will soon become the crown jewel of the group, just like Essar Oil was.Most lenders in Essar Steel have classified the Rs40,000-crore account as a non-performing asset, with some such as ICICI Bank Ltd, HDFC Bank Ltd, Federal Bank and Axis Bank Ltd selling either part or all of their exposure to Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Co. Ltd.I will not talk of company-specific future-looking statements, but I would say that possibilities of resolution only increase as the industry does better and as promoters are able to bring in part of their equity, ICICI Bank managing director and CEO Chanda Kochhar told CNBC-TV18.ALSO SEE | Why has Rosneft paid a packet for Essar Oil?ICICI Bank shares gained the most, 6.91%, among Essar lenders as investors cheered news that part of the funds from the oil deal would be used to clear pending bank liabilities.

-0.04,"New Delhi: Over the last two decades Naukri.com, has emerged as a leading name in the job matching space in India. In an interview, Hitesh Oberoi, chief executive of Naukri and its holding company Info Edge (India) Ltd, talks about how Naukri has grown as a business and Indias changing jobs scenario. He also speaks about how Info Edge is growing from being the holding company for a hiring firm into an investor role and if it would invest further in Zomato. If we see an opportunity to acquire a company and own 100% in it, we will do (it), Oberoi says. Edited excerpts:
As a leading jobs match maker, how do you see the jobs space shaping up in India?What weve seen for the last two years is growth reviving but it is not secular  not across sectors. Growth for the last six to eight quarters has been driven largely by IT sectors, Internet services, e-commerce. Now, we see banking and financial services also picking up, pharma has also been strong. Services have been doing okay. We are worried about a slowdown in IT, and IT companies are talking about it.How has Naukri changed as a businessfrom one dot com boom to another?When we got funded in 2000, after two years of our existence, there were only two million Internet users in the country. Nobody even understood how the Internet could be used for hiring. So what we did in the first few years was to educate, acquire and train customers on how to use Naukri for hiring. In the last few years, Internet has become mainstream. Some 350-400 million people are online. Smartphones are omnipresent. Companies now hire more than 50% via online. They must be using Naukri, other job boards, their own websites, a referral hiring programme, social media, etc.We have seen a massive shift from print hiring 15 years ago to bulk hiring through online. And this will only accelerate. We are trying hard to enable e-hiring for companies. Naukri is offering a career site management service where we power company career sites through our software.Is the career site management service helping to diversify your portfolio?We saw this coming a few years ago. We have 65,000 corporate customersfirms big and small. We realized that they still dont hire completely from Naukri. They still want to use their career websites, referral hiring programmes. So, we started diversifying to these areas. We now have a referral hiring manager and have facilities which help companies run their referral hiring programme through a portal. We see this as an opportunity for us to develop new revenue streams over time. Today, single digits in percentage terms of revenue comes from these products but it could become substantial in the coming 4-5 years. Naukri is a Rs500 crore business, and even 5% of that is a significant number...(it) can become double digit in five years.Earlier, Naukri was the flagship brand, but now Info Edge is becoming a venture capital kind of play with several investments. Is Info Edge growing as an investor rather than a hiring company?Naukri is still maybe 70% of our revenue, but there are other operating businesses which are now growing rapidly and are becoming bigger. For example, 99 acres did about Rs115 crore revenue last year and is growing at a faster rate than Naukri. Jeevansathi has turned profitable. Shiksha business is also breaking even. These three businesses, on a quarterly basis are generating a revenue of about Rs55-60 crore for us, bigger than most of the Internet companies out there. So, we are fairly bullish that going forward these businesses will become big.And this does not include Zomato. Outside, we have invested in 10 or 12 companies, and some of these will also do very well. We see ourselves as an operating company. We have these three-four verticals in the company...they bring us cash and enable us to invest outside. Hopefully the outside investments will become large and increase our overall top line.I would not say that we are a VC player, but yet if there is a good opportunity, we dont mind investing outside. But we dont have a fund like any other VC would have...We look at opportunity, if we see more opportunity in the internal business, well invest there and similarly for outside. If we see an opportunity to acquire a company and own 100% in it, we will do (it).You have invested around Rs860 crore, do we see this growing by certain percentage over next three years?For example, we own 50% of Zomato and thats a lot. We dont go by targets, we go by opportunities. If we see an opportunity, we dont mind whether it is inside the company or whether it is an acquisition opportunity or an investment.Yes we have some basic rules, like we dont like to invest in non-Internet businesses, we try and invest mostly in India-focused business, restrict ourselves to the consumer Internet space, we like businesses inside our market places. These are the broad guidelines which we follow while investing, but we are open. So Naukri may become much less than 60-70% of the business?If it happens because other businesses are growing then its fine, but if Naukri is not growing then thats a problem. We actually see a lot of opportunity in the job business, because we are very diversified and working on different things. And who knows if GDP growth picks up-for every 1% GDP growth, our business (Naukri) grows 8-10%.  You spoke about Zomato, are you investing further in them?Zomato has had a very good run for the last few months, they have cut down their burn immensely. Revenue has gone up and they are sitting on a lot of cash. I would say they are comfortable today but tomorrow theyll try to raise money as they will need it for growth and opportunities, well see at that point of time.",2017-01-18,UKeBtqn6OUjrVEmDLTAzhP,"Naukri, Info Edge (India) CEO Hitesh Oberoi on Indias changing jobs scenario, investments in Zomato and how Info Edge is growing into an investor role",competitor,00:40,We are worried about a slowdown in IT: Naukri CEO Hitesh Oberoi
-0.35,"Ahmedabad: Essar Ports Ltd, one of the leading port companies in the country, is exploring the option of setting up a greenfield commercial port in Gujarat, according to three officials close to the development. 
				   
				The company has recently given a project proposal to the states maritime regulator Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB) for the same. If it materializes, this would be the companys first all commercial port in the country. Currently, the company operates five ports, all of which are largely for captive purpose although they handle some amount of third party commercial cargo as well. According to the investment proposal made to GMB, the company has proposed an investment of Rs10,600 crore for the port project and it plans to employ about 1,000 people, according to two of the three officials quoted. The company aims to develop a commercial multi-purpose port preferably in Devbhoomi Dwarka district with facilities capable of handling bulk, general cargo, liquid including petroleum and oil lubricants, chemicals and LPG.A senior GMB official in the know of the development said that the Essar Ports wants to develop a commercial port with a draft of about 18 metres with a cargo handling capacity of 100 million tonnes per annum (MTPA). Presently, there are only two commercial ports in India that handle a cargo of 100 MTPA or more including the Adani group run Mundra port in Kutch and Kandla Port Trust run government port in Kandla, Kutch. Reliance Industries captive port at Sikka near Jamnagar handles close to 125 MMTPA, which is mainly used for its refinery and petrochemical projects at nearby Moti Khavdi. Apart from cargo, Essar Ports has also proposed to set up a 5 MMTPA liquefied LNG import and re-gasification facilities for the proposed project.The state maritime board has already identified locations for greenfield ports like Kacchigadh and Maroli for private development and these would be offered to Essar for their new port. However, since this is not a captive project, as the per the states policy for private ports, the regulator might call for bidding, said the same senior GMB official quoted earlier. Essar officials when contacted refused to comment on the development. It was not immediately clear if Essar Ports and the state government would sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) at the upcoming Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit 2017, where a lot of companies are expected to sign such non-binding pacts. Essar Ports had volumes but it could not get value for commercial cargo due to limitations of a captive port. With their expertise in handling port business, a multi-purpose greenfield port in south Gujarat would be more viable as GMB has already identified few good sites in the region. Also, it has good connectivity to northern hinterland and many industries have also set up there, according to Ramesh Singhal, chief executive, i-Maritime Consultancy, which tracks the port and shipping sector.In October, the Essar group promoters Ruia family signed a deal with Russias Rosneft and partner consortium to sell their 98% stake in Essar Oil. The $12.9 billion deal included the 20 MTPA Vadinar refinery and Vadinar Port in Gujarat. It is likely to close by March. The company had said in a 15 October statement that the deal would help Essar deleverage almost 50% of its Rs88,000 crore debt and substantially reduce interest costs. Essar Ports current has a cargo handling capacity of 140 MMTPA which it plans to expand to 194 MMTPA over the next few years. Essar Ports has five operational port terminals at Hazira, Vadinar, Paradip, Salaya and Vizag Iron Ore and is estimated to handle approximately 90 MMT of cargo during FY17.",2017-01-09,UNi2kAWd2saMHnFEp0VJSP,"Essar Ports aims to develop a commercial multi-purpose port preferably in Devbhoomi Dwarka district, if Gujarat Maritime Board grants permission ",both,10:37,"Essar Ports plans Rs10,600 crore greenfield port in Gujarat"
-0.3,"Call it crony capitalism or any other term you wish. Large borrowersand significantly the top 100 largest debtorsare primarily responsible for the bad loan problem in Indian banks. Thats the inescapable conclusion from the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBIs) June financial stability report.
				   
				Consider chart 1: The share of large borrowers in total gross non-performing assets (NPAs) has increased to 86.4% at the end of March. Their share in loans is only 58%. Large borrowers are described by RBI as those who have aggregate fund-based and non-fund based exposure of at least Rs.5 crore. Their share of gross bad loans has increased faster than their share of total bank credit over the past year.Even among large borrowers, it is the largest, the top 100 entities, who are responsible for the sharp deterioration seen following the central banks asset quality review.Consider chart 2: The gross bad loans of the top 100 borrowers, among the largest corporate groups in the country, have jumped to 22.3% of bad loans of large borrowers, up from 0.8% a year ago. Put it another way, these top 100 borrowers account for 19.3% of all bank bad loans at the end of March compared with 0.7% a year ago.That, of course, leads to the question: whats the reason for the sudden spike in bad loans? If anything, economic growth has been improving according to official figures.The answer lies in chart 3.Large borrowers have been enjoying the fruit of banks forbearance for quite some time. After the central banks asset quality review, lenders have been forced to reveal all these skeletons and re-classify them as NPAs. As chart 3 shows, there has been a sharp decline in advances classified as SMA-2 and restructured standard. SMA-2, or special mention account-2, are those accounts where principal or interest payment was overdue between 61 days and 90 days.The decline in these two categories is almost equal to the rise in gross bad loans. That there is still more pain to come is reflected in the 35% increase in assets classified as SMA-1 (principal or interest overdue between 31 days and 60 days), which is an early signal of stress in asset quality.",2016-06-29,URelrQgfpNPeGpDsnIs0xN,"Large borrowers, and significantly the top 100 largest debtors, are primarily responsible for the bad loan problem in Indian banks, says RBIs June financial stability report

-1.0,"London: Big Oil is poised to reap rewards this year as investments made before the crude price slump pay off just as recovery starts.
				   
				Seven of the worlds largest energy companies will together boost oil and natural gas output by 398,000 barrels a day, the most since 2010, according to data from Oslo-based consultant Rystad Energy AS. In 2018, output will rise even faster.The oil majors arent increasing their drilling budgets. Instead theyre benefiting from money invested before the rout. Lower costs combined with higher output would allow companies including Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc to maximize their gains from improved oil prices. Should crude remain above $50 a barrel, 2017 could be a break-out year, eliminating the need to borrow to pay dividends, according to analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein.They could hit a sweet spot this year, said Mark Tabrett, a London-based analyst at Bernstein. Heavy investments of previous years are paying off with more production, costs have been cut and the companies are in a position to take advantage of that when oil prices rise.After reaching an intraday low of $27.10 a barrel on  20 January, Brent oil prices more than doubled to a high of $57.89 on 12 December. The global benchmark rose 52% last year, its biggest yearly gain since 2009. Shares in the majors, meanwhile, rose across the board, led by Shell, whose B shares gained 53% in London, the best annual increase since at least 1990.Brent averaged about $45 a barrel in 2016, and is expected to rise above $55 this year, according to the median of 45 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Yet the majors, still smarting from more than two years of depressed prices, have expressed a reluctance to increase spending.For us this will be about not starting to run too fast, Statoil chief executive officer Eldar Saetre said at a conference in Oslo last week. There wont be a lot of new activity initiated when it comes to larger projects in 2017.2020 problemRystad estimates that the seven companies will boost output by about 670,000 barrels a day next year. Still, years of under-investment during the time when oil prices were low mean the production gains may be short lived.Output should start declining eventually for the majors that slowed project-sanctioning, said Rob West, an analyst at Redburn (Europe) Ltd, a London-based equity broker. Field-by-field models suggest thats a problem for 2020.Much of the expected increase is coming from offshore oil and gas projects approved at the start of the decade, said Espen Erlingsen, vice-president for analysis at Rystad. Theyre the kind of mammoth projects that are difficult to shut down once they get going.Included is Chevron Corp.s Gorgon liquefied natural gas project in Australia, which partly resumed operations last week, and Kazakhstans Kashagan field, in which Eni SpA, Exxon, Shell, and Total SA all have stakes, which began producing last year. Eni expects oil and gas production to climb to a record in 2017 even as spending continues to fall.A plan by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and 11 other nations to curb their supply and boost prices wont stand in the way of these companies growth plans, Redburns West said.While they all have production in Opec countries, the cuts are mostly concentrated outside of the majors portfolios, or cover assets that were declining anyway, he said.The majors are now starting to harvest from the investments they did at the beginning of this decade, Erlingsen said. Production is expected to grow, while investments are falling. Bloomberg",2017-01-11,USaR7mcuMq4D8T2c9vh7pL,"Seven of the worlds largest energy companies will together boost oil and natural gas output by 398,000 barrels a day, the most since 2010",both,10:37,Big oil hits sweet spot as new projects reap rewards of recovery

-0.33,"San Francisco: The US technology industry, a major employer of foreign workers, hit back on Saturday at President Donald Trumps sudden executive order on immigration, with some leaders calling it immoral and un-American. 
				   
				Trumps order temporarily bars citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States even if they hold valid visas or permanent residence permits, a move that caught many companies off-guard.Netflix Inc chief executive Reed Hastings called it a sad week and added: It is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity.Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook sent a letter to employees saying Trumps order was not a policy we support and promised to help affected employees. We have reached out to the White House to explain the negative effect on our coworkers and our company, Cook added. Elon Musk, the South African-born founder of Tesla and SpaceX who met recently with Trump, said on Twitter: The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the countrys challenges.Airbnb co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky said: Not allowing countries or refugees into America is not right and we must stand with those who are affected.Airbnb will provide free housing to anyone not allowed into the United States, Chesky said.Aaron Levie, the outspoken founder and CEO of online storage company Box Inc, said: The executive order on immigration is immoral and antithetical to our values.StrandedFridays order could be a major headache for tech companies, potentially leaving employees stranded overseas and unable to return to the United States. Alphabet Incs Google urgently called back employees from overseas and told ones who might be affected by the ban not to leave the United States. CEO Sundar Pichai said in an email to staff that more than 100 Google employees were affected by the order, according to a Google executive. One Google employee of Iranian nationality with legal US residency made it back to the United States just hours before the order took effect, the executive said.Were concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the US, Google said in a statement. Microsoft Corp president and chief legal officer Brad Smith said in a company-wide email posted on LinkedIn that 76 company employees were citizens of the seven countries in question and held US work visas, and thus were directly affected by the order. He said the company had not determined how many people with green cards, or permanent residence status, might be affected.As a company, Microsoft believes in a strong and balanced high-skilled immigration system, Smith said in the post. We believe in the importance of protecting legitimate and law-abiding refugees whose very lives may be at stake in immigration proceedings.Uber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick, who has faced criticism from some employees for participating in President Trumps business advisory council, said in a statement that the company would compensate drivers from the seven countries who might not be able to return to the United States for three months or more. He said the company knew of about a dozen affected employees.This ban will impact many innocent people - an issue that I will raise this coming Friday when I go to Washington for President Trumps first business advisory group meeting, Kalanick said.Facebook Inc CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a post on Friday that was concerned about the order and voiced support for immigrants.

-0.31,"For the past two decades, every time the management of Dabur India Ltd met to finalize a new product, it ended up also debating whether to stick to Ayurveda or to focus on non-Ayurvedic products.
				   
				The decision to launch non-Ayurvedic products came 113 years after S.K. Burman set up Dabur in 1884 in Kolkata. In 1997, the home-grown Ayurvedic products maker launched Project STARS (Strive to Achieve Record Successes) to accelerate growth through diversification. It launched Real, a fruit-based beverage.Ayurveda cannot take Dabur far, the Burmans were convinced. So, the family that popularized Ayurveda in India moved away from its core strength.Over the next 19 years, the companys focus intensified so much on non-Ayurveda products that just the food business accounted for about 11% of its Rs8,436 crore revenue in the year to March 2016 and 18% of domestic sales came from foods. Not just food, it launched a number of non-Ayurvedic products in segments like personal care and home care as well. Overall, about 40% of its sales came from non-Ayurvedic products in the year to March 2016. The wheel of change was set for a spin. But then came yoga-guru-turned-businessman Baba Ramdev. Under his company Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd, he launched a range of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) based on Ayurveda. In recent months, ever since Patanjali started aggressive advertising on television, it has challenged companies such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), Colgate-Palmolive (India) Ltd, Nestlé India Ltd that compete in Indias Rs3.2 trillion-a-year consumer packaged goods market.Theres more. Going by Ramdevs projections, Patanjali will cross Rs10,000 crore in revenue in fiscal year 2017from Rs5,000 crore in FY16. This is more than what brokerage firm Morgan Stanley India Co. Pvt Ltd projected as Dabur Indias revenue in FY17Rs 9,630 crore.Besides, Dabur started feeling the pinch as sales of its honey (a product that is estimated to have more than 65% market share) started declining earlier this year as people  bought Patanjalis cheaper variety.The Burmans realized that Dabur needs to get back to basics and return to its coreAyurveda.The future, says Dabur India chief executive officer (CEO) Sunil Duggal, will be driven by Ayurvedic products. With this validation (success of Patanjali), we are more committed to staying and growing the natural equities and not string into other domains. So it provides a lot more focus to the companys activities and a lot more opportunities to grow within spaces that we are familiar with rather than to get into unfamiliar spaces which obviously would be much riskier, he adds.There were reasons why Dabur was unsure about sticking to only Ayurvedic products.The Burmans wanted to build an empire outside Indiaacross the Middle East, Africa, Europe, North America and South Asia, which together accounts for 32% of Daburs consolidated sales at present. Across all these countries, Ayurveda was never a popular or saleable concept. So the shift was only  natural.Although Dabur was probably the only Indian company that was selling products made of Ayurvedic formulations nationwide, it was unsure about how far it could take Ayurveda. Till recently, the ability of Ayurvedic products to go deeper was under some question. Ayurveda can go deep in certain areas, not all. Like skin care, it may not go that deep. But we are now beginning to question that paradigm. Now we are far more convinced that Ayurveda can go far deeper in many areas than what we thought earlier, says Duggal.Faith vs evidence A couple of months ago, the company revamped its marketing communications with a new taglineScience-based Ayurveda. So far, it was celebrate life. All our advertisements and other communications are now based on one themeScience of Ayurveda. There have been changes in packaging and marketing communications as well. We need to be relevant to the youth, says K.K. Chutani, executive director (marketing) at Dabur India. Besides, in February this year it tied up with e-commerce marketplace Snapdeal to set up an e-store for its Ayurveda products called LiveVEDA. Chutani believes, e-commerce was an imperative for Daburs future.The rationale behind Daburs new communication is its history. The Burmans have been marketing Ayurveda for more than 130 years. But it cant just bank on its history or legacy. The platform that we are going to leverage is the science-based Ayurveda, backed by research, validation and hard evidences. It will appeal to a lot of people who may not believe in faith-based Ayurveda (unlike Ramdevs followers), adds Chutani. Emergence of Patanjali, believes CEO Duggal, is a blessing in disguise for Dabur. Patanjali products are sold primarily based on peoples faith in Ramdev. His marketing and Patanjalis well-spread retail presence has already, and probably would, convert a lot of non-Ayurdevic product users into regular users of Ayurvedic or herbal products. There has been some learning from Ramdev. To my mind, he has given a big impetus to Ayurveda and his large number of followers are driving it. The desire for Ayurvedic solutions runs very deep in Indian psychology. It would be very silly of us not to take advantage of that, says Duggal, who joined Dabur in 1995 and became CEO in 2002.By 2020, Dabur targets Ayurvedic products to constitute more than 75% of its sales in India, from around 60% now.To focus more on Ayurvedic formulations, the company is doubling its herb cultivation. By March 2017, Dabur will have 3,800 acres for medicinal herb farming, up from about 2,000 acres at present that it has developed during past two decades. It also has a greenhouse at Pantnagar in Uttarakhand. The company will be spending Rs600 crore in back-end supply chain. The medicinal farming will be spread across eight states in India and Nepal, and engage about 2,500 farmers, up from 1,200 at present.We have been marrying the age-old Ayurvedic heritage and traditions with cutting-edge scientific prowess. We have a strong in-house research wing that follows a bush-to-brand approach. We have our in-house nursery, which grows several rare herbs that go into various products. Dabur is probably the only company which is involved in both classical or ethical as well as OTC (over-the-counter) formulation research for close to 40 years now, says J.L.N. Sastry, head (research and development, Ayurveda) at Dabur India. In a note on 21 September, Citi Research, a division of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., said, Dabur claims to focus on science-based high quality Ayurveda products with an emphasis on R&D, which makes it well positioned to ride this wave.Countering PatanjaliIn May, Dabur launched an advertisement for its honey which said it was approved by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) that ensures safety. Patanjalis honey does not have FSSAI approval. The ad came on the back of a drop in sales of Dabur honey at the beginning of the year. The company has been selling honey since 1994  and dominates the market with close to a two-thirds share.However, Patanjali honey directly hit Dabur primarily because of the price difference. Daburs honey was priced about 40% higher than Patanjalis. We got things corrected through offers and other things. We find people who switched are returning. But there is a section of people, financially stressed, who may not come back. But we have to deal with that. We cant have all things for all people, says Duggal. The company also launched brand extensions like honey fruit spreads.Interestingly, in an earlier Mint interview, Ramdev said his rivalry was with multinational companies (MNCs) not the home-grown ones like Dabur. But a Patanjali spokesperson said that even if Dabur is an Indian company, it has no right to loot people. Products are overpriced. Be it an Indian company or MNC, it should operate ethically, and products should be economical. With Patanjali, backed by Baba Ramdevs marketing, the market for Ayurvedic and herbal or natural products has expanded, which certainly is an opportunity for everyone, he added.Commenting on FSSAI certification, or the lack of it, the spokesperson said that Patanjalis honey had passed all required tests and is safe. As honey is a products that is consumed both as a medicine and a food item, FSSAI approval is not mandatory, he added.Besides honey, even Daburs toothpaste sales were impacted but Duggal dismisses concerns about it by saying the category has not been growing. In fact, Dabur Chyawanprash, the market leader with an estimated 65% share, also faced stiff competition after Patanjali started mass marketing Chyawanprash at a much lower price last year. But its impact was not severe, maintains Duggal.However, Dabur narrowed the price gap with Patanjali and tried establishing Chyawanprash, a predominantly winter product, as a product relevant for others seasons like monsoon through intense promotional activities. With Patanjali coming in, the category might grow better. He (Ramdev) will convert a lot of non-users into Chyawanprash users. He could be a good ambassador for Chyawanprash, adds Duggal.In a note on 21 September, Citi Research  said, Dabur has been managing competitive intensity well through brand building (strong digital push), value-added variants or formats and by reducing price premiums in segments like honey with price-offs and promotions... Reducing the pricing premium with extra weight (such as 1.25 kg for the price of 1 kg) and / or price-offs, upping the ante on honey brand building and the extension to value-added variants and formats are examples of a well-rounded approach to tackle the aggressive competition from Patanjali.Daburs challenge, according to Sunita Sachdev, an analyst with UBS Securities India Pvt. Ltd, is to re-invent its brand and make itself relevant to the current crop of consumers. Getting back to its rootsAyurvedais very appropriate, said Sachdev.Peer pressureDabur India isnt under pressure from Patanjali alone. Competition in the domestic market in the last few years has increased as almost every packaged goods companyhome-grown and multinationalhas rolled out products that are herbal or natural. The trend has been triggered largely by Patanjalis success and the opportunity the category offers for premiumization of products.In recent years, HUL and Colgate, local units of MNCs, have ramped up their portfolios with premium Ayurvedic products in key brands. Home-grown Emami Ltd and Himalaya Drug Co., which have been selling herbal or Ayurvedic products for long, have gained from their traditional herbal positioning. These companies are extending brands into new and emerging segments to improve profitability. And all of them are trying to expand. While Emami bought Ayurvedic hair oil and shampoo brand Kesh King from SBS Biotech Ltd in June 2015 for Rs1,651 crore, HUL acquired Kerala-based Indulekha hair oil brand for Rs330 crore earlier this year to boost its presence in Ayurvedic space.Interestingly, Dabur was the first to tap the hair oil space with a herbal product Dabur Amla hair oil back in 1940 and expanded its hair care portfolio in early 1990s with Vatika brand. But it failed to leverage the advantage of an early entrant.Admits Duggal, We never thought products like shampoo can be marketed as an Ayurvedic product. With recent developments in the market, we are now thinking of launching Ayurvedic shampoo. Some of our bets will work, some may not. But Ayurveda can go beyond the imagination of people.Herbal or Ayurvedic still constitutes a very small part of personal care market in India. According to a research report (September 2015) by UBS Securities India, herbal products comprise 6-7% of the personal care products market, but the volume is growing at about twice the segment average. The report estimated herbal to grow to about 10% of the segment by FY20 as the trend accelerates.Duggal, however, believes Dabur has the advantage of being a company that has been the original marketer of Ayurveda in India. There are differences between Ayurveda and herbal. Herbal is a step before Ayurveda. Ayurveda is a completely different ball game, he adds.Distressed economyBesides increasing competition, slow growth is a serious worry for Dabur too.In April-June 2016 quarter, the companys sales grew just 1.2%. In the quarter ended March 2016, it reported a 4% increase in volume in the domestic market compared to a 7% growth in the preceding quarter. Post results, the management had painted a cautious outlook for FY17. It expects things to get better only in the second half of FY17. The key challenge that we are facing today is that theres a radical downward shift in the overall consumption of consumer goods because of tapering of the stimulus that was provided by the earlier government and has not been taken forward by the current government. The current government is following an investment-led growth and not consumption-led growth that has triggered a consumption stress, primarily in rural market, which was the prime driver of growth between 2008 and 2014, says Duggal.A double-digit growth is very unlikely in the next one-two years for the packaged consumer goods firms. I am hoping for 6-8%. I never expected this sharp a decline in consumption. I knew it will come down but not from 12% to 3-4%, says Duggal, adding that consumption will improve in  a gradual manner starting 2018.Two consecutive poor monsoons also hurt consumption. A relatively good monsoon, coupled with the seventh pay commission money in the system, is likely to provide some impetus that would help consumption recover. However, the picture is not that dismal as packaged goods companies like Dabur are enjoying high marginsthanks to stability in commodity prices resulting in low input costs. Its a good thing. But the downside of the combination of high margin and low demand will typically lead to a lot of pricing activities. Reduction of prices in some cases and aggressive promotions are obvious. Well have to deal with that aspect. Some of the margins may be passed on to the consumers, adds Duggal.Rewriting ruralAbout 45% of Dabur Indias domestic revenue comes from rural markets and, as mentioned above, consumption in rural markets has not been growing for the last few years. Naturally, the company not only stopped expanding its distribution network in rural areas, in the last one year it also stepped out of certain markets to minimize its risk.Thats not all. It also reorganized its sales force in rural markets. The company hired about 1,000 people to sell its products in villages starting this April. Earlier, village sales representatives were under the payrolls of third-party human resource companies. Dabur is shelling out the same amount of money but the village sales representatives are earning more as their salaries are not being shared by third-party firms. They are the sons of the soil. They understand these markets. With them coming on our rolls, productivity and sales have improved. Rural markets will start growing again. Well ramp up distribution and marketing to capture the growth prospects thats expected in the second half of the year, adds Duggal. Dabur typically pays Rs2 lakh a year and incentives to the village sales representatives.Tweaks in distribution and go-to-market efforts, according to the Citi Research note, will help Dabur improve productivity of the enhanced footprint, besides doctor detailing could be a key driver for healthcare offerings.For urban markets, the company, in June, divided its portfolio in four pieces home and personal care, healthcare, OTC medicines, and food and beverages. Theres a separate sales team for each of these segments. Earlier there were three segmentsOTC, FMCG and food. The change is aimed at bringing a deeper focus on individual segments.Dabur products now reach around 5.3 million outlets. In comparison, HUL reaches about 6.3 million of the estimated 8 million retail outlets in India. Cigarette-to-shampoo maker ITC Ltd reaches to around 4.3 million retail stores.Advantage spreadDabur has a unique mix of diverse growth enginesjuices, healthcare, skincare, international business and home care. And, it has four cash cowshair oils, digestives, health supplements and toothpastes. The growth engines, noted Morgan Stanley in a report, can use cash cows to generate consistent, superior growth. Dabur has the ability to launch highly differentiated product offerings across its product portfolio, catalyzed by the recent success of Patanjali, increase in disposable incomes, lifestyle changes and increasing awareness of Ayurvedic products, it report added.OTC products are seen as the most exciting growth opportunity for Dabur, backed by the companys brand strength, knowledge of Ayurveda, doctor advocacy, and product heritage. We expect a slew of launches over the next few quarters with a focus on daily healthcare and lifestyle ailments. This business also has one of the best gross profit margin profiles. We believe growth will inflect as consumers perceive these products as being efficacious for overall health and wellness and likely balance out the adverse impact of rapid changes in lifestyles currently under way, said the Morgan Stanley analysis.Eyes on buysAcquisition was one of the routes that helped Dabur grow, mainly in markets outside India. The company, which has more than Rs2,200 crore of cash on its balance sheet, is now looking for buyouts in India to ensure faster growth. In the last few years, organic growth has been slow and Dabur has not made a pitch to acquire any firm. The companys deals team is already working on a few targets. Despite the fact that the management is open to spending about Rs1,000 crore on acquisitions, Dabur is only looking for small buys. I like small brands that are scalable, primarily regional brands with national relevance. I hope to close at least one deal by end of this financial year, says Duggal.Dabur is looking at Ayurvedic brands and brands in the adjacent areas. It is unlikely to buy any company that is in the generic products space as that could conflict with its existing product offering. There are a few generic products, but buying a generic product maker would be replication. Thats one of the reasons why we did not buy Zandu (which got sold to Emami in 2008), he adds.Likely acquisition targets could be companies that make branded proprietary products in areas such as digestion, cough and cold, fever, lifestyle disease management, among others. However, there are not many targets in the market.Acquisitions make sense. Despite high valuations, Emamis acquisition of Kesh King and HULs Indulekha buyout were relatively successful, says Sachdev of UBS Securities.Its key acquisitions in India include Balsara Hygiene Products Ltd, maker of Babool toothpaste and Odonil air freshner, in 2005 and female skin care products maker Fem Care Pharma in 2008. Over the years, some of the brands it acquired from these two firms, such as Fem, Babool and Odonil, have crossed the Rs100-crore sales mark. Even its international business has primarily grown through acquisitions post- 2010. International woes About 32% of Daburs consolidated revenue comes from international markets by selling personal care products across the Middle East, Africa, Europe, North America and South Asia. The Middle East is the biggest market that accounts for 33% of the companys international sales, followed by Africa (22%), Americas (17%), Asian markets excluding India (17%) and Europe (11%).But companies, including Dabur, have been facing challenges in these markets mainly due to political uncertainties, currency fluctuations and falling oil prices. Low oil prices have led to a downward pressure on oil producing economies with governments adopting austerity measures, curbing spending on major projects and reducing subsidies which has eroded disposable incomes. Most of the markets have witnessed sharp depreciation in their currencies which has led to lower value realizations in our business. Geo-political turmoil in MENA (Middle East and North Africa) has, to a large extent, impacted markets such as Syria, Libya, Yemen, Iraq and others where there has been a reduction in consumption due to large scale displacement of human population, says Mohit Malhotra, CEO of Dabur International Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dabur India.Dabur, however, will continue to invest in these marketsin brands, distribution and building local supply chains to ensure better pricing and margin.Also see | Our aim is to make Dabur a multinational from India: Amit BurmanIn July, Dabur India acquired Discaria Trading, registered in South Africa, for just Rs4,679 (1,000 South African rand). It was a small but important acquisition. With this, the company got an entry to South Africaa market it has been trying enter for a long time. Dabur already has two manufacturing plantsone each in Nigeria and Egypt.Africa has been on the radar of Indian packaged goods and personal care firms for the past few years primarily because of projected consumer spending. Consulting firm McKinsey and Co., in a report in 2010, projected consumer spending in Africa to double to $1.8 trillion by 2020. Dabur made its first foreign acquisition in 2010 by buying Hobi Kozmetik Group, a leading personal care products company in Turkey, for $69 million. It also acquired US-based Namaste Laboratories for $100 million in the same year. Our twin acquisitions took place almost a decade after our entry into the overseas markets and these acquisitions have helped us further consolidate our overseas business. We have emerged as the Indian-born FMCG transnational entirely through the organic route, says Malhotra. Prior to these acquisitions, the company primarily sold hair oil under Dabur Amla and Vatika brands in the overseas markets. Now, its international portfolio is dominated by products it got from acquisitions. According to Citi Research, hair oil accounted for about 39% of sales from international markets together, followed by shampoo (14%), hair cream (13%), oral care (11%), skin care (7%) and styling products (about 12%) in FY16, contrary to hair oil contributing about 93% to the business in FY06.Namaste business has been steady and we believe local manufacturing and distribution in Africa should provide a fillip to the business from 2017 onwards. Local manufacturing would enhance the price competitiveness of Namaste products that are currently imported and thus at a significant price premium. Steps to enhancing sales and distribution for Namaste products in sub-Saharan Africa should help Dabur deepen its presence. For the other overseas operations, management talks of a somewhat lower adverse forex impact vs the previous year. Geopolitical or economic issues in Saudi Arabia and parts of North Africa remain, but the companys foray into Iran could be a new positive driver from second half of FY17, Citi Research said in the 21 September report.Going forward, Dabur will deepen presence in many of the countries in Africa, primarily where it already has presence, and across markets in South Asia. Two markets where it sees a better future are Myanmar and Iran. The company already has a presence in Myanmar, and it is setting up a factory in Iranprobably the last big market thats left unexplored due to blockadeto start selling products early next year.We are open to exploring inorganic opportunities to fill gaps in our existing portfolio and geographic presence, says Malhotra, adding that the company has not earmarked any amount for buys and can fund acquisitions through internal accruals and debt. Sachdev of UBS Securities, however, says there is risk in the international business. Theres also sub-scale which hinders their ability to generate quicker higher returns, she adds.Analysts darlingCompetition may be stiff and growth may be slow but Dabur India is considered an attractive investment proposition in consumer staples by equity analysts.Over FY16-18, noted Morgan Stanley in its report on 25 April, Dabur will become the most expensive staples stock from one of the cheapest now.

-0.27,"Lead acid battery makers had a nice ride for many quarters on the back of high demand and good profit margins. But the road ahead may be arduous as the odds are mounting against these firms.
				   
				The two market leaders Exide Industries Ltd and Amara Raja Batteries Ltd may see weaker demand in the replacement market. This is a rub-off of weak automobile sales, mainly four-wheelers, between fiscal years 2012 and 2015. After all, replacement market sales follow automobile sales with a two- to three-year lag. A slowdown in the replacement market sales is worrisome as this segment brings in about two-thirds of the operating profit for battery makers.Next, some analysts say that there could be saturation in market share gains too. A report by Kotak Institutional Research says, Organized players (primarily Amara Raja) have outperformed industry growth due to market share gain from smaller unorganized players over the past five years. Together, Amara Raja and Exide have almost 90% market share in the four-wheeler replacement segment and further market share gains in this segment are unlikely.If at all, some growth is likely in two-wheeler replacement market sales. But then, the operating profit accretion from this segment is lower than that from four-wheelers.Also, like most other commodities, lead prices too have risen by a significant 20-25% in the last six months. This will weigh on profit margins until the battery makers are able to pass on this cost increase to consumers. Given that the replacement market growth rate is likely to be subdued, manufacturers may be cautious in increasing battery prices in the replacement market. Some brokerage firms have justifiably trimmed operating margin forecasts for both Exide and Amara Raja by about 50 basis points for FY18. Only better-than-expected sales in the next two quarters can offset the impact of rising lead prices. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.All the above factors triggered some sell-off in both company stocks since November. That said, at current levels, Amara Raja shares trade at a richer valuation (about 23 times FY18 earnings estimate) than Exides, which trade at around 17 times. The formers scorching pace of sales and earnings growth in the last decade saw its valuation race past its competitor and market leader. However, from these levels any further rise in stock prices will be powered by a favourable turnaround in the factors detailed above, which are critical to battery makers.",2017-01-06,Ul4rOF47pjINCDwNcMu16L,A slowdown in the replacement market sales is worrisome as this segment brings in about two-thirds of the operating profit for battery makers,competitor,07:46,"Odds stack up against battery makers Exide Industries, Amara Raja Batteries "
-0.98,"One of the authors of this article built a speech recognition engine in the early 1990s. It was built on a special purpose digital signal processor, in a lab that was especially dedicated to this project. The engine required two days of training, could recognize a single voice and had a vocabulary of close to 50 words. It was close to state-of-the-art at that time. 
Cut to the present. All smartphones today have the ability to recognize speech. No special hardware is needed. Training needs are minimalthe technology works straight out of the box and can be trained to recognize anybodys voice. And the vocabulary is infinite. The phenomenon that enabled this rapid change is the advancement in processing power, storage and communication. Computing speed is doubling every year, as per Moores law, which predicted an exponential growth in the number of transistors in integrated circuits within processors. Similar stories of transformation can be told about storage and communication. Todays technology road maps have gone beyond the classical Moores law with the advent of distributed computing, rapid development of smart devices packed with sensors and the Internet of things.While we have seen a lot of technology transformations over the last 20 years, what is even more fascinating is the expectation that the next two decades will see technology innovations being rolled out at a faster pace than ever before. Technological change will continue to be exponential. Noted inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil argues that there is even an exponential growth in the rate of exponential growth! What this means is that in the 21st century, we wont see a 100 years of technological progress. We will see 20,000 years of progress at todays rate.FIVE BIG TECHNOLOGY THEMES FOR THE FUTUREWhile there are many technological advancements taking place all around us, we think five big themes will play a very important role in defining the next 20 years.Gene is the new Byte: In the grand scheme of things, we are all very similar. In fact, 99.9% of our genes are identical. Its the last 0.1% that makes all the difference! In April 2003, the human genome was completely mapped for the first time. The rate of reduction in the cost to sequence a persons genome has outpaced even Moores law, from $10 million in 2008 to just $1,000 today. Going forward, this cost is likely to continue dropping and in the near future, we would be able get our complete genome mapped and stored in USB drives or on the cloud for a mere $100. This will open the doors to fantastic possibilities for preventive healthcare and personalized medical treatment. Genome mapping has large implications for agriculture as well, with possibilities like the development of more productive and disease resistant crops, or the creation of diet plans tailored to suit our respective heredities!Disruptions in energy: The end of energy as we know is near. Advancements in technology have reduced the cost of solar energy to 45 cents a watt from $100 a watt in 1970. Interestingly, during this period, other forms of energy have seen a 16-fold increase in price. The average cost of solar panels fell by 75% between 2009 and 2014, and is expected to decline by another 25% by 2018. Solar power tariffs are expected to reach grid parity in India in 2018, and then go below that level. Battery technology is advancing rapidly to help store this energy. Polymer and hybrid-flow battery technology being developed currently will increase energy density, increasing the storage capacity of a given physical space. It is likely that in the near future, many of us will be able to generate, store and use clean solar energy right off our rooftops, at a cost cheaper than buying electricity from the grid. With smart micro-grids, one will even be able to sell excess energy back, creating a truly distributed energy network.Advancements in material science: In Star Trek, the science fiction television show, the crew on-board starships used food replicators to synthesize any meal they wanted while travelling through space. This surreal concept is now inching towards reality. 3D printers have come a long way since the 1980s, and are soon going to be affordable enough for educational and residential usage. Nanomaterials with unique optical, electronic and mechanical properties are driving the next generation of consumer electronics, filtration systems and biomedical treatment. Similarly, advances in biodegradable plastics augur well for environmentally friendly packaging in the future. Ubiquitous digital connectivity: Ubiquitous digital connectivity has been elusive so far although it has been widely talked about by policymakers and technologists. But it is inevitable. Digital access will become more and more affordable as prices reduce. Consumers will increasingly bracket digital connectivity among needs as basic as roti, kapda and makaan (bread, clothes and home), and will allocate a larger share of wallet for it. Digital governance platforms will help governments significantly improve the distribution of subsidy programmes targeted at people with limited means and lastly, corporates that stand to benefit heavily from a burgeoning consumer class may make the economic trade-offs differently. AI and robotics revolution: Artificial intelligence (AI) is already a reality today with Google Search, Siri and IBM Watson being some examples. Todays AI tools excel at complex analytics. In 2016, AI mastered Go, widely considered the most difficult strategy game. However, it struggles with cognitive tasks that a two-year-old can dofor example, knowing the difference between the pictures of a cat and a dog. Genetic algorithms being developed today will strengthen AIs cognitive reasoning capabilities. Limitations on raw computational power will soon be overcome, powering AI tools to do what human brains can. Meanwhile, rapid advances in robotics, such as the development of bio-hybrid robots built using living tissue, are starting to take shape. We are on the cusp of an explosion in AI and robotics, which could make androids a reality in the near future.The interplay between these technology megatrends has the potential to significantly change the world as we know it today. Imagine solar energy-powered 3D printers being airlifted to disaster zones to provide food to people trapped there. Or, a mother in Salem, Tamil Nadu, getting her sons genome mapped, and later getting on a video conference with a New York-based doctor to seek allergy treatment options.Fundamental paradigm shifts driven by accelerating technologyChange in technology fundamentally shifts the production possibility frontier. Every time we hit the law of diminishing returns, newer technology provides a breakthrough. In addition to fundamental shifts in the cost curvewhich are a giventechnology expands the gamut of the possible by significantly altering core trade-offs. Let us look at three conventional business and economic trade-offs, which are getting busted:Two-way real-time interactions versus one-way outreach: In the past, businesses could either focus on rich information tailored to a niche market or reach out to a larger market that sacrificed richness for the additional reach. However, today, two-way, real-time communication with rich and relevant content has become a reality. Digital technology enables access to global platforms for buying and selling, marketing and financing from anywhere. Advanced analytics, combined with mobile technology, is allowing companies to target each consumer individually, across their entire client base. For example, if it is raining, your regular coffee shop can tempt you to brave the weather and visit it by offering you a promotional scheme on your favourite drink, through an app on your smartphone.Supply and demand mismatch: With the shift towards elimination of bespoke hardware, and value migrating to software, it is possible today to match supply with demand almost perfectly. Increased access and connectivity via technology is driving a revolution in the sharing economy as well. Sharing is not new to us. The barter system has been in place for centuries, long before money was invented. Today, we are not only sharing digital information, we are also sharing physical things like homes and vehicles with each other, using digital market places.Scale versus cost: Technology is not only rapidly reducing servicing costs, it is also increasingly enabling businesses to move to an opex spend model, from the erstwhile capex heavy approach. This is helping expand firms reach to new consumers at a faster rate than ever before. For example, consumers with very low deposits can be served economically in an opex spend model, telecom base stations no longer need minimum efficient scale, retail distribution can be customized economically at a micro-market level, and 3D printing can significantly change manufacturing scale. SPECIFIC IMPLICATIONS OF ACCELERATING TECHNOLOGY FOR INDIARadical innovation with next-generation technology architecture:The Internet has served as the main platform for disruption across industries. Its architecture is decentralized, modular and stacked. Lower down the stack, the focus is on scale and efficient utilization, for example, server capacity. Higher up the stack, however, the focus is on content related to user needs and innovation. This stack-based architecture eliminates the trade-off between efficiency and innovation, as higher-layer innovators can rent scale from lower-level platform providers to conduct experiments at lower costs. This is already a reality in our lives. Case in point, Uber, which uses a stacked architecture comprising GPS, Google Maps, electronic payments and connected smartphonesnone of which it ownsto offer a disruptive and consumer-friendly transportation solution.In India, we are witnessing the rising usage of a similar stacked architecture, called the India Stack, in the financial services sector. Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar and mobile phones have created a fundamental layer of customer identification and access, on which multiple digital transactions can be built. This has the potential to solve our financial inclusion problem by eliminating the classical roadblocks of paper-based identity proofs, interaction with a physical bank and the availability of hard cash. The entire stack is an open resource, which means anyone can access and leverage it. A similar open stack architecture is being used by the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) to provide a platform for tax data management and reporting. The platform will provide the plumbing to bring together all GSTN stakeholders including taxpayers, banks, and central and state governments to completely transform Indias tax landscape.This is paradigm shift in technology architecture where innovation happens at the bottom of the stack and is available as a public good at a very low cost to everybody. The implications of this shift are quite profound and if deployed well can be used to address some of our very core socio-economic challenges.Ability to address Indias chronic challenges: Healthcare is one of the most complex challenges of our time, with the infrastructure and capital required to fix the problems and reduce the inequity in healthcare access being insufficient so far. Despite making progress over the last decade, India accounts for a disproportionate percentage of global incidences of disease. We have seven doctors for every 10,000 people, which is only half the average global doctor-patient ratio. Large-scale change is never easy, but technology holds extraordinary promise in helping address our healthcare challenges.By leveraging the technology stack already in placewide connectivity through mobile phones and high-speed data networks, Aadhaar, digitization of health recordswe can significantly improve every element of our health system, from education for prevention, to treatment and management. Big Data and analytics can fundamentally alter healthcare delivery and transform our public health and medical research initiatives through the establishment of national registries. India can become data-rich very rapidly. And a nationwide, connected, many-to-many health information highway with common data standards and interoperability features can just be what the doctor ordered! A similar approach can also be deployed in critical areas such as education and skilling, and it can fundamentally transform how India teaches and learns.Enabling organizations to be trailblazers: Historically, Indian firms have found it hard to address the challenges of low average purchasing power, lack of minimum efficient scale and widespread socio-economic inequity. With the acceleration of technology, these challenges get decimated. Acceleration in technology, coupled with relatively lower legacy investments, gives Indian firms the opportunity to leapfrog their peers to become global trailblazers. Technology makes investments modular, reducing capital outlays and experimentation costs, while increasing speed and agility, which are critical advantages in todays dynamic macroeconomic environment. There is every reason to believe that the next Alibaba, Amazon, Google, Tesla or Uber can emerge out of India.GOING FORWARD, WE NEED TO ADDRESS THREE KEY AREAS TO UNLOCK THIS TECHNOLOGY REVOLUTION1. How do we ensure sufficient investment in infrastructure at the lower level of the stack?Private returns on infrastructure investments are often substantially lower than the underlying social benefits generated. While benefits accrue to the economy at large through positive externalities, this does not assure returns for the infrastructure investor. Also, when infrastructure investment requires an entirely new generation of expensive technology, such as fibre, 4G or 5G, it can compound market failure. The government, through policy formulation, has a key role to play in encouraging sufficient investment in infrastructure.2. What changes should be make in our education system to equip our youth for the technology revolution?There is a need to rethink technology and vocational skills being imparted at higher education institutions. Future jobs will be very different from those in the market today. In addition to solving the existing challenges our education system faces, we need to ensure that it equips our youth with the necessary multidisciplinary skills to meet the needs of tomorrow. 3. How do we drive collaboration across stakeholders to unlock the full potential of technology-enabled transformation?The government, large corporates, start-ups and NGOs have different strengths and capabilities. There is a need to draw upon the expertise of all these stakeholders, and marrying together their complementary skills. We need the right policies and construct for public-social-private partnerships to make this happen.In summary, technological change is accelerating at an unprecedented pace and will change the world as we know it.

0.22,"Mumbai: More than half the BSE-100 companies that have reported September quarter results have beaten earnings estimates, but analysts say a broad-based earnings recovery is still at least two quarters away.
				   
				A Mint analysis of quarterly earnings of 53 members of the BSE-100 index shows that 28 of them have exceeded consensus earnings estimates by Bloomberg. Similarly, 14 out of the 30 Nifty-50 firms that have reported their earnings have beaten expectations.Contrary to what the September quarter earnings show, analysts say there are no visible green shoots of an economic revival and volume growth in sectors such as consumer staples and cement indicate subdued demand. The earnings season has not provided any signs of an incipient economic recovery and management commentary on demand for the next two-three quarters is generally subdued, said a 1 November Kotak Institutional Equities note to clients.  Volume growth will become increasingly relevant as a driver of profits from here on as the scope for reducing costs to improve earnings is largely over, the note added. Sharing a similar view, Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd, in a 2 November note, said the fiscal second-quarter earnings season has been in line with expectations so far on the headline numbers front, but much better on internals (earnings breadth, upgrade/downgrade ratio, surprise vs., miss ratio). Volume growth trends have been mixed.The dismal performance of Indian information technology (IT) companies and banks, especially Axis Bank Ltd, added to the disappointment of investors. There were expectations that bad loan issues could bottom-out in Q2, but that has not happened. In the IT sector too, there is a lot of disruption and large-cap IT stocks could take time to gather the momentum they had earlier, said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities Ltd. The poor volume growth reported by packaged consumer goods companies indicates that rural spending has not yet picked up despite normal monsoon rainfall, he added.Another point of concern is whether companies will be able to sustain their profitability at the levels seen in the quarter ended 30 September. Some analysts say that a surge in global commodity prices will limit further expansion of operating margins even as  the benefits of low input prices from inventory acquired at lower cost is likely to fade away soon. One of the highlights of this result season is that some sectors have shown margin expansion on the back of lower commodity prices which is not sustainable going forward, so margins will not stay at these levels, said Vaibhav Agrawal, head of research at Angel Broking Ltd. But how deeply rising input costs will dent profitability will be known after December quarter earnings, analysts said. Companies may have to resort to price hikes if raw material prices rise substantially.Meanwhile, the wait by investors for the positive impact of a normal monsoon and seventh pay commission payouts to reflect on companies performance has got a bit longer. We will have to wait for one or two more quarters to see signs of rural spending revival and its impact on economic growth, Jasani said.",2016-11-03,Up1k7NidxDziMcC5XxKUxJ,"Broad-based earnings recovery is still at least two quarters away, say analysts",competitor,01:42,"Earnings pick up in September quarter, but no turnaround yet"
0.44,"In 2011, only about 9% of all transactions made using credit and debit cards in India happened at a point of sale (through the swiping of the card at a merchant location), with the remaining 91% being accounted for through ATM withdrawals.
				   
				In August 2016, the latest month for which data is available, this number had risen to 17%. In other words, Indians have gotten significantly more comfortable swiping their credit and debit cards at points of sale in the last five years.There are two factors that have contributed to this trend.First, the use of credit cards (seldom used at ATMs) has gone up in this period. While the absolute number of credit cards in circulation has only gone up by about 50% between April 2011 and August 2016 (from 18 million to 26 million), their usage has increased by nearly a factor of four, from Rs7,100 crore in April 2011 to Rs26,000 crore in August 2016.Looking at it another way, each credit card in circulation was used an average of 1.3 times a month in April 2011, a number that went up to 3.2 times a month in August 2016. Second, the usage patterns of debit cards has changed in the last five years. In April 2011, less than 3% of all debit card transactions (by value) was at a point of sale, while in August 2016, this figure had gone to nearly 8% (by number of transactions, the corresponding figures are 5.3% and 14.7%, respectively).Interestingly, as the usage of debit cards at points of sale has gone up, average per-transaction value of a debit card swipe has actually gone down over time. In other words, people have over time become more comfortable with using debit cards for small transactions.ALSO READ | How to deal with loss of credit/debit cards and online frauds?Coming back to the overall use of credit and debit cards at points of sale (relative to usage at ATMs), the months where Diwali has occurred in the last five years show an interesting pattern.

				Delays gaining regulatory approval for Wi-Fi in Indian airspace arent dissuading satellite operator Inmarsat Plc, which said its talking preemptively to carriers, including Jet Airways India Ltd and the local unit of Singapore Airlines Ltd, about enabling connectivity on their flights.We are keeping a very keen eye on movement around the regulatory environment, said Rash Jhanjee, a director for airline market development for India, Middle East and Africa at Inmarsat, in an interview. The Indian consumer, the average business user on these planes, is now expecting connectivity on the ground as well as in the air.Civil aviation secretary R.N. Choubey said there is a fairly good chance permission to operate Wi-Fi in Indian airspace would be given in about 10 days. That was on 24 August, yet officials are no closer to pinpointing a start date. Meantime, all airlines have to disable Wi-Fi access when flying over India, Facebook Inc.s biggest marketa rule foreign airlines have lobbied to have abolished.The home ministry has expressed concern that in-flight Wi-Fi may pose a security threat because of difficulty tracking voice and data usage from the air, and others have questioned whether there would be a market for the service in a nation where discounted base fares start at just 2 cents.Directorate General of Civil Aviation is studying the matter to ensure all of the considerations are adequately addressed, Union minister Jayant Sinha said in an 6 October interview. As soon as that is done, we will issue a statement, he said, declining to give a time frame for a decision.The regulator said its yet to receive a proposal from the aviation ministry on Wi-Fi usage in Indian airspace.Jet Airways, Indias second-largest carrier, began offering in September one-way wireless streaming technology that enables passengers to play a selection of video and audio content directly on their mobile phones and other personal devicesa step toward offering broadband-enabled Wi-Fi connectivity following regulatory approval.Competitive pressure is pushing airlines to match competitors providing cabin connectivity, according to Euroconsult, which said in February that 72 airlines had installed or announced plans to install passenger connectivity systems on board at the end of 2015. Civil aviation officials in China expect restrictions on the use of mobile phones to be lifted by early 2017, paving the way for wider in-flight connectivity.$5.4 billion marketParis-based Euroconsult said it expects the number of connected commercial aircraft to reach 23,100, or 62 percent of the global fleet, by 2020, from 5,300 last year. Revenue from passenger connectivity services will approach $5.4 billion by 2025, from $700 million in 2015, it said.Having a service like Internet on board an aircraft should not be considered as a luxury, said Mark D. Martin, founder of Dubai-based aviation adviser Martin Consulting LLC, in an interview. The Internet today is an imperative. You need to know whats going on around the world. You have to be in touch, you have to be connected.He said airlines should weigh the costs though. Passengers in India pay just $10.36 for every 100km flown, the cheapest in the world, and the Indian regulator has a history of intervening when extra fees are introduced.Viability questionInstalling Wi-Fi can take about 13 days for a typical low-cost Indian airline flying an Airbus A320 jet, cost Rs.29 million, and result in a loss of Rs.184 million in revenue, according to Martins analysis. That would mean a total cost of Rs.26.4 billion for the fleet of IndiGo, the nations biggest carrier, and Rs.5.8 billion for SpiceJet Ltd, the nations second-largest budget airline, Martin said.Its going to be extremely difficult to recover the investment that you need to make for this to be available in an entire fleet, he said.IndiGo declined to comment, an external spokeswoman for the company said in a text message. SpiceJet didnt immediately respond to a request for comment.Free serviceThe demand will be quite good if its free, said Sanjiv Kapoor, chief operating officer of Vistara, a joint venture between Singapore Airlines Ltd and Tata Sons Ltd. The company, which already provides in-flight wireless streaming of pre-loaded content to customers personal electronic devices, is assessing the viability of full Internet connectivitya service it assumes customers wont pay for.With about 462 million people browsing the web in India, the nation is home to 13.5% of the worlds total Internet users, making it the second-biggest user base in the world, according to Internet Live Stats, which tracks Internet usage.Given a choice, as many as 86% of Indian air travelers would prefer to fly with a carrier that offers Internet connectivity, according to a survey Inmarsat did in May. Two in every three said they would pay more for faster in-flight Wi-Fi.A time will come when airlines will provide this as a service, Choubey, Indias civil aviation secretary, said at an industry event in New Delhi on 24 August.

0.38,"New Delhi: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) spending by Indian companies saw a sharp increase in FY16, according to a report released on Monday by CRISIL Foundationthe philanthropic arm of credit-rating company CRISIL.
				   
				The report analysed 1,505 companies out of the 4,887 BSE-listed firms that qualify for CSR spending under the CSR Rules, which came into force on 1 April 2014. The rules direct all companies with a net worth of Rs500 crore or revenue of Rs1,000 crore or net profit of Rs5 crore to spend 2% of their average profit in the past three years on social development.The report shows an increase in the number of firms that are in compliance with CSR Rules and thus the rise in spending, as Mint reported earlier.ALSO READ:  Firms ramp up CSR focus on healthcare, poverty, hungerThe report states that the key focus areas of CSR spending in FY16 were education, skill development, healthcare and sanitationsimilar to those seen among the top 100 National Stock Exchange firms last year in September.CRISIL Foundations analysis shows overall spending increased by a significant 22%, with the bulk of the funds going to education, skill development, healthcare and sanitation initiatives. Average spending rose 29 basis points to 1.64% as compared with 1.35% in FY15, the report said. In absolute terms, the total money spent rose by Rs2,500 crore to Rs8,300 crore in FY16. There were two reasons for the 22% jump in adherence by the larger companiesfirms are overcoming the challenge of large-scale interventions, which takes more time and effort, and they are using implementing agencies, mainly non-governmental organisations, for execution, suggests the report.Among the trend shifts between FY15 and FY16 is the focus of firms on ensuring impact. Ashu Suyash, managing director and CEO, CRISIL suggests that firms are looking to make a difference as a shift was seen towards outcome-based projects in FY16. This is indeed the way to go, as underlined by the Effective Altruism movement worldwide where, instead of doing what feels right, (companies) find the best causes to work on by using empirical evidence and analysis, he says.FY16 was the second year of the CSR Rules being in force and 1,505 companies of the 4,887 listed on the BSE, qualified for CSR spending. Of these, 77%, or 1,158 companies, reported their CSR activities, compared with 1,024 companies, or 75% of the 1,300 eligible in FY15.The higher spend is being seen as a positive step towards increasing private sector involvement in social development.Ramraj Pai, president, CRISIL Foundation, says, The public-private complementarity is great to see because, as a percentage of total government expenditure, India spends significantly less than what other BRICS nations do. So the private sector ramping up where government spending is low is truly synergistic CSR.",2017-01-31,VBRqDSfkqBfq4b8u5i9S4N,"CRISIL Foundations analysis shows overall spending increased by 22%, with the bulk of the funds going to education, skill development, healthcare and sanitation initiatives",company,01:34,Indian companies CSR spending up in 2015-16: Report
-1.0,"Sequoia, like Mint, completed 10 years in India recently. A decade is a long time. Long enough, perhaps, to look beyond the vagaries of short-term investment sentiment. In the last four years, there have been swings in expectations on how Indias technology story will unfold. 2014 and 2015 were characterized by much optimism, strong capital flows, exuberance in valuations and extravagance in company building. 2016 was a year in which companies strengthened their business foundations. But it was also a year of uncertainty and diminished expectations in the community.
				   
				Clouded by such recent history, we often under-appreciate the changes that have taken place over the last decade and underestimate ones which could pan out over the next one. Compare 2006 to 2016and you would realize that we have come a long way, both as an economy and as a tech ecosystem. A decade ago, Indian companies had a market perhaps half to one-thirtieth of the current one, depending on the sector. Venture capital was scarce and only those with inherited wealth were able to start businesses requiring capital. Even till 2010-11, when I founded a company, few people had Internet, even fewer had smartphones and there was no easy way of distributing technology to consumers. What a transformation a decade can unleash. Now, project the growth of the past decade on the next one and the market will be strikingly larger and more attractive for entrepreneurs starting businesses today. At Sequoia, we are excited about helping build technology companies which will serve this market across sectors. We are also hopeful that a few trends will pan out over the next decadeBusinesses will be built with better capital efficiencyIn recent times, Indian tech start-ups have taken significant capital to build  businesses. The biggest eight Indian private Internet companies have raised over $8 billion (around Rs55,000 crore) between them. We believe this will change going forward. Companies of the last decade found an ecosystem where they had to do much on their own. For e-commerce companies, this included their own warehousing, logistics and payments. There were no quality partners. Often, supply quality was poor, so marketplaces had to be full stack to provide a good customer experience. We also saw exceptional competitive intensity, fuelled in some cases by an oversupply of capital and in others by the entry of global players. This increased customer acquisition costs. The partner ecosystem is far better now, the base supply is improving and, as more differentiated business models emerge, competitive intensity and oversupply of capital is reducing. We are already seeing examples of thisVoonik, for instance, took far less capital than Myntra did to build a similar-sized fashion marketplace, thanks to a lighter operating model and outsourced logistics. With these, and the efficacy of engineering, product and sales teams going up with a maturing employee base, companies of the next decade should be more capital-efficient.Newer business models will emerge in existing categories Often entrepreneurs consider a category out of bounds for new businesses because of the presence of an incumbent. We think that a category is never taken and there is always scope for a new player to disrupt existing ones with a superior operating model. For instance, the C2C product commerce space has well-funded and large incumbents such as Quikr and Olx. But Zefo was still able to break into this market by providing a superior customer experience with a different operating model and instilling trust between the buyer and the seller. We expect more of this to happen in the coming decade.More and more sectors of the indian economy will be rebuilt by tech companies As a start-up ecosystem, we are playing in a canvas that covers a small fraction of Indias gross domestic product (GDP). Increasingly, we meet tech start-ups solving problems in sectors considered conventionally unattractive for venture investors. For instance, media, logistics and warehousing. Several sectors have incumbents which have done a poor job of customer service. Over time, most of them would become addressable to tech entrepreneurs and new companies will be built with a tech core, superior customer focus and stronger management. If you are an entrepreneur starting a business today, whats up for grabs is not just the digital market but the next decades $5 trillion Indian economy.With larger and more accessible markets, improving capital efficiency, more sectors of the economy becoming addressable and companies increasingly going after global markets, each year of tech investing in India looks incrementally better. At Sequoia, we wake up every morning excited about the future, and about partnering with entrepreneurs who will shape it.

-0.25,"Nobody expected SpiceJet Ltds June quarter results to surprise positively. On the contrary, expectations were running low after InterGlobe Aviation Ltd (IndiGo) and Jet Airways (India) Ltd reported weaker-than-expected June quarter financials owing to pricing pressure.
				   
				SpiceJets shares had declined about 14% till Tuesday since IndiGo announced its results on 1 August. But SpiceJets June quarter performance changed the trend. Its share price closed 16% higher on Wednesday.To be sure, its not as if SpiceJets fares havent declined. They did, by 3% year-on-year. But this decline was smaller than expected. In comparison, IndiGos average fare had declined 11%. Further, a combination of 37% increase in capacity, an impressive 92.5% load factor and 64% growth in ancillary revenue helped SpiceJets revenue grow 37% to Rs.1,521 crore, according to Kiran Koteshwar, chief financial officer of SpiceJet. Ancillary revenue includes ticket cancellation charges, excess baggage fees, sales of on-board meals, etc.Of course, the lower fuel cost environment helped. Fuel costs as a percentage of revenues declined to 26% from 32% last year though the measure was higher sequentially. But SpiceJets cost per available seat kilometre, or CASK, excluding fuel costs increased 3%. That was on account of the rupees depreciation and a general inflationary pressure, said Koteshwar.Overall operating costs grew at a relatively slower pace than revenues. As a result, operating profit and Ebitdar increased 53% and 57%, respectively, to Rs.192 crore and Rs.451.8 crore. Ebitdar stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and lease rentals. SpiceJets Ebitdar margin came in at 30%, representing an increase over the June 2015 quarter. In comparison, IndiGos Ebitdar margin had declined year-on-year to 33% last quarter.Flat depreciation costs and a decline in finance costs helped SpiceJets net profit more than double to Rs.149 crore. From here on, the outlook really depends on whether the airline can put up such a stellar show on a consistent basis. Domestic passenger growth remains strong. But the current quarter is typically a lean one for the sector and the numbers of aviation companies should reflect that.

				The company also plans to enter the spot LNG market this year, said two officials aware of the development.HPCL has an equal joint venture agreement with Shapoorji Pallonji Port Pvt. Ltd to build the 5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) LNG terminal at Chhara Port. The terminal is expected to be commissioned by 2019. HPCL is in dialogue with at least six parties internationally to source gas for the Chhara LNG terminal that it will complete by 2019. Currently, it is studying the segments and catchment areas where it can market its gas, said the first of the two people mentioned above, speaking on the condition of anonymity as he is not allowed to speak to the media. ALSO READ: Oil marketing firms plan to introduce dynamic pricing at all retail outlets this yearHPCL did not reply to an email questionnaire sent on Tuesday. An HPCL official declined to name the six suppliers citing confidentiality clauses. LNG aggregators and fleet operators such as BP Plc. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc., are among the companies providing access to spot natural gas to interested buyers. Commissioning the terminal will help HPCL source LNG for its own refineries as well as to market natural gas for customers connected through gas pipelines.HPCL, as part of its expansion plan in the LNG segment, is also testing waters to enter the spot market this year. LNG is sold under long-term contracts and spot. Traditionally, the LNG market favoured long-term contracts but since the drop in crude oil and natural gas prices since 2015, spot trades have assumed significance. HPCL may market LNG cargoes of 60,000-70,000 metric tonnes. This, the second of the two persons said, will help the company establish itself in the gas business before it commissions its LNG terminal.According to Bloomberg, spot LNG prices for Singapore as on 3 January stood at $9.062 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) against $8.82 per mBtu.

0.39,"New Delhi/ Mumbai:  Explorers in the worlds fastest-growing oil market are seeking lower taxes on crude produced from local fields to encourage fresh drilling as India tries to reduce its dependence on energy imports.
				   
				State-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) and the biggest private producer Cairn India Ltd. want finance minister Arun Jaitley to at least halve the cess on crude oil production in the Union budget due 1 February. India surprised some explorers last year with its 20% ad-valorem tax on every ton of crude produced locally, moving from a fixed charge. Companies pay more now with crude near $50 a barrel than they did under the old system when it was double the price.Globally, given the low oil price scenario, governments have provided incentives to stimulate and attract investments, said Sudhir Mathur, interim chief executive officer at Cairn India. In India, the cess rate of 20% acts as a disincentive to increase production and commit incremental investments.Attracting investments to boost output from local fields is key for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has made energy security a priority and set a target of cutting oil imports by 10% in the next five years. Reducing the levy will help explorers including ONGC and Cairn India, which oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan estimates will spend $25 billion by the end of this decade. Indias hydrocarbon resources are highly undeveloped and production has been declining for the past several years, prompting the government to nudge companies to invest in reversing the fall and increase energy supplies.New Delhi-based ONGC is spending over $5 billion for its biggest development plan in a deep-sea block in the Bay of Bengal off the countrys east coast. Cairn India also plans to spend as much as $4 billion over the next few years to drill for oil.Asias third-largest economy meets about 80% of its crude oil requirements through imports.We need some money to be left behind so that we are able to flow back into the investment cycle, said A.K. Srinivasan, finance director at ONGC, the nations biggest explorer.Otherwise there will be cash shortage. Already, we are going to run cash shortages.At a price of $55 a barrel, ONGC may have to pay about $11 as cess, compared with $9 when prices were $100 a barrel and the tax was fixed charge, he said. With crude prices firming up, the cost impact of this tax is quite high.Brent oil prices have risen about 17% since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) agreed in November to cut production for six months starting in January. The fuel traded above $100 as recently as September 2014.Firming crude prices may also allow the government to reduce the levy on retail prices for gasoline and diesel, according to Dhaval Joshi, an analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd.India didnt pass on to consumers the entire benefit of crudes price decline from July 2014, increasing excise duty on the two fuels nine times and mopping up about Rs960 billion ($14 billion) in the previous two fiscal years.The government may now look at easing prices as one way of cushioning the impact of its 8 November ban on high-denomination currency notes, which impacted the rural population the most, as it prepares for five state elections this quarter. The consumer price of diesel, the most-used fuel in the country, is at a record while that of gasoline is at the highest since August 2014, according to state-run fuel retailer Indian Oil Corp.s (IOL) website.

-0.24,"The good run continued for Indian metal firms in the September quarter as rising output, firm price trends and measures to protect domestic steel-makers from imports saw their performance improve.
				   
				That saw the BSE Metal index end the September quarter with a 14% gain from the start; it has since then gained another 4%.Demonetisation and its impact on the economy, especially on the real estate sector and as a result on demand for metals, has investors worried. Aggregate data for top metal producing firms show sales rose 7% sequentially, while operating profit rose 43%. This is despite a 14.6% increase in raw material costs. Where firms managed to rein in expenses were on staff, energy and other costs. But better price realizations were what stood out.On the non-ferrous front, zinc led the way with a 10.5% gain over the preceding quarter, coming on the back of a 12.8% gain in the June quarter. Aluminium held on to the gains of 7.9% made in the June quarter. Copper prices stayed soft, however, although its fortunes have turned in the current quarter.On the ferrous side, rising prices of iron ore and coking coal have lent support to steel realizations, too. Steel firms benefited from the minimum import price as imports declined. Even then, as new capacity has begun to ramp up, steel firms had to export to sell surplus output. Domestic demand is better but is still relatively low.In the current quarter, the good news on the realization front continues, although the extent varies depending on the metal. The big question mark in the next few quarters is the impact demonetisation will have. Global metal prices were on fire in November, a welcome distraction that may explain why the metal index is only marginally lower compared with its pre-demonetisation levels. If metal prices continue to increase, producers can probably withstand the short-term adverse effects. If demonetisations effects last for over a year, the sector may feel the pressure from slowing demand.

0.66,"Diageo Plc had to pay an arm and a leg to get Vijay Mallya to give up his position of chairman and non-executive director in United Spirits Ltd (USL).
				   
				It was in April 2015 that USL informed shareholders that the board had lost confidence in Mallyas continuation as chairman. This was after an internal inquiry confirmed funds diversion from USL to UB group companies.But they could not make him go. When Diageo entered as a majority shareholder, it had agreed to keep Mallya as chairman, as long as the UB group held a 1% stake. That smart move on Mallyas part allowed him to remain chairman till date. The current arrangement breaks the stalemate.While Diageo is paying money to Mallya and has made certain other concessions, USL has decided to not proceed on the financial irregularities uncovered in the internal inquiry and also made some financial concessions. In turn, UB group entities will terminate old business agreements with USL, freeing it of further financial obligations.Shareholders may look at this as good riddance. The money was already gone and a long and messy legal battle awaited them if they tried to recover it. The companys management can instead focus their full energies on running the business. Operationally, nothing will change as Diageo-appointed managers are already running the show. The liquor industry is going through difficult times as it is, with regulatory and policy changes affecting growth. USL reported flat growth in the December quarter in volume terms.But the stink from this episode wont go away so soon. News reports indicate that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) may probe the current transaction. There are other investigations going on pertaining to these irregularities. There are questions on whether USL did right by settling or whether it should have tried to recover the amounts. It also raises uncomfortable questions about the quality of governance and oversight, even among well-known listed companies, if irregularities of this nature and magnitude come out only when a newcomer replaces the incumbent management.USLs share has risen by 20% since 18 February, whereas the announcement was made only on 25 February (a day when the share rose by only 2.4%).

-0.22,"Donald Trumps ascendency from a billionaire property developer to the man destined to become the 45th president of the United States is nothing short of mercurial, but it is also clouded with many uncertaintieshe attracts a strange and shadowy following of racists; he has never held public office and is, therefore, politically inexperienced; he has odd ideas about how to deal with immigrants; he wants to tear up trade deals; he has been furiously back-pedalling on election pledges; and theres that misogyny.
				   
				To many, this is nothing short of a nightmare.We have known all about all of the above for months. But theres one area of concern that is only now being addressedthe potential of huge conflicts of interest. What does the advent of a billionaire businessman into the White House mean for good governance, particularly when the entrant is from an industryproperty constructionknown to be rife with corruption?Are we about to see the emergence of the kind of kleptocracies that were known to plunder the national resources of countries back in the Cold War days, with those stolen resources then making their way to secure banks and other assets in the West? A small number of US newspapers have used the word kleptocracy in commentaries about Trumps conflict of interest, but that may be an over-stretch.It is also true that kleptocracies have survived the Cold War in countries such as Pakistan (Asif Ali Zardari), Egypt (Hosni Mubarak) and Nigeria (Sani Abacha). And conflicts of interest have tended to crop up in democracies across the world, including the US and UK.One recent Asian example is Thaksin Shinawatra, the billionaire media mogul who was prime minister of Thailand from 2001 to 2006. Credited with rolling out policies that benefited the rural poor, healthcare and economic growth, Thaksins later years in power were marred by increasingly strident protests over charges of corruption and conflicts of interest. While infrastructure projects were executed, many benefited companies owned by his family. Amid increasing political instability, the Army took over in 2006 and Thaksin, convicted in his homeland, fled to the UK, where he bought the Premier League football club Manchester City for nearly £82 million. Thaksins fabulous wealth (some £4 billion was said to have been frozen by the UK) is comparable to that of Trump, who, according to Fortune magazine this year, is worth $3.7 billion. The magazine, which has scoured the Trump business for 35 years, says his fortunes fell $800 million this year, mainly on account of a softening of New York Citys real estate market, particularly in retail and office.Fortunes investigations into 28 Trump assets show his aircraft alone are worth $35 millionmade up of three Sikorsky choppers, a Boeing 757 aircraft and a Cessna. His overseas property management and licensing deals include at least three in IndiaTrump Gurgaon, Trump Towers Pune and Trump Towers Mumbai, although these luxury condos merely pay Trump to use his name, according to Fortune.Already, according to The Economic Times, Trump has taken time off his busy transition schedule last week to meet with three Indian real estate developers from Panchshil Realty and Tribeca Developers in New York. But Indian property developers wont be the only ones lining up at Trump Towers in New Yorkor may be even Washingtonin search of business opportunities. That is the nature of business. Far more important is how Trump himself approaches such business opportunities. So far, the signs have been decidedly mixed. On the one hand, he recognizes that there is a potential for conflict. The president of the United States is allowed to have whatever conflicts he or she wantsbut I dont want to go by that, he has said. And: In theory, I dont have to do anything, but I would like to do somethingI would like to try and formalize something. I dont care about my business. I dont want to have people saying conflict.But in his very first meeting with a British political figurehis friend and leading Brexiter Nigel Farageafter winning the election, he brought up his objections to a planned wind farm near a luxury golf course he owns in Scotland. Andy Wigmore, a former Brexit communications chief who attended the meeting, said, Mr. Trump kept returning to  the issue of wind farms. He is dismayed that his beloved Scotland has become over-run with ugly wind farms which he believes are a blight on the stunning landscape.When newspapers reported this incident, and other similar incursions of business in his initial political interactions, Trump appeared to lose his temper. Prior to the election, it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world. Only the crooked media makes this a big deal! he wrote on Twitter.Trump is not the first billionaire to want to be president of the US. Ross Perot in 1992 tried to do the same. You cannot possibly legislate to keep millionaires and billionaires from contesting elections in democracies. But the trend increasinglyand this is in line with predictions by 19th century European economists and political scientistsis that of convergence of big business, political power and the media.For anyone worried about the health and future direction of democracies, this above all should be their biggest nightmare, not the ascendance of individuals, however wealthy. That is the real danger from conflict of interest.Dipankars Twitter handle is @Ddesarkar1",2016-12-02,Vr8ZjiLocntMfsaiks5u1J,"What does the advent of a billionaire businessman into White House mean for good governance, particularly when the entrant is from an industry (property construction) known to be rife with corruption",competitor,00:57,Donald Trumps biggest problem: conflict of interest

The private sector lenders results for the September quarter showed enough improvement to cheer investors, starting with a net profit growth of 26% to Rs704.25 crore and an all-time high net interest margin of 4%.
				   
				Since 1 September, its shares have risen 3.19% while banking indices fell by 2%. Clearly, the run-up to its results release has been in anticipation of stellar numbers.What makes IndusInd Bank such an attraction for investors?Besides an improvement in its net interest margin for the eighth straight quarter, the bank reported a loan growth of 26% and said the growth emerges primarily from its high-yielding retail portfolio. This, along with an improving low-cost current account and savings proportion of deposits, has added 12 basis points to the margins during the quarter. A basis point is 0.01%.The 22-year-old lenders net interest income clocked a growth of 33% to Rs1,460.31 crore while non-interest income grew by 24% to Rs1,094.28 crore.An efficient lender is often rewarded, especially in the banking sector awash with inefficiency in both lending and cost management. IndusInd Bank continued to maintain the health of its loan book with asset quality metrics largely unchanged. Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) as a percentage of total loans stood at 0.91% at the end of the September quarter, little changed from the previous quarter. But gross NPAs rose 4.4% sequentially to Rs899 crore at the end of September because of one account, said the management.A diversified loan book, growing low cost deposits and a steady asset quality puts IndusInd Bank in a sweet spot. But at a price-to-book value of 4.2 times earnings of FY16, is it too hot to handle? Analysts have recommended a buy rating even at these valuations.Here is a thread of caution. The lender was expecting relief from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on its exposure to Food Corporation of India. RBI had mandated all banks to make 15% provisioning against this exposure. This shows up in the 35% jump in the provisions of IndusInd Bank.

0.06,"Delhi and Mumbai are such important markets for Indias top telcos that they have allocated over a third of all their investments in spectrum on these two markets. Not so for Idea Cellular Ltd. Less than 11% of its total outlay for spectrum purchases since 2010 has gone to these markets. 
				   
				And these arent the only markets the company has remained underinvested in after the latest spectrum auction. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities wrote in a note to clients that while Idea Cellulars pan-India ambitions remain, it still has a weak mobile broadband footprint in five large marketsDelhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The company has only a single 3G or 4G carrier in these markets, compared to multiple FDD and TDD carriers acquired by its larger competitors. Lets face itIdea doesnt have a parent that can write a $7 billion cheque. Building strong capacity in these markets is an expensive affair; Idea has to use its resources judiciously and direct them to markets where it has a high share, says an analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage firm. To be sure, Idea Cellulars investments in the remaining 17 circles are even higher than those of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone India Ltd. In the above-mentioned five markets, Idea Cellular has a relatively low market share, which means that its customers in these markets generate low Arpu (average revenue per user) and are unlikely to use 4G services anytime soon. As such, the firms strategy in these markets appears to be to compete largely in the low-end of the market, with some broadband capacity to cater to those who want to upgrade. Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd have acquired significant capacity in these markets, which will result in faster connectivity as well as the ability to handle large volumes of data. High Arpu customers will naturally gravitate to one of these companies. A moot question from Idea Cellulars perspective is if there is a business case at all to continue investing in these markets. Operating in the low-end of the market is a low-margin business, which will get further compressed with the ongoing fall in tariffs after Reliance Jios launch. That Idea sees the possibility of building a business case in these circles at some point is a bold assumption, but gritty bold moves are not new to the company, Kotaks analysts say in their note. Vodafone India , despite the $7 billion cheque from its parent company, decided to stay without either 3G or 4G capacity in five marketsAndhra Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir. These markets account for 19% of the industrys revenues, and about 9.5% of  the companys revenue.

The discount retailer Target Corp. opened its own Target Open House showroom a year ago in San Francisco. Shoppers walk through a futuristic home, watching prerecorded displays projected onto its transparent acrylic walls and furniture.In the nursery, a baby wears a Wi-Fi onesie -- made by a company called Mimo, founded by whizzes from MIT. It tracks the infants breathing, skin temperature, sleep and body position. When she stirs, it triggers the homes lights, turns on soothing music on the Sonos wireless speakers and even tells the coffee maker downstairs to start brewing java for red-eyed parents.You can pick one up for $199. Many parents brew the coffee themselves and let their babies wail -- or buy a traditional baby monitor for as little as $19.99. Connected home devices can cost five times the price of the old-fashioned version, according to Target spokeswoman Jenna Reck.The smart home will get there but its not there yet, Reck said. Adoption is happening even slower than people predicted.Disobedient DevicesAs with all things tech, there is the matter of glitches, frustration and complexity. Markus Giesler, 40, equipped his 1924 house with an Apple home system so he could be a subject for his own academic research at the Schulich School of Business at York University in Canada.When the associate professor of marketing pulls up to the house in his BMW, the GPS on his phone alerts the garage door to open and turns on lights in various colors and brightness throughout his home, depending on his preferences and the time of day. At least, in theory, they do.Certain devices obey, and some do not, Giesler said.Homebuilders started offering smart devices such as automatic locks and thermostats more than five years ago. In its current model homes, Miami-based Lennar works with a company called Nexia, a unit of Ingersoll-Rand Plc.Lennars Kaiserman hopes working with Apple will have a halo effect, helping convince customers that a new home in a subdivision can be a cool alternative to an existing one.No doubt, Apple would be heartened by the experience of Ken Bieber. Last year, Bieber, a 39-year-old executive at a consulting firm, bought a $357,000 Lennar smart home after visiting a model north of Tampa, Florida.With his Nexia system, his lights automatically start dimming in the evening, signaling that its time to get ready for bed. When his wife, April, went into labor two months ago, he stayed with her in the hospital and texted a temporary entry code to a friend who walked the dog.Since buying his house, Bieber has spent another $1,000 for wireless motion detectors, a video camera and controls for his light dimmers, ceiling fans and irrigation system.Neighbors ask him for advice on their own smart home device purchases, and he plans to add motorized blinds. Ill be watching a movie and suddenly I have to get up and pull blinds -- apparently its just too much for me at that point, Bieber said. Im so used to saying things and they just happen. BloombergWith assistance from Alex Webb",2016-10-19,W9kvhREszSoZo4H8q8LS4L,"As iPhone sales growth slows, Apple is teaming up with a handful of builders to inch its way into the market for Internet-connected home furnishings",competitor,22:14,Apple wants to get inside your home before you even buy it

				In early 2009, NTT Docomo invested Rs14,500 crore ($2.2 billion) in an Indian wireless business on the understanding that if certain targets werent met in five years, its partner, Mumbai-based Tata Group, would either find a buyer for the Japanese companys 26.5% stake at fair market value, or would take over those shares at half the original value of the investment, whichever was higher. When Docomo decided to exercise the option in April 2014, there was no taker for the unprofitable operations, so the Tatas sought central bank permission to pay out the equivalent of Rs7,250 crore.By then, however, the Reserve Bank of India had a new set of rules that banned any exit by a foreign equity investor at an assured price. Still, the central bank, under Governor Raghuram Rajan, wanted to allow the payment because it was a question of an Indian company honouring an agreement, struck at a time when there was no clear law against options embedded in such an investment. Also, this clearly wasnt a case of foreign-currency debt masquerading as equity. How many creditors agree in advance to a 50% haircut after five years? Yet the Indian government, which had the final say, decided the Tatas shouldnt be allowed to pay Docomo.In January 2015, Docomo took the dispute to the London Court for International Arbitration. Last month, the court awarded the Japanese firm $1.17 billion (Rs7,840 crore at the current rate) in compensation from Tata Sons, the Indian conglomerates holding company.The saga should have ended there, except that:Bloomberg News reports that New Delhi intends to block the arbitration payment, too; Japans Nikkei says Docomo might ask a US court to seize Tata assets; The Financial Times has learned from a person close to Docomo that the Japanese company might seek enforcement action on Tata Groups British businesses; and The Tata Group is countering that the struggling Port Talbot steel plant in south Wales, as well as UK-based Jaguar Land Rover, are owned by Tata Steel and Tata Motors  theyre not Tata Sons properties. So the whole thing has become a spectacle. The Indian governments refusal to take a commonsense view of Docomos claim was a poor decision. New Delhi is now making bad judgment worse by threatening to block the arbitration award.Such actions have consequences. Not only has the governments pigheadedness created unnecessary risks for minority shareholders of publicly traded Tata Steel and Tata Motors, it has also cast doubts on Prime Minister Narendra Modis resolve to change investors experience of doing business in India. The Docomo debacle is the depth of dumb.

-1.0,"Hero MotoCorp Ltds margin beat for the June quarter is impressive, especially given the trend of rising input costs. Operating margin at 16.6% is not only 153 basis points higher than the year-ago period, but it also whizzed past Bloomberg estimates of 15.7%. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
				   
				What did the trick was a 6% increase in the companys sales volumes, although net realization was unexpectedly only a tad better compared with a year ago. Including other operating income, net revenue rose by 7.2% to Rs.7,398.9 crore, which however, was lower than Bloomberg estimates.Higher volumes and a good product mix with higher growth in scooter sales compared with motorcycles helped profitability. Raw material cost per unit of vehicles sold was lower than a year back. Add to this a drop in other expenses, perhaps on the back of contained advertising expenses.On the whole, improved profitability translated into Rs.1,230.1 crore of operating profit, higher by 18% from the year-ago period and also better than what the Street expected.The markets gave a thumbs up to the robust operating performance. Hero MotoCorps stock closed a tad higher at Rs.3,456.80. But analysts will have their eyes set on sales volumes in the forthcoming months. In the analysts conference call, the management reiterated that given the good monsoon, a rural revival should aid motorcycle sales. Meanwhile, urbanization and the hike in salaries should lift scooter sales too in urban areas, although the growth rate may slow as the base gets higher. Hero MotoCorps net profit of Rs.883 crore for the quarter too was above expectations and 18% higher than a year back.Strong sales would obviously trickle down into better profits for the company. But the big challenge would be rising input costs. In spite of this, if Hero MotoCorp lives up to its guidance of sustained profitability, there could be a re-look at earnings growth estimates.For now, the stock trades at around 20 times one-year forward estimated earnings per share, which is reasonable given the strong profit growth.

-0.16,"Life just got complicated for those who had rested their case for a prolonged bear market in iron ore. Falling iron ore prices have reversed swiftly and Mondays 19% increase surprised everyone. Even if this is a blip, it is no ordinary one as iron ore prices have gained 46% so far this year. Fundamentals have not changed though. Here are five reasons why the case for a sustained increase in iron ore prices does not seem convincing yet:
				   
				1. Globally, commodity prices are enjoying a reprieve from a punishing decline, with crude oil leading from the front. There are no visible reasons underpinning this recovery, making some wonder if this will continue. If global commodities resume their decline, then iron ore is likely to follow suit.2. One prime reason why iron ore prices had been falling is an increase in mined output at a time when the global outlook for steel was weak. There is no change in the situation. Large miners have deferred future capex plans but are looking to finish building factories where money is already sunk. All said, rising iron ore output remains a threat.3. Chinas weak economic outlook was another reason for depressed iron ore prices. Recently declared economic growth targets for 2016 and the next five years, and indications that the Chinese government will support growth, appear to have been taken at face value. Tuesday provided a reality check: Chinas exports in February fell by 25.4%.4. As of January, steel output trends based on the World Steel Associations data do not indicate a trend reversal, especially in China. Heres a twist. A Reuters report dated 7 March says steel mills in Tangshan, China may have to limit output between 29 April and 16 October, to lower air pollution to facilitate a horticultural event. Tangshan is a top steel producing region. The fear is that steel plants may produce more now to stock up for the period when production will be slack. This in turn may lead to higher demand for iron ore and, therefore, higher prices now, but wont be enough to support prices for more than a few months.5. Global steel demand continues to be weak. Chinas steel exports have been flooding global markets prompting countries to take anti-dumping measures. Two factors can reverse this flood; Chinas domestic steel demand recovers or it limits steel output through permanent measures such as shutting down plants. A demand recovery in other major economies too could be a trigger. Till that happens, it is difficult to accept that this iron ore rally has legs made of steel.For the moment, higher iron ore prices and the resultant likely increase in steel prices bode well both for miners and steel companies.

				Bengaluru-based Wipro does not give an annual forecast (it provides quarterly guidance) and for this reason, it has clarified that this should not be interpreted as a target.Still, Wipro, which over the last few years has struggled to keep pace with its larger rivals, believes that measures taken since February this year to generate more business from existing clients, investments in building capabilities in new technologies, such as cloud computing platforms and Internet of things, and an aggressive mergers and acquisitions (M&A) strategy should help it get to industry-matching growth.Im always careful of putting a timeline and so I believe it is not unreasonable to expect this industry-matching growth number by March 2018, Neemuchwala said in an interview on Friday.I feel very confident and I see that green shoots (are) coming in a more sustainable manner.

Wipros large rivals, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd, run the risk of slower growth this year than the 7.1% and 9.1% growth recorded last year. To be sure, some of the early signs of the measures taken have started reflecting well, with the company improving its ability to generate more business from existing clients, and arresting declining profitability.Wipro has managed to improve average revenue per client to about $6.6 million at the end of September from $6 million at the start of the financial year in April.The firm managed to hold on to a 17.8% operating margin, same as during the April-June period, despite giving salary raises to close to 174,000 employees during the July-September period. Wipros margins had narrowed sharply after it reported 19.7% profitability in the March quarter. Wipros muted 0-2% QoQ dollar revenue growth guidance for third quarter is a disappointment and belies hopes for a turnaround in the core business.

It stands at the intersection of the start-up, academic, corporate, research and government sectors, and Yes Bank.In April 2016, Yes Bank signed a memorandum of understanding  with T-Hub to create a centre of excellence (CoE), to enable the Indian start-ups across segments with primary focus on fintech. This association will help create a conducive business environment and support system for a large number of fintech start-ups. In addition, Yes Bank will offer its various products and payment gateways and open application program interfaces (APIs) to the start-up community. This challenge tasked the worlds finest minds to create an innovation strategy to leverage the relationship between Yes Bank and T-Hub and to create a holistic innovation program for fintech start-ups, as well as to create a detailed marketing strategy and implementation programme to promote the CoE initiative in a cluttered and highly competitive market.Zaggle In case 3, the focus shifted to Zaggle one of Indias fastest growing prepaid card companies with over 1,000 corporates and 600,000 cards (Visa/Master/proprietary platform) in circulation.Yes Bank and Zaggle have entered into an association to offer prepaid cards to Yes Bank customers. Zaggle has aligned itself with Yes Bank as a total solution provider for its prepaid instruments services across India. This collaboration formally marked Zaggles first engagement with Yes Bank to issue prepaid gift cards and subsequently follow it up with other prepaid cards and allied products with respect to digital payments. This collaboration with Yes Bank would enable Zaggle to further cement its position as a leader in the digital payments space.The case challenged the students to device a cashless innovative pre-paid solution for individuals, giving employers a hassle free product construct and the recipient a potent solution with a wide bouquet of options along with a focused marketing strategy.EzetapThere has been much talk about the gradual shift to a cashless society and the fourth case in the Yes Bank Transformation Series focused on that. This case was shared by Ezetapthe fastest growing mPoS company in India today. Since launching in 2011, Ezetap has over 80,000 terminals deployed in the market, processing over $2.5 million in gross transaction value daily.Despite the phenomenal growth of mobile wallet and m-PoS providers in the country, there is a still major reliance on cash transactions (almost 94% transactions are cash-based). Bright young minds across the world were tasked with devising a strategic road map for Ezetap to tap this huge potential market (there is a potential of 19-20 million PoS  terminals in India while currently only around a million exist). Students were also advised to integrate the revolutionary UPIUnified Payment Interface technology.Campus connectAfter a gruelling opening round, the top five teams were identified by senior leaders from the partner organizations and Yes Bank leaders. The Yes Bank Transformation Series hosted campus challenges across the top 25 campuses in the country to identify the 15 finalist teams of the challenge. The campus round saw students ideas being judged on criteria such as research methodology, understanding of current regulatory framework, depth of analysis of core issues, innovation quotient, and feasibility of implementation and scalability.Apart from naming the winners and runners-up in the campus round, additional prizes were given away for the most innovative idea, most implementable solution, best marketing plan, and Y-Star presenter. This year saw a number of online engagements that generated a huge buzz in the student community. For instance, prior to the campus rounds, teams that submitted their entries before 21 August were eligible for the early-bird submission prize. There was also a Cheatcode Day, through which the top five winners got the opportunity to have their queries addressed by the case-study partner.Students were equally ecstatic about the competition and shared their feedback. Said Janaki Thakkar, student at IIM, Ahmedabad: This year, the theme was around Innovation and National Impact, and the case study we received was a live project Yes Bank was working on. This made the competition appealing, knowing that our work would add value to the organization, and hence we decided to participate. Of course, the attractive prizes helped! Since we worked on a live problem statement at Yes Bank Transformation Series, the competition gave us an opportunity to apply our classroom learnings to real world scenarios. Further, this competition helped us in exploring the current trends across various sectors and keep us informed about recent developments in the business world. While working on this case, we not only looked into developing marketing plan for the target group but also multiple use-cases that would add value to the customers. Says Pramod Suresh of ISB Hyderabad: The transformation series was a challenging competition which required the use of both our left and right brains to arrive at creative yet logical solutions to an actual problem. Yes Bank and T-Hubs brand ensured that there would be stiff competition. The competition exposed us to the accelerator and fintech ecosystem. It also pushed us to think on new disruptive business models. We also got a holistic exposure into various facets of business and also helped polish the soft skills.According to Rashmi Yadawad of IIM, Calcutta: A competition like Yes Bank Transformation Series gives me an opportunity to know about this in detail and stay updated with the current industries and trends. Apart from knowing about current industries and trends, direct interactions with officials from Yes Bank and Ezetap gave me insights from their perspective, a direct picture of what they have already tried. Competing with the campus winners across different B-school campuses will also give me more learnings and the fire to give my best!The grand finaleIn a first-of-its-kind collaboration, the ministry of new and renewable energy, Government of India, shared a challenge focusing on popularizing solar energy with the 15 finalist teams. The final case study will provide a gruelling test to Indias future business leaders. After proving their worth in real-life business cases, the finale takes them to uncharted territories as they pit their wits on a challenge of national importance. The final case challenges finalists to provide innovative financial solutions for solar, or photovoltaic, installations while also creating a strategy for solar consumer products.India is now at a juncture when we must turn to solar to power our future. The government is fully committed to boosting generation and use of solar energy and aims to add 1,00GW of solar power by 2022. The non-polluting nature of solar energy further underlines its status as the most preferred fuel. We must look to integrate solar energy with the lives of the common Indian by making it cheaper, more reliable and easier to connect to grid. High quality research, technological advancements and innovative financing solutions are the means to ensure solar energy becomes affordable and accessible to all. In this regard, I am happy to note that the Yes Bank Transformation Series will see teams from top B-schools in India offering innovative and path breaking ideas regarding the future growth of solar as a medium of energy. I look forward to receiving some valuable insights and suggestions from the sharp young brains and wish them all the best, said A.K. Tripathi, adviser, ministry of new and renewable energy.The grand finale will be held in New Delhi on 16 and 17 November, where the finalists will get to present their ideas to a jury comprising industry experts and mentors. To kick off the final proceedings of the case challenge, Yes Bank will conduct a curtain-raiser on 16 November in New Delhi, where the final 15 teams will get the opportunity to fine-tune their solutions with the advisory council. They will also get to hear the success stories of some of Indias most successful start-up founders as they prepare to start their own quest to entrepreneurship.On 17 November, the teams will present their solutions to the jury, who will pick three winning teams that present the most innovative ideas that can create an impact.

0.1,"Mumbai: The board of Tata Sons Ltd on Monday replaced Cyrus P. Mistry as chairman, less than four years after he took the helm, and named his predecessor Ratan Tata interim chairman for four months.
				   
				The board of the group holding company did not specify a reason for the abrupt move, which was announced after markets closed.Tata Sons in its collective wisdom and on the recommendations of the principal shareholders decided that it may be appropriate to consider a change for the long-term interest of Tata Sons and Tata group, a spokesperson said. A selection committee comprising Ratan Tata, Venu Srinivasan, Amit Chandra, Ronen Sen and Kumar Bhattacharyya was given the mandate of finding a replacement for Mistry, 48, who became chairman of the $103 billion conglomerate in December 2012, at the end of Tatas over two-decade tenure at the top. The board was given four months to complete the task. In the interim, the board has requested me to perform the role of chairman and I have agreed to do so in the interest of and reassurance to the Tata group, Ratan Tata, 78, said in a statement addressed to colleagues.ALSO READ | Uneasy lies the Tata crownThe development, which portends at least short-term turmoil, comes at a time when the conglomerate, whose business interests range from tea to telecom and salt to software services, has been trying to recast or dispose of the key UK steel business, which it acquired in a $12.9 billion purchase of Corus Group Plc. in 2007 under Ratan Tata.This is quite an unusual situation, unexpected from a group like Tata which stands for its values. This means there could possibly have been some governance issue or some major disagreement with either the style of functioning or decision that Mistry may have taken, said Kavil Ramachandran, professor and executive director at the Thomas Schmidheiny Centre for Family Enterprise at the Indian School of Business.According to a person aware of the development, the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, of which Mistry is a scion and which is estimated to hold an 18% stake in Tata Sons, is protesting the move, paving the ground for what could be a messy battle. About two-thirds of Tata Sons is held by philanthropic trusts such as the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Mistry will continue as a Tata Sons director, the spokesperson cited earlier said. However, the group executive council (GEC), a brainchild of Mistrys, has been disbanded, said a person aware of the development. The GEC page has been pulled down from Tata Sons website as has Mistrys September interview to the in-house magazine in which he stated his views on some of the underperforming companies in the group. Our individual companies need to earn the right to grow, he said in the interview.The boardroom putsch has been some time in the making, according to a person close to Mistry, who asked not to be identified. Differences have surfaced over how Mistry has been dealing with the significant challenges facing the group.Several of Mistrys operational decisions were challenged by Ratan Tata, according to this person. Still, it is the prerogative of the largest shareholder to do this, the person said a few weeks ago. Mint couldnt ascertain if there was an immediate trigger for this ouster.Primarily, it was a lack of communication between the shareholder and the management. A lot of decision-making was done unilaterally by Tata Sons and was not approved by Tata Trusts, said another person briefed about the matter.Among the six chairmen Tata Sons has had so far in its history, Mistrys is the shortest tenure at just short of four years.ALSO READ | Ratan Tata says intolerance a curse we are seeing of lateSince taking over, Mistry has repeatedly talked about continuing to seize business opportunities, especially in emerging technologies.

-0.49,"Infosys Ltd has lagged peers on revenue and profit growth in six of the past seven years. But even when its competitive position rapidly deteriorated, it held on to the pole position for one important metriccash flow generation.
				   
				In the past seven years, cash flow from operations amounted to 23.3% of revenues for Infosys, compared to 19.8% in the case of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and 16.2% for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. But, as is well known, Infosys has lagged considerably in terms of shareholder returns during this period. Cash may be king, but it is clearly no emperor. Investors far prefer strong growth accompanied by a reasonable amount of cash generation to exceptional cash generation accompanied by sluggish growth.Is TCS now falling into the same trap? Its growth rate has fallen considerably and cash flow generation has improved in recent years. It has closed the gap with Infosys considerably in terms of cash generated from operations19.3% of revenues in FY16 versus 19.6% for Infosys. Besides, it has curtailed capital expenditure. As a result, it has overtaken Infosys in free cash flow generation in the past two years. The amount spent by TCS on capital expenditure and acquisitions accounted for just 12.5% of cash flow from operations in the past two years, compared to 28.7% in the case of Infosys.Should investors be worried? According to an analyst with a multinational brokerage firm, the company has chosen the organic route to invest for the future, compared to some of its peers who have preferred acquisitions to plug gaps in their portfolio. Analysts at JPMorgan India Pvt. Ltd said in note to clients after attending an 18 March analysts meet, We came away with an enhanced appreciation of TCSs digital capabilities and conclude that its lack of M&A in digital does not necessarily mean lack of capabilityit is strongly building the needed, differentiating digital strengths organically.Another reason cash flow generation has improved in recent years is that the company has reduced its exposure to some emerging markets such as India. Working capital needs are typically higher in these regions, and the lower exposure has meant that overall cash generation has improved. Both of the above points suggest that growth isnt necessarily being sacrificed. Of course, it remains to be seen if TCSs plan to grow organically helps it catch up with peers soon.Thankfully for Infosyss shareholders, its new leadership has made growth a priority. The company even beat TCS on revenue growth in fiscal year 2015-16. M&A (mergers and acquisitions) activity has picked up, indicating that it is getting bolder with its use of cash. And cash flow from operations fell to below 20% of revenues last year, compared to around 24% in the preceding three years. Perhaps TCS too needs to take a cue and loosen its purse strings to position itself better for growth ahead.",2016-06-06,WqzMn5tlnCsvdd76ErxdGL,"Infosys has witnesses strong cash flow generation, but has lagged considerably in terms of shareholder returns.

-0.88,"New Delhi: Indias demand for green energy is expected to grow by seven times in 2035, according to the latest BP Energy Outlook released on Wednesday.
				   
				Accordingly, the share of renewable energy in the countrys fuel mix will increase from the present level of 2% to 8% in 2035. However, the green surge will be inadequate to meet Indias growing need for energy with the countrys demand growth expected to be more than double the non-OECD countries average of 52%.OECD countries refer to the 35 nations that are signatories to the Convention on the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, and mostly comprise mature economies.This comes in the backdrop of investors seeing enormous opportunity in Indias emerging green economy. India, the worlds third largest energy consuming economy after the US and China, plans to achieve 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022 as part of its commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted by 195 countries in Paris in December 2015.The global energy landscape is changing. Traditional centers of demand are being overtaken by fast-growing emerging markets. The energy mix is shifting, driven by technological improvements and environmental concerns. More than ever, our industry needs to adapt to meet those changing energy needs, said Bob Dudley, BP group chief executive in a statement.According to the report, an annual feature published by British energy firm BP Plc, the growth in Indias energy demand is expected to outpace the other so-called BRIC (Brazil, Russia, China, India) countries. Indias energy demand is expected to grow by 129%, while China and Brazils energy demand will grow by 47% and 41%, respectively. Russias energy demand is expected to grow by 2%.Indias energy consumption is expected to grow by 4.2% annually, faster than all major economies in the world. As a result, Indias share of global energy demand will increase to 9% by 2035, accounting for the second largest share among the BRIC countries with China at 26%, Russia at 4%, and Brazil at 2%.Coal remains the dominant fuel produced in India with a 65% share of total production in 2035. Renewables overtakes oil as the second largest, increasing from 4% to 14% in 2035 as oil drops from 10% today to 3% by 2035, the report said.In India, which is the biggest greenhouse gas emitter after the US and China, renewable energy currently accounts for 15%, or 45,917 MW, of the total installed capacity of 3,10,005 MW. According to the government, India has a renewable energy potential of around 900 GW from sources such as wind, solar, small hydro and bio energy.The National Democratic Alliance governments focus on renewable energy stems from Indias energy import bill of around $150 billion, expected to reach $300 billion by 2030. India imports around 80% of its crude oil and 18% of its natural gas requirements. The government aims to effect a 10% cut in energy imports by 2022 and a 50% cut by 2030. India imported 202 million tonnes of oil in 2015-16.According to BP Energy Outlooks prediction, Indias oil imports are expected to rise by 165%, followed by a 173% and 105% increase in gas and coal imports respectively. Energy in transport grows by 5.8% per year and oil remains the dominant fuel source with a 93% market share in 2035, the report added.",2017-01-27,WtZZpEdwb01T6g9uAF0nsM,"The clean energy surge will, however, be inadequate to meet Indias growing need for energy with the countrys demand growth",both,08:58,Renewables to overtake Indias oil output in 2035: BP Energy Outlook 
-0.5,"Unlike group firms Adani Enterprises Ltd and Adani Power Ltd, transmission assets owner Adani Transmission Ltd has proved to be a good bet for investors. Despite the volatility, the stock gained 45% in the last one year. Last week it saw another bout of gains after the company said it agreed to buy three transmission line assets from Reliance Infrastructure Ltd, priced at around Rs1,900 crore.
				   
				The agreement comes on the back of two transmission line buys from GMR Energy Ltd for an equity value of around Rs100 crore. The latest acquisition from Reliance Infrastructure has an equity portion of Rs400-500 crore, with the rest Rs1,500 crore being debt that will be transferred to Adani Transmission. Last fiscal year, the company generated an Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of Rs1,863 crore. Roughly half of this was spent on finance costs, leaving the company with a net profit of Rs357 crore. Net cash flows from operations were at Rs1,581 crore.So, given the cash flows, analysts expect Adani Transmission to comfortably close the deal. Further, the transmission revenue for all three assets are collected by a central government-owned utility as a part of a pooling mechanism. This reduces the counter-party risks and helps derive better ratings for its debt instruments, which is important as Adani Transmission is highly dependent on borrowed money.Three global ratings agencies have said that the deal will not affect the companys current rating. With the assets operational and generating revenue, they do not expect the acquisition to weaken the current financial position of Adani Transmission. Fitch estimates that EBITDA contribution from the assets will be sufficient to keep Adani Transmissions financial leverage, as measured by gross debt to EBITDA, at less than 5x in the medium term, Fitch Ratings Singapore Pte Ltd said in a note.What ratings agencies are wary about is the financial leeway for the company. Post the acquisition, Adani Transmission will be left with little financial elbow room, be it for liquidity or for contingencies. While the company itself is in capex mode (building five new lines), it is lapping up assets from the market. We believe the current rating level can accommodate the acquisition although it would leave no headroom for any further material cash outflow, said S&P Global Ratings.Another ratings agency warns that the acquisition is credit negative and leaves little scope for ratings improvement, which could have helped the company refinance or raise funds at even cheaper rates. Further it warned of a downgrade. Adani Transmissions rating could be downgraded if it undertakes aggressive expansion, or if revenues from non-transmission business rise consistently above 25% of total revenues, said Moodys Investors Service Singapore Pte Ltd. On the other hand, the ratings are unlikely to be upgraded in the near term, based on the companys business profile and financial strategy.That said, Adani Transmissions finances are no reason for worry yet. But further loading of balance sheet with acquisitions can diminish the scarcity appeal the stock is enjoying right nowthere are few listed stocks in the transmission sector, which is known to offer steady earnings.",2016-10-10,WvY0tZGKxUh2FWx3xqBebI,"Further loading of balance sheet with acquisitions can diminish the scarcity appeal the Adani Transmission stock is enjoying right nowthere are few listed stocks in the sector, which is known to offer steady earnings",competitor,00:34,Adani Transmission: Scarcity appeal

We lost out on the industrial revolution, we lost out on the defence revolutionlets not lose out in the cyber revolution.ALSO READ: How AI may help you write your new bookWhile other countries have long relied on AI to gather intelligence, Indiasometimes seemingly addicted to paperworkhas continued to use agents to eyeball reams of data gathered over the years. Its a process that sucks up time and can often miss crucial information.India has been in three wars with its neighbours since independence and the target of numerous cross-border attacks, including in 2008 when Pakistan-based extremists killed more than 160 people in Mumbai. Now the threat from cyber attacks is growing and its vulnerability has been exposed.Some 22,000 pages of data related to submarines that a French government-owned company was building for the Indian navy were leaked to the media last year.Opposition leader Rahul Gandhis Twitter account was hacked in November while the elite National Security Guards website was reportedly defaced with profanity-laden messages for Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month.Our idea starting out was that if the next war is fought on cyber, we need our own weapons, said Wig as he talks through software developed for Indias needs. Innefu got a foot in the lucrative business of government contracts after resolving a thorny test case for a law enforcement agency that wanted to determine the background to an incident along one of Indias borders.The agency handed over two CDs with about 1,500 intelligence documents, including social media snippets, such as posts on planned protests. Innefu had to train the machine to read the agencys language, including abbreviations, and then began extracting information on what happened, who were the main players and how they interacted with each other.Its newest offering Prophecy is modelled on products made by Palantir Technologies, a private security firm whose founders include Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel and whose clientele includes the CIA and the FBI. Prophecy is like an octopus with multiple tentacles that pulls data from multiple places, said Wigs co-founder Abhishek Sharma.ALSO READ: AI pioneer Juergen Schmidhuber wants to build the renaissance machine of the futureWhile the use of AI is commonplace elsewhere in Asia, it is still in its infancy in India. About 75% of respondents to a recent survey by consulting firm EY India said cybersecurity deployed in their organisations does not meet their needs, pointing to big opportunities for companies such as Innefu.Although Innefu is the only Indian company known to specialise in national security, other Indian companies such as Arya.ai and Haptik are also tapping what should be a lucrative market. Banks have started to use AI to target products to customers and doctors are using it in a couple of experiments to map a patients medical history in order to devise new lines of treatment.Work is also underway to create a system that can act as a backbone for all electronic warfare programmes for the Indian army. But most of this is still at the laboratory stage, experts say.Its expensive and our society is not used to automated decision-making, Jiten Jain, chief of Indian Infosec Consortium, an industry body, told AFP. Were still used to manual and human decision-making. Subimal Bhattacharjee, a cyber security expert, said India had been caught off guard by the need to upscale its use of AI.We are definitely laggards in comparison to China and South Korea and the US, he said.Innefu operates from the eighth floor of a nondescript Delhi commercial complex that houses chartered accountants and eateries. Its windows are darkened with thick black paper, while clusters of wires sprout from walls adorned with photos of goddess Lakshmi, the purveyor of wealth.But despite its humble surroundings, it is confident an ongoing trial of Prophecy will lead to more business with Indias security serviceswhom Wig expects to be naturally inclined to go local. You cant really trust such sensitive data with foreign companies, said Wig.",2017-01-22,WySodQJkun7yBQl7XTA0JL,"While other countries have long relied on AI to gather intelligence, India has continued to use agents to eyeball reams of data gathered over the years",competitor,17:55,India turns to artificial intelligence as cyber warfare threats grow

				Rapid expansion helped the firm build a brand and scale up during the boom phase in real estate, but size has become its bane now.Small doses of positive news on the sales of non-core assets may have helped support the stock at lower levels. But this has done little to ease the balance sheet pressure and improve operating cash flows for the firm. Consolidated net debt has risen from Rs8,526 crore in  FY14 to Rs22,120 crore at the end of June 2016.Paring this down further requires sales recovery, which is not happening at the desired pace. In spite of news about a slow improvement in the residential real estate market, DLFs  June quarter net sales fell by 21% over a year ago. That was way below what the Street had forecasted.A look at relevant sales parameters over the last eight quarters shows how bad the situation is. The sales pickup is not enough to ease cash flow stress in the near term. Quarterly sales booked have been consistently low at 0.2-0.9 million sq. ft. with a downward bias. In fact, the June quarter had no sales from existing completed projects. On the other hand, Rs270 crore worth of legacy bookings were cancelled.Add to this the huge closing balance of existing projects. Although this has been reducing, DLFs June quarter closing balance was 21.9 million sq. ft. The balance sheet for FY16 pegs the inventory at Rs17,000 crore, which is a grave concern as it is nearly twice the annual sales (including lease income of commercial assets).Perhaps, the main issue is that the National Capital Region, where DLF has a major exposure, is saddled with huge inventory. The company is left holding a massive land bank in a region which may not be of much use in current conditions.According to Santosh Yellapu, senior research analyst (infrastructure) at Angel Broking Pvt. Ltd , DLFs problem is that its residential project operations are faced with negative cash flows. The firm is, perhaps due to regulatory fears, now focusing on completing and delivering existing legacy projects than launching new ones. While this is good, it eats into its cash flows.Meanwhile, investors are patiently waiting for promoters to sell a stake in DLF Cyber City Developers Ltd. The stock gained about 33% since April on this news.

The boards of HDFC Life and Max in August had signed a three way merger, which would create Indias largest private-sector insurer with total assets more than Rs1.1 trillion and lead to the eventual listing of HDFC Life on stock exchanges.Post the merger Housing Development Finance Corp.

However, the company refutes the same in the BSE disclosure Max said that the scheme of merger or amalgamation is in compliance with law. (company) believes that the scheme of arrangement as submitted to the IRDAI is in compliance with all applicable laws and proposes to represent and clarify the matter to IRDAI, said the statement on BSE.

Basically, Irdai wants to ensure that the merger is happening between two life insurance companies only , I.e HDFC Life and MAX Life. Since it is a three step merger process and Max Financial Services, which is an NBFC, is also involved in the scheme, Irda wants to ensure that at no stage any amalgamation is happening between Max Financial and any insurance company. So we have to clarify and disclose to Irdai that the non-insurance businesses , such as the telecom business, of MAX Financial Services will be first demerged into Max India and then only the life insurance business of Max Life will be effectively transferred completely to Max Financial Services and subsequently it will be merged with HDFC Life which will result in the automatic listing of the merged entity said a person involved in the merger process on condition of anonymity. Irda had sought the views and recommendation of solicitor general of India a week back and the latest step by Irda has been taken accordingly it seems.

-0.82,"The March-quarter earnings of auto firms indicated two trends. One is the better-than-expected revenue growth. Two, and more important, is the peaking out of profit margins.
				   
				The revenues of auto firms grew on the back of better volumes for some firms such as Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, the market leader in utility vehicles. The quarters sales picked up after a lull for many quarters. Likewise, the benefits of high demand for medium and heavy commercial vehicles was seen in Tata Motors Ltd, Ashok Leyland Ltd and Eicher Motors Ltd.In some cases, a better product mix and lower discounts propped up revenue, as in the case of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.Two-wheeler firms, too, surprised positively as demand rose across the board. On the whole, rural demand inched up and robust urban sales brought down discounts. Passenger car firms lured customers with new launches, too.Meanwhile, the March-quarter operating margins expanded 100-200 basis pointsone basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage pointfor most auto firms, thanks to low raw material costs. But then, this is unlikely to continue. Commodity prices are up from a year ago, though volatile in the last few months. Steel prices, for instance, are up 6% from a year ago. This is not all. Going ahead, there are likely to be more refreshes and new launches from original equipment makers, both in cars and two-wheelers. The need is to capture market share and grow sales. This will continue to keep advertising spends high, as has been the case in the quarters gone by. These developments point to peaking profitability unless sales rally so much that the economics of higher capacity utilization pan out in favour of better margins. Much, of course, depends on the monsoon and recovery in export markets, too. Some firms such as Bajaj Auto Ltd had faced challenges in export markets.Investors in auto stocks are quick to jump on to the bandwagon when they spot the up cycle. This time around, the question is whether the stock valuation will sustain at current levels, which are pretty high, given that margin expansion will be limited in the near term. Shares of Maruti, which is the market leader in cars and which has been an outperformer in the pack of listed firms, trade at a steep valuation of 25 times expected earnings. Other such as those of Ashok Leyland Ltd and Hero MotoCorp Ltd trade at valuations higher than their average price-to-earnings multiples. If anything, analysts peg hopes on Tata Motors, as recovery in the domestic standalone business is good news, while its UK subsidiary, Jaguar Land Rover Plc, continues to chip in with higher volume growth.For now, FY17 started on a positive note, with most segments posting double-digit sales growth.

				Earlier this month, Tata Realty and Infrastructure (TRIL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Sons set up in 2007, had expressed interest in taking 10% stake in Swan LNG Pvt. Ltd that is setting up the Floating and Regasification Unit (FSRU) near Jafrabad in Gujarat. In a stock exchange filing, Swan today said: Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Ltd (IFFCO) are willing to invest up to 10% of the equity in the project. Ahead of the move, the authorised share capital of Swan LNG Pvt Ltd has been increased from Rs5 lakh to Rs2,000 crore, Swan Energy said in a separate filing. Gujarat government had previously taken 26% equity the LNG project. The Gujarat government participation in the project was through Gujarat State Petronet Ltd and Gujarat Maritime Board jointly. State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) have already booked 60% of the capacity of 5 million tonnes a year LNG terminal. The three firms have signed an agreement to import 1 million tonnes per annum of their own liquefied natural gas (LNG) at the Swan terminal. Gujarat State Petroleum Corp Ltd (GSPC) too is in talks to take 1.5 million tonnes capacity in the FSRU. The companies hiring the capacity will bring their own LNG from abroad and pay Swan a tolling fee. Swan Energy is building the project in joint venture with Exmar of Belgium, which holds 38% stake in the project. Swan is targeting 2019 for commissioning of the one jetty-moored FSRU at Jafrabad. It plans to expand the capacity to 10 million tonnes through the deployment of a second FSRU. Last month Swan had in a regulatory filing stated that it has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Petronasr and Alpha Energy Ltd for development of 20 trillion cubic feet Sephied Baghun gas field in Iran at an investment of $615 million. The project, besides constructing infrastructure to put the field into production, would also involve building an offshore gas liquefaction facilities (OLNG) that will convert the gas into its liquid form (LNG) for transporting it in ships to consumption centres. Swan will offtake around one million tonnes per year of LNG produced by the OLNG, which will be delivered to the FSRU built by Swan in Gujarat, it had said on 14 December.",2017-01-30,XFUIGbUDdpzOYW6vCKE8yO,"Swan Energy is building the project in joint venture with Exmar of Belgium, which holds a 38% stake in the project",both,22:47,IFFCO eyes 10% stake in Swan Energys LNG terminal
-0.24,"Bengaluru: Indias bid to construct liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers locally under the Make in India plan has collapsed yet again, with state-run natural gas firm GAIL (India) Ltd scrapping a tenderthe second in less than two yearsto hire as many as nine new such ships from global fleet owners to transport gas from the US. 
				   
				Two Japanese-led consortiums had submitted bids before the 15 October deadline set by GAIL, which contended that the two groups had submitted deviations to the tender terms that were not permissible. The bidding groups want GAIL to spare them from paying huge penalties arising from potential non-performance of the Indian-built LNG tankersessentially they want GAIL to assume a larger share of the potential risks on locally built ships. The tender is closed, an official with one of the two bidding groups said, asking not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. It is no longer valid, he said, adding that the government could not decide on a request from GAIL on what to do with the deviations even after the bid validity was extended by a fortnight on 30 September. Confirming the development, a GAIL official said that the company would come out with a fresh tender to hire the ships but whether that will incorporate the stipulation to build part of the ships in India was yet to be decided. These issues are still being discussed, the official said, requesting anonymity. A spokesperson for GAIL could not immediately be reached for comment. A consortium of Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd (MOL)-Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha Ltd (NYK Line) and Mitsui and Co. Ltd and another group comprising Mitsubishi Corp.-Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd (K Line)-GasLog Ltd and Foresight Ltd applied for one of the most sought after shipping tenders globally. The contract, estimated to be worth $7 billion, involved hiring nine new LNG tankers for shipping 5.8 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa) of gas from the US. GAIL will not order the ships directly at shipyardsboth overseas and Indian. It plans to hire the LNG carriers from global fleet owners who will have to construct three of the nine tankers in India as part of the Make in India plan of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In todays market, it costs more than $200 million to build an LNG ship from scratch. Indias state-run Cochin Shipyard Ltd is the only local yard that has fulfilled the eligibility criteria set by GAIL to build the LNG tankers. It has signed a technology collaboration pact with South Koreas Samsung Heavy Industries Co. Ltd to build the LNG ships. It has also secured a licence from GTT, France, to use its patented Mark-III LNG containment systems. Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan told Parliament recently that the first tender issued in 2014 had to be scrapped because none of the qualified foreign shipyards were able to sign binding collaboration pacts with an Indian shipyard for transferring LNG shipbuilding technology when the deadline for submitting bids ended after three extensions. In the second round of tendering, seven of the top global LNG ship owners formed two separate consortia to put in bids. But there were differences between GAIL and the bidders on sharing of risks on Indian-built LNG carriers. The tender terms, according to the bidding groups, loaded all risks on Indian-built LNG ships on to them. GAIL, on its part, was not willing to assume those risks. Make in India can work if both GAIL and the government extend support to the fleet owners, said an executive associated with one of the bidding groups. Make in India is not only one partys headache. GAIL/government cannot say that you are getting business so you take all the risks for Make in India. It has to be a collaborative effort. The government, GAIL and lenders have to come together. You cannot treat a tender at par for LNG ships to be built at experienced South Korean yards and those to be built at an Indian yard for the first time. Wherever LNG carriers are built for the first time, strong support was extended by the governmentbe it in China, Korea or Japan. It does need the support of everybody, the executive said. A shipbuilding executive closely associated with the bidding process, however, said that the concerns raised by the bidding groups on Indian-built ships were unfounded. Cochin Shipyard would build the carriers based on design provided by Samsung Heavy Industries and LNG containment systems licensed from GTT. Hence, the perception on quality and risk concerns expressed by bidders are misplaced, the executive said. He too declined to be named.",2016-10-19,XO2IhWrfiTwYExqRR5OTwO,"Gail scraps LNG shipping tender, the second in less than two years, to hire as many as nine new such ships from global fleet owners to transport gas from the US",both,14:20,Gail scraps LNG shipping tender yet again

The curbs follow an agreement last year by Opec and other exporters to reduce supplies by a combined 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to prop up prices that remain at about half their mid-2014 levels.A Reuters survey this week found most key oil producers were sticking to the deal with compliance above 80 percent.

-0.2,"The most striking feature in ABB India Ltds June quarter results is that the management remains cautious in spite of turning out an encouraging performance.
				   
				A robust 35% jump in net profit to Rs.77 crore was in line with what the Street had chalked out. It came not just from lower raw material costs, as was the case with most manufacturers in the June quarter, but also from higher revenue. In fact, the management said that it was the best second quarter (the company has a calendar year-ending) in five years.Revenue traction was mainly from the discrete automation systems division, which comprises a fourth of the total revenue. Analysts say that a lot of this came from renewable energy. Meanwhile, even the power grids and the electrification products divisions clocked decent sales growth.Also, evidently ABBs focus on high technology and short-cycle products has started to pay off by way of better profitability. Operating margin, which came up to investors expectation, was only a tad higher than a year-ago at 8.1%. Within this, the electrification products division outperformed other businesses with a 330 basis point jump in margins compared with a year back. One basis point is 0.01%.Even order inflow during the quarter was 7.7% higher than a year ago. But perhaps, this was not enough to trigger enthusiasm. In the post-results conference call, the management stated that private sector capex is yet to look up even as capacity utilization and credit growth remain low.

Singapore gross refining margin (GRM), though lower on a year-on-year basis, has improved sequentially (see chart). Nevertheless, a better refining environment is expected to reflect in the December quarter numbers of Indian refining companies. GRM is a measure of the difference between the per barrel price of crude oil and the value of products distilled from it.
				   
				State-run oil marketing companies (OMCs)Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Indian Oil Corp. Ltdare expected to report a good quarter thanks to a recovery in GRMs and inventory gains. While we assume inventory gains (GRM $1-2 a barrel, marketing segment $1-1.5 a barrel), we think OMCs could surprise, pointed out Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd. OMC stocks have outperformed the BSE Sensex so far this fiscal year. Currently, they trade in the range of about 9-12 times estimated earnings for FY17.For Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), improvement in refining margins is expected to be set off to an extent against muted performance from its petrochemicals business. Analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd expect RILs earnings to be largely flat versus the September quarter. That is because, according to Jefferies, the companys GRM is likely to improve by a more modest $0.7 a barrel to $10.8 a barrel in the December quarter due to a five-week maintenance shutdown at one of its FCC (fluid catalytic cracking) units and sharper improvement in gasoline and fuel oil cracks relative to middle distillate cracks. Middle distillate products account for a relatively higher share of RILs product slate.Secondly, the companys blended petrochemical margin has been slightly lower last quarter. Further, the impact of currency demonetization needs to be watched on the petrochemicals segment. Management commentary on the telecom business and updates on downstream projects will be crucial for the RIL stock, which has underperformed the benchmark Sensex so far this fiscal year.Meanwhile, earnings of upstream oil companiesOil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd and Oil India Ltdare expected to benefit from the strength in crude oil prices. On the flip side, some of those gains are likely to be offset by the 18% cut in domestic gas price.

Longer term, the keen musician and expert on Indian financial markets faces the challenge of modernizing capital markets and institutions in a nation where as many as 600 million people dont have a bank account.Why a cashless economy is still a fantasy for IndiaAcharya will take a seat on the Indias newly formed Monetary Policy Committee, which has in the past two meetings voted unanimously to cut interest rates in October and then to hold rates in December  both decisions taking markets by surprise. Meanwhile, pressure is increasing on the central bank to counter the slowdown by easing monetary policy in coming months.Bad bank debtsIndia is at an exciting but challenging time, Acharya said in a statement last week released on the NYU Sterns website. As one of the worlds fastest growing economies, India has the massive potential to become an economic powerhouse.Acharya, described as an outstanding and prolific scholar by the Dean of NYU Stern, Peter Henry, has authored research papers and articles on subjects, from analyzing systemic risk in the European banking sector to the health of Indian state-run and private banks. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Acharya said the government should consider allowing healthier private sector banks to buy the branch networks of distressed state-run banks as a way of preventing bad loans from festering.Bad debts at Indian lenders, especially those in the dominant state-run sector, have climbed to a 14-year high, and are expected to rise further as an economic slowdown makes it harder for banks to recover loans.Markets expertThere is a recognition that Indias capital markets need development, said Shilan Shah, Singapore-based India economist at Capital Economics. Certainly with his expertise, we can look forward to further reforms in the marketplace.Bankers and analysts also expect the RBI to ramp up its faltering communication strategy after Acharya, who is described as affable by friends, takes charge. The RBI has come under increasing flak, with several ex-central bankers criticizing its approach.A cloak of secrecy continues to shroud Prime Minister Narendra Modis currency ban decision and that has led to a view that authorities were not prepared for such a move. With the RBI top-brass making only occasional appearances and choosing not to explain its many flip flops, concerns over the central banks independence have gained ground.The RBIs largely silent approach is not very judicious and only adds on to concerns about the government undermining its independence, said Priyanka Kishore, Singapore-based lead Asia economist at Oxford Economics. Acharyas appointment will be a breath of fresh air.

In fact, fuel costs as a percentage of revenue dropped to as low as 25%, 20.6% and 22.7%, respectively, for IndiGo, Jet Airways and SpiceJet. Whats more, lower fuel costs also enabled Jet Airways and SpiceJet to report a profit for the year as a whole, too.

-0.49,"In 2014, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi first placed solar energy at the core of the energy mix that would fuel Indias economic growth, scepticism abounded: how will the government deliver? Isnt the target of 100 gigawatts (GW) of solar energy, later revised to 175GW of renewable energy, by 2022, too ambitious? Also, isnt solar energy expensive? How will Indias poor afford it? Just about two years later, the answers are emergingslowly but steadily.
				   
				This past Friday, the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) called for bids to install 1GW of rooftop solar power projects on central government buildingsits largest tender yet in this segment. India is already home to the worlds largest single-location solar power plant which has been set up by the Adani Group at Kamuthi in Tamil Nadu. The 648 megawatts (MW) project, built in a record time of eight months, dislodged Californias 550MW Topaz Solar Farm in September to secure the top spot and propel India past the 10GW total capacity threshold. Indeed, huge advances have been made in the past few yearsin terms of solar energy specifically and renewable energy in general. According to a Bloomberg New Energy Finance report, the solar sector has had an impressive compound annual growth rate of 59% in the last four fiscal years and its installed capacity at the end of the FY2016 was pegged at 6.8GW. Similarly, the share of renewable energy in Indias total energy mix has also increased from 12.5% in FY2013 to 14.1% in FY2016. Yes, this also shows how fossil fuels still make up the majority of Indias energy basket but lets not ignore how quickly renewables are catching up. With a cumulative CAGR of 15%, renewables are growing at a faster rate than coal power plants, which are increasing at 12.5%. Now, place this against the backdrop of Indias large untapped renewable energy potentialaccording to the government-developed India Energy Security Scenarios, India can achieve 479GW of solar power and 410GW of wind power by 2047and it is possible to see how, if India plays its cards correctly,  solar and other forms of renewable energy may eventually drive economic growth. Specifically, India seems to be on track to achieve its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution, promised as part of the Paris pact to fight climate change, to get at least 40% of its total installed power from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030.In terms of pricing, SECI breached new frontiers yet again in November with a record low tariff offering of Rs3 per unit. The winning firm at the reverse auctionGurgaon-based Amplus Energy Solutions Pvt. Ltd, which will be installing a total of 14.5MW of solar rooftop plants across the countryhas promised these rates specifically for Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Puducherry. At one level, low tariff offering doesnt come as a surprisethis figure has been consistently falling since 2010 when it was pegged at Rs17.91 per unit; over the past few years, it had somewhat stabilized at about Rs5 per unit when the US-based SunEdison, one of the worlds largest renewable energy firms and which has now filed for bankruptcy protection, shook up the market in late 2015, offering to sell power at Rs4.63 per unit to win NTPC Ltds contract for a 500MW solar park in Andhra Pradesh. Months later, in January, Finnish company Fortum FinnSurya Energy Pvt. Ltd went a step ahead and quoted Rs4.34 per unit to secure the contract for 70MW solar plant at NTPCs Bhadla Solar Park in Rajasthan.What these low rates now mean for consumers is that solar energy, which until recently was too expensive for large-scale use in a developing country, is now on track to compete with cheap fossil fuels. Today, Indias cheapest electricity tariff is at around Rs1-2 per unit. This rate is for the farm sector which is followed by the residential sector and then the commercial sector. But while these are of course promising figures, there is still a long way to go.  The low tariffs, for example, are a double-edged sword. Driven by aggressive bids from firms desperate for a toe-hold in this sunrise sector,  they have fuelled concerns about viability and project financing, especially for those below the Rs5 per unit threshold. SunEdison, in fact, has put its India assets on the block (some of which were incidentally picked up by Amplus).  Moreover, India still has to make available the necessary capital for developing renewable energy infrastructurethe former Planning Commission had estimated under the 12th Five Year Plan that more than a trillion dollars will be requiredand it will have to work every option on the table (from domestic industry to international donors) to fund this turnaround. Similarly, several structural issues in the distribution of power need to be addressed. Indias installed capacity of 275GW is already in excess of its demand of 140GW. Yet, there are still parts of the country where there is no electricity while in many others, power cuts are the norm. This is due to a variety of factors such as coal supply shortage, transmission losses and the poor health of power utilities.As renewables enter this mix, they will have to be integrated into the existing system and structure. As a NITI Aayog expert group report notes, A probable re-engineering of institutions, the redefinition of policies, the re-tuning of power systems, and the replacement of old habits with new ones will be required. This fundamental re-structuring of the countrys power and energy infrastructure will be its biggest challenge. Can India achieve its solar power targets?

-0.46,"Shares of sugar mills are reaching new highs every other day. Last Friday, these shares rose between 7% and 15%, with no specific news supporting the gains. Investors gains have been enormous in the past six months. Shares of Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd, for instance, have doubled in this period.
				   
				The moot question is if investors are riding their luck too far. The assumption behind the rally is that production will fall this year, and support the rally in sugar prices. Data on production, however, thus far does not show a decline. The Indian Sugar Mills Association (Isma) said last week that sugar production thus far in the current season (that is, from 1 October till 29 February) was at about 20 million tonnes (mt), compared with 19.6 mt for the same period a year ago.It added, however, that a fifth of the total sugar mills had ceased crushing sugar cane as of 29 February, compared with only 13 that had shut last year. This year, sugar crushing began earlier compared with last year, when it was delayed. The expectation in the markets is that more mills will shut operations earlier, and production will taper. If so, sugar output could still come in at the projected level of 26 mt in the current season, down from last years level of about 28 mt. Output estimates may still be met if sugar output declines as expected. If not, then there is an upside risk to output which could pose a downside risk to sugar prices. Investors in sugar mills shares need to watch this closely.Of course, this is not to say that the rally is entirely unjustified. Domestic wholesale sugar prices are up by 6.6% since January and up by nearly a fifth over a year ago. A similar trend is reflected in international prices too.Globally, major sugar growing regions are seeing weatherthe El Niño effectaffecting crop output. Crop estimates are being revised downwards. Bloomberg reported on 23 February that the International Sugar Organization, a global industry association, has said the supply deficit in 2015-16 will be 5.02 mt compared with its November estimate of 3.5 mt. Brazils output has been revised down further due to more heavy rains, adding to lower production in countries such as India and Thailand.On the export front, Isma said that 1.25 mt of sugar has been contracted for exports. That will partially fulfil the industrys commitment made to the government to export 4 mt of sugar by September. Exporting sugar in an environment of rising prices is a good thing for sugar mills.The March quarter should see the full benefit of sugar output and higher prices reflect in their performance. That should also give investors a better picture. Right now, while cane procurement prices are still high, mills are hoping to make money from higher realizations and a patchwork of government incentives for both domestic sales and exports. The increase in valuations suggests investors are already confident of a sharp recovery in earnings. Any upset on that front will reverse those gains.Apart from higher-than-anticipated domestic output in the current season, another risk to watch for is if weather conditions improve in the next season. That may see sugar output rising both in India and in global markets and put pressure on prices. Another risk, at least as far as the domestic markets are concerned, is that if sugar prices keep increasing, there could be a public outcry which may lead to a government clampdown. If food inflation picks up from its current low levels, this risk increases. For the moment though, sugar shares are basking in the warmth of investor attention.",2016-03-08,Y69uFBnOO9vWwyoHJfFQtI,"Shares of sugar mills are reaching new highs every other day with no specific news supporting the gains.

Non-interest income, which includes fees and commissions, rose 36.5% to Rs1,561.43 crore year-on-year.The lenders total expenditure fell 6% from a year earlier to Rs9,356.40 crore. Total advances fell to Rs3.54 trillion as of 30 September, from Rs4.14 trillion a year ago. The fall in advances crimped interest income, but a decline in high-cost deposits and a falling interest rate regime balanced it out.Total deposits at the end of the second quarter amounted to Rs5.67 trillion, lower than the Rs6.1 trillion a year ago. The net interest margin (NIM) for domestic operations improved to 2.85% from 2.80%, while global margins improved to 2.29% from 2.23%, the bank said.Bank of Baroda set aside Rs1,630.45 crore to cover the risk of default on bad loans, down 11.6% year-on-year and a fall of 18% on a quarter-on-quarter basis.

Just as the flow of bad news on the compliance front was ebbing, with some affected companies even getting a green signal from the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), comes news of likely action by the Department of Justice (DoJ).
				   
				The DoJ probe on suspected price collusion was already known, as firms had reported being asked to submit documents. That the probe is proceeding and the first set of charges is expected to be filed by the year-end has investors worried.On Friday, the BSE Healthcare Index fell 4.2% and closed with an 8% loss over the previous week. On Monday, things looked calmer. Lupin Ltds announcement that it has got clearance for its Goa plant from USFDA lifted its share price by 6.9%.This clears one major hurdle in its path. The news perked up sentiment for its peers, too, and the sector index closed with a gain of 1.9%, although where USFDA is concerned, it is best to keep hopes in check.Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Dr Reddys Laboratories Ltd are being probed. Bloomberg reported that totally a dozen firms and about two dozen drugs are under investigation. The potential filing of a first set of charges indicates the probe has found some actionable evidence. Thats the first worry. Also, this list can expand if the probe unearths more names. The probe comes in the backdrop of the uproar over rising medicine prices (even if only a dozen drugs figure here) among the US public.The financial hit is one thing. But one also has to contend with the embarrassment of being labelled a company that colluded to fix drug prices.

But they are right to show concern.Apart from the fallout of this investigation, a bigger one, says Kotak Securities in a research note, is the rhetoric in the presidential campaign on drug pricing.

-0.28,"The economic reform process which began dramatically over a few days at the end of July 1991 was a massive collective achievement in a country where any change for the better is stymied by the enemy within. And the plethora of books marking 25 years of that start has been enormously educative in taking us through the internal parlays, and in a few cases subterfuge, which together made it all happen. 
				   
				It is a well-worn cliché to say that the 1991 package was incomplete, and intellectually flawed (which it was), but what we now need is to pick up each thread of the impossible skein of controls wrapped around the Indian economy pre-reform, and see how it has fared over the years, and where it lies right now. We need to recognize that a second important reform impetus happened over 1999-2001 which sprung loose some tightly wound threads, and further straightened out those that had been unwrapped in 1991.Then there were reform initiatives which were talked about in 1991 but not actually introduced at the time. One such is the goods and services tax (GST). The tax reforms committee of 1991, chaired by Raja Chelliah, was tasked in its terms of reference only to look at taxes levied by the centre (this was part of the larger problem of neglect of state participation which characterized that first round of reforms). Even so, it said (para 9.3 of the interim report): It would be ideal if there were one comprehensive VAT (value-added tax) replacing the present system of Central excises, the State sales taxes and other indirect taxes except the State levy on alcoholic liquor... The GST was a brainchild of the fiscal reforms of 1991 although the committee didnt call it by that name.   The constitutional amendment to enable GST finally cleared the Rajya Sabha on 3 August, but the amendments to the bill to make that possible mean that it will have to pass through the Lok Sabha again. Then the GST bill to operationalize the tax will have to be passed, probably only in the next session of Parliament. The tortuous path of GST is possibly the only example of a reform initiative which has actually gained from its extended delay (with the exception of recent segments of it). It was sensible to first attempt value-added taxation separately in the indirect taxation sphere at the centre (the first tentative moves of which happened with MODVAT, or modified value-added tax in pre-reform 1986), and in the sphere of states (begun in 2005 in most states), before attempting to merge the two. Much will now depend on the GST network, a special purpose vehicle appointed to smooth out glitches in the information technology channels so that taxpayers can make their GST payments through a single window. The Compensatory Afforestation Bill of 2016, finally passed in the Rajya Sabha on 28 July, a long time after its passage through the Lok Sabha, is somewhat different from GST. Here is a case which completes a reform begun even earlier in 1980, where nothing whatever has been gained from the delay. On the contrary, there has been only profoundly irreversible loss. This will be fully acknowledged even by those opposed to diversion of forested land to commercial uses such as dams, which was made legally permissible by the Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980, subject to prior approval from the Government of India, and subject to payment of a prescribed sum for compensatory afforestation. Given that enactment, and given that land has already been diverted under its provisions, and compensation paid, even those opposed to forest land diversion will surely agree that such compensation should be actually used for afforestation instead of being locked up as unutilized funds. Which, believe it or not, was the situation until the recently moved bill. If those funds had been ploughed in at the time they were collected, we would actually have fully grown forests in place. What we can hope for at best now, after the bill is passed, is maybe saplings in a years time. Time lost. Environment disprotected. Irretrievable loss.A Supreme Court order dated 30 October 2002, in its judgement on a writ petition, mandated that the amounts payable under the 1980 Act should be deposited in a Compensatory Afforestation Fund. A further Supreme Court direction, dated 5 May 2006, required that in the absence of a formally legislated Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) of the kind that will now come into being with the passage of the 2016 bill, an ad hoc CAMPA be created at the Centre to centrally pool the money recovered on behalf of the said Authority lying in the States and Union territories. This suggests that between 2002 and 2006 the sequestered funding lay where it was collected, at state-level, and that between 1980 and 2002 the unsequestered funds were merged with the general budget under the general head of non-tax receipts, and dealt with, productively or otherwise, by states. Subsequent to the 2006 Supreme Court direction, the money was pooled in an ad hoc CAMPA fund at the centre. Not all was hoardedsome was indeed distributed to states, in proportion to jurisdictional collections. A report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG Report No. 21 of 2013), reports that the annual amount released from the central ad hoc CAMPA to states over the three years 2009-12 amounted to nearly Rs.3,000 crore in aggregate. Even so, the amount remaining at the centre for distribution between states, as mentioned in the preamble to the 2016 bill, is Rs.38,000 crore. This is presumably the collection since 2002, since before that nothing was being accumulated. The sum represents the total collected under several heads covering compensatory afforestation and penalties levied on those who did not take prior approval, added to the net present value of the diverted forest land or cultivated catchment area. Thus the loss in not having used this fund towards afforestation earlier is truly enormous. All that can be hoped for now, going forward, is that the monitoring mechanism proposed in the bill will ensure productive use at ground level of the accumulated funds. As for funds payable on further diversion of forest land, the 2016 bill will hand over 90% of compensatory funds received directly to states. However, the CAG report referred to above presents a very discouraging picture of state capacity to use afforestation funds effectively. The overall utilization by states of funds released over 2009-12 was as low as 61%. Even more worryingly, the utilization rates were lowest in states with high forest cover such as Arunachal Pradesh (9%), Chhattisgarh (33%), Himachal Pradesh (59%) and Meghalaya (0%).What reform has failed to do in every sphere is to improve government capacity for expenditure. Monitoring mechanisms to prevent misdirection of government expenditure merely result in obstructing expenditure altogether. Even in the 2016 bill, the steering committee mandated at state level is chaired by the chief secretary. The time and attention of the senior-most civil servant in the state, thought necessary to secure every process from corruption, becomes so thinly stretched as a result that procedural delays become the norm rather than the exception. Government processes remain substantially unreformed. The accumulation of unspent funds for afforestation, and the low level of utilization of even such funds as were disbursed to states for the purpose, is only a small part of the larger problem of unspent funds (float) lying with governments in all departments. A. Santhosh Mathew, a government officer belonging to the Indian Administrative Service, has written widely to demonstrate how this results from the antiquated system of layered file-based certification of fund utilization. He estimates that a third of reported government expenditure lies parked, unused. A workflow based IT platform for each expenditure programme, such that funds can be transferred in real time from the funding source directly to the point of expenditure, can get rid of this problem of unspent funds. To quote him: a synchronized effort to adopt IT systems across government simply means a dramatic reduction in fiscal deficit, more money for lending to the private sector, a more efficient public financial management system, and a more reliable government to conduct business with.The only reservation I have is that where government systems have been shifted onto automated platforms, automation is typically done through a tender process that selects private players working on wafer-thin margins, who run their systems with poorly paid operators, and face high employee turnover. Add to that problems with electricity, and you have systems that have users tearing their hair in frustration. Very often automated systems ask that users use the manual channel in addition, which then renders redundant the very purpose of automation. But automation with a provision for continued correction through interface with users is clearly the direction in which to move. That alone, however, will not get compensatory afforestation moving on the ground.Indira Rajaraman is an economist.",2016-08-05,YLqbMiTRGk2RemWsBYzQMN,"The tortuous path of GST is possibly the only example of a reform initiative which has actually gained from its extended delay (with the exception of recent segments of it)

0.08,"San Francisco: America just endured its first presidential election in which the majority of the electorate got its news from social media. And the outcome is already prompting soul searching by the companies that shaped it.
				   
				Facebook Inc. will have to contend with mounting dissatisfaction over its role as the most widely used news filter in history. Forty-four percent of American adults get their media through the site, many consuming news from partisan sources with which they agree. The proliferation of fake news on Facebook has also been a problem: false stories about the Clinton family committing murder and Huma Abedin being a terrorist flew fast and furious despite refutations from responsible news organizations. Those stories shaped public opinion, said Ed Wasserman, the dean of the University of California, Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism.This is a landmark, he said. Trump was able to get his message out in a way that was vastly influential without undergoing the usual kinds of quality checks that we associate with reaching mass public. You had a whole set of media having influence without really having authority. And the media that spoke with authority, the authority that comes after careful fact checking, didnt really have the influence.In a statement, a Facebook spokeswoman said: While Facebook played a part in this election, it was just one of many ways people received their information  and was one of the many ways people connected with their leaders, engaged in the political process and shared their views.Online (on Facebook, of course), current and former employees debated the companys role as an influencer. Bobby Goodlatte, a Facebook product designer from 2008 to 2012, according to his LinkedIn, today said the companys news feed was responsible for fueling highly partisan, fact-light media outlets that propelled Donald Trumps ascension to the presidency. News feed optimizes for engagement, Goodlatte wrote. As weve learned in this election, bullshit is highly engaging. In the past, Facebook has pushed back publicly against these concerns with a simple premise: News feed is just an amplification of what people would experience in a world without it. In response to Goodlatte, Andrew Bosworth, a veteran Facebook executive who helped create news feed, defended the company: News feed isnt perfect but it is at least or more diverse than the alternatives which dominated consumption in the late nineties.Behind the scenes, Facebook has been studying and analyzing its effect on news consumption. The issue was tackled at high-level meetings this summer, leading to a revision of priorities for news feed to de-emphasize media posts, in favour of posts from friends and family. The companys public relations department has worked to frame Facebook as a technology company rather than a media company, celebrating the invention of news feed on its 10-year anniversary, for example. Meanwhile, Facebook intensified its analysis of its role in creating an echo chamber and spreading fake news.We cant read everything and check everything, Adam Mosseri, the head of news feed, said in an August interview. So what weve done is weve allowed people to mark things as false. We rely heavily on the community to report content.Of course, if false news is spreading in communities that want to believe it, few will mark it as false.Echo chambers on Facebook may have helped Trump win, but Twitter Inc. gave him a way to reach American voters constantly and without an editor. Clinton also had her own Facebook and Twitter accounts, but Trump, with almost 14 million followers on the site, would often start his own news cycles with deeply opinionated and often incendiary posts. I cant think of another instance, in commercial or political communication, where Twitter was used as effectively, Wasserman said.Twitters shares rose 4.1% on Wednesday, boosted by investor recognition of its role in the election outcome. But it hasnt all been good for the company. As Trump rose on the platform, so did a set of racist, misogynist harassers supporting him, and that caused a major headache for the company. These trolls, not officially endorsed by the campaign, would regularly attack Trumps critics, in many cases causing Twitter users to feel unsafe. The clashes highlighted Twitters inability to effectively address abuse on its platform  a problem that was one reason The Walt Disney Company walked away from a potential bid for the social media site.Twitters executives, when asked about these issues during the election, said that the site is a place for all ideas. If false information or hateful rhetoric surfaces, others on the site will tweet in response.We have the world talking on this thing about the world, chief executive officer Jack Dorsey said in an interview earlier this year. So we see every spectrum of idea and conversation.Twitter didnt respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.

The company blamed the shortfall on the decision to all but exit the phone hardware business, and insisted this year would be a good one for corporate adoption of the system.Second-quarter sales in the companys More Personal Computing business, including Windows and Xbox, fell 5% to $11.8 billion. That compares with the $11.44 billion average estimate of five analysts polled by Bloomberg.

				Growth in data revenue fell to 27% on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, from 34% in the March quarter and 45% in the December 2015 quarter. In the mainstay voice business, average realization per minute improved for the second consecutive quarter, due to a reduction in promotional offers. But this strategy backfired as far as volume growth was concernedvoice volumes fell by 1% sequentially. On a y-o-y basis, voice volumes grew by just 1.8%. We have found Ideas dynamic management of the price-volume equation in the voice business impressive in the past; however, we do believe the company has not managed to strike the right balance of late, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients. In all, revenue grew by 8% y-o-y. At the same time, thanks to a vigorous expansion in its data network coverage, network operating costs rose by 16% y-o-y. Profit margins naturally fell. Adjusted for one-offs, Kotaks analysts estimate Ebitda margins fell 90 basis points y-o-y. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. A basis point is 0.01%.Profit after tax slumped 65%, which was more or less on expected lines, as interest costs almost tripled on network expansion, spectrum renewal and acquisition costs. Tracking the rise in capital expenditure and finance costs, analysts were forecasting a fall in profit. Still, the results have disappointed. While slow revenue growth and a sharp rise in costs weighed on the June quarter performance, the pressure on Idea Cellulars earnings may continue to keep investors on the edge.Hopefully, the company will change tracks with its pricing strategy and voice volume growth may come back on track.

Besides OVLs 26%, a consortium of comprising Oil India (OIL), Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Bharat PetroResources (BPRL) has acquired 23.9% stake in the field at a cost of $2.02 billion, giving them 6.56 million tons of oil.Also Read: Cabinet allows ONGC Videsh to buy 11% stake in Russias JSC Vankorneft After the stake sales, Rosneft holds 50.1%  stake in JSC Vankorneft, the company that operates the Vankor oilfield.

That agreement was subject to certain conditions including approvals from the Indian and Russian governments. All approvals are in place, leading to closure of the deal, he said. The completion within very short period of the binding agreement reflects the speed and cooperation with which both OVL and Rosneft have moved and the support that the investments by Indian companies in Russian oil sector enjoy with the Russian and Indian governments. Vankor is Rosnefts (and Russias) second largest field by production and accounts for 4% of the countrys production.Also Read: OVL, Rosneft sign pact for 11% stake in Vankorneft The daily production from the field is around 410,000 barrels per day of crude oil and 26% stake would give OVL about 107,000 bpd. The acquisition of additional 11% would add about 30% to the existing OVLs production at the current rate and approximately 2.2 million tons of oil and 1.0 billion cubic meters of gas annually, he said.

-0.9,"Tokyo: Japans Sony Corp. on Tuesday reported a 48% drop in operating profit for the July-September quarter as earthquake damage continued to affect its cash-cow imaging sensor business.
				   
				Second-quarter profit fell to 45.7 billion yen from 88 billion yen a year earlier. That compared with a Thomson Reuters Starmine SmartEstimate of 46.27 billion yen drawn from 10 analyst estimates.The result came a day after Sony lowered its full-year profit forecast by 10% to 270 billion yen due mainly to an impairment charge of 33 billion yen brought about by the sale of its battery business.Investors were unfazed by the downward revision as Sony maintained its sales outlook of 7.4 trillion yen, and losses related to the battery business sale had been flagged earlier.Its shares closed down 0.75 ahead of the earnings release, compared with a flat finish in the benchmark Nikkei stock price index.Emerging from years of restructuring, the consumer electronics manufacturer is refocusing its business to concentrate on video games, entertainment and imaging sensors, and the sale of its battery business was part of that effort.Its sensors business continued to struggle in the second quarter as a key factory damaged by a series of earthquakes in April took almost half a year to recover to pre-disaster levels.The business is part of Sonys semiconductor division, which swung to an operating loss of 4.2 billion yen from a year-before profit of 34.1 billion yen.The company nevertheless trimmed its estimated quake impact on full-year earnings to 53.5 billion yen from 80 billion yen.In gaming, operating profit fell to 19.0 billion yen from 23.9 billion yen as income earned abroad was dulled by a strong domestic currency.Investors are betting on momentum in the gaming business to pick up toward the year-end holiday shopping season with the launch later this month of the PlayStation 4 Pro, an upgrade capable of rendering high-definition graphics.Sony is also widely expected to build an early lead in the fledgling virtual-reality (VR) market, with a headset priced more modestly than those of rivals and available to its 40 million existing users of its flagship consoles.Analysts said VR could help Sony attract non-core gamers to its PlayStation platform as the firm looks to extend content for the headset into non-gaming areas such as music, TV and film.

-0.56,"When I first met Suketu Talekar in Pune, back in 2009, Brewcrafts Microbrewing Pvt. Ltd, which produces Doolally craft beers, was still making test batches of ales and ciders. As I watched Talekar, then 32, and German head brewer and co-founder Oliver Schauf, whom he met online when he was looking for a partner, haul sacks of malt and hops from the storage room to the brewery, they had to explain to me the basics of how a beer is made. 
				   
				Beer is, essentially, the shit and piss of yeast, Talekar, Doolallys co-founder, had said, guffawing. They had to carefully list the differences between an industrial beer and a craft one, and why the latter was more desirable. As Indias first microbrewery, Doolallys principal challenge then was simply letting consumers know there was more to beer than Kingfisher and Fosters. Just seven years later, India has more than 30 microbreweries. If youre anywhere in Bengaluru, Pune, Gurgaon or Mumbai, youre not far from a pub that will serve you a craft beer on tap. Even your local wine shop may have bottles of craft beer made by an Indian company. Talekar, who is in charge of Doolallys marketing and salesSchauf handles the making of the beeris neither surprised, nor overly excited, about the rapid growth of a market he helped open up. If you make a good beer, consumers will love it. That was always a no-brainer for me, he says.We are sitting at the Doolally Taproom in Bandra, Mumbai, one of three such outlets in the city. The company, which began selling its beers at The Corinthians Resort & Club in Pune in 2009, brought its brews to Mumbai in 2015. The Bandra Taproom, wholly owned and run by Doolally, was their first outlet, and since then, two more have opened, one in Andheri and another at Kemps Corner. These restaurants are perpetually filled with increasingly knowledgeable beer drinkers who dont even need the menu, let alone an explanation of what craft beer is, to place their order. But the education process has not been completed, says Talekar. We have moved a long way from walking into a bar and asking just for a beer. Now, we walk into a bar and ask for a brand and a stylea Gateway Doppelganger or an Independence IPA (India Pale Ale), he says. Customers know there are possibilities of beer beyond Kingfisher and Fosters. But really understanding what those possibilities are, that is an ongoing process.As that process continues, Talekar expects the industry to grow to a size that will dwarf what is now being heralded as a craft-beer boom. The US has seen the number of microbreweries reach nearly 5,000, even though the first one opened only in the late 1970s, he says. At this early stage in India, he sees other microbreweries more as allies than as competitors. More players means more perspective on the product. It means more experimentation. It means consumers holding brewers to a higher standard, which means improvement on the product.And he is impressed with the quality of entrepreneurs entering the craft beer industry, something he thinks will be critical to the pace it grows at. People are making conservative estimates about the market for craft beer because they are underestimating the quality of the entrepreneurs entering this market. I believe there is a qualitative difference between the early bunch of winemakers and the early bunch of craft-beer makers. I will put my money behind a statement that in five years, craft beer will be 2x or 3x bigger than the wine industry. Which would mean that in 10 years, we would have done what the wine guys havent managed to do in 25 years. And thats because of the quality of the entrepreneurs.One of the stumbling blocks for the craft-beer industry has been the red tape one has to navigate to begin making craft beer and, then, package it in a way that is profitable. A number of breweries have complained that without being allowed to bottle their beers, they are left with too few revenue streams to break even. Talekar thinks the extent of these problems is overstated. Doolally has joined hands with a few other breweries to form the Maharashtra Craft Brewers Association, and they are seeking, among other things, permission from the excise department to sell beer in growlers (air-tight jugs used to store beer) at brewpubs. It will be like parcelling beer, like you parcel food at a restaurant, Talekar explains. Someday, he would also like to see Doolally beers sitting in bottles in stores. But at the moment he is not fixated on finding new ways to package and sell his beer. Rather, his days are spent managing Doolallys Taprooms and ensuring that he wins with every consumer who walks in. Doolallys Taprooms have become popular in Mumbai as places for relaxed get-togethers. They are brightly lit, unlike other pubs; the music is soft, allowing conversation; and the walls are lined with shelves full of books and board games, suggesting this is a place you will not be hurried in. Talekar understands that the context in which he sells his beer is as important as the product. We believe that people dont come here to eat and drink. They come here for something else. They come here to spend time with friends, someone they love or their colleagues. Its like an extension of their living rooms. Born in Gujarats Bhavnagar and schooled in Nashik, Talekar did a course in production engineering from the Jawaharlal Nehru College in Aurangabad. After a stint with his fathers company, which did sales and after-sales service of diesel engines, Talekar completed his masters in business administration from the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, in 2004. He then worked as an assistant brand manager with Procter & Gamble in Singapore. He had always been a beer drinker, but had never drunk truly good beer until he began frequenting a brewpub named Brewerkz there. He returned to India a year later with the idea of bringing good beer to his home country. His conservative family wasnt too happy; they didnt think decent people should be dealing in liquor.After a decade-long journey with BrewCrafts Microbrewing/Doolally, Talekar is doing things he had never imagined he would. Such as managing a pub. We only began running our first 18 months ago, and now we have three, without raising any money. What Ive learnt in this time is that there is no greater marketing tool than experiential retail. You can actually moderate how a person feels. Thats why every Apple store is worth a hundred million dollars that Microsoft spends on advertising. Doolallys beer sales have grown 400% since 2014 and their total revenue has increased by 1,000% in the same period. Theyve also added to their staff, currently at around 180, and have moved from working out of the Taprooms to an office in Santacruz. With this pace of growth, employees come to work every day knowing they are going to have to face new challenges, which is why Talekar sees his role as that of a cheerleader. I believe in letting people be. I think that if you recruit right, then your job is to create conditions that will let people succeed and give them the leeway to make decisions and mistakes too. Its natural when you are doing so many new things for morale to dip at times. My job is to get everyone excited about the big picture.",2016-11-11,YuwrGySpWqY8lwy1eIWdqN,Why the co-founder of the hugely successful Doolally craft beers thinks the Indian craft-beer industry will be twice the size of the wine industry in five years,competitor,12:51,Suketu Talekar: Master brewer

0.34,"Vodafone Group Plc has said it is considering a merger of its Indian subsidiary with Idea Cellular Ltd. If the two companies agree, they will settle for a reverse merger, obviating the need for an IPO (initial public offering) by Vodafone India Ltd.
ALSO READ | Vodafone confirms Idea merger talks, could create Indias biggest telecom firmInvestors in telecom stocks, who had turned wary after Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds relentless onslaught, lapped up the news of possible consolidation in the sector. The market capitalization of Vodafone India, Idea Cellular and Bharti Airtel Ltd cumulatively rose by $4 billion on Monday. Shares of Idea Cellular and Bharti Airtel are now 4-5% higher compared to levels before Reliance Jios launch. While its true that a merger can result in meaningful synergies, investors are perhaps being overly sanguine about the sectors prospects post-consolidation.An analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage firm points out, Competitive intensity doesnt merely depend on the number of companies fighting for share; it largely depends on the strategy of the most credible challenger in the fight for market share. In other words, Reliance Jio will still hold the key to the sectors competitive dynamics.In fact, if the Vodafone India-Idea Cellular combine materializes, it may well inspire more competitive moves by Reliance Jio. Klaus Uhlenbruck et al., researchers based in the US, say in a paper titled Rivals reactions to mergers and acquisitions: Under conditions where rivals have significant resources to respond to a competitors acquisition or when rivals consider an acquisition to be a threat to their market position, they respond with a heightened number of actions, perhaps with greater breadth and complexity. On that note, besides Reliance Jio, even Bharti Airtel has the capacity to use significant resources to respond to the new market structure. Vodafones idea for an escape route from its Indian tormentAnd they might well have an upper hand, as Vodafone India and Idea Cellular navigate the troubled waters of integrating two very large companies. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a 24 January note to clients, The focus of a merged entity could shift toward integration, thus diverting management attention from market dynamics. We believe that both Vodafone and Idea are behind Airtel and Jio in their 4G rollout strategy and any resulting material delay in rollout would lead to some market share loss in the long run. See chart for a previous M&A (merger and acquisition) involving Vodafone that faced integration issues. While Ebitda margins have improved lately, the joint venture continues to report net losses.  Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.Of course, all of this is not to say that a Vodafone India-Idea Cellular merger doesnt make sense. Reliance Jios enormous investment in the sectoraround $30 billion for an industry with revenues of $27 billionis driving down profits and cash flow of incumbents on the one hand, and forcing them to up investments on the other. As a result, for companies such as Idea Cellular, leverage will soon reach alarming proportions.A merger will result in a stronger balance sheet, and can potentially result in higher profit margins. As such, it will provide the merged company more firepower to take on Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel. Having said this, it is too much to expect it to be a panacea. Since Vodafone India and Idea Cellular are both behind the curve in terms of investments and their broadband network rollouts, they have little time to lose. The success of the merger will depend largely on the structure the new company adopts. While an organization structure that allows nimble moves is an imperative, it remains to be seen if this is possible in a company that has two large investors with equal rights.",2017-01-31,ZL7jov9xOFIyVndDXEMN7K,The likely merger of Vodafone  and Idea may well inspire more competitive moves by Reliance Jio,both,07:44,A Vodafone and Idea merger is no panacea for the telecom sector
0.07,"Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is likely to report a gain in  quarterly profit as a strong performance in its refining business may help offset weaker petrochemical margins. 
				   
				Net profit, excluding those of its units, may increase to Rs7,842 crore on a revenue of Rs65,752.6 crore for the three months ended 31 December, according to a Bloomberg survey of 11 analysts. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported a profit of Rs7,218 crore on revenue of Rs56,567 crore. RIL will announce its third-quarter earnings on Monday. At 9.15am, RIL was trading at Rs1,091.40 on BSE, up 0.11% from previous close while Indias benchmark Sensex Index rose 0.01% to 27,238.35 points.We expect this to be the eighth consecutive sequential earnings increase. Strong refining should more than offset the likely weaker pet-chem segment (weaker margins, and likely impact of demonetization), Nomura Research said in a 5 January note to clients. Analysts expect RILs gross refining margin (GRM) to be between $10.5 per barrel and $11.5 per barrel. GRM is the realization from turning every barrel of crude oil into finished products. Reliances GRM is likely to improve by a more modest $0.7 per barrel to $10.8 per barrel in third quarter due to a five-week maintenance shutdown in one of its fluid catalytic cracking units and sharper improvement in gasoline and fuel oil cracks relative to middle distillate cracks, brokerage Jefferies India said in a 4 January note. During the quarter, benchmark Singapore complex margins increased by $1.5 per barrel sequentially to $6.7 per barrel. RILs petrochemical business is estimated to report a drop in EBIT on overall weaker margins, planned shutdown and impact of demonetization. EBIT stands for earnings before interest and taxes and is an indication of a companys profitability. Petchem will be impacted by demonetization and lower spreads. Consequently, we estimate EBITDA to dip 6% quarter-on-quarter, Edelweiss Securities said in a 6 January note. During the December quarter, RIL commissioned the first phase of its paraxylene capacity. Analysts expect RILs new refining and petchem projects to add to earnings from the second half of FY18-19. On the exploration and production front, RIL is likely to report a small loss. US shale will continue to remain loss-making. Crude oil prices are higher year-on-year but domestic gas prices are lower. KG D6 production is expected to be down 24% on a YoY (year-on-year) basis. US shale is consolidated with one quarter lag, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a report dated 9 January. Analysts expect the companys telecom business to be a drag on profitability. RIL launched its telecom operations commercially on 5 September. Post its second-quarter results announcement on 20 October, RIL said the company will be investing an additional Rs1 trillion in its telecom venture.

0.44,"Dubai: Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) probably wont need to extend a deal it reached with other crude producers to cut output, given compliance with the reductions and the outlook for an increase in global demand, Saudi energy minister Khalid Al-Falih said.
				   
				The re-balancing of the oil market should take place by the end of the first half of the year, Al-Falih told reporters during an energy event in the United Arab Emirates capital of Abu Dhabi. Demand will pick up in the summer, and Opec wants to make sure markets are well-supplied, he said.We dont think its necessary, given the level of compliance we have seen and given the expectations of demand, Al-Falih said on Monday. The re-balancing which started slowly in 2016 will have its full impact by the first half. Of course, there are many variables that can come into play between now and June, and at that time we will be able to reassess.Saudi Arabia is due to meet fellow members of the Opec in May at their bi-annual meeting in Vienna to assess the market and the groups production policy. Opec states will also gather with major producers outside the group later this month in the Austrian capital to monitor their compliance with the production cuts, which aim to reduce inventories and shore up prices. Benchmark Brent crude futures were trading 10 cents lower at $55.35 a barrel in London at 1:34 pm.ALSO READ: Oil prices fall on doubts over output cutsOpecs decision on 30 November to cut output reversed a two-year policy that let members pump all they wanted to try to maximize salesa strategy that had contributed to a worldwide glut. The producer group, together with 11 other countries including Russia, is seeking to reduce supply by about 1.8 million barrels a day. The cuts took effect on 1 January and are to last through June.All players have indicated their willingness to extend, if necessary, Al-Falih said. Based on my judgement today, I think its unlikely that we will need to continue. Demand is going to pick up in the summer, and we want to make sure the markets continue to be supplied well. We dont want to create a shortage or a squeeze, so the extension will only happen if theres a need, and if theres a a need, we will do it. Two years of market chaos led to the agreement, with decreases in investment and profits underscoring the need for joint action by producers inside and outside of Opec, he said. Extra MileAl-Falih said he was confident of the deals success. Many countries are going the extra mile in making deeper production cuts than they pledged, and Opec will stop intervening in the market once global crude inventories return to their five-year average, he said.Saudi Arabia has cut production to less than 10 million barrels a day, below its targeted level, and is currently producing at a 22-month low, Al-Falih said on 12 January in Abu Dhabi. The worlds biggest oil exporter had agreed to trim output by 486,000 barrels a day to 10.058 million as part of the global accord on supply.We will strictly adhere to our commitment and be at our cap, or as is the case now, slightly below it, Al-Falih said Monday.

-0.56,"Investors in Internet start-ups and growth-stage companies have to traverse a strange universe. The closest parallel I can find is the film industry. As a producer (investor), I might have all the right ingredientsa star-studded cast, a fantastic storyline, chart-busting music scores, breathtaking sets and cinematography, and a visionary directorbut whether or not the film does well at the box office is still somewhat of a gamble. You never know whether the reagents are just right to serve up a blockbuster.Except with the Internet start-up, its even worse since there is another twistthe simple fact that there are a bunch of other start-ups with the exact same storyline! This would be akin to several independent production houses producing the same James Bond movie (since they all own the idea or franchise)at the same time and trying to bring it to the market as fast as possible. This means that there are multiple, simultaneous, identical experiments all taking place at the same time, and no one knows who will win.But wait, I hear you say; doesnt the one who is first to the market end up winning since they will have the first-mover advantage? Well, not necessarily. The me too scenario also works. And not just with the Lyfts and Olas who are replicating Uber today. History also shows us this. Yahoo was the first, true large-scale search engine. It was upended by Google, which, apart from having (at the time) a better search algorithm, also quickly added other chemical reagents to the mixfree email, Web hosting, smartphone software, smart glasses and so on. The result? Googles market capitalization, as I write this, is almost 14 times that of Yahoo$517 billion compared to Yahoos $35 billion. I remember burning my fingers by investing in Yahoo prior to the dot-com burst of 2001. The stock first fell like a stoneand then remained at the bottom of the pond for years thereafter, before staging a weak comeback afterwards. Its still around, and is still a great company, but a Google it is not. And as a footnotewhile Yahoo went public in 1996, Google didnt go public until almost eight-and-a-half years later in 2004which in Internet terms is like a day and night of Brahma8.64 billion solar years, to be precise.In the interim, Yahoo, the firm, has had several chief executivesBartz, Morse, Thompson, Levinsohn and Mayer. (That string sounds almost like the name of a white-shoe law firm.) Not so Google, where, though Indias own Sundar Pichai is now CEO, the founding team of Larry Page, Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt agreed to work together for 20 years after the IPO (until 2024). Page handed the reins over to Pichai only last year, but still remains very involved.The same analogy can be drawn with our own earlier generation of labour arbitrage-based start-ups: the technology services firms. Firms like Infosys, Cognizant and Mindtree, while sometimes criticized for the collegiality of their founding teams, have ended up having had the last laugh despite having had to weather financial crises before. All said and done, Infosyslike Cognizant, Tata Consultancy Services and some other large Indian services companies with stable management teamsis now a global champion, and Mindtree is a strong contender in the next rung.Maybe there are lessons to be learnt from this for Indias array of current start-ups, which saw a market arbitrage opportunity to enter the Internet retail space before their larger global counterparts could enter the market, essentially creating the equivalent of Jack Mas Chinese Alibaba. Flipkart and Snapdeals valuations seem to have hit a wall. Much of the publicity associated with this has been focused on the fact that foreign investors, afraid of a global slowdown and unproven business models, have written down their existing investments in the sector and are unwilling to pony up more cash. And the global market leader, Amazon, has entered the Indian market in a big way.The current bearish scenario in international markets will surely change, just as it did post-2001 and then again post-2008, so the trick is just to hold on and fend off Amazons advance until the financial tide turns. Despite recent changes in the law, Amazon is after all not an Indian firm and will face more hurdles than the home-grown rivals. But, meanwhile, instead of signing long-term agreements to work together and weather what is just a simple financial stormso that they can later go public and monetize their holdingsmany senior executives at these firms seem to be using the revolving door.Just like in the movies, you can only have one or two heroes/heroines in the cast. And the same is true of the villains. Similarly each start-up can only have one or two sultans or sultanas, but constancy in the top teams is vital. Google has its Page, Facebook its Zuckerberg, Alibaba its Ma, and Snapdeal and Flipkart have their Bahl and Bansals. But the sultans need to think of Henry Fords maxim when it comes to business: Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success. A series of cameo appearances does not a blockbuster make.Siddharth Pai is a world-renowned technology consultant who has personally led over $20 billion in complex, first-of-a-kind outsourcing transactions.",2016-04-20,ZQFsl3WTYrbJ5oGFrfBQFM,"Each start-up can only have one or two sultans or sultanas, but constancy in the top teams is vital

-0.27,"San Francisco: Apple Inc. reported quarterly revenue that topped analyst projections, fueled by demand for the companys latest and priciest iPhones.
				   
				Apple said sales rose 3.3% to $78.4 billion, with earnings of $3.36 a share in the three months through 31 December. Analysts forecast profit of $3.22 a share on revenue of $77.3 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shares gained as much as 3.5% in extended trading, after the results.We were surprised by the strength of iPhone 7 Plus where we were actually short of supply throughout the quarter. Weve been able to come into supply-demand balance in January, chief financial officer Luca Maestri said Tuesday in a telephone interview.Introduced in September, the iPhone 7 represented a modest update to its predecessor, the 6S, adding water resistance, an improved camera, battery life and processor while retaining similar styling. Expectations are mounting for a more significant upgrade to Apples flagship product later this year, which is the 10th anniversary of the iPhones launch.Apple said it sold 78.3 million iPhones in the final quarter of 2016, generating $54.4 billion in revenue in the period. The average sales price for each iPhone was $695, compared with $691 a year earlier. Analysts had forecast iPhone unit sales of 76.3 million and an average selling price of $688, according to a Bloomberg News survey. That suggested consumers are still eager to snap up Apples latest models, which bodes well for future product launches.The iPhone 7 is our most popular model, chief executive officer Tim Cook said in a conference call with analysts. We saw especially strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which was a higher portion of the new product mix than weve ever seen with Plus models in the past.Since the iPhone 7 Plus base price is $20 more than its predecessor, that boosted the average selling price and offset the impact of some people still buying the older 6S Plus and the cheaper iPhone SE.Sales in the three months through March will be $51.5 billion to $53.5 billion, the Cupertino, California-based company said in a statement. The average estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey was $53.8 billion. Apple expects a gross profit margin of 38% to 39% in the period, while analysts forecast 38.7%.The takeaway is that the top end of their guidance is close to where the street is at, said Gene Munster, a longtime Apple analyst and head of VC firm Loup Partners. The demand for the 7 Plus was strong when they reported the September quarter and that strength carried on into December.Global smartphone sales were largely unchanged in 2016, after years of growth, according to researcher IDC. That puts pressure on Apple because the iPhone generates almost two-thirds of Apples revenue. In addition to churning out new handsets, Cooks response has been to drive adoption of services such as Apple Music, iCloud and the App Store. Services revenue again represented the fastest growing segment, with sales jumping 18% to $7.2 billion in the holiday quarter.Sales in China fell 12% to $16.2 billion, the only region to see a decline. Apple said it generated 64% of its revenue overseas in the holiday quarter.IPad sales continued their slide, declining 22% from a year earlier to $5.5 billion. Mac revenue increased 7% to $7.2 billion.Cook has also discussed the potential of augmented reality and the possibility of major acquisitions to expand.

-0.5,"Mumbai/Tokyo/Chicago: The emergence of Shahid Khan, the NFL team owner who made his fortune selling car bumpers, in the race to rescue embattled Japanese airbag manufacturer Takata Corp. pits the billionaire against more established parts suppliers and some of the worlds biggest buyout firms.
				   
				Pakistan-born Khan, 66, migrated as a teenager to the US, where he started washing dishes for $1.20 an hour. He later built Urbana, Illinois-based Flex-N-Gate Corp. into an auto-parts supplier that ranks him among the richest Americans, with an estimated net worth of about $5 billion. Along the way, he bought the Jacksonville Jaguars in Florida and the London-based Fulham Football Club, and landed on a cover of Forbes magazine in 2012 as the Face of the American Dream.Now, Khans bumper-and-headlight maker is one of five suitors for Tokyo-based Takata, which is looking for a buyer after some of its devices ruptured and killed at least 16 people, prompting repairs that could exceed 100 million devices worldwide, according to a person familiar with the matter.Flex-N-Gate, which doesnt make airbags, will go up against established suppliers such as Stockholm-based Autoliv Inc., Chinese-owned Key Safety Systems Inc. and Japans Daicel Corp. Private equity firms KKR & Co. and Bain Capital, partnering with Daicel, are also said to have submitted bids.Automakers may prefer an established company as a buyer compared with Flex-N-Gate, said Kavan Mukhtyar, a management consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Mumbai who has advised on strategy and operations in the automotive industry. But considering its global aspirations, Flex-N-Gate can offer better valuations. And in a deal, valuation plays a critical role.Proposals from Takata buyers are being discussed at meetings scheduled in Japan this week between the supplier and automakers including Honda Motor Co. The central issue for the airbag makers customers is how those takeover bids divide up the responsibility for billions of dollars in recall costs and liabilities.Representatives for Flex-N-Gate and Takata declined to comment on the bids. Flex-N-Gate declined to make Khan available for an interview.Track record
A lack of a track record in making airbags may count against Flex-N-Gate in its bid for Takata, said Koji Endo, an analyst with SBI Securities Co. in Tokyo. Airbags are an area where the margins are relatively high and the hurdles for new entrants are also high, Endo said.Automakers have said ensuring a stable and reliable supply of airbags is one of their top priorities, even as they seek longer-term engineering solutions and to diversify their supplier base.Khan may be able to make up for a lack of experience in airbags with the work ethic thats propelled his career, according to Jim Womack, whos authored several books on lean manufacturing and has spoken with the billionaire about his upbringing in Pakistan.Khan recalled playing golf with his father where fairways were lined with beggars whod throw back errantly hit balls in exchange for tips. Womack said Khan left for America to escape a country where one couldnt lose.Driven guy
He can walk through a factory and have a real sense of whats going on, unlike a thousand CEOs Ive met whove never done what some of us would call real work, said Womack, the founder of and senior adviser to Lean Enterprise Institute Inc. Hes a driven guy. Not an awful guy but hes in this to win.Khan, whose father sold surveying equipment and mother was a math professor in Pakistan, began working for Flex-N-Gate while still an engineering student, according to a profile posted on the Jacksonville Jaguars website.Flex-N-Gate at the time used to make auto bumpers by welding together different pieces. Khan sought and succeeded in coming up with a seamless bumper that would be easier to manufacture, Khan said on stage in 2014 at Chicago Ideas Week.He left the company to set up Bumper Works, which designed and manufactured lightweight seamless fenders, landing General Motors as its first customer, Khan said at the Chicago forum. Two years later Khan purchased his former employer when it came up for sale and folded Bumper Works into Flex-N-Gate.Business expansion
Over the next decade, Khan led the transition of Flex-N-Gate from an after-market parts producer to an original equipment manufacturer. He expanded by acquiring businesses including mechanical assembly supplier Ventra Group Inc. in 2001, the bumper business from Meridian Automotive Systems in 2009 and a headlamps and taillights business from Ford Motor Co.The company counts major automakers including Ford, Volkswagen AG, Toyota Motor Corp. and Suzuki Motor Corp. its customers and operates 54 manufacturing facilities globally.For Khan, buying Takata will give him an estimated 22% global market share in airbags, a business that Autoliv forecasts may expand to $10.3 billion by 2018 from $9.5 billion in 2015, as emerging markets like India catch up with safety standards in developed countries.Acquiring Takata also would allow Khan to diversify Flex-N-Gates business of supplying front-end modules and plastic parts and into higher-margin segments dominated by a few suppliers.Despite its troubles, Takata has technology, long-standing relationships with clients and plays in a field with very few competitors, said Deepesh Rathore, director at Emerging Markets Automotive Advisors in London. For Flex-N-Gate, this is a good opportunity to diversify into a new component segment. Bloomberg",2016-09-29,a92kAmGXZSkm9Q7FmphFXI,"Shahid Khan, the NFL team owner who made his fortune selling car bumpers, is in the race to rescue embattled Japanese airbag manufacturer Takata

				Sales at Madura Fashion and Lifestyle, which has premium brands, fell 3% in April-June, the second consecutive quarterly drop. As the company refrained from deep discounting to protect brand value, throughput volumes fell, impacting the units operating profit.Sales at Pantaloons, which operates in the value segment, grew 31%, helping the company register a respectable revenue growth of 8%. With the division seeing good traction, analysts expect it to continue to drive growth at AB Fashion and Retail.But it will be lopsided growthnot least because Madura is more profitable than Pantaloons.A significant part of AB Fashion and Retails capital is invested in Madura (roughly half of stand-alone assets are in Madura). The division generates more than half of AB Fashions revenues and weak performance is weighing on the overall performance.The company is recalibrating the Madura business.It is reducing fixed costs, increasing the season cycles and is driving digital transformation through the omni channel programme (shoppers can check unavailable inventory at stores and order online).The measures and inventory drawdown process are estimated to take another quarter to begin showing results, which means Q2 could also be weak.Aided by the wedding and festive season, the company expects Maduras performance to recover from October or in the second half of the fiscal year. But the street is sceptical. The stock fell sharply after the Q1 results and is yet to recover.That is due to weak pricing power. Discounts have become sales drivers. Online platforms continue to offer high discounts and retail stores are being forced to follow suit. Further, with the consolidation in e-commerce firms (such as the Myntra-Jabong combination), analysts fear the market will continue to see pricing pressures.To be sure, the problem is not typical to AB Fashion.The whole apparel and retail industry is facing pressure on prices and realizations.It looks like now that it is a new normal that there will be discounting, there will be schemes and you have to live with those and then really still ensure that you can make money out of it, Shoppers Stop Ltd told analysts last month.But companies are getting around this. Branded apparel divisions of both Arvind Ltd and Raymond Ltd registered good sales growth in the June quarter. It is a different matter that these companies are yet to attain decent profitability.But AB Fashions Madura is yet to even reach this stage.

				In an interview, Davie talks about BBC Worldwides revenues, potential of the Indian market and the companys joint venture with Sony Pictures Network to launch a new infotainment channel, Sony BBC Earth.  Edited excerpts:BBC Worldwide monetizes BBC brands and programmes. How big is BBCs brands business?Critically, we are separate from the news business. We are in the content business and we work on co-producing and distributing programmes around the world. We are a profitable organization, doing just a bit more than £1 billion in revenue. In terms of cash returns, we returned over £200 million to BBC group last year.What kind of content do you focus on?We often focus on content largely originating from British creatives. In the area of factual programming, we do programmes like natural history documentaries. In entertainment, we have programmes like Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa in India; we have produced that in over 50 countries. Most of our sales are in drama and fiction, whether it is Sherlock or Doctor Who. In the UK, we are the biggest drama distributor, and outside the US, we have the biggest catalogue of television programmes.Which are your best markets? If you are in the media business, the US is the biggest market and that holds true for us as well. We have a big business with BBC America, plus we produce Dancing with the Stars for ABC Network. Outside that, we tend to work well in markets where there is a deep cordial connection or historic ties with the English language or the UK. We are into markets like Australia, Singapore and also places like India where obviously the cordial connection is so strong. We have an amazing growth area in India. India and the UK have common cultural ties that go to our programming and are not just limited to cricket.What are your expectations from India?India currently contributes under 5% to our global revenues. This is a market where we are going to see continued growth. We have three primary businesses in Indiaproduction, TV sales and digital sales, and what we are really looking forward to is launching a channel in India. It will be a joint venture with Sony Pictures Network. The channel will be called Sony BBC Earth and focus on natural history, science and adventure. It will showcase international content. We are currently waiting for government approvals.There is no doubt that the media market in India is set for continued growth. I cant give you an exact number, but the potential here is significant.Globally, what is the most striking trend in the media and entertainment industry?From a broadcasting perspective, there is huge growth in dramaglobal drama and fiction. There has been unstoppable growth in the industry of scripted dramas like Sherlock. There is an appetite for cut-through content that makes a real difference. Like Sherlockpeople are hungry for the next episode.In music, live music and music streaming is growing. This kind of content is not available on demand or on YouTube. We did a live special with Adele in London, which sold brilliantly around the world. We are seeing a more event-based programming in music.How rapidly is BBC Worldwide growing?Last year, our revenues grew at 6.7%, profit was broadly 3-4%, but we sold a part of BBC America. I cant say about the targets, but we have promised to return £1.2 billion to our shareholders in the next five years. We are looking for over 20% growth in the next five years.How big is BBCs digital division? In US, we have announced that we are going over-the-top with a BBC service that people will be able to subscribe to. Separately, in places like Singapore, we have a BBC Player where people can access certain content. So, clearly, we are not constrained or limited by a linear channel.There are a lot of opportunities for us in India as well.Where is the future of digitalin advertising or behind a paywall?It would be presumptuous at this point to say definitely that one model works and the other doesnt. It depends on the content. I will say, in our experience in the digital market, it certainly seems that subscription services are for long-form programming. It has its attraction to the consumers.But that doesnt mean we have a hardened policy in this area.

However, we will now do whatever is required to deal with this situation, the group holding company said in a statement.It added that Tata Sons had expected Mistry to resign as chairman of the group operating companies once he was ousted as chairman of the holding company and his refusal demonstrates his absolute disregard of longstanding Tata traditions, values and ethos.This is the first time since removing Mistry on 24 October that Tata Sons has elaborated on the ostensible reasons for his ouster. Since then, the independent directors of Indian Hotels Co. Ltd (IHCL) and Tata Chemicals Ltd have backed Mistry.Pointing to the first instance, the Tata note said this reveal the true colours of Mr. Mistry and his ulterior objective. It accused him of trying to gain control of IHCL by ensuring he would be the only Tata Sons representative on its board over the years. The statement said this seems to have been Mistrys strategy, planned and executed over the past four years.A person close to Mistry refuted charges of an ulterior motive of taking control of companies. He said giving the example of Indian Hotels only because independent directors, one of whom is also a director of Tata Trust, demonstrated true independence, is not in keeping with Tata governance standards, the person said.A look at the board composition of the top six listed Tata group firms where Mistry is chairman shows at least half the board was appointed before 2012, when he took charge. The Tata statement, which runs into nine pages, also cited falling dividend income and increasing impairment provisions, ballooning debt and low return on investments as reasons for removing him as chairman of the $103 billion group.Tata Sons also alleged that under Mistry, the edifice of the group founded in 1868 had been consciously dismantled, resulting in operating companies drifting away from the promoter company and their shareholders.With the exception of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), dividends received from all 40 other firms (many non-dividend paying) in its portfolio have continuously declined from Rs1,000 crore in 2012-13 to Rs780 crore in 2015-16 but the latter figure includes additional interim dividend of Rs100 crores which would have been normally received in 2016-17 (due to budgetary changes), the statement said. It added that in the past four years, the groups debt had increased by Rs69,877 crore to over Rs2.25 trillion.Despite huge investments by firms, the returns are not visible in increased profits, though, in all fairness, some major growth projects like the new steel plant at Kalinganagar will show results only in coming years, the statement said.The person close to Mistry said the Tata Sons statement had selective data, unsubstantiated claims and half truths, without a word of explanation as to why it became necessary to remove him summarily, violating natural justice and without explanation.This person pointed to the high operating profit margin of 14% for Tata Steel Europe in 2014 and the narrowing losses in the Mundra power project (admittedly because of lower coal prices) as examples of improvement under Mistry. This was the largest turnaround in Indian corporate history involving multiple companies and is still a work in progress, said this person.Proxy advisory firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS) said the Tata statement is inconsistent.You cant blame him (Mistry) for non-performance of one company and not give any credit for the good show of the other, said Amit Tandon, IiAS founder and managing director. Mistrys aide cited earlier said the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of Tata Sons lauded his performance on 28 June and its report was adopted by the entire board. Tata Sons is yet to state what necessitated the replacement of Mr. Mistry on October 24 without any notice or an opportunity to defend himself, this person said. Tandon said the Tata Sons statement would have been far more effective and taken a lot more seriously had it come on the day Mistry was removed. Its a bit late in the day.",2016-11-10,aP0lU51O5emJzfxr63fgEL,This is the first time since removing Cyrus Mistry on 24 October that Tata Sons has elaborated on the ostensible reasons for his ouster ,company,14:13,"Tata Sons escalates war with Cyrus Mistry, says trust betrayed"

				Utility vehicle (UV) sales, within the auto segment, are growing at a robust pace. The demand for farm equipment is expected to get better soon on the back of a normal monsoon. Its Korean unit, too, is clocking reasonable sales numbers.The March quarter has reignited hope for the M&M stock. A host of new launches in the passenger vehicle segment made up for lost market share, at least partly, in the UV segment. Note that the company faced bad times in this segment for about eight quarters, with UV sales plummeting as increasing diesel prices and higher duties turned away customers.Add to this, M&M was caught on the back foot as foreign automobile firms flooded the markets with compact UVs, a segment that M&M did not brace itself for.Further, farm equipment sales that have languished, thanks to weak demand after deficit rains for two consecutive years, are inching up.During the March quarter, the companys sales were 15% more than a year ago in the auto segment and 13% in the farm equipment business. Pent up demand with better prospects for farming should rev up tractor sales, in the coming months.A higher farm share in M&Ms product mix will boost the companys operating margin.That said, the downside risk to profit margins comes from rising raw material costs and marketing expenses to combat competition.Besides, M&Ms initiative to have petrol variants for its vehicles will take time to establish in the market.Its portfolio is predominantly diesel-driven, which itself is a threat to sales growth, given the ban on large diesel passenger vehicles in some states and the losing cost edge versus the petrol ones.In any case, the Street has charted out a 15-16% revenue growth for M&M, including its unit, Mahindra Vehicle Manufacturers Ltd, during FY17. This is good news as it comes after a revenue contraction in FY15 and a low single-digit growth in FY16.Meanwhile, Ssangyong Motor Corp., its South Korean subsidiary, clocked two consecutive quarters of operating profit, which is valuation accretive.All this optimism across business segments has taken the stock up by about 15% since the beginning of April.However, at the current market price of Rs.1,390, M&Ms shares are trading close to their five-year highs as the Street was quick to price in the positives in the firm.",2016-06-27,aRHI5y9K9P3aEleFzf9jRL,"In the March quarter, the companys sales were 15% more than a year ago in the auto segment and 13% in the farm equipment business

-0.41,"Microsofts move to purchase LinkedIn for $26.2 billionthe largest company-for-company acquisition in the technology industry since Hewlett Packards 2002 purchase of Compaqis bringing out the predictable talk of irrational exuberance. But if the deal does indicate a bubble, its not necessarily in tech or in stocks.
				   
				First, the combination actually makes sense on many levels. The companies both cater to older, corporate users, and have similar missions, with Microsoft seeking to enable people and businesses throughout the world to realize their full potential, and LinkedIn to connect the worlds professionals to make them more productive and successful. Putting the two together could allow for some significant cost savings: Microsoft could economize a lot simply by imposing some discipline on LinkedIns profligate use of stock-based compensation, which the social-networking company has forecast at about $580 million in 2016, on revenues of between $3.65 and $3.7 billion.Second, this isnt a typical stock-market-bubble deal. In such transactions, a company with an inflated stock price issues equity to fund the purchase of another company with an inflated stock price, often driving the prices of both companies higher on some kind of 1 + 1 = 3 logic. Microsoft, by contrast, is paying for the deal in cash. The stock market, for its part, has initially reacted pessimistically: Microsofts market valuation has fallen more than LinkedIns has risen, leaving the combined entity worth less than the individual companies were on Friday.For a better sense of where the bubble might be, consider how Microsoft is raising the cash to fund the deal. The money will come entirely from new bond issues, adding about $25 billion to a debt load that has already increased by about $15 billion over the past year:Corporate debt issuance has surged since the 2008 financial crisis for a variety of reasons, including central banks easy-money policies, low or negative interest rates in much of the developed world and foreign central banks more recent moves to purchase corporate bonds directly. In the US, corporate bonds outstanding amounted to 27% of gross domestic product as of March 2016, up from 20% at the end of 2007:To be sure, some of the debt issuance is a form of tax arbitrage: instead of incurring tax liabilities by bringing in cash from abroad to pay for stock buybacks, US tech and pharmaceutical companies are instead borrowing the money at home. That said, when a source of funding is too cheap it will be abused, and excess issuance is generally a big danger sign, whether it involves tech IPOs in the late 1990s, mortgage debt in the middle 2000s, energy debt in the early 2010s or corporate debt today.

-0.2,"New Delhi: In a setback to energy firms like ONGC and Cairn India, the government will from this fiscal levy service tax of about Rs730 crore on royalties they pay to the exchequer on oil and gas they produce.
				   
				Companies currently pay 9.09% of the price they realise on oil and gas produced from onland or onshore fields and 16.67% on the same from offshore areas. The Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC), in a recent clarification, has stated that the licence granted by the government to a company to exploit a natural resource is a taxable service and hence liable for service tax.As a rule, service tax is paid by the entity providing the service, but in certain cases it is the liability of the party that receives the service to remit the levy under a system called reverse charge. In the circular clarifying on service tax liability on use of wireless spectrum, CBEC stated that all periodic payments such as royalty on use of natural resources will attract 15% service tax.Following the clarification, the Service Tax department has sent letters to companies like Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), Cairn India Ltd and Reliance Industries seeking information on royalty payments, industry sources said.These companies had paid a total of Rs4,885 crore royalty on oil and gas produced in 2015-16. Considering change in prices and production profile, the service tax liability would come to over Rs730 crore this fiscal on top of the royalty payout. CBEC is using the logic that since service tax is leviable on wireless spectrum, which is a natural resources, the same should extend to oil and gas as well.Sources said energy explorers through their association have taken up the matte with the oil ministry saying their profitability has been severely impacted by slump in oil and gas prices to multi-year low and the additional levy would erode it further. CBEC in the circular stated that one-time payments for natural resources are exempt from service tax but not any periodic payments. Oil companies have to pay royalty on a monthly basis. Exemption from payment of service tax is applicable only to one time charge, payable in full upfront or in installments, for assignment of right to use any natural resource and not to any periodic payment required to be made such as Spectrum User Charges, license fee in respect of spectrum, or monthly payments with respect to the coal extracted from the coal mine or royalty payable on extracted coal and other natural resources, CBEC has said.

0.91,"Bengaluru: Google parent Alphabet Inc. bested analysts estimates for third-quarter profit and revenue on Thursday as the search company showed it has honed its core business for the mobile era and is closing in on the next wave of computing. 
				   
				Propelled by strong advertising on mobile devices and video site YouTube, Alphabets net income climbed 27% to $5.06 billion. Revenue jumped 20% to $22.45 billion, marking the search giants seventh straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth. The company authorized a $7 billion repurchase of its Class C stock, pleasing investors who had been craving more after a $5 billion repurchase last year. Google is competing fiercely with social network Facebook Inc. for dominance in the fast-growing mobile advertising market. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai touted the companys gains in the space, and was bullish about recent product launches such as the Google Assistant, the Google Home smart speaker and refinements to the enterprise cloud business.The products are aimed at the rise of voice search, which many analysts believe will succeed keyboards and touch screens as a primary way users interact with devices. We feel well positioned as we transition to a new era of computing, Pichai said in an conference call. This new era is one in which people will experience computing more naturally and seamlessly in the context of their lives, powered by intelligent assistants and the cloud.Shares of Alphabet, the worlds No. 2 company by market value, were up 1.6% in after-hours trading.The company posted third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $9.06, beating expectations of $8.63 a share on revenues of $22.05 billion, according to Thomson Reuters estimates.Google has been dogged by concerns about how it would nudge its vast web advertising business towards mobile, but the companys recent performance has reassured Wall Street that the transition is well underway, said analyst Colin Gillis of BGC Partners.Its showing that even though theyve hit lifetime highs, theres still room to run, he said. Advertising revenue, the companys lifeblood, rose 18.1% to $19.82 billion in the third quarter. Paid clicks, or ads for which advertisers pay only when users click on them, rose 33%, compared with a rise of 29% in the second quarter. Cost-per-click, or the average amount advertisers pay Google, fell 11% in the latest period, but investors are willing to forgive the slump for now, as it suggests strong mobile growth, said analyst Kerry Rice of Needham & Co. YouTube continued to post robust gains, Pichai said. Over the past year, Google, Facebook and Twitter Inc. have all doubled down on video, a format where advertisers are willing to pay a premium for a few seconds of users undivided attention. Advertising accounted for 89.1% of Googles total revenue in the quarter, and analysts are eager for the company to tap new sources of growth. One of the leading contenders is Googles cloud business, which drove a 38.8% rise in the companys other revenue.As we head into 2017, I expect cloud to be one of our largest areas of investment, Pichai said. A relatively late entrant to the cloud business, Google is trying to steal market share from industry leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Amazon on Thursday reported a 55% revenue increase in its cloud business.I would hesitate to say they are competing head-to-head, but they are making up for lost ground, Rice said. Alphabets Other Bets unit generated revenue of $197 million, primarily from Nest, Google Fiber and Verily units, chief financial officer Ruth Porat said during the call. Alphabet said this week it was pausing the rollout of Fiber, a high-speed internet service, in some US cities and that its leader Craig Barratt would leave. Porat played down analysts concerns of instability at Other Bets, which has suffered a wave of executive departures, including Nest founder Tony Fadell, self-driving car technology chief Chris Urmson and, most recently, Barratt.As we reach for moonshots that will have a big impact in the longer term, its inevitable that there will be course corrections along the way, and that some efforts will be more successful than others, Porat said.Other Bets, which also includes research unit X, reported an operating loss of $865 million, down from a year-ago loss of $980 million. The narrowing loss suggests Porat is instilling the financial discipline investors have long hoped to see from the company, said Gillis.Everybody loves Ruth, he said.

0.21,"Earnings of refiners for the September quarter are likely to decline compared to the June quarter. Indian refining firms had benefited from substantial inventory gains in the June quarter, but that advantage will not be available for the September quarter, as there may not be a major inventory impact considering oil prices have not moved dramatically.
				   
				Whats more, refining margins have inched up only a bit. Benchmark Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) last quarter came in at $5.1 a barrel against $5 a barrel in the June quarter. In short, even though refining margins have risen a bit, lack of substantial inventory gains will mean that reported GRMs of Indian refining firms are likely to be sequentially lower.State-run refining and marketing companiesBharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd are no exception to that trend. On an overall basis, subdued refining performance will more than offset the benefit of robust market margins (calculated diesel retail margins up 32% QoQ) and healthy marketing volumes, wrote Edelweiss Securities Ltd analysts in their September quarter preview.

Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. But investors are sitting on good gains so far this year.

Ltd wrote in a report on 10 October. The brokerage firm estimates RILs stand-alone net profit to increase by 11% year-on-year and only 4% quarter-on-quarter decline, helped by strong refinery throughput and higher petrochemical earnings. Its GRM is expected to be close to $10 a barrel compared to $11.5 a barrel in the June quarter. Updates on its expansion projects and telecom business will be crucial for the stock. The RIL stock has gone up about 8% from its recent low on 2 September following the announcement of the forthcoming commercial launch of services by its telecom unit, at its annual general meeting.Meanwhile, the story continues to be grim for oil producersOil and Natural Gas Corp.

-0.61,"With China making rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI)-based research, it is imperative that India view AI as a critical element of its national security strategy, recommends an August 2016 report titled India and the Artificial Intelligence Revolution. Authored by Shashi Shekhar Vempati of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the report advocates spurring AI-based innovation and establishing AI-ready infrastructure as prerequisites for preparing Indias jobs and skills markets for an AI-based future and securing its strategic interests. 
				   
				Here are highlights from the report:AIs potential in IndiaThanks to the increasingly digital economy, fuelled by improving education and globalization, the Indian consumer is unknowingly the countrys biggest beneficiary of recent advances in AI, notes the report. From utilizing various applications powered by AI to using a range of online services such as Amazon Marketplace and Netflix that learn from consumers online behaviour to make intelligent product and service recommendations, consumers are readily engaged with the proliferation of AI in India, whether they appreciate it or not. Policymakers, however, lag behind, not exploiting AI for national security, public services, or other priorities.Indian academics, public researchers, labs, and entrepreneurs face a different challenge than the corporations that dominate the spacethe infrastructure necessary for an AI revolution in India has been neglected by policymakers.Why China is stealing a march in AI researchWhile lack of physical infrastructure is certainly a major impediment, Indias AI development also suffers from the paucity of the necessary cultural infrastructure, which is key for recent advances from lab to marketplace in AI. Fostering a culture of innovation and a commitment to research and, most important, nurturing an ecosystem beyond the four walls of the organization are all common to Googles DeepMind, IBMs Watson, and Baidus Institute of Deep Learning, the most successful AI projects of the past half decade.While it must come as no surprise that Google, IBM, Microsoft, Facebook, and other global technology giants have invested significantly over the decades in machine intelligence, it is the story of Baidu that holds the most pertinent lessons for India.The story of AI at Baidu is the story of Andrew Ngan associate professor at Stanford University who teaches a popular course on machine learning (also available via Coursera, an online learning platform that he co-founded). Ng was hired away from the Google Brain project in 2014, following which Baidu invested heavily in physical infrastructure. Baidu is investing in deep speech for voice-based searches that leverage speech recognition. This intelligence is being built for understanding and interpreting queries in Mandarin rather than English; as such, Baidu is constructing a uniquely Chinese platform, independent of that which is used ubiquitously in the English-speaking West.This version of AI thus offers the possibility for the development of AI in India, as an example of AI technology successfully developed in and employed by a non-Western nation. Baidus investment in AI research exposes the relative backwardness of Indias technological infrastructure: China has recognized the importance of bridging the gap between the lab and the market while nurturing a research and innovation ecosystem unbounded by national borders and corporate firewalls. India, in contrast, boasts neither the material nor the cultural institutions required for such innovation.Prime Minister Narendra Modi often challenges Indian IT entrepreneurs, asking when India will give birth to the next Google or Microsoft. But until India attains the infrastructure omnipresent in the US, and increasingly existent in China, the deep-learning capabilities necessary to address the vast linguistic diversity across India using machine intelligence may prove elusive.AIs impact on Indian jobsWhile India dreams of its own manufacturing revolution through Modis Make in India programme, it is important for policymakers to closely examine how the advent of industrial robots and their impact on manufacturing transformed companies in other developing nations.Consider the case of Foxconnone of the worlds largest contract manufacturers for electronics. In 2015, Foxconn made news when its chief executive, Terry Gou, predicted that 70% of all manufacturing in Foxconns assembly lines would be automated with robots displacing humans. Some back-pedalling later, his estimate was scaled down to 30%. Foxconn is among the top owners of robotics patents filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and produces thousands of industrial robots a year that in aggregate are capable of performing more than ten types of manufacturing tasks. This is expected to have a significant impact on the workforce: as many as 60,000 workers have been displaced by robots in one Foxconn factory alone in the Kunshan region of China.China was projected to have more installed industrial robots by the end of 2016 than any other country, with more than 30 robots for every 10,000 industrial workers. If China were to increase that density, employment would be further damaged.While the dire predictions of a robot takeover of manufacturing have not come to pass, the reality of automation is that manufacturing is unlikely to create jobs at the scale that it did in the past. Quoting the US Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2013 on future employment projections, Darrell M. West of the Center for Technology Innovation at Brookings highlights how jobs will decline over the next decade in manufacturing and information technology among other sectors.Writing in Pacific Standard magazine, Frank Levy, professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, places jobs dislocation on account of AI in perspective when he dismisses the dire projections of a robot takeover. According to Levy, the greatest area of concern for policymakers ought to be the impact of AI on jobs in the middle-skill categoryassembly line workers, clerical workers, and the like. Levy also warns of significant dislocation caused by automation leading to a reduction in an individuals potential for upward mobility. He emphasizes that a good education will be critical to acquire the necessary skills and to be competitive in this evolved labour market.In their book The Second Machine Age, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee make several specific policy recommendations for coping with the job crisis likely to be spurred by AI. A key recommendation of particular importance for India, given Modis Startup India initiative, is the need to restart startups. Brynjolfsson and McAfee view creative destruction inherent within the start-up economy as the best bet for experimenting with the new jobs and industries that can thrive in an AI-driven economy. The authors provide examples of start-ups such as TaskRabbit and Airbnb that contrive previously non-existent economic opportunities for ordinary people with spare time and assets, thus creating economically productive work.Skill development for future jobsNot everyone is as sanguine as Brynjolfsson and McAfee about the coming AI revolution. The recent victory of AlphaGo (a computer program developed by Google DeepMind) over the world champion in Go has prompted fears of the threat posed by intelligent machines that are capable of superhuman tasks. The direst warning comes from noted physicist Stephen Hawking, who apocalyptically predicts the end of the human race with the development of full artificial intelligence.In the provocative book Humans Need Not Apply, Jerry Kaplan, an American computer scientist and futurist, explores this and several other questions while attempting to paint a picture of an apocalyptic future and what it might look like if and when machines take over. Specifically, Kaplan raises two issues that should be of interest to policymakers in India. The first is the education system and the second involves skills and jobs. While discussing the likely impact of AI on labour markets, Kaplan poses the radical question: Is the current system of sequential education and work outdated, and does it require an overhaul?In his book, Kaplan also proposes a so-called job mortgage as a new type of financial instrument through which employers, vocational schools and colleges would have an incentive to collaborate in a new way. In this proposed job mortgage market, Kaplan attempts to use free market mechanisms to match current skills acquisition to future job opportunities. He proposes to accomplish this by compelling employers to commit to an intent to employ an individual in the future if that person commits to acquire a specific set of skills over a certain time frame. India will have to experiment with the kind of innovative instruments that Kaplan proposes if it is to prepare itself for the challenges from a machine intelligence-driven economy in the near future.",2017-01-23,bEcUIEcRE25IIfxv8OiXtO,"With China making rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI)-based research, it is imperative that India view AI as a critical element of its national security strategy",competitor,05:19,Why India needs an AI policy

The first ripples were felt in the middle of the last decade and were evidenced by the likes of Salesforce.com and that upstart called Amazon Web Services, Inc. What a curious idea it was for an e-commerce company to expose, and rent out, its underlying infrastructure to third parties! IDC predicts a third of all industry leaders will be replaced by 2020. Thats how profound the disruption is. On the consumer side, the waves intensified towards the end of the decade as social media took centre stage and e-commerce boomed in every single major economy in the world. As I write this, Facebook has nearly 1.8 billion users and Alibaba has sold $18 billion worth of products in a single day. Consumer services companies, vividly exemplifying the sharing economy, have become household brands: today, more millennials possibly identify with Uber and Airbnb than they do with venerable corporations such as Johnson & Johnson, and GE. The force of the sharing economy is reshaping vast tracts of the consumer ecosystem, effecting the closure of retail giants such as Circuit City and Woolworths, and acquisitions such as that of Starwood Hotels by Marriott.The waves are swamping those without the lifeboat of digital capabilities.The first intense wave of change came with technologies which created what IDC calls the third platform of computing. The four pillars of the third platform, namely social, mobile, analytics and cloud (SMAC), today aggregate to a market exceeding $0.5 trillion. According to IDC research, its still expected to grow in excess of 13% in 2016, taking more than 35% of overall technology spending. It accounts for 110% of the industrys growth: traditional IT spending, while still two thirds of overall spend, is shrinking at greater than 5% a year. The third platform of computing is a profound shift in the computing paradigm. Users have moved from millions to billions, devices from tens to hundreds of millions and theres enough data generated on Planet Earth to fill up the memory of a stack of Apple iPads all the way to the moon and back. SMAC technologies have transformed IT fundamentally, and opened up entirely new opportunities for businesses. From smart products to analytics businesses and from real-time system enabled mobile field forces to digital supply chains, businesses across the spectrum have embraced these in different ways to drive economic value. The maturing of the third platform of computing has enabled entirely new technologies, and combinations, to develop and mature. IDC collectively calls them the innovation accelerators, as our research identifies their potential to drive not just technology and process but also complete business disruption. Of these technologies, the following five are likely to take centre stage in India in 2017. Watch out for them.Next gen securityIf youre like me and have a continuous wrestling match with your store of forgotten capital letter-alphanumericchange-them-every-two-weeks passwords, then I can give you some comfort. The era of the complicated password will soon pass. Next generation security systems are integrating biometrics (fingerprint, voice, iris recognition) with behavioural analytics (usage location, onsite/on-app behaviour, transaction patterns) to help make bank accounts, health records, government databases and countless other stores of sensitive information ever more secure. Though not visible to most, the security of the networks our data whizzes around on, and of the data centres which power up the modern economy, is also undergoing radical modernization. For example, network security is not just about appliances detecting bad actors anymore: its moving to a managed services model where the network is monitored for bad actors, real-time responses become a reality and damage control processes kick in instantly in the event of a hack. From Apples fingerprint readers to behavioural security platforms being introduced by the likes of Intel Security and Cisco, the industry is racing to help us realize the possibilities these technologies unlock. Expect a new paradigm in security to make life easier, and more secure, for you in 2017 and beyond. Cognitive systemsThe notion of intelligent machines has fascinated man for decades. It has been the subject of Hollywood movies, science fiction books and doomsday theories. Well, theyve arrived but not in the way you thought. I must stress that intelligent machines of the current generation do not have native intelligence as humans do. They are getting smarter on the back of their ability to process vast quantities of data really fast, and identify patterns and trends to be used. Who knows what the next generation of machines brings, though?A common example is the May I help you? assistants, which have appeared on e-commerce websites. Increasingly, you are not interacting with a human but a piece of software if you do ask a question. It has been programmed with learning algorithms, and fed masses of product catalogue and user behaviour data to be able to help you. Intelligent machines are also parsing through all the published legal cases and court decisions in recorded history to help lawyers serve their clients better; and doing exactly the same with doctors trying to figure out what might be wrong with a sick patient. IBMs Watson platform is perhaps the best known in this space, but its not the only one. Google has a different approach with the TensorFlow and Google Cloud Machine Learning combination. The analytics platforms from the likes of SAS are evolving too, as are new-age data storage systems from NetApp, HP Enterprise and their peers. The year 2017 will see consumer services firms in different sectors adopting cognitive technologies more aggressively. Expect the likes of banks, e-commerce companies, telecom service providers and hospitals to deploy them faster than others. From a wider perspective, the full story will unfold in 2018-19. Internet of Things (IoT)The Internet today has enabled interactions and engagement in society in ways which were not imagined even a decade ago. Video calling through the phone at practically zero marginal cost, cloud computing which allows organizations to think at global scale without the need for massive technology investments and a plethora of consumer services at your doorstep are just three manifestations of the amazing power of the Internet.The next wave is now upon us: machines are now interacting with each other and triggering processes without human intervention. In the process, mountains of data are being generated daily, enabling machine learning and cognitive computing. This is IoT. The 2016 IDC IoT survey in India, which covered 470 companies, reveals a great enthusiasm for IoT already. Process manufacturing companies as well as logistics services and trucking firms are leading the way. The Industrial Internet is born. The year 2017 is likely to see the inflection point of IoT adoption in India. Billions of sensors will help monitor oil pipelines remotely, control home air-conditioning systems and track trucks and pallets as they move through our vast countryside. Its potential is staggering, its promise mouth-watering. It can generate crores of rupees worth of efficiencies and productivity gains in the corporate sector; for consumers, it could mean being able to switch on your air conditioner before you reach home; or your coffee machine grinding the beans when the sensors in your bedroom note that youve up.  3D printingAt a recent conference, Anand Mahindra, chairman of the Mahindra Group, shared that they had put a 3D printer in a school as part of corporate social responsibility and R&D initiatives. The group was keen to see what innovation the children might come up with if they are given the right tools. The results are awaited but early signs are promising. The term 3D printing, in some ways, is a misnomer. They are actually capital goods equipment which operate visually like printers do. In the future, this technology is likely to radically remake manufacturing. Supply chains will be disrupted and the manufacturing process for many products will be democratized, with the possibility of garage-based production and retail store production already being realized. Nikes Fly Knit shoes are made in-shop after your foot is scanned and the images sent to the 3D printer. Skin grafts have been synthesized in labs; auto parts are being 3D printed. In 2017, we will see the gradual influx of these machines into manufacturing firms, research labs and the possible odd hospital. It will take some time and price cuts before 3D printers go mainstream. But it holds much promise and would be especially useful for far-flung areas of the nation. Natural user interfacesWhat I wouldnt give to not have to get up for the remote control, and simply change the channel on the television with a swipe of my hand, or through a conveniently placed gadget that would recognize my voice and change the channel! Thats Natural User Interface (NUI) for you and its here to stay. But really, while that TV remote is still important, a lot of what we experience is now being redefined by new forms of cognitive controls. The shift from text to graphics was a major leap, courtesy of Xerox Corpo ration, and popularised by Apple with their hallmark Macintosh OS in 1984. More recently, weve witnessed a revolution of sorts in the UI space: touch (smartphones), voice (Siri) and even gesture (Microsoft Kinect, Nintendo Wii).Today consumers want amplified, immersive and authentic experiences from what they consume; NUI enables just that. The human-machine interface is fast changing our experiences, thus heralding an era of multi-touch surfaces, powerful and lightweight mobile devices and now the emerging market of wearable technology. We are entering a fascinating world sans constraints physical and virtual.On the enterprise side, firms today are increasing the connect with their ecosystem of customers, employees, suppliers and partners, moving away from mere CX (customer experience) to authentic experiences. At IDC, were seeing this extensively in media and gaming; it is a matter of time before NUI permeates retail, healthcare, fashion and automobile verticals. It is my considered view that when the neural capabilities of touch, voice and gesture and the capable hardware thats available to process these inputs (at consumer prices to boot) are coupled with the large scale APIs to leverage these NUI opportunities, a new age of platforms which can redesign and revolutionize your experience will dawn. 2017 shall be a year when the increasing clamour for experience by consumers and the omni-experience transformation needs of enterprises shall see a scaling up of investments towards this aim. As this technology transformation evolves, so too will its impact on consumer experience and the digital business ecosystem.In sum, 2017 will see the next technological revolution reshaping Indian society, business and the government landscape. Recent events have already triggered the digitalization of the payments ecosystem at warp speed. The five technologies described above, individually and in combination, will herald the dawn of the next technological age.Jaideep Mehta is managing director, IDC India and South Asia.Five trends that can change the tech world by 2021Internet-of-things (IoT) software and solutions: IoT will be driving new levels of customer insight and engagement for some by 2021, but technology diversity and the need for organizational changes will still stymie or delay many firms. Intelligent agents: Intelligent agents and related robots will have eliminated a net 6% of jobs by 2021. Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR): By 2021, AR will be commonplace, while VR will remain niche. Artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive technology: Solutions powered by AI/cognitive technology will displace jobs with the biggest impact felt in transportation, logistics, customer service, and consumer services.Hybrid wireless: 5G will be rolling out by 2021, creating a high-bandwidth cellular backbone to support IoT devices.

-0.39,"Steve Hasker, global president and chief operating officer at Nielsen Holding plc, was in India to meet clients and speak on the growing importance of mobile in advertising at the Mobile Marketing Association conference in Gurgaon. 
				   
				During the trip, he met executives from PepsiCo, Nestle, Reckitt Benckiser, Tata group, BARC India and Facebook, among others.India is a very important market for us. The visit was to ensure our success continues and we stay connected with clients, Hasker said as he explained the importance of Nielsens newly launched Total Audience Measurement tool in the US. Edited excerpts:What does Total Audience Measurement include?Total Audience Measurement, thats been launched in the US, has the ability to measure any piece of video, audio or text, on any device at any time and to do it seamlessly and consistently. It has an advertising measurement component and a content measurement component and the ability to put them together. It obviously has a TV, PC, connected device and tablet, and smartphone component and in the US, we have rolled out all those pieces.Here in India, we have started with the digital ad ratings. So, we started with the advertising component. In the coming months, we look to launch the content ratings. But Total Audience Measurement is more than just digital?What Total Audience Measurement does is, it takes all the digital touch points and combines with TV advertising. So, for any campaign, an agency will say, okay, I should think about TV relative to these digital touch points. Should I buy more TV or less TV? This is very important because different markets have different objectives in terms of reach and frequency. Right now, Total Audience Measurement is available in the US; but we have also launched in Mexico and a version of it in Brazil.When will you introduce it in India?To a large extent, that is dependent on BARC (Broadcast Audience Research Council). They have the TV data. In theory, we could do it today because BARC data and digital ad ratings are consistent; but it requires an advertiser to put those two together.Is linear TV declining?What we have seen in a number of countries is the pressure on TV ratings. The size and frequency of audiences watching television has come under pressure in some of the more developed markets like the US, UK and Australia. And that has meant growth in terms of time spent on digital devices. However, what marketers are trying and have now started to understand is that TV has a reasonably unique value proposition in terms of the ability to tell a story to consumers in a way that is accepted by them. And that many large brand campaigns need a TV component. So, the ability to come out of TV altogether and going to digital was overstated. Particularly in 2016 in many markets, we have seen a reversion back to TV and more reliance on TV from an advertising perspective. But the UK and US numbers suggest digital ad revenue has surpassed TV numbers.In the UK, digital surpassed TV a number of years ago; and in the US, it has surpassed in the past 18 months. Those numbers are for real. But this year, in what we call the upfronts which is the mechanism of buying and selling advertising on TV in US, we have seen some reversion back to TV. What a number of major advertisers found that they probably swung the pendulum too far toward digital; and in doing so, they saw some decrease in reach of their campaigns to their target audience. Was losing Indias TV market to BARC a big setback for Nielsen?We certainly enjoyed being part of the TAM joint venture (between Nielsen and Kantar Media owned by WPP Plc) for quite a long period of time. We are very supportive of BARC. We met BARC and have a good relationship. Wed like to help them if we can. So we are looking forward. We think therell be an opportunity to do that. Which are the successful digital models globally? What we have seen in the last couple of years in the US and many countries is the emergence of truly spectacular digital models. One of course is Google with its search model thats been extended to YouTube. And the second is Facebook. In fact, Google, Facebook and, increasingly, Snapchat are proving to be very successful digital models partly because they have attracted disproportionate amounts of consumer time and attention and partly because they have an economic model which is very efficient. Facebook announced last week it had 4 million advertisers. And one of the great things about Facebook and Google platforms is that for an advertiser, they are extremely easy to use. You can target a particular audience and you can buy using your credit card So for advertisers and agencies, it is a great model. It is also a highly profitable model.What about newspaper publishers?It is more difficult for traditional publishersnewspapers or magazines or what we call pure play digital content websites and portals because the audiences access their content through Google, Facebook and Snapchat. In other words, the means in which they get content is through one of these larger players and, secondly, the time and attention is smaller on their properties.So, whats their future?In an increasingly fragmented and complicated world, great journalism, great video production, great TV production is not easier to do. So, even though we have got this great democratization of information and it is freely available in many different places, the ability to interpret news and write insightful commentary around the news, does not become easier in that environment. So, the value attached to that goes up not down.Whats happened here is that theres been a significant disruption in the distribution mechanism; so, whether it is a newspaper or a TV channel , or magazine, consumers now have many different ways to get to that content but, ultimately, the content itself has to be incredibly valuable. And now, done properly, there are more ways to monetize great journalism than there were previously. Right now, what media formats is venture capital (VC) chasing?VCs are very good at sniffing out areas of growth. So they are focused on a couple of thingsone is video. That is, players who are in the digital video space, either producing or distributing video content. Secondly, they are focused on players who have interesting data setson consumer identity or consumer behaviourpurchase behaviour or media consumption behaviour. The other place VCs are more focused on is fintechlike mobile payments and also on healthcare related apps and start-ups.Nielsen acquired Indicus Analytics in India. Are you eyeing more firms here?We would like to make more, provided they enhance our business and make sense financially. For us, India is a very important market. What is the next big thing for Nielsen?The big area of focus for us will be the connected system. We have two businesses. One measures media behaviour, the other measures consumption of consumer packaged goods and provides all kinds of analytics around that. In the media business, the big investment is Total Audience Measurement, and, as we said, we have rolled that out in many countries and we are in the process of bringing that to India. The second area is to build the connected system which links the market share data to explanatory analytics. Say, for instance, did the market share of Kinley water go up because of better product innovation like a new bottle size, different packaging or concept, or did it go up because its marketing has been more effectivetheres been more money on digital and more money on TV. Or did it go up because of in-store execution, its pricing, promotion and assortment was better. So, the connected system will, in real time, enable the brand manager of a particular brand to understand how am I doingwhat happened, why did it happen and what should I do next.So, were in the process of prototyping this with a number of clients across the world and we would look to introduce this here in India sometime next year. We are piloting it with six clients at the moment in different parts of the world. This is our biggest area of investment for the next five years.",2016-10-17,bNj32jkOPJkyiWyZYj8wxO,"India is a very important market for Nielsen, says global president and chief operating officer Steve Hasker",competitor,01:41,Some digital advertising is moving back to TV: Nielsens Steve Hasker
0.41,"Mumbai: Aster DM Healthcare Ltd, which runs hospitals in India, the Philippines, and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, is likely to defer its proposed initial public offering (IPO) because of concerns over valuation of its overseas operations from which the company derives a large part of its revenues, two people aware of the development said on condition of anonymity. 
				   
				Aster DM had filed for an IPO in June last year and had received approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in November. According to the people cited above, the company was looking to raise close to $300 million from the IPO, valuing the company at around $2.5 billion. The IPO was planned for early this year, before the end of the March quarter.The key reason for the delay in the IPO is the current market condition of its overseas business, especially in Saudi Arabia, which has been badly hit by the fall of oil prices, said one of the two people. As a result, the company has decided that going ahead with the IPO will adversely impact its valuation. It has asked bankers involved in the IPO process to go slow till further notice, the person added.Responding to an email query, a spokesperson of Aster DM said, There is no change in IPO plans and we will look to launch the IPO at an appropriate time, subject to market and business considerations. The company did not disclose any timeline for the proposed IPO. In contrast, mattress maker Sheela Foam Ltd, which received Sebi approval for its IPO around the same time as Aster DM, listed successfully in December, raising around Rs510 crore.In its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP), Aster DM disclosed that its overseas revenues might be impacted due to fall in oil prices globally. The company said that in Saudi Arabia, where a substantial portion of its revenues are derived from patients referred and funded by the ministry of health, a decline in oil prices and the overall economic conditions have had a direct impact, resulting in an increase in receivables from the ministry of health. In order to counter this, the company said it was exploring other business opportunities in Saudi Arabia, including increasing its share of private insurance and walk-in patients. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully secure alternative sources of revenue in Saudi Arabia, or at all, the company disclosed in the draft prospectus.Aster DM has a diversified portfolio of healthcare facilities, consisting of six hospitals, 83 clinics and 180 retail pharmacies in the Gulf Cooperation Council states, seven multi-speciality hospitals and three clinics in India, and one clinic in the Philippines as of 31 March 2016. Asters hospitals in India are located in Kochi, Kolhapur, Kozhikode, Kottakkal, Bengaluru and Hyderabad and are operated under the Aster, MIMS or Prime brands. Its clinics in India are located at Kozhikode and Bengaluru.Aster DMs operations in India, which primarily consist of hospitals, accounted for only 12.52% of the companys total revenues in the nine months ending 31 December 2015, according to the draft prospectus. For the financial year 2014-15, GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries contributed Rs3,447.8 crore to revenue, compared with a contribution of Rs427.9 crore by the Indian operations. The company has received investments from PE funds Olympus Capital Asia Investments Ltd and True North (previously known as India Value Fund Advisors). Both PE funds were expected to dilute a part of their stake along with the promoters in the IPO.Since December 2016, four healthcare services firms have tapped the primary markets to fund their expansion plans and provide an exit to their PE investors. Collectively, these firmsDr Lal Pathlabs Ltd, Narayana Hrudayalaya Ltd, HealthCare Global Enterprises Ltd and Thyrocare Technologies Ltdhave raised almost Rs2,375 crore. In December, a Mint report citing Investec, a global specialist banking group, said that Indias healthcare sector will see investors looking to exit close to $3 billion of primary investments in the next two-three years through secondary sales and public market listings.",2017-02-03,bOEhXYcgzr8pWHdBOVb78K,"Aster DM Healthcare was looking to raise close to $300 million from the IPO, valuing the company at around $2.5 billion ",company,00:50,Aster DM defers IPO plans over valuation concerns of overseas operations 
0.5,"A revolution is brewing in the financial ecosystem that will extend the benefits of formal financial services to the masses. Global trends suggest that the banking and financial services sector are undergoing the change that the telecom sector witnessed a few years ago. A number of OTT (over-the-top) players came up with innovative solutions to provide a comprehensive communication experience. They leveraged the infrastructure created by telecom service providers and provided value-added services to consumers. Similar innovation is happening in payments and other financial services.
				   
				Traditionally, the banking system has had a stringent regulatory environment. This is beginning to change as regulators take cognizance of the innovation in the area. Companies providing value-added services over and above bank accounts for customers are getting good traction. These companies are coming up with constantly improving technology, data analytics and lean processes to provide high-quality services at an economical cost. Financial services can be divided broadly into two segments. The first category consists of frequently used services like payments, cash in, cash out, etc. These services will witness innovation in the area of customer experience. For example, payment being made through a QR (quick response) code-based solution enhances the experience of making a payment and has the potential of reducing a consumers reliance on cash. The second category consists of long-haul services like lending, insurance and cash management. This category will witness innovation that can extend the reach of these services to the masses. A company giving a personal loan based on utility-bill payment history or extending a working capital loan to a merchant based on its digital transaction history comes in this category. Companies are banking on their ability to provide such services to a hitherto untouched market. In India, the pace of this change is even more rapid due to the favourable combination of a government policy environment, a progressive banking regulator and the emergence of innovative fintech companies. The percolation of financial services to every citizen will happen the way it did with telecom services. The pace will only accelerate. Aadhaar is going to play an important role in this change. Innovation and regulation balance out each other and grow together. Innovation solves restrictions and regulation sets boundaries to safeguard consumers. When both innovation and the regulatory environment move in sync, the service delivery goes to the next level. The emergence of wallets, payment banks and small finance banks is the result of such synchronous movement of innovation and regulation.A large segment of the population will enjoy the benefits of formal financial services for the first time. The first step in this direction has already been taken with Jan Dhan accounts. Digital payments through various instruments like wallets, UPI (unified payment interface), cards, etc, are growing consistently. The last few months have demonstrated that consumers are willing to become digitally savvy if the right solutions are provided. A critical mass of consumers and merchants is getting comfortable with digital payments and apprehensions have reduced significantly in a short span. This is leading to a network effect and unprecedented growth in the digital ecosystem.Digital payments are leading to access to credit through formal channels for consumers and merchants who were unable to get this benefit till now. There is similar innovation in the areas of insurance and wealth management, where the focus is on increasing penetration of these services. For, services like wealth management have remained limited to a select segment. Technology companies are developing ways to provide such services to consumers irrespective of the quantum of their wealth. This is being made possible through technology innovation that renders the incremental cost of acquiring and servicing a customer negligible. Effectively, the reach of financial services and consumer experience is going to improve drastically in the country.Vijay Shekhar Sharma is the founder of PaytmThis is part of a series of articles in Mints 10th anniversary special issue that look at India 10 years from now.

-0.03,"Bata India Ltd hasnt had it easy.
				   
				In the last few quarters, weaker spending trends, supply chain issues and fierce competition from the online platform have weighed on the companys performance.But valuations at about 32 times next years estimated earnings are not cheap and the stock has risen 12% from its January lows.In the near future, therefore, there are few reasons for further appreciation.According to Ambit Capital Pvt. Ltd, under-investment in brand (Rs.110 crore over FY09-15) and over-investment in stores (Rs.500 crore over the same period) will mar asset turns (2.4 times in FY17 from 3.1 times in CY09), with increasing competition fuelled by e-commerce.Additionally, foreign brands pose a direct threat to 12-15% of Batas portfolio and can impede growth of the Power brand, pointed out Ambit, adding that every 5% fall in Powers revenues alone will impact earnings per share by 3%.Power is a sports shoes brand.It goes without saying that the impact on earnings will be greater if online competition eats into other parts of the product portfolio as well.In any case, the subdued macroeconomy means that substantial improvement in same-store sales growth will be at bay for some time.The companys performance for the year so far is not encouraging. For the nine months to December, Bata Indias revenue increased about 10%, compared with last year. However, a faster pace of growth in costs and a decline in other income meant pre-tax and exceptional items earnings declined nearly 10%.What can offer some comfort?Store rationalization is one factor. We understand that replacing its earlier aggressive store expansion strategy, Bata is adopting a calibrated approach in widening its retail footprint, wrote analysts from Spark Capital Advisors (India) Pvt. Ltd in a note to clients on 26 February.Secondly, optimizing rent expenses will be helpful in boosting earnings growth.We realize that not only are rental leases being re-negotiated to take advantage of the subdued real estate environment, but store sizes are also being optimized to drive efficiency, the Spark note said.According to the brokerage, Batas rental cost has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of ~24% versus ~14% revenue growth in CY10-FY16E, pegging rental at ~13.9% of sales in FY15 versus ~9% in CY10.

0.25,"Reliance Industries Ltds (RILs) March quarter results were better than estimates, but only just. Its stand-alone Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) last quarter stood at Rs.10,727 crore, or about 3% higher than consensus estimates. According to a Bloomberg poll of analysts, Ebitda was estimated at Rs.10,394 crore.
				   
				In fact, some brokerage firms such as Kotak Institutional Equities had estimated Ebitda of over Rs.10,700 crore, on the back of strong margins in the petrochemicals segment. As it turns out, margins in the petrochemicals business were strong at 14%, far higher than 10.6% for the March quarter last year. Petrochemicals Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margins were higher due to strong product deltas (rate of change in prices compared with the change in unit costs) and low absolute product prices. Petrochemicals Ebit increased 29% due to strength in polymer deltas, robust polymer demand and higher volumes in the polyester chain.Besides, RILs gross refining margin (GRM) at $10.8 a barrel was marginally higher than many analysts estimates. For instance, Morgan Stanley Research and BNP Paribas Securities (Asia) Ltd were expecting GRM of $10.6 per barrel and $10.5 a barrel, respectively. While the companys GRM has declined on a sequential basis, this was expected, considering that benchmark Singapore GRM had also declined compared with the December quarter. Whats more, the company has managed to maintain its premium over Singapore GRMs at $3.5 a barrel, as in the December quarter. Strong gasoline and naphtha cracks, robust demand growth and favourable crude markets helped boost refining margins, the company said. Higher utilization rates also helped.On a consolidated basis, while RILs organized retail business has seen a smart 26% year-on-year Ebit growth, this was offset by a sharp drop in the oil and gas segment Ebit (97% year-on-year decline). The stand-alone oil and gas business reported losses at the Ebit level due to lower realization for liquids and a decline in production, while a drop in prices affected the companys US shale operations.As pointed out earlier, the results were largely on expected lines and dont do much to move the needle as far as the stocks valuations go. Currently, one RIL share trades at 11 times its estimated earnings for this fiscal year. In the near-term though, the fact that refining margin has declined may cloud sentiments for the stock. So far, quarter-to-date, Singapore GRM has averaged at $5.2 a barrel, according to an analyst, compared with $7.7 in the March quarter. Of course, it would help if petrochemical margins remain steady.However, over the medium term, the outlook for the stock may turn positive as investors start looking at higher earnings on account of RILs expansion plans. As Amit Shah of BNP Paribas writes in a recent report, the benefit of expansion of petchem capacities, pet-coke and refinery off-gas cracker projects would be visible from FY18 onwards.But on the other hand, the prospects of the telecom business remain an uncertainty. BNP, for instance, has not assigned any value to RILs telecom business in its sum-of-parts valuation. Undoubtedly, analysts and investors will keep a close watch on Reliance Jios launch and pricing strategy.The writer does not have positions in the companies discussed here.",2016-04-23,bUc8KvnZEHZiYT4PcJq4BL,"Results were largely on expected lines and didnt do much to affect the RIL stocks valuations

-0.24,"New Delhi: State-owned explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) said on Saturday it will invest Rs78,000 crore in the Krishna Godavari basin for producing hydrocarbons and has signed an agreement with the Andhra Pradesh government for smooth execution of the projects. 
				   
				ONGC has been pursuing exploration in the basin and had last March announced a $5 billion (Rs34,000 crore) investment over the next three years in two of its fields there after the central government earlier that month announced a liberal pricing formula for natural gas from deep sea blocks. The investment figure announced on Saturday is for the entire basin. The agreement with Andhra Pradesh to take forward all critical exploration and production activities in the state was signed on the sidelines of the Partnership Summit, 2017 jointly organized by the state government and industry chamber Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in Visakhapatnam on Friday.ONGC sees Andhra Pradesh as a hydrocarbon rich state. ONGC is very aggressively pursuing to put the huge gas reserves it has discovered in KG basin, to production. It plans to invest about Rs10,000 crore for exploration and production activities in onland blocks and about Rs68,000 crore in offshore assets in the KG Basin, said a company statement. As per the deal, the state government will assist ONGC in taking over land and in obtaining other statutory clearances.

-0.81,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. reported revenues of $3.19 billion for the September quarter, marginally higher than the Streets estimate of $3.16 billion. On a sequential basis, revenues grew by 3.3%, which again doesnt look impressive for the traditionally strong September quarter. After the June quarters impressive 6% sequential growth, investors are evidently feeling let down.
				   
				But these quibbles aside, Cognizants results reiterate the fact that the company has been miles ahead of the competition this year. On a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, its revenues grew by 16.5%, after adjusting for incremental revenues from the TriZetto Corp. acquisition. In comparison, industry leader Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) grew revenues by just 5.8% y-o-y. Infosys Ltd grew revenues by 7.6% and Wipro Ltds growth stood at just 3.4%.Just a year ago, TCSs growth was higher by about 300 basis points, when it was growing at a healthy pace of almost 15%. But while its growth has slipped sharply in the past four quarters, Cognizant has done just the opposite. The latters growth rate is now almost 11 percentage points higher, an unusually high differential in an industry that is so competitive. One basis point is 0.01%.Also note that Cognizant has raised its revenue growth guidance for 2015 each quarter, for the past three quarters, while analysts have been cutting growth estimates for most Indian tech leaders. Cognizant has benefited from not having any material exposure to troubled sectors such as energy and telecom. But thats not the only reason for its outperformance. There has also been a shift in the nature of IT spending in the past year, and Cognizant, with its higher exposure to discretionary services such as consulting (58% of revenues last quarter), has gained. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a recent note to clients, Companies with inherent strength in run-the-business services are struggling to sustain momentum, while those with greater exposure to discretionary spending are gaining. Last quarter, the so-called run-the-business part of Cognizants portfolio grew by 1.5% sequentially, while growth in segments that depend on discretionary spending stood three times higher at 4.6%.As pointed out earlier in this column, Cognizant appears to have made disproportionate gains in the trend towards increasing spend on digital services. According to analysts, the companys early investments in this segment, including acquisitions it has made in the space, coupled with its consulting expertise, has helped it gain a higher share of this relatively new revenue stream.Its not that others havent had any success. TCS said after its September quarter results that revenues from digital services grew by 10% sequentially last quarter. Be that as it may, overall revenue growth numbers suggest that Cognizant has gained considerable market share this year, at the expense of large India-based IT companies. Last quarter, its incremental revenues of $426 million (on a y-o-y basis) were nearly double that of TCSs ($227 million), and higher than the cumulative incremental revenues of TCS and Infosys.This clear divergence is also reflected in the way these stocks have moved in the past yearCognizants shares have risen by over 35%, while those of TCS have fallen by 3%.",2015-11-04,beBSWzL5LdrIGeZM5tmu3H,"Cognizants results reiterate the fact that the company has been miles ahead of competition this year

-0.2,"The inordinate delay in Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds commercial launch is giving incumbents time in preparing for the coming onslaught. They first incentivized data consumption by cutting rates only for non-peak hours with so-called night plans. This week, Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd increased data benefits on some of their pre-paid data recharge packs. Vodafone India Ltd hasnt bothered to respond yet. 
				   
				These arent signs of an industry desperately adjusting to the reality of a new large entrant; instead, the moves by incumbents suggest a carefully calibrated strategy that is aimed at ultimately blunting the price advantage of Reliance Jio. Consider the latest changes in pricing. Most headlines screamed Bharti, Idea cut data tariffs by 67%; but this is far from the truth. To start with, these companies havent cut tariffs by 67%; they have increased data benefits by 67%. And that too, only in some packs. Its important to note that the majority of data subscribers use plans ranging from 500MB to 1.5GB, with the flagship plan being the 1GB plan. The latest changes in tariffs havent touched this plan at all. In other words, incumbents arent yet ready to sacrifice revenues and margins with their flagship plans. Idea Cellular has inched towards making its data services more affordable in this segmentits 2GB plan now comes at the cost of the earlier 1.5GB plan. But clearly, theres no hurry to cut prices meaningfully in the most popular plans and drive volume growth. Also Read: Reliance Jio to go for Rs15,000 crore rights issue

This column has pointed out earlier that growth in data volumes has dropped sharply in recent quarters. For the top three telcos, incremental data volumes fell to 14,680 terabytes in the March quarter, compared with an average of 31,230 terabytes in the preceding four quarters. In this backdrop, its imperative that incumbents cut tariffs meaningfully to attract new customers and drive consumption. But it now looks like these significant changes in pricing will happen only after Reliance Jio launches. Evidently, incumbents dont want to play all their cards upfront.For now, they are teasing subscribers to increase data consumption by reducing the price of larger packs (exceeding 2GB). Considering that these companies are running under-utilised networks, these incentives dont entail additional costs. As such, revenues and margins are pretty much protected.But what this effective reduction in prices for larger packs does is that it further blunts the price advantage that Reliance Jio can offer when it eventually launches operations. Of course, theres no limit to how low Reliance Jio can go with prices to win market share. Even so, with the every successive calibration in data tariffs, incumbents have managed to reduce the extent to which Reliance Jio can disrupt the market.",2016-07-21,beknhdWUSzBNA8rY1yyXGJ,"Moves of Incumbents suggest a carefully calibrated strategy that is aimed at ultimately blunting the price advantage of Reliance Jio

				The impetus for this growth came from the southern marketsmainly from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, where a new capital is coming up. A healthy pick-up in infrastructure projectsmostly government wardsalso led to an increase in cement demand. Thus, south India-based cement firms such as India Cements Ltd and Ramco Cement Ltd gained more. The latters operating profit margin soared to an industry high of 31% in the March quarter.Overall, cement shipments grew nearly 11% from a year ago in the March quarter. The big question now is whether this is a one-off or sustainable?The consensus seems to be saying fiscal 2017 will tend to be better than the previous year. This would be largely driven by the governments increased public spending and initiatives such as housing for all, smart cities mission and a dedicated freight corridor.But thats not saying much.Nobody expects the real estate sector to turn around. So, there is unlikely to be any significant demand in housing. Both rural and urban housing demand is likely to remain muted in FY17. The governments infrastructure push would not be adequate to sustain this demand; private investment also must rise.Overall, India Ratings Ltd see cement demand growing 4-6% in FY17. Cement firms themselves anticipate a 6-8% rise. All this again depends on a good monsoon after two years of drought.The margins also may not be sustainable. In the immediate quarter, the input costs may remain under check, but energy and commodity prices have already started to climb. Secondly, given the overcapacity in the industry, cement firms dont seem to have much pricing power, too. Yes, there was a strong increase in cement prices in the March quarter; but after that, the hikes have been muted. All-India average cement prices have improved merely by around 1% month-on-month, said a Reliance Securities note. For prices to rise further, a substantial improvement in demand is needed.

It was also lower, compared with sales in July.Ashok Leyland Ltd, the second largest truck and bus maker, reported a 7.9% drop in sales in overall M&HCV sales, too.This is not sudden.Tata Motors sales hit a roadblock in May. It has not recovered since. Sales of Ashok Leyland have been sliding, too. One could argue that the segment clocked heady growth for nearly two years before falling and, hence, the high base has challenged growth prospects.If M&HCV and auto sales reflect the state of economy, then it questions the sustainability of green shoots of economic recovery, too.Further, although manufacturing in select sectors that back consumption has picked up, it has not enthused investment demand and capital expenditure.Further, heavy industries such as construction and mining are still limping.India Ratings adds that the robust growth in M&HCV sales in FY15 and FY16 was perhaps pent-up demand.Meanwhile, truck rentals have also fallen in the past few months.One could blame this on the cut in diesel prices in the recent past and a heavy monsoon that may have disrupted the movement of goods.However, a note by Reliance Securities on the sales numbers for August says that replacement demand, which was robust a few quarters ago after the long lull in truck sales, has tapered off. Meanwhile, the inadequate rise in freight rates and a slow pick-up in construction activity, along with a high FY16 base, has kept truck sales subdued. Growth in light commercial vehicle sales, though rising, has also moderated.Fleet operators appear to have another concern, too. The new goods and services tax (GST), when introduced, will no doubt reduce logistics hurdles and reduce time at check posts, thereby improving fleet productivity, too.So, perhaps operators may not feel the need to expand until GST comes into existence.A Tata Motors presentation highlighting its June quarter performance says growth in the freight rate index shows a decelerating trend since the December quarter of FY15 on the back of weak economic activity.This may weigh down on truck sales, unless there is a post-monsoon revival in economic activity.For now, one hopes that it is a seasonal blip.All eyes are, therefore, on the second half of FY17, which should set the pace of growth for commercial vehicles.",2016-09-04,buuWX52Vy2iLRf58Gq3n1M,Not only does the decline weigh down on investor sentiment towards this segmentwhich was the first to turn around in the auto sectorit also raises questions on the strength of the economic recovery,company,20:18,Drop in truck sales a reason for worry
-0.35,"New Delhi: India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) launched on Monday by the Union finance minister Arun Jaitley is the second payments bank to commence its operation in the country after Airtel Payments Bank (APB), which was launched on January 12.
				   
				IPPB has been set up as a 100% Indian government-owned public limited company under the department of posts with the aim to open around 650 new branches in postal district headquarters. Currently, the department of posts has an existing network of around 1,55,000 post offices. The new branches will be co-located with the existing post offices. On Monday, it launched services on a pilot basis in Raipur and Ranchi.APB, on the other hand, is a joint venture between phone services provider Bharti Airtel Ltd and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. The payments bank went live with a network of 250,000 banking points. In the pilot phase, the bank added over 1 million customers, according to a statement by the company. As mandated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the new model of banking focuses on providing basic financial services such as all kinds of payments; including social security payments, utility bill payments, remittance services, current and saving accounts up to a balance of Rs1 lakh, distribution of insurance, mutual funds, pension products and acting as business correspondent to other banks for credit products especially in rural areas and among the underserved segments of the society.However, there are distinct differences in the business models of both the payments bank. Mint compares the charges levied and interest rates offered by both the payments banks for rendering different services, including deposits and withdrawals.APB charges Rs5 to Rs25 for cash withdrawals less than Rs4,000 and 0.65% of the withdrawal amount which is equal to or greater than Rs4,000. IPPB does not charge anything for cash withdrawals from its branches and ATMs. However, it charges Rs15-35 for rendering doorstep banking (cash based) for both deposits and withdrawals up to Rs10, 000.The remittance charges levied by both the banks also differ. APB lists charges for transactions made through internet banking, through the app and USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) or *99# whereas IPPB also recognizes transactions through NEFT (National Electronic Funds Transfer), IMPS (Immediate Payment Service), AEPS (Aadhaar enabled payments system) and UPI (Unified Payments Interface).Only transactions up to Rs10, 000 is permitted through AEPS which is free. According to IPPB, banking charges at branch and doorstep for each NEFT based transaction ranges from Rs2.5-5 and Rs5 is charged for every transaction via IMPS.APB charges 0.5% of the amount transferred within its payments bank whereas 1% of the amount transferred is charged for transfer of funds from APB to other bank accounts through banking points.Customers of IPPB can withdraw amount up to Rs10,000 from an ATM in a single transaction and up to Rs25,000 per day. APB, on the other hand, has set Rs10 as the minimum cash withdrawal amount, there is no clarity on the upper limit to cash withdrawals.APB offers an high interest rate of 7.25% p.a. on deposits on savings accounts which is higher than the interest rate offered by traditional banks on fixed deposits.IPPBs interest rates have been fixed as 4.5% if the quarterly average balance is up to Rs25,000, 5% if it is between Rs25,000 and Rs50,000, and 5.5% if above Rs50,000.",2017-01-31,bvQa9dbOiZxQA6DBXNazoJ,A comparison of the charges levied and interest rates offered by India Post Payments Bank and Airtel Payments Bank for rendering different services,competitor,10:02,How does India Post Payments Bank stack up against Airtel Payments Bank

-0.04,"Given the rally in commodity prices and the tepid sales growth across auto companies, auto manufacturers put up a decent operating performance for the June quarter.
				   
				On an average, the gross margin, after accounting for only raw material costs, declined. However, most firms contained staff costs and other expenses to sustain operating profitability at year-ago levels. Within the listed universe, Hero MotoCorp Ltd, the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world, posted the highest operating margin in six years. Bajaj Auto Ltd, too, which makes two- and three-wheelers, excelled on profitability in spite of lower exports.Disappointment came from the most unexpected quarters. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the countrys No. 1 carmaker, had a production setback due to a fire at a vendors plants. Lower sales, adverse currency movement and higher commodity prices together culminated in a contraction in operating margin.Likewise, Tata Motors Ltd, contrary to its usual outperformance in the pack, hugely disappointed the Street, as a negative foreign exchange impact and lower sales incentives for its subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover Plc, along with tepid performance by commercial vehicles and cars in the domestic market, dragged consolidated profit down to about one-third the year-ago period.However, investors are hopeful that these currency adversities wont recur. Two-wheelers are likely to gain from rural offtake after a favourable monsoon and from urban demandan offshoot of higher disposable income with consumers after the 7th pay commissions award of salary and pension hikes to government employees and retirees.The resulting sales boost will improve pricing power, enabling auto makers to pass on cost increases. Discounts, too, are likely to be lower than in the past few quarters.These factors will, at least partially, offset the margin pressure on account of rising costs. Only premium product manufacturers such as Royal Enfield, from the Eicher Motors Ltd stable, would buck margin pressure, as the motorcycles are hardly price-sensitive.Meanwhile, within auto firms, two-wheelers and utility vehicles manufacturers may post better margin traction, going by the July and August sales trend. The one segment that may drag earnings momentum in the sector is medium and heavy vehicles. Here, growth is slowing, given the high year-ago base and also since industrial activity has not picked up to the estimated levels.That said, the Street is quick to discount positives in the auto sector.

0.25,"At a regulators round table at the Mint Annual Banking Conclave held in Mumbai on 23 January,  former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor D. Subbarao and former Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chairman C.B. Bhave talk about the impact of demonetisation, the move towards a cashless economy and the autonomy of RBI in a session moderated by Mints consulting editor Tamal Bandyopadhyay. Edited excerpts: 
After demonetisation, everybody is talking about growth slowing down. The latest one was the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which said 100 basis point growth will be compromised this year, another 150 basis points next year. India will lose the tag of the fastest-growing economy in the world. In fact, Moodys said India will continue to remain the fastest-growing economy. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) estimates say that demonetisation impact will be 50 basis points. Can you please tell me how short will be the short-term pain and how long will it take the long-term gain, and what kind of gain do you see? Subbarao: On the growth numbers itself, I must admit I have not crunched the numbers but I have seen fair estimates, from Dr Manmohan Singh in Parliament saying loss of GDP (gross domestic product) will be 2 percentage points, to RBI saying that it will be 5% but the consensus seems to be above 1 percentage point of GDP. What is quite clear though, on which there is lot of agreement, is even though we might lose some GDP in one year, recovery will be quite V shaped as we are already seeing that V-shaped recovery, there will be no hysteresis in the sense that once economy is remonetised we will get that trend, loss if any will be one-third loss. Of course, that will be a huge loss. Apart from the loss to GDP, hundreds of million less privileged in the country had endured pain and hardship, and also economic loss. Cost of demonetisation has been direct in the short term, the benefits are uncertain and unquantifiable. The question is: Will the net cost-benefit calculus be positive. The hope is that it will be positive provided two things happen. The way I look at two methods I use for assessing the success of demonetisation. The first is to what extent this process destroyed or detected (black money). Second, to what extent is regeneration of black money prevented by demonetisation as everyone has said tax black money, act on time, it does nothing to prevent allegations, it puts a fear like Chinese say they killed a chicken to scare the monkey. So if there is fear in people creating black money that they are going to get penalized, benefits will be quite substantial. So you are saying that demonetisation should not be the end of it, there should be a series of it?Subbarao: Absolutely. You know already in reports about people generating (black) money, all the people who come down the system and are detected to have black money. There should be a trail on them. There should be other mechanisms. GST (goods and services tax) itself might be a big instrument in spotting black money. There should be other audit trails, investigating agency, tax agency. They must use technology. Most of all, the government must create a fear in people that if they indulge in black money creation. If some people are caught in this operation, it would be great. How do you see the economy in the next few quarters? In a democracy, we actually need to create fear to implement thingsis this the right way to do something?Bhave: Firstly, I am not an economist. From what I read of estimates that have come out, nobody has a clue. People are still gauging what the impact will be. As third-quarter results of listed companies come out, we will get some indication. There is about one month and eight days of a quarter, which is normal. Sectors likely to be affected will be cash dependent. Initially, unlisted portion of the economy, informal sectors will be affected more. I neither believe in extreme forecast of 3%, also some people who are saying its marginal impact, I think we are going to land somewhere in between. If you say by 31 March that quarters results will reveal the impact, isnt that too early?Bhave: (With) March results, which will come out in April, you will know two things. One, the full impact of demonetisation disturbance on companies and the way the economy is recovering because we need to know both these things (to know) what kind of debate it is going to have. Lot of people are hoping that the recovery will be V-shaped and you will see the recovery coming up as fast as the downturn came in. I dont know.Do you have anything to say to what Dr Subbarao said about a series of measures as a follow-up and you need to create fear among people, black money hoarders. Is this the way forward? Do you agree with that?Bhave: I agree with Dr Subbarao completely that we need to address the flow problem as well. My take on the issue of corruption is that this is probably the most important issue which we tend to ignore. Secondly that in our conversation we discuss it as something outside of the room, not realizing all of us in the room are responsible directly or indirectly for generation of unaccounted money. This has infested our body politics, our social body to such an extent (where) we are in such a state (that) you have a patient with (his) body entirely infected... lets say, these are the two conditions. You should not operate on so small a part that as soon as you finish the operation, rest of the body gets infected again; you should not operate on such a large body part, that patient himself will be dead. As if these two conditions were not enough, the knife I am giving you has also poison on it, the machine through which you have to implement is also an issue and, therefore, we are only going to find a long-term answer to it. I agree with Dr Subbarao that we need to initiate the step, but dont expect quick results from it.If you remember Prime Ministers 8 November address to the nation, demonetisation was about fighting terror financing, fighting counterfeit notes, terrorism. There was no reference to a cashless economy. There was speculation how much money we will get.  Then we see the lottery is used to promote the drive to cashless.Subbarao: If the objective is only to move the economy to cashless, evidently I believe that the motivation of demonetisation was to assault black money. I was also surprised like Tamal that the government in last two-and-a-half months has talked about different objectives at different times and were somewhat muffled in their communication. I would have been quite happy if they said the intent of demonetisation is to attack black money and there are other incidental benefits of demonetisation such as the transition to a cashless economy to an extent which are consistent with our other objectives.In your book you spoke about how Denmark and Sweden are becoming cashless economies. As a former regulator, what is the right way to go towards a cashless economy? Subbarao: Well it is not that I have done extensive calculation on a cashless economy. I must take some pride that I talked about cashless economy before it became such a popular phrase or slogan in our country. I was talking about a cashless economy, of course the benefits of which come out of it including, creating an audit trail. I was talking more in the context of negative interest rate. You go back one year, January/February last year, the big thing around global economy was how negative interest rate is going to work . It will work if you go towards a cashless economy. It was in that context I was motivated to write about economy. I think it is still possible to go towards a cashless economy and pursue the objective of financial inclusion.From economics to logistics, you spoke about the economics part of it. I would like you to tell us about the logistics part. Being chairman of NSDL (National Securities Depository Ltd), you are somehow the architect of dematerialized shares in India. That was a humongous task at that point of time, physical shares transition to demat, scale was much smaller but there may be some similarities. Are there lessons to be learnt from your demat exercise in terms of sequence?Bhave: Its an interesting question. As you rightly said that we cant really compare the two. When we went in for the demat process, we had about 20 million customers. Today, even if you take the adult population as 500-550 million people, there is that difference. The other important difference is that, in the entire implementation of the demat process ... it was between the regulator and the actors in the demat process like stock exchanges and NSDL, etc. who arrived at most of the decisions. The impact it makes is that when you dont have the sovereign, you cant compel people to do something. You need to do things in the provision of the law. The Demat law said the investor had a choice in either physical or demat form. We had to stay clear of this. Sebi doesnt get as much credit for this work but under (D.R.) Mehtas chairmanship Sebi adopted an absolutely collegial approach to this. We never got the feeling that we were not heard. Third important point is that at such times, the incentive for an actual player is to push for more and more. But in practical terms, considering the size of the country reach it is wiser to go step by step. NSDL played that role, said no many times to higher dematerialization because we advised, we will learn from the mistakes. The last point we made sure small investors were not affected by it. Any shareholder can sell shares up to 500 in physical form. The Regulator always kept its window open. What you do is 80:20 rule, you are pushing 20% but covering 80% of the market. If I paraphrase you, the sovereign should not have much role in the entire exercise. We need to leave it to executives, you need to go through a consulting process, you need to sequence it properly and in certain segments give them enough time.Bhave: Only the first part. I didnt say that the sovereign should not be a part of it. But I said if the sovereign is part of it, you run across the temptation to compelwhere he is not part of the thing that table will be conscious in progressing.Everybody talks about RBI autonomy, what about Sebis autonomy? In 2010 you tested that. There was a fight between the insurance regulator and Sebi, and you lost it. Was that the reason you didnt get a second term. In my interview, you said chairmen come and chairmen go. How independent is this institution and what is your take on that?Bhave: Ultimately any regulatory institution is a creature of law. So it needs to work within parameters of this law. Every single regulatory law in the country has a provision which says the government can issue directive to this regulator to do something. I am just saying autonomy in a sense is circumscribed by this fact that there is an overlapping provision. In practical terms in my mind autonomy comes from how the leadership of the regulator is removable. The Constitution makers wanted the Election Commission, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India to be independent offices, the Supreme Court judges, they made provision that these people can be removed by two-thirds majority of Parliament before their tenure ends.Are you saying its not the institution but the leader that matters? At the end of the day, the buck stops at the leader. The same institution can have less or more autonomy. Whats the wrestling power of the leader?Bhave: The leader matters certainly, you build institutions with the people. You need people who have that assurance and who know they are not subject to arbitrary removal. They have financial autonomy. In practical terms, autonomy is also determined by what kind of personality people are dealing with issues. People who are sensitive to institutional importance would deal with the same issue in a different way. Subbarao: I cant just give a binary answer. I think the perception is much more than the reality. And that perception arises from the fact that there is a section of the law under which the government can issue any instruction to RBI that it considers in public interest, but after consultation with the governor. In the last 80 years of RBI history, Section 7 has been quiet inconsequential. That section has never been invoked. The government has never given any instruction invoking Section 7. The belief that RBI is not autonomous because some section is in law, is completely misread. Sometimes there is pressure on RBI to do things that it is not comfortable in doing. I believe RBI is and should be autonomous in close domains of RBI mandates. Monetary policy, regulation of financial institutions, payment systems on those issues categorically mandate RBI is autonomous and should not bend to the pressure. Over the last eight years from Sir Benegal Rama Rau to Dr Raghuram Rajan, RBI has maintained the tradition of enforcing autonomy.You have agreed that its this perception that RBI ends up compromising Subbarao: There is misinformed perception that RBI doesnt enjoy autonomy and that perception gets strengthened because of repetition. There is responsibility both on part of the government and RBI to manage and improve this perception. Doing what it believes is in the best public interest no matter what the government believes should be done.That is number one. First of all, I think body language used should be very mesh. Second, public criticism of Reserve Bank is powerful of course. RBI is a policy institution, it makes policy that affects the lives of millions of people. But there is one exception. The government should not criticize the RBI governor because that is detrimental to macroeconomic management. If the markets believe that there are differences between the government and RBI, that is not constructive but destructive. The government, if it has any concerns about RBI policy management, that should be internally managed.You said that in the history of RBI, 80 years now and Sebi, 25-plus years, section 7 was never used. I will ask now a counter question. Why do I need to use section 7? If I advise and you listen to me, in a short notice it is actually a threat.Subbarao: I think it is exaggerated. On what basis you say RBI autonomy has been touched upon in question of demonetisation. RBI board has taken half an hour, I dont know exactly. There is no experience. This was a decision that was taken on judgement. There were people on RBI board. I want to ask a counter question. How long does the Union cabinet take to approve the Union budget? 15 minutes. How long does a state cabinet take to approve state budget? 10 minutes. I can tell you because I was finance secretary of state and finance secretary to state governor.I believe that the RBI board must respect that they have taken a considered decision. The governor himself has said that they were in consultation with the government for the past several months. Its like the army preparing for battle and the decision to attack takes place in a very short period of time. That is exactly what has happened, I am not an insider anymore. I believe they have been preparing for long time.",2017-01-30,cEDJ5YKqm297EuY9w9ZsxM,"Former RBI governor D. Subbarao, former Sebi chairman C.B.

				What next for Apples productivity push?Having mended bridges with the likes of International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and Microsoft, and forged partnerships with the likes of Cisco and Deloitte, Apple is in the midst of making its most aggressive push into the enterprise ecosystem. These partnerships take care of the software side of things, but the conundrum remains with the hardware. There is a definite potential of cannibalization within the computing device line-up, with the MacBook Airs, iPad Pros and MacBook Pros fighting for a common demographic, for the most part. Apple will also have to contend with some amount of criticism in 2017, with the underwhelming upgrades to the MacBook Pro line-upthis at a time when Microsoft flexed its muscles with the Surface Studio. Nevertheless, the iPhone remains as solid as ever for enterprise users.Microsofts Surface gambit: Revive the PC market?At a time when personal computer, or PC, shipments have been steadily declining, Microsoft seems to have taken it upon itself to set the benchmark in the ecosystem. And in the process, also show off what it is capable of. The Surface Studio all-in-one (AIO) with the Pixel Dial joins the Surface Pro and Surface Book portable Windows convertibles, and is indeed revolutionary. The 28-inch PixelSense display is believed to be the slimmest of its kind, and has 63% more pixels than a 4K TV. With prices starting $2,999 (Rs2,00,000 approximately), it isnt going to fly off the shelves. Though arguably, the first time ever, Microsoft has started to beat Apple at the innovation and design games, but just how they follow it up in 2017 will matter a lot. Flexing of the muscles aside, the real utility will now need to stand outand that holds true for the entire laptop and convertible market.Big data: Itll be biggerWhile there is considerable focus on smart cities, public transport and smarter infrastructure, there remains an ever-increasing need for data to make these systems work. For example, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Ford Motor Co. are collecting the cellphone location data of as many as two million Boston city residents; the idea is to create near-instant urban mobility patterns which would otherwise have taken years to collect, decipher and work on. Big data will be ever so critical for corporations, governments and also for research, and this is what will drive productivity, innovation and collaboration.Googles Pixel hardware game: A new inningsWith the Pixel phones, there has been a constant emphasis on the Made by Google aspect. It is clear that the software and services major wants to get into the hardware game, on its own terms. And so it has, wielding greater control over the successors to the Nexus smartphones. Finally, Android as a platform is shining throughunhindered, unwrapped and uncluttered. Pixel has shown just how good Android can be, but Google needs to fix bigger problemsthe world is still buying Android phones made by the likes of Samsung, Motorola and a whole bunch of Chinese brands, and they have no control over thatcustomization, lack of software updates and more. Do we see an even bigger Pixel smartphone line-up, covering more affordable price points?Security: Artificial Intelligence (AI) to prevent cyber-attacks?In todays world, cybersecurity is managed by a combination of humans and machines, with the latter usually configured by the former, and there remains genuine room for error. This is where the researchers from the MIT, perhaps, have a solution for the futurea new system called AI2. It uses machine learning to flag potential security threats and attacks. The human element remains, but the new system can actually scan and flag a lot more data than any human can.Dells ultimate ultrabook becomes flexibleThe Dell XPS 13 is perhaps the best ultrabook in the Windows laptop ecosystem.

0.44,"The post-demonetization narrative that initially saw banks as the biggest beneficiaries of a deposit delugea massive Rs12.4 trillion at last counthas now morphed into a more balanced one now.
				   
				Deposits are a cost until you get the money off your back through lending and that is not happening. Business was hard to come by in 2016 for bankers and 2017 is going to be even harder. Companies have stopped borrowing and the few who did, borrowed from the bond market. Bankers themselves are preoccupied with fixing bad loans rather than going after new customers. As a consequence, the loan book expanded at an unflattering single-digit pace. But the currency withdrawal worsened it to 5.76% as of 9 December, a glacial pace not seen in more than half a century.So, banks have now opted to go all out to stoke the dying embers of credit offtake by cutting lending rates. And the cuts are not the typical piecemeal affair, but a deep slash unseen in many years. State Bank of India dropped its benchmark lending rate by a massive 90 basis points and others such as Dena Bank, Union Bank of India and Punjab National Bank have followed suit. Eventually, everyone else will begin cutting rates too.Bankers and analysts seem to think that this will light a fire under the bank loan book. Firstly, many bankers are betting on pent-up demand and expect retail loan growth to gallop once the dust settles on demonetization. This is quite possible as most individuals would have postponed their discretionary spending to a future date. Two weeks into demonetization, retail loan growth slowed to 15.2% from 18% a year ago, data on credit as of 25 November from the Reserve Bank of India showed.Secondly, pockets like affordable housing will do well because currency withdrawal has dampened real estate prices to some extent and the government aims to boost rural housing under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. Indeed, home loans in the priority sector grew by 6.6% in November, a bit faster than 6.1% a year ago and this is a credible sign of the affordable space performing better.In all this, the cost to banks will be an erosion of margins but this will be minimal. Banks have already cut deposit rates deeply and the loan rate cuts announced since Friday were expected. Also, analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd point out that under marginal cost-based lending rate, banks can choose interest rate reset dates and in retail loans, these are elongated. This means that transmission will take time.Which is why investors may soon return to bank stocks despite the shares taking a beating on Monday.",2017-01-03,cFqxiOG42uSxFrAfjuxh2I,"And the cuts are not the typical piecemeal affair, but a deep slash unseen in years",competitor,07:52,Are lending rate cuts a desperate attempt to stoke the dying embers of credit offtake?
-0.67,"The next big challenge for Indian law firms will be how to make the best use of technology and how to motivate their human resources, Cyril Shroff, managing partner of Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, said in an interview as he looks back at the history of a firm that is 100 years old. Indias largest law firm, Amarchand and Mangaldas and Suresh A. Shroff  and Co.s Delhi and Mumbai regions, managed by brothers Shardul and Cyril Shroff, respectively, agreed to split into two firms in 2015.  Edited excerpts:
Amarchand Mangaldas has completed 100 years. How has it progressed institutionally and what is the way forward?It is an inflexion point in our journey. It gives us the moral authority and stature, as an organization, to reflect on the past and chart the future. It has been a truly rich and long history that started around 100 years ago. Along the way it has morphed a number of times during the journey to adjust to the changing times. If we just look back at the eras the firm has lived through starting from the great depression, the world war, Indias freedom struggle, independence, writing of the Constitution, formation of the Supreme Court, Nehrus economic policy, so many different prime ministers, so many changes in capital markets and corporate law, the firm has so much experience behind it. If you have stayed around for so long and stayed relevant there is something right you are doing and it is all due to our core values.You need to be nimble and open to change; for instance, none of the people are the same, none of the clients are the same. We have always changed any adversity into opportunity. So in a sense for us it has been series of new beginnings. Accepting changes is the DNA of Amarchand. Anyone who is not nimble enough to accept changes wont survive and that is true for every business, not just law firms.The legal sphere has changed in every era, particularly in the past 20-25 years. This is an era where the idea of a modern law firm really took birth. And it was the Amarchand legacy which invented modern firmsmodern structure, campus recruitment, smart offices. Where do you think the next wave of changes will come for Indian law firms?Technology will be a big part of the change. Even today we are about 625 lawyers. Such a workforce requires a lot of management in terms of your resources, technology deployment and outreach to clients. The next big challenge would be how to make best use of technology and how to motivate human resources.In terms of the digital age and technology firms,  enforcement of contracts and (intellectual property) rights is a virgin area. A lot of conversation is on privacy and rights. Part of our business plan is to look at the most relevant new industries and almost all of them are based in technology. This is a new practice area and may become huge in coming years. For instance, the issue is around taxation, competition law, human rightsthese are the issues for these new-age businesses. It is fascinating. We are on the verge of a fourth industrial revolution and the old-world offerings and laws are a mismatch with new challenges and opportunities presenting themselves in this digital system.Our clients are changing all the time due to the churn in the corporate sector and so are the practice areas. For instance, the new bankruptcy codewe are tailoring our practice accordingly. What is needed is a pragmatic interpretation of the business scenario and adaptation to achieve policy goals. Overhauling of old regulations is too disruptive.Like Indian companies, Indian law firms are largely family operated. Do you see some changes happening there?This is a historical fact; better to say that there are founders who are still in control of firms. But, equally they have come a long way in sharing power. Its the pace of change that is a little uncertain. It would be incorrect to say that they are only founder-owned. Firms have a strong founder influence but they also have a lot of professionals who have a say in running the firm, including ours.What are your views on entry of foreign firms? Will it lead to consolidation?I think entry of foreign firms should be allowed as soon as possible so long it is done properly by keeping all stakeholders on board. This has been a lingering idea for so long and keeping this in a limbo for so long is not a good idea. At some stage it has to happen. It will enable the market to move to the next level in terms of sophistication, economics because currently fee levels are in a free fall; there is hyper competition, fees are going down, costs are going up, particularly for talent. There is need for a trigger to resolve the current situation and I think entry of foreign firms is going to be that trigger. Indian firms merging with foreign firms may not happen. India has not seen too many law firm mergers. There may be team acquisitions but big firm mergers may not happen.Recent corporate battles such as the Tata-Mistry spat have raised concerns about family control, corporate governance. What are your larger views on these issues?I do not comment on specific cases. But more generally, if we look at the corporate governance scenario and debate in India, we are dealing with a version 2.0. There is far more awareness about conflicts, what are the roles of different stakeholdersminority shareholders, independent directors, responsibility of promoters, institutional investors, proxy advisers. Everyone is taking their roles much more seriously and we have moved by leaps and bounds. Our firm has a separate division that is a corporate governance advisory, which is advising companies on governance issues. Most of the companies are facing issues such as managing conflicts such as related party transactions, succession, role of founders and promoters. India is the only country which has a concept of promoters. What is a promoteris it just a label, liability, does it give you extra power, all of this is being discovered on a case-by-case basis.There is this whole issue of promoters getting extra information that other investors dont. How does one resolve this?Promoters carry a lot of burden. Because they carry extra burden and are in control of the company, I see a rationale in them getting privileged information. What is ambiguous is that what is the boundary surrounding thatso that is evolving. The foundation of higher governance standards was laid with the Companies Act, 2013, and then Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India) amending the listing and disclosure requirements. But nothing happens with just regulations now, the laws are being tested with real-life examples.There is no regulator for law firms, does the Bar Council need changes? India has always operated under the idea that practising law is a privilege and this is a noble profession. So there are, for instance, restrictions on advertising. Unfortunately, globally practising law has become a business. Overseas regulations have evolved in terms of how you regulate a service and a businessprovider of the service and consumer of the service. We are still dealing with the first concept and that is the reason for the disconnect. There is a lack of understanding on business model; the law profession, it has now morphed itself into a business and a service. We still believe it to be a noble profession but we are also a business, we have a profit and loss account, we have to pay salaries. That is why the regulations have not kept pace with changing dynamics.But the flip side is that laws keep on changing and even flip-flopping.No matter how clearly the law is drafted, it will always need to be amended to suit newer dynamics. Its hard to cope with changes but actually we are happy that law is not static and it is evolving. Sebi does a good job of it and considers all the views, and that is the reason why the regulations come out looking much better.What is your view on Indian tax policies? We have acquired a bad name due to flip-flops on the issue. I wont deny the fact that India has a bad reputation in terms of stability in tax regime for a variety of reasons. But if you look at the direction and the political intent being displayed by the government, it is towards political stability. It is intended to create ease of business. If you compare it with the period two-three years back, it has got a lot better. What I worry about the current economic thinking is that it has started moving or slanting towards the left. What started off as a more right-oriented policy has now shifted to the left. One of the things that I see happening is inheritance tax. This may happen in the current regime. It comes from the mindset that 1% of the population is controlling 60% of Indias wealth. The broader theme is to move to a more stable tax regime. There are some aberrations such as the recent circular on FPIs (foreign portfolio investors). But the broader picture is to create a stable environment. I believe the government on that.What are your observations on the merger and acquisition (M&A) climate in India?I think the merger and acquisition climate is decent just now but a lot of underpinning of the market on the sell side is stressed asset pressure and for buy side or foreign investors, India continues to be a bright spot and an opportunity. Barring a few, most deals are local. In terms of deal execution, Indian acquirers are more flexible and can take much more risks than global acquirers. Global players take time in due diligence and paper work. And due to so much pressure of stressed assets, the sellers do not have patience to wait for global buyers or investors.Deals being closed in the stressed asset area are quite small, right?My take on this is that in the next couple of years, these stressed asset deals would be concluded bilaterally and not under bankruptcy code. Lets take the Jaypee, UltraTech, Rosneft deal, for example. The motivation was to sell stressed assets but it was completely done bilaterally and in a complete conventional M&A fashion. If it had to take place under, say, a bankruptcy code or a CDR (corporate debt restructuring) case, then it would not have ever happened. So from the sell side it is going to be a resolution of stressed asset situation and implementation would be bilateral. I think this trend is going to continue, till such time the new bankruptcy code and things surrounding it are completely settled. Assets that have lost all value would go down effectively as a garage sale through the bankruptcy code and assets with some good equity would continue to be sold bilaterally.",2017-01-27,cMTnz9x0Vfe9UIjOlFGGUK,"The managing partner of Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas on the next big challenge for law firms, the emergence of issues such as enforcement of contracts in a digital age and privacy rights",competitor,23:54,Accepting changes is the DNA of Amarchand: Cyril Shroff
-0.04,"In a past column, I touched upon what has come to be known as the digital divide between the haves and the have-nots and suggested that it may be time for a supra-national body similar to the World Health Organization to be constituted to help govern the world of technology. My argument is that, to some degree at least, technology is a public good, just as basic health is, and its benefits need to be shared across a larger swathe of the worlds population.In a scathing article in the Financial Times last week, Chandran Nair, founder of the Global Institute for Tomorrow, argues that the technology giants of today such as Microsoft completely ignore the fact that the majority of the worlds populationespecially those in developing countriesare still stuck in a pre-industrial age, and that technology as the developed world knows itsearch engines, e-commerce, artificial intelligence, virtual reality and so onare of no use to people who have to still practise pre-industrial techniques such as slash-and-burn farming in order to survive. I must have been reading his thoughts.He talks of the yearly haze that blankets countries such as Singapore and Malaysia when farmers in Indonesia burn their oil palm crop every year so that they can plant anewwhile developers and IT executives sit in air-conditioned rooms and hold conferences about the future of technology, blissfully unaware of pre-industrial age social problems, such as where to find a toilet. He claims that when a question about this deep digital divide was posed to Microsoft, the spokespersons answer was: This is a question for a futurist to ponder, and not one for technologists to worry about.The lopsided distribution of technology benefits is a known fact, but regulators are flummoxed with how to deal with the problem. Regulationor governmental activismto date has been focused only on three vectors. First, the attempt to break monopolistic market power held by a few corporations. Second, an attempt to mop up a larger share of the tax pie when such companies experience enormous profits. And, third, a clumsy attempt to protect privacy by forcing data on customers to stay in the country where it was first generated.At the beginning of this century, Microsoft was hit by US regulators who found that its Internet Explorer, which was bundled with Windows software, was an attempt to shut out other Internet browsers, and forced to pay a hefty fine for indulging in monopolistic practices. The European Union (EU) is now trying to force search engines to not use their market power to coerce content providers such as news organizations to provide their information for free on their search engine sites. YouTube has been banned in China, and Google simply shut down operations in Spain when the Spaniards tried to charge a levy on Google aggregating content from news organizations and then providing this news for free for users of its search engine or mobile operating systems.Tax legislation, sometimes even grand-fathered to defeat judgements handed down by an apex courtas happened in the famed Vodafone India tax caseis an example of a national government going to great lengths to use policy to widen its tax net, or the second vector.We now have WhatsApp using a change in its privacy policy to hand over its users information to Facebook, its parent, after first claiming that no one, not even WhatsApp, can see the content of the messages that its users send to one another. WhatsApp, of course, claims that this data is only going to be used for it to explore ways in which its users can interact with businesses that matter to them without being subjected to third-party banner ads and spam. Well, okay, but Daddy Facebook is even rumoured to have algorithms that can predict when two of its users are falling in love with one another.Most outsourcers in India are hampered by ham-handed EU privacy laws which mandate that personal data regarding European citizens needs to stay in Europe. Streamlined, supra-national legislation in this areagoverning the capture and use of personal data, and the nature of the myriad personal relationships that individuals have with one another onlinewill be necessary soon. The present clumsy laws need to change.Regulation has not yet addressed the fourth vectorthe use of technology for the common good. In one of my recent discussions with Kashyap Kompella, a researcher at The Real Story Group, he spoke of the need for an Indian Technology Service to be included among Indias civil service agencies. This, he argued, could support the formation of unified policies for bringing technological benefits to the poor, as well as making sure that data privacy issues are managed with no negative impact on the citizenry.My take is that while such national, governmental bodies are necessary so that each country can form its own technology policies, there are certain aspects of the rapid advance of technology that can only be governed and managed through supra-national bodies that ensure a modicum of egalitarian distribution of the positive aspects of technology (i.e. technologys characteristics as a public good) and the negative aspects (data piracy, identity theft and other such public dangers posed by cyber criminals) are policed and kept to a minimum. In all seriousness, I would vote that China be the first president of this body.Siddharth Pai is a management and technology consultant.",2016-08-30,cMteXq54s65H6QzfVvn49N,"The lopsided distribution of technology benefits is a known fact, but regulators are flummoxed with how to deal with the problem

For perspective: advertising revenue, accounting for 56% of the total revenue, grew 29% compared with the past year. Ad revenue is expected to grow at 22.2% yoy (year-on-year) on a base of 15% yoy, Edelweiss Securities Ltd had said in its March quarter preview. A combination of premium content/properties during the quarter and overall viewership share increases helped the companys ad revenue growth beat expectations. The launch of Hindi general entertainment channel &tv did help advertising growth in FY16, says Mihir Modi, chief finance and strategy officer at Zee Entertainment.
				   
				On the other hand, subscription revenue, accounting for 39% of total revenue, increased at a relatively slower pace of 16.4%. Zee Entertainment derived its remaining revenue from other sales and services, the share of which dropped to about 5% compared with 12.4% in past years quarter. Overall revenue increased by about 14% to Rs.1,532 crore. Still, a decline in advertising and publicity expenses, and other expenses boosted operating profit performance.Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) increased as much as 53% year-on-year to Rs.414 crore.  Kotak Institutional Equities and Edelweiss Securities were expecting an Ebitda of Rs.372.7 crore and Rs.366.8 crore, respectively. Nevertheless, a higher tax outgo and rising depreciation costs together with a decline in other income meant net profit growth was much slower at 13% to Rs.260 crore.What next? What will really be worth watching is whether ad revenue growth performance is sustainable in fiscal year 2017. That should influence the stock, which has outperformed the benchmark Sensex in the past one year. Zee Entertainment expects industry advertising revenue to grow by 15-16% this year, a rate similar to last year. While it is true that the likes of Patanjali are adding to advertising momentum from FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) sector, some others in the FMCG space have slowed down; so, we expect stable performance from FMCG sector this year, says Modi. Also, its worth noting that advertising momentum from e-commerce firms is likely to soften, which would be compensated by better performance from auto and telecom sectors, he adds.Nevertheless, valuations seem to be capturing much of the optimism.

Ltd pointed out in a report on ONGC recently that crude oil prices are likely to head towards $60 a barrel over the next 12-18 months, led by ongoing capex (capital expenditure) and production cuts across the E&P (exploration and production) industry, a potential supply freeze by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries over the next 12 months, likely narrowing of excess supplies and stabilization of prices from the latter half of the current fiscal year.Needless to say, higher oil prices are key for investor sentiment to revive in these stocks. The recently announced June quarter results of these companies reflect the impact of lower crude oil prices. Net price realizations of both companies declined year-on-year. ONGC and OILs net realizations declined 22% and 25% to $46.1 a barrel and $43.09 a barrel, respectively. But that was on expected lines. The measure was higher sequentially, helped by a recovery in broader crude oil prices after touching lows earlier in 2016.As expected, the drop in realization led to a drop in profits. ONGCs Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) declined 23% to Rs9,390 crore. This excludes exploration costs that were written off. Again, ONGCs Ebitda was above some analysts estimates owing to lower-than-expected other expenses. OILs Ebitda declined 29% to Rs863 crore.On the flip side, production performance is far from encouraging. ONGCs crude oil production declined 2% year-on-year and was flat compared to the March quarter. OILs crude oil production declined 4.6% over last years June quarter but was 2.8% higher than the March quarter. To be sure, ONGC subsidiary ONGC Videsh Ltds (OVLs) production increased 12% year-on-year but that includes volumes from its stake purchase in Vankor (JSC Vankorneft), Russia. Of course, higher production from Vankor should help to some extent. For fiscal year 2016, OVL reported a net loss of Rs2,094 crore against a net profit of Rs1,904 crore in FY15, as low crude oil prices caused tremendous grief.ONGC and OIL both currently trade at about 12 times their estimated earnings for this fiscal year. Even as valuations appear undemanding, as mentioned earlier, higher oil prices are essential for improving sentiments for both stocks.

-1.0,"Mohamed Ismail Jamal, 41, got the idea for watscooking.com, while eating biryani with his family, to give the large number of homesick, immigrant professionals of Bengaluru a taste of home. With more than 5,000 registered home chefs across over 100 cities on his portal, Jamal explains what they do and what happens next. Edited excerpts:
Why did you see a need for a website like this?I was eating chicken biryani with my family in a reputed restaurant and realized that my wife made a much better version. So, I asked her how much would it cost to make a similar portion at home. She said around Rs70-80. The restaurant, however, had charged us Rs240. While it made sensewhen you factor in the ambience, service and taxesI also began to wonder about people who simply wanted a good plate of biryani and couldnt cook it themselves.This got me thinking about people who were away from home due to work or education and did not have the time or inclination to cook. There are home-makers all over the country who are excellent cooks and there are people craving for good home-cooked food, so it would make sense to connect them on a web platform. This way, homemakers could make money by cooking an extra portion while starving people could get a good home-cooked meal. India has a number of homemakers whose skills are largely underutilized and we saw this as a great opportunity to empower and create micro-entrepreneurs. That was the rationale behind watscooking.How does it work? What are the current offerings?Any aspiring individual who cooks well can get on watscooking and list the dishes they can offer in a matter of 10 minutes. They can offer home-cooked food, home-made chocolates, cakes, sweets or food products like masala powders, pickles, etc. The sellers have the option to deliver food themselves or get it picked up. Users can identify the people offering food and products within their neighbourhood either using the website or our mobile app and make a request to connect with the seller. They can then communicate with each other and close the transaction.What was your initial investment? Do you plan to seek funding?When we started, we just wanted to enable homemakers to earn from their homes. Surprisingly, a large number of people began to show interest, both sellers and buyers, in a short span of time. So, we realized the need for a more comprehensive platform, a mobile app, customer service, etc., and invested more than $40,000 to get to where we are now.We started yearly membership subscriptions, from as low as Rs599 per year for sellers on the platform a month ago and got more than 100 paid sellers. With more than 100 million potential home-based sellers, this business model is highly lucrative and the market is global. Now, we plan to seek funding to strengthen technology and marketing.Can you give me a sense of scale? How many home chefs do you have registered? How many cities?We currently have around 5,000 registered home chefs across 100-plus cities and around five countries (US, UK, UAE, Singapore and Malaysia). We have the most number of sellers in tier-I and tier-II cities of India, with 1,200 in Chennai, 900 in Bengaluru, 600-plus in Mumbai, Delhi and the rest in other cities. We also have 20,000 registered users already. Every day, we receive more than 50 new registrationssellers and users. We hope to get around 100,000 registered home chefs in the next two years.What are your biggest challenges?The biggest challenge is the unstructured nature of the business. The sellers in the platform may have other priorities, such as taking care of their children. Hence, we introduced many flexible features on the platformfor instance, they can make their profile offline if they are travelling. Also, for the users, we emphasize on networking and social aspects rather than seeing the home chefs as commercial sellers. The core concept of the platform is to enable a sharing economy based on peer-to-peer trust rather than a buyer/seller marketplace.A home chefs reputation is built on user reviews and ratings. The best rated home chef tops the list and it drives the quality. In addition, we have our customer support team monitoring their contents and transactions, regulating the quality.What are the benefits of this for stay-at-home mothers/homemakers?Watscooking enables them to earn extra money, get a sense of identity, lots of confidence and independence.Where is this most successful and why? Do you see any trend among the people who opt for this?The growth is phenomenal in metros like Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru and Chennai, due to working couples, migrants and students living away from home.What are your next plans?We plan to introduce our next version of the mobile app, introduce festive portals for people to sell homemade sweets on occasions like Ganesh Chaturthi and Diwali. We hope to expand to more cities and reach out to more homemakers.",2016-11-09,cZbMFc1JIgQMbzGMElpXhP,"More than 5,000 home chefs have signed up for Mohamed Ismail Jamals watscooking.com",competitor,02:55,We saw this as a great opportunity to create micro-entrepreneurs: Watscooking founder
-0.72,"Bengaluru: Flipkart chief financial officer Sanjay Baweja resigned this month, barely two years after he joined the online marketplace. Baweja, 56, is a veteran CFO, having held senior roles at Tata Communications Ltd, Emaar MGF and Bharti Airtel Ltd. He was hired to set up badly needed processes and systems, cut losses and prepare Flipkart for an eventual IPO. In an interview, Baweja spoke about why he left Flipkart ahead of plan, his achievements and dismissed allegations of fraud against him. Edited excerpts:
Why leave now?In the past two years, weve been able to expand the market in a big way. Weve been able to bring a lot of new customers into the fold, bringing more cities into play, bringing more pin codes into play. Thats happened because weve been focused on innovation; weve launched new stuff like product exchange, no-cost EMI. Weve built a very strong leadership team, especially in finance. From the time Ive come till now, the processes weve put in place, the standards of governanceits been a remarkable journey. We have the audit on a quarterly basis; the accounting closes on day 4-5 (of a given month); were on our way to SOX compliance (requirement under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the US). So, all of this allowed me to think that now that the company is in strong hands, I can move on to something fresh, something else I wanted to do.Where are you going after Flipkart?Im not at liberty to disclose that as of now.Much of the senior management that oversaw Flipkarts disastrous performance in the year ended March 2016 have been removed or have left. Does your exit have anything to do with this?No, my exit is about what I wanted rather than the other way round.How well prepared is Flipkart for an IPO? Any visibility on when an IPO will happen?Now that I have left Flipkart I cant talk about the timing. But as far as preparedness is concerned, we have transitioned. We are on our SOX compliance road map; we are meeting international standards. Like I said, we are doing quarterly audits, we close our books on a monthly basis on day 5 (of the next month). So, from the structure perspective, which Im used to delivering, were well on our way to being prepared. Now, the preparedness also has to come from a business perspective. Thats where the company will still take some time before it goes on the IPO journey.An anonymous Twitter handle has accused you of fraud and said that your exit was because of this alleged fraud. According to the Twitter handle Unicon Baba, Flipkart, at your behest, paid Tata Communications 30% more than it was paying its previous data centre supplier. Comment?Ive read it and its an absolute load of crap. We have robust processes. When we do an RFP (request for proposal) we invite people to bid for it. In this case, they (Tata Communications) were the only ones who could have delivered. When Chennai went down (during last years floods), our data centre was up and running. We went for the servers that were technically the most superior and lowest cost. I dont know where this 30% is coming from. Theres no inquiry. Nothing of this kind has come up.In the past two years, some senior leaders from established companies  who came to Indian Internet firms havent fit in and have had bitter experiences. Do you regret joining Flipkart?Not at all. Ive enjoyed every bit of the last two years. I enjoyed putting in the frameworks, the processes, the feeling of growing the company. When I was at TCL (Tata Communications Ltd), I had a great time. And then I took the call to come here. So, you take calls at some points in your career. I think Flipkart will go places and I will benefit eventually.ALSO READ | Flipkart CFO Sanjay Baweja resigns, replacement unclear",2016-10-27,cg7uvQRScEay19U9nF8X7O,"Outgoing CFO Sanjay Baweja on why he left Flipkart ahead of plan, his achievements and allegations of fraud against him",competitor,04:00,Flipkart is in strong hands now: Outgoing CFO Sanjay Baweja
-0.4,"In an interview on the sidelines of Dell World 2016 in Austin, Texas, on 19 October, Michael Dell, chairman and chief executive of the worlds largest privately-controlled technology company, Dell Technologies, shared his views on the prospects for the combined Dell-EMC. Edited excerpts:
In a world of smartphones, you remain committed to a PC-centric world. Why? We listen to customers. I did not say that smartphones are not important. I believe its a multi-device world. In 2012, the idea was smartphones here and PCs thereits not correct now. In organizations, smartphones and PCs coexist in a multi-device world. The view around that time (that the) PC was dead created an opportunity for us. Many customers are not giving up on PCs. Liken this to transportation, where people use different modes like bicycles, cars, trains and planes. Computing is like that too with tablets, smartphones, PCs, etc. PCs offer another way of computing.But PCs, servers, storage, etc. are commoditized businesses... ...in the PC segment, we have gained share for 15 quarters in a row. We are doing very well, we are growing. When a commercial client chooses Dell PCs, it chooses us for the services and support and also Intel and AMD (Advanced Micro Devices Inc.) and Microsoft. Its another way of saying these are our suppliers that have a higher share. Therefore, we should be more concerned about our suppliers if margin erosion is a concern. ALSO READ | Will Dell make it big with EMC?One of the reasons for our success is because we have brought tremendous value for our customers, democratized technology by making it more available and more affordable. There is no shortage of competitors in the business we are in. We need to provide high levels of service, continue to innovate, build great relationships and customers will reward us.How are you tackling issues around cultural challenges in the merged Dell-EMC entity? We had a decade-and-a-half lead-up to the combination. And it goes back to 2001 when we had announced an alliance called Dell EMC. The apparent intent was that Dell was going to sell EMC storage technologies to its customers. We did billions of dollars of sales. Under the cover, Dell server technology was embedded into pretty much every storage product line that existed and EMC became our largest OEM (original equipment manufacturer) customer in the world. And so our teams, beginning 2001, learnt how to work together in terms of supply chain, R&D, sales and importantly culturewe became friends.The businesses dont have a lot of overlap. In 2009, we had a fairly in-depth look at whether we should combine the companiesreams of analyses, we had consultants from both companies, we had directors from the boards of both the public companies meeting secretly in places, and we were negotiating combining both the companies. However, because of the financial crisis at that time, we decided not to do so.Then, in 2013, we took the company private. Everyone thought the PC was dead. So, we bought the company back. Thank you very much. And in 2014, I called my friend Joe Tucci (Joseph Tucci is the former chairman, president and chief executive officer of EMC) and said, Why dont we re-examine what we looked at five years earlier, refresh all the analyses and see if it makes sense now? So, that was more than two years ago, which resulted in our October 2015 result.I got some great advice. I talked to a number of executives who had gone through a number of combinations like thesesome had succeeded; some had failed. One of the things that a number of them said: You should as early you can, communicate the strategy of the new company and its structure. They also said, with all due respect to the current CEO of EMC, you should act as if you were leading the new company from the day of the announcement of the planned merger, not the closure date. Legally, you are not supposed to do that. And I didnt break any laws.ALSO READ | Dell Technologiess road map for IndiaI was very present within EMC from the day of the announcementat the leadership meetings, meeting the whole team, learning about the teams, and as we come together as one family and the cultures are a lot more similar than different.Whats the strategy you are employing to handle a smooth integration? We communicated the hierarchies within the organization to our teams. Not everyone has got exactly the job they want. Given the all-star teams we have in the combined Dell-EMC group, we effectively have an Olympic team. You must always start with the strategy. If you do it by personality or anything else, it will be a totally wrong way to do it. From the strategy, you must define the structure to achieve the strategy. You lay out the strategy. Then find out who are the people from within, or outside, the organization for each role to accomplish the strategy.For each role, you have several candidates. So you find the jobare you excited about the job, are you passionate.

-0.48,"Maersk Line, the worlds biggest container shipowner, is steering the debate on responsible ship recycling to a different course by announcing last week its commitment to help selected ship recycling yards in Alang upgrade facilities and practices to comply with the companys standards.
				   
				The announcement by the poster boy of container shipping to use its leverage to create more responsible ship recycling options is music to the ears of ship breakers along a 10-km stretch of beach at Alang in Gujarat states Bhavnagar district. The work practices followed on the beaches of Alangthe worlds largest stretch of ship breaking beacheshave often been vilified for its negative human rights impacts and environmental degradation, including child labour, frequent fatalities, inadequate working and living conditions, lack of access to hospitals and proper waste facilities.Out of the 768 ships recycled globally in 2015, 469representing 74% of the total gross tonnage (capacity) scrappedwere sold to facilities on beaches in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.Critics of Maersk such as non-governmental organization Shipbreaking Platform have dubbed the companys decision to recycle its end-of-life ships in Alang as rubberstamping practices that they previously denounced to boost profits in times of low freight rates.Since 2009, Maersk Group, which owns Maersk Line, has been pursuing a policy of recycling ships responsibly. Responsible recycling, however, is only feasible in a limited number of yards in China and Turkey. Besides, on average, using one of these yards has an added cost of $1-2 million per recycled vessel, says Annette Stube, head of sustainability at Maersk Group.The number of vessels up for recycling by Maersk Group has been limited for the past decade; but in the next five years, a larger number of ships owned by the group will reach the end of their life. Using only responsible recycling facilities is estimated to incur extra costs of more than $150 million, compared with using upgraded facilities in India, according to Stube.With more vessels to recycle, the current cost of sustainable ship recycling is not feasible for Maersk as it looks to shore up its profitability. It is clear that with an ageing fleet, Maersk needs more options to recycle ships cost-efficiently and responsibly. Regulatory developments are further putting pressure on the industry to push for global availability of responsible practices.Responsible and sustainable ship recycling was intensely debated by the global shipping industry for many years, culminating in the adoption of the Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in 2009.Four year later, in 2013, the European Union published its own regulation on ship recycling.While the IMOs Hong Kong convention does not prohibit dismantling of redundant ships by the beaching method practised in Alang, the EU regulations have banned this practice.Under the beaching method, ships are first grounded and then broken in an unprotected marine environment. Critics say this method is polluting and unsafe for workers.The Hong Kong convention is yet to come into force because it has not been ratified by at least 15 states, representing 40% of world merchant shipping by gross tonnage (capacity), to take effect globally.The requirements of the EU ship recycling regulation will be phased in between now and December 2020.A key aspect of the EU regime is the development of a list of ship recycling facilities that are compliant with its standards. Once this is compiled by December this year, ships flying the flag of an EU member-state will only be sold for recycling to facilities that are included in the list.European fleet owners such as Maersk fear that the EU regulations would deprive them of adequate, responsible facilities, fetching lower prices while selling their old ships. Steady improvements in conditions have been witnessed in Alang over the last two years. Four of the 167 recycling facilities located there are now certified to the standards of the Hong Kong Convention.These four recycling facilitiesPriya Blue Industries Pvt. Ltd, RL Kalthia Ship Breaking Pvt. Ltd, Leela Ship Recycling Pvt. Ltd and Shree Ram Groupdo not comply with the EU regulations.Recyclers such as RL Kalthia say it will work towards compliance with the EU regulations by filling the gaps, if possible, within the method used for ship recycling in India (read beaching).Following a couple of visits to the four IMO-certified ship recycling facilities in 2015, the Maersk Group concluded that responsible recycling can be accelerated in the area.Maersks decision to look at Alang for its ship recycling needs is seen as an endorsement of the beaching method banned by the EU, without being irresponsible, by suitably upgrading facilities and practices that comply with the standards set by the company. The decision, though, could be a bit of an embarrassment for the EU, given Maersks European roots.And, Maersk is not hiding its views behind the niceties even while reiterating its policy to only recycle ships responsibly.The group says its goal is to make more responsible ship recycling facilities available, regardless of location and method applied by developing a standard that combines the Hong Kong convention and demands of the groups third-party code of conduct on anti-corruption, labour, human rights and sub-contractor matters. Maersk is, however, silent on the EU regulation in its pursuit of this goal.Maersk says it will not only work directly with the four IMO-compliant ship recyclers to upgrade their practices to comply with its standards, but also engage a broader coalition of shipowners to help upgrade a larger Alang area to get better waste facilities, hospitals and a general upgrade of all the facilities on the beach. The more shipowners that commit to engaging over this issue, the greater the leverage for change, says Stube. This could well be the road to redemption for Alang.P.

0.25,"The announcement of the imminent commercial launch of services by its telecom unitReliance Jio Infocomm Ltdat its annual general meeting has augured well for the Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) stock. Its share price has risen 7.5% from its recent low on 2 September. But its worth remembering that the stock has been an underperformer compared to the benchmark Sensex so far this year.
				   
				If you thought September quarter results would change sentiments dramatically, you are likely be disappointed. Stand-alone revenues have declined year-on-year but better operating profit margin, strong other income growth, and decline in finance and depreciation costs have helped the company report 20% growth in its pre-tax earnings. But that wont impress investors. Heres why: stand-alone Ebitda for September quarter came in at Rs10,555 crore. A poll of Bloomberg analysts was expecting the companys Ebitda at Rs10,569 crore. Thats pretty much in line. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.Unlike the June quarter when RILs gross refining margin (GRM) had surprised the Street positively, this quarter was fairly lukewarm. To be fair, GRM of $10.1 a barrel is not bad at all. The companys premium over Singapore GRM has dropped to $5 a barrel from as much as $6.5 a barrel. But investors are unlikely to punish the stock for that. For one, the companys GRM margin is slightly better than some brokerage firms estimates. Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd was expecting a GRM of $10 a barrel while analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd had forecasted a GRM between $9.5-10 a barrel.What really came as a big surprise this quarter is the performance of the petrochemicals business. According to the company, consolidated petrochemicals Ebit margin expanded to a 14-quarter high of 15.2% for the September quarter as product deltas held up well despite lower prices. Delta is the rate of change in prices compared with the change in unit costs. Strong volume growth also helped. Stand-alone petrochemicals Ebit increased to 16.3%, higher sequentially as well as on a year-on-year basis.As usual, the oil and gas business was a laggard, with Ebit declining as much as 83% year-on-year, adversely impacted by lower upstream production in domestic blocks along with lower prices. Sure, RILs organized retail business has done well but the segment is too small to make a big difference to overall numbers.On a consolidated basis, the companys debt service coverage ratio has declined to 0.88 from 2.79 in the June quarter. Is that a worry? According to independent analyst S.P. Tulsian, the decline in debt service coverage ratio should hardly be a concern for a company with RILs cash flows. Other analysts say the fall in the debt service ratio below 1 is just for one quarter and should not be extrapolated.What of the stock? Currently, RIL trades at 12.4 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year. Valuations arent exactly cheap considering that the refining environment is still sluggish. So far this quarter, benchmark Singapore GRM has averaged only marginally higher at $5.3 a barrel, says an analyst. RILs net debt has increased by about Rs10,000 crore sequentially to Rs1.06 trillion. Investors should watch out for that measure in the days to come.

-0.27,"London/Muscow: Opecs internal disagreements over how to implement supply cuts prevented a deal to secure the cooperation of other major suppliers after two days of talks in Vienna.
				   
				Nations including Russia and Kazakhstan ended talks at the headquarters of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) on Saturday without making any crude-supply commitments, said Brazils oil and gas secretary Marcio Felix.The producers will meet again for discussions on 25-26 November and the outcome of the process hinges on Iran and Iraq, said Azerbaijans energy minister Natiq Aliyev.A deal with other crude producers wasnt possible after internal Opec talks on Friday reached an impasse over the role of Iran and Iraq, both of which want to be exempt from any cuts. While non-member Oman said Saturday it was willing to cooperate in a supply deal, it couldnt commit to a specific output cut until Opec had its own agreement.Oil-producing nations need to continue dialog and come up with real numbers before cuts can begin, Kazakhstans Deputy Energy Minister Magzum Mirzagaliyev said after the meeting.Opecs surprise agreement in Algiers last month to make the first supply cuts in eight years will only make a serious dent in a record oil surplus if producers outside the group join in. While the accord helped push oil prices to a 15-month high above $50 a barrel earlier this month, they have subsequently fallen as several members disputed the production estimates that would determine the size of cuts. Failure to implement the output reduction agreed last month in Algiers will hurt oil producers, the organizations top official warned.Risk of failureOpec agreed on 28 September to reduce output to a range of 32.5 million to 33 million barrels a day, compared with about 33.4 million in September. None of the countries that attended Fridays meeting specified how much they are willing to cut, said one delegate, who asked not to be identified because the meeting was private. Still, progress was made on the methodology to be used for allocating individual production curbs, the delegate said.Anything short of implementation of this accord could lead to the elongation of the rebalancing process, with further deterioration of financial conditions and setbacks in investments extending into a third year, which would be unprecedented, Opec Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo said at the start of Saturdays meeting.This is a critical time for the oil market, which is still under great pressure because of a large stockpile surplus, Barkindo said, according to a transcript of his speech posted on Opecs website. The price recovery has already taken far too long and producers cant risk delaying it further, he said.Maximum commitmentWe should be calling for maximum commitment from all Opec and non-Opec countries to the Algiers accord, Barkindo said.Representatives of Azerbaijan, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Oman and Russia attended Saturdays meeting with officials from OPEC member states. Those countries collectively produced about 19.6 million barrels a day of oil last year, about 21 percent of global supply and equivalent to half of Opecs output, according to BP Plcs Statistical Review of World Energy.Oman is willing to cut production as part of deal with other producers, but is waiting for Opec to reach an internal agreement before deciding on the size of its own supply reduction, said Ali al Riyami, the nations representative at the meeting in Vienna. The Middle Eastern nation pumped about 1 million barrels a day in May.Rising productionRussia, the largest producer outside Opec, is already pumping at a post-Soviet record of about 11.1 million barrels a day. Prior to Saturdays meeting, energy minister Alexander Novak indicated the country would prefer to freeze at this level as part of any deal, rather than make a cut.Brazil attended the talks only as an observer, to listen to the other oil producers, Felix said before the meeting. The Latin American country will boost output by 290,000 barrels a day next year to 2.9 million a day, the biggest increase of any non-Opec nation, according to the International Energy Agency. Production will keep growing for the next few years, said Felix.Kazakhstan also plans to boost output next year following the restart this month of the $50 billion Kashagan oil field after 16 years of development. The field is currently pumping about 100,000 barrels day, which should rise to 200,000 by year-end and 370,000 by the end of 2017, Italian oil company Eni SpA said Friday. The nation isnt ready to join a freeze or cut, said Mirzagaliyev.

0.16,"Cement prices in northern India have reversed after staying down for long. Dealers say producers hiked prices suddenly by Rs.10-15/bag of 50 kg in February and another Rs.50-70/bag in early March. With average cement prices in February at Rs.267/bag, thats a substantial increase in March.
				   
				This does not appear to be an isolated instance but is not yet a widespread trend. The price increase in the north does appear to have spread to the nearby central region. But the western Indian market is subdued and in the southern parts, prices have retraced a bit after ruling strong for over a year. As for the eastern market, where prices are normally firm, it faced challenges.Binod Modi, an analyst at Reliance Securities, wrote in a report that cement prices in the north had slid to unviable levels since September, which was reflected in the weak December quarter performance. A bounce was waiting to happen. North-based companies are also following the price discipline displayed by their southern counterparts. Lower production has led to a tighter market. In addition, there has been a slow but sustained increase in demand due to government spending on infrastructure and low-cost housing.Meanwhile, dealers hope that higher budgetary support in fiscal year 2017 for infrastructure and housing will have a multiplier effect on cement demand. That may still not be enough to solve the problem of oversupply. Analysts at India Ratings and Research Pvt. Ltd said in a Webinar that cement capacity is likely to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.9% in the fiscal years between 2015 and 2017. They watered down demand growth in fiscal year 2016 from the earlier 6.5-8% to 3%.If profit margins are expected to remain stable even then, it is because of lower freight and energy costs.From an investors standpoint, the sector is more stable now than in the past two-three years.

-0.54,"At a time when companies are switching their business models to digital, cybersecurity has become a boardroom concern, for its implications now directly affect the balance sheet. However, its becoming increasingly difficult to objectively quantify a companys cyber risk considering the dynamic nature of an organizations perimeter, which in most cases cannot be distinctively defined thanks to BYOD (bring your own device), BYOA (bring your own access) and Dynamic DNS set-ups among others. The other component hindering quantification is the known unknown attack vectors. 
				   
				Reports estimate that the overall cost of cybercrime will touch $2 trillion (around Rs135 trillion) by 2019. Very recently in India, we saw 3.2 million debit cards being hacked; we have seen the largest bank in the worldJP Morgan Chasebeing hacked even though it spends $300 million on cybersecurity annually. We have seen companies headquartered in the Silicon Valley, built by the best tech minds from around the world, being hackedamong them Yahoo and Twitter. These examples clearly indicate that there is no such thing called 100% security. As in the physical world, the digital world also cannot be secured completely; it will be all about managing and mitigating risks.Cyberspace is continuously changing and evolving. In the future, companies will have to look at a three-dimensional approach of proactively protecting their digital stacks via technology and process-level controls, continuously monitor incidents and events and respond in the quickest and most efficient way possible in case there is an incident. Clear heat maps of data sets versus threat actors such as insiders, competitors, hacktivists, state-sponsored hackers, terrorists, script kiddies and organized criminals will be mapped specific to the industry and the company to prioritize security efforts. At the government level, recognizing the strategic dimensions of cyberspace, the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) created the position of  national cyber security coordinator in 2014, which is a great move. I feel Reserve Bank of India initiatives such as ReBIT (Reserve Bank Information Technology Pvt. Ltd) will enable the much required streamlining of financial services, IT and information security from a regulatory compliance standpoint. The recent push to have an independent payments regulator highlighted in the recent budget by the finance minister is another positive step in this direction.The future of hacking from a techies lens looks very, very exciting. We have already seen an explosion of on-demand hacking services like Haas (hacking as a service), and this will only expand in the future. From script kiddies to a bustling underground marketplace of tailor-made targeted DIY (do-it-yourself) exploits that have 24x7 support, along with the release of continuously enhanced and more sophisticated versions of a malwareits all now just a few clicks and a few hundred dollars away. With other hack enablers such as bot nets readily available to be purchased by the hour, the possibilities of a normal tech enthusiast executing a successful hack go up exponentially.With faster and cheaper computing power readily available, we will see the rise of more complex crypto algorithms with longer key values. This isnt all good news, for complex crypto is always a double-edged swordon the one hand, it does make it hard for a hacker to decipher the data both in motion and at rest; on the other, it becomes extremely difficult to decrypt system files affected by ransomware or doxware.We have been hearing about the shift from a signature-based analysis system to a behaviour and context-based system for quite some time now, but thanks to machine learning and artificial intelligence, I feel we will be able to take tangible steps towards this very soon. AI (artificial intelligence) and ML (machine learning) will also play an extremely important role in real-time learning about individuals from available data over the Internet to create a mind map (which will get more accurate as the data set increases) of an individual you might meet for the first timetaking the entire privacy debate to an absolutely new level. Not to forget the possible implication of an artificial intelligence attack on the Internetsomething thats only a matter of time, in the words of SpaceXs Elon Musk.There will be a clear shift to objective and quantized cyber risk management techniques that will incorporate the known unknowns to make cyber risk an informed business decision. The attack surface will not be restricted to internal IT but will extend to third parties, cloud providers and social media, among others. The focus in the future will not only be on security products but on building secure products from the ground up.The way we are adopting digital, with a clear push coming from the top in both private and public set-ups, technology is going to take centre stage in the success of most new initiatives. And while this happens, the key for the industry will be to learn from cyber attacks and embed the learnings into our defence systems as quickly as possible.

0.97,"Mumbai: A big infrastructure spending push, the boost to affordable housing and a fiscal deficit target of 3.2% of gross domestic product announced in the Union budget came as a big boost to banks. A tax concession on provisions for bad loans also came as a relief for Indian banks which are struggling with gross non-performing assets of around Rs6.7 trillion.
				   
				Banking stocks rallied more than the broader market with the BSE Bankex gaining 2.7%, a full percentage point more than the Sensex.In the budget speech, the finance minister outlined his proposals to create more jobs and boost infrastructure spending, measures which will help increase credit offtake for banks. Government spending on this sector will touch Rs3.96 trillion in the next fiscal. As banks have been struggling with a large number of stressed cases in the infrastructure segment, fresh investments will get the ball rolling and hopefully turn around some of those companies that have been defaulting.ALSO READ: Budget 2017: Jaitley gives infrastructure a massive pushOther measures that will boost credit growth include affordable housing projects being given infrastructure status and the highest target for farm credit at Rs10 trillion. After the governments move to withdraw Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes on 8 November, bank credit growth has fallen to around 5%, the lowest in a couple of decades. Another positive announcement for the banking sector was the governments comparatively tame net market borrowing figure of Rs3.48 trillion in 2017-18, as compared with Rs4.25 trillion in the current year. The net borrowing figure takes into account the securities that will be bought back, Jaitley said.Capital expenditure data provided in the budget document reveals that the gross market borrowing is set at Rs5.8 trillion for the new financial year, which is approximately the same as 2016-17. Jaitley also said the government proposes to increase allowable provision for non-performing asset (NPA) from 7.5% to 8.5%. This will reduce the tax liability of banks, he said. Allowable provision is the amount of bad loan provision that is tax deductible.ALSO READ: Budget 2017: Affordable housing to be given infrastructure statusCapital infusion of Rs10,000 crore for recapitalization of PSU Banks will be a morale booster in scenarios where Banks are in dire need of capital for Credit growth and Basel III compliance.

-0.02,"Dallas: Facebook Inc. chief executive Mark Zuckerberg took the witness stand in Dallas federal court on Tuesday and denied an allegation by a rival company that the virtual-reality technology of Facebooks Oculus unit was stolen.
				   
				Zuckerberg, the founder of one of the worlds largest companies, faced hours of tough, public questioning about where Oculus obtained its ideas and how much he knew about the start-up when Facebook bought it for $2 billion. A jury is hearing evidence in a civil lawsuit brought by videogame publisher ZeniMax Media Inc. against Oculus in 2014, in the middle of the Facebook-Oculus deal. ZeniMax said that Oculus unlawfully used its intellectual property to develop the virtual-reality system that includes the Rift headset.During one heated exchange with ZeniMax lawyer Tony Sammi, Zuckerberg told a jury in the crowded courtroom that the technology was not even fully formed when Facebook bought it. Improving on that technology doesnt make it yours, Sammi countered. If you steal my bike, paint it and put a bell on it, does that make it your bike?Zuckerberg, wearing a dark suit and striped tie rather than his typical T-shirt and jeans, answered, no, but then added: The idea that Oculus technology is based on someone elses is just wrong.The 32-year-old Facebook founder has spoken about virtual reality as an important part of the companys future business, especially as the technology becomes less expensive and its uses clearer. The Oculus acquisition was more expensive than the $2 billion price tag indicated, Zuckerberg said in court, describing $700 million spent to retain employees and $300 million in payouts for reaching milestones. Oculus originally wanted $4 billion, he said. Sammi questioned whether Facebook knew what it was doing when it made the acquisition. Zuckerberg said the Oculus deal was done over a weekend in 2014, which Sammi said did not show sufficient due diligence. Zuckerberg said, though, in later testimony that Facebook researched Oculus for months.At the time, Zuckerberg testified, he was not aware of any theft claims against Oculus. Its pretty common when you announce a big deal that people just come out of the woodwork and claim they own some part of the deal, Zuckerberg said. On the stand, he also gave details about Facebooks $22 billion purchase of messaging service WhatsApp in 2014. While the deal was in progress, another company he did not identify made a last-minute bid that was higher, Zuckerberg said, but WhatsApp declined because of its good relationship with Facebook.The Oculus lawsuit, in the sixth day of a jury trial, relates in part to programmer John Carmack. Well-known for helping to conceive games such as Quake and Doom, Carmack worked for id Software Llc before that company was acquired by ZeniMax. He is now the chief technology officer at Oculus. Zuckerberg denied that Carmack has unfairly used computer code from his previous position. There is no shared code in what we do, he said. Zuckerberg said he has been interested in virtual reality since he was a student, but thought it was decades away from happening before he encountered Oculus. He told jurors how he used virtual reality to capture his daughters first steps, so her grandparents could experience it later. We want to get closer to this kind of perfect representation, so you can capture a moment you had, he said.

-0.06,"A few days before Twitters 8 September board meeting, as the companys finance team readied a presentation, it received conflicting directions on a crucial question. Should their slides reflect Twitters prospects as an independent company or delve into the benefits of getting acquired?
				   
				Jack Dorsey, Twitters chief executive officer, argued that the 10-year-old company should remain on its current course and work to capitalize on recent product improvements and success in streaming live video, people familiar with the discussions said. Ev Williams, a former CEO who has a history of clashing with Dorsey, was in favour of exploring a sale. Other directors agreed they had a fiduciary duty to consider that option. The board ultimately decided to consider takeover prospects after getting an expression of interest from a potential acquirer, which led it to hire Goldman Sachs and Allen & Co. to evaluate possible bids.After pitching the San Francisco-based social network, the bankers received inquiries from suitors which so far include Disney and Salesforce, with Google also weighing a potential bid. This week, the board is consulting with other outside advisers on how to deal with the internal disagreement over a possible sale, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the process is private. Formal bids could come within a couple of weeksor not at all.Though its fate is in flux, one thing is clear: A year after he officially took back the reins as CEO, Jack Dorsey has either ceded or lost at least some control over the future of the company he helped create. On the board, he may be overruled by fellow directors on the future of Twitter as an independent company. Within his management team, hes largely delegated command of Twitters strategy to chief financial officer Anthony Noto. And among advertisers, Twitters fortunes are being constrained by its stagnant user numbers, which Dorseys product changes have failed to significantly boost, and by growing concern about harassment and abuse on its service.Also Read: Possible Disney merger with Twitter poses risks for Bob Iger legacyThe lack of growth in users and engagement underscore that Jacks initiatives thus far havent really been effective, said Robert Peck, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. If this whole live idea doesnt work, then what is it that gets Twitter to grow?Twitter spokeswoman Kristin Binns declined to comment on the boards discussions about a potential sale process. Asked to provide perspective on Dorseys progress, Binns said in an e-mail that the CEO has met the goals he outlined a year ago and made significant strides in each of his priorities for the company. The company has been rolling out products faster than ever, she noted, and has boosted engagement through enhancements to the timeline, such as showing people the most relevant tweets first. She also cited the companys advancements and partnerships in live video streaming, including deals to broadcast NFL games and presidential debates.As Twitters first CEO, Dorsey was initially known as a detail-obsessed micromanager. He was ousted in 2008, then brought back to Twitterwhich was having trouble attracting new usersto apply vision and direction with the kind of authority that only a founder can bring.But Dorsey hasnt seemed interested in being the sole authority on Twitters future, according to insiders. While he was away from Twitter, he built a credit-card reader company, Square Inc., and learned the importance of trusting others with strategic decisions. His leadership style in the past year at Twitter has been Socratic, not prescriptive, these people said. Hell ask open-ended questions to spark debate, like, Are we preventing people from expressing themselves fully with our 140-character tweet limit? What would a different solution look like?Also Read: Twitter bidders vying for data would inherit the doldrums tooThe discussions eventually lead to solutions, like Twitters move last month to exclude photos and attachments from a tweets character total. But the process takes time. And that passive, contemplative style created a void in management that Noto has stepped in to fill, people said.Noto has been just as responsible, just as influential at the company as Jack, said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. Hes been unusually active as a CFO.Earlier this year, Noto told Twitters other senior staff that he intended to bid for the rights to stream 10 Thursday night National Football League games. He wasnt expecting to win, but he wanted to try, according to people familiar with the conversations.Noto, who is a former CFO of the NFL, did winfor the bargain price of $10 million, lower than what others were willing to pay. That kicked off a string of other deals in sports, politics and entertainment, centered on making Twitter accessible to a wider audience through live video they can watch for free. The first NFL game drew 2.3 million users, and the next one got 2.4 million, hinting at the potential for a growing audience, according to the company.Its not that Dorsey has been uninvolved. On the contrary, his employees say he answers e-mails so quickly that its difficult to imagine how he has the time, given that hes also still CEO of Square. During his first month at Twitter, he cut 8% of the workforce. He recruited new board members like Debra Lee, the CEO of BET, and Hugh Johnston, the CFO of Pepsico, to add executive experience. Hes helped the strategy by providing a long-term perspective on the business and focused on a single concept to help drive it: live.But if Dorsey is the introverted deep thinker, Noto is the doer. Hes the high-energy cheerleader who has cut through indecision at the company and rallied Twitters employees around a future of live video streaming, boosted by licensing of premium content. (Twitter has partnered with Bloomberg LP to stream some Bloomberg TV shows, as well as the presidential debates.) Its unusual for a companys CFO to be leading its product vision, and even rarer at a technology company.Twitters engineers have long grappled with how to make the service easier to use, cycling through six heads of product in six years. Notos deal-making provided them with a unique solution: to make video an entry point to the Twitter experience. Twitter recently released streaming applications for Apple TV, Xbox and Amazon Fire TV, letting viewers pick content that streams alongside related tweets, and sidestepping the need for people to create an account and decide who to followpreviously a cumbersome prerequisite of using Twitter.Twitter hired Noto in 2014 with more than $60 million in stock options, following a career in banking at Goldman Sachs, where he helped Twitter go public. Its unclear whether Noto supports a Twitter sale. But he did recently retain Goldman to look at other options, like selling off assets besides the core business, according to people familiar. Notos presence at the company has long been a comfort to investors, with many figuring that if it came time to sell, he would know how to get it done.Even as the company gains ground in streaming, Dorsey is being forced to reconsider Twitters future in part because its lack of user growth. US average monthly users have hovered around 66 million for six quarters. Revenue, which more than doubled in 2014, is projected to rise just 15% this year, and to slow further next year.Advertisers see potential in the companys live video strategy, but theyre also being wooed by photo- and video-sharing app Snapchat, and Facebooks Instagram, which has recently become more advertiser-friendly. At the time of Twitters 2013 initial public offering, those services werent close competitors. Now they both have larger daily audiences than Twitter.Also Read: Twitter could take many forms, depending on new ownerTwitter budgets have slowly gone down and down and down, said James Douglas, who consults with advertisers on their spending as executive director of social media for Society, an agency within IPG Mediabrands whose clients include Coca-Cola and Red Bull. Its kind of hard to compel clients who had an experience with Twitter that wasnt good, or have the perception that Twitters audience is declining. Everyone has questions for them, Douglas said.Tom Buontempo, the president of Attention, the social arm of ad firm KBS, said hes seen the trend worsen in recent months. Its all a matter of where people are spending their time, he said. Im starting to hear more clients consider whether or not they need to be on Twitter at all. Attentions clients include BMW, Mattel and Lincoln Financial, though Buontempo wouldnt say who is pulling back.When Twitters CEO search committee was looking to replace Dick Costolo in 2015, they made calls to major investors, asking for input and floating Dorseys name as a contender. Some investors expressed their skepticism, given that Dorsey was already a large influence on Costolo, and could already impact the companys direction through his executive chairman role.Still, one year ago this week, Twitters board was jubilant on a conference call announcing the decision to bring back Dorsey permanently. Dorsey would help us achieve what we see as a massive opportunity to grow the company, Peter Currie, who helped lead the search and has since left the board, said at the time. The board has been pleased and impressed with the strategy, vision and alignment around goals coming from the Twitter teams these last few months, and there is much more the world hasnt seen just yet.Perhaps there is more to come. But some investors havent been willing to wait.Twitters stock had dropped about 20% this year before reports began to surface about the company considering a sale. Even one of its largest and earliest investors, Chris Sacca, a vocal critic of Twitters strategy under Costolo and proponent of bringing back Dorsey, has sold a large part of his stake, he told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday.Brad Slingerlend, who manages the global technology fund for Janus Capital Group, holds Facebook, Google, Amazon and Applebut sold Twitter after Dorsey took over. Social networking, he said, is a business that depends on a network effect to generate growth. If the networks momentum starts to ebb, its difficult to recover.The best-case scenario, Slingerlend said, would be an acquisition by Disney. As Twitter becomes more of a media company, the two make for a good fit, he said. And Disneys CEO, Bob Iger, has experience bringing a brand back to life.Jack is a good entrepreneur, Slingerlend said. But Twitter needs a turnaround CEO, and thats a completely different job. Bloomberg",2016-10-07,dpyqCrv7e3VSybEzZJ4glL,"A year after Jack Dorseys return as Twitter s CEO, live-streaming and new products havent revived growth",competitor,19:32,How Jack Dorsey is losing control of Twitter
0.79,"New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modis government is planning a Rs.21,000 crore package of state aid for Indias solar panel manufacturing industry, according to two officials.
				   
				The so-called Prayas initiative, short for Pradhan Mantri Yojana for Augmenting Solar Manufacturing, a central-government plan designed to lift Indias installed photovoltaic capacity as well as to create an export industry, according to two senior government officials with direct knowledge of the plan. They asked not to be identified because the policy isnt yet public.Modi wants to raise renewable capacity to 175 gigawatt by 2022 from 45 gigawatts at present. In addition to meeting its own energy targets, which Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates may cost $200 billion, India wants to emulate industrial developments in neighbouring China, where solar manufacturers have created a world-leading export industry.The Prayas programme, part of Modis Make in India campaign, is intended to create 5 gigawatts of photovoltaic manufacturing capacity from 2019 and build 20 gigawatts of projects in the country by 2026, according to the officials. The policy, which is being developed by the ministry in charge of renewable energy and industrial policy, along with the Niti Aayog government research group, will be presented to the finance ministry within a month before going to the cabinet for final approval, they said.Catching ChinaLast month power minister Piyush Goyal said in Mumbai that a policy to encourage domestic manufacturing of solar equipment is in works. When reached on phone, the spokesman for the power and renewable energy ministries declined to comment.India has become one of the biggest clients of Chinese photovoltaic manufacturers and in the absence of its own domestic capacity, that reliance could potentially grow. In the first six months of 2016, India imported 18% of Chinas production worth $1.1 billion, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.Indias policy proposal, expected to create thousands of jobs, is also in response to the industrys demand for help to the countrys solar manufacturers, one official said, adding that multiple tenders of a few hundred megawatts each would be issued for the manufacture of everything from wafers to modules.Price advantage?The government could offer about Rs.90 lakh a megawatt for manufacturing tenders and Rs.50 lakh a megawatt for local deployment, according to one of the officials, who said the numbers are subject to change.The plan might give a price advantage if the manufacturing-hub logistics are well planned, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst Jenny Chase. Money alone isnt a sufficient incentive for companies to set up the most high-tech automated factories needed to compete, she said.Japans SoftBank Group Corp. told Bloomberg News last month its considering a manufacturing joint venture in India that could produce the solar panels needed to meet Modis energy targets.To build large-scale manufacturing efficiency matching Chinese economics of scale will require government support, Manoj Kohli, executive chairman of SB Energy said in an interview in New Delhi.

-0.9,"Kolkata: Giving his group a new identity five years ago, Sanjiv Goenka said he was breaking away from legacies to build new ones. 
				   
				Less than a year earlier, he and his brother Harsh Goenka, chairman of the RPG Group, had partitioned between themselves a bunch of family-run businesses and personal assets spread across India.Things were still volatile within the extended Goenka family when in July 2011 Sanjiv Goenka announced the launch of the RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group, creating a new identity for the companies managed by him.Five years on, as he reflects on the cultural transformation of the group, Goenka says his group has earned the right to grow by improving efficiencies. The task was to shift focus from revenue to efficiency, and Goenka turned to consulting firms McKinsey & Co. and Boston Consulting Group for advice on how to lead this transformation. In the process, he ruffled a few feathers within the group. Fathers long face notwithstanding, he led the transformation, Sanjiv Goenka said, referring to the late Rama Prasad Goenka, who died in April 2013. Edited excerpts from an interview:What was the mandate for the consulting firms?Historically, the undivided RPG Group was focused primarily on revenue and not on operational efficiency. Because previously we operated in a protected environment, efficiency was not as relevant as it is now in a highly competitive environment.But once the partition happened, we brought in McKinsey & Co. and Boston Consulting Group to advise us on two things: structurally, what we should do to grow and operationally, how to improve efficiencies. The two firms worked across the group.Internally, at that stage, I took a call that we will not expand unless we could manage the expanded capacity in the most efficient manner by global standardsno growth at all, unless operationally we could make the most of it. So, breaking from tradition, I said we have to earn our right to grow.It initially took a lot of courage, a lot of self-assurance to take that standto say, for instance, that we will not chase ultra-mega power projectsbecause I was swimming against tide. But it was clear in my mind that we will not add scale only for the sake of scaling up. We will instead focus on how to get our house in order, weeding out inefficiencies.So, we started to have two review meetings a month for every company: one to discuss operational efficiencies and another to review strategic initiatives. These were unknown in our group previouslypeople here were rarely asked questions.How did your employees react?There was, for the first couple of months, some resistance from within the group. But that was only for about two months or so.One day, three of our CEOs (chief executive officers) and a CFO (chief financial officer) walked into my room and I immediately realized something was amiss. They said that I had started to act like the owner. So, I asked them if I should not. They said, of course, I should, but at the same time, they said they felt that I had stopped to trust them. By the time I met my father later in the day, they had taken the matter to him. And with a long face, he told me that I had hurt key people in the group and that he wasnt happy about it at all.To my mind, these people didnt resist change because they were incapable of coping with it. They resisted the change because they were being forced out of their comfort zone. The tussle went on for about two months, but after that, everyone rallied around the change.Today, we are a leaner and more efficient organization of some 52,000 people. The average age of our CEOs now is 50 compared with 65 previously.How has the group gained from this change?Traditionally, executing projects ground upor greenfield ventureswas not our strong suit. But in the last five years, we have executed several projectstwo power plants and two carbon black facilities, to name a fewand all of them have been completed on time and within budgets.Then McKinsey advised us to get into business process outsourcing (BPO), and we came across the Firstsource opportunity. We closed the acquisition within four weeks. We have turned around Firstsource, which was effectively in losses at the time we took it over, to deliver profits in excess of Rs300 crore in three years.We have pared its indebtedness from Rs2,400 crore at the time of acquisition to Rs600 crore. And we have done all these by scaling up competencies.As a group, our revenue has jumped from Rs7,800 crore five years ago to Rs18,000 crore. Our gross assets have gone up by Rs20,000 crore to Rs32,000 crore, and if you look at annual cash flows, our Ebidta (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) has gone up from Rs1,200 crore to Rs3,500 crore.And by the end of 2018-19, the groups net profit is going to go up from Rs1,500 crore to Rs2,200 crore as Spencers and the Chandrapur power station starts to turn in profits. Its been a quiet period, but at the same time, a period of intense growth.How is Spencers doing?Spencers has just turned Ebidta-positive. Every month, it is making enough money to meet all costs except interest on its loans. The outstanding loans arent big and very soon we will pay off everything. I am happy that because of Shashwats (Goenka) personal intervention, we have managed to pare costs by about Rs300 crore. (Spencers Retail Ltd, an arm of CESC Ltd, runs department stores.)Phillips Carbon Black also appears to have turned around...Yes, it is now turning in a profit of Rs10 crore a month. We have completely reinvented the business. Whereas previously feedstock used to come from the US sailing for six months, we now source it from other countries which are closer by. The biggest problem with the earlier arrangement was inventory losses. Now, our working capital cycles have shortened, and we dont have the problem of booking losses even before the feedstock had arrived.What is the strategy for CESC going forward?We have decided that we will avoid businesses that are government intervention intensive. So, for CESC, the future lies in distribution. We generate about 2,500MW currently, which we will increase to 3,000MW, but our focus will be on expanding our distribution business. The Chandrapur unit, which had some difficulties earlier on, is coming out of the woods. We now have buyers for almost its entire capacity, which means all our costs are covered, except interest.And Saregama?It is being transformed into a Mumbai-headquartered production house, generating content for online consumption. With data getting cheaper on every network, we are of the view that the demand for content is only going to grow. So, from being one of the richest repositories of Indian music of different genres, we are turning ourselves into a production house, which will also leverage our strengths from the past. Currently, 14 films are under production by not-so-famous directorssay by people who have assisted award-winning directors. Each has a budget of Rs1-1.5 crore and is to be produced in 2-3 months. I am not saying that they are not to be released in theatres, but the primary aim is to release them online.

				Its 3pm. Pramath Raj Sinha hasnt had lunch. The 52-year-old entrepreneur had flown into Mumbai that morning and had just finished speaking at a business school event on education. Sinha was the founding dean of the Indian School of Business (ISB), Hyderabad, and is co-founder of Ashoka University, Sonipat, Haryana. His most recent venture is the Vedica Scholars Programme for Women in Delhi, an alternative masters in business administration (MBA) programme. This all-women residential programme tries to address the problem that far more women graduate from high school than men, but get left behind in careers. Sinha says he was inspired by institutions like Wellesley College of Massachusetts, US, where women get the confidence to express themselves. The Vedica curriculum includes subjects that many conventional MBAs neglect, like politics, sociology and history. The first batch of 36 Vedica scholars has just graduated and Sinha informs me that one student has received an offer from Google at a starting salary of Rs22 lakh.By now we have settled into our seaside seats and turned our attention to the menu. We debate the relative merits of keema ghotala (a spicy Parsi keema with bread), a smoked salmon sandwich or a BLT burger, and end up settling for the latter two. Sinha grew up in Patna, in a house with a printing press. His father and grandfather were writers. Writing didnt pay all the bills, so Sinhas father started a small textbook-publishing business to supplement his income and pay for the education of his four childrenthree daughters and Pramath, who was the youngest. Sinha recalls going on marketing trips with his father in winter. We called it canvassing; we would fill the car with calendars and diaries and call on schoolteachers with these gifts. I thought it was a lot of fun; only later I realized it was serious marketing, he says. Years later, it was another printing press that drew Sinha back to the country of his birth. By then, he was an alumnus of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, with a PhD in applied mechanics and robotics from the University of Pennsylvania, US, and had been working as a consultant since 1993 with McKinsey & Co. in Toronto. And then one day he was assigned to a project on newsprint. The project was  in Canada, but it had an India component. Sinha tells me about the days he spent in India at the time, visiting newspaper offices and finally working at the Ballarpur Industries paper plant as part of the project. It was an almost surreal existence. At one level you are working for McKinsey, which in Toronto was boardrooms and office and always talking to CEOs. Here in India, I was in a paper plant in Haryana, living in a guest house with an Indian toilet and a dhobi visiting every day. We were sitting in our ganjis every night because it was so hot. Hanging out with the workers, speaking in Bhojpuri with the Bihari labourers, having shouting matches with the union. Such experiences, and work in the newsprint and media sector in India, made Sinha want to return. He started working with McKinsey India in 1995 on a project basis and moved full-time in 1997.By now the salmon sandwich and the BLT burger have arrived, and we have half portions of each, complete with fries. Sinha begins talking about the ISB story. He was involved with the institute right from the planning stage and even took a year off from McKinsey to be the founding dean. The story has all the elements of high dramaa cast of powerful industrialists, including Adi Godrej, Anand Mahindra and Rajat Gupta, chief ministers, and complicated negotiations. Most of these took place 1999 onwards, but for Sinha, the introduction to education and institutions had come even earlier.In 1995, McKinsey India began working on a project with management guru Kenichi Ohmae and then Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, on ways to transform that country into a knowledge economy. Sinha was assigned to this project, and it became the first of many such university projects for him. A PhD in robotics doesnt make you a guy who knows how to build a university, says Sinha of those early days. But this was where he first began institution-building. The ISB started as a project McKinsey was doing with the Indian Institute of Technology, DelhiSinha has since come out with a book about setting it up, An Idea Whose Time Has Come: The Story Of The Indian School Of Business.Over a cup of Darjeeling first flush, Sinha tells me about the day ISBs board of governors visited three states and three chief ministers. Their first stop was Hyderabad, where then chief minister Chandrababu Naidu pulled out all the stops. The chief minister sent his ratha to receive us, a bus with sofa seats, and we were taken to the site for the business school. On the way back to the airport, the bus was redirected to the CMs house. He welcomed us all, garlanded us and served us breakfast in his house. Afterwards we were taken to an adjoining room and given a presentation on Hyderabad as a knowledge hub, Sinha recalls. The team was charmed, but behind schedule. In Bengaluru, then chief minister J.H. Patel and his team were furious at the delay. The CM didnt speak a single word to us. And then when we reached Chennai, we were asked to garland the CM, Jayalalithaa. We were taken to see the venue which was supposed to have a lake, and we walked and walked to see the lake, but there was no lake. So in one day, we saw three chief ministers, all such contrasts of each other. One garlanded us, the other didnt speak to us and the third wanted us to garland her, Sinha says. Not surprisingly, the ISB was built in Hyderabad. Sinha is currently on its executive and governing boards.From being the founding dean of ISB, Sinha returned to work at McKinsey in 2002, then left to head the ABP Pvt. Ltd as the groups managing director and CEO in 2006. In 2007, he set up his own media company, 9.9 Mediaworx Pvt. Ltd. Like much of the media, 9.9 has had uneven economic growth. Its Rs45-crore-turnover business in 2015-16 includes magazines and websites like Digit, CIO, CFO and some consulting projects. In 2010, Sinha tried setting up a business school in Vadodara on the lines of the ISB but had to give up the idea because the school was not able to generate enough demand at the price point he had thought of. Currently, he is working with consulting and implementing project proposals at the Crescent School of Business in Chennai, the Anant National University in Ahmedabad and the Shoolini University in Solan. The Union government is planning a railway university in Vadodara and Sinha plans to bid for that project. Sinha and his wife Gauri live in Delhi. They dont have children, so Sinha says he has all the time to fill my weekends and free time with all the different things I do. By 5pm, Sinha is ready to leave for the airport for his flight back to Delhi. His last meeting for the day is with an alumnus of Ashoka, a Young India fellow.

-0.62,"Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus of Tata Sons Ltd, served as chairman of the Tata group from 1991 till 2012. He continues to head the groups charitable trusts. The groups philanthropic initiatives are wide ranging and have evolved with the changing economic conditions of the country. Starting with building institutions of repute to hospitals, to research facilities for the socioeconomic integration of the marginalized communities, the groups social engagement has been moulded and influenced by the family values of the Tatas. He talks about why poverty alleviation is key to his philanthropy, how his grandmother influenced him about how to stimulate the wealthy to give more, why access to natural resources is important to improve lives and the India Philanthropy Initiative. Edited excerpts from an interview conducted by Bridgespan in partnership with Mint:
				   
				How did you start your philanthropic journey?I grew up in a family that was driven by philanthropy. My grandmother with whom we spent a great deal of timeshe brought us up because my parents were separatedinfluenced me. We were steeped into philanthropy, whether it would be for the household staff or the person on the street. She was in fact for a period of time, the chairperson of the Sir Ratan Tata Trust. We grew up in that aura of giving back to the people or alleviating misery if we could. Formally I became involved with philanthropy when I became a trustee of the Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Were there people or incidents or experiences that you used to inform your approach to philanthropy, the formal version of it?As a young man growing up, it was the environment that I spoke of, which set the pace and the tone of my journey of how one makes contributions to make a difference.How is the Sir Ratan Tata Trust changing from its old avatar?We look at our trusts collectively. The bigger ones undertook projects of philanthropy which were very far reaching in those days, be it a cancer hospital or a hotel that would be open to Indians or donations in the interest of tuberculosis. My grandmother gave away all the homes she and her husband had all over India so that sanatoriums for consumptive people, who needed to be isolated, could be made or old peoples homes could be set up. And then a fair amount of philanthropy was in the form of alleviating individual hardships, such as funds for treatment or surgery. We give much more than we did in those days but we are trying to be relevant. We are trying to participate in research for cancer, for diabetes, getting institutes in place to make the treatments affordable and reachable to the common man, looking at agricultural inputs that alleviate poverty in a rural community. What has led to this shift broadly?I cant say that there was a motivator that was defined. For example, one of the big changes has been combating malnutrition today among infants. Just the fact that we are losing so many children in India at infancy. It took only a few weeks of research to realize that we couldnt do that without involving the mother, who is also malnutritioned. We also found out very fast that we couldnt really do much unless we focused on hygiene and sanitation. It become a holistic activity. We undertook pilot projects in eight districts across multiple states to work out the systems for this and its been a real eye-opener. We have received tremendous support from the state government whom we were working with.Any advice for a philanthropist thinking about doing problem solving?The only advice I would give is there is a lot of money that is probably less effectively used or employed because someone has not done enough research on what the problems are. One of the changes we made is that we are no longer a purely grant-giving philanthropic organization. We moved from there into being involved ourselves in some of the projects that we have, we manage them ourselves or jointly with an NGO (non-governmental organization) but not only through an NGO.In the past, we would support an NGO for eight years or 10 years and then move those funds and allocate in another place. You would assume that this community by now would be self-sustaining. But when you withdrew your funds, the NGO collapsed, the community collapsed and you become the most hated person or hated organization there is. Sustainability in development has been a new call and we realize that communities dont need handoutsthey need prosperity and dignity. So our grants today, wherever we give them, put sustainability as one of the mileposts. I mean as far as possible, the idea is to make the community self-sustaining and have the dignity which I think everybody wants. How do you measure your success ?I think to a great extent it is about trying to establish and understanding what the real problems are. You have got to define your goals effectively.What characterizes a professionalized NGO?I cant answer that particularly but sometimes its not scale. Very often an NGO tends to forget the traditional outlooks of a community and ignore it, so that what they try to dohowever well intentioneddoesnt work.What is your assessment of the current state of CSR (corporate social responsibility) in India? And what needs to be done to improve it?I have a sort of philosophical view. The CSR funds have to come from somewhere. I think there would be a fair amount of abuse of these funds and the government will have to do some regulation to make sure that these are effectively used. It would not be a bad thing if the government had defined X number of causes to which you can officially give these funds, which would work for rural prosperity. I think even if large projects, a public works projects, were funded in this way, there is nothing wrong in that but the government may have to define what they are. CSR could become an avenue for innovative thinking on how you can improve the quality of life, and it could be a very powerful toolor it could be wasted. How do you see the state of philanthropy in India?I think the new type of philanthropy that we talked about, that is looking at making donations or making funds available in far-reaching terms, is starting to happen. But a large amount of philanthropy is in the more traditional formsmaybe to build temples or hospitals, not so concerned about what it actually does, but that edifices are created because that establishes that you did A or B or C. I think India has to move like other countries into a more sophisticated form of philanthropy which makes a difference and is designed to make a difference rather than just creating edifices. Do you have a philosophy of philanthropy?If I put it into one sentence, I think you really want to be doing things that make a difference. If you cannot make a difference, if its just water trickling through a tap or leading through a drainage system, its wasteful. Have you changed because of the philanthropy? How has it affected you?Yes I think so. I was the chairman of the trust while I was chairman of Tata Sons. I may have chaired the trust but I didnt spend as much time or have had much depth of involvement as I do today and thats been an eye-opener. I have become more sensitive to the pain and the suffering that exists. I am more involved with where we should do more and where we should be bolder in terms of the amount of money that we allocate. And it also made me more sensitive to the likely abuse of funds.The Bridgespan Group, an adviser and resource for mission-driven leaders and organizations, in partnership with Mint interviewed several philanthropists across India to trace their journeys and share their learningsConversations with Remarkable Givers: India.ALSO READ | Philanthropy benefits the philanthropistALSO READ | How a small donation secures freedomALSO READ | Strategic giving for impact",2016-10-03,eZ5raUtIs7kmScXuchQY9M,Tata Sons chairman emeritus Ratan Tata on why poverty alleviation is key to his philanthropy and why access to natural resources is important to improve lives,competitor,03:03,You really want to be doing things that make a difference: Ratan Tata
-0.83,"Bengaluru: Bhaskar Bhat, 62, has been at the helm of Tata group firm Titan Co. Ltd for nearly 15 years. His association with the Tata Watch Project, which eventually led to the creation of Titan, has continued for more than three decades, during which he has seen the Titan brand expand from watches into jewellery, eyewear and precision engineering.
				   
				About four months ago, Titan entered yet another categorytraditional womens wearas part of a pilot project, while watches and jewellery continue to be its mainstay, accounting for a major portion of its revenue. Unlike the jewellers in the unorganized sector who have been hit by demonetization, Titan expects the governments move to help boost its sales in the longer run. The company estimates it has less than 5% market share in jewellery and therefore abundant headroom for growth.As of now there are no acquisition plans in the pipeline, says Bhat, and the companys focus is on integrating brands such as CaratLane in jewellery and Favre-Leuba in watches and Maison Montblancwhich makes jewellery, writing instruments and leather goodsas all these were acquired less than two years ago. In an interview, Bhat spoke about the companys key business segments and the fillip it expects from demonetization. Edited excerpts:How has this fiscal year shaped up so far and what kind of growth rate do you expect over the next two years?Overall, like we reported, we had been growing in the first six months, by a small amount, but still, growth was there. In fact, we even said that were expecting a 15% growth in the jewellery business and we expect to clock those numbers. In watches also, the growth rates are better than last year. So the year as such is better, that much I can say. We will be able to keep our current rate of growth, i.e. 15%. Whether it will be much more for FY18 and the year after, we cannot say. But for us FY18 will be better than the current year primarily because demonetization has, in a way, sucked the winds out of the sails of the unorganized sector. Do you expect any fallout from demonetization on Titans future performance? Right now I can confidently say that the concerns because of demonetizationfor instance, concerns that there is no cash for daily transactions so I wont buy watcheshas diminished considerably. It was an event that has affected most companies and we have also articulated that we did get affected in the first week to 10 days. After that, normalcy has come back; the informal (unorganized) economy was affected whereas it has not affected us. In the end, consumers have to buy jewellery, watches and eyewear. If the unorganized sector is not able to give them the product, theyll have to come to us, right?Companies that were doing business in black will not be able to transform to our kind of model or any other kind of model where you accept credit cards and cheques, you keep your books of accounts and you pay taxes. Thats not a transition which will occur easily. And that is where the demand which is there, fundamentally, will flow to companies that can and have been operating legitimately.Youve said in the past that the jewellery industry will be full of turmoil due to policy changes. Is that still your expectation, in particular for this year? Over the past two years, there has been considerable turmoil in the jewellery industry. Gold-on-lease was stopped and later restored, customs duty was increased from 6% to 10%. Then excise duty was introduced and, if you remember, stores were closed for 43 days. Disclosing PAN cards was introduced for purchases above Rs5 lakh and then further dropped to those over Rs 2 lakh. And then we had demonetization. But I think jewellers have now learnt a lesson. At what rate the government decides to impose GST (goods and services tax) is the only other policy change in store and that will benefit us because a lot of the jewellers will have to fall in linedemonetization plus GST is a nightmare for them. So we should benefit from FY18 onward.Which of your jewellery brands are you betting big on and do you expect sales from your Golden Harvest Scheme (GHS) to get a significant boost going ahead?There is a lot of excitement in CaratLane, which we acquired, and Mia. Both are appealing to younger consumers. But between Tanishq, Mia, Zoya, CaratLaneTanishq is certainly the biggest brand. It is a very steady high-growth brand and is at a very high level of sales. Sales from GHS are basically advance booking orders; so youve got a guarantee that one year later at least this much business you will do. Its always been 15-20% of our sales. We aggressively push GHS. Maybe its contribution to sales can increase a little more but I dont see it becoming the new normal.Watches and eyewear have not been doing too well. Whats the plan to boost sales? Watches are bought today as an accessory, not as a time-keeping device. So the strategy is clearly accessorization and premiumization. Getting into the smartwatch segment is also a strategy that weve introduced and were doing well at it. Eyewear has been slow this year, yes. Right now the effort is in ensuring existing stores grow rather than new stores. Growth will come out of the so-called same-store sales growth mantra. Is Titan planning to enter any new categories? We began piloting traditional womens wear in October and are looking at opening a physical store. And we still have to grow perfumes, for example, which is still at a level of Rs30-40 crore. So we dont have any other category in the pipeline. What is your strategy when it comes to competing with online marketplaces? We participate, we dont compete. In watches, we are with online marketplaces like Flipkart and Myntra, and we have a strict contractual obligation with them as to what price they can sell our products at. Discounting is at our behest, not theirs and they have agreed to this so theyve become a partner. The biggest advantage we have is we have offline stores. Our strategy has always been omnichannel but there are very big advantages of bricks and mortar, which I think bricks-and-mortar companies need to play up and not just assume that everybody is going to migrate to online. The need to go to a store is least in watches, because watches you can buy online also, and highest in jewellery. The higher the ticket size, the more risk-averse people will get. So convenience is not everything when you are buying. And I think this trend of buying eyewear online is a passing phase. People will realize that unless you get the quality that you want, it can be quite bad. If your lens is not good enough, for example, its a risk. You also cant touch and feel your frame (before placing an order online). Youve been associated with Titan, and earlier the Tata Watch Project for about three decades. What would you say is the one significant event in the history of the company? We didnt know a thing about retail. So the first retail store we opened in Safina Plaza (a shopping complex in central Bengaluru) in the late 1980s was very memorable. It was a 350-square-foot store but it was very well designed. I remember we sold 17 watches on the first day and we were very thrilled! That was a significant event in the life of Titanthe introduction of retailing.When you look back, I dont think we ever dreamt that we would be a watches, and jewellery, and eyewear, and precision engineering company. It was inconceivable. We were just about relieved that wed got government approval to get into the watch industry and that we were able to make good watches and overtake HMT in five-six years. After that, its been kind of a dream run.",2017-02-04,eokVM94g0SpP1h72Lt1VFO,Titan MD Bhaskar Bhat on integrating brands such as CaratLane  and why he expects the jewellery business to get a boost from demonetisation,competitor,00:41,"Titan will maintain current growth rate over two years, says Bhaskar Bhat"
0.36,"Wipro Ltd reported another quarter of sluggish revenue growth; in constant currency terms, revenue grew just 0.9% in the September quarter. Besides, it has guided for growth of only 0-2% in the December quarter.
				   
				But investors have got used to sub-par growth rates from the company. Whats unusual is the aggression it has shown lately in trying to get out of this low-growth rut.On Thursday, Wipro announced the acquisition of Appirio Inc., a US-based cloud services firm for $500 million. The firm has annual revenue of less than $200 million, implying a pricey tag of around 2.5 times revenue. Note that such firms typically operate with single-digit operating margins, which means the price-earnings valuation of the asset may be as high as 50-70 times.Analysts are convinced the deal will be earnings dilutive in the near term. But they are also excited about the companys prospects. Appirio is one of the largest independent cloud services implementation partner for SaaS (software as a service) vendors such as Salesforce and Workday. Wipro  also gets access to one of the largest crowdsourcing communities called Topcoder. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients, The acquisition leapfrogs Wipro in Salesforce and Workday implementation over other Indian IT (firms) and places it among the top-5 players globally along with IBM, Accenture and Deloitte. Besides, they said the deal would enhance Wipros ability to take this capability to its existing large clients; improves its digital positioning and also open up opportunities for integrated deals as opposed to simple reliance on implementation revenue.While Wipro is already present in this segment, revenue from the practice stood at just $40 million. Analysts at Nomura said the acquisition will put Wipro ahead of its Indian IT peers, besides helping the company transition well in the ongoing shift from on-premise software to SaaS.On 11 February, Wipro announced the $460 million acquisition of HealthPlan Services, a leading business process as a service (BPaaS) provider in the US health insurance market. It had also closed in on another BPaaS provider, Viteos, although the deal was called off after it took too long to close. Kotaks analysts point out that the company is also actively engaged in in-house development of BPaaS solutions, and has been investing in platforms and intellectual property. Wipro is playing quick catch up after initial lag in digital with clear identifiable bets. Some of the acquisitions will hurt the P&L (profit and loss) and lead to dilution of earnings. Wipro is willing to take the hit in order to create a more sustainable growth engine and business model, the analysts said in the note.Peers have been relatively cautious and have lagged in terms of investments in emerging technology and solutions. As a result, their growth, too, has slowed, while competitors such as Accenture Plc have done far better, thanks to numerous acquisitions in recent years.Of course, the Streets response to Wipros deals has been a bit restrained. The companys shares have underperformed again this year. One reason is investors tend to be myopic and focus on short-term performance. The other is that Wipro, like most Indian IT firms, doesnt have a great track record of integrating acquisitions well. According to analysts at JPMorgan India Pvt. Ltd, Infocrossing, the companys last large acquisition, had not helped Wipro consolidate its then-leadership position in IT infrastructure-management. It was acquired for $600 million in August 2007. If anything, they add, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd took over leadership in infra-management despite Wipros large acquisition.But clearly, Wipro cant be faulted for not trying.

-0.22,"The first repercussions of the impending departure of Raghuram Rajan from the Reserve Bank of India could now be visibleand it looks like those who argued the independence of Indias central bank was under threat may have been right.
				   
				Indias aspirations
Rajan declared last month that he would not be seeking the expected extension of his terma move widely seen as being forced on him by the Narendra Modi-led government in New Delhi, which had publicly disagreed with several of his decisions and statements as governor. This was troubling. The government appeared to be uncomfortable with its inability, under Rajan, to direct the central banks actions. The implications for the RBIs institutional stability and strengthand for the credibility of India as an investment destinationwerent good.Some of Rajans latest speeches suggest the government is close to knocking a further hole in the RBIs authority. The governor has spoken out against a suggestion, which is gathering force in New Delhi, to use surplus funds with the RBIits contingent reserve, set aside for emergenciesto recapitalize stressed state-owned banks.The governments motivations are understandable. It has committed itself to a pretty stringent path of fiscal consolidation over the next few years, one that would bring the fiscal deficit down to 3% of gross domestic product. However it has to do this at the same time as Indian banksin particular, the state-controlled banks that comprise 70% of the sectorare dealing with a full-blown bad loans crisis. Estimates of bad loans vary widely, but may total anywhere between six and 12% of GDP. The RBI itself estimates they may hit 8.5% of GDP by next March.Recapitalizing the banks is urgentthey need about $140 billion in capital by 2019, according to Fitch Ratingsbut the government has set aside very little money to do so as yet. And soon after the next federal budget is presented at the end of February 2017, Modis government will probably go into election mode. Polls are due in 2017 in the crucial northern state of Uttar Pradesh, and the next general elections will be just two years away at that point. Its obviously tempting to use the RBIs funds instead of finding money from the general budget.Such a move would reverse years of institutional evolution at the central bank. The RBI used to own significant stakes in some major Indian banksa conflict of interest for the central bank, which regulates the banking sector. Even though a government-appointed committee recommended as early as 1998 that these shares be sold, it wasnt till 2010 that the sale actually took place. Rajans fear is that the current administration wants to reverse this processand hes right, doing so would be disastrous.Other bad ideas for plundering the RBIs reserves have been floated before. In 2004, some ministers wanted to tap $5 billion a year from the surplus fund to finance Indias infrastructure-building program. Fortunately, the RBIwith some timely help from the International Monetary Fundmanaged to hold off the government, greatly enhancing its reputation for independence. (Its worth noting that in this, it did better than the US Federal Reserve, which wasnt able to stave off a law passed by the US Congress last December that dipped into its surplus to pay for US highways.)An attempt to use the RBIs rainy-day cash pile would not just dent the central banks independence, but also the credibility of Indias already shaky fiscal arithmetic. It would make accounting for the exact amount that the government was spending impossible, as well as have unpredictable effects on inflation. It would thus vastly set back the RBIs efforts under Rajan to establish a reputation as an inflation-fighting central bank.Worryingly, the governments apparent willingness to compromise RBI independence seems in keeping with several of its recent decisions. The controversial departure of Rajan is one such. The purpose was presumably to replace him with a choice with whom the government is more comfortable, perhaps its chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian, who first suggested dipping into RBI funds in his annual economic survey earlier this year.The fact that the government has chosen to ignore the obvious means of recapitalizing banks is also revealing. The state-owned banking sector shouldnt be bailed out using RBI funds, of coursebut not by using tax money either. Instead, it should be guided towards privatization, and funds for recapitalizing the best banks should be raised from the markets. But movement on this is slow. Modi himself doesnt seem too sympathetic to privatization.Indias prime minister came into office promising maximum governance, minimum government. Thats what both the RBI and the banking sector need, not renewed state control.

0.16,"The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday gave the green signal to Tata Sons Ltd to hold a planned shareholder meeting on 6 February, which will consider a proposal to remove former chairman Cyrus P Mistry as a director from its board. 
				   
				The tribunal refused to grant a stay despite being pressed by the counsel of Mistrys family investment firms, Aryama Sundaram. This bench has not passed any stay on the EGM (extraordinary general meeting) scheduled for 6th February. ... Relief (to Mistry family firms) is recused. Now either the petitioner can file an appeal or be bound by an order, said B.S.V. Prakash Kumar, one of the two members of the NCLT bench.Earlier this month, the Mistry firms filed a contempt of court petition seeking a stay on the Tata Sons EGM. This has been dismissed by the NCLT, which asked the firms to club it with their original petition alleging mismanagement of Tata Sons and oppression of minority shareholders. Cyrus Mistry was ousted as chairman of Tata Sons in a boardroom putsch on 24 October.The bench asked Sundaram, the counsel for Cyrus Investments Pvt. Ltd and Sterling Investments Pvt. Ltd, to argue the merits of the original petition. Sundaram asked the NCLT to first clarify whether the petition was maintainable. In its response to the Mistry family firms petition, Tata Sons had said that the two firms were not qualified to file such a petition because they didnt hold enough equity under Company Act rules.Cyrus Investments and Sterling Investments together own 18.4% of the ordinary shares of Tata Sons, but only 2.17% if preference shares are included, said the holding company of the Tata group. Similarly, the Tata Trusts, which control two-thirds of Tata Sons, said that any suit filed against them needed the permission of the charity commissioner.This (equity) class of shareholders is affected and since we form 18% of the equity shareholders, the petition is maintainable and we have the right to appeal if we feel there is going to be a change in the board. Changes in the board are done through EGMs, which qualifies equity shareholders only to vote. Since we form 18% of that class, the petition is valid and maintainable, Sundaram argued.This did not work.This bench is virtually perplexed. None of the judgments of the Supreme Court or sections of the Companies Act cited by the petitioner counsel is in relation to the matter of maintainability. Moreover, normally maintainability point will be taken from the respondent side. But here the petitioner is arguing on the point of maintainability, said Prakash Kumar.The bench expressed its displeasure, saying that the Mistry family firms counsel was not cooperating with the proceedings. The tribunal said it will not spell out the judgement on maintainability separately and will hear  arguments on maintainability only as a part of the overall arguments made on the original petition. It asked Sundaram to argue on the merits of the original petition on 13 February, the next day of the hearing. After concluding hearings on behalf of the Mistry firms, the tribunal will hear Tata Sons arguments on 20 and 21 February.While agreeing to postpone the hearing from Mistrys side by two weeks, Prakash Kumar said, The petitioner counsel cant argue on the matter and is only asking for adjournment.

The meaning is that he cant and is not ready to argueThe road map was already laid out on 22 December and thereafter on 18 January.

0.84,"New Delhi/Mumbai: Desperate to develop its own mineral deposits, resource-hungry India is trying to revive investment by taking aim at illegal miners like the sand mafiafrom a few hundred feet in the air.
				   
				The government will deploy flying camera drones to track renegades who for years have been extracting everything from sand to coal to iron ore without permits. Unsanctioned diggers pay no tax, violate the mineral rights of others and employ rudimentary methods blamed for widespread environmental damage. Theyre also hard to catch, working in remote areas and sometimes getting help from corrupt officials.What happens in most of the cases is that when we reach those areas, people get a whiff of it and they run away, they remove their workers, they remove everything, said Piyush Sharma, technical secretary at Indian bureau of mines in Nagpur. Drones will be effective in a way that we will have pictures, which can be used as evidence.Rogue miners have gotten so bad that the government in 2012 shut down all iron ore pits in a western state that was the source of half Indias exports of the mineral. A judicial panel estimated illegal operators in Goa had siphoned off Rs34,940 crore ($5 billion) of ore while dumping toxic waste in rivers and farmland and destroying forest habitat. The ban turned the country from the worlds third-largest exporter of iron ore to a net importer.One of the biggest mineral thefts is sand dredged from ocean beaches and river beds. Unlicensed extraction has caused flooding and threatened marine life like the endangered Gangetic dolphin. But demand for it as a building material in cement and concrete has soared with the expanding economy. In the year that starts 1 April, the government plans to spend $59 billion to modernize railways, airports and roads. It also plans to build 10 million homes for the poor by 2019 and provide electricity to about 240 million people who dont have it.Bureaucratic barriersSand thieves arent the only problem. As growth in Asias second-largest economy fueled a surge in demand for imported raw materials, theres been a lack of investment in domestic mineral reserves. Excessive delays in getting permits led foreign companies like Rio Tinto Group and South Koreas Posco to withdraw huge projects in frustration, and Bangalore-based Deccan Gold Mines Ltd. hasnt mined a single ounce of the metal after 13 years of trying.Using unmanned aerial surveillance of mines can help restore confidence in the governments ability to protect mineral rights and control activity, according to Balvider Kumar, Indias secretary of mines. In addition to tracking the illegal miners and their trucks, the government will have another tool in helping to monitor authorized operations, determine lease boundaries and aid in exploration.In some of the states, illegal mining is a matter of concern as it is taking place on a very massive scale, Kumar said by telephone from New Delhi. Drones can help us find out how much material has been mined by a company and whether correct royalties or taxes have been paid to the government.Thats a big improvement to the current system for monitoring mines and tracking cheats that relies on local complaints and unconfirmed reports, with few ways for the government to follow up to see if action was taken, according to the ministry. The government also began a mining surveillance program in October that employs satellite and remote-sensing technology to help curb illegal activities, according to the Indian Bureau of Mines.Flying eyesEarlier this month, Tata Steel Ltd.s Noamundi iron ore mine became the first in the country to use drone technology on an area spread over 1,160 hectares (2,866 acres) in the state of Jharkhand.State-run exploration agencies and the Indian Institute of Technology are studying drone use over river beds to identify potential trouble spots. Companies also can use thermal cameras in the drones to monitor mines at night, and the technology can provide images that make it easier to map exploration areas that might otherwise take months to complete on foot.The surveillance upgrade is just part of Indias bid to encourage more mineral investment. In 2015,  Prime Minister Narendra Modi decided to switch to competitive auctions for allocating resource rights, after years of discretionary or free allotments led to bruising corruption scandals. While most companies dont like having to re-bid on deposits they find, the government says it wants a more transparent model. The process for getting licences also was simplified.Luring investmentThose are the kinds of changes that Piyush Goyal, who helped to revive the countrys coal production, expects will lure more legal investments in domestic mineral extraction. Goyal, who is the minister of state with independent charge of power, coal, new and renewable energy and mines, predicts spending will surge more than sevenfold to 1 trillion rupees over five years, doubling mine output and reducing dependence on foreign raw materials.India imports almost all of the copper concentrate it uses and is one of the worlds biggest buyers of steel, aluminum, iron ore, gold and coal, mines ministry data show. But the country has yet to fully tap mineral riches that the government estimates are on par with those of major exporters like Canada, Australia, Brazil, South Africa, Chile and Mexico, according to the Central Statistical Organization.Many of those countries are already using drone technology, as are other industries. Indonesia used them at tin mines and to track production at oil-palm and rubber plantations. China employs drones to monitor pollution, while some farmers use them to spread herbicides and photograph plants, according to the digital association Bitkom.Drones are being recognized as the technology of the future, said Sharma, the technical secretary at the Indian bureau of mines.Bloomberg",2017-02-02,fy5nTXrGWaQIIshcdz8jvL,The government will deploy flying camera drones to track renegades who for years have been extracting everything from sand to coal to iron ore without permits,competitor,15:15,Catching illegal sand men is key to make mining pay off in India 
0.13,"New Delhi: Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Thursday that his ministry was assessing the actions of former officials at Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) and upstream regulator, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), since 2007 relating to a dispute between the state-run company and Reliance Industries Ltd around flow of gas between their connected reservoirs in the Krishna-Godavari basin.
				   
				Once the assessment is completed, the ministry is expected to bring provisions to penalize energy firms for not disclosing all material information to the regulator at various stages of field development and give DGH more enforcement powers and technical expertise.Also, the ministry may take action if any individual official is found guilty of suppressing relevant information.These measures were recommended by the single-member justice A.P. Shah committee that looked into ONGCs claim that Reliance gained by producing gas from their connected reservoirs.There must be clarity on what roles the stakeholders played (relating to the dispute.) We should have transparency. We are making an internal assessment. We will bring to light whoever is responsible, Pradhan said at the economic editors conference in the capital.The Shah panel also said that the government should probe ONGCs alleged long periods of inactivity in developing the blocks awarded to it. ONGC chairman and managing director D.K. Sarraf said on 8 September that the company came to know that the reservoirs of the two companies in the KG basin were connected only in 2013, the year in which it approached the DGH on the issue. Sarraf also said then that the company had informed the Shah committee that it had no prior knowledge about flow of gas between the fields, but there was no mention of its submission in the panels report.The panel said, citing a report by DeGolyer & MacNaughton, a US-based consultancy that was hired earlier by the firms, that between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2015, about 11 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas migrated to KG D6 from adjacent fields, of which 8.9 bcm was appropriated by RIL. In a stock exchange filing on 5 November, Reliance contested the $1.5 billion claim the government made on the same day relating to the gas that seeped into its field, saying the company had worked within the boundaries of the block awarded to it and has complied with all applicable regulations and provisions of its lease.Disputes relating to natural resources do not augur well for the development of the sector.

-0.3,"New Delhi: The National Democratic Alliance government on Saturday reached out to people in Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhis constituency Amethi in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, with its flagship entitlement scheme of giving cooking gas connections to the poor, called Ujjwala Yojana and assurances on skill development and employment.
				   
				Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan along with human resource development minister Prakash Javadekar and textiles minister Smriti Irani inaugurated a permanent campus for Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology (RGIPT). The central ministers also attended the distribution of 1,000 liquified petroleum gas (LPG) connections to the poor in Amethi without an upfront security deposit. Uttar Pradesh, which is going to assembly elections early next year, is a priority state for the Ujjwala scheme as LPG access to households in the state is below the national average by 7-8 percentage points. In Uttar Pradesh, electorally Indias largest state with 403 assembly seats, the Bharatiya Janata Party os looking to repeat its 2014 Lok Sabha election performance when the NDA won 73 out of the 80 seats. In Amethi, Union minister Smriti Irani had contested and lost against Rahul Gandhi during the 2014 general elections.Responding to Pradhans invitation for the launch of the campus, Rahul Gandhi in a letter said that the previous UPA government had piloted the enactment of the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology Act 2007, making the RGIPT an institute of national importance.I am happy that this historical effort of ours is moving forward. I would, however, like to bring to your notice that a number of other major development initiatives in Amethi which had either been legislated or had received cabinet approval have not progressed during the current NDA government, Gandhi said in his letter.The polls are crucial for the BJP as a win in Uttar Pradesh would bolster the chances of the partys expansion in north India. The Congress party has is also looking to revive their position where Rahul Gandhi has just completed a month long campaign. Both the regional partiesincumbent Samajwadi Party and main opposition Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Partyare eyeing the election.This is not the first time that Smriti Irani is going to Amethi for election campaign. BJP is only trying hoping that people will get distracted through these events and forget about issues like price rise, rural distress, and deteriorating law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh, said a senior Congress leader from the state.Pradhan said his government has spent Rs.302 crore in the state for completing the RGIPT project against the Rs.129 spent between 2008-14, when Congress led-United Progressive Alliance was in power. Also, in the last two years and a half, the number of LPG connections in Amethi has more than doubled to touch two lakhs, said Pradhan. In the next two years the target is to ensure 100% penetration of LPG in the district, said an oil ministry statement quoting Pradhan. The minister also said that under the scheme meant to empowering and protecting the health of women, nearly 90 Lakh LPG connections have been released since its launch on 1 May at Balia in Uttar Pradesh by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He said that the oil ministrys target is to provide LPG connections in each and every household of Uttar Pradesh.An official involved in implementing the scheme, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said so far, 31 lakh LPG connections have been issued to those below the poverty line in Uttar Pradesh under the scheme, accounting for nearly a third of all the connections issued. Three districtsAllahabad, Kushinagar and Sitapurhave been issued connections more than one lakh each.When we started the programme, the national average of LPG access was 61% of households while the same for UP was 54%. Now, the national average has improved to 68%, while that for UP has moved up to 60%. Jammu and Kashmir, being a hill state is another priority area for the scheme, said the official. So far, more than 60,000 connections have been given in Jammu and Kashmir under Ujjwala.Political analysts say that close to the polls, the central government gets an opportunity to showcase the work being done.PM Modi himself had urged people to give up their subsidies.

The operators of the blocks will get certainty about continued production rights to go ahead with deploying technologies to enhance output.When the Union cabinet approved a similar extension on 10 March for another set of pre-1999 fields, which unlike the ones currently under review, had hydrocarbon discoveries at the time of signing the contracts, it adopted a 10% increase in the governments take of profit petroleum. The increase applies on whatever is the governments share that is calculated as per the terms in the existing contract.The 25-year lease period for Cairn India Ltds block in Barmer, RajasthanRJ-ON-90/1expires in May 2020.

0.54,"New Delhi: After dragging for more than two years, state-owned gas utility Gail India Ltd has scrapped a $7 billion tender for hiring newly built ships to ferry liquefied natural gas (LNG) from US after bidders did not agree to Make-in-India terms. 
				   
				Gail, which was forced by the oil ministry to add the Make-in-India condition to its tender, will now hire the ships from the global spot or current market to transport LNG, a senior official with knowledge of the matter said. Two Japanese biddersa consortium of Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL)-Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK Line) and Mitsui and Co. and a consortium comprising Mitsubishi Corporation-Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd (K Line) and GasLog, had sought several deviations from the tender conditions, which were not agreeable to Gail. We discussed with both the bidder the deviations they sought for over six months but when they didnt agree, we were left with no option but to cancel the tender, the official said. In the tender, Gail sought to time-charter nine newly built LNG ships of a cargo capacity of 150,000-180,000 cubic meters to LNG it has tied up from Sabine Pass and Cove Point LNG projects in US, with supplies slated to start from December 2017. Bids were sought in lots of three, with the condition that one of the three ship will be built at an Indian shipyard. The official said since Indian shipyards neither had the technology nor experience of building the highly specialised LNG ships, the bidder sought sovereign performance guarantee for the ones built in India. After postponing the deadline thrice, Gail had in February last year scrapped the tender to hire nine LNG carriers to ferry gas from the US, with a caveat that three of them be made in India. At that point, no foreign shipyard was willing to share LNG ship-building technology. Negotiations that followed saw Cochin Shipyard strike a deal with Samsung Heavy Industries Ltd to cooperate in construction of the vessels. It has also been licensed by GTT of France to build LNG carriers with the Mark III membrane containment system. However, L&T Shipbuilding, which had a deal with Hyundai Heavy Industries, has pulled out of the bidding as it turns its focus to defence projects. Pipavav Defence and Offshore Engineering has teamed up with Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering (DSME) of South Korea for ship-building. The tender was re-floated on September 15, 2015. After the deadline was postponed thrice, two consortiums put in bids on March 31 this year. The official said according to the tender condition while two ships were to be built at the shipyards of their foreign collaborators, one carrier has to be built in India. The tender document provides for the Indian shipyard taking 5-13% LNG carrier that it will build. This condition was not there in the original tender floated in 2014. Also, Gail has a right to take up to 10% equity stake in any or all of the nine ships. Shipping Corporation of India (SCI), which is to operate the carriers, will have a right to 26% interest, according to the document.

-0.44,"Have investors begun attaching greater importance to revenue growth at Essel Propack Ltd? The stock has lost ground after the packaging firm reported a tepid 3.5% rise in revenues for the June quarter (first quarter or Q1). Revenues are adjusted for a divestment Essel did last year. 
				   
				To be sure,the company has been reporting subdued revenue growth for some time nowrevenues grew in the range of 1-3% in the previous three quarters. But the stock never saw such a sharp correction after the results announcement.In fact, as Essel reported steady improvement in margins and earnings, the stock rallied 44% over the last one year. Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margins softened a bit in the June quarter. But that was due to low revenue growth. Lower-than-planned offtake by key customers and slower ramp-up of new capacities in the non-oral care category business outside India impacted revenue growth, the company said.Essel works on a cost-plus business model. So low raw material prices can suppress revenue growth. If one considers this effect, revenue growth would have been 5.5% instead of 3.5%. Even then, for a stock that rallied 44% last year and is trading at 16 times current fiscal year earnings estimates, the 5.5% growth is nothing to be excited about.Further, the results have limited cues about the prospects of seeing sustainable double-digit revenue growth that can help the stock enter the next leg of growth. In its results presentation, Essel said it expects revenue growth to recover to 12% in the coming months. Business in Africa, Middle East and the South Asia region is recovering on improvement in demand and new customer wins.But commentary on the troubled Europe and Americas businesses, which together generate more than a third of the companys revenues and were responsible for a subdued Q1, remained vague. Essel is developing non-oral care business in the US and Europe, and several new projects will be commercialized in the near term. But there is no clarity when these measures will take effect or these regions will come out of the growth slump.So analysts remain sceptical about the revenue growth trajectory. Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd has reduced earnings estimates and downgraded the stock. Another broking firm Way2Wealth Brokers Pvt. Ltd said the stock is pricing in an optimistic business cycle. The company has been able to meet its 20:20:20 vision on both the operating margin level and profit growth targets.

-0.35,"San Francisco: Apple Inc. attracted a swathe of new iPhone customers over the holiday period, auguring well for a more significant upgrade to its flagship product this year  and the services revenue that these devices are increasingly generating.
				   
				Existing iPhone users upgraded to the latest iPhone 7 models at about the same rate as the iPhone 6S a year earlier, chief executive officer Tim Cook said in a conference call with analysts. Yet Apple still managed to sell 3.5 million more phones in the three months ended 31 December, indicating growth was driven by new customers.The iPhone 7 represented a modest update to its predecessor, the 6S, adding water resistance, an improved camera, battery life and processor while retaining similar styling. Expectations are mounting for a more significant upgrade to Apples flagship product later this year, which is the 10th anniversary of the iPhones launch. That may persuade more existing iPhone users to open their wallets for the next model.When were able to innovate with new generations of products, clearly that plays a role in the upgrade rate, chief financial officer Luca Maestri said.Apple reported total revenue rose 3.3% to $78.4 billion, with earnings of $3.36 a share, in the holiday quarter, exceeding analyst forecasts. The shares gained as much as 4% in early trading on Wednesday after the results.Samsung Electronics Co. recalled its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone in September after a fault that caused some batteries to burst into flames. That reduced competition in the market for large, high-end smartphones and likely helped attract new customers, according to New York-based BTIG analyst Walt Piecyk.Once they get you in their ecosystem, theyve got a far better shot at getting you to buy another one of their phones, Piecyk said. If anything, the fact that it wasnt stickiness and services and upgrades makes you feel better about future growth.Americans are taking longer to upgrade their smartphones, partly because wireless carriers have phased out plans that offer discounts for new devices every two years. That puts more pressure on handset makers to find new customers  something Apple pulled off in late 2016.Last year, Apple suffered a rare year-over-year revenue decline, as iPhone sales tumbled, particularly in China, where competitors such as Oppo and Vivo introduced cheaper phones with similar performance. In the first fiscal quarter, sales in mainland China grew, excluding the effect of a strong US dollar, Cook said.Cooks response to last years sales decline was to push more services, such as Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud. These businesses are more profitable than iPhones and iPads, and they increase the chances customers will buy future Apple gadgets because users apps and data are tightly woven into the companys operating systems.Services revenue grew 18% to $7.2 billion in the most recent period. Apple said it aims to double the annual total to more than $50 billion by fiscal 2021.The App Store is going to be a significant driver of growth, CFO Maestri said. A lot of it comes from the fact that our installed base of devices around the world continues to grow very well. BloombergAlex Webb",2017-02-01,h7rcCJ9rCXZLik6cpynrBK,Existing iPhone users upgraded to the latest iPhone 7 models at about the same rate as the iPhone 6S a year earlier,competitor,21:07,Apple woos new iPhone fans as current owners await upgrade
0.76,"New Delhi: InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, which operates Indias biggest budget airline IndiGo, said its fiscal third-quarter profit dropped 25% because of an increase in fuel costs and lower ticket prices. 
				   
				Net profit fell to Rs487.25 crore in the three months ended 31 December from Rs657.29 crore a year earlier, the company said. Revenue rose 16.8% to Rs5,158.42 crore from Rs4,481.20 crore in the year-ago period as the company added planes and operated more flights. IndiGo controls about 39% share of the domestic market, with 126 planes and 854 daily flights. In an analyst call on Tuesday, IndiGo said its yields or airfares were down 10% in October, 20% in November, 17% in December and 10% in January year-on-year. IndiGo president Aditya Ghosh said the airline will continue to match the fares of rival airlines in each fare bucket in the coming months as wella strategy started in the second half of last year. We have the lowest cost structure, Ghosh said.During the quarter, 71.7% of IndiGo flights were on time. The airline said its operational performance was impacted primarily due to adverse weather conditions, air traffic congestion at key airports and operational issues associated with its A320neo planes.IndiGo has bet big on the A320neos Pratt & Whitney engine. The new engine has been throwing up challenges including startup issues and erroneous technical messages to the pilot since last year when some of the planes were inducted after a long delay. Some other issues are also being fixed, IndiGo said on Tuesday.There are certain issues with combustor chamber lining as a result of which we are not getting the engine life that we would have expected, Ghosh said, adding There is a redesign that Pratt is implementing to fix this. It has also talked about an issue with the oil seal that have seen some failures. Pratt is working on it. He said the delayed delivery of fan blades for the neo engines is also being addressed. The engine is giving 15% fuel savings compared with 14% earlier, he added.The airline expects to end fiscal year 2017 with a fleet of 133 planes and may induct more next fiscal than initially expected, it said.Consulting firm CAPA said IndiGos net profit per passenger dropped 47.5% to Rs430 in the December quarter from Rs820 a year earlier and predicted challenges to profitability next fiscal.Industry will add 60-65 aircraft in FY18 which will increase supply dynamics significantly and with cost creep of over 10% likely, see emerging profitability challenges, CAPA said.

-0.01,"Bengaluru: Tata Group chairman Cyrus Mistry has a new worry in the growing pile of troubles afflicting Indias largest conglomerate. How to revive growth at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), which accounts for 16% of the groups $103.5 billion revenue?
				   
				The troubles at Tata Motors Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd are well-documented. Despite TCS reporting a 3.7% sequential dollar revenue growth in the April-June period, the company is likely to report weak numbers in the second quarter, results of which will be declared on 13 October.Worryingly for investors, TCS now risks growing at a slower clip this year than last year, when its revenue expanded 7.1%, the slowest annual growth at TCS since 2009, when Natarajan Chandrasekaran took charge as its chief executive. TCS is expected to report an at-best 1.6% sequential dollar growth in the second quarter, according to brokerage BNP Paribas. This, on the back of 3.7% growth in the first quarter, translates into TCS doing $8.79 billion business in the first six months of the current financial year. TCS now needs more than $8.92 billion in revenue in second half of the year if it intends to grow at 7.1% this year. Simply put, TCS will need to record a better show in the October-March period this year than in the second half of last year. This certainly is a tall task as technology outsourcing firms report soft growth in the second half of the financial year.Undoubtedly, Chandrasekaran faces a tough task given the size of TCS.At the heart of TCSs slow growth is its inability to build a stronger consulting practice and reluctance to buy small firms for technologies like design consulting and automation platform providers. These tiny buyouts not just improve the current solution deliveries but also bring in growth. May be now, Mistry could nudge Chandrasekaran to start buying.With this as a backdrop, Mint puts the spotlight on five things to watch in TCSs second quarter earnings on 13 October:1. Revenue growthBrokerage BNP Paribas expects TCSs dollar revenue to rise 1.6% to $4.43 billion in the July-September period on a sequential basis. This is a big worry as this will mean that TCS needs to put forward its best foot forward in the remaining six months of the year if it wants to save itself from the humiliation of recording an even slower growth than last year. Management commentary on demand levels from its customers in Europe, after Britain voted to leave the EU, will be crucial.2. Pressure on profitability poses a double whammySince January this year, TCSs operating margins have been under pressure. TCSs 26.1% Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin at the end of March quarter was 54 basis points less than margins at the end of October-December period last year. The companys margins further contracted to 25.1% at the end of March quarter, which the management claimed to be largely on account of annual wage hikes. Now, as commoditized deals come under further pricing pressure, and TCS continues to spend money in reskilling its workforce and building digital technologies, traditional levers like going slow on hiring, will not be enough to offset the gradual decline in profitability. Analysts say that TCS is unlikely to end the current financial year with its stated guidance of 26-28%.3. What really is the problem among TCSs BFSI clients in the US?On 7 September, TCS in a mid-quarter update, said that some holding back of discretionary spending particularly in the BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance clients) vertical in the United States had led to sequential loss of momentum at the company. Is this just an one-off development or does this suggest a structural malaise? We know all IT vendors are seeing less business from big banks as these banks are spending less in application development work. Homegrown technology vendors are further seeing erosion in current revenue from the embrace of automation platforms, which is cannibalizing the existing model of billing clients on human hours. 4. Rain check of weak sectors and geographiesTCS does not expect growth to rebound in Japan. The company claims to have arrested any loss of business from its UK-based insurance platform Diligenta. Growth from telecoms segment continue to be wobbly. Together, an underperformance from the three units eroded about 2% growth from the companys 11.9% growth on constant currency basis in 2015-16. TCS needs to report some growth on a consistent basis if it has to better last years growth.5. Is higher net erosion of existing business biting into TCSs growth?During the July-September period last year, TCS claimed its order book was the strongest ever, with about 30% more than the company ever managed in any quarter. The company, however, does not disclose its order book size. Outsourcing deals are long-term contracts, and IT vendors can generate only about 3-4% of revenue from new orders in the first year, according to JPMorgan Chases George. Agreed, IT firms lose about 3-5% of current business every year, which in TCSs case, translates into a loss of about $500-825 million a year. This clearly suggest that TCS is losing more business from existing clients because even some business generated from its record order book has not offset the annual loss of business, thereby resulting in a sluggish y-o-y growth.",2016-10-12,hesaBaeP0eIEHrwSnqJO5K,TC is likely to report weak numbers in the second quarter and risks growing at a slower clip this year than last year,both,01:16,TCS Q2 earnings: Five things to watch for today
-0.74,"New Delhi: The practice of forcing industries to cross-subsidize household consumers power tariffs is leading to an unprecedented shift among businesses towards captive solar power with some committing to go fully reliant on clean energy.
				   
				Cost of producing solar power, which was over Rs12 per kilowatt hour (unit) in 2010, has dropped sharply over the years. The latest auction, which was held in November, saw takers for solar power projects willing to sell power at Rs3 a unit. The fall in solar power generation cost has now made it attractive for businesses to go for captive solar power plants, including rooftop plants that supply power cheaper than from the grid, which is expensive on account of the cross-subsidy that industrial consumers are saddled with. Businesses, especially in the manufacturing sector, have long been complaining of high cost of power, exorbitant tax on diesel and escalating cost of capital as factors that render them less competitive in global markets where their peers enjoy low or negative cost of capital and in some cases, subsidies. Solar power is now available at Rs 4-4.5 a unit. In the future, it will cost much less because of technology improvement and possibly low cost of capital. In West Bengal, for instance, cost of power from the grid for industries ranges from Rs 6-8 per unit at present. In Maharashtra, it is Rs 6.5 a unit. Everywhere, except two or three states, tariffs are above Rs 5 a unit for industrial consumers. If you are able to get concessional finance from any multilateral agency and you can produce solar power at Rs 4 a unit consistently for 25 years, it can reduce cost of energy for the business and reduce carbon emissions, said Mahendra Singhi, chief executive officer, Dalmia Cements (Bharat) Ltd. Dalmia Cementss short term goal is to raise the share of clean energy in its total electricity consumption fourfold from 7% at present and to go fully reliant on clean energy in the long term. Multilateral agencies such as International Finance Corp. (IFC), the private investment arm of World Bank Group, US Exim Bank, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Japan International Cooperation Agency and Germanys KFW are bullish on Indias rapidly expanding renewable energy industry for investment opportunities. We already have $1 billion of investments in clean energy projects in India. We are open to scaling it up to $3-4 billion in coming years, said Shalabh Tandon, India lead, climate business & clean energy, IFC. IFC on Thursday announced an equity investment of $125 million in Hero Future Energies Private Ltd., a clean energy firm, for a minority stake. Tandon said that IFC does not invest in coal-based thermal power because of its commitment to climate change goals. Companies like Apple Inc., IKEA Group, Nokia Oyj, Infosys Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd are among those committed to becoming fully reliant on clean energy.The Economic Survey 2015-16 had suggested that the burden of subsidising poor consumers can shift from industrial consumers to rich individuals and that state electricity regulators should use income as a yardstick to fix the power tariff for individual consumers. The idea was to help businesses become more competitive. India has a target of putting in place 175 gigawatt (GW) of renewable power capacity by 2022, out of which 100 GW is to come from solar. At the moment, the country has about 8.7 GW of solar power capacity.One hurdle that companies face in going fully reliant on clean energy is that storage of energy is a costly proposition, which makes them rely on stable power from the grid for a significant part of their energy consumption when renewable energy is not available. Singhi of Dalmia Cements said that once power storage becomes a viable option, the company will be fully run on clean energy.",2017-01-06,hjuezPVDJdbEbipsCKavSN,The fall in solar power generation cost has now made it attractive for businesses to go for captive solar power plants,competitor,14:37,Cross-subsidy of power tariffs lure businesses to solar energy

The stock therefore rose 5% on Monday but slipped a bit on Tuesday, even as it has outperformed the BSE Auto index in the last one year.
				   
				Fuelling growth were the nine new launches in the auto segment through fiscal year 2016 that pushed up sales by about 15% from a year ago. And the price hike helped to improve the average per vehicle revenue by about 4%. However, it was not so in the farm equipment segment, where volumes grew by only 5% year-on-year and the revenue per unit sold fell by 1.7%.True, a weak rabi crop after two consecutive weak monsoons has dried up demand for farm equipment. Yet, as the market leader in tractors, M&Ms market share rose by about 300 basis points to 43% during the quarter. Its small commercial vehicles did not do too well. A basis point is 0.01%.Put together, net revenue (M&M and Mahindra Vehicle Manufacturers Ltd) rose by 15%. But what enthused investors was the 250 basis points jump in operating margin, at a time when sales growth is not at its best. Analysts feel that one-offs impacted profitability. An Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd report says that provisioning in line with the new Bonus Act, value diminution of assets and revaluation of loans impacted profit margins for the quarter. Of course, the biggest relief was the lower raw material costs and efforts to trim vehicle inventory. But this is no reason for bullishness on the companys prospects. The forthcoming monsoon is critical in determining offtake of farm equipment and automobiles. M&Ms management has pulled down its guidance for the former in FY16 from 5% to 10% and this segment comprises a third of the consolidated revenue.That said, the year after may see a better growth rate given the low base, and support an expansion in valuation. At present, the M&M stock trades at 10 times one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple. Given the estimated growth of 15% in annual earnings over the next two years, the stock does not seem expensive.",2016-02-17,hqLdPyazZIzwFKA1sMbJsJ,"Fuelling growth were the nine new launches in the auto segment through fiscal year 2016 that pushed up sales by about 15% from a year ago

-0.51,"Amid a weak business environment, herbicides remain a bright spot for agrochemical firms. The herbicides business, which has been outperforming the agrochemical market growth for the past several years, is forecast to grow at strong pace in the next few years too.
				   
				Manpower shortage and high agricultural wages are driving demand for herbicides. Historically, the availability of an abundance of low-cost workers meant there wasnt much of a need for herbicides, as the work of uprooting the unwanted plants could be done manually. But as wages rose, manual weeding has become an expensive affair, which in turn is driving demand for herbicides.According to Avendus Capital Pvt. Ltd, in the five years to 2014, the herbicides market expanded at an average annual pace of 15%, faster than the 10-13% growth registered by insecticides and fungicides. Insecticides are used to kill insects, while fungicides destroy fungi. The total agrochemical market is estimated to grow by 12% per annum.Avendus Capital forecasts the insecticides and fungicides market growth to moderate to 10-12% in 2014-2019. But herbicides are expected to maintain the growth tempo. From $900 million in 2014 the herbicides market is estimated to double to $1.8 billion in 2019. This trend is expected to continue going forward, with strengthening demand arising for herbicides from increased mechanization and reduced labour intensity of agricultural practices, higher labour cost arising from urbanization and reduction in rural population, Avendus Capital said in a note.Not surprisingly, companies are realigning their product portfolios to capture the strong growth in herbicides. Five of the 20 new products Bayer CropScience Ltd is planning to launch by 2020 are in the herbicides category. The company aims to increase the contribution of revenue from herbicides from 17% now to 40% by 2020, Edelweiss Securities Ltd said in a note.According to B&K Securities India Pvt. Ltd, Rallis India Ltd has launched two new herbicides in the first half of the current fiscal year. The company is expected to ramp up these products in the coming season. Similarly, Dhanuka Agritech Ltd launched three herbicides in the last two years. The product for sugarcane received good response and the company expects sales to pick up in the coming year.India is catching up with the global trends in agrochemical usage. World over, herbicides constitute around 45% of the agrochemicals market, compared with 16% in India, points out Avendus Capital.But due to the reasons cited earlier, and an increased focus on horticulture crops, the market for herbicides is growing at a strong pace. While this should please industry participants, other factors like agricultural produce prices and farm profitability will also have a bearing on demand.",2016-03-24,hyZ3QuNGzpSgPo5BXoqeIO,"Manpower shortage and high agricultural wages are driving demand for herbicides

0.66,"Uber Technologies Inc. said on Thursday that it would not withdraw its ride-sharing services, deemed illegal by the Karnataka transport department, in Bengaluru.
				   
				The company has also floated a public petition to garner support for ride-sharing, anticipating an imminent crackdown from the transport department.As we believe that UberPOOL is within the law, right now there is no push to stop the product.We have always said that ride share is something that is very much welcome for a city like Bengaluru, said Christian Freese, general manager, Uber, Bengaluru.State transport commissioner M.K.Aiyappa had given both Uber and Ola (ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd) time until Friday to withdraw their respective ride-sharing services, UberPOOL and Ola Share.According to the transport department, the ride-hailing firms have contract carriage permits, which do not allow them to pick up and drop passengers during the course of a trip. Such a permit only allows for point-to-point pick-ups and drops.The stage carriage permit, which allows pick ups and drops along a particular route, can only be accorded to Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation and school and college buses, according to the transport department.UberPOOL is a product that enables driver partners to pick up and drop identified riders through the Uber app under a single contract. When a rider chooses UberPOOL through the Uber app, he or she consents to another person sharing the trip. There is a clear understanding between all the riders on the trip and the driver partner that the trip and the vehicle will be shared. The app also identifies all the riders and the driver partner, said an Uber spokesperson.The law permits a contract carriage permit-holder to stop to pick up or set down passengers who are included in the contractual understanding with the driver. UberPOOL fulfils this requirement and we believe that it does not violate the contract carriage permit, the spokesperson said.An Ola spokesperson did not immediately respond to a query on whether the company will stop Ola Share from Friday. Several company executives who declined to be named confirmed Ola has no plans to stop ride-sharing either.Continuing the service might lead to a crackdown by the transport department, said Aiyappa.The withdrawal of ride-sharing services is likely to impact the businesses of both firms, given that Bengaluru is one of their top three markets, alongside Delhi and Mumbai. Of late, both Ola and Uber have been aggressively promoting ride-sharing facilities.Freese said Bengaluru is the fifth-largest market for UberPOOL, with about one-fourth of all the trips fulfilled by Uber in Bengaluru being POOL rides. Freese did not disclose the number of rides completed by Uber in Bengaluru daily, but said more than one million consumers in the city have used POOL at least once.The state transport department had forced shuttle service provider ZipGo to halt operations in Bengaluru in December 2015 on similar grounds. The regulator said there was no provision in the Karnataka Motor Vehicle Rules of 1989 for services that compete with state-run city buses. Similarly, bike taxis launched by Ola and Uber were deemed illegal by the Karnataka government. Both companies withdrew the services within a month of launch in March 2016.Uber and SoftBank-backed Ola have struggled to comply with regulations, which the firms have contended need to be updated to accommodate new-generation products.States such as Maharashtra and Karnataka, among others, have come up with guidelines to regulate these services after protests by traditional taxi operators.",2017-02-02,hzFDkU3qDYI1KmDxt2gDRP,Uber has floated a public petition to garner support its ride-sharing service UberPool  in Bengaluru in the wake of an imminent crackdown from the Karnataka transport dept,competitor,15:28,Uber says wont withdraw UberPOOL in Bengaluru as ban looms
-0.92,"The flock of frightened pigeons that calls itself Indias telecom industry had a violent reaction recently when their regulator set a cat among them.
				   
				The impending entry of a new fourth-generation operator would anyway mean a trip to the slaughterhouse for a few of the dozen existing players, some of whom are already making a run for the coop door. But thats a known risk. Its the threat of having to cede market share to billionaire Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Jio faster than imagined thats causing nervousness.That latter possibility has been raised by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of Indias (Trai) consultation paper on scrapping the compensation one wireless service receives for calls routed to it by another.That proposal to do away with the calling-party-pays system, the incumbents allege, smacks of bias. It would give a pricing advantage to a new network like Jio, which would be more likely to originate calls than terminate them. Meanwhile, Jio has complained that existing operators are sabotaging its ongoing beta trials by not offering adequate interconnection, leading to call drops.Incumbents have denied the allegation, and accused Ambani of running a service in the garb of testing. The dispute is fast turning into just the kind of melee the government, looking to hold its biggest-ever auction of spectrum a little more than a month from now, can ill afford.Also Read: Reliance Jio vs the rest: Trai, PMO dragged into the fightTo the extent the fracas is the harbinger of a bruising price war, its also bad news for shareholders of Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular, which together with Vodafone control more than three-fifths of the market. The quest to expand data usage on their networks ahead of Jios long-delayed entry has already caused prices to head south:While data usage is indeed picking up, capital expenditure is accelerating. Ideas net debt is almost 5.7 times annual earnings before interest and taxes (Ebit); its 3.3 times Ebit for Bharti. With Reliance boasting to the regulator that its $20 billion investment in Jio is already more than any of its competitors, incumbents have little breathing room.When Kumar Mangalam Birla, Idea Cellulars controlling shareholder, sought to streamline his fiber-to-finance empire, minority shareholders balked at the prospect of being asked to fund his money-guzzling telecom venture. Ambani, on the other hand, has been lucky. His petroleum-refining business is minting cash, so creditors are giving him the chips to spin the roulette wheel and grab those 100 million Reliance Jio subscribers he craves.The stakes are high, and so are anxiety levels. With the regulator adding to the uncertainty about future market share, investors can expect more volatility. Idea Cellulars shares jumped as much as 7.9% on Tuesday before the company said media speculation about a sale to Vodafone is untrue and preposterous.The fluttering has begun.

0.67,"Singapore/Seoul: Lee Jae-yong, the crown prince of the founding family that controls Samsung Group, is getting expanded corporate power. Now comes the guessing game about what hell do with it.
				   
				On Thursday, Lee officially joined a nine-person board at Samsung Electronics Co., whose botched roll out of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone has delivered a blow to a premier tech brand and cost the company billions of dollars in profit. The move gives the low-profile executive, also known as Jay Y., a big say over top management and strategic calls, including restructurings, mergers and asset sales.His ascension comes on the same day that Samsung reported a sharp decline in profits, as the recall took its toll. Net income fell to 4.41 trillion won ($3.9 billion) in the September quarter; the debacle that may ultimately cost more than $6 billion. Shares in the company rose 0.4% at the close of trade in Seoul.Lee, 48, is already vice chairman of Samsung Electronics and has gained influence since his father, Lee Kun-hee, suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized in 2014. The founding family controls Samsung Group, whose tentacles extend into financial services, hotels, biopharmaceuticals and fashion, through a complex network of cross ownership. So in a way, Lees elevation to the board of the flagship will be something akin to a coronation.We can now say that Lees regime has officially begun, said Lee Chaiwon, chief investment officer at Korea Value Asset Management Co. I think a new era is coming. Lee believes Jay Y.s enhanced influence will be an adrenaline shot for a company in crisis. The company will become more market-friendly, he said, predicting the new board member will quicken its restructuring process.Samsung Electronics has no shortage of challenges, urgent ones. In addition to mopping up after the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, the younger Lee faces a threat from activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. thats pushing Samsung Electronics to simplify its ownership structure. The New York-based fund, founded by stock picker Paul Singer, also wants the company to add independent directors and dish out a special $27 billion dividend to investors.Being a board member means management responsibility, said Heo Pil-seok, chief executive officer of Midas International Asset Management Co. The market will expect Lee to come up with some follow-up steps to settle the Note 7 problem.Samsungs management and board are carefully reviewing all of Elliotts proposals, senior vice-president Robert Yi told a conference call. After buying back more than 11 trillion won of stock since last year, the Suwon-based company plans to shed more light on its shareholder return policy next month, he said.While about 400 investors attended the meeting to vote on Jay Y.s appointment, the man himself wasnt there. Instead it was vice chairman Kwon Oh-hyun and co-chief executive officer Shin Jong-kyun who spoke about the crisis and management shortcomings.Shin said the number of incidents with the Note 7 was in the hundreds and Samsung was continuing to investigate as it revisits every aspect of its hardware, software and production processes.It is not acceptable that we did not meet our own quality assurance standards, said Shin, a former head of the phone business. We know we must work hard to earn back your trust and we are committed to doing just that.Then theres the broader sales slump at Samsung Electronics, which also makes semiconductors and display panels. The company is coping with a drop in LCD panel prices and lower-cost Chinese rivals in the television market. Total third-quarter sales fell to 47.8 trillion won and the company could record its third straight year of decelerating annual revenue, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. For the coming year, Samsung said its planning to spend a record 27 trillion won on plants and equipment as it boosts production of OLED displays.What Samsung needs the most now is the total shake-up of its system and personnel in order to refresh its collapsed brand image following the Note 7 crisis, said Chung Sun-sup, CEO of corporate research firm Chaebul.com. He sees Lees influence being felt across the entire Samsung empire, starting with groups annual management shake-up at the end of the year. He will legally play a lead role in the groups key affairs, including making big deals, personnel reshuffle and other financial agendas, he said.Owing to South Koreas tradition of filial piety, its been difficult for the younger Lee to take command since his father fell ill. That said, Lee attracted media attention in 2015 when he apologized on live television for a Samsung-owned hospitals failure to contain a Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome.Franz-Hermann Hirlinger, the first foreign outside director ever to serve at Samsung Electronics, remembers Lee as a young man who always sat in a corner with his back straight and hands neatly folded on his knees, quietly observing board meetings. Everyone in the room, including Hirlinger, knew that it was part of his training to succeed his father one day.That day has arrived. And Lee is already drawing criticism. Sustinvest Inc., a Seoul-based proxy-advisory firm, said in a letter to shareholders this week that Lee isnt qualified to be on the board because he benefited from inter-affiliate transactions at the Samsung group.There is a widespread expectation for vice chairman Lee to show that he is able to take charge and lead Samsung out of the crisis and usher in change, said Kim Sang-jo, a professor at Hansung University.People who have worked closely with Jay Y. describe him as a polar opposite of his larger-than-life father. The younger Lee is an affable, approachable man with a global view, who wants to modernize South Koreas largest business group, according to Hirlinger.In his new and expanded role, Lees performance will come under even greater scrutiny. Until now, Lee could just enjoy the good times and avoid the bad times and didnt have to take any legal responsibilities, said Chung with Chaebul.com. But if things like the Note 7 happens again, he said, many fingers will point at him. Bloomberg",2016-10-27,iCeczLlNyM59tEfmNqRosK,"Lee Jae-yong, 48, is already vice chairman of Samsung Electronics and has gained influence since his father, Lee Kun-hee, suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized in 2014",competitor,16:02,Samsung scion Lee Jae-yong begins reign amid Galaxy Note 7 smartphone crisis

0.64,"Mumbai:  I woke up early on Thursday morning and got dressed quickly to get out and convert the sole Rs500 currency note in my wallet. Typically, we journalists dont carry a lot of cash in wallets (not that our bank accounts have much either). Banks were opening after a days break and India had seen the largest currency withdrawal programme in nearly 40 years, and a moderate to large crowd was certainly expected. But then it was just one note, how long would it take to exchange? I thought while clearly underestimating the average Indians need to be first in a queue.
				   
				I thought of visiting the closest bank branch I could find in Bandra West. A sole Greater Bombay Cooperative Bank branch gave me some hope. I could see some people waiting for the bank to open so that they may feel rich again. As soon as the branch started its operations, I could see eager customers in the queue look spiffy, only to see the branch staff come out and tell them that they had not received any new currency notes and they did not have a ny new notes. The notes would only arrive after  4pm.  Six hours for a lousy Rs 500 currency note? Whats this, the iPhone 7? I muttered under my breath while angrily kicking the ground.Maybe the branch of a bigger bank might be a good idea, I thought to myself, carefully caressing the Rs500 note in my hand. I walked up to an Axis Bank branch nearby, only to find out that the staff had run out of Rs100 currency notes in the first couple of hours. The staff told all of us to come back by tomorrow to get the new Rs500 and Rs 2,000 currency notes. Maybe a public sector bank will be more amenable to my needs and ensure that I have enough liquidity to last the day before the automated teller machines (ATMs) start working from Friday. I got into an autorickshaw and asked the driver to drop me at a bank branch. Any bank branch would do, I said to myself. An Allahabad Bank branch on Pali Hill Road was the closest we could find. So I walked up to the gate, which was teeming with people at the door. Apparently they wanted my original identity proof and self-attested photocopy to ensure that my money is converted into an acceptable currency over which I shall have ownership rights again. However, I quickly moved to the neighbouring private bank ICICI Bank, thinking the documentation system would be much easier. ICICI Bank, I thought, would have a more streamlined process where the authorities wouldnt want me to give them a hundred different documents. Of course, I forgot that this withdrawal of currency was a government initiative, so every possible box for paperwork has been ticked.Besides, I had lost my old wallet only recently and all of my original government identity proofs were gone though I had the photo copies of them. The Rs500 note in my wallet was staring back at me with disdain, even as I tried to look for a way to get rid of it.The staff at the ICICI Bank branch was considerate enough to come and tell me that there was no rush to come and convert my money to the new currency on Thursday. And, I could come back anytime later in the week. Of course, I didnt tell her about my lost identity proofs, but it felt good that these options were readily available for some more time.

0.05,"Bengaluru: It has been a little over 15 months since R. Seshasayee became the non-executive chairman of Infosys Ltd. His term coincides with a very interesting time for the company, which is trying to regain its tag as the bellwether of the Indian IT industry under its first non-founder chief executive, Vishal Sikka.
				   
				In an interview, Seshasayee explained his equation with Sikka, the changing role of the board, the challenges it faces, its relationship with the company founders, what he likes about Sikkas leadership style and why it is wrong to say that Infosys has twin power structures. Edited excerpts:Is Infosys in a better shape now than when you started in this role?Firstly, the change at the leadership level, to have someone like Vishal (Sikka) come (in), has (given) a very clear strategic direction to the company, given the changing landscape in the industry. That is a very big step forward.From the boards perspective, it is very important to have the right leader, and I believe we have the right leader. From the boards perspective, it is important that the leader articulates the strategy (and) the board is aligned to this strategy. I can categorically say that the board is fully aligned to this strategy Vishal has sketched.I and the board feel extremely good that this strategic change in direction to meet the new demands in the business landscape has gone down very well. To communicate this kind of a change in an organization that is as large as Infosys is not easy.Now, of course we have the execution challenges. And those are things which we will learn as we go along. We have had a few bumps. We have had some quick learning. I think, by and large, the strategy is getting executed with the right speed and in the right direction. What is the boards role in designing this strategy?Ideally, the board should pick the right leader for the company and the leader should articulate the strategy. The board has an active role to play for sure in understanding the strategic proposal, challenging that, and getting an alignment between the management and the board. The board cannot stand aside and say that all this is strategic direction and not our problem. The board has to be fully engaged in (the) formulation of strategy.We have had in the last couple of years a pretty deep level of engagement. The board does not meet only for board meetings for approving what is put on the table. So the engagement has been continuous. It has not been even that it takes place (just) once a quarter.The second is that I also think that it is important to think for the board to be learning. Learning is an important DNA of Infosys. Learning does not just apply to executives, the rank and file of management. It equally applies to members of the board. We have had systematic immersion sessions. And our intent is to intensify these sessions. Intent is to make sure that we are not merely sitting and listening in these sessions.This is a journey. It is never-ending. But I do think both these continuous engagement and continuous learning are making it possible to have a very constructive dialogue with the leadership. What are the big challenges faced by the board?I cannot think of a company of this size which has gone through transformation simultaneously on three fronts. The first is the business transformation. All IT firms are going through this, simply because (their) clients are going through this transformation. That is one massive transformation. That is pervasive and happening all across.The second is the move from (being) an iconic promoter-led organization to an organization that is professionally managed at the management and board level. I was actually looking at how many top 100 companies in India have entirely professional board and professional management. If you leave aside the banks and the public sector undertakings, perhaps Infosys is the only company. From a governance construct, this is a very unique and desirable construct, one which would be the ideal construct. But this transformation from a promoter-managed organization to a professional-managed organization both happening at the same time, is a huge transformation. Actually the average tenure of the board, if I leave aside Jeff (Professor Jeffrey Lehman), is two-and-a-half years. So you have a completely new set of people.And so, to be able to navigate this huge company in the right direction, from the point of view of both strategic (issues) and governance, that requires a great deal of work, and a great deal of rescripting of the playbook.We have had challenges in the first quarter. We have had some challenges (with) a couple of good leaders, whom we would have liked to retain, not being there. We have had some challenges regarding the perception issue into governance. I dont think these are real issues but perception issues. But we have very quickly learnt and we are putting in very quickly in place the right kind of solutions. That is the second kind of transformation which we are scripting very well.And then there is the third kind of transformation which is the cultural transformation. From a company that had been pretty much India-centric, we are truly now global-minded. This is a cultural shift. So, in some sense, we need to reset the needle. Each of these transformations is itself a challenge. It may not be apparent to someone on the outside. There is some criticism that Infosyss board does not have enough people with a technology background. Im hearing this for the first time that we do not have enough people from tech background on the board. We have Vishal and (chief operating officer) Pravin (Rao).Beyond Vishal and Pravin?Let me explain the diversity we have on the board. We have Ravi (Venkatesan), who has spent years in technology at Microsoft. Of course, we have Roopa (Kudva) and Punita (Kumar-Sinha). Look at their background. They have not been only in one industry. Roopa has spent a lifetime at a variety of industries, evaluating, assessing, rating a variety of industries. And so has Punita. We have people dealing with different firms, including technology firms. Then we have people like Jeff and John (Etchemendy) who bring the academic discipline to it. Kiran (Mazumdar-Shaw) is a very entrepreneurial person. We have a very good diverse group of people. Having said that, we are constantly on the lookout for the right kind of talent. We are pretty much looking at every possible skill where we think we have a gap and which we think we need to bring in. So we are looking at people. So that is a continuous process. We have people on the board who can read the future, have good understanding of technology trends, are able to challenge the strategic direction. We do take external inputs where we need. So those people dont have to be on the board.So could you perhaps expand the board?We are on the lookout, and we have some candidates in mind and we will do it at the right time.Help us understand the boards relationship with the company founders.So this iconic institution has been created by an iconic leader (N.R. Narayana) Murthy and his wonderful team. This is an outstanding or exceptional kind of history where Murthy and team decided to step down or step away. I must tell you categorically that while I have personally a lot of communication happening with Murthy, not once even by accident have the promoters asked for information which is not available to the public. That must be said to the credit of the promoters that they have not sought any information which would give them any preferential access to any information.We talk about many things. We talk about perceptions that you might have from what is available in the public domain, about the kind of strategic direction. And I take his advice very seriously. But that said, the board has the responsibility to do what is right for the institution. The board is closest to the facts and the situation on the ground.And therefore, information and facts, which are available to the board must drive the board in the right direction, and that decision will be of the board only. Do you think the founders could have expressed their unhappiness with certain board decisions such as Sikkas compensation or Kumar-Sinhas appointment differently?This is a question that should not be asked to me, since this is what the promoters chose to do; so it will not be fair for me to respond. From the boards perspective, we have advice coming from many other investors and not just the promoters. If you believe we do not have discussions with any other investors, you are wrong. The conversations we have with the promoters are no different than those we have with other investors. So it is not right for me to be second-guessing on what they should do. Were you a little saddened by the way they expressed their displeasure?This is a free world and everybody has their own viewpoint. So, do I get saddened by the percentage of negative votes on anything? No. I have a job to do, and we have some 99 percentage in favour and that is a resounding endorsement of the boards recommendation. We should just move on. What issues do you seek their advice on? There are many issues on which I seek advice from many people. So why would you want to only look at what Im seeking from Mr Murthy. Murthy has been a friend for 30 years. We have worked together on boards. We were together on the board of ICICI, we have worked together on many other forums. So he is one person I respect, like other people. So I dont see anything unusual in that. There is this perception that there are twin power centres at Infosys: Murthy and Sikka.First, there is no such twin power centres. That is completely wrong, and that will be very unfair to the promoters. Because, like I mentioned, Murthy has been an exceptional leader who has chosen to stay away and only give advice when sought from. So it will be utterly wrong. Now, the second thing is that when you say there is this perception. Now I dont want to deal with perceptions. We must deal with reality. Im dealing with reality. The reality is that what I have clearly said.What are the issues on which Sikka seeks your advice?Because of the fact that we have a very unique construct, the engagement of the board (with Sikka) has been continuous. My engagement with Vishal has been more intense than the rest of the board. I think we speak almost every week, sometimes multiple times a week. We discuss different issues, say related to people, organization, performance, relating to issues on strategy, customers. We discuss also spirituality and philosophy on weekends. We have an excellent rapport and relationship. We have a lot of common interests. Last night, we were talking on pure sciences. So, the foundation of the relationship is one of complete mutual trust, and complete transparent sharing of information and views. So there are many things that we do.How is the board helping Sikka in this transformation? Its a two-way constructive process. Its not on the basis of a paper that is put on the table. The way it is being done is through continuous, comprehensive and concerted engagement.What is the toughest issue you have advised him on so far?The toughest discussions we have had are on philosophy.Is Vishals compensation of $11 million a year linked to Infosys clocking $20 billion by March 2021?The compensation is linked to targets which are publically given. There is a trajectory for this. The compensation is linked to that trajectory. This is something which the board and Vishal have discussed and agreed.Can you help us understand the weightage of the three specific targets (total revenue, revenue per employee, operating margin) on Sikkas variable pay?There is probably no other Indian company which has so clearly linked pay to targets which have been made public. To my mind, this is the most transparent way of getting shareholders approval. In the trajectory, we have to take into account many things. We need to take into account the industry dynamics, the company dynamics, the people dynamics, all of that. Thats something which the board is charged with the responsibility to do and we will do so.Can you give us some details about the trajectory itself?Can you tell me another company that has been giving the targets for the compensation of the chief executive? There is good reason why no other company does this. It is not because this is inconvenient or anything. It is because, as I said, its a very dynamic situation. Every month, we see changes in the landscape. Every month, we see new challenges. The board is a delegated authority of the shareholders to run this company. It is therefore in the fitness of things that the board does the job that has been entrusted by the shareholders. It doesnt kick back to the shareholders the job that has been entrusted. We have gone one step further to say, yes this long-term goal is what we believe must be the reference point for the compensation.So is it more aspirational in nature?No, I have said that there is nothing aspirational in this. This is a target which the company is looking at, is pursuing. Now nothing is cast in stone. But this is, at the moment, the target that we have.Are you saying that the growth of the industry will also be taken into account?The growth of the industry is pretty much the playfield, right? So we have got to look at the growth of the industry in the context of assessment.(For any company,) the target is fixed for the annual budget in the context of what you see is the market situation. Technology changes, all of it are taken into account. A five-year goal is fixed on what you believe is the kind of the trajectory in this. We have to keep constantly calibrating both the environment and the industry. As of now, we are not changing those targets (for Infosys).Can they be changed?Thats a speculative question. Why did the board change its original plan on the promised payment to former chief financial officer Rajiv Bansal?All I can say is I have already made the statement suo motu in the AGM (annual general meeting). You wrote this article (referring to Mints story in May on Bansals unusually high severance pay). Because you wrote this article, I thought it is important and it is our responsibility to make sure that we address this issue. So the issue was not raised in the AGM, but I made a suo motu statement saying that we believe that there is no impropriety.There is a severance agreement. There are rights of the parties in the contract. And the contract will be administrated in line with the rights of the parties. Period. That is all. So has there been any change in the agreement?That is not something you need to be looking at all. I am only saying there is a contract, (there are) the rights of the parties in the contract and the contract will be administered in line with the contractual rights of the parties. Period.So is it fair to assume that you could rework it if one of the parties did not abide by its terms?This is an entirely legal issue. All I need to say is that there are no other extraneous considerations for this, for the administration of this. It will be driven by the contractual rights. Has anything happened within the realms of that contract that could lead to a change in it?No matter where you are coming from, the only two things which are relevant to the public and relevant to everybody else (are): Is this an issue where there is impropriety? I have said no, repeatedly no, and I stand by that.Is this contract getting changed or cancelled for any other extraneous considerations? I am going a step further to say: The contract will be administered based on the rights of the parties in the contract. Period.How do you like Sikkas leadership style?We have the right kind of leader in Vishal. His understanding of the changes, his insight into the changes is outstanding. Vishals articulation of a solution, even in the context of the auto industry for example or the banking industry, is absolutely on the dot. We have a very good leader who understands client requirements and his client connect is exceptional. His strategic direction is exceptional. He has been a phenomenal person to motivate a very, very large crowd. Its not easy for a new person to step in and have this kind of influence. We certainly have an exceptional leader.How has the boards role at a company changed?The role of a board has changed phenomenally, and for the good. It is no longer this friends club that you had in the past and people coming to have a cup of coffee and go back. This is the trusteeship concept. That is getting to be far better understood now by enlightened boards, and therefore, the responsibility that comes with that. In the process, the engagement is getting to be much more. Increasingly, I find that the board meeting is just one punctuation mark in that engagement. It also brings in the need for a greater amount of understanding of the business and the independence to challenge.

				The companys late Friday revelation that the global craze for chasing imaginary creatures with a smartphone wont be a huge earnings driver confirms what many had suspected, but which the stock had not yet reflected. That changed Monday with Nintendo falling by its 18% limit in early Tokyo trading. The plunge left the shares 73% higher than a month ago, before Pokemon Go was unleashed.Also read: Behavioural science and Pokémon GoTo put that move in context, the massive run-up leaves Nintendo only 42% higher for the year to date and just 15% up on 12 months ago. In other words, Pokemon Go may have driven the stock, but a lot of that gain has been recovering lost ground over the past year.But theres an even more important issue to consider here. Why isnt a top app-store ranking, incessant media coverage and sponsorship deals with fast-food restaurants turning into a windfall for Nintendo?The company itself outlined one of the reasons in its statement last week. Pokemon Go isnt developed or distributed by Nintendo, but by Niantic, a spinoff from AlphabetGoogles parent company. Pokemon itself is owned by The Pokemon Co., of which Nintendo only owns 32%, and The Pokemon Co. gets a licensing fee and compensation for collaboration in developing Pokemon Go. So any earnings from Pokemon Go make their way to The Pokemon Co. through a filtered process, details of which arent public. Nintendo only gets to recognize its portion of those profits through the equity method of accounting.Hence Nintendos headline statement: Because of this accounting scheme, the income reflected on the companys consolidated business results is limited. It also means that movie rights, fast-food deals and any other spinoffs Pokemon Go inspires only get to Nintendo through The Pokemon Co.All of this would have been taken into account when Nintendo laid out on 27 April its forecast for the 12 months to 31 March 2017 . The fact that it said on Friday that its not modifying the consolidated financial forecast for now indicates how underwhelming the upside is from the Pokemeon Go craze and why investors are right to finally start questioning it.If The Pokemon Co. has done a poor job of extracting more from the likes of McDonalds amid the Go craze, then theres not a lot Nintendo can do about it.To further rain on Pokemon Gos parade, investors need also to understand that a hit game does not a windfall profit make. The app, and thus the game, are free and free is a very low barrier to getting users to download it to their smartphonesespecially when every media outlet in the world is hyping it as a phenomenon.Also read: How Pokemon Go went from Google prank to Nintendo phenomenonThe revenue model is in-app purchases of items that could help players improve their scores. Pokemon Gos conversion rates, which track dollars per user or how many users buy items, arent yet publicly available, and may never be made so. One estimate puts the conversion at about $1 per download so far, which is actually quite good but falls far short of justifying Nintendos share-price runup.What Nintendo really needs is for Niantic to find a way to extract even more money per user, and for The Pokemon Co. to get more cash out of the characters before the phenomenon dies down.Choosing not to raise its outlook amid the craze indicates that Nintendo may have trouble doing either, and thats a bad omen for its hopes of repeating this hit.We already know Pokemon Gos success is about as big as any augmented-reality and mobile-app spinoff is ever likely to get. In that light, dont bet on Mario, Luigi or Donkey Kong beating Pikachu to the profits.

The 47-year-old licensed pilot is unruffled by the much-talked-about emergence of Patanjali as a competitor to Dabur. Burman says his focus is to build Dabur as the multinational from India. Edited excerpts:
How big a threat is Patanjali?Besides that fact that you cant fight faith in India, I see Patanjali as an opportunity builder rather than a threat. Ramdev and Patanjali have expanded the market, turned a lot of non-users to users of Ayurvedic products. We have been selling Ayurvedic and natural products for more than 130 years. Our products are based on scientific research based on old Ayurvedic knowledge. We have the advantage. With time, more people will turn to science-based Ayurveda from faith-based Ayurveda. Innovation and efficient communication will definitely help us in staying ahead in the curve.But it has impacted Dabur. Except honey, there has not been much impact. We have taken some steps to address this, and sales of honey have already picked up. Overall growth, primarily in the past couple of quarters, was impacted due to many reasons, such as slowdown in rural markets.With the good monsoon, coupled with government initiatives, things should get better in the coming quarters.At Dabur, I involve in strategy, and expansion in new markets. Our aim is to make Dabur a multinational from India. Thats the long-term goal we have been working on.What are the things you would like to change if you were to run Dabur?Hunger for acquisitions should grow. Theres a limit on how much you can grow organically. Mergers and acquisitions are the route for faster growth. But that does not mean you can go for overpriced buys. The focus on international markets should increase. Markets outside of India should contribute more to overall sales. The third thing is the focus should be on healthcare. This is one area that would be very big in future. Everything, even food, should have a health focus. These are not new areas but enhanced focus on these will ensure faster growth.Market analysts have indicated a potential change in management. Will there be more involvement of the family in Daburs day-to-day operations?No. There is no plan of changing the management.

				At a panel discussion at the 10th Mint Annual Banking Conclave held in Mumbai on 23 January, bankers came together to discuss the  impact of going cashless on financial inclusion. Cashless transactions and financial inclusion are contradictory. If you are talking of cashless transactions, it will lead to financial exclusion, not lead to financial inclusion. You cannot have cashless financial transactions anywhere in the world and if it happens poor will suffer. Even in developed markets, the poor do financial transactions through cash, said K.C. Chakrabarty, a former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India. Chakrabarty, who had steered the financial inclusion drive at the central bank, says cash is the only payment mode  that ensures 100% penetration at low cost. Rajiv Lall, founder, managing director (MD) and chief executive officer (CEO) of IDFC Bank, however, believes that a technology-enabled payments service could be the answer to mass banking. Citing the example of Paytm, Lall said that payments are becoming an important service and the first point of contact with the customer in order to build a banking relationship. However, he was quick to add that cash still remains the most convenient way of doing transactions.Jiji Mammen, CEO of Mudra Bank, also concurred that cashless economy is the need of the hour. The segment which is at the bottom of the pyramid only deals in cash. Because of that we dont have transactional history of the person. Banks find it difficult to provide loan to persons at the bottom of the pyramid because there is no data available about them. If you go into digital mode, of course it will take time, over a period of time everyone will come on board, he said. But Chandra Shekhar Ghosh, MD and CEO of Bandhan Bank, is of the view that the shift to digital will not happen overnight.  When I started 16 years ago, microcredit to offer loan, that time also it was not readily accepted and I was questioned why the loan is given in a simple way, bank is not giving in a simple way, what is your intention. Now when we are going with new things, they are also asking a lot of questions on that. Down the line, they will understand and this money will be safe in bank accounts. The maximum number of MFI (microfinance) customers are women but their children are open to digital transactions, said Ghosh.At a time when most banks are testing different technologies independently or with the help of fintech companies to lure customers, mobile banking by way of smartphones is emerging as the most preferred mode of transaction. According to Samit Ghosh, MD and CEO of Ujjivan Financial Services Ltd, smartphones are the ultimate end of the cashless journey. For the time being Ghosh says he believes that the presence of bricks-and-mortar branches helps to build the trust among people. We had done a research with our segment of customers, trust is very important in banking. To see a bricks and mortar, even if they dont come there or even if they transact in handheld devices, is very important. Till a certain stage to build that trust, you have to have bricks and mortar, he added. But majority of bankers agree that the proportion of cash will come down in the system, albeit gradually. I expect 30-40% reduction in cash and the cash-to-GDP to fall from  10% to 6-7% by 2020, said V.S. Radhakrishnan, MD and CEO of Janalakshmi Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. Having said that, Radhakrishnan says he believes that smartphone banking is not going to pick up as long as digital costs remains high. Its not digital transactions alone that will drive financial inclusion. According to Jaspal Bindra, executive chairman of Centrum Group, banks still consider financial inclusion as an obligation and not as an objective and there needs to be a change in mindset.",2017-01-30,iVi36s7mEwuLPZ1Q2neqEN,"At a panel discussion at the 10th Mint Annual Banking Conclave in Mumbai, bankers weigh the  impact of going cashless on financial inclusion",competitor,02:20,Mint Annual Banking Conclave: Impact of going cashless on financial inclusion

				Voice revenues grew 3.8% and 4.6% year-on-year, respectively, for Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd, and declined by 0.9% for Vodafone India Ltd.But worse still, growth in data revenue decelerated further. As the chart alongside shows, growth in data revenue fell to 35% and 27%, respectively, for Bharti and Idea, from as high as 70-80% just a year ago.In fact, in the June quarter, Idea and Vodafone slowed investments on their networks considerably, which is perhaps an indication that the data opportunity is not as big as was earlier thought.Idea added close to 6,500 3G + 4G sites (in Q1), compared with 17,000 in the previous quarter. Vodafones site additions also slowed to 6,000 3G + 4G sites as compared with 15,000 in Q4. Ideas and Vodafones lower rollout numbers are largely a reflection of the relatively limited spectrum portfolio, especially in 4G. However, it might also be an indication of their view on the market, where both companies have been relatively conservative, compared with Bharti, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities wrote in a note to clients.Ideas voice volumes and revenue grew at a sedate pace as the company attempted to curb promotions. Since the move has backfired, it can be expected to be flexible with pricing to drive growth from Q2 onwards.In any case, industry dynamics have changed considerably since Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd launched operations in September. While data tariffs were anyway expected to be under pressure, Jio has also targeted the voice segment by offering unlimited voice calls at fairly low tariffs.The full impact of the Jio launch on average realizations and the growth metrics of incumbents will be visible only next year; but, its likely that some impact of additional promotions may be visible this year itself, especially in the December quarter.",2016-10-09,iVwWBc2fFY7BUcqAzKzMXP,"Growth in data revenue fell to 35% and 27%, respectively, for Bharti and Idea, from as high as 70-80% just a year ago",both,23:12,Telecom: slowing data growth a worry for industry

				Hospitals, especially in India, have for long cut a sorry figure in terms of their digital savvy and use of information technology (IT) to be on par with their counterparts in sectors such as banking and telecom.According to Tirupathi Karthik, CEO of Napier Healthcare, a Singapore-based provider of software solutions to the healthcare industry, As compared to a global average of 22.5% of income spent on IT by healthcare providers, or even 6-15% being invested in IT in other sectors within India, anecdotal data from multiple sources indicate that healthcare providers in India rarely spend more than 0.5% of their annual revenue on information technology.  But things have been changing for some time, albeit at a pace slower than many would want. Leading the change are large hospital chains such as Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd, Max Healthcare Institute Ltd and Fortis Healthcare Ltd.Prodded on by the need to take control of their sprawling operationswhich span dozens of hospitals in multiple citieson the one hand, and the rising expectations of tech-empowered consumers on the other, these modern hospitals are setting the template for healthcare in India.High time they did so. If you looked at the hospitals in India around 10 years back, they were very basic in terms of tech infrastructure. Besides, independent doctors got what they pretty much wanted. This led to lack of control with the management and poor visibility into the entire treatment and costs hospitals had to bear, says Varun Gera, founder and chief executive of HealthAssure Pvt. Ltd, a primary  healthcare aggregator that has partnered with almost 2,300 clinics, including diagnostic labs and hospital OPDs (out-patient departments). He says that somewhere along the line hospitals had to work as hospitals and it could no longer be the case of doctors having their own way of doing things. While part of this doctors-management clash had to do with egos, a more significant role was played by ITthe lack of it in the early days and increasing enablement as time went on. It is the clinical protocols, organisation-wide processes and use of IT tools through which hospitals, particularly those with a corporate road map to grow fast, could gain better control, get visibility into how treatment is given, and embrace more standardization for better healthcare outcomes across their chain of facilities.Once processes and IT tools began to be adopted, hospitals moved on from using basic networking and hospital information systems (HIS) to looking at electronic medical records (EMRs) and other advanced deployments for improving efficiency as well as patient care.According to research firm Gartner Inc., Indian healthcare providers are set to spend $1.2 billion on IT products and services in 2016, including telecom services.  Among the key areas in which hospitals are increasingly focusing their IT efforts are online doctor appointments, data capture of patients visiting the hospitals and applying analytics tools to get insights into their operations.One of the large hospital chains investing big time in IT is Apollo. One of the things we have done is enabled online appointment for doctors. Earlier, less than 10% of our patients came by appointment. Now at Apollo almost 50% of patients are coming by appointment, says Sangita Reddy, joint managing director, Apollo Hospitals.That is a huge change in terms of avoiding the chaos resulting from a lot of patients just landing up at its hospitals all over India. It also allows Apollo to focus on the more important task of clinical care rather than manage hordes of patients shuffling from one department to the other on its premises.More significant change is afoot through the use of data analytics for both clinical and non-clinical insights. We are collecting about 55% of all our patients clinical data electronically, which is enabling us to create a digital warehouse. This digital warehouse, in turn, is enabling us to do data mining and use this data in different ways, says Reddy.These efforts are helping Apollo in workflow prediction, staffing, communication, etc., and helping the organization turn into a data-driven enterprise.One of the key areas in which analytics is being applied at Apollo, according to Reddy, is the use of predictive analytics for clinical purposes. We have pioneered the concept of personalized health check-ups in India: instead of a common check-up, it is customized based on analytics of data of almost 1 million patients that have visited our hospitals over the years, she says. The decision tree for providing healthcare is being evolved based on scenario building through matching a particular medicine with a particular disease or condition that previous patients had encountered. The result is quicker treatment with improved outcomes.The analytics tool enhances the effectiveness of the medication that doctors choose, says Reddy.On the question of the acceptance of such tools by the medical fraternity, she says, We use these predictive analytics tools in a recommendatory manner, so its not forced on the doctorsand we have found a very high degree of acceptance. Currently being used in its large hospitals, Apollo will soon extend its use to other hospitals as well.There is a lot of scope for improvement in the way hospitals in India operate and use IT to manage operations and deliver healthcare in a seamless manner taking into account the intricacies involved in settling health insurance claims. According to Gera, The whole focus now is on getting the data out and efficiency of operations. The way hospitals operate currently is much fractured, as there are multiple complexities involved in their operations.And while technology cannot do everything for hospitals, the right tools and processes can make a big difference to the quality and speed of healthcare delivery in India.Among the tools for improving or aiding clinical outcomes, International Business Machines Corp.s Watson cognitive computing solutions for healthcare are being considered by many hospitals in India. One of the first to implement it is Manipal Hospital Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. According to IBM, Watson for Oncology is now in use by oncologists at six locations in the Manipal Hospitals network to provide information and insights to physicians to help them identify personalised, evidence-based cancer care options across India.If the past decade signified the modernisation of hospitals in terms of physical infrastructure, medical equipment and the like, the next one is likely to be defined by integration of multiple IT tools, advanced analytics solutions, health monitoring devices and Internet of Thingsunder which medical devices, computer systems, smartphones and diagnostic equipment will share data with each other in real time for individualised, improved healthcare.",2016-11-04,iX1AMyGsjOevaUwtoZVn4N,"Hospitals have for long cut a sorry figure in terms of digital savvy and the use of information technology.

0.54,"Bangalore/Mumbai: Amid the carnage on Wall Street in 2008, as Bank of America Corp. was trying to forge its rushed merger with Merrill Lynch & Co., Natarajan Chandrasekaran boarded a plane for New York to try to reassure the two financial behemoths that an Indian IT company could make the systems of their strikingly different cultures work together.
				   
				Chandrasekaran, known as Chandra, was then chief operating officer of Asias largest IT services exporter, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS). Over the following weeks he fended off global rivals who smelled an opportunity to muscle in, and set about integrating the banks systems and assuaging the new managements anxieties about outsourcing to a foreign supplier. TCS kept the business and grew it substantially.Last week, Chandra, now chief executive officer of TCS, was chosen for an even more fraught diplomatic task: to resurrect the image and fortunes of the Tata Group, Indias biggest conglomerate, which has been racked by losses at some of its biggest units, and by a boardroom battle that has threatened to turn the workings of the venerable corporation into a media soap-opera.Tata Sons, the group holding company, named Chandra, 53, as chairman, taking over on 21 February from interim chairman Ratan Tata. Tata, 79, had run the family business for more than two decades before handing over in 2012 to his hand-picked successor, Cyrus Mistry. In October, Tata Sons shocked Indias corporate community by firing Mistry, reinstalling Ratan Tata and promising to find a replacement by March. Chandra was a front runner for the job, a Tata employee almost all his working life, who grew TCS into the conglomerates most successful business, with about $16 billion in sales.Yet he is both an insider and an outsider. While he has been with the group since joining as an intern three decades ago, he is the first chairman who is not a Parsi, the shrinking ethnic group of Zoroastrians that boasts a disproportionately high number of Indias business elite. He is only the third person without the Tata name to get the job, and the first without a close family tie to the Tatas.IT CareerMoreover, his career and success has all been with TCS, virtually an island within the group that serves many of the worlds top corporations with a young, skilled, technical workforce. As head of Tata Sons, he will be responsible for a conglomerate that assembles buses in Zambia, serves prawn kalimiri to diners at its Bombay Brasserie in London, sells salt to Indian families at Rs18(27 cents) a kilo, and runs hundreds of other businesses across the world.He served both TCS and the customer commendably during the BofA-ML merger. Now he has the chance to build a positive organization by bonding together various companies and their half-a-million plus employees, said S. Ramadorai, the previous CEO of TCS. He is non-confrontational and, at the same time, does not foolishly ignore problems.Chandras appointment came after TCS announced it had made the equivalent of $1 billion in quarterly profit for the first time. Tatas star unit accounts for over half of the groups market value.A five-man panel unanimously chose Chandra from a list of more than a dozen candidates. He stood out both within the group and outside, said former bureaucrat Vijay Singh, a non-executive director on the board of Tata Sons, which ratified the selection. A Tata Sons statement said Chandra would uphold the groups values and adhere to its high standard of practicesthings the board previously accused Mistry of failing to do.We are at an inflection point, said Chandra in a statement after his appointment. I am aware that this role comes with huge responsibilities. It will be my endeavor to help progress the group with the ethos, ethics and values that the Tata group has been built on. Chandra declined an interview request for this story.Steel lossesFacing him is a menu of corporate issues, including the money-losing UK operations of Tata Steel Ltd., the overhang from failed ambitions like Tata Motors Ltd.s cheap Nano car, debt-ridden Indian Hotels Co., and a $1.17 billion arbitration battle with telecom partner NTT Docomo Inc. Mistry has previously defended his time as chairman, when he tried to reduce debt built up during a series of global acquisitions by Ratan Tata. In an e-mail to directors after his dismissal, Mistry said the group may face Rs1.18 trillion in writedowns over time because of  legacy hotspots he inherited.Mistry, whose family owns an 18% stake in Tata Sons, filed a case with the National Company Law Tribunal seeking the appointment of an administrator to oversee the companys affairs, a forensic audit and a probe into the role of the trustees of Tata trusts, the majority shareholders of Tata Sons. Hes asked for Ratan Tata, head of the trusts, to be restrained from attending board meetings. A spokesman for Mistry said he would not comment as the matter is subject to the legal proceedings.Investors expect Chandra to act quickly to resolve governance issues, said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director at proxy advisory firm InGovern Research Services Pvt. Key to his success will be how he handles Ratan Tata, who has indicated that he may step down as chairman of the trusts this year. Tata instigated the Nano project, a troubled airline venture and many of the other expansions that are now draining the groups resources.Tata congratulated Chandra on Twitter, saying he was sure the new chairman would protect the groups values and ethics. A Tata Group spokesman declined to comment.Chandra is an optimist, he thinks big and will go after positive outcomes in the new job, said Krishnakumar N., executive chairman of rival Indian IT services company Mindtree Ltd.The son of a farmer in rural southern India, Chandra studied in a Tamil-language school rather than gaining the English-language education favored by the middle class.He joined TCS in 1987 after completing a masters in Computer Applications from Regional Engineering College, Trichy, Tamil Nadu. His leadership talent was spotted by Ramadorai in 1993 when Chandra was praised by customer International Business Machines Corp. He was put in charge of a major project for British Telecommunications Plc. When Ramadorai became TCSs CEO, he chose Chandra as his executive assistant.He loved meeting customers, and it was never a Hi-How-Are-You? kind of a meeting, Ramadorai said in a telephone interview. He put the client at the center of the universe, made every conversation count and nurtured clients like American Express.Young CEOChandra took over as chief executive of TCS in 2009 at the age of 46.

				A stronger US dollar also weighed as the currency surge made it more expensive to hold dollar-denominated commodities. Brent crude futures were down $1.01, or 1.8%, at $56.09 a barrel at 3.36pm.

0.46,"San Francisco/Seattle: Steve Ballmer said his decision to push Microsoft Corp. into the hardware business contributed to the breakdown of his relationship with longtime friend and company co-founder Bill Gates. Ballmers only regret: not doing it sooner.
				   
				Ballmer, who was chief executive officer of Microsoft for 14 years, told Bloomberg that if he could do it all again, he would have entered the mobile device market years earlier. When he finally did, Gates and other members of the board disagreed, he said.Ballmer, now owner of the NBAs Los Angeles Clippers, told Bloombergs Emily Chang, that he and Gates have drifted apart partly due to a disagreement over whether Microsoft should make its own handsets and tablets. It was definitely not a simple thing for either one of us, he said. There was a little bit of a difference in opinion on the strategic direction of the company.Ballmer said they had a brotherly relationship in the good parts and the bad parts. Towards the end, that was a bit more difficult than not, particularly with the strategic direction change and you know, the stock price isnt going anywhere, so the rest of the board felt pressure  despite the fact that profits were going up  so I think you had kind of a combustible situation, he recalled.There was a fundamental disagreement about how important it was to be in the hardware business, Ballmer said. I had pushed Surface. The board had been a little  little reluctant in supporting it. And then things came to a climax around what to do about the phone business.Microsoft entered the market in 2012 with the Surface RT, a tablet that sold poorly and required Microsoft to take a $900 million charge to write down the value of inventory. Now, the rejiggered Surface business is profitable and generated more than $4 billion in sales for the most recent year. Microsofts foray was a mess almost from the start, with Microsofts board rejecting Ballmers initial plan to acquire Nokia Oyjs handset unit. By the time the $9.5 billion deal closed, Ballmer had handed the reins over to Satya Nadella and the Nokia business was in tatters. Microsoft has now written down almost the entire value of the deal and laid off most of the workers. Ballmer said the mistake was getting into handsets and tablets too late. I would have moved into the hardware business faster and recognized that what we had in the PC, where there was a separation of chips, systems and software, wasnt largely gonna reproduce itself in the mobile world, he said.What about that famous quote where Ballmer said Apple Inc.s iPhone would never sell because it cost too much? He now wishes hed realized how Apple was going to make it work  through mobile carrier subsidies. I wish Id thought about the model of subsidizing phones through the operators, he said. You know, people like to point to this quote where I said iPhones will never sell, because the price at $600 or $700 was too high. And there was business model innovation by Apple to get it essentially built into the monthly cell phone bill. Bloomberg",2016-11-05,iqmg6Ip4XiE3BwWVcSXipK,Steve Ballmer says his decision to push Microsoft into the hardware business breakdown of his relationship with Bill Gates.

-0.48,"Hong Kong: Its not the e-commerce business thatll command the most attention when Alibaba Group Holding Ltd posts earnings Wednesday. Its the nascent cloud computing division that investors will scrutinize instead.
				   
				Chinas largest Internet company reports just a week before Katy Perry and other stars headline a launch party for the annual Singles Day online shopping extravaganza. Yet its the less flashy Internet-based computing unit thats in the spotlight now that its e-commerce juggernaut is plateauing and the payoff from nascent businesses such as entertainment remains years away.Taking Amazon.com Inc.s approach, Alibaba has placed cloud at the heart of its global expansion, eyeing top share in Japan in two years and beefing up its presence from the Middle East to the US. It already hosts more than a third of Chinas websites. The companys fastest-growing division probably helped power 53% growth in group revenue to 33.9 billion yuan ($5 billion) last quarter, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. And unlike other businesses such as video streaming or on-demand services, it may be close to contributing to the bottom line. People have really high expectations for the cloud unit, said Billy Leung, an analyst at Haitong International Securities Co. For me, its already in the books, in the share price.Shares of Alibaba have surged 24% this year compared with a rise of just 2.7% for the NYSE Composite Index.Alibaba has only recently begun to make inroads beyond China and into a global cloud market dominated by Amazon and Microsoft Corp. Its the biggest provider of Internet-based computingeverything from storage and data analysis to server hostingfor government agencies and corporations within its home market, but abroad its more narrowly focused on supporting Chinese-based organizations on foreign soil. The division now accounts for less than 5% of Alibabas revenue, the lions share of which comes from an e-commerce division still growing at double-digit rates.But that proportion is climbing steadily and could help the company grapple with a profusion of difficulties facing the wider economy. Chinese gross domestic product grew 6.7% in the third quarter, its slowest pace of expansion since 2009. One of the key focuses this quarter will be Alibabas cloud unit performance, said Li Muzhi, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Arete Research Services LLP who expects the units revenue to soar 130% to 1.49 billion yuan. If Alibabas cloud unit breaks even this quarter, that would be a confidence booster for investors.Like Amazons, Alibabas cloud service emerged from the enormous computational power needed to handle millions of online shopping transactions. But unlike its US counterpart, it enjoys home-field advantage in a vast Chinese market where web-based computing is still novel to many enterprises. Its push into cloud, where software and services are provided to customers via server farms the size of football fields, prompted a second data center in Silicon Valley and preparation for its first in Europe. Along the way, Alibaba forged partnerships with industry giants like Intel Corp. and Nvidia Corp. In July, the divisions president proclaimed it could match or even surpass Amazon within three to four years.Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma once referred to data as the new oil. Chief executive officer Daniel Zhang said last month that cloud computing will underpin the upgrading of Chinas $4 trillion retail market, one of the companys biggest opportunities. He envisions building a system that monitors in-store sales as they happen, giving retailers and brands the ability to adjust in real time.If that happens, the cloud could well become one of Alibabas bigger profit centers. Amazon Web Services earned $861 million of operating income last quarter, by far the US companys most lucrative division.Alibaba said in August that the unit was close to breaking even, driven by some 577,000 paying customers. Overall, Alibaba is expected to post 7 billion yuan of net income, a 69% drop propelled in part by the integration of loss-making online video streaming business Youku Tudou and Lazada Group SA, acquired earlier this year.Cloud is the next revenue driver, Credit Suisse analysts Evan Zhou and Monica Chen wrote in a note last week, tagging its growth for the September quarter at about 147%.

-0.25,"On 15 January, at least 42,000 runners lined up at the starting point of the Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon, the largest road-run event in Asia. Jaspal Bindra, who came up with the idea in 2004, was nowhere to be seen. In 2016 too, he was not around. 
				   
				Bindra, the banks chief executive officer (CEO) for Asia and group executive director till early 2015, had not missed a single Mumbai Marathon till 2016. He had been living in Hong Kong from 2008 but would fly down for the eventalways held on the third Sunday in Januaryand cheer the runners. A few days ahead of the Mumbai Marathon, Bindra, 56, is a few minutes late for our luncheon meeting  at the NRI (Not Really Indian) restaurant at the Bandra-Kurla Complex in Mumbai. To avoid the hassle of choosing individual dishes, we opt for Jugal Bandi, a meal for two, accompanied by a glass of Chandon Brut each. The starters are South African peri peri wings, BBQ prawns and a Burmese green tea salad; this year-old restaurant serves Indian-inflected cuisine from around the world. As always, Bindra is dressed immaculately, in a white shirt and sky-blue turban. Some 15 years ago, over dinner at a different restaurant in south Mumbaihe was then regional general manager, India, and CEO of Standard Chartered BankBindra, digging into his chicken satay and prawn tempura, had commented, As long as I have an active sex life, I dont need to play golf. Those were not Twitter days, so it did not get wide publicity, but the banking community took note. He was perceived to be aggressive, someone who calls a spade a spade.During his two-year tenure as head of corporate and institutional banking at StanChart (1998-2000) and later as the head of both StanChart and ANZ Grindlays (he oversaw the merger of the two), Bindra showed 3,200 employees the doornearly 50% of the employee strength then.By a twist of fate, he himself had to quit the bank where he was one of the top five executives. Did he feel insecure after the StanChart board, under pressure from shareholders, asked CEO Peter Sands to leave? Bindras answer is quite logical. He was one of the top four executives of the bank reporting to Sands. The others were Mike Rees (overseeing the wholesale and retail assets), Andy Halford (group chief financial officer) and V. Shankar (another banker of Indian origin, in charge of Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Americas). Had the new CEO come from within the bank, I would have got a different responsibility. But since Sands successor came from outside, all four of us would have continued to do the same job. At mid-50s, I was looking for a different responsibility, he says. Was he eyeing the top job? Well, maybe not at that point of time but yes, if I had stuck around, I would have liked the challenge, Bindra says, nibbling on the spicy wings.He was the first to leave after Sands. By end-February 2015, he had put in his papers. Shankar and Rees followed him. Did he get a ton of money as a severance package? The standard practice in the bank is one years remuneration when a board-level executive quits. And he was not allowed to take up any job in the financial sector for a year after resigning.I cannot resist the temptation of asking how StanChart got into a situation in India where its bad assets ballooned and profits plunged. India, which accounts for anything from 15-20% of the banks global profits, and is probably the second-most important market along with Singapore, after Hong Kong, has gone through a real bad patch in the past few years. Was the local management (which was reporting to Bindra) reckless? Was it greed for balance-sheet growth that got the bank into trouble?Bindra says the bank actually weathered the collapse of Lehman Brothers well and continued to show growth in profit until 2012. Thereafter, it suffered on account of a severe structural shrinkage in commodity prices. What he means is that the companies to which the bank had exposure were in the commodity space and once they suffered, their ability to service bank loans was dented.Why did StanChart take such large exposures to so many companies in India which have in any case been over-leveraged, laden with loans they couldnt repay? Bindra says this assumption is not entirely correct. Our internal norms do not allow the bank to take more than 50% exposure in any loan. This means that even if it gives, say, a $1 billion loan to a particular company, it sells down 50-75% of it to other lenders within 90 days of disbursing the loan. So, we were as affected as others. It is not fair to say only StanChart accumulated bad assets.As the main course arrivesSri Lankan Potli Murg and dal makhani with tandoori roti and riceI decide to shift my focus to the present. Like quite a few other global Indian bankers, he is back in the country to do something on his own. Is it the proverbial return of the prodigal son? Also, what made him pick up a stake in Centrum Capital Ltd, a non-banking finance company (NBFC), and become an entrepreneur?I was 55 when I was leaving StanChart. I had three choices before meI could have got a similar job overseas and probably run a smaller bank as CEO; partially retire and join a few boards of companies and offer advisory services; or become an entrepreneur. And if I were to be an entrepreneur, it had to be in India, he says. Where else can you grow business in the banking and finance space? The public sector banks are losing their market share, foreign banks are shrinking business by design.... This is the best time to be in India. I could not afford to miss this window, Bindra says.Last April, he reportedly picked up close to a 20% stake in Centrum, started in 1995 by Bindras long-time friend Chandir Gidwani and Khushrooh Byramjee at the Bombay Mutual Building in Fort. It is a financial services firm with a presence in corporate finance, foreign exchange, wealth management, institutional broking and investment banking. It manages around Rs10,000- crore assets in its wealth management portfolio but does not have a balance sheet as such, for it does not give loans. Bindra is adding that piece to Centrum. He has started giving loans ranging from Rs5-20 crore to small and medium-size entrepreneurs. Not too many banks dabble in this segment where financing is based primarily on cash flows, not balance sheets. He has already built a portfolio of Rs400 crore in this business. Another new business is small and affordable housing finance in the range of Rs10-25 lakh. Again, there is a huge opportunity with the governments big push for affordable housing and drop in the cost of money. The third new fund-based business is private equity. We need to compete with some of the private banks and a few other NBFCs, not the entire banking system, Bindra says.When he picked up the stake in Centrum, the market value of the NBFC was Rs450 crore. Now it has crossed Rs1,500 crore. I assume that at Rs450 crore market value, for a 20% stake, he would have put in Rs90 crore. But Bindra says that may not be the correct figure as he has picked up a stake in the holding company, not the listed entity. Now all three partnersGidwani, Byramjee and Bindrahold equal stakes of around 20% each in the listed entity.After graduating from XLRI, a management school in Jamshedpur, Bindra joined Bank of America, where he spent 10 years. He spent another five at the Union Bank of Switzerland as head of business development in India before shifting to StanChart in August 1998, where he remained for 17 years. Brought up in Kolkata and many district towns in West Bengal (his father was a police officer), Bindras Bengal connection is still alive. His wife is from Asansol, and he visits his in-laws often. He can speak fluent Bengali but has not developed a sweet tooth. So, while I choose butterscotch ice cream for dessert, he orders coffee.The last round of conversation predictably revolves around demonetization. He joins the discussion a bit diplomatically. He agrees that digital banking in the unorganized sector is not easy but says that once we go cashless, the cost of operations will definitely come down and size will become less relevant for NBFCs. Currently, Centrum employs 2,000 people; for the foreign exchange business, its biggest earner, it has a presence at 19 airports and 100 outlets spread over 45 cities. Money is not a problem. There are plenty of funds available both as debt and equity. My challenge is to grow and build a solid track record and be in the reckoning to set up a bank. If available, we can buy a bank too, he says. All these, if at all, will happen after 2020. Till then, he wants to build a solid NBFC which can compete with private banks effectively.Like the Mumbai Marathon, StanCharts Indian Depository Receipts, or IDR, was also Bindras baby. He agrees with me that it was a flop. There have been issues such as tax and the class of investors who could buy IDRs. The insurance firms were never allowed to buy.... It was an experiment that failed, he says. StanChart remains the first and only foreign company to launch an IDR. But all that is behind him. I remind him of his life-size bronze statue on the eighth floor of Standard Chartered Bank Plcs old headquarters at Londons 1, Aldermanbury Squarea unique initiative of the bank to showcase the diversity of its employee base. In June 2013, the headquarters were shifted to 1, Basinghall Avenue in London. Does the new office still have his statue? He shrugs his shoulders. Bindra doesnt really care much for such things now.That day, the Centrum stock hit its lifetime high of Rs34.50. In 2016, when Bindra took over as the executive chairman and a promoter, it was trading at around Rs10.His favourite memory: Carrying the Olympic-flame torch for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.One assignment he loved: Global head of diversity and inclusion at StanChart, 2005-13.His hobby: Watching films, travelling with his wife.Favourite place on earth: Asansol, where his in-laws live (to keep his marriage alive!).One thing he would like to forget: the StanChart IDR; it was ahead of its time.One achievement he is proud of: the Mumbai Marathon.One bit of media coverage that he cherishes: Being featured in  Time magazine in 2010.",2017-01-27,ivDxiaKv9AlNq4jlbx7hyN,"Standard Chartereds man for India till early 2015, Bindra is back  now as an entrepreneur",competitor,15:32,Jaspal Bindra: Return of the prodigal son
-0.69,"Bengaluru: In 1999, British entrepreneur Kevin Ashton coined the term Internet of Things while he was working at Procter & Gamble. Around that time, he made a presentation on putting sensors in everyday objects that would be powered by the Internet. Shortly afterwards, he co-founded a research centre in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology called the Auto-ID Centre.
				   
				Since then, Ashton founded three more companies in IoT. In an interview on the sidelines of the Nasscom Engineering Summit on Wednesday on IoTs evolution and challenges. On a lighter note, when asked about the US presidential elections, Ashton said emphatically, Trump wont win. He doesnt stand a chance. Edited excerpts:Its been 17 years since you coined the term Internet of Things. However, overall results in terms of scaling up have been mixed. Is IoT facing a mid-life crisis of sorts?I think I am! (laughs) Nothe very interesting thing that you see about the Internet of Things iswhen it works, its kind of invisible. Like all good technology. Just as a simple example, if you look at the rise of the smartphone, one of the funny things about smartphone is that its got the word phone in it today  because its not what it is. Its not a phone. Phone is an app that sometimes you use  so, what is a smartphone? Some say its a pocket-sized computer. But thats not really it either. At least not how I look at it because a typical smartphone today has as many as 10 network sensors. Thats twice as many as a human being. So its a very sentient platformand the obvious sensors are for example, cameras, microphones, etc. But your smartphone knows where it is even when you dont. It measures things like barometric pressuremany of them can detect your heartbeat or fingerprint or your moving. The vision of the Internet of Things is network sensors. Also Read: Indian IoT market to touch $15 billion by 2020: NasscomAnd the smartphone is just a visible example of a network sensor platformthe irony is that just because its called a phone nobody seems to realise it. My view is that were 15 years into a 100-year roll-out. So, I think if theres any sort of crisis to IoT, itll be a teenage sort of crisis were still in a very early growth phaseI dont think weve grown up yet. IoT deployments are moving at a much slower pace than was originally hoped. In many organisations, its still at a proof of concept stage. Why is the IoT facing challenges in scaling up?Its a software challenge that you have right now. We got very good at gathering sensor data. Sensors have become very cheap, networking has become very cheapthe new challenge is how to automatically process that data. In the 20th century, you got some data and you put it on a spreadsheet and everybody looked at the spreadsheet. In the 21st century, the machine looks at the data and figures out whats important and what to do with the data. Theres some complexity theretechnological machine learning is getting better all the time, but thats the limit right now. What are the futuristic applications of IoT that seem like science fiction now?The technology points to what you call autonomous automation. So, we think of automation right now, we think of giving machine a task, it executes a task, it stops. What will happen in the Internet of Things age is thats the back-loop thatll keep turning. The machine will change something in the world somehow, they will then sense that change and then figure out what to do next with that change. Any examples that you can think of? The easy one is self-driving cars. Thats coming very quickly everywhere... So this sort of continuous autonomous automation which will start with self-driving cars, I think that technology will start applying itself in the home where youll see things like more sophisticated vacuum cleaners, things like laundering which today is barely automaticthats the kind of stuff that youre going to see. Continuous autonomous automation.How does India compare with the tech boom that you saw in the US?The first time I came to India I came as a student and I got a tourist railway pass. I was in Bombay and then I travelled around the country kind of in a clockwise direction. I always told my Indian friends that Ive seen more of India than they have. Because of the direction of travel, Bangalore was one of the last places I came to and the contrast between Bangalore and what was Calcutta back then and Delhi and Bombay was very striking. And so, its always amazing to come back here and remember what it was like. And thats representative of the changes around the world. Which is the age of United States as a world technology leader is really overwhich is very surprising to Americans because they talk about Facebook or Google. But if you look at whats been going on in the market, US tech exports is sort of flat to declining and then you have Asian nations particularly China, Korea, Singapore and India that are on the rise. And whats fuelling that is very interesting to think about when youre in Bangalore  which is what drove America to technological excellence in the 20th century was the establishment of some major technology universities between 1900 and 1950 and then significant government investment in science and research and development between 1950 and 1970. And those investments laid the foundation for, take for example, all the tech companies of the dotcom boom, and were seeing the end of that tail now with Google and Facebook. Now if you look at whats happened in Asia, you basically see the same path only a little later. Theres an investment in education in technology, followed by government investment in pure science and R&D which is inevitably followed by an expansive technology sector that is supposed to be disruptive to more mature tech economies. If you think of India with that pattern in mind, you have IITs everywhere, which in the 20th century exported its undergraduates to places like MIT but now they are coming back.What you see in India is also an amazing space program right here in Bangalore, increasing investment in defence and development. And what that is inevitably leading to is India becoming not just an offshore-outsource subsidiary centre of technology, but also a leading exporter of high technology and leading user of high technology. I expect that we really are at the beginning of the Indian technology revolutionTheyre going to form amazing technology companies and theyll do it in areas like the Internet of Things which is new and disruptiveIts great to come here and talk about the Internet of Things because my expectation is that 5-10 years from now, India will be one of the top three IoT tech exporters in the world.

-0.27,"Sachin Bansal, co-founder and chairman of Flipkart, Indias largest e-commerce firm, cut a rather sorry figure last week when he sought government protection at a public forum to stave off competition from foreign players.
				   
				Bansal and Flipkart have had a rather tough year. It has been more than 12 months since the Bengaluru-based firm raised any kind of capital after gobbling up nearly $3 billion over the past few years.For Flipkart and the gaggle of local companies that make up Indias e-commerce sector, not having capital available on tap is a new, even alien, feeling.For nearly two years, investors of every huefrom venture capital firms to hedge funds to strategic investorsscrambled to outdo each other in bankrolling the countrys e-commerce wave, very often at valuations that are looking less and less defensible today.Last year, e-commerce companies raised a record $3.9 billion in fresh funding from investors. Flipkart and its New Delhi-based rival Snapdeal alone cornered $1.7 billion.This year, with a correction underway in the start-up funding market, the story for e-commerce has played out very differently.In the nine months to September, the sector pulled in just $1.4 billion in fresh funding. Big-ticket deals have become a thing of the past. Grocery e-tailer BigBasket, ticketing platform Bookmyshow and eyewear e-tailer Lenskart were the only three firms that pulled in serious money. BigBasket raised $150 million in March from an investor consortium led by Dubais Abraaj Group; Bookmyshow closed a $81.5 million growth round in May from a group of investors led by New York-based private equity firm Stripes Group, and Lenskart raised $60 million from International Finance Corp., TPG Growth and other investors. Another potentially large deal this year was e-commerce marketplace Shopclues growth round in January. The company didnt disclose the size of the round, but it is estimated at between $100 million and $140 million.There havent been very many more deals over the last two months, and it is unlikely that the e-commerce sector will muster much in whats left of the current quarter. Theres an outside chance that Flipkart may still score a funding round before December ends. The company, Mint reported in October, is currently in the market to raise anywhere between $500 million and $1 billion.Talks were reportedly initiated with Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the worlds largest retailer, but they dont seem to have headed anywhere productive yet. Last month, Mint reported that the e-commerce company may now seek the assistance of investment banks, something it has not done in years, to muster the next round of funds.It may be argued that Flipkart alone doesnt represent the e-commerce sector. However, given that it accounts for nearly 20% of the $15-odd billion that Indias start-ups across sectors have raised over the past decade, its ups and downs do have a bearing on the market and, especially, the e-commerce sector. The frequent valuation markdowns it has had to take over the past 11 months by mutual fund stakeholders, for instance, have impacted valuations across the consumer Internet sector, not just e-commerce. And, the fact that the biggest investor in the company, New York-based hedge fund Tiger Global Management, seems to have taken a back seat in its ongoing fund-raising campaign doesnt inspire much confidence either. In the past, Tiger Global, easily the most aggressive investor in Indias consumer Internet market until late last year, has usually taken a lead in pumping fresh capital into Flipkart.A lot of Flipkarts and the e-commerce sectors woes are due to Tiger Global and the posse of hedge funds that dominated the e-commerce funding market for the past two years. When China devalued the yuan last year, leading to a turmoil in the global financial markets, hedge funds quickly beat a retreat from Indias start-up market. Suddenly, the abundant supply of later-stage private capital that was available to the e-commerce sector, often at inordinately high valuations, vanished. For market leaders such as Flipkart and Snapdeal, this meant they now had to battle the biggest threat to their turfs, Seattle-based Amazon, on the basis of execution and unit economics rather than capital. Capital, of course, isnt a constraint for Amazon. It announced a $2 billion outlay for the Indian e-commerce market in 2014 and added another $3 billion in June this year.For venture capitalists, who were largely driven to the sidelines of the e-commerce sweepstakes by hedge funds, the market correction hasnt turned out to be such a bad thing. While funding in the e-commerce sector has slowed, early-stage and some later-stage investors continue to back companies. Niches or verticals have emerged as a theme for investments this year. At least three business-to-business marketplacesUdaan, Bizongo and Ninjacarthave raised funding worth $16 million from early-stage investors such as Accel Partners, Inventus Capital Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners and IDG Ventures India. Power2Sme also raised fresh capital but hasnt disclosed the size of the round. Another recurring theme is marketplaces for rentals of used products. Three start-upsZefo, Furlenco and Rentomojoraised a combined $26 million from investors such as Lightbox Ventures, Sequoia Capital and Helion Venture Partners.Based on a rough survey of e-commerce deals done this year, we found about 26 deals that have some kind of venture capital backing. Series A deals, the first round of venture capital in a start-up, account for 11 of those deals, indicating that early-stage investors are back to seeking out the next generation of e-commerce companies. While the verdict is out on whether the earlier generation of companiesthe Flipkarts and the Snapdealswill ride out the prevailing downturn in fortunes, Indias e-commerce wave is far from over.Snigdha Sengupta is a consulting writer with Mint.

-0.64,"Bangalore: Apple Inc. is willing to start making iPhones in India, but it wants a big helping hand from Narendra Modis government first.
				   
				The Cupertino, California-based company is scheduled to meet with officials in New Delhi next week to discuss the prospects for setting up manufacturing facilities in the country this year. Apple, the most valuable company on Earth, is asking for a long list of financial concessions from India, one of the poorest countries. Among the requests, the company is seeking a 15-year tax holiday on imports of components and equipment, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.We would like Apple to set up base in India, Ravi Shankar Prasad, minister for information technology said on Wednesday, without disclosing the companys negotiating stance.Apple wants to boost business in India as the country of 1.3 billion becomes the fastest-growing smartphone market and sales flatten in the US and China. Chief executive officer Tim Cook visited the country for the first time in May as he sought government approval for Apple to open its own stores. India has insisted that Apple, like any single-brand retailer, source 30% of its components locally, though the country is relaxing those rules so technology companies can operate stores for three years before meeting that requirement.Still, Apple wants more. The company has sent a list of requests ahead of its 25 January meeting with officials from several government departments, including Electronics and Commerce, the person said, asking not to be named because the matter is private. Apple is also asking for a waiver on customs duties for new and used equipment brought into India. The Indian Express newspaper reported Apple wants full exemption from duties on raw materials, components and capital equipment. Apple wont insist on getting everything on its wish list, the person said. Apple didnt respond to requests for comment.The company doesnt manufacture devices itself, but rather partners with contract manufacturers to handle the capital intensive demands of building factories and hiring staff. One surprise in India is that Apple plans to partner with Taiwans Wistron Corp. rather than Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., its usual manufacturing source, according to the person. Assembly of iPhones could start at Wistrons existing facility in the suburbs of Bengaluru, the person said. The work may be expanded to other suppliers including Hon Hai later, depending on demand, the person said.Apple and Indias officials have met several times amid a prolific exchange of correspondence, but next weeks meeting will be crucial. If the government gives in to Apples demands, it may have to offer similar incentives to other global brands, such as Samsung Electronics Co. and Xiaomi Corp.Historically, the government has given no such concessions to any other company and there is no room in the policy to do so, said Anshul Gupta, the Mumbai-based research director at Gartner Inc. What Apple is asking for is outside the trend so it will be interesting to see how the government looks at it.India isnt the only country pressing Apple for local manufacturing. US President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants to see iPhones made in Apples home market, part of a broader push to get companies to keep or create manufacturing jobs. Hon Hai has said that it is in preliminary discussions to broaden its investment in the US.Prime Minister Modi wants companies to make products in the country as part of his Make in India policy, aimed at reaping the benefits that come from manufacturing facilities and jobs. His administration doesnt want technology companies to sell products and take advantage of its vast consumer base without making their own capital investments.Despite its global success, Apple is a minor player in India, largely because its phones are too expensive for local consumers. Apple holds about 2 percent of the market in a country where about 500 million smartphones are expected to be sold in the next few years. Samsung Electronics Co. and local player Micromax Informatics Ltd. are the leaders, thanks largely to their low-cost devices. For Apple, setting up manufacturing and retailing facilities could make the devices cheaper and help fuel growth. Cook has said Apple is just scratching the surface in India.

0.24,"The strings attached to the governments relief measures for sugar mills are becoming visible. On Wednesday, shares of sugar mills fell after news that the government may impose stock limits. This is a regressive step, moving away from decontrol, but is not a surprise altogether.
				   
				Stock limits will mean sugar in excess of the limits will be sold, leading to more supply and lower prices. The governments concern must be rising sugar prices. But they have been rising since end-September, so why the late reaction? The increase in recent months has been rapid. Since end-January, wholesale sugar prices are up by as much as 17%, while they are up by 39% since end-September. Globally, sugar prices have risen because of bad weather affecting the sugar cane crop in major producing countries such as India, Brazil and Thailand.That stress is visible in Indias output. Sugar production as of 15 April is down by 8% at 24.3 million tonnes (mt) from a year ago, says the Indian Sugar Mills Association (Isma). Whether Ismas estimate of 26 mt will be met remains to be seen, as only 117 mills are operating as of 15 April, compared with 245 a year ago. Prices may keep rising, as this situation unfolds.So what? Prices rise and fall in a free market, sugar is a decontrolled sector, and prices had been lying low for years. Why deny mills a year or two of good profit growth in a cyclical industry?The government may think it has the moral right to keep prices in check. Sugar mills in India have wrung concessions from the government, in return for paying a higher price for sugar cane. Although the Rangarajan committee has advocated linking sugar cane purchase price to the price of sugar and by-products, major sugar producing states such as Uttar Pradesh have not implemented it.Mills in Uttar Pradesh are forced to pay a state-determined price. In turn, they delay payments to farmers, leading to huge arrears, resulting in a confrontation between mills and state governments. Over the past few years, the Uttar Pradesh government has given some concessions to mills.The central government too has taken a number of measures for the sector. These include levying higher import duties on sugar, making it mandatory for oil marketing companies to procure ethanol (including fixing the purchase price), soft loans and an excise duty exemption on ethanol.The idea was to give some financial support to sugar mills, and the government even looked the other way as sugar prices rose. The government asked sugar mills to export 4 mt of sugar by September 2016. The money realized was to be used to cut down cane arrears and limit domestic supply. However, exports have been below targeted levels as domestic prices were higher. That is unlikely to have gone down well with the government. Rising sugar prices are a bigger pain. People will complain, state elections are under way and it could push up inflation as well. Maybe, the government is only sounding a warning and does not actually intend to impose stock limits. If sugar prices cool down, it may hold back. Otherwise, stock limits are just one weapon in its arsenal.In the past, the government has come down heavily on rising sugar prices. It can do so again.

				In his budget speech, Jaitley said full electrification of 18,452 villages identified in 2015 will be achieved by 1 March 2018, for which Rs4,814 crore will be spent in the next financial year, a 43%jump from what is estimated to have spent this fiscal. Of this, so far, close to 12,000 villages have been electrified.Jaitly announced setting up of 20 GW of solar power capacity and feeding 7,000 railway stations with solar power, giving a major impetus to the shift to clean energy. Over the last two years, the share of solar power in the countys energy mix has been gradually increasing, while that of thermal power has been declining.

India has already built underground crude oil storage capacities at three locationsVishakhapatnam, Mangalore and Padur with a total 5.3 million tonne capacity. The facility at Vishakhapatnam has already been filled up and half of the Mangalore storage facility has been filled. India in January signed a deal with the United Arab Emirates for filling the rest of the facility at Mangalore.

				The impact of demonetisation on asset quality will start showing significantly in data for the January-March quarter, the rating agency said. Demonetisation is likely to push back the recovery in Indian banks asset quality, given the disruptive impact that cash shortages have had on the countrys large informal economy, Fitch Ratings said in a statement. Cash shortages caused by the demonetisation of large denomination currency notes have affected the income of many borrowers by holding back economic activity and reduced their short-term repayment abilities. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has allowed forbearance on some loans to the agricultural sector and small businesses, but these account for a relatively small share of outstanding lending, Fitch said. Fitch had previously expected the stressed-asset ratio for Indian banks to increase to 12% for the fiscal ending March 2017, from 11.4% in FY16.There is now a risk that the ratio will climb higher. We still believe that asset-quality indicators are close to their weakest level and will recover slowly over the next few years, but any turnaround is likely to have been pushed back by at least two quarters, it said. Demonetisation has also weighed on loan growth, at least in the short term as demand weakened in the uncertain economic environment and banks have had to focus on cash management instead of normal lending activities. Loan growth slowed to 4.8% in November 2016, from 6.7% in October. We now think it is likely that loan growth will be below our previous forecast of 10% in FY17 and may even slow from the 8.8% recorded in FY16, Fitch said. Banks have received a surge of low-cost funds as demonetised notes were deposited. Deposit growth accelerated to 15.9% year-on-year in November, from 9.2% in October, and the handful of banks that have released figures for the October-December quarter have reported low-cost deposit growth of 25-30% y-o-y. We think there is scope for further lending rate cuts, but much will depend on the proportion of new deposits that remains in the banking system. The lasting impact on bank depositsand lending rateswill become clear only after withdrawal limits are lifted, Fitch added.

-0.24,"New Delhi: The move to sell land owned by airports across the country is likely to bring windfall gains for real estate developers and  lift the valuations of existing airport operators, analysts say.
				   
				The government in the Union budget presented on Wednesday said the Airports Authority of India (AAI) Act will be amended to enable effective monetization of land assets and that the money thus raised would be used to upgrade airports.In essence, AAI, which owns most of the countrys 125 airports and holds 50,000 acres of urban airport land, will now be able to change its land usage policy. So far, airports were allowed to use their land only for airport-related activities such as car parking and hotels.  Now they can also sell land developers who want to build multiplexes, shopping malls and convention halls. Monetization of land would require some significant changes in the Airports Authority of India Act. For example, the demand in the market is for multiplexes, shopping malls, convention centers. But the AAI Act allows us to monetize airport land by sale and lease for very limited purposes. The proposed amendment will make us in tune with the market, AAI chairman Guruprasad Mohapatra said. The move will also help GMR Infrastructure Ltd-run Delhi airport and GVK Power and Infrastructure Ltd-operated Mumbai airport to improve their valuations. Both airports are on lease from AAI for 30 years, extendable by another 30. Delhi airport has 5,000 acres of land and Mumbai airport has about 2,000 acres. Both firms have indicated they would like to sell stakes to reduce debt and aviation consulting firm CAPA said in a September report that it expects GMR and GVK divestments could pave the way for leading foreign groups to enter the Indian market. Recently, Delhi airport also gave out 200,000 sq. m of space to Bharti Realty Holdings to build what will be one of Indias largest shopping malls.GMR and GVK declined to comment. At the time, the airport had some concerns on whether this could be questioned later.In effect this new move legalises this, said a person familiar with the development, declining to be named.  It will certainly help valuations. In the first phase of airport development, Delhi airport had leased out 45 acres of land to build hotels and raised Rs1,471 crore in upfront fees to fund the Rs13,000 crore airport modernization plan.An AAI official who did not want to be named said private-sector companies have been lobbying the government for the move to change the land-use policy for several years. The private sector was very keen on change of land usage. This matter was not being allowed for a long time, this official said. The real benefit will come to Delhi and Mumbai airports as they are within the city and have big land bank. Thats the whole play. The 350-acre Safdarjung Airport complex in the heart of the capital, which also houses the aviation ministry and the AAI headquarters, has long been eyed by commercial developers, but comes under a high-security zone. The airport is used only for VIP flights, including those by the prime minister.A top government official previously with the aviation ministry said he worries about the land and long-term impact on AAI. AAI has been monetizing it for a long time by leasing the lands out on a consideration of land rent or revenue share. What is new in this? I understand that the proposal is to sell the lands to real estate developers. Some friendly developers will be able to buy the land.

-0.03,"Since the start of fiscal 2017, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Ltd shares have lost a fifth of their value. The companys financial performance has been hit by supply constraints in FY16 and some of that has continued into FY17 as well. Price controls have hurt too. These are expected to taper from FY17 onwards, however.
				   
				In the June quarter, sales grew by 8% to Rs.685 crore, but price cuts took away Rs.20 crore in sales, and supply constraints took away Rs.55 crore, disclosed the management in its annual analyst meet this week. In the 12 months ended March 2016, these constraints ate up Rs.350 crore worth of sales. The shortfall is blamed on shortages of vaccine supplies by the parent and a shortfall in active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) supply for Neosporin (an anti-infective). An API is the main ingredient used to make a formulation.These constraints are easing in FY17 and will go away by the end of the fiscal year, according to a post-analyst meet note by Nomura Research. That should see sales growth recover progressively, with a low-base helping too. On the price control front, 23% of GSK Pharmas sales in FY16 are in the essential list that is subject to price control. It expects little impact from the new additions to the list. But the price cuts for FY17 could see Rs.100 crore worth of sales (4% of previous years sales) getting affected, according to Nomura.GSK Pharma is investing sizeable sums in expanding capacity. Its existing factory in Nashik has been upgraded and a new Rs.1,000 crore facility is being built in Karnataka. The new facility will be commissioned by end-FY17 or early-FY18 and should double capacity. This capacity will play a key role in driving the companys growth in existing products while new ones will play their role tooit has launches planned in respiratory, diabetes and vaccines segments in the next three years. It will also minimize its exposure to drugs under price control.The presentation does paint a picture of a company readying for a growth push and GSK Pharma has also indicated that margins will get back to the 18-20% levels in the next two-three years, according to Nomura. The start-up of the new factory may hit margins in the near term, till it stabilizes and reaches optimal capacity levels.If all goes according to plan, one should see GSK Pharmas sales growth recover in the current fiscal year and beyond. The fall in its share price then raises the question if a bounce can be around the corner. Nomura does not think so, maintaining a reduce rating on the stock, citing its valuation of 59 times its price-to-earnings ratio based on FY17 projected earnings. It attributes this relatively high valuation to expectations of the parent making a delisting bid.",2016-08-26,k49G6DMVZvneOck6Bn7NKK,"In the June quarter, sales grew by 8% to Rs685 crore, but price cuts took away Rs20 crore in sales, and supply constraints took away Rs55 crore

-0.97,"Moscow/London: Two years ago, the Kremlins oil flagship was foundering, hit by falling prices and international sanctions just as it faced $20 billion in debt payments.
				   
				Short of cash, Rosneft got about $15 billion of emergency aid with help from the central bank. But the deal spooked investors, requiring a massive rate increase to stem market turmoil. Chief executive officer Igor Sechin, the man Vladimir Putin had for a decade relied on to build Rosneft into a giant, faced rare disfavour from his patron, senior officials said at the time.Now, Putin is turning to Rosneft for help. Sechins energy colossus is helping fill a yawning budget gap at home and support the Kremlin abroad. The companys turnaround is a triumph for the Russian president, who vowed to protect the pillars of his state-dominated system from US and European Union pressure when they were slapped with sanctions two years ago.Russia is among dozens of petro-states that are learning to make do with less as oil prices show no signs of major recovery. For some, like Saudi Arabia, the rout has provided an added impetus for economic overhauls, while othersincluding Putins Russiathe priority has been to paper over cracks with short-term fixes that dont reduce their reliance on petroleum.Also Read: Rosneft buy of Bashneft gives impetus to privatization: Vladimir PutinIts very important to the Kremlin that Rosneft is a strong company, said James Henderson, a former banker who is now a senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. Russias foreign policy as much as domestic policy relies on it.Shopping spreeJust last week, Rosneft spent 330 billion rubles ($5 billion) to buy control of another oil company from the government, the biggest privatization deal yet this year. Then Putin backed a plan under which Rosneft could provide an even bigger cash infusion, spending as much as $11 billion to buy a chunk of its own shares from the government. On 15 October, it announced a deal to buy a big refinery and other assets in India, under which it will pay $3.5 billion for a 49% stake. Putin presided over the signing of that agreement on a visit to Goa, confirming that Rosneft remains a favoured Kremlin tool for binding political ties with business links.Even Putin seemed surprised at Rosnefts recovery. At a meeting with budget officials, he said hed instructed the appropriate agencies to check that Rosneft had the funds on its accounts and wouldnt need to borrow to make the payments to the government.The Kremlin, too, has managed to weather the worst of the pain so far, thanks to billions in petrodollars saved up when oil prices were high, the sharp devaluation of the ruble and help from China and other friends outside the West. His economy steadying, Putin shows no sign of softening his confrontational approach to the US and Europe. Hes pushing his advantage in Syria, moving new missiles to Europes borders and, according to US intelligence, deploying hackers to meddle in the presidential elections.The key to Rosnefts turnaroundeven as oil prices have languishedwas a combination of financial engineering, the weakened ruble, political support and a little help from some friends: billions of dollars in advance payments from buyers in China. Rosnefts cash pile stood at more than $22 billion at the end of the second quarter, almost double what it had early last year.A Rosneft spokesman didnt respond to a request for comment for this article.Once an also-ran made up of the scraps of the Soviet oil industry that the 1990s oligarchs didnt want, Rosnefts fortunes turned as Putin moved to restore Kremlin control of the strategic sector in the early 2000s. He installed fellow intelligence veteran Sechin to lead the company in 2004. Rosneft took over the bulk of Yukos, a company the government seized from Putin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky. In 2013 Rosneft became the largest publicly traded oil producer on the planet when it purchased TNK-BP, a venture of the British company and a trio of Russian billionaires, for more than $50 billion. It borrowed more than $30 billion for that deal, one of the largest-ever financings by a Russian company.But soon after the TNK-BP deal, Rosnefts proximity to Putin became a liability.Also Read: Will Rosneft deal benefit Essar Oil shareholders?Eager to hit the Russian leader in his pocketbook after the March 2014 annexation of Crimea, the US announced sanctions targeting Sechin, citing his utter loyalty to Vladimir Putin. Later, the US and EU slapped limits on Rosneft, restricting access to technology and capital markets. Igor sanctionForeign lenders whod once battled for Rosnefts favour couldnt do business with it. BPs CEO joked that Sechins new nickname was Igor Sanction.By that fall, Rosneft was again walloped as oil fell below $100. Soon, it was asking the Kremlin for a $43 billion rescue. Putin balked at the huge sum, which was nearly as big as the bailouts the largest US banks got back in 2009 and would have used up much of one of Russias two sovereign wealth funds.The crisis of 2014 made investors panic, said Oleg Popov, a Moscow money manager who owns Rosnefts bonds. It was a perfect storm.But just days before a $7 billion payment to western banks came due in December 2014, Rosneft got its lifeline. Through a complicated series of transactions that stretched over several months, it issued 1 trillion rubles in bonds that a local bank used as collateral to borrow as much as $15 billion from the Russian central bank to lend on to the oil giant. The state bank that came up with the scheme couldnt participate because of sanctions, so Rosneft took the idea to another lender, according to a person familiar with the deals. Apparently fearful the US could extend the restrictions to squeeze the institution involved, Rosneft kept the nature of the deal a secret.But when word of the bond issue leaked out, its huge size alarmed local investors, who dumped the ruble.Only an emergency 6.5-percentage-point rate hike and heavy Kremlin pressure on exporters to sell foreign currency were enough to stabilize the exchange rate. Sechin publicly denied any role in the rubles plunge, threatening to deal with provocateurs who alleged the company was involved. Rosnefts London-traded shares dropped to the lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis.Putin criticismThe botched bailout angered top officials including Putin, people familiar with the situation said at the time. Sechin faced a rare public criticism from the president in a late-night meeting. A prominent Moscow newspaper editor tweeted that rumors were swirling among the capitals elite gathered at the Bolshoi Theater for a ballet premiere that Sechin was about to be fired. Rosneft denied it.Sechin tried to make amends, selling tens of billions of dollars earned from oil sales to buy rubles, helping steady the currency. He cut capital spending. To raise cash, the company pitched stakes in major Siberian projects to investors in China and India.The plunging ruble became a blessing, lowering Rosnefts costs in dollar terms and cushioning the blow of low oil prices, since crude is sold in dollars. A fifty-dollar barrel is worth 53% more, in ruble terms, today than it was two years ago.Also Read: Essar Oil-Rosneft deal likely to escape capital gains tax due to Mauritius treatyFurther relief came when customersnever publicly identified by Rosneft, but assumed by analysts to be led by state-controlled China National Petroleum Corp.made $15 billion in prepayments for future crude supplies in the third quarter of 2015. By early this year, Sechin had reclaimed his traditional position in Putins good books, touting Rosnefts results in a personal meeting with the leader. He also installed a veteran executive whod built up government connections during a stint as a deputy energy minister, Pavel Fedorov, as his de-facto No. 2.Rosnefts market capitalization topped that of Gazprom, the state gas monopoly and its traditional rival for political affections, for the first time in April. BP, which owns a 20% stake in Rosneft, reported that its share of the Russian companys profits last year contributed almost a quarter of its earnings, the largest share ever. In June, Sechin said he thought his company could be worth as much as $130 billion, twice its current value and more than BP. Crude production would be up after several years of declines, he said.By accidentOver the last year, we cut our debt load in half, he told state television. For a company like ours thats under sanctions, thats a brilliant result, he added. Topping the market-capitalization ranks of Russian companies just happened by accident, he said with a smile.Still, investors have cause for skepticism. In its presentations, Rosneft doesnt count the billions of dollars of pre-payments as debt. Rating agencies believe it should, since the company has to repay them, with interest, in oil. When the prepayments are included, Rosneft had reduced its net debt since 2013 by only about $6 billion as of the end of the second quarter, according to Alexey Bulgakov, an analyst at Sberbank-CIB in Moscow. That compares with the companys claim to have cut net debt by more than $22 billion over the period.S&P Global Ratings this month called Rosnefts financial policy aggressive, warning that future acquisitions could lead debt to spike.The company faces as much as $16 billion in debt repayments before the end of next year, including the bulk of the central-bank facility, which the regulator is eager to see repaid, according to officials. At the same time, Rosneft still is pumping money into projects in Venezuela, where the business outlook is murky at best but the Kremlin is eager to maintain political ties.Goldman Sachs this week cut Rosneft shares to neutral from buy, warning that the company could start diverting its cash to value-eroding M&A.Political controlEven Rosnefts plan to buy its own shares is in part a reflection of weakness. The government efforts to find other buyers for the 19.5% stake it wants to unload have fallen flat, leaving Rosneft itself as the acquirer of last resort. Real privatization would happen at a later date, with Rosneft reselling it to unspecified outside investors at higher prices, Putin told reporters on the trip to India last weekend. On that visit, a jacket-less Sechin was sighted playing pool with the head of a state bank during a break in the talks. (Sechin won.)Concerns about the giant companys efficiency were among the reasons Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and senior members of his cabinet cited in opposing Rosnefts bid for Bashneft, the company Rosneft bought in the privatization this month. They argued the sale should be used to boost the private sector. But Rosneft offered as much as $1 billion more than rival bidders and after months of mixed signals, Putin ruled against his officials, saying he was a bit surprised theyd ever been opposed.The current leadership believes that political control is more important than market efficiency, said Edward Chow, a former Chevron executive who is now a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

-0.63,"Singapore: Monday evenings coup at Bombay House, the headquarters of Indias steel-to-software conglomerate Tata, was as swift as it was abrupt.
				   
				Not only did the board of Tata Sons, the holding company, dump Cyrus Mistry as chairman after less than four years, it also brought back Ratan Tata, 78, as the interim boss, leaving nobody in any doubt that the founding family of the 148-year-old empire was reasserting control.But what made Tata reach for the nuclear option?The companys brief statement gave no clues, though conspiracy theories range from Mistrys futile attempts at micro-managing a maddening potpourri of companies, to not having a nose for talent (a six-member executive council put together by him was also disbanded), and selling the family silver to pay down debt when he should have focused more on growth.Investors in Tatas suite of operating companies were picking up signs of discord, but were still unprepared for a coup. After all, Ratan Tata seemed to be nothing less than delighted when a selection committee tasked to find his successor returned from a 15-month global hunt with the idea that Mistry  a member of the search panel as well as the son of a large shareholder  was the best choice. If the 48-year-old executive is now being removed for being out of his depth, the more experienced Ratan Tata deserves some blame for putting him in that position in the first place.Also Read: Understanding the Tata Sons boardroom coupBesides, its not clear that Mistry was doing a lousy job. Start the clock in late August 2004, when the IPO of software business Tata Consultancy created the group as it exists today. In the subsequent eight years that Tata guided the behemoth, a market capitalization-weighted index of its 26 listed units barely managed to beat the Sensex. Over a shorter time frame, Mistry has outperformed the benchmark more convincingly.When it comes to future returns, though, Ratan Tata may have reasons to be anxious about the direction in which Mistry was steering the ship.Tata took advantage of a China-fueled boom in commodity demand to load up on debt, which led to an eightfold expansion in the annual net income of the groups publicly traded companies in the six years through 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But with overcapacity in the Peoples Republic hitting the groups steel business hard, profitability waned.In wanting to reduce leverage by selling everything from money-losing UK steel operations to coal mines in Indonesia and hotels in the US, Mistry has veered too far away from his predecessors expansionist strategy. With the pace of capital expenditure down to a 12-month run rate of $2 billion versus $3.7 billion in Tatas final year at the helm, the group runs the risk of courting irrelevance. Also Read: Cyrus Mistry ouster could slow Tata groups debt reduction processMore worrisome, from a Tata perspective, is that the group nowadays makes news mostly for the wrong reasons. Whether its an almost $1 billion jury award against its software unit for a US intellectual-property infringement case, or the embarrassment of losing a $1.17 arbitration brought against Tata Sons by NTT Docomo for alleged failure to honour a partnership contract, the conglomerates reputation for good corporate citizenship has taken a beating.Its hard to say if Mondays putsch will fix everything from strategic wobbles to PR snafus. Investors will want to see if the mutiny leads to a bounty in the form of superior shareholder returns. That depends mainly on whether the search panel gets lucky this time around. Pending the induction of the new chairman, however, what matters is how operating companies  and their bosses  react to Ratan Tatas return.For now, palace intrigue looks unlikely to affect performance.

0.46,"Mumbai: Tata Motors Ltd, which had launched the countrys first compressed natural gas (CNG) bus fleet, is planning to commercially roll out eco-friendly liquefied natural gas (LNG) bus by April next year. 
				   
				The company had made a pilot-run for the nations first LNG powered bus in Thiruvananthapuram last week and hopes to launch first in Kerala. The company had unveiled the first LNG truck at the Delhi Auto Expo 2014. If all goes well, we are planning the commercial launch next April. We are working overtime to get regulatory approvals including those from Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), Tata Motors engineering head Ajit Jindal said. He, however, denied the plans that the company has inked an agreement with Kerala. We have not signed any agreement with Kerala as yet or any other state. Kerala is keen to place an order for 1,000 buses with us and we have offered to make 10% of that (100) to be LNG-powered, Jindal said. He said these fully-built buses will be produced at its Lucknow plant, where it makes the CNG buses also, and the body will be built at its Dharwar plant. Going forward, if the demand is good, we can also offer just chassis, he said. When asked about the advantages of LNG over CNG in terms ownership cost for a customer, he said there is no significant cost advantage over CNG, but coastal states can gain considerably from fuel transportation cost. From the point of view of diesel, the gains are huge as cost of ownership will be cheaper by around 30%, while acquisition cost may be higher by Rs4-5 lakh, he added. In terms of ease of usage, the LNG buses offer a great advantage over CNG variants as the dead weight of a CNG cylinder and that of a cryogenic cylinder is huge apart from very low filling time, he said. With a full tank, an LNG bus can run as much as 700 km in one filling, while a CNG bus can at best deliver just about 200 km per cylinder, Jindal said. He also said an LNG-powered bus (Tata LPO1613) is lighter in weight compared to buses powered by conventional fuels and has enhanced levels of payload.Jindal said they have not spent too much on developing this bus which will be sold initially as fully built units of 9 meters or 35 seaters, and 12 meters or 50 seaters, the engines are same as that of its CNG buses. About fuel supply, Jindal said the company is talking to Petronet LNG Ltd and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd to set up special filling stations. But again, he said, no agreement has been reached between them.

-0.25,"Singapore: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds entry into the telecom space is set to change the composition of the Indian economy, and its impact will be felt across all sectors, and investors should look at companies that are set to benefit from this communications revolution, said Mark Mobius, executive chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets Group at Franklin Templeton Investments.
				   
				Mobius, who oversees the Templeton research team based in 18 global emerging markets offices, said he would give high marks for the performance of the Narendra Modi government so far. He cautioned that after  the passage of reforms, the focus would shift to implementation.We have got to see implementation of those reforms so that the economy can grow and accelerate and continue on the high growth rate. So, I would say India offers an opportunity and a pitfall, and we have to keep an eye out for it, he added in an interview.Edited excerpts: India has recently seen three big reforms over the past few monthsthe goods and services tax, a relaxation in foreign direct investment norms and the bankruptcy law being passed. As an investor, how do you view these steps? Are these the last of the big reforms from the Modi government?All those steps are very good and the tax one is excellent. Now, what has to be done is implementation, because implementation with each state is really the key going forward. So, we have to look and see how fast implementation can take place, because that will determine the success of this reform. But, we are very excited about these changes, and the impact, of course, will be far-reaching, and will really be very dramatic going forward. Thats really the key, because we must not overlook the fact that implementation is probably more difficult. Getting passed in Parliament is one thing, but getting each state to implement it, to reduce the bureaucracy, to make things more efficientthat is really the key to success.The perception among investors outside is that the Indian markets are expensive. We are very excited about the Indian market. If you look at global firms, youll notice that India rating has been increasing. We are definitely very focused on India. Growth rate is very high, and we believe that this will continue with the reforms that we have seen, and so we are quite excited about it.Which are the sectors in the Indian market that you are excited about?First one, of course, is techsoftware, in particular, is very good for us. Secondly, it is the consumer sector and, particularly with the tax reform, I believe that the consumer sector will really surge ahead. Also, the companies and industries that will benefit from the revolution in communications with RILs (Reliance Industries Ltds) entry into telecoms, they are going to make telecommunicationsdatacheaper for everyone in India. This will set off a revolution in innovation and, I believe, companies that can benefit from that will really be the ones that you would want to look at. A lot of that will be consumer-oriented.How do you see RILs entry into telecoms? Will it be a game changer?No question about it. It is going to be a game changer. By bringing down the cost of the telecoms, and by enabling people to utilize telecommunications in a bigger way, cheaper, faster and more efficient way, the entire composition of the economy will change. This goes for the financial sector, it goes for the consumer sector, even goes for the industrial sectorso, everybody will be impacted by this. Its true that the competition has been hurt temporarily with RILs entry, but I think they will step up to the plate and be ready to compete.Which sectors in the Indian market should one avoid at this time?I think it is not avoidbut we have to be very cautious when it comes to the finance sector. As I mentioned, the changes that telecommunications and mobile will bring about to banking and transfer of moneythat is going to have a big impact on the financial sector. Those financial sector companies that are not able to keep up, they will be at a disadvantage. The other area is the companies that have benefited from the restrictionsstate restrictions, border control restrictions, tax restrictionsthese companies are going to be impacted soon, and we have to be very careful. Again, the companies which had state monopolies in certain areas because of the inability of competitors to come inthose companies are going to be impacted, too. So, we have to be careful about not picking these companies. Recently, in your blog, you had said while India is growing faster than China, the latter continues to be your top bet among emerging markets.Thats mainly because of the size of China. You have a lot of liquid and large companies in the China market, and access is easy through the Hong Kong market, which enables us to get in and out of Chinese companies. However, with these reforms in India, you will see the rating on India increase. If you see our global funds, you will see that happening already.Overall, how worried or optimistic are you on China?I am pretty optimistic about China. I know people are concerned about the debt, about the leverage, etc., but at the end of the day, it is a communist-controlled society, and they can control the heavy leverage that a lot of the companies have. As you know, the big banks and big companies there are all controlled by the government... Its a big economygrowth is continuing not only because of government spending, but also because of private sector growth. So, were optimistic. But in a country like that, just like in India, there will be winners and losers. We have to be very careful in stock selection.In a recent blog, you said that in 2016, emerging markets have outperformed developed markets in US dollar terms. What is your take on the mid-term and long-term performance of emerging markets equities when compared with the developed markets?In the long term, there is no question that emerging markets will outperform for the simple reason that economic growth in emerging markets will continue to be at least double that of the developed countries. So, as long as that is the case, we can expect emerging markets to outperform. If you look at history, there is a correlation between market performance and economic growth. So, thats an important point to keep in mind. The other thing is that there is a slew of frontier marketscountries that are just starting out in the market economy adventure and these companies and countries will be growing at a very fast pace because theyre starting from a low base. That also will boost emerging markets generally.How do you see the emerging markets being impacted by the gradual increase in US interest rates?Its very important to look at the history of interest rates and emerging markets performance. If you compare the US Feds funds rate against the emerging markets performance, there is no real correlation. For example, the period between 1988 and 1993, interest rates went down and the emerging markets went up. Everybody expects a correlation between interest rates and performance; but then, if you look at the period from 2003 to 2007, interest rates went up and the emerging markets boomed. From 2007-09, the correlation held because interest rates went down and the emerging markets went down. So, its different from what you would expect. I think people are putting too much weight on the interest rate, particularly the US Federal Reserve rate and what the markets will do. There is a good chance that if the US Fed raises the interest rate, then emerging markets could outperform. You just cannot say that when interest rates go up, the market goes down. It doesnt work that way. History shows thats not the case.How do you rate the performance of the Modi government so far? Do you think it has delivered on many of its promises in terms of reforms, in terms of ease of doing business?I think there was too much euphoria when they were elected, and we foresaw that they would have difficulty in the beginning. So, we didnt expect the tremendous surge of reforms because we knew the barriers that they were facing in Parliament and so forth. However, the fact that they have been able to pass the tax reform and that they have been able to make changes is very heartening to us. To us, it indicates that the Modi government has done a pretty good job. I would have like to see (former Reserve Bank of India governor) Raghuram Rajan to stay on in the central bank. That is probably one negative to the Modi government; but then, if his successor continues on the same policies in a quiet way, then it should be OK. I would say we would give them high marks for performance.In India, what do you feel are the challenges and risks going forward?Again, it is not just the degree to which reform takes place. We have got to see implementation of those reforms so that the economy can grow and accelerate and continue on the high growth rate. So, I would say India offers an opportunity and a pitfall, and we have to keep an eye out for it.How do you see the private equity space in South-East Asia?Its very good. It is a great opportunity here in South-East Asia because there are so many new enterprises that are getting started and, of course, the impact of China on South-East Asia, in most parts, is very positive. China is, of course, the main trading partner, and as China surges ahead, these countries will be pulled along with them.

-1.0,"New York: IBM Corp. is teaming up with Slack Technologies Inc. to make it easier for companies to build custom chatbots into the start-ups workplace-messaging systems, the latest move by Big Blue to add more diverse business cases for its Watson artificial-intelligence technology.
				   
				The two companies will release a developer toolkit that includes Watson technologies and can integrate easily into Slack, they said in a statement Wednesday. International Business Machines Corp. will also build a chatbota conversation-based applicationthat will help IT departments identify and resolve issues without having to leave the Slack platform. The start-ups own customer-service bot will incorporate the Watson Conversation system, which includes technologies such as speech-to-text conversion and natural-language processing, or the ability for a computer to understand what a person is saying.Right now, if you say something to Slackbot in Slack, it will kind of blindly take what you ask it and do a search, Slack chief executive officer Stewart Butterfield said. The bot tries to match the query to a preset document and doesnt have any AI technologies helping it decode the meaning of the question. With Watsons technology, the system will better understand and learn about the way users ask about things and will collect better results, he said.Sending messages using applications such as Slack or Facebook Inc.s WhatsApp or Messenger has become an attractive communication method for both consumers and companies, leading to a boom in chatbots. Businesses are eager to interact with their customers on these platforms using bots, which can provide direct contact without requiring them to hire a bunch of customer-service representatives or salespeople to do the leg work.A virtual agent that can answer questions and synthesize large reams of data is useful because its a faster way to get people the right answer versus going through files and finding it themselves, said David Kenny, general manager at IBM Watson. It enables people to work with machines the way they work with each otherits a more natural way to work.Bot expertiseArmonk, New York-based IBM has come across a number of old and new clients that are creating these kinds of conversational bots, building them from various Watson technologiesputting them together like Lego blocks. To make it easier for companies to build chatbots, IBM has also combined the relevant blocks to create a new service, Watson Virtual Agent, according to a separate statement. Companies using this service can pick a specific focus for the bots expertise, such as retail, and can train it using internal proprietary data, Kenny said.The push in chatbots is IBMs latest move to add more artificial intelligence to software, an extension of its overall bet that companies will pay for AI products that can automate business processes. The suite of Watsons AI services is key to IBMs strategy to drive growth in software sales, especially as demand ebbs for older products.About 30,000 IBM employees use Slacks messaging system, making it one of the San Francisco start-ups biggest customers. The goal of the new partnership for both companies is to use AI to quickly provide insights from the huge data sets collected by the messaging system, yet require a lot of processing power to analyse. Each Slack customer, for example, has archived messages about everything from human-resources questions to sales data to network issues, all information that can be fed to an artificial intelligence machine that can be used to advise people on later inquiries and problemsvia, say, a chatbot interface. Both companies agree that theyre at the beginning stages of building new technology that can achieve that vision.Its hard to overestimate the degree of difficulty or depths we have to go to, Butterfield said. IBM has huge investments in this area and they have a great idea of the opportunities.",2016-10-26,kMXUqXsejAjHN5tUKKGM5H,IBM will build a chatbota conversation-based applicationthat will help IT departments identify and resolve issues without having to leave the Slack platform,competitor,16:51,IBM teams up with Slack to build smarter data-crunching chatbots
0.34,"State Bank of India (SBI) suffered a 32% drop in its net profit for the June quarter but still came out looking like a star because the other six public sector banks that reported their financials on Friday came out with terrible results, with five suffering huge losses.
				   
				The SBI stock ran up 7%, despite the 32% drop in its net profit to Rs.2,520.96 crore. Lets get to the good parts first. The growth in operating profit was 20.12% at Rs.11,504 crore, not to be sneezed at. In terms of provisions, fresh slippages and even operating expenses, the June quarter was better than the previous one. Total provisions dropped by 43.7%, fresh slippages or the loans that turned bad during the June quarter also dropped by a huge 70% to Rs.8,790 crore.The fact that gross bad loans rose by a modest 3.43% gives relief. It looks like much of the pain has passed, with gross non-performing assets (NPAs) at 6.94% of total loans amid declining slippages. Most now expect a further fall in slippages in the quarters ahead.The other six lenders reported gross bad loan ratios exceeding 11%.SBIs net interest income, or the core income a bank earns by giving loans, rose 4.23% to Rs.14,312.31 crore in the June quarter. Other income increased 44.16% to Rs.7,335.08 crore from Rs.5,087.98 crore in the same period last year. Indeed, we should not write off the banks performance at a time when the end of the bad loan tunnel looks even farther after other banks results.But this glow vanishes once we begin looking at the red flags. In the analyst meet after the release of the results, SBI chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya said the loan watch list still stands at Rs.31,000 crore. These are loans that the bank expects most likely to turn bad. The lender had indicated the figure of Rs.31,000 crore in the quarter ended March. Although Bhattacharya did not reiterate or give an indication as to how much of it is prone to slip, the banks most conservative estimate is 30%.In the June quarter, Rs.2,165 crore worth of slippages was from the watch list. The bank has added a similar amount this quarter and these additions come from a new territory, the international loan book. The situation is far from rosy, said Bhattacharya at the analyst meet.It is clear that other income saved the day. The 44.16% increase in other income cushioned the impact of the rise in provisions on profits. But sample this: operating profit increased by Rs.1,852 crore from a year ago, while the rise in profit on sale of investments was Rs.1,851 crore. The entire increase in operating profit was therefore on account of these profits. And such profits are prone to market vagaries and do not come every quarter. All it takes is a reversal in the trend of bond yields.The banks stock has outperformed the PSU Bank Nifty, with SBI rising 29% as against the PSU Bank Niftys gain of 23% in the last three months. Given its results compared with the others, the outperformance should continue.The writer does not hold positions in the companies discussed here.",2016-08-12,kMpioq0U6DKPvwNnW8YhSN,"SBI suffered a 32% drop in Q1 profit but still came out looking like a star as the other six public sector banks that reported results on Friday came out with terrible results

During the quarter, the benchmark Singapore complex margin increased by $1.5 per barrel sequentially to $6.7 per barrel. RILs revenue from the refining segment was up at 7.5% at Rs61,693 crore.RIL is the operator of the worlds biggest oil-refinery complex with a refining capacity of 1.24 million barrels of oil per day, located at Jamnagar in Gujarat.The companys petrochemicals business sprang a surprise. Analysts had expected the segment to show weaker numbers on the back of falling margins and demonetization.Segment revenue in the petrochemicals business grew 17.8% to Rs22,584 crore. Earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) grew faster at 25.5%. As a result, the petrochemical margin was a better-than-expected 14.4%, up 80 basis points from a year ago.

Historically, C&B has grown at nearly 15% and Pidilite is striving to achieve it, the management said in a post-earnings conference call. It isnt surprising that the stock has fallen 5.45% in the last three trading sessions. Industrial segment saw volumes grow 12.7% y-o-y. While C&B margins fell, industrial business saw improvement on that front courtesy lower input costs, superior product mix and higher sales of speciality products. Margins of the industrial segment were in the teens and will sustain, the management added. Among acquisitions, the performance of Bluecoat, Falcofix and Percept remains on track, but waterproofing business Nina had a soft quarter due to heavy rains. International business was largely impacted by voluntary recall of products in the US. But that issue is now behind Pidilite and new products were dispatched towards the latter part of September.Meanwhile, gross margins improved due to softer raw material costs, but consolidated Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margin fell, hit by other expenses led by higher advertisement costs.

0.37,"Cigarette firms are stopping production, apparently in protest against the governments decision not to withdraw new graphic health warnings. This development could worry investors as lost output may lead to lost sales. Since the deadline was known, firms are likely to have stocked up in advance to ensure retail sales are not affected. The bigger worry for investors should be if these warnings are implemented and they lead to a further drop in cigarette consumption.
				   
				The new norms, in effect from 1 April, require cigarette firms to display a graphic warning that covers 85% of the cigarette pack on both sides from the current 40%. A parliamentary committee had recently submitted recommendations for a lower area of 50% to be covered, according to news reports. Since the government has not said anything yet, the new guidelines have taken effect. ITC Ltd says it is unprepared for the change and is stopping production.If this is a pressure tactic, the companies may keep output shut for long. If not, then companies will change their packaging and resume production. After all, this change has been in the works for long.Investors will be puzzled if this becomes a long-drawn affair. After all, analysts have said that most cigarettes in India are sold loose; so packets and their warnings are not that big a problem. In fact, a ban on loose cigarettes is what had them worried, and there is no sign of that happening. Therefore, the impact should be minimal.But it may not be that simple. Even if loose sale is not banned, the packs themselves are visible on shelves even now, making a bigger warning more visible. The portion of smokers who do buy packs may be influenced by bigger warnings.That brings us to the last question. Do bigger warnings really matter to smokers? They can already read them on the packs now. Global studies conclude that graphic warnings do play a role in reducing cigarette consumption. The Global Adult Tobacco Survey, prepared by the World Health Organization (WHO), states that the number of people thinking of quitting smoking due to health warnings has increased from 46.3% in 2008 to 53% in 2012. In India, in 2010, 28.6% were considering quitting smoking due to these warnings. If a pictorial warning more than doubles in size, this percentage may increase.Of course, thinking of quitting and actually quitting are two different things. However, concerted efforts to reduce smoking may work. The WHOs 2015 global report on trends in the prevalence of tobacco smoking says that Indias smoking population was 13% in 2010 and if tobacco control efforts continue at the same intensity then WHO projects that this will come down to 8% in 2025.That should be a worry for the industry.The immediate impact may be negligible as companies may already have inventory to sell. Eventually, if the government remains firm, companies will have to sell cigarettes with the new packs. After some years, the impact of the size and type of warnings can be assessed. Just as investors in cigarette stocks were relieved that the increase in excise duties was manageable, a new problem has landed at their doorstep.",2016-04-04,l7DQyNheesgzgsezHcBeGI,"Just as investors in cigarette stocks were relieved that the increase in excise duties was manageable, a new problem has landed at their doorstep

1.0,"The most fundamental progress that technology has made over the past few decades is a dramatic increase in computing power coupled with a reduction in the cost of storage. Such progress has enabled us to run algorithms and code over swathes of data and at a fraction of the cost, thus yielding what some may consider more insights. Consequently, we are able to find patterns in large amounts of data. 
				   
				This, by some limited definition, is construed as intelligence and has been demonstrated in specific classes of activities such as detecting diabetes from retinal scans, driving cars, playing games, etc. In these cases, software can emulate human behaviour and perhaps even exceed human capabilities. But the fact is that we have not yet invented any new magic wand to make software think on its own or have any sense of consciousness, in the way humans do.The limitation is grounded in the fact that software still operates, for the most part, on the paradigm of Gigo (garbage in garbage out), meaning it mostly only does whatever we tell it to and is biased, based on whatever data we train it with. Give it incorrect data and it will pick up incorrect patterns.But the vision and aspiration of computer science has always been to build a machine that can accurately emulate human intelligence. However, we still have a long way to go before we can build a software system that is functionally capable the same way a human is. Software intelligence, though defined in academic circles, has been fairly misused (and misunderstood) in popular reporting, giving people the impression that software can do just about anything a human being can. This notion is fundamentally misguided. We are not there. Or at least not yet. The gap between software and the human mind is still massive.Consequently such gaps do not necessarily support claims that artificial intelligence (AI) and automation will replace hordes of jobs in the Indian IT industry and ultimately lead to mass unemployment. This industry employs provides direct employment for a few million people in India, a significant fraction of whom belong to our expanding middle class. Therefore, as various commentators have begun to call out the threat of automation to this industry there is considerable (and reasonable) fear whether the rise of machines spells doom and gloom for a section of the Indian middle class.But I do not believe we are there yet. Or at least not to the extent people fear. Automating away this labour force is not an easy task. Terms like robotic automation are not sufficient replacement for the complexity and range of tasks that this labour force performs. It is very tempting to prognosticate a future where silicon (computers) will rule supreme over carbon (humans). However, as a computer scientist, through my work and study over the past few years in the IT/technology industry and about how businesses consume technology, I have gained a genuine appreciation for the unique value and contributions human beings bring to the table in building trust and enabling businesses the world over. Automating these unique attributes with machines will necessarily require emulating the same value humans deliver in businesses.The role of professionals in the IT industry, the populace whose work is under threat from automation, has not yet been sufficiently understood nor has it been given its due credit. These professionals perform a range of activities, from understanding customers business requirements to writing code, maintaining software systems and processing transactions. Working in teams, they perform a variety of different actions touching several information systems, coordinate with each other, navigate uncertain or changing scenarios, report to their managers, take bottomline responsibilities for their respective systems, are accountable and serve customers across the globe. All these activities engender a deep sense of trust and confidence among their customers the world over.But this is also true for each individual. All humans, I argue, even in the most seemingly robotic tasks bring to bear abilities that do not make them merely robotic. Conceptually every human being has a brain stack comprised of layers that include the ability to execute deterministic tasks, intuition, experience, handling (unexpected) variations, common sense, and an ability to identify and fix the unusual. These are fundamental traits that all humans share, though, admittedly, some more than others. No matter the task each human has the potential and ability to apply these traits in any situation without necessarily being to do so a priori. It is a combination of these traits inherent to each one of us that engenders trust and confidence in us among our colleagues. All businesses run on such trust and confidence in their stakeholders  be they employees or vendors. Therefore, attempting to replace any human with a robotic system is akin to trying to hire a human being who can only ever execute deterministic tasks but lacks intuition, common sense, experience, and an ability to handle unusual situations!Hence, any attempt by intelligent software at automating all that work done by a single individual or an entire team of humans must involve recreating the same trust and confidence. This, in-turn, necessarily requires addressing the whole gamut of these activities that humans perform on a regular basis and with similar human traits, but in software.Therefore, the next stage of innovation in computer science will be not just to make software run faster but also about how to get software to emulate more human-like traits and ultimately become truly trustworthy (like humans).Rohan Murty is junior fellow at the Society of Fellows at Harvard University.This is part of a series of articles in Mints 10th anniversary special issue that look at India 10 years from now.

				Oil marketing companies Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) are set to begin sales of such cylinders with 30,000 units initially.The cylinders will be launched in Maharashtra and Gujarat, to begin with, three senior officials from the OMCs said. We are seeking composite liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders to be included in the LPG control order. As soon as that is done, we will be launching the product, a senior HPCL official said on condition of anonymity. Given that this is a new category, the official said, either the LPG control order that regulates the supply and distribution of LPG needs to be amended or a special dispensation has to be made.The OMCs are, however, sceptical about sales picking up significantly, given the high costs. Composite cylinders are expensive. A consumer will have to pay nearly Rs3,000 per cylinder. At this cost, customer acquisition will be very difficult.

Re-fill costs will be in line with those of a 5kg steel cylinder. An advantage of transparent gas cylinders is consumers can be assured of the quantity of gas.

-0.32,"Bengaluru: In India, for the price of the latest iPhone, you could eat breakfast, lunch and dinner for an entire year, and still have a bit of cash to spare.
				   
				Needless to say, at about Rs70,000 ($1,030) for a mid-range model, the iPhone 7 is a luxury item in the country of 1.3 billion. After Apple revealed the price last year, Indians had a field day on social media. One of the most-shared posts was a (fake) picture of an owner of a brand-new iPhone with a missing kidney.Its no secret that Apple is eager for a chunk of the worlds fastest-growing smartphone market. So far, its been a challenge. Last year, the Cupertino, California-based company shipped a total of 2.5 million iPhones in India, a small fraction of the 29 million smartphones that Samsung sold. Unlike Apple, the South Korean handset maker has an array of products designed for the market, including a smartphone that starts at $65.In fact, many Indians who want an iPhone wait for new models to launchnot because they want the latest one, but because prices of older versions will drop, making them more affordable. A stroll through the market might even convince you that the iPhone 5S, which was released in 2013, is Apples hottest product in India. There are posters telling buyers to upgrade to the 5S, even though its already been phased out of some markets.Also Read: Apple woos new iPhone fans as current owners await upgradeThey retail in cramped stores in the smallest towns and cities, drawing crowds eager to own a bit of Apple magic. Storekeepers will usually try to entice people to buy newer, affordable smartphones from Oppo, Vivo and other hyper-aggressive Chinese brands. Sometimes it works, but more often the shopper will opt for a 5S, asking the shop to transfer data and contacts into the phone, along with a few Bollywood hit songs.This is why Apple is eager to push deeper into India and open stores so that it can sell both used and new iPhones, and get a generation of India consumers hooked on its products. Apple needs a new growth engine; the companys results for the last three months of 2016, out just this week, showed sales growth in every region except China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. On a visit to India last year, Apple CEO Tim Cook wore a tilak on his forehead, draped an Indian silk stole over his shoulders and prayed to Ganapati, the elephant-headed god who is known as the remover of obstacles.At stake is more than 750 million devices that will be sold by 2020, according to Counterpoint Research. Right now, Apple and Narendra Modis government are locked in tough negotiations over whether the company can manufacture and sell phones in the country. While India is insisting that Apple procure 30% of its components locally (like any single-brand retailer in the country), Apple is pushing for a 15-year tax holiday on imports of components and equipment.The Chinese smartphone makers arent waiting: they have recruited movie stars and cricket players as brand ambassadors, while offering retailers bonuses for hitting sales targets. Smaller shops are blanketed with posters provided by Oppo, Vivo and Huawei. On Tuesdays earnings call, Cook said India is a great place to be. The only problem is, Apple isnt really there yet.

				After outside managers divvied up shipping magnate Sammy Ofers hundreds of tankers, container carriers, and other cargo vessels into two groups of equal value, sons Idan and Eyal each picked one out of a hat as their mother looked on.We literally reached in and grabbed an envelope, says the younger brother, Idan, 61. And thats it. It was peaceful, no drama. They did something similar with paintings by Picasso and Van Gogh and the rest of their fathers art collection. Other family assetsreal estate, bank shares, a stake in Israels biggest chemical companywere evenly divided based on the brothers involvement in the various businesses. Eyal, 66, took over Sammys stakes in Israels Mizrahi Tefahot Bank Ltd, property developer Melisron Ltd., real estate around the world, and a stake in Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Idan got control of Israels largest public holding company and various tech investments.ALSO READ: Indias middle-class billionairesIn terms of carving up colossal wealth, the Ofers did things as smoothly as possible. The brothers need look no further than their cousins Liora and Doron Ofer, the children of Sammys brother Yuli, to see how inheritance disputes can tear a family asunder. Those siblings are no longer on speaking terms after a legal squabble over Yulis stake in an investment company. Liora today controls assets valued at $2.3 billion, while Dorons share is $675 million, according to Bloomberg index calculations.Liora Ofer declined to comment for the story and Doron Ofer didnt respond to requests for comment. Eyal declined to be interviewed.Bad luck and differing appetites for risk, though, have turned Idan and Eyals equitable split into fortunes as lopsided as their cousins. Idans bank balance has been battered by a commodities slump, ill-timed investment bets, and increased scrutiny in Israel. Eyal, by contrast, has added to his wealth with office buildings and hotels across the US and Europe. When the split was finalized in 2013, both brothers were worth more than $6 billion. Idans stash has since dropped to $3 billion while the fortune of Eyal has grown to $8.6 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Tracking the value of his portfolio doesnt make me happy, Idan says, munching chocolate-covered rice cakes in his bright corner office in Londons Mayfair neighbourhood, where a large black-and-white photo of his bespectacled father peers over his shoulder. But Im used to it. And Im not a speculator. Having a background in shipping makes me comfortable with cyclical things.The brothers were born in Israel, then attended boarding school in Britain before returning home to fulfil their military service. After studying maritime law in London, Eyal worked alongside his father to expand the familys cargo shipping business. Idan, a 1982 graduate of the University of Haifa, chafed at the idea of sharing what he calls the same small office with his dad. He instead moved to Hong Kong and expanded the group into tankers.After a decade in Asia and a couple of years in New York, Idan was drawn back home. The family that owned a giant holding group called Israel Corp. Ltd was feuding and wanted to cash out. In 1999, the Ofers paid $330 million for a controlling interest in the company and Idan was appointed chairman. His homecoming was a coronation for the new prince of Israeli industry.That investment stands at the root of Idans declines. He now controls Israel Corp., whose primary asset is fertilizer giant Israel Chemicals Ltd. In 2008, filmmaker Miki Rosenthal released a documentary called The Shakshuka System, a reference to an Israeli dish of eggs and tomato sauce, which Rosenthal used as a metaphor for the Ofers relationship with politicians. The film says the Ofers used their close ties to government officials to buy state-owned companies on the cheap.Idan sued Rosenthal for libel in 2009 and the two parties settled out-of-court. Idan says he got no bargain on the companies, and that his restructuring netted the government more than $2 billion. Rosenthal, now a member of parliament with the Labour party, says Idan tried using false claims to scare and dissuade me from completing the film. Those efforts to prevent the movie from being shown aroused considerable curiosity, Rosenthal said in a statement.In 2011, middle-class Israelis took to the streets of Tel Aviv and other cities to protest the rising cost of living, often blaming the countrys business elite sometimes singling out Idan for their woes. In turn, the government hiked taxes on ICLs domestic profits and considered stripping the company of potash mines it operates near the Dead Sea.When Idan in 2012 sought to sell ICL to Potash Corp. for $13.5 billion, Israeli lawmakers torpedoed the deal, saying it was against the national interest. As the price of potash, ICLs most profitable product, has tumbled about 75% in the past eight years, the familys stake in Israel Corp.now controlled by Idanhas fallen below $1 billion, from $6.5 billion in 2008.Though Idan has since moved to London, where he oversees his empire, he doesnt link his move to the rising tensions in Israel. Im a citizen of the world, Idan says. It was time for a change.Eyal, meanwhile, has lived abroad since the 1970s and long ago minimized his role in Israel Corp., thereby skirting the tumult Idan faced. Over the years, he quietly assembled a real estate empire, starting with distressed properties on Park Avenue South in Manhattan. His deep knowledge of ships meant he was comfortable with similarly tangible (if less moveable) assets like buildings. By 1990, hed bought and sold more than 30 of them.Today, his portfolio includes more than 50 properties in four countries, ranging from a Travelodge hotel in London to splashy projects like a 43-story limestone tower on Manhattans Central Park West, where Goldman Sachs chief executive officer Lloyd Blankfein and rock star Sting live in palatial apartments that cost as much as $88 million apiece.Even as Eyal has gotten more ambitious as a developer, he has kept a remarkably low profile, says Richard Fain, chairman of Royal Caribbean Cruises, who has known Ofer for decades. Hes very focused on doing things that are right and will enhance the reputation of his family.Partners who work with Eyal describe him as disciplined and highly-involved, actively grooming his four children to take over the family business, much as his father did. William Rudin, CEO of New York developer Rudin Management Co. Inc., who teamed up with Eyal on a luxury condo project in Greenwich Village, says the next generation frequently attend meetings.Its a generational thing. Eyals kids refer to their father as chairman, says Richard Meade, managing editor at Lloyds List, a shipping industry journal. Discipline is very much his watchword.If Eyals side resembles a classic, patriarchal family business, Idans is more an assemblage of bold moonshots. Scott Borgerson, CEO of Boston-based investment firm CargoMetrics Technologies LLC, says thats what happens when one combines extreme wealth with an erudite man of disparate interests. Surrounded by society A-listers at a glitzy party in Saint-Tropez in August, the two sat late into the evening debating 18th-century British and American colonial history.I have a PhD on this and Idan was teaching me stuff, says Borgerson, whose company counts Idan as an investor. But under his intellectual curiosity he has a hard edge.Idan says real estate doesnt interest him and he avoids mature markets for their slow growth. He has backed power stations in India and Peru, a Chinese automaker, and a start-up that makes home-testing kits for urine. In 2007 he invested in Better Place, an electric-car charging station operator that soared to a valuation of $2 billion in 2011 but went bankrupt two years later.About the time Better Place was peaking, Idan gambled on an industry few but a risk-loving billionaire could afford: deepwater oil-drilling rigs. In late 2011 he listed Pacific Drilling SA on the New York Stock Exchange, which valued his 69% stake at $1.2 billion. The oil rout has since driven the stock price down 95%.Neither brother has been spared shippings historic bust. Since January, both brothers fleets have lost about $1 billion in value, according to researcher Vessels Value. That plunge, thanks to oversupply and anemic trade, might crush a smaller operator. But Eyal and Idanwho control the 20th and 25th biggest fleets in the world, Zodiac Group and Quantum Pacific Shippinghave the cash to withstand it, according to Vessels Value analyst William Bennett.Your survival in this market is your luck and having very deep pockets, Bennett says.The only thing riskier than dividing up their late fathers empire may have been running it together. Idan and Eyal say they are close, but they dont discuss business. Eyal sees himself as the custodian of a treasure he intends to pass on to his children. Idan, whose eldest son is at Harvard Business School, says hes unsure what roleif anyhis children will play in his businesses. He says only lawyers win when families stay together and eventually start fighting.How many rich brothers can you think of have stayed together and still work together? he asks. My brother and I were very peaceful about it. Hes living happily ever after and so am I. Bloomberg",2017-01-04,m49HOIKJfn3CxCICy62R9I,Israels richest Sammy Ofers estate was divided into two groups of equal value and sons Idan and Eyal each picked one out of a hat as their mother looked on ,competitor,15:55,"One winner, one loser in Ofer brothers lottery worth billions"
-0.29,"June quarter results are not easily comparable on a year-on-year basis due to the change in accounting standards for non-financial companies from 1 April 2016. Even so, on a relative basis, small-sized firms remain laggards vis-à-vis large and medium-sized companies.
				   
				This is interesting especially in light of the ongoing rally in mid- and small-cap stocks. Of course, while there will be a variance in the performance of different companies and sectors, as a category, small firms have done quite poorly. The chart shows net sales and operating profit growth of listed companies in the June quarter. Banks and financial institutions have been left out because their businesses are very different and they have been affected by the clean-up of bad loans started by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Firms in the oil and gas sector have been excluded because of the volatility in their earnings.These non-bank, non-oil firms have been divided into six categories based on the size of their revenues. As the chart shows, the growth in net sales and operating profits for small-sized firms has been dismal in the June quarter. Firms with net sales of below Rs100 crore reported a 12.3% decline in revenues on a cumulative basis, while companies with net sales of over Rs1,000 crore reported a 2.1% growth in revenues. The subdued performance of smaller firms is also reflected in bank credit data. Latest RBI data shows that bank credit to large industrial units grew on a year-on-year basis while that to medium and micro and small industrial units declined.Despite the unimpressive earnings performance, many mid-cap and small-cap stocks are trading at expensive valuations after the sharp run-up that they have seen this year. But that, according to some experts, is largely driven by the underlying bullish sentiment in the market rather than these firms earnings.According to a recent Kotak Institutional Equities report, earnings will become more relevant as the effects of global and domestic macro factors fade. Domestic positive events such as implementation of the seventh pay commission recommendations, a good monsoon and a decline in interest rates have partly played out but are largely priced in, and the markets focus is likely to shift increasingly to earnings and fundamentals as the scope for re-rating of multiples is quite limited, the report said.As such, investors should be increasingly cautious about riding the mid- and small-cap rally blindly.",2016-09-26,m53fkCkiFeDPkBvq5zyYjM,"while there will be a variance in the performance of different companies and sectors, as a category, small firms have done quite poorly.",company,23:34,Small firms remain on a weak footing in June quarter
0.81,"In 2015, Indian Internet and e-commerce companies received funding worth $5.8 billion from private investors, according to research firm Venture Intelligence. In the same period, Amazon.com Inc. reported operating cash flow of $11.9 billion. Free cash flow (FCF), after deducting capital expenditure, stood at $7.3 billion.
				   
				And while funding from private investors has decelerated considerably since the fourth quarter of 2015, it looks like Amazon has upped the tempo with cash flow generation. In 2015, its free cash flow jumped 284%.Should Indian e-tailers just throw in the towel? According to an analyst with a domestic institutional broker, its an uneven playing field. Cash is becoming a scarce resource for home-grown companies, while Amazon appears to be flush with cash.But appearances can be deceiving. Amazons FCF, on a closer look, is nowhere near $7.3 billion. More than half of its capital expenditure is done by purchasing property and equipment using leases. If the purchases had been made outright, FCF would reduce by $5.2 billion. At the least, principal repayments for these leases should be reduced, in which case FCF would reduce by $2.6 billion. Then, the company regularly makes acquisitions, and adjusting for this would reduce FCF by another $800 million. A look at the chart alongside shows how far removed Amazons adjusted FCF is vis-à-vis FCF derived from the traditional calculation. In 2015, free cash amounts to only around $1.3 billion after making these adjustments, less than a fifth of what headline numbers suggest.Also Read: Would you buy a policy or a fund on Flipkart or Paytm?

Some analysts also suggest adjusting for stock-based compensations ($2.1 billion), stating that this should be viewed as normal cash wages, which is how employees see them. But that may be taking things too far. The fact remains that stock-based compensations are a non-cash expense, and thanks to Amazons premium valuations ($336 billion), they result in negligible equity dilution.Even so, Amazon isnt as flush with cash as some perceive. Why else would its long-term debt and other long-term liabilities (leases etc.) rise to $18.2 billion at the end of December 2015, from $15.7 billion a year before that. The value of cash and marketable securities rose from $17.4 billion to $19.8 billion; but adjusted for long-term liabilities, theres not all that much cash left to speak of.Besides, the company continues to invest heavily in established markets, largely on its cloud computing services initiative, Amazon Web Services. So its not like Amazon has firmly rooted itself in developed markets, and now has the luxury of using all its cash to conquer emerging markets such as India. Indeed, a clear sign that it is far from being well established in its main markets is the widening deficit between its shipping revenue and shipping costs. The deficit stood at $5 billion, $4.2 billion and $3.5 billion in the past three years5% of net sales in each of the years. This is hardly a sign of a company raking in the money. Instead, Amazon continues to underprice some of its services even in markets where it is well established. In the process, it is sacrificing profit margins as well as cash flow in order to grow revenues and establish customer loyalty. Yet, having said all this, Amazon India is still miles ahead of counterparts such as Flipkart when it comes to funding. The latter are utterly dependent on private investors to fund their cash burn. If the current ebb in funding continues, they will struggle to survive. Amazon, on the other hand, can raise $6 billionmore than what all Indian e-commerce and Internet companies raised last yearby selling less than 2% of its equity.Also Read: Flipkart gets tougher with its sellers

One hope for Indian e-tailers will be that public investors start acting tough with Amazon, and force it to be less profligate, just as private investors have with them. In end-2014, Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University, wrote in his blog, I would argue that markets have been extraordinarily forgiving of Amazons long loss-making history and have given (Amazon CEO) Mr (Jeff) Bezos breaks that very few companies have received through time. But there are hardly any signs of Bezos facing any significant investor ire. Investors are still buying into his pitch of building revenues now and profits coming in later. Some of them are clearly buying into the cash flow generation story.As pointed out earlier, Indian e-tailers neednt be overawed by Amazons seemingly huge free cash flow.

0.02,"The seven-page minutes of the first meeting of the countrys maiden monetary policy committee (MPC) was replete with obvious statements, and bereft of details and analytics. The minutes gave a reproduction of the resolution of MPC and the vote of each member that was already in the public domain earlier this month.
				   
				The biggest hole in the minutes was the absence of detailed forecasts on growth, inflation and other metrics from each member. It also did not give any inkling of what the members think will happen over the next year or so. In sharp contrast are the detailed numerical forecasts given by the Federal Open Market Committee of the US Federal Reserve.Further, the MPC minutes state that extensive discussions took place on monetary policy (indeed it was a two-day meeting). There is no indication of what these discussions were. Which members felt growth is more important and who did not. Was there a debate and did any member acquiesce or accept a different opinion? Was Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Urjit Patel able to sway opinion? More importantly, what led to the unanimous vote for a rate cut in the end?To be fair, the minutes do have a detailed statement by each of the members and this was the only part that provides a glimpse into the mind of the committee.Reading through the statements provides a clear understanding of which members belong to either the hawk camp or the dove camp. The members who flagged the upside risks to inflation were governor Patel and RBI executive director Michael Patra. Both Ravindra Dholakia, professor at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, and Pami Dua, director at Delhi School of Economics, leaned heavily on the sputtering recovery in growth and the slack in the economy.Sample this from Patras statement. It is crucial, however, to step up vigil around the upturn in inflation projected in the last quarter of 2016-17 to guard against any risk to the target. The one from Patel reads: Therefore, while our model-based projections indicated upside risks to the target, a calibrated policy judgement was warranted, given that some space for policy action had opened up with the fall in inflation in the August reading. Nonetheless, inflation outcomes in Q4 will have to be carefully and continuously monitored as upside risks, albeit lower now than before, persist.This statement by Dholakia shows a clear leaning towards growth: Since there is substantial under-utilisation of capacity in the system, I do not see major risk to inflation if the output gap closes fast. Duas statement also plays the same beat. But in the absence of the data or the forecasts that backed these statements, it is futile to ponder what MPC would do next. Minutes such as these cannot achieve the objective of shaping market expectations.Do the minutes provide a better appreciation of the evolving monetary policy stance or even the issues involved? Do they provide the market with multiple perspectives of the members? The answer to these is a clear No.To be fair, MPC is in its infancy. As it conducts more meetings and evolves, hopefully the minutes too will evolve into a more nuanced and detailed version that answers many questions rather than leave a lot unsaid.

1.0,"The sharp pickup in Infosys Ltds revenue growth shows clearly that it has momentum on its side. Another performance metric that has got tongues wagging is the amount of large deals it has won. 
				   
				The company said last month that the total contract value of the large deals it signed last year stood at $2.79 billion, or 45% higher compared with fiscal year 2014-15. But does this mean the companys revenue growth rate will pick up as a result? Note that HCL Technologies Ltds results in the past few quarters have demonstrated adequately that large order wins do not necessarily result in faster revenue growth. According to the company, new order wins dont translate into commensurate incremental revenues because they also contribute towards making up for earlier projects that were completed.This is a moot point. JPMorgan India Pvt. Ltd said in a note to clients: A significant portion of project-based deals come up for renewal every year; (besides), ~20-25% of annuity-deals come up for renewal/backfilling. Unless technology companies such as Infosys have a high success rate with rebids, the existing base of revenues will get eroded. As such, the new large order wins will first help in plugging the gaps that arose because of completed projects, before contributing to growth.At HCL Technologies, large order wins have amounted to over $1 billion each quarter for over 12 quarters, but revenue growth has been declining. Revenue grew by 8.1% in constant currency terms in the March quarter, about half the rate at which it grew in the April-June 2015 quarter.The JPMorgan note says, The renewal pipe is critical to fill. Winning a very high percentage of renewal deals and more crucially, winning additional business from existing clients requires sound mining/farming skills, which we believe is far more important than hunting for big contracts. Of course, all of this is not to say that Infosys lacks in client mining skills. In fact, its quite likely that the increase in order wins is the result of better mining.Even so, its clearly premature to conclude that the sharp increase in the companys deal wins will be sufficient to plug the gaps that arise from completed projects, as well as contribute handsomely to future growth.",2016-05-24,mN7y9qkZCKNeLjw9jVydFN,"The sharp pickup in Infosyss revenue growth shows clearly that it has momentum on its side

The product has team chat, private messages and voice and videoconferencing.Big companies like Microsoft and IBM are showing renewed interest in the corporate-messaging market as customers flock to internet-based tools like Slack for setting up team communications, said Vanessa Thompson, an analyst at IDC. Microsoft relied on Office 365 and other products to rack up almost $10 billion in commercial cloud revenue for the fiscal year that ended 30 June, and is adding services to draw in more customers.Microsoft is trying to get more airtime with customers that might want something to augment their existing investment in Office 365, Thompson said. What we have started to see is a bunch of companies trying to attack the enterprise versions of WhatsApp and consumer messaging. IDC hasnt published a market size or forecast for the space, which it calls workplace application messaging.A preview of the service, dubbed Microsoft Teams, is available now for Office 365 commercial customers in some versions. It will be generally available in the first quarter and will be included in all Office 365 Enterprise and small business versions.Coordinated tasksMicrosofts product allows teams to add what its calling Tabs, to quickly link to frequently used files and applications. These tabs can relate to Microsoft products like the OneNote note-taking program or to outside productsthe company said its adding support for Zendesk and Asana soon. Teams can also bring in notifications from services like Twitter and GitHub. Like Slack, it also supports the usage of botsprograms that chat with users to automate tasks.Its not Microsofts first foray into this areathe company paid $1.2 billion in 2012 to buy Yammer Inc., but hasnt been able to build up the same kind of usage as Slack and HipChat. Slack raised $200 million at a valuation of $3.8 billion in April. The startup, which introduced its product in 2013, said it reached annualized revenue of $100 million over the summer and surpassed 1.25 million paid users. HipChat was founded in 2010 and acquired by Atlassian two years later. That company declined to break out specific numbers for the product.Microsoft said Teams tight connection with Office and ability to do more than chat give it an advantage over rivals, some of which integrate with parts of Office, but not as closely.Just creating another persistent chat tool isnt all that interesting, said Office vice president Kirk Koenigsbauer. The notion of having this hub for teamwork is a new spin on it. Its not for people who just want to have conversations.Race dayNascar racing company Hendrick Motorsports has been trying out Teams and will use it on the track at the Daytona 500 in February, said Matt Cochran, the companys information technology manager. During a race, Hendrick will use Microsofts product to coordinate pit stops and share feedback among teams supporting its four cars. For example, if one car is seeing a certain kind of wear on tires its crew can alert the other three, which have similar equipment, to make adjustments. Chat is important because the crews need information quickly while audio channels of communications are reserved for conversations between the driver and the crew chief.Hendrick was using Slack, but will switch because Teams works more smoothly with the firms existing Microsoft software and has better security, Cochran said.Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft considered acquiring Slack, but the discussions never got serious enough to involve Nadella or the companys board, and it opted instead to build its own similar software, said two people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the process wasnt public. TechCrunch reported Microsofts potential interest in Slack in March.In a very tongue-in-cheek acknowledgment of the competition, Slack took out a full-page ad in the New York Times Wednesday and posted a copy on its website welcoming Microsoft to the field and noting that all this is harder than it looks.Atlassian president Jay Simons said HipChat has an advantage by focusing purely on communicating, while Microsoft Teams is another feature intended to sell Office 365 subscriptions.The success Atlassian has had in focusing on teams has probably been a wake-up call to Microsoft, he said. On one level, you welcome the competition but on the other level, Microsoft is always a little scary because its a huge company with a lot of customers.Bloomberg Beta, the venture capital arm of Bloomberg LP, is an investor in Slack.

-0.17,"A Rs1.5 trillion mega refinery and petrochemical complex proposed by oil marketing companies (OMCs) will come up in Rajapur city of Ratnagiri district in Maharashtra, said two senior OMC officials aware of the development. 
				   
				The OMCs and the Maharashtra government have been looking for land for the past 10 months, ever since Union oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan announced the project on 28 December 2015. Rajapur is a city in the Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra, around 385km from Mumbai. The OMCsIndian Oil Corp. Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL)plan to jointly build a 60 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) refinery at a cost of Rs1.5 trillion in two phases of 40 and 20 mtpa.The piece of land identified is exactly what we wanted. It is near a potential port and around 14,000 acres. We recently received a confirmation from the Maharashtra government that they have found the required land. Now MIDC (Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation) will go ahead with the acquisition of this land, said the first of the officials cited earlier. Emails sent to the three OMCs on 28 October remained unanswered. The second of the officials added that the land identified is only for the refinery. We still need some piece of land to set up a jetty and a desalination plant for captive water supply. So we are looking for land for that, he said.Mint had reported in September that the OMCs and the state government were finding it difficult to find 15,000 acres of contiguous land in the Konkan region for the complex. Government officials had asked the OMCs to reduce the land requirement. The first official cited earlier said around 20-30% of the land parcel identified is rocky and the OMCs may need to invest Rs10,000-15,000 crore to flatten this portion of land. However, we are happy that the land that has been finalized, he added. The OMCs will form a special purpose vehicle for the project. While Indian Oil will hold a 50% stake, HPCL and BPCL will hold 25% each. The official said they are keen on bringing in a strategic partner in the project and may rework the equity structure post that. Some international partners have shown interest in the project but they will participate only after we have some concrete plans in place (for the refinery) to present to them, said the official. Pradhan had said on 6 June that the refinery had been offered to Saudi Aramco as a prospective partner.The OMCs have finalized the configuration and petrochemical linkages that the refinery will have. The government has appointed Engineers India Ltd as the technical agency to prepare a detailed feasibility report (DFR). The two OMC officials added that with the identification of the piece of land, the DFR can now be commissioned and that the report may take 8-10 months to prepare. Besides, the process for environmental approvals, deliberations on financing options, tax concessions and various board approvals can be put in place now. An analyst with a domestic brokerage said, India has been an exporter of petroleum products and its existing refineries are also being further expanded. Though the countrys own demand for petro products is growing at a fast pace and there is infrastructure development happening, it remains to be seen how far we will be able to absorb additional supply (of products).",2016-11-03,mcGavvC8r4wdBuQE8a4jyO,"Oil marketing firms, Maharashtra government have been looking for land for the project for the past 10 months",both,02:07,Rs1.5 trillion refinery complex to be set up in Rajapur
-1.0,"India is firmly set on a path of economic growth that is estimated to usher in prosperity like never before. This economic prosperity will need to be built on the back of significant transformations across several facilitating elements, the primary ones being infrastructure build-out, energy availability and sustainability. Indias per capita energy consumption currently is almost one-third the global average, and trails far behind the mean figure for the developed world. Our energy consumption is largely based on coal, along with a preponderant dependence on other fossil fuels. Although per capita energy consumption has more than doubled over the past 15 years, almost 240 million people do not have access to affordable energy supply today. 
				   
				Energy consumption in India has grown at a compound annual growth rate of about 6% during the last decade. BP Energy Outlook 2035 expects India to achieve the fastest energy consumption growth among all major economies, despite rapid increases in non-fossil fuel production. The total energy consumption is expected to grow by 128% by 2035. Demand for gas is expected to expand by 155%, followed by coal (121%) and oil (118%), while demand for renewables, nuclear and hydro are estimated to rise by 656%, 334%, and 99%, respectively (see chart). Our potential clearly positions us as the leading global driver of growth in energy consumption in the next 20 years, possibly surpassing China in the process. Even under the most sombre growth scenarios, it is fully expected that Indias growth ambitions will lead to a 100% increase in energy consumption, thereby requiring double the existing energy sources. On the supply side, India is significantly dependent on coal as a primary fuel, which accounts for 58% of the energy consumption in the country. It is estimated that we have one of the largest resource bases of coal, with the policies and gains of the past few years positioning us strongly for the future. It is expected that India will be the largest consumer of coal, equivalent to over 435 million tonnes of oil by 2035. According to current estimates with respect to oil and gas, India is home to only 0.3% of the worlds sedimentary basins. Further, we account for a mere 0.3% of the global oil and 0.8% of the global gas reserves. We are, however, blessed with abundant natural resources in the form of sun and wind. The total wind potential in the country is estimated to be over 30 times the current installed capacity of 27 gigawatts (GW), while our solar potential is expected to grow by about 90 times the current installed capacity of 8GW. Already, the government has an aggressive target of 60GW of wind capacity and 100GW of solar capacity by 2022.ALSO READ | Believing in Indias solar mission takes a leap of faithSuccessive governments have embarked on addressing the forthcoming challenge at varying intensities and levels of aggressiveness. There are, however, some structural issues that affect the sector. Firstly, we have successively underpriced our resources, making the economics of the sector unattractive to a large number of serious investors. The energy subsidies over the years have been a major burden to the economy. The total subsidy for 2014-2015 was Rs76,285 crore. The diesel price deregulation and direct benefit transfer of liquefied petroleum gas subsidy coupled with low oil prices, led to a 64% drop in the subsidy burden for 2015-2016, which now stands at Rs27,571 crore. Gas prices in the country have also been fixed by the government based on different regional benchmarks. Domestic prices were reduced by over 50% from $5.1 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in November 2014 to $2.5 per mmBtu for the period between October and December 2016, making the sector unviable for producers, even though the country is in a supply deficit.Given this scenario, the newly announced pricing regime that promises market prices for natural gas produced from forthcoming fields is a favourable step to attract investment in the sector. While the government has provided support to several segments of our polity at different points in time, the mechanism of delivering such support has been inefficient. Secondly, past events in the policy and governance ecosystem have created the impression of a less-than-desirable regime of instability and lack of administrative efficiency. Thirdly, the relative naivety of infrastructure financing in the early years resulted in increased corporate leverage, without commensurate assets to underpin the debt levels, thus putting pressure on stakeholders, including financial institutions. These three factors, coupled with inefficient underlying processes and systems, have reduced the attractiveness of the sector to investors, whose participation is crucial for us to fulfil our 2035 aspirations.Our current path of growth and evolutionary reforms is likely to widen the gap between the supply and demand of energy, and has potential to cripple any aggressive growth plans. If no significant changes are made to the current trajectory, India might increase the burden on the fiscal front associated with energy independence and sustainability. We will then need to import significantly larger quantities of primary resources to fulfil our growth ambitions. BP expects Indias energy production as a share of consumption to decline from 57% in 2014 to 54% by 2035, and imports to rise by 153%. The countrys oil imports are expected to increase by 161%. This will account for 52% of the increase in imports, followed in volumetric terms by increases in coal imports by over 122%, and gas by over 301%.ALSO READ | A time of change for the oil industryThe future of India and its economic growth plans are critically linked to the fortunes of the energy sector.To propel this key primary sector to the next level, we need a combination of bold and aggressive moves, and a clean up to bring in more efficiency and effectiveness. The moves need to be comprehensive and coordinated. They must be focused on all aspects of managing the demand side, while fomenting the supply side, ensuring that critical enablers are in place, and firing on all cylinders. Given our requirements, the Indian energy landscape will continue to be a combination of fossil and new energy based solutions over the next 20 years. It will be important to get the balance right.The key question is, is it time to get even bolder on renewables? The present government has certainly made huge strides in achieving our renewables aspirations. Can we be the country that sets the course for a new development model for the energy sector? Can we blaze a new trial by learning from the mistakes of the more developed countries with regards to renewables? Is it possible for us to create a new paradigm for sustainable and viable development of the sector as the core to energy independence? All these would imply significant public and private investments in developing cost-effective technologies for the generation, storage and distribution of energy. So the main concern here is, is it better to channel government money earmarked for resource segments toward bets on the future of renewables? Significant innovation, both in terms of technologies and business models, will have to be made to turn the entire value chain into an attractive proposition. The key is to accelerate the process of building scale, experience, talent and knowledge, in order to help us advance the large-scale viability of the sector by many years.Secondly, commodity cycles normally go through high and lows. Currently, we are in one such trough. Is it time to make some aggressive moves that secure our fossil-related resources? The prolonged run of lower oil prices afforded the government an opportunity to create an investment fund to help Indian oil and gas companies bolster domestic as well as overseas investments. While some companies are actively seeking overseas opportunities by leveraging their own financials, we seem to have missed the opportunity for setting up a sovereign oil fund. The basis of this one-time infusion of funds to secure everything from resources to strategic reserves is paramount to our future energy independence. The often-mentioned challenge of how would we administer such a fund? is, at best, rhetorical. Our inability to find answers to such administration challenges has laid many a good idea to an early rest. Thirdly, we must consider complementing our initiatives for supply augmentation with measures that help increase our efficiency in managing demand. These initiatives also need to be supported by policies and regulations like time-of-day pricing, incentives and so on, along with large-scale investment in efficiency boosting technologies across the value chain.Finally, there is a need to rationalize the energy governance software infrastructure. The existing resource-focused governance structure (coal, oil and gas, renewables, etc.) should give way to a more integrated and comprehensive mechanism. Such a mechanism must help us understand the complex trade-offs, and allocate both human and financial resources with energy independence in mind, rather than just the oil versus gas versus coal versus renewables paradigm. The audit and licensing mindset must be replaced with effective measures to drive flexible administrative mechanisms that are more facilitative and supportive.In conclusion, the future of the economic growth of India is dependent on our ability to leverage energy sources to fuel our ambitions for the sector. In his book, The Audacity of Hope, Barack Obama, states, A nation that cant control its energy sources cant control its future. Securing our energy future is thus critical for India to become a superpower in the future.Kaustav Mukherjee is a senior partner and leads the energy practice at BCG India, and Rahool Pai Panandiker is a partner and director at BCG.",2017-01-18,mf6g1hQV6OlV6HIW5mQTiN,"Indias potential clearly positions us as the leading global driver of growth in energy consumption in the next 20 years, possibly surpassing China in the process",both,01:09,Indias economic growth is linked to the fortunes of the energy sector
-0.44,"In May, a government of India Press Information Bureau release stated that the ministry of urban development had directed state governments to convert census towns to urban local bodies to allow for planned development and efficient service provision. Census towns are areas that are governed by village panchayats but are recognized by the census of India as being urban. This mismatch leads to a host of problemsfrom misallocation of resources to unsafe development of densely populated clusters. Much of India has long left her villages, and it is a welcome sign that the government is starting to acknowledge this. But the extent of urbanization in India is still widely underestimated. Urbanization has an important role to play in a countrys economic growth and so it is critical to get it right.
				   
				According to the 2011 census, there are 3,894 census towns spread across states. Maharashtra paid heed to the ministrys notice and recently granted urban local body status to 19 census towns in the Pune region.The ultimate decision to convert census towns to statutory urban local bodies rests with state governments. Municipal laws in some states specify guidelines such as population and density thresholds for notifying areas as urban local bodies, but these guidelines vary widely. For instance, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra have population thresholds of 30,000 and 25,000, respectively, for classifying an area as urban, whereas states such as Kerala and Punjab have no such criteria. Moreover, these guidelines are not binding and state governments can exercise discretion in notifying areas.An IDFC Institute paper by these authors along with Mudit Kapoor found that only 26% of India is governed by urban local bodies as of 2011. The rate varies across states with small hill states such as Mizoram (37%), Nagaland (26%) and Manipur (25%) surprisingly having a higher percentage of its population governed as urban than larger states such as West Bengal (23%), Bihar (11%) and Kerala (16%).Having differing and flexible guidelines makes sense given the heterogeneity across states. But differing guidelines are only meaningful if they are able to capture the true urban and rural characteristics of places across states. In our study cited, we found that this is not the case. At the state level, we found that the extent of areas governed as urban has a weak relationship with income, poverty and population working in non-agricultural activities, all of which are thought to be correlates of urbanization.In an opinion piece in this newspaper (Chasing definitions in India

), we argued that the official modes of recognizing urban areas in India underestimate the true extent of urbanization.Using the census definition, India is 31% urban. But we found that if we apply Ghanas definition of urban, India is 47% urban, and if we apply Mexicos definition, India is 65% urban. The differences in urbanization rates are even starker at a subnational level. For instance, Kerala is an anomaly and goes from being around 16% urban as per the administrative definition to over 99% urban using Ghanas and Mexicos definitions.Following the news of the central governments directive to convert census towns to urban local bodies, a national newspaper reported that the secretary of local self-government in Kerala, A.P.M. Mohammed Hanish, suggested that the minimum population threshold to upgrade areas to an urban status should be increased to 25,000a benchmark that is so high that no country uses it in its urban definition to the best of our knowledge. He stated, If the parameters prescribed by the Union ministry were strictly followed, there may not be any panchayat left in the state. This corresponds exactly to our findings of Kerala already being almost completely urban when we apply other definitions. It also emphasizes the reluctance of state governments to recognize that urbanization is a reality.This desire to stay rural may stem out of perceived advantages that are enjoyed by rural areas, such as access to funding through rural development schemes or lower taxes. However, these advantages may not necessarily exist. In our study, we investigated whether areas that are urban in nature but governed by panchayats make disproportionately more use of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, but found no evidence to support this conjecture. Thus, while staying rural may not confer the benefits some imagine they will receive, the real losers from the state governments actions are the de facto urban areas that are deprived of the benefits of planned development and amenities and services provided to officially urban settlements.India cannot afford to govern its settlements in such an arbitrary manner, and the ministry of urban developments move is one in a series of many steps required to address the lacunae in the current rural-urban categorization system, prevent misallocation of resources, provide efficient services and governance structures, and leverage the ongoing structural transformation to boost economic development.India is more urban than we think. Finally, policymakers are coming round to reckoning with this reality.Comments are welcome at

0.37,"Bengaluru: Another quarter and another downward revision in growth. 
				   
				Infosys Ltd is expected by at least three brokerages to scale down its full-year dollar revenue growth for the third time this year when Indias second-largest software firm declares its third quarter results on Friday.This is not surprising, considering the negative cross currency impact and also partially, on account of managements inability to give a firm guidance. Still, 2015-16 is turning out to be roller-coaster ride for Infosys chief executive officer (CEO) Vishal Sikka. Till a year ago, Sikka seemed to have settled well and appeared to be enjoying his job (from playing cricket with employees in Mysuru to the after-results parties with senior management ranks).By December, Sikka came across as a different boss, unhappy with the progress made by the company, and heard telling his colleagues how he has been unable to implement things he had planned when he took over the current job in August 2014. In April last year, Infosys projected to grow at-best at 13.8%; now it will end the year in March with a less than 8% revenue expansion.Agreed, falling growth at Infosys mirrors the problems faced by the industry at-large: Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. scaled down its full-year growth on three times last year, and will grow at 9%. However, slow business from clients is just one area of concern. A bigger challenge is that, bit by bit, Infosys early turnaround plans put in place in January 2015, seem to be fizzling out. Retaining senior management is another headache for Sikka. Although overall attrition continues to be stable, five executive vice presidents (EVPs) left Infosys last year, compared to three EVP departures in the first 17 months of Sikkas tenure (1 August 201431 December 2015).Also read: Five things to watch for in TCS Q3 results tomorrowSikkas record to make the company future-ready, by having $2 billion from newer technologies and platforms, and another $1.5 billion from mergers and acquisitions and finally by improving its revenue per employee to $80,000 by March 2021, is patchy at best. This is not to pooh-pooh Sikkas efforts; he has tried his best till now. But Sikkas best seems to have not made a dent in an insular organisation like Infosys. How can Infosys embrace the new technologies if it shies away from acquisitions (Infosys has not made a single acquisition in the last 15 months)? During this time, Wipro Ltd spent over a $1 billion in buying companies. Most worrying is that despite Sikkaa repeated missives to employee to shape-up and embrace automation platforms in projects and learn newer skill sets, Infosyss revenue per employee refuses to improve. Finally, assuaging investor concerns, many of whom are now getting jumpy over some of the founders reported unhappiness with the CEO, is a big challenge. Despite Infosys estimated to grow faster than Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) in the current year, Infosys shares were down 8.4% as against a 7.7% decline in IT index last year. Infosys shareholders increased their wealth by 32.3% (as against a 14.21% return made in IT Index) in the period between 1 August 2014 and 31 December 2015.With this as the backdrop, Mint brings to you five things to watch out for when Infosys declares its earnings on Friday:Revenue forecast: Brokerage BNP Paribas sees Infosys recording a 1.5% sequential decline in dollar revenue (declining 0.5% in constant currency terms) at $2.55 billion for the October-December period. Management is further expected to narrow its full-year dollar revenue growth to less than 8%. This could set alarm bells ringing for investors as this suggests that Sikkas new measures to turnaround the company are taking longer than earlier expected.Senior management exits and steps management is taking to arrest attrition: A bigger headache for Sikka in this financial year is turning out to be the departure among senior management ranks. Exits of senior employees is leading to poor execution, a reason Sikka has conceded in the past behind companys underperformance.Where is the new in old Infosys? To Sikkas credit, Infosys over the last few years has hired people in the areas of artificial intelligence and pushed to embrace automation platforms. But the proof of the pudding is if indeed Infosys has been able to deploy some of these technologies to either improve its profitability or win business from newer companies which are acting as agents of disruption. Has Infosys won any business from companies like Uber or Airbnb or Facebook? It is over two years since Infosys first detailed its ambition of becoming a $20 billion firm by March 2021, and yet the management shies away from disclosing the progress made from monetising platforms.What is the challenge in translating business from large deal wins? Infosys under Sikka has significantly improved its large deal wins in a quarter ($809 million in April-June period and over $1 billion in the July-September period). For some unexplainable reason, this improved deal win is not translating into growth. Management clarity on this theme will be important.Infosys Consulting, BPO and Edgeverve continue to remain weak: Since August 2014, EdgeVerve and Infosys BPO units continue to underperform. Together, both accounted for a little over 13% of its $9.5 billion revenue last year. Infosys consulting was the third weak area at the beginning of this financial year. All three units now have new leaders, and any significant growth for Infosys can come only if there is growth in at-least one of these units.",2017-01-11,mrkAslcCJ8FdoxbvnSQ9GP,"Time is running out, and amid falling growth, its time Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka starts delivering on his new strategy as investors patience runs thin",company,09:47,Infosys Q3 results today: Five things to watch out for
0.31,"Bengaluru: Customer support software maker Freshdesk Inc. on Tuesday said it raised $55 million in funding, in a round led by new investor Sequoia Capital, with participation from existing investor Accel Partners.
				   
				Freshdesk, which is based in San Bruno, California and has a large presence in Chennai, raised $50 million from Tiger Global Management in April 2015. This latest round of funding brings the total amount raised by the company to $150 million, making it one of the most well capitalized product start-ups in India. The firms earlier investors include Google Capital.The six-year-old start-up makes software that helps small and medium businesses handle their customers. It sells this software to companies over the Internet for a monthly fee, in a model known as software as a service (SaaS). Although enterprise SaaS dominates now, small and medium business SaaS will overtake it by 2020, according to a March 2016 report by Google and Accel India, which predicts that the $24 billion revenue from the small and medium business SaaS market in 2015 will increase to $76 billion by then.Freshdesk said it will use the additional funds to focus on the new products it launched earlier this year.After starting out with one product, also called Freshdesk, a cloud-based customer support platform, in 2014 it launched Freshservice, which helps companies meet their internal IT support requests.In February, it launched Hotline.io, which allows businesses to provide support to their customers from within apps, and its most recent product launch is called Freshsales, a CRM software to help sales teams.While typical SaaS companies build one product, and invest heavily in sales to conquer the market for that one product, Freshdesk believes there is great scope in building an ecosystem of products that complement each other.Also Read: Freshdesk buys chat-bot firm ChatimityAnalysts say this is prudent for a company catering to small businesses.Although a multi-vendor approach is the most popular when it comes to CRM, for the SMB (small and medium business) market, it is easier if they pick everything from one company. The smaller the company is, the easier this will be, said Olive Huang, research director at advisory firm Gartner.Huang also said that Freshdesk needs to create differentiation to stand out. What if their bigger counterparts reduce price in their segment? They wouldnt have any space. Eventually they cannot sell only because they are cheaper; they have to have a differentiator. That hasnt come up yet, she said.Freshdesk serves more than 80,000 customers, although it doesnt disclose how many of these are premium paying customers and how many use the free service it offers.

-0.25,"The anonymity of bitcoin gained its myriad adherents among anarchists and drug dealers around the world. Now, though, its looking like the digital currency isnt quite anonymous enough.
				   
				Consider the sudden popularity of Zcash and Monero, two new cryptocurrencies that offer confidential transactions. When Zcash first became available last week, demand was so strong that its founders temporarily became paper billionaires. Monero rose to fame after a popular marketplace in the dark webthe portion of the Internet where people sell everything from guns to hacking toolsadded it as a payment option. The newcomers sense opportunity in one of bitcoins flaws: Analytics companiesfueled by government research grantshave gotten really good at exposing users identities, which were supposed to be hidden by public keys that reduced them to a mere string of numbers and letters. This is possible because all transactions are recorded in a permanent public ledger, allowing anyone to see the entire history of each bitcoin and all the activity of each account. A single payment to an online retailer can be enough to reveal a users identity, which in turn reveals everything that person has done with that account.In other words, the same transparency that guarantees the validity of bitcoin transactions also allows people to find out whether a users bitcoin previously passed through dirty hands. Such information is both an asset and a liability. Its useful for helping service providers make informed decisions about whether they want someone as a customer, but it can come with the responsibility of having to screen those customers to stay on the right side of the law. The US government, for example, has outsourced some of its crime-fighting job by requiring financial institutionsincluding digital currency exchangesto enforce anti-money-laundering regulations. Drug-dealing and tax evasion can be tough to stop at the source, but the perpetrators typically have to move money, so banks and exchanges are in a good position to identify and report illicit activity.On the surface, privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies seem designed precisely to undermine such controls. Monero mixes multiple transactions together so that a source cannot be directly linked to a destination. Zcash creates shielded transactions where everything is hidden except for a string of data that proves the transaction is valid. Bitcoin also plans to add some of these features in the near future.As bad as it looks, though, developers arent creating anonymous payment systems because they want to help criminals evade the law. Theyre doing it because thats the only way a decentralised currency can work. If, say, users have to evaluate the acceptability of each bitcoin based on its transaction history, then one coin can be worth more than another and the currency loses its reason for existence.The dollar is successful because its pretty much always worth a dollar, backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. Thats true whether its freshly printed or old and torn, whether it has a pristine history or has passed through the hands of Al Capone. A publicly controlled digital currency doesnt have that legal tender status and probably never will, so it must find some other way to achieve the same fungibility.Anonymity achieves this by preventing merchants or service providers from seeing any blemishes that might prevent them from honouring a unit of currency. Reducing the opportunity for external judgment is pretty much the goal of privacy protection in general. Ideally, so little information is revealed that everyoneand every valid transactionis treated equally.Decentralised currencies arose because people wanted to transact in a digital world without having to ask permission. The extent to which this facilitates criminal activity depends entirely on the prevalence of criminal activity in the real world. Maybe thats a problem that needs to be addressed outside the monetary system.

				The plant in Odishas Angul district has so far received competing offers from Singapores SembCorp, Adani Power and JSW Energy, one of the three people cited above said, requesting anonymity.The sell side mandate was given to EY around three months ago following which SembCorp has made an upfront cash offer of close to Rs1,600 crore for the equity component of the project, said the person cited above.JSW and Adani have offered a higher price of more than Rs2,000 crore, but the offer involves an upfront cash payment of around Rs500 crore to Rs600 crore towards equity and the remaining upon fulfilment of certain conditions linked to singing of power purchase agreements and coal linkages, the person said.JSW is keen to replicate the same structure it followed while buying JSPLs (Naveen Jindal-led Jindal Steel and Power Ltds) 1,000MW thermal unit this year, where it paid Rs500 crore cash advance while tying up the rest of the payment to pre-defined conditions regarding fuel security and power offtake, the person added. Emails sent to Adani group, SembCorp and EY did not elicit any response at the time of going to press.A JSW Energy spokesperson denied that the company is in talks to buy the asset.Your query is completely speculative and baseless. The company reiterates that there is no truth and categorically deny any discussion by JSW Energy with them, the spokesperson said.JITPL is controlled by listed firms Jindal Poly Investments Ltd (JPIL) and Jindal Photo Ltd (JPL) through Jindal India Powertech Ltd, a holding company owned by JPIL and JPL.The promoters have been in talks to sell the unit in the past too, but a deal did not materialize due to valuation mismatches. However, things are likely to be different this time because JITPL needs some immediate cash infusion to pay lenders and is already behind its repayment schedule, the second person said, also declining to be named.Also, a section of minority shareholders want the promoters to divest from power and focus on the core poly films business, the person added.An email sent to JITPL and BC Jindal group did not receive a response.The Angul project was completed at a cost of Rs7,537 crore with overall debt of Rs5,900 crore and an equity of Rs1,637 crore.Industry analysts said that if the SembCorp offer is accepted, JIPL and JPL could get Rs600 crore and Rs160 crore, respectively, of the proceeds and another Rs685 crore to Jindal Poly Films Ltd, the listed operating entity of the group.JITPL currently has long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) for 256MW capacity (156MW with Odisha Gridco and 100MW with Kerala State Electricity Board Ltd) and has also executed a 12-year PPA with Tata Power Trading Corp. Ltd (TPTCL) for a capacity of up to 900MW at a guaranteed base tariff of Rs2.70 per unit.Concerns over fuel supplies, high interest cost and absence of long-term PPAs among thermal power producers in India has led to distress among several power companies and has led to many assets changing hands.In July, Sajjan Jindal-promoted JSW signed a definitive agreement to acquire Jaiprakash Power Ventures 500MW thermal plant at Bina in Madhya Pradesh at base enterprise value of Rs2,700 crore.

0.78,"Global private equity firm KKR-backed Avendus Capital will be managing $2 billion by the end of the current financial year, a top executive of the firm said.
				   
				We should reach assets under management (AUM) of almost $2 billion (approximately Rs13,300 crore) in the next three to four months. Currently, we are at Rs10,000 crore. We have grown substantially in the past couple of years. Around two-three years ago, we were at Rs4,000 crore, said George Mitra, chief executive officer of Avendus Wealth Management.The rapidly growing wealth management practice was started by Avendus Capital in 2009 out of a need to build a business with recurring revenue stream as compared with the firms advisory business.Avendus Capital has been at the front-lines of Indias start-up funding boom, engineering several transactions and emerging as the top new economy-oriented investment bank. But the business of an investment bank is a transaction-oriented one.Till 2008-09, the only business Avendus was in was financial advisory. We realized if you have to grow to become a major financial institution from a boutique investment bank, you need recurring revenues, said Mitra.Towards this end, Avendus entered the asset management and wealth management businesses, although it smartly leveraged its strength. We were creating value for a lot of entrepreneurs on the advisory side. The thought process behind the wealth business was that it provided us another touch point with those same entrepreneurs. Wealth could provide a bridge between transactions; so, as a platform, we could maintain a continuity of relationship with the entrepreneur, said Mitra.Later, Avendus also added more clients in the form of general partners (GPs) of private equity funds that the firm dealt with regularly on the advisory side. The Avendus wealth management practice continues to focus on this inner circle of relationships built through the advisory practice. We are very focused. We dont service anyone outside the sphere of entrepreneurs, family offices and GPs of funds. We dont have too many clients. Today, we have a little more than 300 clients, said Mitra.That focus has worked.While we appeal to people who have more than Rs25 crore (to invest), we have had clients whom we have taken on board with Rs50 lakh to Rs1 crore and who have, over time, grown to become Rs200 crore and more. Thats how we have grown as a firm, by continuing (to be) with entrepreneurs on their life journey, said Mitra.The growth has also been helped by the exit of several foreign banks from the wealth management business over the past four-five years. Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, UBS and EFG Group have exited the wealth management business. Taking advantage of this disruption, we expanded our team big time. At the end of last calendar year, we were a 20-member team. Today, we are almost 50-strong. We have doubled our sales force; but on the product and operations side, the growth has been far more, said Mitra.The KKR brand too has helped. There is a lot of brand recognition for KKR and the rub-off effect of a large institution which has strong processes. It gives people the comfort that there wont be mis-selling, said Mitra.According to Kotak Wealth Managements Top Of The Pyramid 2016 report, the number of ultra high net-worth individuals in India is estimated to have grown to 146,600 in fiscal 2016, from around 137,100 the previous year.In 2015-16, these individuals had a combined net worth of Rs135 trillion, the report added.",2016-11-02,myJJCficvpQScVcVKWJmyH,Avendus Capitals growth in the wealth management business has been aided by the exit of foreign banks such as Morgan Stanley and BofA-ML from the sector,company,23:55,Avendus aims to manage $2 billion assets by fiscal end

0.57,"Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd beat analysts quarterly earnings estimates but expects to grow at best at 9.2% in the year ending 31 Marcha first in the history of Indias offshoring industry when the nations top three software companies expect annual growth to be in single digits.
				   
				Infosys cut its full-year dollar revenue forecast for the second time this fiscal, and now expects to grow between 8.2 and 9.2%, and 8-9% in constant currency terms.The sharp cut in FY17 USD revenue growth guidance, despite the recovery in growth momentum in 2QFY17, reflects a shift to a conservative approach on guidance after two successive cuts on the aggressive stance adopted at FY17-start, Pankaj Kapoor, director of India IT services and software equity research at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, wrote in a note. Chief executive officer Vishal Sikka said Infosys was scaling back its growth target because it had performed poorly in the first quarter and on account of near-term uncertainties.Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., which has most of its employees in India, has also cut its revenue growth forecast twice and expects to grow at 8.5-9.5% in 2016. Cognizant follows the calendar year. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Indias largest software services firm, does not give forecasts, but after it reported a poor 0.3% sequential dollar revenue growth on Thursday, it will be a tall task for the company to better the growth rate of 7.1% reported last fiscal year.Worryingly for both Infosys and TCS, it is not just sluggish revenue growth which is of concern. Both firms sounded less confident of maintaining profitability, with Infosys conceding that operating margin may be below its stated range of 25-26%.Infosyss sharp downward revision from the first growth outlook of between 11.8% and 13.8% dollar revenue expansion in April means that Infosys has shaved off $440 million in business from its first projection of adding $1.31 billion in incremental revenue this year. For Infosys, an at-best 9.2% growth means it expects to do $870 million in new business this year compared to $790 million last year.Infosys Ltd shares ended the day 2.53% lower at Rs1,025.70 on NSE even as the Nifty index rose 0.12% to 8,583.40 points.ALSO READ | Is Infosys being overly conservative with its guidance?Infosys said on Friday that revenue for the three months ended 30 September improved 3.5% to $2.58 billion from $2.5 billion in the preceding quarter. This was on account of the company partially recording $20 million in business from the Goods Services and Tax Network project, and a 4.5% growth in business from clients in banking and financial services segment.In constant currency terms, revenue grew 3.9% sequentially. Net profit rose 5.5% to $539 million from $511 million in the April-June period as the company deployed fewer people at expensive overseas client sites. A Bloomberg survey of analysts expected Infosys to report revenue of $2.58 billion and profit of $529.81 million in the September quarter.Operating margin expanded 80 basis points to 24.9% at the end of the September quarter, compared with 24.1% at the end of June. There are a couple of heartening takeaways in Infosyss performance during the second quarter, say analysts. First, a 4.6% sequential increase in business from banking clients suggests that Infosys may be winning customers at the expense of other large technology vendors.Second, Infosys reported over $1.2 billion in large deal wins during this quarter. This means that in little less than 18 months, Infosys has managed to increase its large deal wins from a little over $400 million a quarter to $1.2 billion.Analysts at Citibank said in a note after Infosys declared its earnings that fairly all-round growth in key geographies and verticalsbetter than what peer TCS reported is another positive for the company. The US business, which brings 61.5% of Infosyss revenue, improved 2.6% sequentially, while business from India, which accounts for 3.4% of overall revenue, jumped 29.1%.The company added 78 new clients in the second quarter, taking the total number of customers to 1,136.

-1.0,"Kotak Mahindra Banks December quarter results reflect a lot of luck and some grit as well. At a time when the currency withdrawal had hit credit growth for most banks, the private sector lenders loan disbursals grew 12%, driven by its corporate loan book rather than retail book, which was the case for most banks. The lenders corporate loan book expanded by 23.6% while its retail disbursals consisting of loans to homebuyers, small businesses, personal loans and loan against property grew by 12%.
				   
				But there is more. According to Dipak Gupta, joint managing director of Kotak Mahindra Bank, the third quarter numbers reflect more of the integration of the lender with ING Vysya Bank rather than demonetization on the asset side. This simply means that the merger paid off and as processes and operations of both banks meshed, the output generated was more in terms of higher loan growth.The effect on deposits is, of course, as expected. The lenders current and savings account ratio surged to 42% as of 31 December, driven by a 45% jump in savings account balances. This gave muscle to its margins, making them expand to 4.49%.However, Kotak Mahindra Bank didnt escape the effects of the currency withdrawal. Its loan disbursals to small and medium enterprises stagnated and Gupta said that the bank had noticed a slowdown in the momentum of disbursals from November onwards due to the currency withdrawal. Perhaps investors should watch out for lingering effects of demonetization in the coming quarters.Asset quality was a mixed affair with bad loan ratios deteriorating from a year ago despite the strong loan growth. Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) were 2.42% of the total loan book, higher than 2.3% a year ago while net NPA ratio stood at 1.07%, which was higher than the 0.96% in the year-ago period.It is no surprise that the stock surged 7% to Rs794.65 on Wednesday as the private sector lender delivered a net profit growth of 39% for the quarter ended December, beating the estimate of the most bullish analysts. At this price, the shares trade at a steep multiple of 5.28 times expected book value for the current fiscal year.But investors should perhaps wait another quarter to assess whether the managements guidance of a strong FY17 second half comes true.",2017-01-26,nMOoIUKb2HznVuCxAynZRK,"At a time when demonetisation had hit credit growth for most banks, Kotak Mahindra Banks loan disbursals grew 12%, driven by its corporate loan book",competitor,07:23,Kotak Mahindra Bank: A lot of luck and a bit of grit

Gas distributors such as Indraprastha Gas Ltd and Mahanagar Gas Ltd are expected to benefit on account of this move. Their profit margins could improve depending on the extent of the decline in prices the companies pass on to consumers. In general, decline in LNG custom duty is expected to encourage the use of natural gas, which is considered a relatively cleaner fuel.As regards the creation of an integrated oil major, while the idea is certainly laudable, the key challenge will be integration issues especially on the human resources side, pointed out K.

Drillers added 29 rigs in the week to 20 January, bringing the total count up to 551, the most since November 2015, energy services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday.US oil production has risen more than 6% since mid-2016, although it remains 7% below a historic high in 2015.

It was trading at $55.48 per barrel down 1 cent from its previous close.Both Brent and WTI had traded higher earlier in the session on the back of output cuts by Opec and other producers.

-0.25,"On 13 October, the fertilizer ministry issued an office memo stating that the movement of finished fertilizers by coastal shipping/inland waterways will be eligible for a freight subsidy granted by the government to fertilizer firms.
				   
				 So far, only railway freight for primary movement of finished fertilizers from plants/ports to the nearest railway station of the dealers was reimbursed. The fertilizer ministry has a yearly budget of about Rs2,000 crore for this subsidy.Primary movement has been redefined and expanded to cover transportation by rail, and/or coastal shipping or inland water transport or by any or two or by all three modes of transportation from the plant or port to the various railway rake points of districts (where dealers are located), P.B. Sahu, a fertilizer ministry official, wrote in the memo. Fertilizer firms in the public, private and co-operative sectors pay the railway freight for the primary movement and then claim the money from the government, according to the practice followed.In the new regime, freight subsidy for primary movement using coastal shipping/inland water transport will be reimbursed by the government in the same manner but at the lower of the equivalent railway rates or actual rates paid by the fertilizer firms, Sahu said.The development lends a big boost to coastal shipping and inland water transport, which the government is seeking to promote to ease congestion on rail and road, reduce carbon emissions and cut logistics costs.Fertilizer is seen as an ideal cargo to shift to water. Fertilizer production is very energy-intensivewith the cost of feedstock and fuel alone accounting for 55-80% of production cost. From the logistics perspective, therefore, production cost is of particular interest. Growing agri-produce and an increase in the overall sown area will prompt greater demand for fertilizer end-productsaround 70 million tonnes (mt) by 2020 and around 120 mt by 2035. The volume of imports of fertilizer raw materials and finished products will grow at 4%, keeping the volumes handled at Indian ports fairly stable by 2020.Indias 12 ports owned by the central government loaded 8.493 mt of finished fertilizers in the year to March 2016, clocking growth of 8.18%. While rail is currently the primary mode of transport for long-distance fertilizer movement, experts say a modal-mix shift towards coastal shipping can significantly cut costs. For instance, the movement between Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra costs Rs1,928 per tonne via rail, while the same movement via road and rail-supported coastal shipping could cut cost to as low as Rs1,415 per tonnea potential cost saving of 25-30%, according to the ministry. If key rail movements are considered from major fertilizer plants to the top-200 fertilizer-consuming districts in India, around 10 plants have the potential to shift to coastal shipping, the ministry reckons.Fertilizer corporations with multiple plant locations across the country seem to have the highest potential to leverage coastal shipping.Finished products constitute half of the 28 mt of fertilizers that India imports in a year, with raw materials for the farm nutrients making up the other half. The inclusion of coastal shipping/inland water transport in the freight subsidy scheme for moving fertilizers could spur interest among fleet owners by purchasing the right vessels that can move seamlessly between sea and inland waterways to tap this business. Indias maritime regulator, the director general of shipping, has already set rules for running the so-called river-sea vessels.After putting in place an enabling environment to kick-start the fledgling sector through the Sagarmala programme, the government is now targeting fertilizers and automobiles to show the way. The shipping of cars by sea on roll-on-roll-off ships is slowly picking up on the back of an 80% discount in vessel-related and cargo-related charges over the rates approved at the ports owned by the Indian government for a two-year period.The shipment of cars on national waterway 1 between Varansai and Haldia has also commenced.Water currently contributes less than 6% to Indias modal mix and the government is looking to double this share by 2025. China uses its inland waterways to transport raw material and finished goods between the eastern and western provinces; water contributes 24% to Chinas freight modal mix. Australia carries 17% of goods through coastal shipping. In Germany, 11% of goods are moved through inland waterways and coastal shipping.If the movement of automobiles and fertilizers through coastal shipping and inland waterways catches up, it would not be long before producers of other commodities such as oil, liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas, steel, iron ore, coal and cement also seriously consider a big switch to this cost-effective and eco-friendly mode of transport, with a little more support from the government. This would give a lot more confidence to cargo owners, who are now sceptical about the sustainability of such a shift, to move their goods by water.The fertilizer ministrys decision to bring coastal shipping and inland water transport under the freight subsidy plan shows that the Narendra Modi government is willing to tweak existing schemes to prop up the twin sectors, rather than formulate new incentive packages to achieve the objective. Many more funding schemes with individual ministries/departments can be tapped to promote water transport.P. Manoj looks at trends in the shipping industry.",2016-10-28,o4WIJOP90gHDELZ7KCWZGM,Fertilizer ministrys decision to bring coastal shipping and inland water transport under freight subsidy plan shows government is willing to tweak schemes to prop up the twin sectors,both,00:10,"Will fertilizers, automobiles show water transport the way?"
0.2,"Seoul: The long-orchestrated plan to cement Jay Y. Lees position atop Samsung Group may put him in jail instead, raising questions about who would step in to run South Koreas biggest conglomerate in the aftermath.
				   
				Prosecutors are seeking Lees arrest on allegations including bribery and embezzlement, which if proven could prompt him to relinquish duties at the family business. Potential replacements include executives running key divisions of the dominant electronics business, as well as a sisterhotel executive Lee Boo-jin. While a long shot, her anointment would mark a seismic shift in the way the nations patriarchal empires are run.After spending years following his fathers footsteps to the chairmans seat of Samsung Group, Lee is trying now to avoid the missteps that triggered his fathers two criminal convictions. Even if the accusations against him involving South Koreas president are proven in court, its still possible Lee could return to the company later or even call the shots from behind bars, just as executives from Hyundai Motor Co. and SK Group have done.Chaebol executives have a history of managing from the jail, whether it be via lawyers or secretaries visiting them, said Lee Kyung-mook, a professor at Seoul National Universitys Graduate School of Business.Samsung declined to comment when asked about a potential leadership vacuum. A court hearing is scheduled for Wednesday to determine whether to approve the prosecutors request for an arrest warrant. Whether the warrant is granted or not, prosecutors would continue their probe with a possible indictment coming later.Lees potential arrest in the scandal surrounding President Park Geun-hye is another calamity for the vice chairman of Samsung Electronics Co., the largest maker of mobile devices. Last year, the company pulled its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone off the shelves because some devices burst into flames. The debacle cost Suwon-based Samsung an estimated $6 billion and a competitive advantage before Apple Inc. released its iPhone 7 models.Lee, 48, has had trouble matching the success of his father, Lee Kun-hee, who transformed Samsung Electronics from a copycat appliance maker into a global powerhouse in TVs, smartphones and memory chips. The elder LeeSouth Koreas richest mansuffered a crippling heart attack in May 2014, and Samsung shares fell that year and the next before recovering in 2016.Its a perilous practice that a person can take over a company just because he or she was born to a successful father, opposition lawmaker Park Yong-jin said. The biggest problem with our economy is that people with unproven skills run its biggest companies.Lee doesnt play the role of day-to-day manager, depending rather on co-CEOs and other top managers to handle those responsibilities. But employees and shareholders depend on him to provide strategic guidance when it comes to decisions like the next big bets in technology or potential acquisitions.After the elder Lees collapse, executives including J.K. Shin, who is in charge of the smartphone division, handled daily operations for Samsung Electronics.The son became de facto leader of the group, which then embarked on an intricate reorganization to solidify his control. Prosecutors want to know if that effort involved making payments to a presidential confidante in exchange for government support.If Lee is imprisoned, he could be replaced by Samsung Electronics co-chief executive officer Kwon Oh-hyun, a 64-year-old who leads the semiconductor and display businesses. The successes of those two divisions helped propel Samsung to its best operating profit in three years during the quarter ended 31 December.Another candidate is Yoon Boo-keun, who heads the consumer-electronics unit encompassing TVs and appliances.Hes part of the trio with Lee and Kwon that has run Samsung Electronics, said Park Ju-gun, president of Seoul-based corporate watchdog CEOSCORE. Samsung could be run as if that trio were still intact.It also would be natural for Lee Kun-hees eldest daughter to be considered, said Chung Sun-sup, who runs corporate researcher Chaebul.com.Lee Boo-jin, 46, is CEO of the luxury Hotel Shilla Co. chain, which is on track to post revenue growth for a sixth straight year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. She owns 5.5% of Samsung C&T Corp., one of the biggest shareholders in Samsung Electronics.Some speculate she could practically take over, but being a large shareholder doesnt mean she could run a massive company like Samsung Electronics, Chung said. Realistically speaking, Kwon may be the one.Lee Kyung-mook, the Seoul National University professor, also identified her as a candidate to manage the conglomerate, albeit temporarily.A daughter taking over Samsung would break with tradition in South Korea, where sons succeed fathers at the chaebol that dominate the economy. Still, Samsung has been a trailblazer in doing away with old business practices and hiring women aggressively.Lees sister may briefly take the reins, but theres little chance shed take over permanently given she has fewer shares in the firm than her brother, the professor said.The youngest surviving daughter, Lee Seo-hyun, is an executive at Samsung C&T.In the meantime, Jay Y. Lee may miss the window of opportunity to succeed his father as parliament moves to make it harder for Samsung to use its own shares to help him consolidate control, said Heo Pil-seok, CEO at Midas International Asset Management in Seoul. That could make the stock more volatile.Park, the lawmaker, submitted a bill nicknamed the Jay Y. Lee Law to prevent financial firms from supporting the types of internal mergers orchestrated to help Lee boost control.The corporate governance at Samsung could remain awkward for an extended period of time, and that would increase uncertainties, Heo said.The elder Lee faced his own scandalsa 1996 conviction for bribing a former president and a 2008 conviction for embezzlement and tax evasion. Both times, he was pardoned.That history may work against his children, and Jay Y. Lee acknowledged publicly that someone else may take over the collection of about 60 divisions whose combined revenues equal about one-fifth of South Koreas gross domestic product. During a parliamentary hearing before President Parks impeachment, he was asked whether he would surrender management control of Samsung.

				Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and mutual funds have been more optimistic, with the latter increasing their ownership in 12 Tata group firms and cutting their stake in seven. In the December quarter, state-run LIC, Indias biggest investor, cut its stakes in seven out of the 11 Tata group firms it owns stakes in, according to stock exchange data. Twenty-seven Tata group firms are listed. FPIs slashed holdings in nine and increased their holdings in nine Tata group firms. LIC cut its stake by the most in Tata Chemicals Ltd, where it reduced its holding by 73 basis points (bps) to 2.59%. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. In Tata Global Beverages Ltd, it slashed its holdings by 60 bps and by 35 bps in Tata Communications Ltd. Titan Co. Ltd and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd are the only Tata group firms in which LIC increased its stakes during this period.Overall, the value of LICs holdings in listed Tata firms came down by Rs2,371 crore or 6.4% between 24 October, when the Tata Sons board suddenly ousted Mistry, and the end of December. In comparison, the entire market capitalization of Tata listed firm fell by 7.6%.  A lot of things that were kept under wraps have come to the fore after the Tata-Mistry dispute started. So, from an FPI point of view, especially when US markets have started looking up, there is not much reason for them to stay heavily invested in Tata firms for the time being, said the head of a mid-sized asset management firm, requesting anonymity. FPIs too slashed their holdings in Tata group firms such as Tata Elxsi Ltd (3.2 percentage points) and 1.9 percentage point in Tata Motors. On the flip side, foreign investors also raised their stakes in 9 firms, including Trent Ltd by 2.66 percentage points and Indian Hotels Co. Ltd (54 bps). However, given the overall decline in prices of Tata group firmsa trend mirroring the broader marketthe value of FPI holdings in Tata firms fell by 10.9%, or Rs18,131 crore, between 24 October putsch and the end of December. In the three months to December, FPIs sold $6.72 billion worth of shares.LIC is looking to slash its holdings in Tata group firms further gradually over concerns that the ongoing Tata-Mistry feud may continue for several years, diminishing returns on investments, according to two people familiar with LICs investment strategies, including an LIC official. They did not want to be named because the matter is market-sensitive. The Tata-Mistry spat has reached the doors of the National Company Law Tribunal and hearings are on from Tuesday. An email sent to LIC remained unanswered. No one knows how long this will continue and how much damage it will inflict on investments (made) by shareholders.

				Rosneft PJSC is part of a group of investors that beat suitors from Saudi Arabia and Iran to buy Essar Oil Ltds Vadinar refinery, Indias second-biggest, in a deal announced over the weekend. Russias largest oil producer is following a strategy by resource-rich firms and nations to secure outlets for their output, and may supply the facility with Venezuela crude and challenge Middle East exporters that provide about two-thirds of the countrys imports.India will be the most important product-growth market over the next 25 years, making it important to Russia, according to Neil Beveridge, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.With the Essar deal, Rosneft is targeting a market of 1.3 billion people that imports more than 80% of its crude requirements and which is forecast by the International Energy Agency to be the worlds fastest-growing oil consuming nation through 2040. The country has emerged as a bright spot for global demand as the quickest economic expansion among major economies spurs increased use of trucks, cars and motorbikes.Market accessThe transaction also includes about 2,700 Essar Oil retail stations, a market that has attracted top oil companies such Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc. Most of Essars output is sold domestically, either through its own outlets or to government-owned fuel retailers.The access to the Indian market attracted Rosneft the most, Prashant Ruia, chairman of Essar Oil, said in an interview in Mumbai on Sunday. It is one of the worlds largest markets.

Saudi Arabia is buying stakes in refiners through its state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco in countries from Indonesia to the US. Kuwait is also investing in processing facilities.Essar Oils Vadinar refinery in Gujarat can process about 400,000 barrels a day. It was designed to run on low-quality crudes from Venezuelan or the Middle East, rather than Russian grades. Venezuela made up almost half the refinerys supplies in the first six months of the year, followed by Iran, according to shipping data obtained by Bloomberg.The best way for Rosneft to supply crude to Essar is via its equity in Venezuela, said Tushar Tarun Bansal, director at Ivy Global Energy, an industry consultant in Singapore. Bringing this crude to India helps Rosneft and Russia the most by securing their equity crude supply and not adversely impacting its own market in Europe.By comparison, Middle East exporters led by Iraq and Saudi Arabia provided more than 65% of Indias overall crude imports during the April-June quarter, according to oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan.Strategic dealsRosneft and Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the state oil company, agreed earlier this year to terms on swapping crude oil and fuels. The Russian oil giant also has interests in five projects in VenezuelaPetromonagas, Petrovictoria, Petromiranda, Boqueron and Petroperijathat contain estimated oil reserves that exceed 20.5 billion tonnes (about 150 billion barrels), the company said in February.India has been deepening its energy ties with Russia, which has also developed nuclear reactors in the South Asian nation and has discussed increasing supplies of natural gas through both LNG and pipelines. Indian state-owned companies have so far spent almost $6 billion for new stakes in Russian oil assets in Siberia.After letting India companies invest in Russian exploration and production projects, India is reciprocating by allowing Russian oil major Rosneft to invest in refining in India, said Bernsteins Beveridge. These agreements are very strategic, aimed at boosting Indias energy security and boosting Russias access to the most important long term growth market. Bloomberg",2016-10-17,oMDuiVNGQqQXrS5QCOYSKM,"With the Essar Oil deal, Rosneft is targeting the Indian market which is forecast to be the worlds fastest-growing oil consuming nation through 2040",both,12:27,Rosnefts Essar Oil deal takes Russias turf war to Middle East backyard

Apart from Ant Financial, Chinas internet giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings Ltd have already invested in Indian tech companies, it said. Smaller players and even start-ups in China are rushing to India as they see the country as the next frontier in internet-based businesses and a promising market for them to replicate Chinese tech giants success stories, it said. While the Chinese investors look to flock to India to cash on the fast growing e-commerce market, there are also anxieties among Chinese investors over growing calls for boycott of Chinese goods in India following Chinas blocking of Indias move to ban Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) chief Masood Azhar at the UN and blocking Indias bid to become the member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG). Chinese officials said Chinas investment in India currently touched about $3 billion, which Indian officials said not much compared to the potential. Quoting a report from itjuzi.com, a website dedicated to data on tech investments, the report said India has emerged as one of the most popular destinations for Chinese tech investors, second only to the US. In the first half of 2016, Chinese internet giants and venture capital firms invested more than 42.1 billion yuan ($6.26 billion) in 60 tech-related projects overseas, including 10 in India and 33 in the US. India will be the next big internet market after China, said Eric Shu, a senior partner with the Hangzhou-based venture capital firm InCapital. We believe many successful business models in Chinas internet industry can be copied in India, Shu said, adding that as Chinas economic growth slows, Chinese investors are looking for opportunities abroad. A recent report from Forrester Research Inc. said metropolitan cities in India and China are progressive pioneers that lead the demand for product and experience innovation in the Asia-Pacific region. The Indian market is similar to that of Chinas in many respects. Li Tao, chief executive officer (CEO) of the Beijing-based Apus Group which provides launchers, browsers and other apps for mobile phones running on the Android operating system, said Indias mobile internet market is at a stage where Chinas was three to five years ago. Unlike people in the US and China who gradually made the transition from using personal computers to access the internet to using mobile devices for the purpose, Indians do not need to go through the process. They can directly jump into the era of mobile internet, he said. Founded in 2014, Apus Group expects to have 80 million users in India by the year-end. The company set up a venture capital fund in late 2015 with its partners. With an initial investment of three billion rupees ($45 million), the fund focuses on investing in Indian mobile internet startups. For investors such as Apus, India is unique in the sense that millions of Indians already use smartphones for online shopping, communications, banking, news, entertainment, ticketing, bill payments, education, so on, the report said. The aggressive expansion of Chinese smartphone makers in India has been fuelling the trend. Chinese firms sell affordable handsets in India that are popular among millions of consumers, the report said. The promising future aside, Indias poor finance infrastructure and the low per-capita income make it difficult to earn good returns on investment in the near term, said industry insiders. There are several business models for apps to make profit. But Indian netizens are not ready to pay for services yet.

0.4,"New Delhi: As part of a strategy to reduce its electricity bills, Indian Railways plans to award tenders worth around Rs8,000 crore to set up a dedicated electricity transmission network.
				   
				The national transporter, which announced a Rs41,000 crore cost-saving exercise earlier this week, will award six tenders. Four transmission links will be set up through the public-private partnership route, and two by Indian Railways itself.The transmission play by Indias largest electricity consumer comes in the backdrop of Indian Railways buying  electricity directly from suppliers of its choice rather than state electricity boards (SEBs). It also has a 1,000-megawatt captive power plant at Nabinagar, Bihar.We plan to set up a country-wide electricity transmission network, said a railway ministry official on condition of anonymity.For starters, these transmission links will be between Mughal Sarai-Howrah; Delhi-Chennai; Delhi-Mumbai; Mumbai-Howrah; Chennai-Mumbai; and Chennai-Howrah.ALSO READ | Railways plans Rs1.3 trillion capital expenditure in 2017-18Indian Railways has been buying electricity directly from suppliers after being allowed to do so by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC), Indias apex power sector regulator (Bihar and West Bengal have challenged the CERCs order in the appellate tribunal for electricity). However, it is still dependent on state transmission networks to transmit electricity. Major international railway networks have their own electricity transmission network. This is primarily driven by the need for reliability and the unique electricity load requirement for  railways. The need gets much more pressing given our growing focus on improving the speed of trains, said the rail ministry official cited above.Indian Railways needs a so-called shifting load as a locomotive moves from one point to the other. An increase in speed will help the carrier reduce congestion on its networks, which in turn will help improve its revenue from freight and passenger traffic.ALSO READ | Sharp decline in bank loans to infrastructure sectorAshwani Kapoor, member, traction, Railway Board, confirmed the development and said the railways had moved the first tender for a transmission link between Mughal Sarai and Howrah.In 2014-15, the total energy cost of Indian Railways was Rs31,220 crore. This included expenditure of Rs10,436 crore towards electric traction, which carries about two thirds of the total freight, and about 50% of passenger traffic and Rs2,199 crore for non-traction usage such as manufacturing units, workshops and station areas.The bids will be awarded on the framework already developed and adopted by Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. Each tender will have an order value of around Rs500-1,000 crore and will have a two-stage bid process comprising a qualification stage and a price-bid stage, said the rail ministry official.Experts say a dedicated transmission system will allow Indian Railways more flexibility and independence in its electricity load management.For railways it will make sense. Electricity is a big spend. But while this  will help the railways, it also showcases the failure of implementation of open access policy in the right spirit, said Abhishek Poddar, partner and head, energy and process industries, AT Kearney India.Railway minister Suresh Prabhu on Tuesday unveiled a plan to save Rs41,000 crore over 10 years through an integrated energy management system.

				Tata Sons, which has a 73.26% stake in TCS, nominated Ishaat Hussain, a Tata group veteran, as the interim chairman of the company with immediate effect. Thus, Mistry ceases to be chairman of the TCS board, the company said in a stock exchange statement on Thursday.Separately, Tata Sons has requested a shareholder meeting of Indian Hotels Co. Ltd (IHCL) to pass a resolution for the removal of Mistry as director. On 4 November, IHCLs independent directors unanimously backed Mistrys board position as chairman.This could mark the beginning of a protracted battle,  analysts said.Also read: Did Tata Sons violate insider trading norms?According to the articles of association of TCS, as long as Tata Sons (and associates) holds at least 26% of the firm, the holding company has the right to nominate the chairman of the board of directors.People close to Mistry have questioned TCSs move, saying that Tata Sons has the right to only nominate a candidate.TCS had to then convene a board meeting and table the nomination at the board at a meeting or through a circular resolution. Nothing of this nature was done. In pre-meditated haste, by a letter of the same date, TCS has directly gone on to announce that Mistry stands replaced, one of the people said.A TCS spokesperson said the due process was followed. Under Article 90 of the articles of association of the company, the majority shareholders of Tata Sons are vested with the power to nominate the chairman. Accordingly, it informed all the board directors that Hussain is being nominated as the chairman, the spokesperson said. Sumit Agrawal, partner, Suvan Law Advisors, said that under the Companies Act, where articles of association specifically and categorically provide a right to a major shareholder or group of shareholder to nominate a chairman, exercising that right effectively removes the incumbent with immediate effect till a regular appointment of someone else through a shareholder resolution is made.The concept of shareholders right in the modern corporate world denotes the shareholders supremacy in the governance of the business and the affairs of the corporate sector either directly or through their elected representatives, said Agrawal.These shareholders, he pointed out, have certain statutory rights which nobody can take away, except in accordance with prescribed norms under articles and provisions of the Companies Act.That said, the process followed in TCS to nominate a new chairman neednt necessarily be followed in other group companies. Thats because the method of appointment or removal of chairman is incorporated in the articles of association of a company. In Tata Motors, for instance, the right to appoint the chairman lies with the board and not Tata Sons.Also read: Is trust deficit widening on Tatas narrative on Cyrus Mistry?For removing Mistry as a director, shareholder approval is needed and the request for an extraordinary general meeting in TCS by Tata Sons points to that.Under the provisions of the Companies Act, anyone holding at least 10% of a company can call for a shareholders meeting and propose a special resolution to remove directors before the end of their tenure.Amit Tandon, founder and managing director of Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS), a proxy advisory firm, said that the latest move marks the beginning of Tata Sons moving shareholder resolutions to remove Mistry from the board of operating companies.In the case of TCS, as they have more than 70% stake, they are quite confident of pulling it through, he said.In other Tata group operating companies where Mistry is chairman, Tata Sons (plus other group companies that have cross-holdings) owns a 30-35% stake.In Tata Chemicals, whose board met on Thursday, it has only a 29.98% ownership.To pass a resolution supporting the removal of Mistry as director, the Tatas will need a 51% majority. Thus, the role of institutional shareholders, particularly Life Insurance Corp. of India, becomes important.The state-owned insurer holds around 13% each in Tata Steel Ltd and Tata Power, and 10% in Tata Global Beverages Ltd.The vote of institutional investors will be decisive. Perhaps, this is a reason why Tata Sons has come out with a detailed statement today explaining its need to replace Mr. Mistry and also rejecting claims made by him in his letter to the Board of Tata Sons, said a statement by InGovern Research Services Pvt. Ltd.Hussains nomination comes on the heels of a snub the promoters faced on 4 November when independent directors unanimously backed Mistrys board position at Indian Hotels, which owns the Taj group. On Thursday, the independent directors of Tata Chemicals too backed Mistry.Interestingly, Hussain, who is also on the board of Tata Sons, abstained from voting to remove Mistry as chairman of the holding company in its 24 October board meeting.",2016-11-10,oQZzLk3MfdxNik2CRdYXGM,"Tata Sons, which has a 73.26% in TCS, has nominated Ishaat Hussain, a long-time Tata group veteran, as the interim chairman of TCS with immediate effect",company,08:42,"Tata Sons seeks Cyrus Mistrys removal from TCS, IHCL boards"

				State-run Indian Oil Corp. wants to buy assets globally to ensure a tenth of its refining capacity is fed by crude that is either from its own oil field or from assets where it has a stake, Chairman B. Ashok said in an interview on Monday. That goal will require the company to boost oil production 10-fold to about 210,000 barrels a day in the next eight years. There is a lot of potential production from our existing blocks, Ashok said in his office in New Delhi, referring to the blocks it holds in Africa, Latin America and the US. We are also looking at economics and seeing where the assets are available.Indian Oil, the nations biggest company by sales, and other state companies are increasing global acquisitions to secure energy supplies and meet demand thats expected to double by 2040. The biggest oil sector downturn in a generation opened a window for the energy hungry Indian companies to snap up assets as oilfield operators looked to sell assets or take partners to share expenses.Diversifying geographiesThis is a good time for Indian companies to buy oil assets overseas, said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at InterfaxEnergys Global Gas Analytics in London. There could be potential interest in the Middle East and Africa, and opportunities in Latin American nations such as Brazil and Mexico as they seek foreign partnerships to boost output.China had similarly stepped up overseas oil and gas investments after the 2008 oil price crash, snapping up assets for $108 billion in the five years to 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Indias oil companies spent almost $6 billion buying stakes in Russian oil fields last year. Indian Oil is diversifying its search to other geographies and is evaluating offers from global oil companies that are looking to sell some of their assets to generate cash, Ashok said. He did not give details.There are lot of opportunities possibly on offer in Africa, Middle-East and South East Asia, he said. We are looking at these and if the prices are right, we will go for it.The companys shares, which have risen 55% in the past year, added 1.2% to Rs346.8 in Mumbai on Tuesday.Refinery expansionApart from oil production, the company also plans to increase refining capacity. It is building one of countrys biggest refinery-cum-petrochemicals complex on the western coast along with two other state-run oil companies. It will own 50% in the proposed project and is keen to bring in a foreign partner, Ashok said.Indian Oil plans to spend about Rs1.8 trillion ($26.2 billion) through 2022 to expand it refining capacity to over 100 million tons and build new pipeline and distribution infrastructure. The company currently processes 80.7 million tons of crude a year from its nine plants and two owned by its unit Chennai Petroleum Corp.

-0.01,"Mumbai/New Delhi: Global oil majors BP Plc and Rosneft PJSC are eyeing a piece of Indias $117 billion retail market for fossil fuels, threatening to shake up government-owned companies that have faced little competition for a decade.
				   
				BP has already secured licenses to open as many as 3,500 fuel stations in the worlds second most-populous nation. Rosneft gained access to about 2,700 pumps through last months acquisition of Essar Oil Ltd, which has plans to add 2,600 more outlets. Along with Reliance Industries Ltd and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, the private players will try to chip away at the dominant position of three state-owned enterprises that control 90% of market volume.Competition is expected to intensify with the entry and expansion of private players and multinational companies, said Rahul Prithiani, a Mumbai-based director at CRISIL, a unit of S&P Global Ratings. Private players and multinational companies are expected to increase their market share though government companies will probably still dominate given their vast network of fuel retailing stations, he said.Retail sales have become more viable for private-sector refiners ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modis government scrapped diesel-price controls two years ago. Pricing freedom coupled with record oil consumption as the number of trucks, cars and motorbikes multiply is helping India stand out as a country that global oil majors cant ignore.The Paris-based International Energy Agency predicts India will be the worlds fastest-growing oil consuming nation through 2040.This sort of growth they will not get anywhere, said Lalit Kumar Gupta, chief executive officer of Essar Oil. Europe is virtually saturated, there is hardly any growth. In the US there is tough competition. India is the only country which is growing and which is growing by a big number and they feel there is scope.Companies including Saudi Aramco and Frances Total SA have shown an interest in India, while existing players such as Shell are planning to expand their footprint, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said in June, flagging further reforms in the oil and gas sector. More fuel retailers will increase competition and benefit consumers, he said.This is Indias second attempt at deregulation. Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries had captured 14% of retail diesel sales and 7% of petrol sales in 2006, after the government deregulated prices more than a decade back. The company had to close down pumps after price caps were re-introduced.The October 2014 deregulation is an opportunity for Reliance Industries to re-enter the retail market and ramp up volumes, according to the companys latest annual report. RIL plans to launch aggressive customer acquisition programs to quickly regain targeted market share, it said.Reliance Industries has re-secured over 4.5% of sales to bulk users of diesel, such as railways and state-operated bus services, the company said. It has opened about 1,100 stations so far, with plans to increase the number to 1,400 by March.Rising consumptionIndias fuel demand grew 11%in the year ended 31 March, the fastest pace in records going back to fiscal 2001. Consumption expanded 8% in the first half of the financial year that started 1 April, according to the oil ministrys Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell.BP sees a strong future for transportation fuels in India, the British oil major said in an emailed statement last week. We are keen to be involved in this market and contribute to its development.Still, private players have a long battle on their hands given the dominating position of the three government-owned companies, Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd, which together operate almost 53,000 fuel stations in India.If we compare with 10 years ago when private players had come, since then the state-run oil marketing companies are much better prepared, said Sanjiv Singh, head of refineries at Indian Oil, the countrys biggest fuel retailer. It will definitely bring in efficiency. The challenge before us is that while private players target the very-prime market, our commitment is to feed the total market.International companies may first make a dent in the large-scale industrial and commercial market, since public-sector companies have established themselves at prime locations for fuel pumps, Vikas Halan, vice president at Moodys Investors Service, said by phone.Thats where the competition heats up with the foreign players, he said.

Prices of crude oila key ingredienthave begun to harden and the impact would start reflecting on Nerolacs balance sheet, said managing director H.M. Bharuka. However, akin to larger rival Asian Paints Ltd, the company is also of the view that the decision to take a price hike will depend on how sharply input costs rise and the rate at which the goods and services tax (GST) is implemented. Nerolac registered double-digit volume growth in the decorative and automotive segments. On the flip side, the performance of its industrial and coating segment was a dampener. Demand is low because liquidity is tight, hence it has been our conscious decision to curtail sales in this segment and we dont see an improvement for the next six-nine months, added Bharuka. As far as outlook for the decorative and automotive segments is concerned, both are expected to continue to grow at the current rate, but the former is poised to see faster growth than the latter, given the strong demand. There is still no clarity on GST rates and that may lead to people postponing their decision to buy a car, so the automotive segment may see slower pace of growth, explained Bharuka.

Power Grids net profit grew by an impressive 33% in the June quarter, though capacity additions lagged Street estimates. NTPC clocked strong volumes, while hydro power generator NHPC Ltd saw healthy revenue growth, thanks to incentive income.
				   
				Performances of private power firms Tata Power Co. Ltd and Adani Power Ltd, on the other hand, continued to be affected by one-offs. Adverse orders at its Mumbai business and cost under-recovery at the Mundra plant dented Tata Power profit. Adani Power was hit by low generation and revenue.Reliance Power Ltds revenue fell slightly from a year ago. JSW Energy Ltds numbers were boosted by the acquisition of hydro power assets; otherwise, the firm continues to see pressure on realizations. CESC Ltd reported a steady performance. Revenue rose 12%, helped by better power off-take in Kolkata distribution. But profit remained flat due to high fuel costs.Overall, public sector utilities drove earnings. Private firms are seeing incremental positives, such as CESCs Chandrapur plant tying up a power purchasing agreement (PPA), JSW Energy Ltd getting short listed for a Karnataka PPA and Adani narrowing losses.But the firms are yet to reach a stage where their earnings will begin to see positive momentum. For instance, Adani Power and Tata Powers compensatory tariff issues for their plants are yet to be settled; CESCs Chandrapur plant still has free capacities that need to be tied up and PPA finalization for JSW Energy is awaited. So, despite inexpensive valuations of private firms, analysts continue to prefer state power utilities.NTPC faces demand concerns and Power Grid faces project commissioning worries. But the issues are seen to be transitory and the firms are preferred for steady financial performance. We believe NTPCs PLFs (plant load factors) will be impacted, to an extent, as we enter a seasonally weak quarter for thermal power.

				Whats striking about the data is that this represents a year-on-year growth of just 0.3%, suggesting growth in inflows from IT have practically dried up. As the chart alongside shows, growth has come off substantially compared to pre-crisis levels, when growth rates averaged over 30%.But it must be noted that the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBIs) data shows FY16 gross inflows from computer services of around $74 billion, while Nasscom puts the industrys revenues at $108 billion in the year till March 2016. Besides, while Nasscom estimated FY16 growth at 10.3% in dollar terms, RBI data puts growth in inflows at merely 1.4%. Growth in gross inflows, of course, need not be the same as growth in IT sector export revenues.Having said that, its true that growth rates of IT exports have come down substantially, as is evidenced in the September quarter results of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd. Indias IT industry is set to grow in single digits this fiscal year, its weakest performance since the global financial crisis. Based on TCS and Infosyss comments, growth is likely to be in the 7-8% range. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a recent note to clients, At present, Indian IT Industry faces three broad headwinds: (1) weak IT spends in financial services and healthcare verticals coupled with rise in insourcing or expansion of captives by select financial services clients, (2) deflationary impact of automation on revenue. Automation savings built in large deals/renewals puts downward pressure on revenues; downward pressure on contract values has been an ongoing pattern but has accelerated in the past 12-18 months, and (3) lack of adequate participation in digital.

0.3,"The December quarter results of Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T), a proxy for the state of Indias investment demand, was disappointing. It was all the more so, as it had turned in a vibrant performance for the September quarter. What is likely to dampen investor sentiment is the managements decision to lower growth guidance to 8-10% for the full year ending March, from the earlier forecast of 12-15%. And even that appears to be an uphill task for the juggernaut.
				   
				The firms December quarter results surprised the Street negatively. Net revenue grew 1.4% to Rs26,287 crore from a year ago, which fell short of Bloombergs average estimate by a significant 11%. One could blame it on demonetisation, to some extent.The impact was felt the most in the infrastructure segment, which comprises over three-fourths of L&Ts revenue. The management said in its media release that clearance delays and the abrupt liquidity crunch at the customers end hindered work progress.Meanwhile, toll revenue was down, too. So were real estate sales. Yet, the segments revenue grew by 6%, with a robust contribution from its international projects.Thats not all. L&Ts power segment is battling a dwindling order book. Revenue fell by 23% year-on-year (y-o-y). Also, the other smaller engineering segments and information technology (IT) did little to enthuse investors.But L&Ts 9.6% operating margin matched investor expectation and was a neat 140 basis points (bps) higher than the year-ago period. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Stringent working capital management and cost-cutting exercises did the trick. In this respect, the infrastructure segment delivered a respectable 110 bps y-o-y rise, even as the hydrocarbons, heavy engineering and electrical and automation segments pulled up their socks.However, both operating profit and net profit fell short of the average brokerage estimates. Yet, the consolidated net profit was about 39% higher y-o-y at Rs972.5 crore, not a bad deal considering the macroeconomic challenges.The moot question is, will L&T meet its guided revenue and order inflow target?On the revenue front, the firm will have to ramp up execution in the fourth quarter to match even the watered down 10% growth in annual revenue. Thanks to customer delays after the currency ban, the work at many sites was almost at a standstill. These have to gain traction again. Meanwhile, segments such as IT could clock slower revenue growth.On order inflows, the challenge is no less. December-quarter order inflow was 10% lower, with a third coming in from overseas. Again, given its run-rate at the end of nine months, the firm has to clock at least Rs50-60,000 crore to meet the guided annual target. Not impossible, given that the fourth quarter is the lumpiest on order inflows, but a Herculean task, too.In fact, L&Ts results convey that all is not well in the economy.Domestic growth appears to take a longer time as investment momentum is weak and the banking system is burdened with a debt overhang, says the company's media release, adding that the challenging business conditions are likely to remain for a few more quarters.Infrastructure orders from the government are still delayed and private capex is yet to take off.L&Ts stock trades at Rs1,439 apiece, which discounts its one-year forward estimated earnings by a rich 21 times.In fact, since demonetisation, the stock, which has been a steady outperformer, has been volatile. Brokerages have trimmed both the expected earnings and valuations over the past few weeks.

-0.51,"Mumbai: Jan Janshen is managing partner at private equity (PE) fund Advent International Corp., which had $29 billion worth of assets under management by the end of 2015. In March, it completed raising $13 billion for its latest fund. 
				   
				Janshen co-heads Advents European operations and is one of the seniormost partners on the Asia Investment Committee, actively working on India deals. In an interview, he talks about Advents investments in India. Edited excerpts:Advent has been a late entrant in India compared to its global peers. While you did your first investment back in 2007 from your London office, you opened an India office only in 2009.I think our business evolves. We do global private equity and we do Asia out of our big flagship global fund. We are a true partnership; the consensus among the partners to set up an office here was evolving. One can debate if we are too early or late, I dont know.We dont only see deal-making, but we also see most importantly that we invest in international if not global companies. The mandate for the Mumbai office is not only doing deals but also help the global portfolio. India is a very key market which they look for market access or a place to manufacture things, sourcing or from supply side. Some of our portfolio companies have also made add-on acquisitions in India.You have only done four deals in the region while others such as TPG, KKR, Blackstone have raised Asia- or India-dedicated vehicles and have been extremely prolific. One would argue the capital allocation from Advent has been slow in the region and that India is not a key market for you.I would turn it differently. We are a true partnership, consensus model, and we try to take that slowly and do it steadily. Clearly, if you raise dedicated funds for the region, then the local team is under huge pressure from day one to put money at work in that region. Actually, what we have seen in our global fund, pre-crisis, post-crisis, and so on, that these regions and countries and sectors dont go in sync. So if you see, what we call dynamic capital allocation, the various funds and which sectors the money goes in and which countries, that can vary from fund to fund.Our model is that we have our own way to find businesses and build businesses. But then, we are agnostic where they are, which size they are; so thats why we felt the advantage of having a Mumbai office as part of the global fund which gives us the benefits of building sustainable businesses without being under pressures.But your capital allocation pattern suggests its pretty much spread across Europe, America taking chunk (40% each) and remaining, about 20%, coming to Asia?We have 180 investment professionals globally, and we have five chosen sectors that we like globally for investments and all of the colleagues look globally for investments. We have no macro overlay. When our investors ask us the same question, what is your capital allocationEurope, the US, Germany, Asiawe dont have. But then, they ask us you must have sector allocationhealthcare, TMT, industrialswhich also we dont have. We have a different way of doing what an Advent deal is. And when we find these deals, we do them irrespective of where they are.So, there is no portfolio construction where we say X% has to go somewhere. What ends up happening is that somewhere 40 Europe, 40 West and 20 Asia, that more happens, but we are not being prescriptive or aiming for these.Clearly in the healthcare space, we have invested in generics quite a bit. Of course, you have the Mumbai team on board, and if you take the global centre of excellence for generics it is in India.How important is India as a market for you?Clearly, very important because its a very big market and fast growing. It is relevant not only from a domestic perspective but also from an international perspective. When we started setting up a team here, building an office, we took a long term view. Currently, the outlook is great if you see various metrics: the stock markets, M&A volumes, the GDP, the wealth being created and so on.On a relative basis, if you compare developed and developing market, India definitely stands out. Lot of the acronyms that emerged such as BRICS vanished but the shining spot globally is clearly India. There is a lot of progress both on the political side and the value being created in this economy.Does that mean you will enhance your commitment here?We are very committed to the region. We are fundamentally oriented and not financial engineers. We really look for companies which have a strong earnings profile. We invest at a sensible valuation with a sensible governance in place and I wouldnt mind putting a billion at work in India. We have a global $13 billion fund, so there is no reason why we wouldnt put a billion at work in Mumbai. We have a successful great team. Shweta (Shweta Jalan is the India head for Advent) is a global partner in the partnership.I think we have all the right ingredients: so the team wouldnt stop us, the capital wouldnt stop us and like in any market, we need to find the right opportunities.Deal-making has become very competitive, with almost every major global PE firm having an India presence now. What is your uniqueness?We would do investments from 100 million to $1 billion which is a fairly unusual size. Because typically what you do is that you have a PE fund and you divide it by 20 which is the average size of the deal and you add and subtract a little and that range becomes your sweet spot. We are completely different as we dont care whether its $100 million or a billion in equity or which country it is  we are attracted by the opportunity.Also, what you see in a lot of private equity firms is that the dominating factor is the office. Where the company is headquartered, that office works on it. We are different. So, if you have a healthcare deal here, the healthcare team from London and Boston are in here. If you look at the cement deal, then clearly the building materials team is on board.We are thrilled whenever we find an interesting deal and thats what keeps us going. Also, we set up the investment committees closer to the region. Our structure doesnt have a CEO, no CIO. We are a true partnership that works in consensus. We also have investment committees which are close to the region. So, you dont have to go to NY Investment committee where nobody knows the local fundamentals, governance, the rule of law etc.So, would we see Advent doing more deals in India?Of course. If you look at the size of the funds, we have been fortunate and successful that our funds were bigger than the last funds and were heavily oversubscribed. As the funds grow, we all have to invest more. PE on the whole is a growth industry. When I joined Advent 17 years ago, we were investing out of a billion dollar fund or something like that. We are now $30 billion assets under management and we raised our last fund at $13 billion in six months and couldnt even talk to outside investors much because there was so much demand. Because our firm is growing strongly, we need to do more everywhere. The question is not if, but a question is how much more the teams can do.",2016-10-02,owQCaeyt7xj8nRBbYeGGGI,"Jan Janshen, managing partner at Advent International, says the private equity fund looks for companies which have a strong earnings profile",competitor,23:15,Advent wouldnt mind putting $1 billion at work in India: Jan Janshen
-0.06,"Mumbai: Shankar Sharma, vice-chairman and joint managing director of First Global Securities Pvt. Ltd, is known for his strong and contrarian views. He thinks that the demonetisation exercise will affect larger companies more than smaller ones. Edited excerpts from an interview:
What do you make of the unexpected set of events, Brexit, demonetization and Donald Trumps win, that impacted Indian markets?I would not say the events were unexpected. After the great financial crisis, extremist politics has become popular across the world, be it Modis win here or Trumps win in the US.I think by now, we should be used to weird things happening. I think 2008 was a watershed moment for the world, not only because of the financial crisis, but because of the impact it had on peoples mindset and psychology. It hit them hard that they lost their jobs, their savings dwindled and so on. They were then willing to gamble with their politics, or take a blind, under-analysed bet on anyone who promised them these basics. People have been hurt widely since 2008they are angry, bewildered why their perfect lives suddenly went badand smart politicians across the world have leveraged on this by showing easy cures and fantasy fixes. The extremist politics is just peoples answer of their outrage to why us? That is what also led to events that we saw in 2016.How do you see 2017 panning out for Indian markets?I am very negative on large cap (stocks) in India in light of the recent demonetization. I was tepid about them before. I am, however bullish on Indian small cap stocks and micro-cap stocks.Demonetization has been a big, big shock to companies earnings and economic growth. The near-term impact is significant. I do not hold out much hope for large caps in terms of their ability to recover quickly. Banks will be the hardest hit as there is no credit offtake and (there is) a slowdown in demand. It may even hit recovery of loans, and even add marginally to non-performing assets.Why are you bullish on small caps and micro-cap stocks?They dont necessarily have to bank on government or strong domestic economic growth per se. Small companies can find a niche area, a good product or they find demand from a specific industry. So, I find many of those attractive bets in small and micro space. Some of those companies have corrected, and valuations are pretty attractive.Where do Indian equities stand vs emerging market peers in 2017?Before demonetization, I was reasonably optimistic on India outperforming emerging markets or at least performing in line with them. India was going to stand a little behind commodity-producing markets, which had rallied on the back of a recovery in commodity prices. There was, however, a good monsoon after two bad years, and consumption was finally looking up. There was general optimism on earnings growth, which has been very tepid in the last few quarters.However, post demonetization, things have turned bad, at least for a few quarters. I think India is now going to lag other emerging markets in 2017.Whatever tepid growth rate we were seeing, that also is in question right now. Also, post a shock like that, while people say it will hurt the economic growth for one or two quarters, the point is nobody knows. Macroeconomics is not arithmetical. It is not like I give x input and y output is delivered. Sometimes, it may happen, sometimes it may not, and sometime a completely un-modelled thing may happen.It is very clear that the economic growth momentum is broken. How does it come back, how much you need to stimulate for it to come back and whether we have the firepower to stimulate that much, we do not know. So, suddenly from being reasonably okay position, we are in a situation where we need to invest hugely to repair the damage.If you are thirsty, you drink a glass of water. But if you are dehydrated, you need to be put on the drip. Now, the stimulus has to be disproportionate to the loss the economy is suffering. Does the government have that ammo?Do you think demonetisation was a wrong move by the government?That is not a call I can take. It is for the government to make these decisions.Do you think there are more negatives than positives from it?If you want to look at it from the lens of politics, I think it is a terrific move. If you look at it from the economic or financial lens, its a very muddled picture. For a government in power, the objective is to win elections at any cost. If this helps them achieve this, I think it is all okay, because ultimately like an asset management companys sole purpose of existence is to gather assets, the sole purpose of a political party is to win elections. Period. Performance etc. are all secondary.The goods and services tax is set to be implemented next year. How do you see things shaping up post its implementation?Even before demonetization, the general consensus has been that there will be a near-term impact of adjustment and understanding of GST on economic growth. There are various factors that come into play when a big change like this is introduced. So, even without demonetization, it would have had a significant near-term impact in terms. Now, post demonetization, we are looking at a double whammy to the economy in the immediate future after its implementation.What is your budget wishlist ?I am not a big budget analyst or a big budget watcher. In my view, Indian budgets are generally fairy tales and I dont believe in fairy tales. I dont waste my time analysing it. I think it is just a statement of intent. I dont listen to what they (government) say, I only watch what they do.Private investment demand has not revived for a long time. What is the missing piece that can help revive this?This government has decided as the Big Brother that I will do the all the spending in the economy because I know better than an individual consumer as to where to spend.So, if you see all the economic auctionsall money flows to the government that obviously gives them the power on how low the pricing for telecom etc. can gothe government has decided the economy belongs to them, and not the citizens; and they will decide how economic gains are spent, not the citizens.As we enter 2017, which sectors do you really like in Indian markets, and which sectors would you avoid?The one sector I will definitely avoid is banks. Banks have been over-owned in India. In such a situation, upside usually gets capped. After demonetization, private lenders will suffer as consumption hits a hurdle. Public sector banks that primarily lend to industries were, as it is, going through bad times.

0.55,"When Anoop Kumar Sharma quit state-owned Shipping Corp. of India Ltd (SCI) in 2008 as senior vice-president overseeing the chartering operations after three decades with the Mumbai-based firm and joined Essar Shipping Ltd, he would never have imagined returning to his former employer as chairman and managing director.
				   
				Eight years hence, this is what has happened.A government that is open to trying out private talent in a company that runs ships where quick decision-making means a lot, cleared the path for Sharma to take a shot at the top post.While contemporaries and colleagues give him the thumbs up, it is not clear he would have got the top job at Shipping Corp. had he stayed on because appointments there merely went by seniority.A little before he left SCI, Sharma lost out due to the lack of seniority on becoming a director for bulk carriers and tankers at the company when interviews were held by the Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB), the government headhunter. He impressed the PESB, but the much senior K.S. Nair got the job.In a way, selecting Sharma, seen as a lifetime SCI man, would be a motivating factor for the rank and file of SCI. Bringing a rank outsider could have been a de-motivating factor for people who work for the company.It was not that the government has now hand-picked Sharmait ran a proper selection process by inviting applications, short-listing candidates, conducting interviews and securing approval from the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC). Sharma was one among the eight who were interviewed by a panel headed by Indias cabinet secretary.In a way, Sharma, who started his career at Shipping Corp., has seen the best of both the worlds. The rigid and often time-consuming decision-making process that characterized state-owned firms, keeping government oversight bodies such as the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) and the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in mind, on the one hand, and the greater operational freedom in the other.Whether Sharma can put his eight years in a private shipping company to good use at Shipping Corp. remains to be seen. Because, running a shipping company, a government-owned one at that, is a different ball game altogether.For instance, despite being a so-called navratna company, a tag that allows state-owned firms greater freedom from government control, Shipping Corp. just does not have the flexibility to buy used or second-hand vessels and sell ships for further trading, which is a normal part of the shipping business globally.Asset play requires taking quick decisions.There are times when selling a ship makes much more commercial sense rather than operate it at rates that dont even allow recovery of operating costs. This is one of the ways fleet owners shore up their financials in a depressed freight market. SCI, once a target for privatization during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, had never sold a ship for further trading since starting operations 54 years ago. Successive chairmen and managing directors (CMDs) have been reluctant to take a call on selling trading ships (which can be run for many more years) due to fear of agencies such as CVC, CAG and the Central Bureau of Investigation.If CMDs are given immunity from such oversight bodies, the company would be able to improve its efficiency and profitability by several notches. Similarly, buying second-hand ships requires securing time-consuming government approvals.Since April 2013, SCI had cancelled orders for building 12 new ships after shipyards jumped delivery dates. This allowed the company to preserve cash between 2011 and 2014 when it reported three consecutive years of losses.Shipping Corp. needs to re-deploy Rs.330.65 crore of refund money received from the shipyards on order cancellations which were originally part of the proceeds of the follow-on public offer (FPO) in November 2010. This money can only be used for buying ships because that was one of the purposes of the follow-on public offer.For close to a year now, the company has been looking for at least six second-hand ships but managed to buy just one shipan offshore oil exploration support vessel from a subsidiary of Indias The Great Eastern Shipping Co. Ltd. With ship prices at record lows, buying ships at low prices would help when the market picks up.Last week, the company issued a tender for buying a 7-11 year old suezmax tanker (called so because it can transit the Suez Canal fully laden) which can carry as much as 160,000 tonnes of crude oil. In the private sector, whether in India or abroad, ship acquisitions, both new buildings and second-hand, are never through tenders; they are always done through negotiations.Sharma will have to contend with such restrictions unless the government decides to ease them in the larger goal of professionalizing SCI.In much the same way as Shipping Corp., the government could consider hiring professionals from the private sector to run some of its state-owned ports that have always remained a fiefdom of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS).P.

What motivated you to start your philanthropic journey and where did you go for advice?I belong to the breed of first-generation entrepreneurs who have basically created our enterprises with very frugal resources. Being in a field like healthcare, for me as someone who is basically on a mission to make a global impact in terms of affordable access to healthcare, I am very, very concerned about the fact that there are a large number of people in this world who need to have some access to basic rights, whether it is in education or healthcare. This is a huge global challenge which I think every one of us who has been fortunate enough to create the kind of wealth we have created, needs to do something about.Inherently I have a social conscience which my late father inculcated in me. He was not exactly a very wealthy man but he was very concerned about the underprivileged, about the people who didnt have equal opportunities.Can you talk about your portfolio of philanthropic works? You mentioned you work in cancer, and initiated work in diabetes.My philanthropy is largely focused on healthcare and I really want to make a difference to peoples lives. The poor are absolutely neglected and they are abused in many ways, because the system just totally ignores their needs, so I have also sort of allocated some part of my philanthropy funds to primary healthcare. In primary healthcare again, I want to use technology in a big way, because I feel that we have got to leapfrog if we have to make any difference to society. I have helped to create what are called ilaaj (diagnosis) clinics and we use technology to diagnose early so that you can treat early and the outcomes become better.These are experimental times but for me philanthropy is about catalyzing a process. It is not about doing the governments job, which very often the government believes is what philanthropy is. I dont ascribe to that at all. I believe that in philanthropy, there are certain things where you can make a big difference like you know building hospitals where you can actually deliver affordable healthcare. I think the government needs to partner with philanthropists and with corporate social responsibility to experiment with new ideas, and that is a form of philanthropy that can really transform.For you, what has translated from your for-profit experience into your philanthropy?Philanthropy has to be sustainable, and thats why I will make a big distinction between charity and philanthropy. Charity has generally a sort of temporary effect and is about giving fish to a hungry man rather than teaching a person how to fish. Philanthropy changes somebody elses life in a meaningful way.How is new philanthropy different from traditional philanthropy?I think old wealth understands philanthropy and they do have a lot of philanthropic programmes to show for it, like in the case of the Birlas or Tatas. They do have a lot to show in terms of philanthropic outcomes; they have created educational institutes, hospitals and other kind of institutions. New wealth takes time to understand what philanthropy is about, because when you create new wealth, your first immediate reaction is I got to make sure that I keep that wealth for a rainy day.What can be done to stimulate philanthropy in India?Philanthropy is about setting an example and I think many of us first-generation entrepreneurs who have built very successful businesses have come together under the India Philanthropy Initiative (IPI) that Mr (Azim) Premji started. Ratan Tata was also one of the co-conspirators. I would say that many of us who belong to IPI, like Nandan and Rohini Nilekani, are like-minded people when it comes to philanthropy. We all believe that every generation has to create new wealth and the wealth that you have created, a large part of it must go back into making the society better, to make a difference to the ones who have been wronged in the society. Every one of us who has created this kind of wealth in India in recent times has demonstrated a social conscience, whether it is Infosys or Wipro, or Biocon.What advice do you give to the new philanthropists who are early in their journey?I always tell people to ask themselves: where do you think you can make a difference and why do you want to make that difference. New philanthropists tend to feel overwhelmed by the needs of society. How do you decide to focus on certain things and say no to other things?Its not just about being a new philanthropist. Even seasoned philanthropists get absolutely bombarded by requests. Everyone comes with great ideas and how wonderful their initiative is and why you should be helping them. As a philanthropist, you have to be very clear on what you are trying to do. If something that is being done actually aligns with what you are doing, then it is very clear that you can actually help this person. But more often most requests dont quite align with what you are trying to do, so it is very easy to say no. Personally I back ideas where I know that the person is very passionately involved with that initiative because again it is about sustainability. Youve got to have ownership of what you are doing.What can strengthen Indian philanthropy?I believe that investing in incubators and accelerators through an angel investment is also extremely important, provided that you are not looking for a return on that investment and are prepared to reinvest whatever returns you make on such investments. To me as a first-generation entrepreneur I know how tough it is to build a business and to scale it up, so I think philanthropic funds should also help others to build social businesses.What are the things that you do to be able to delegate in your philanthropy?You do need to make sure that you build a philanthropic organization or an administrative cell that really looks at your philanthropy very objectively. In most of my kind of philanthropic initiatives, I have really invested in such a way that I leave it to the investees to really take my philanthropy forward. For instance, at the hospital project, I just leave it to the administration of the hospital to make sure that they leverage what I have given them into a very big opportunity.ALSO READ | Govt policy should make it easier to give: Rohini NilekaniALSO READ | You really want to be doing things that make a difference: Ratan TataThe Bridgespan Group, an adviser and resource for mission-driven leaders and organizations, in partnership with Mint interviewed several philanthropists across India to trace their journeys and share their learningsConversations with Remarkable Givers: India.

-0.28,"Oil majors including Statoil, Shell and Chevron are experimenting with various technologies, from drones and drill design to data management, to drive down costs and weather a deep downturn. 
				   
				Crude prices have more than halved since mid-2014, forcing companies to cut billions of dollars in costs. Determined to shield dividends and preserve the infrastructure that will allow them to compete and grow if the market recovers, they are increasingly looking to smarter tech and design to make savings. French oil and gas major Total said it was now using drones to carry out detailed inspections on some of its oil fields following a trial at one of its Elgin/Franklin platforms in the North Sea. Cyberhawk, the drone company that led the trial, said this kind of work was previously carried out by engineers who suspended themselves from ropes at dizzying heights. It said the manned inspection used to take seven separate two-week trips with a 12-man team that had to be flown in and accommodated on site.The drones do the work in two days and at about a tenth of the cost, according to the UK-based firms founder Malcolm Connolly, who said it had also worked with ExxonMobil, Shell, ConocoPhillips and BP. Total declined to comment on how long the manned or drone inspections took, or specify how much money was saved.Statoils giant Johan Sverdrup field, the largest North Sea oil find in three decades, is a leading industry case study for cutting costs in the era of cheap oil.The firm has cut development costs for the first stage of the project by a fifth compared with estimates in early 2015, to 99 billion crowns ($12.2 billion). The savings have largely been made by focusing on the most efficient technology and designs from the beginning, Statoils technology head Margareth Oevrum, told Reuters in an interview. Executives say the growing attention on technologies that have been around for some time shows how wasteful the global industry had been in the years before the downturn.For example, simply finding a more efficient route for the oil pipeline that would carry the crude from the Sverdrup field to the onshore refinery cut 1 billion crowns, Statoil said. It has also developed a drilling template that is acting as a guide for the first eight wells to be drilled at the field. It said it had reduced the overall drilling time by more than 50 days, saving about 150 million crowns per production well.Global upstream oil and gas spending has fallen by more than $300 billion across the industry in 2015-16, according to the International Energy Agency. Around two-thirds comes from cost cuts, it said. Alex Brooks, oil and gas equity analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said tech innovation in the industry was about 100 tiny things, adding: The bottom line is you end up with a much lower cost.Another way firms are looking to cut costs is by using their vast amounts of data to better predict their needs. Since the price slump, firms such as Shell, ExxonMobil and Statoil have started using software to better manage their data to cut wastage in the ordering of construction materials. Gunnar Presthus, Nordic energy lead at consultancy Accenture, who advises oil majors and national oil firms, said the downturn had led to the industry waking up to the potential of the data they store. The oil industry, to some extent, is one of the most digitalized industries, he said. Companies are now able to use this wealth of data to make changes that will save money.",2016-10-17,pK4u37UCcXUpnNABQ8lkvL,"Crude prices have more than halved since mid-2014, forcing oil companies to cut billions of dollars in costs and look at smarter tech and design",company,01:50,Oil giants explore new technologies to cut costs

				Our world is being shaped by the intersection of multiple emerging as well as some entirely new technologies. Self-driving cars, drones and intelligent homes are already accepted as inevitable. In other industries, we might witness a shift to consumerization in energy, i.e. the way that energy is produced and distributed, relying heavily on naturally available sources, new storage methods and intelligent grids. We will see the dawn of an entirely new way of commerce, of transparency and efficiency enabled by technology. One doesnt have to look hard to find examples which show that technology is becoming core and inseparable from innovation in every industry. Artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, the Internet of Things, blockchain and many game-changing technologies are coming of age. At the same time, digital is becoming the de facto approach to buying products, services and experiences. The fast-moving landscape on both sides of demand and supply will make most 10-year predictions seem tame in hindsight.Thanks to its unique vantage point over the last three decades, the Indian IT industry has an opportunity to shape these global forces. It has earned its stripes based on the seemingly unassailable value proposition of cost, scale and quality. It has been successful in constantly reinventing service excellence across a broad range of technology, business processes and engineering services. However, this may no longer be enough. To win in the next decade, the industry may need, in some sense, to be an antithesis of the past. Past winning factors of cost, scale and predictability will need to pivot to value-based, agile and innovative, i.e. be true digital co-partners, while helping customers ruthlessly drive efficiencies in their operations. Innovation in AI and robotic process automation platforms and technologies will play a critical role in helping achieve almost unimaginable levels of automation. Winning in the new paradigm thus implies the need for a significant shift in capabilities, skill sets, delivery models and new relationships/partnerships. Capabilities are shifting from technology based to business solution oriented, skills from generalists to specialists with a broad range of expertise, delivery models from off-shore to agile and as a service based, and stakeholders are shifting from calling only on the chief information officer (CIO) to business, functional and IT. Workforce transformation through upskilling and multi-skilling will be essential in the new landscape. Working in cross-function agile teams, imbibing and practising design thinking will need to become second nature to a large majority of technology workers who have traditionally focused on narrow technical excellence.Developing leading-edge capabilities will require an almost boundary-less approach to developing IP (intellectual property) and solutions through an effective external ecosystema combination of investment and participation in innovation ecosystems such as start-ups, academia and venture capital ecosystems. While thats a lot of change to deal with in a short time frame, it is also an opportunity to create value on a much larger scale. India has a large and growing market for digital products and services and a start-up landscape. Government-led initiatives like Digital India can be real catalysts for the change, providing the impetus to leapfrog in innovation ahead of other, slower- growing economies.It will take a sense of purpose, a pioneering spirit and a start-up culture to realize this vision. At a time when globalization is facing some scepticism and headwinds, the industry can be a beacon of hope, showing the power of ideas, innovation and technology to create economic and social value across borders and without bias.

-0.43,"After a poor December quarter, earnings downgrades continue. 
				   
				The main culprits are public sector banks and commodity producers, but there are enough of them to pull down Nifty 50 estimates.Where there was great hope for an FY16 earnings rebound earlier in the year, now profits of Nifty firms are estimated to decline marginally. This naturally means that earnings growth estimates for FY17 will start looking bullish as the base (FY16 earnings) becomes smaller. Indeed, brokerage firms estimates for earnings growth in FY17 range between 14% and 21%. But as the table shows, even these estimates have been chopped continuously as the economy is still struggling on the ground, there is no real demand revival and deflation persists. Aggregate FY17 earnings estimates for Nifty 50 firms have been cut by 10.4% over the past six months, according to Investec Capital Services (India) Pvt. Ltd. This carnage has been widespread. Four out of five Nifty companies saw an earnings downgrade in the December quarter. Energy companies and financial institutions were the worst hit; the pace of downgrades has also accelerated in these industries, as the table shows.If that is not bad enough, many public sector banks have postponed recognition of some bad assets to the March quarter. Exports havent picked up and if the Union budget doesnt have some concrete steps to boost rural spending and increase capital expenditure, there wont be much succour for earnings over the next two-three quarters.Brokerage firms such as Investec Research expect another 10% downgrade in the FY17 earnings estimates for Nifty 50 companies.

-0.98,"New Delhi: The Union power ministry has told the influential goods and services tax (GST) Council chaired by finance minister Arun Jaitley that implementing GST in its current form could push up power generation cost, especially of renewable energy, which will further dent the ability of debt-ridden distribution companies to serve electricity unless specific relief measures are built in.
				   
				While solar panels and other equipment used for power production will come under GST, the final productelectricityhas been kept out. This means power producers will not be able to set off part of the indirect tax liability on their output using credit for the taxes already paid on raw materials and services availed.In a presentation made to the GST Council on 16 January, the power ministry proposed giving either deemed export status or zero GST rate for renewable power. The measures are intended to spare power producers from the tax cost of keeping electricity out of GST, and to compensate for the end of existing tax exemptions. According to a copy of the presentation, reviewed by Mint, the capital expenditure of renewable energy companieswind and solarcould go up by 10-12% which will warrant a power tariff increase by 30-40 paise for wind power and 40-50 paise for solar power. That is mainly because central excise duty exemptions and concessional state value added tax (VAT) on equipment and solar panels (0-5% levied by states) will make way for an 18% GST on the raw materials and services availed of by renewable power producers.According to M.S. Mani, senior director, indirect tax, Deloitte in India, about 350 goods are at present exempted from excise duty while VAT exemptions across states will add up to about 200 items. Under GST, there will be not more than 100 exemptions which means increased tax incidence on industries using items that lose benefit of exemption or concessional tax rate.The ministry has accordingly urged the council to either consider renewable power as a deemed export or merely assign a zero GST rate on clean energy, which will allow power producers to get refund of all the taxes previously paid on the raw materials and services. There is no excise duty on solar panels, but states levy 0-5% concessional VAT on them and there is a 2% central sales tax in case of inter-state supply.The ministry also proposed similar treatment for large hydropower projects, which will be reclassified as renewable energy projects.The power ministry said that there are few takers for high cost power at present. Any further tariff increase due to GST may have multiplier effect on economic development as there will be difficulty in passing through its impact to agriculture and domestic consumers, said the presentation. It also argued that higher power tariff will have an adverse impact on industrial production, GDP and the Make in India drive, in addition to impact on export competitiveness of products and services.The solar power industry is witnessing intense competition which has driven tariffs down from Rs.12 a kilo watt hour in 2010 to a historic low of Rs 3 in 2016, which means any cost escalation is likely to hurt them.There are more than 200 active players in this industry and it is heading for consolidation in the face of competition, said Inderpreet S.

				This is exactly what the valuations of Bharat Financial Inclusion Ltd (BFIL) seem to suggest.The stock trades at a price-to-book value multiple of 4.1 times its estimated earnings for fiscal year 2017, while HDFC Bank Ltd is trading at a multiple of 3.9.For those who feel this is like comparing apples with oranges, let us look at BFILs peers in the non-banking financial company space. In fact, rising financial conglomerates Bajaj Finance Ltd, mortgage lending behemoth Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC) and Repco Home Finance Ltd are the ones that are getting such high valuations.Still unconvinced with the comparison? BFILs former microfinance peer Equitas Holdings Ltd, which has morphed into a bank, is valued at 2.9 times its FY17 earnings. Another microfinance turned bank Ujjivan Financial Services Ltd is no different. At the surface, BFILs 87% growth in net profit for the September quarter, its over 50% growth in loan disbursals, an asset under management growth rivalling most peers and an envious asset quality support a premium price tag. The microlenders track record post the 2010 Andhra Pradesh debacle has been impressive. Even with scorching growth, there is a semblance of caution at the company. Gross non-performing assets were 0.1% of its loan book in the September quarter.Given that BFIL is the largest and the only listed microfinance lender, it is viewed as the only door for investors to enter into a sunrise sector with promising growth potential. But is it the only entrance? It is but a technicality that separates Equitas and Ujjivan from BFIL as these are morphing into banks. By nature of business, small finance banks can be viewed as microlenders too with an advantage of access to public deposits. Perhaps fatigue has already set in with BFILs stock down 5% to a one-month low now after running-up 50% between April and September. But the jury is still out with some analysts still having a buy rating. Those like Religare Capital Markets  Ltd that have a sell tag, rely on the riskiness of the sector to justify their call.

-0.57,"New Delhi: British Prime Minister Theresa Mays visit to India last week helped to spotlight Indias importance in India-UK trade as Britain looks to rebalance its commercial links with countries post Brexit, according to Patricia Hewitt, chair of the UK India Business Council. To boost investment, the India-UK CEO forum has suggested that the two governments look at a bilateral tax treaty, Hewitt said. Edited excerpts from an interview:
What are the major takeaways from PM Mays visit?It was very important indeed that PM May made India her first international bilateral destination. And I think that was very well recognised by our Indian friends. That said, two thingsone was that following the referendum on Brexit, India, which was already very important to the UK, is even more important. It has gone further up the Prime Ministers list of priorities. But there was a deeper message. There was I think a real fear on the part of our Indian friends and others in other parts of the world that the referendum meant Britain was turning inwards and even at the risk of becoming protectionist. And I think what PM May said here publicly and privately has put that fear to rest. She has made it very plain that Britain remains open for business and that Britain is not turning its back on Europe but is trying to rebalance its relationships around the world to give more importance to its non-European trading partners. I think there is a much better understanding between the two governments and critically between the two Prime Ministers on how to move forward.There seem to be many stress points in the relationshipwhether it is the Vodafone or Cairn India tax cases or Tatas plans to sell Corus. What is your view?I think the economic relationship is very strong. There are always issues in every bilateral relationship. I would say on the tax issue, of course two years ago there was the hope that those issues would be dealt with and put to rest. The Indian government for various reasons decided that wasnt possible. Those two cases are now in arbitration. They will run their course, there will be a decision. So if you like, its been factored in. At the CEOs forum meeting, there were some very constructive proposals for a possible bilateral tax treaty to create a modern framework, ensure that there is a right climate for investors and we get the maximum amount of capital coming in from the city of London directly into India. It the past, much of this has gone through Mauritius; some of it is going via Singapore now. Actually, lets have a bilateral tax treaty and deal with that issue. So actually, I would say there is less tension. The suggestion on the tax treaty came from the CEOs of both sides.Can you please elaborate a little more on the tax treaty proposal? Is there a timeline for when it should be in place?At this point, its a fairly new suggestion. It is to ensure for instance that investors dont find themselves subject to double taxation. Vodafone Plc is covered by a double taxation treaty with the Netherlands but there isnt one between India and the UK. And that is why so much British investment was routed via Mauritius and Singapore. There was a positive interest in the idea from the Indian (government) side. But bilateral tax treaties dont get negotiated overnight as you know. I think both governments were receptive to the idea.Whats the sentiment among British businesses vis-a-vis India?We recently did a survey of our membersBritish companies with an interest in Indiaand they were very positive about the reforms they had seen in the past two years, about the business environment in India and as a result, 60% of them were saying that they were more likely to increase their investment in India over the next couple of years. And that is a direct result of the improved business environment. When you look at what the Modi government has achieved in less than three years, it is very, very substantialone, the Ease of Doing Business and cooperative federalism.The introduction of GST (goods and services tax) is a major step.

				The social media company will become a more important player in maintaining Facebooks growth in advertising revenue in 2017. During the last two earnings calls, Facebook executives said they may soon reach a limit on the amount of ads they can place in front of users, which had been one of the key factors driving ad revenue growth.Media buyers are optimistic about Instagrams ability to maintain Facebooks place, second only to Alphabet Incs Google, in the digital ad marketplace. Instagram could end up being as strong a revenue component for Facebook as YouTube has been for Google, said Noah Mallin, head of social for North America at ad agency MEC.In Instagram Stories, users and businesses can post a string of photos and videos that disappear after 24 hours.

-0.34,"Mumbai: Dell Technologies chairman and chief executive officer Michael Dell is determined to change the common perception of his companythat its a traditional maker of low-margin products like personal computers, servers and storage systems.
				   
				The view changed little even after Dell said in October 2015 that it will buy EMC Corp. Now that the merger of the two companies is complete, Dells strategy to alter this view is revolving around quickly rolling out new infrastructure products that have been jointly developed by Dell and EMC teams, cross-selling them to clients of both, strengthening existing partnerships with firms like SAP AG, Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp., and forging new ones even with competitors like Amazon Web Services Inc.Dell executives say they are best suited to help clients go digital with the combined entitys broad technology portfolio, which not only comprises computing products but also services and solutions in the areas of hybrid cloud, software-defined data centres and converged- and hyper-converged infrastructure (integration managed by software), platform-as-a-service, data analytics, mobility and cybersecurity.This multipronged strategy was evident when Dell took the stage at the first-ever Dell-EMC World 2016 event in Austin, Texas, on 18 October, and gave an impassioned speech that had all the trappings of a successful road map for next-gen computing.Beginning with a reiteration of the Go Big or Go Home, Baby! slogan delivered at last years Dell event, he peppered this years speech with technology buzzwords like digital, the Internet of things (IoT), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI).Alluding to Dells Digital Transformation Index , Dell underscored the presence of a digital fear among the 4,000 business leaders across 16 countries and 12 industries that were surveyed as part of a recent report. His pitch: This (digital) future is coming very rapidly and the future does not care whether you are ready. But we do... (We are) the trusted provider of essential infrastructure for the next industrial revolution.Dell evidently believes in economies of scale, made evident by his Go Big slogan. The Dell-EMC merger, announced last October, was the largest deal in tech history, topping Avago Technologies Ltds $37 billion purchase of Broadcom Corp.Dell Technologies is now a $74 billion company that comprises a PC business and affiliated businesses including virtualization (the partitioning of a physical server into smaller virtual servers in a bid to reduce costs) company VMware Inc., security firms RSA Security Llc and SecureWorks Inc., software and services (including cloud and Big Data analytics) company Pivotal Software Inc., and cloud management software firm Virtustream Inc. Dells eponymous combined business now comprises two segmentsDell EMC is the sub-brand for the companys enterprise business, including products and solutions, and Dell is the sub-brand for the companys client solutions for consumers, business and institutional customers.Dell plans to go about the task of ramping up business growth also by touting that the combined company stands as a market leader in many of the most important and high-growth areas of the information technology (IT) market, including positions as the Leader in 20 Gartner Magic Quadrants and a portfolio of more than 20,000 patents and applications.Does the pecking order bear out Dells claim?To be sure, the worldwide IT spending figure augurs well for technology companies like Dell Technologies, which figures in the top three in PCs, servers and storage.Overall IT spending is forecast to reach $3.5 trillion in 2017, up 2.9% from estimated spending of $3.4 trillion this year, according to Gartner Inc. According to the research firm, software and IT services segments have been the bright spots. Software spending is projected to grow 6% in 2016 and another 7.2% in 2017 to total $357 billion, while IT services spending is forecast to grow 3.9% in 2016 to $900 billion and 4.8% in 2017 to $943 billion.ALSO READ | Dell Technologiess road map for IndiaThe total worldwide enterprise storage systems factory revenue remained flat year-on-year at $8.8 billion during the second quarter of 2016, according to research firm International Data Corporations (IDCs) Worldwide Quarterly Enterprise Storage Systems Tracker. EMC and HPE (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) accounted for 18.1% and 17.6% of spending, respectively, of the enterprise storage market (IDC declares a statistical tie when there is less than 1% difference in the revenue share of two or more vendors.). Dell held the next position with 11.5% share of revenue during the quarter. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and NetApp Inc. accounted for 6.8% and 6.7% of global spending, respectively.Sales of server-based storage were up 9.8% during the quarter and accounted for almost $2.4 billion in revenue. External storage systems remained the largest market segment, but the $5.7 billion in sales represented flat year-on-year growth. However, according to Liz Conner, research manager of storage systems at IDC, spending on all flash-based storage deployments continues to grow and help drive the market, following the decreasing cost of flash media, deployments and availability of flash-based storage products (a sharp focus area for the combined entity, Dell Technologies).ALSO READ |In firms, PCs and smartphones coexist in a multi-device world: Michael DellIn the same period, worldwide server revenue declined 0.8% year-on-year, while shipments grew 2% from the second quarter of 2015, according to Gartner. Dell moved into the top spot in shipments, while HPE remained the worldwide leader in server revenue.Dell garnered 19.3% of the market and moved into the No. 1 position in worldwide server shipments due primarily to growth resulting from programmes it has in place in the Asia-Pacific region, most notably in China. HPE continued to lead the x86 server (Intel-based server) market in revenue with 26% of the market. IBM secured the third position with 9.1% of the market, but experienced the largest decline among the top five vendors, according to the Gartner report.Contrarian betsNotwithstanding the scepticism over the merger, there is certainly some merit in Dells claim over the economies of scale that this merger can achieve even as there remain formidable challenges that continue to keep some analysts and clients sceptical. The challenges include concerns over the sum paid for the acquisition, integration challenges, some overlap in products and technologies between Dell and EMC, leadership issues in the combined entity, and partnership conflicts since some Dell partners compete with EMC and VMware.Michael has an opportunity to redefine computing if he reinvests on innovation and can pare back the debt, said R Ray Wang, principal analyst, founder and chairman of Silicon Valley-based Constellation Research Inc. He, however, pointed out that customers and partners remain sceptical, wondering if this is an exercise to sell off the parts of the acquisition to pay down debt and save Dell, or a strategic play to own the cloud and the future of the data centre.Shedding the enterprise software assets leads us to believe that this may not be an innovation play yet but a move to sell off assets to save Dell. The experience at HP Enterprise is what customers are scared of. They dont want to see their favourite vendors exit the market where massive investments have been made. The challenge is having two legacy players come together for innovation. The math in the accounting makes it hard to believe what innovations will come about. Dell did attempt to address this road map at Dell World but most of our clients remain sceptical, said Wang.Dell is also a contrarian when it comes to defying certain technology trends. For instance, Dell became a private company on 5 February 2013, in a deal led by Silver Lake that was valued at $24.9 billionthe biggest leveraged buyout since the financial crisiseven as other tech firms seek stock market listings. Second, he believes in mergers and acquisitions even as competing companies like Hewlett Packard have split their businesses. Third, while the world is betting on smartphones, his company no longer makes them.I dont think the world needs another smartphone company, says Dell. A smartphone is just another node, explains Dell, adding that all the information you get on a smartphone comes from a data centre. And what you upload, goes back to the data centre.This, for Dell, is a business opportunity since his company provides servers that are used by data centres.Wang agrees that the smartphone market is a bad one to be in and is not worth it when you dont own the OS (operating system).However, the fact is that even as Dell remains optimistic over the future of the PC (desktops and laptops), worldwide PC shipments totalled 68.9 million units in the third quarter of 2016, a 5.7% decline from the third quarter of 2015, according to the preliminary findings of Gartner. This was the eighth consecutive quarter of decline in PC shipmentsthe longest streak in the history of the PC industry.Lenovo Corp. continued to be the worldwide market leader based on preliminary PC shipments, but HP Inc. is nearly tied for this top spot. Segment-wise, Dell claims his company is No. 1 in PCs in terms of revenue but Dell ranked third in terms of shipments with a share of 13.5% in the third quarter of 2016. (All these rankings could change when final shipment results are published by Gartner.) Dell is insistent that revenue is more important than shipments.Banking on innovationWe have been growing (the PC business) for 15 quarters. We want to be profitable so that we can reinvest in innovation, he says. Part of his companys innovation is around the PC computing system, as Jeff Clarke, vice- chairman of operations and president of client solutions, puts it. There is much innovation in the PC computing system... like the computer becoming personal and new experiences with AR/VR that provide users with new ways to interact, explains Clarke. In a 7 September blog, Clarke also points out that beyond the device, workforce transformation requires a cloud-based infrastructure to support peoples new behaviors, new devices and new expectations, which EMC can provide. He also underscored the importance of Airwatch (now a Dell company) as an EMM (enterprise mobility management) solution for managing phones and tablets.And with cloud client-computing VDI (virtual desktop infrastructure solutions) from VMWare, we are the only true end-to-end VDI provider in the industry, from planning to deployment, data center to the endpoint, on- and off-premise. Bottom line: Combining EMCs cloud capabilities with our award-winning PCs, we have just created a very powerful solution, wrote Clarke.For instance, the Dell-EMC product collaboration has resulted in products like VxRaila hyper-converged infrastructure solution from VMware that includes fifth generation Intel Xeon processors and Dells PowerEdge servers. As opposed to a converged infrastructure model (also known as hardware-defined) where the server, networking and storage can be separated if needed, in a hyper-converged infrastructure (referred to as software-defined) the components are integrated and hence cannot be split.The other part of innovation revolves around Dells belief that IoT is fundamentally changing businesses. Explaining his rationale for why we created Dell Technologies, Dell says the planet is becoming more intelligent and more connected by the minute, and ultimately will become intertwined with a vast Internet of Things, paving the way for our customers to do incredible things.Dell elaborated in his speech that as the cost of making something intelligent approaches zero dollars, intelligence is being embedded into every aspect of our physical world. We have about 8 billion connected devices on the planet, and 15 years from now there will be 200 billion or more, and all these sensors and nodes in those devices will provide access to a host of new digital applications, creating massive new sources of information. Using this information to provide better insights and build a better world may be the biggest opportunity in history, he said.Using the premise that everything improves about 10x every five years, Dell in his speech also envisioned a future with smart cities, driverless cars and nanobots that cure cancer and repair cell damage. He added that overnight shipping will seem like snail mail compared to the instant gratification of drone delivery... AR and VR will redefine work, learning and play... machine learning, deep learning, AI and unsupervised learning to all this data will unleash a torrent of innovation and progress and solve some of the worlds greatest challenges.Towards this end, Dell and EMC have made a cumulative research and development (R&D) investment of $12.7 billion over the past three years and plan to invest $4.5 billion in R&D this year, which is multiple times what the competition is investing, Dell said.Dell, for instance, has invested in six worldwide global command centres where technicians constantly monitor events like flight delays, traffic jams, weather conditions, earthquakes or even unsettling events like riots that might impact the companys ability to handle a support call. The technicians track live tweets, live broadcasts of news and weather, and map the location using geographical information systems and Google Earthall in a single window using a customized interface. India (Bengaluru) does not have a global command centre but has a social media listening command centre.In June, Dells Extreme Scale Infrastructure group unveiled Tritona liquid cooling technology that scores over traditional air-cooled solutions for data centres. It designed this water-based system to cool server chips (developed with Intel Corp.) in eBay.coms data centres.In an 18 October note, Mike Krell, lead IoT analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, agreed that Dell Technologies was uniquely positioned to help customers solve their IoT puzzle. Dell, Krell wrote, combines experience and credibility with specific vertical market enterprises, a curated partner ecosystem with deep vertical knowledge, the industrys broadest offering of IoT-focused infrastructure, and an ability to provide a world-class customer experience to help customers solve specific IoT problemstoday.But will Go Big work for Dell?Dells growth strategy also revolves around acquisitions, which Dell says will continue. Ever since Michael Dell returned to the company as its chief executive in 2007, the company has spent as much as $15 billion on more than 30 acquisitions prior to the $67 billion EMC purchase. These included EqualLogic ($1.4 billion; storage area networks, where EMC dominates), Perot Systems ($3.9 billion; IT services), SecureWorks ($612 million; security services, where EMCs RSA division has a big presence), Force10 ($700 million; data centre Ethernet switches) and Quest Software ($2.4 billion; system management and security software), among others.However, not all of those acquisitions have done well for Dell, including some with a significant presence in the Indian market (security provider SonicWALL, for instance). According to a 20 June report on TechCrunch, while Dell had reportedly paid $3.6 billion for Quest Software and SonicWALL, it was only able to recoup around $2 billion for the duo when it sold them to private equity firm Francisco Partners and hedge fund Elliott Management. Dell also had to sell Perot Systems to Japans NTT Data Corp.  for $3.1 billion in March.Nevertheless, analysts like Ashish Nadkarni, program director for IDCs worldwide infrastructure practice, believe that having a bigger, more full-service portfolio allows the combined company (Dell Technologies) to address a wide range of use cases in a very holistic fashion. In a 16 April note, he pointed out that these solutions could be diverse and even emerging, like IoT and real-time analytics. Dell and EMC can likewise take advantage of synergies when it comes to joint go-to-market efforts around compute, storage, and networking solutions,  wrote Nadkarni.He also believes that since Dell Technologies is a privately-held company, it will be able to offer the flexibility of interesting product road maps and solutions as well as additional purchasing options, like subscription-based offerings, free from the 90-day shot clock pressures typically exerted on public companies.On his part, Dell is clear that his company needs to savour customer relationships. He concludes: There are many customers who do not want to change, and we dont want to change them. There are plenty of opportunities for cross-selling. When we looked at the top 5,000 Dell customers and the top 5,000 EMC customers, we found only 1,000 common ones. So there are enormous opportunities to cross-sell among the portfolio. Customers are excited about that toothey actually like the fact that we are bringing everything together with these engineered and integrated solutions. Thats what we are focused on.",2016-11-15,qV03Hr8aiVWnLwqzhDJqpM,Dell is leveraging its EMC acquisition to offer services and solutions for companies to cope with the fast-transforming digital landscape,competitor,04:42,Will Dell make it big with EMC?
0.63,"Wipro Ltd, for now, is lagging behind Infosys Ltd in growth. Still, when it comes to mergers and acquisitions (M&As) and investments in start-ups made by the two rivals over the last two years, Infosys Ltds boss Vishal Sikka may want to look at Wipros playbook, overseen by chief strategy officer Rishad Premji. 
				   
				Rishad Premji is the son of Wipro chairman Azim Premji, and reports to Wipro chief executive officer Abidali Neemuchwala.Over the last year, Infosys, surprisingly, has shied away from buyouts, despite spending $390 million to purchase three firms in the first year of Sikkas tenure (see chart). Infosys is grappling with finding a stable management team to steer its M&A division. In July this year, Sikka asked Deepak Padaki to head the M&A team, just 18 months after Infosys reposed faith in Sikkas former SAP colleague, Ritika Suri, to oversee the M&A division.Finally, the pace of investments in start-ups made by Infosys has slowed; the firm has made only two investments since January. Infosys has spent some $33 million (out of its $500 million fund to invest in start-ups) to buy stakes in eight start-ups and an undisclosed amount in Vertex Ventures, a Palo Alto-based venture capital firm. Seven of these investments were made in 2015.M&A is an important theme for Infosys as the management expects $1.5 billion in new revenue from buyouts as part of Sikkas ambitious target of hitting $20 billion in revenue by March 2021. The three buyouts made by Infosys, for now, are estimated to bring less than $90 million in revenue.Wipros strategy is the most aggressive among home-grown IT firms, and can become a template for both Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys, its bigger rivals, in how to better deploy cash and also invest in areas which can make outsourcing companies future-ready.Wipro, in the last 18 months (since April last year, when Neemuchwala joined the company as chief operating officer), has spent over $1.13 billion in making four buyouts which, in addition to making the firm future-ready, together bring in over $550 million in revenue. TCS boss N. Chandrasekaran has not made a single buyout or an investment in start-ups in the last two years. Wipro has done a better job of M&A than most IT services firms to date, said Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm. They (Wipro) have been more deliberate whereas Accenture has been very aggressive, although the net results are the same. Wipro has got new service mixes and capabilities along with new clients. One aspect is the emphasis of taking company cultural considerations into play.Wang said that it appears that Infosys has slowed down M&As and venture activities. Infosys maintains that it continues to evaluate firms and start-ups and there is no slowdown in decision-making. Im very focused that every business unit should not have more than one acquisition to integrate and digest, Neemuchwala told Mint last week, explaining that M&As will bring in a significant share of revenue in Wipros ambition of becoming a $15 billion firm by 2020.Wipro has spent over $22 million (of a $100 million fund) in picking minority stakes in seven start-ups and a venture fund.Sikkas and Rishad Premjis style of running their M&A and venture arms is also different, as none of Infosyss executives, including Suri (who oversees Infosys Innovation Fund), have any experience in the venture capital space. In contrast, Wipros venture arm is run by Venu Pemmaraju, a former senior investment manager at Intel Capital, and company executive Biplab Adhya, who both report to Rishad Premji.One of the biggest benefits Wipro has accrued from its buyouts is that it has managed to retain the tag of Indias third largest software services firm, leaving HCL Technologies Ltd to be content at the fourth position.Wipro does not spell out the growth brought in from its four buyouts and the organic growth, but a senior executive conceded that the growth in core IT services has considerably slowed down. If Wipro manages to grow at the upper end of its 2% growth forecast in the fourth quarter, it will add $445.3 million in incremental revenue in calendar year 2016. The four buyouts are estimated to have accounted for at least $350 million in new business, translating to about 78% of all new business.HCL Technologies, which reported $6.23 billion in yearly revenue at the end of March 2016, will end with $7.04 billion in revenue at the end of March next year if it manages to grow at the managements at-best 13% annual guidance. Wipro, which does not give annual growth guidance, is expected by analysts to report at-best 5.5% growth, translating to the company recording $7.75 billion in revenue at the end of the current financial year.",2016-10-29,qeaQ9hDqenc00ogIsHBKlM,"Wipros M&A strategy, overseen by Rishad Premji, is the most aggressive among home-grown IT firms, and can become a template for TCS and Sikkas Infosys",company,00:03,Has Wipros Rishad Premji triumphed over Infosyss Vishal Sikka? 
-0.25,"If you are looking to embark on the human resources (HR) analytics journey, look no further than the good old recruitment process.
				   
				Once the process starts, recruiters use the recruitment brief and their judgement to shortlist candidates for interviews. Firms typically have huge amounts of historical data on employees who have performed well and those who have not. This clustering of employees can serve as a benchmark in selecting new ones. Top employees outperform average employees by up to eight times, so historical data has great potential.The interview process has various stages and there are dropouts in every stage. The questions to be asked are: what stage sees the most dropouts and why? Is it due to of low compensation figures, or is the process is taking too long? If low compensation is the reason, what is the delta that will lead to better salary elasticity?Among those that are hired many drop out in the first six months. The questions here are: what made them quit, and how can the firm identify the kind who are likely to leave soon?These questions indicate how data-led approaches can help transform the recruitment process. There are opportunities that lead either to process improvementsthe domain of efficiencyor to better HR decisionsthe domain of effectiveness. An analysis by McKinsey and Co. found recruitment efficiency can be improved up to 80%.Enterprises can tap the mountains of data they capture to foster new ways of decision making. For instance, the increasing availability of employee data in core IT applications is stimulating a fact-based approach to improve HR decisions.While the nature of applications of data varies according to enterprises, HR data is mainly being used to describe the state of HR metrics through simple statistical analysis; to construct statistical and machine learning models that lead to predictions and extract drivers that explain the phenomenon being modelled; and to deploy strategies to gauge the efficacy of the extant HR practice at enterprises.Drivers of HR analyticsBefore getting into the nuts and bolts of HR analytics solutions, we should perhaps acknowledge that data and human behaviour could work at cross purposesjust like oil and water. Besides, motivations that drive behaviour are intangiblethey cant be easily quantified.That said, one can get surprisingly better insights should one have access to longitudinal data. Having longer, time-series data, as it turns out, allows us to have a better stab at the problem. Since the data generation process continues as long as an employee remains in active engagement, access to data per se is not an issue. Moreover, statistical models are adept at identifying changes in employee behaviour over time.While there are certain HR problems that currently do not have a satisfactory solution within the existing management practices, HR departments can address many of the problems with data-led solutions.Profiling and segmentationSegmentation can be performed to isolate groups of employees with similar metrics. Identifying cohorts of similar employees reflects common performance drivers, characteristics and priorities. Each of these clusters can be explored with heat-maps and business metrics to derive the underlying narrative of the corresponding segments. The lessons derived from segmentation can be applied to effectively hire new employees and answer questions as to how long is an employee, on average, likely to stay.Performance predictionPerformance targets, especially for large enterprises and publicly-held companies, are so tightly intertwined with the broader stakeholder expectations that any misalignment or fall-back in performance can have considerable material implication. Prediction of the performance of front-line sales people is necessary for forecasting business throughput. Managers can use predictions in creative ways. For example, if the gap between performance and targets is expected to be large, other instruments such as advertisement and promotion or sales incentives can be introduced.AttritionEmployee churn is a fairly costly proposition for employers. Losing well-performing employees, acclimatised to the cultural moorings of the enterprise, is a concern. Also, higher employee churn invariably leads to escalation in costs in the form of new hiring, raising compensation levels, increased transactions and loss in productivity.Predictive models can assist not only in identifying those who are likely to quit but also when they might. Employees who score high on the performance index and high on churn probabilities are the obvious candidates for attrition intervention programmes. With statistical techniques such as Design of Experiments, the intervention programmes can be optimised to deliver lower employee churn. Offer rejectionGiven that filling a new position or a replacement invariably takes time, coupled with the waiting period between the offer acceptance and joining date, a dropout is bound to cost both time and money. This has a cascading impact especially in delivery-oriented or revenue-generating roles, and offer rejections can at times set back business plans. Predictive solutions can identify specific individual-level likelihood of a dropout, thus allowing the HR team to follow up with suitable actionsresulting in superior conversion rates.As technology and analytics occupy centre stage in business set-ups, firms slow in adopting technology and building analytics capabilities, risk lagging behind in the market place. The best firms see their employees not only as individuals but also as a rich source of collective data that can be used to make better talent decisions.Alok Shende is founder and director of Ascentius Insights.

0.91,"Mumbai: Private sector lender DCB Bank Ltd on Saturday reported a 25% surge in December quarter net profit at Rs51 crore, driven primarily by a growth in the core interest income. 
				   
				The lender had reported a post-tax profit of Rs41 crore in the year-ago period. Its net interest income rose 31% to Rs209 crore, while the non-interest income was up Rs36 crore to Rs64 crore during the quarter. The share of low-cost current and savings account balances increased to 25.85% as on 31 December, from the 21.91% three months ago, on the back of a surge in deposits following the governments demonetisation move. The surge in deposits, coupled with a massive slowdown in advances (which grew only 2% sequentially) led to a drop in the credit-deposit ratio to 77.41% from 83.33% in the year-ago period. The banks net interest margin was down 3.95% as against 3.96% in the year-ago period, primarily due to pressure on yield on advances, managing director and chief executive Murali Natrajan said. He added the bank is confident of sustaining the number but may not bother much if it dips to up to 3.70%.A sale to an Asset Reconstruction Company(ARC) helped improve the gross non-performing assets ratio to 1.55% from the 1.98% in the year-ago period.

0.37,"Mumbai: The Indian government on Friday slapped a $1.55 billion fine on Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and its partners BP Plc. and Niko Resources Ltd, for extracting gas from state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltds (ONGCs) deepwater block in the Krishna-Godavari basin for seven years.
				   
				Press Trust of India (PTI) and Reuters reported that a government notice seeking the penalty also gave the firms 30 days to respond. The Contractor (RIL, BP and Niko) has worked within the boundaries of the block awarded to it and has complied with all applicable regulations and provisions of the Production Sharing Contract (PSC). The claim of the Government is based on misreading and misinterpretation of key elements of the PSC and is without precedent in the oil & gas industry, anywhere in the world, an RIL spokesperson said in an emailed statement.The liability of the Contractor has not been established by any process known to law and the quantification of the purported claim is without any basis and arbitrary. RIL proposes to invoke the dispute resolution mechanism in the PSC and issue a Notice of Arbitration to the Government. BP, too, confirmed receiving the letter and said the resolution of such geological boundary disputes should be based on well-established international petroleum industry practices and in line with the PSC.RIL shares fell 1.92% on Friday to close at Rs1,005.80 on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex index dropped 0.57% to close at 27,274.15 points.It  (will be) a long court battle. The market (has) already discounted this penalty. Hence, we do not see any impact in the near future, said Rajnath Yadav, a research analyst at Choice Broking.Justice A.P. Shah, who was appointed by the government to look into the matter, said in his report presented on 31 August that the government should quantify the unfair enrichment gained by RIL and its partners. Whatever benefits the companies may have derived was liable to be returned to the government, the report said. The committee did not recommend any compensation to ONGC, which it said had no ownership rights over the natural resource.The Government of India, and not ONGC, is entitled to claim restitution from RIL for the unjust benefit it received and unfairly retained. ONGC has no locus standi to bring a tortuous claim against RIL for trespass/conversion since it does not have any ownership rights or possessory interest in the natural gas a PTI report cited the A.P. Shah committee report as saying.ONGC claims that between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2015, about 11 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas flowed to KG D6 field from adjacent fields, of which 8.9 bcm was appropriated by RIL, said the panel, citing a report by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, a US-based consultancy hired jointly by ONGC and RIL which had earlier confirmed flow of gas from ONGCs field to RILs. At the prices prevailing at that time, the gas was worth Rs11,000 crore.ONGCs two blocks are adjacent to the RIL-operated block.

-0.55,"Kolkata: Unfazed by its earlier failed attempts to expand overseas, state-owned miner Coal India Ltd (CIL) will again scout for reserves of coking coal and high-grade low ash thermal coal in countries such as the US, Colombia, Canada, Australia, Indonesia and South Africa.
				   
				Mozambique, where last year it had to surrender a block taken for exploration because of its unfavourable geology, is not among the target countries this time, according to bid documents released by CIL.The public sector behemoth appears to be a little behind in seizing the opportunity to secure assets when coal prices were low, experts said. But the CIL management is of the view that asset prices may have still not bottomed out.Several coal producers in the US, including Peabody Energy Corp.the worlds largest private sector coal minerwere until recently wallowing in losses and had filed for bankruptcy last year in the wake of falling coal prices.But coal prices have started to firm up again, and many of them might emerge from the crisis within months with the help of fresh bank funding.Inviting bids from investment bankers, CIL said it will not be able to meet the demand for coking coal and high-grade low ash thermal coal from its own mines in India, despite efforts to ramp up production.Reserves of recoverable coking coal, which is used in production of steel, is limited in India, and high-grade low ash thermal coal is almost unavailable in India, CIL said in its bid document.This isnt the first time CIL is scouting for assets abroad.Under the leadership of Partha S. Bhattacharyya, who retired as CIL chairman in February 2011, the company had almost concluded a deal to acquire a 10% stake in Peabody Energy, which would have given it access to a large volume of coking coal mined in Australia at a concessional price. But the deal didnt materialise because there were no clear guidelines on overseas acquisitions, Bhattacharyya had then said.Overseas acquisitions are fraught with risks, and no executive at the state-run enterprise would take responsibility for a failed investment, said a key official at CIL, who didnt wish to be named. It had serious implications, even after retirement.Though the government tried to make things easier by issuing some guidelines towards the end of 2011, CIL started to explore other ways of importing coal such as through long term supply contracts with international producers. This plan, too, didnt materialise.This time, CIL is looking to partner overseas miners to start new mines or take equity interest in operating mines which will give it the right to import a certain share of the outputan arrangement which is known as production sharing or participation interest in mining parlance.Previous attempts to acquire assets abroad failed because asset prices were too high for CILs liking, the spokesperson for the miner said, adding that miners were at that time driving a hard bargain because they had too many suitors.Globally asset prices could soften further, according to this person, and CIL has entered the market at the right time. Theres been a bump in coal prices recently, but this would ease out in 3-4 months, he added.Scouting for coking coal assets abroad makes sense, said an industry expert who didnt want to be named. But it is late in the day to look for thermal coal. In India, demand for thermal coalor the variant used in power generationis not growing at a pace previously anticipated.

-0.24,"About 58% of all households in India (145 million out of 247 million) had access to banking services, according to the 2011 Census.
				   
				This number varied widelyfrom nearly 90% of households in Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Himachal Pradesh to less than 40% in Meghalaya, Nagaland and Manipur. There was also a significant rural-urban divide, with more than two-thirds of urban households having access to banking services while only 54% of rural households did.A few months after coming to power in 2014, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government launched the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), which sought to open low-cost savings accounts for the hitherto unbanked.While the number of accounts opened under this scheme (254 million, see http://bit.ly/1S6TFw3 ) is larger than the total number of households in India, according to the 2011 Census, it is not clear how many unique households the PMJDY customers belong to, and how many of those already had access to banking services.In other words, until the 2021 census, it is unlikely well find out the proportion of households with access to banking services (though the PMJDY website claims nearly 100% of households have been covered by the scheme).Access to banking matters more now in light of the recent withdrawal of Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes from legal tender. As Id written in these pages several months ago, these notes made up for about 85% (by value) of all currency in circulation in 2015-16.While Id commented then that the fiscal impact of the move will amount to about Rs12,000 crore a year (http://bit.ly/1R1W4a0), the number is going to be far lower, thanks to the new Rs500 and Rs2,000 notes that are being introduced. The extent to which the new notes will replace the old is not yet known; so, it is not possible right now to estimate the fiscal impact of the move. Removing 85% of all currency by value from circulation has had an impact on ordinary people, though, with the sudden drop in liquidity causing friction in even basic transactions that are otherwise straightforward. While small-value transactions might yet be conducted using smaller notes that are still legal tender, access to the banking system has become a necessary condition for larger transactions. More specifically, since cheques can be used while transacting only with trusted parties (thanks to the risk of a cheque bounce), access to debit cards determines the ability to transact in large amounts (until the new currency has sufficiently replaced the old).In September 2016 (the last month for which data is available), there were 728 million debit cards outstanding in India. This doesnt imply many people have debit cards, though, since many people have multiple bank accounts and debit cards. In September, each of these 728 million cards was used (on an average) once to make an ATM withdrawal, with an average withdrawal of Rs3,000. The number of times the average debit card is being used for ATM withdrawals has been falling steadily over the years, though (see chart 1).While the decline in the use of debit cards at ATMs seems steady over time, one period shows a prominent (discontinuous) declinelate 2014-early 2015. This period coincided with the launch of PMJDY, where three-fourths of new account holders (195 million out of 255 million) were also given Rupay debit cards (as chart 2 shows, there was a discontinuous jump in the number of debit cards outstanding in this period).What the two graphs together suggest is that while the Jan Dhan Yojana opened new bank accounts and gave debit cards, a large number didnt bother using these accounts or debit cards.This is worrying from the point of view of the recent withdrawal of high-value notes since it suggests that the access to banking services based on the number of accounts or cards is actually an overestimate (in terms of actual usage).While some of these never used accounts (according to the PMJDY website, about 23% of all PMJDY accounts have never seen action, and have zero balances), they  might start seeing balances soon as people deposit their high-value currencies into the accounts.The use of formal banking can be a logistical and cultural challenge, and it is not clear if those who have so far not used bank accounts will be able to do so immediately. A lot of people are not going to have it easy for the next few weeks until the withdrawn currency has been adequately replaced in the system.",2016-11-14,qrSQCsXhEPEnXEcZ1z13jP,"Until the 2021 census, it is unlikely well find out the proportion of households with access to banking services ",competitor,00:50,Access to banking services an overestimate?

-0.02,"San Francisco: Google just debuted a digital assistant, which it hopes to place inside smartphones, watches, cars and every other imaginable internet-connected device. Its already hit a snag.
				   
				The Alphabet Inc. division launched new smartphones last week with the artificially intelligent assistant deeply embedded. It also rolled out a speaker with the feature at its core and announced plans to let other companies tie their apps and services to the assistant.A day later, Samsung Electronics Co., one of the largest manufacturers of smartphones and other consumer devices, said it was acquiring Viv Labs, a startup building its own AI voice-based assistant. At first, the deal looked like a counter-punch to Samsung rival Apple Inc.  Viv is run by the creators of Apples Siri assistant. But buying Viv may be more of a problem for Google, because Samsung is the biggest maker of phones running Googles Android mobile operating system.Google strategy is now centered on the assistant, rather than its search engine, because its a more natural way for people to interact with smartphones and other connected devices. Getting all Android phone makers to put the Google assistant on their devices would get the technology into millions of hands quickly. But Samsungs Viv deal suggests assistants are too important for phone makers to let other companies supply this feature.Last week, Samsung executive Injong Rhee said the company plans to put Vivs technology in its smartphones next year and then embed it into other electronics and home appliances. A Samsung representative and a Google spokeswoman declined to comment.Thats a necessity for Samsung, according to some analysts and industry insiders.As AI is becoming more sophisticated and valuable to the consumer, theres no question it will be important for hardware companies, said Kirt McMaster, executive chairman of Cyanogen Inc., a startup that makes Android software. McMaster, a frequent Google critic, said other Android handset makers will likely follow Samsungs move. If you dont have an AI asset, youre not going to have a brain, he added.Google may already have known that some Android phone makers  known as original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs  were reluctant to embrace its assistant.Other OEMs may want to differentiate Googles Android chief Hiroshi Lockheimer told Bloomberg before it released its own smartphones. They may want to do their own thing  their own assistant, for example.Samsung and Google have sparred in the past over distribution. Google requires Android handset makers to pre-install 11 apps, yet Samsung often puts its own services on its phones. And the South Korean company has released devices that run on its own operating system, called Tizen, not Android.Keeping upViv was frequently on the short-list of startups that could help larger tech companies build assistant technology. Founded four-years ago by Dag Kittlaus, Adam Cheyer and Chris Brigham, the startup was working on voice technology to handle more complex queries than existing offerings. While it drummed up considerable attention and investment, Viv has not yet released its product to the public. And some analysts are skeptical of Samsungs ability to convert the technology into a credible service, given its mixed record with software applications.It will be very hard to compete with Googles strength in data and their AI acquisitions, said Jitendra Waral, senior analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. Samsung would need to prove that its AI solutions are superior to that of Googles. They are handicapped in this race.Samsung is also focused on handling the fallout from its exploding Galaxy Note 7 phones, potentially taking management time away from its Viv integration.But its a race Samsung has to join. In recent years, Samsung acquired mobile-payments and connected-device startups to keep up with Apple, Google and Amazon.com Inc. Digital voice-based assistants may be more important, if they become the main way people interact with devices.Silicon Valley titans are rushing into the space because of this potential. Amazon is trying to sign up developers for its Alexa voice technology. Apple has recently touted more Siri capabilities and opened the technology to other developers. And now Google, considered the leader in artificial intelligence, is making its own push.I dont ever remember a time when every single major consumer tech company  and even enterprise companies  have been singularly focused on an identical strategy, said Tim Tuttle, chief executive officer of MindMeld Inc., a startup working on voice interaction software. Theyre all following the exact same playbook. Bloomberg",2016-10-11,r3BDuvPlvO0Czy3noC8aiK,"Samsungs buying Viv Labs may be more of a problem for Google, because it is the biggest maker of phones running Googles Android operating system",competitor,17:39,Googles plan to spread its AI assistant hits Samsung roadblock

0.06,"Mumbai: Union Budget 2017s proposals on electoral funding reforms have found favour generally, but the plan to issue so-called electoral bonds is seen as yet another attempt by the government to step on the turf of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
				   
				While all details on electoral bonds are not out yet, heres what is known: a person wishing to donate to a political party can purchase these bonds from an authorized bank using cheques or digital payment methods. These bonds shall be redeemable only in the designated account of a registered political party. To issue these bonds, the government will amend the RBI Act. On the face of it, these bonds look like bearer bonds. These are instruments which are not registered in the name of a specific owner and will pay to whoever bears them.Section 31 of the RBI Act gives power, as of today, to issue bearer bonds to RBI and government. The bearer bond has the characteristic of a currency. That is why the power is not given to a bank, said a senior RBI official on condition of anonymity.The RBI Act states that other than the central bank and central government, nobody can issue notes which have the characteristic of a banknote or a currency note. Hence, the government move to amend the Act to allow commercial banks to issue such bonds is leading to some discomfort among RBI officials who feel it will erode some of the central banks authority.The issue is especially sensitive coming at a time when two former governorsY.V. Reddy and Bimal Jalanhave expressed concern over RBIs eroding autonomy after the government rode roughshod over the central bank while demonetizing high-value currency notes.This will unnecessarily fragment the note-issuing authoritys capacity. The government can do without amending the Act, said a senior banker on condition of anonymity.Such bonds have nothing to do with RBIs authority or autonomy, said an expert in financial markets, but added that they are a bad idea nonetheless. RBI is a creature of RBI Act and if the government amends the Act, RBI will have to comply. I dont see the governments move to issue electoral bonds as infringing on RBIs autonomy, said Ajay Shah, professor, National Institute for Public Finance and Policy.A bearer bond assumes the character of cash. Then there is no difference if political parties are funded by cash or through electoral bonds. It doesnt improve the transparency of the funding process, said Shah.This is not the first time that the government has issued bearer bonds. In 1987, the then government floated a development bond called Indira Vikas Patra, which was issued through post offices. Since this had the characteristic of a bearer bond, it conferred anonymity to the holders of this bond.

-0.66,"Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltds (RIL) third-quarter report card may not have had the stock market excited, but the energy company expects its gross refining margins (GRMs) to stay in double digits going forward. 
				   
				GRM is what a refiner  earns from turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel. RIL announced its third-quarter results on 16 January. During the quarter, RIL's GRMs stood at $10.8 per barrel, against $10.1  in the second quarter and $11.5  a year ago. Though it reported a $4.1 per barrel premium to Singapore complex margins, it was the lowest in the past three quarters. Singapore GRMs came in at $6.74 per barrel. This is our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit GRMs and double-digit GRMs are good, said Srikanth Venkatachari, Reliances joint chief financial officer, after the companys  earmings conference. Srikanth added that he sees the GRMs sustained at these levels going forward. As a refinery, we are seeing a demand growth for products. The underlying demand trends are good. When you look at the demand for refined products and the supply for the same, clearly, demand outstrips supply. Our own outlook is that we continue to think that the refining environment is in a good spot. (RIL) Management expects GRM to remain strong as net refining capacity addition of 5 million barrels of oil per day (mbpd) over the next five years will lag demand growth of 6 mbpd. In the medium term too, fuel demand growth of 1.3 mbpd in CY2017 shall surpass refining capacity addition, thereby keeping margins firm. Also, strong demand growth from Asia (especially India and China) and refinery closures in Europe will support GRM, said Axis Capital in its research report dated 17 January.Refining and marketing and petrochemicals form over 95% of RILs profit. RIL reported a 3.6% increase in its consolidated net profit at Rs7,506 crore for the three months ended 31 December from Rs7,245 crore a year earlier. Consolidated revenue came in at Rs 84,189 crore against Rs 72,513 crore a year earlier. Goldman Sachs in a report dated 17 January said it expects RILs refining margins to outperform peers. The company refined 17.8 million tonnes of crude oil during the quarter, lower than the 18 million tonnes  a year earlier, following a five-week shutdown at a catalytic cracking unit. The company operates two refineries in Gujarat, with a combined capacity of 1.24 million barrels a day. RILs two refineries in Jamnagar help it process cheaper crude, boosting its refining margins. RIL, which has invested heavily in expansion of its core projects, will see the expansion paying off from FY18. Analysts expect GRMs to be boosted by $0.7-$0.9 per barrel by the commissioning of the expansion of its core projects.  ""RILs grandiose $50 billion capex programme is nearing completion and will effectively double its gross block by FY18 estimated. About 35% of the overall capex was incurred towards core businessesrefining, petrochemicaloff as cracker ($5bn); petcoke gasification ($5bn); and US ethane imports ($1.5bn) are on track for commissioning from January 20117 to end CY17.These should further enhance GRMs and petrochemical margins,"" said Edelweiss Securities Ltd in its report dated 16 January.  Investment in petcoke gasification will help RIL meet its entire fuel requirement at the refineries and eliminate its petcoke production of 6.5 million tonnes a year, generated from two of its cokers. The technology for petcoke gasification will help RIL produce 23 mscmd (million standard cubic metres a day) of syngas and will aid in reducing R-LNG (regasified liquefied natural gas) intake for its refineries.  In the analyst meet, the company highlighted plans to raise the utilization rate for its downstream refining units, which along with term contracts on heavy crude, should help cushion the impact from potential reduction in crude discounts. The company highlighted its flexibility to move product yields by 10-15% which we believe should support GRMs as we see diesel margins outperforming gasoline in 2017,"" said Morgan Stanley in its report dated 17 January.",2017-01-24,rJaSLjQgZUrrwefo1NcxRO,GRM is what a refiner  earns from turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel ,both,10:28,RIL hopes its double-digit GRM will continue to hit the sweet spot 
-0.08,"Mumbai: Adding a fresh twist to the nearly two-month-old battle with Tata Sons Ltd, Cyrus P. Mistry on Monday announced his decision to not contest the forthcoming extraordinary general meetings (EGMs) and instead step down from the board of all the operating companies where he is a director.
ALSO READ | Cyrus Mistry cedes space to take moral high groundIn his first media interaction since the boardroom putsch that forced him to exit, Mistry said he is shifting gears and taking the fight with Tata Sons to a bigger platform, hinting, perhaps, at legal challenges to come. He said Tata Sonss coercive behaviour and uncertainty facing the shareholders had made him decide to quit. Edited excerpts:What prompted this decision to step down?I think the reason for the decision is wedded in the history of the Pallonji family, which has always supported the Tata group. What I have seen in the last eight weeks is a significant coercive behaviour from Tata Sons with employees and other stakeholders,  and as you see in their EGM notice, a threatening attitude, creating a situation of tremendous unease.My belief is that from here, the platform has to change to the legal side to ensure we protect the shareholders. The output is still the samewhat we are ensuring is governance reform and ensuring the ethical values of the founder... I will continue to pursue that very vigorously. What we have seen in the last eight weeks as far as the EGMs are concernedthe process has shown a lack of governance which I have detailed out. It has thrown up many ethical issues that have come to the fore. What we also saw in the last eight weeks is the huge amount of uncertainty, which I wanted to put to bed.What was the trigger for the move to step down?There was no trigger. One has to reflect from time to time. What we have achieved so far, is to initiate a dialogues for change and reform. What one would achieve by going ahead with the EGMs would be more destructive than productive.History shows that we have always looked at the best interest of the group. I believe the best interest of the group will be served by taking this to a new platform.What nextI cant discuss the legal strategy, but you will see it unfold.What would be the status of the EGM (of Indian Hotels) which was to take place tomorrow (Tuesday)?I think the EGM will be cancelled.What other steps will you take to ensure that all these governance reforms are carried out?We have brought the dialogue on the table, both from the point of view of governance and ethics, and I think that is today in peoples minds. I believe you will see shareholders in the near future demanding (better) governance.Have there been any instances that make you feel that some of this has already come to the fore?Yes, I think I will not go into the details of which one, but there have been instances of that.And I think also what is important was to first take me out of the equation because if I am in the equation, it gets clouded. I want to take myself out of the equation to make sure this is not a battle about me; this is effectively a battle for company governance reform. So by doing so, I have taken myself out of the position. I have been consistent if you see on the same thingin my EGM, in my representation.Again, I have reiterated this in my letter to the TCS (Tata Consultancy Services Ltd) shareholders. Many shareholders are ready to abstain to send a message to the company that this is not something that they wanted to do.Would Mr Wadias moves have had an impact?Mr Wadia has taken his own independent decision, and I think Mr Wadia might well continue with his position. His position is different from mine; his position is from an independent directors point of view, and, clearly, the fact that I am not contesting the EGM, strengthens his position because there is no question of him supporting me. I think he has always been for the institution of independent directors and thats the fight that he will continue I am sure.Whats the end game in terms of governance reforms that you want to achieve?I think from my perspective whats important is that the (Tata) Trusts themselves look at an appropriate governance structure, whether thats including succession planning, decision-making, and the interface with Tata Sons.ALSO READ | Tata Sons calls Cyrus Mistry resignation a deliberate strategyTata Sons itself at the board (level) has to reform and understand how it interacts with the Trusts and with the operating companies. And I think thats the part of the reform that needs to happen on the governance side. If you look at it on the ethics side, I think people who have been involved in any unethical actions have to vacate office. I think thats crucially important.Why did it take you so long to raise these issues?If you look at it, all of these issues,  whether they are governance reform and ethics, are exactly what I have been raising in Tata Sons. My role in Tata Sons is actually to raise those issues. My shareholders representation has raised the same issues. I have raised those issues again in the TCS letter, so I have been consistent. You will also see that in my statement and you will see that statement in the video (Editor's note: Mistry released a video on Monday explaining his position)  that effectively these were part of the board agenda the day that I was removed, and most probably a part of the reason I was removed as well.Did you these issues before the 24 October board meeting?The governance issues have been raised for a long time; the debate on performance of governance or structures of governance have been there for more than six months may be close to a year.You said in your letter that Ratan Tata said the reason (for removal) will go down with him to his grave...?I am waiting.

-0.4,"San Francisco: Juergen Schmidhuber taught a computer to park a car. Hes also showing that same machine how to trade stocks and detect flaws in steel production. Unrelated as these tasks may appear, Schmidhuber thinks a seemingly random training regimen is key to creating artificial intelligence that can solve any problem.
				   
				Schmidhubers AI theories tend to carry weight. In 1997, he co-authored a seminal paper that laid the groundwork for modern AI systems. It introduced a form of memory modelled after the human brain that helps computers make decisions based on context and prior experiences. The concept underpins most modern AI networks. Today he serves as the head of a Swiss AI institute thats proven to be a fertile breeding ground for many of the worlds top experts. The New York Times recently referred to him as a would-be father of AI.ALSO READ | Charting our artificial intelligence futureIn the last couple years, Schmidhuber has been toiling away in relative obscurity on a small venture called Nnaisense SA. As his ambitions grew, the company, whose name is pronounced nascence, raised its first round of venture capital this month. The funding shows that investors are willing to make a bet on Schmidhuber and his big ideathat just as with a child, the more skills Nnaisenses AI acquires, the easier it is to learn new ones.Schmidhuber, a consummate academic, said he decided to raise money partly to guard against the likes of Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Baidu Inc. The big companies came in and tried to hire my best people away, he said. One of the reasons that I had to become an entrepreneur, as well as an academic, was to try to defend that.Creating an all-purpose AI is a steep challenge for any company, let alone one with 15 employees. Nnaisense may not have the vast reams of search data on which Googles machines learn, but it can more nimbly jump from project to project, exposing its digital mind to many different experiences in the process. We always let it learn something new on top of the previous professions, Schmidhuber said. As you are learning new things, you want to make the task more complex.ALSO READ | Reverse-engineering artificial intelligenceSchmidhuber believes that by contracting out the services of his company to a variety of industries, the skills learned from each job will gradually snowball into a system capable of tackling any challenge it faces. Some within the AI community are skeptical of Schmidhubers bullishness. Companies such as International Business Machines Corp. and German start-up Arago GmbH have worked for years on applying AI to various unrelated projects without achieving consciousness. (But Watson has gotten pretty adept at chess and Jeopardy!)Nnaisenses new financier is Madrids Alma Mundi Ventures. Rajeev Singh-Molares, a partner at the firm, said hes optimistic about the startups chances going up against much larger companies. His firm invested $2 million to $5 million, though he declined to specify the exact sum. The big boys and girls have a lot of data, but they dont have this cross-industry datain insurance, banking, automotive, industrial processes and a couple of others, he said.ALSO READ | Securing a digital futureNnaisense recently worked with Volkswagen AGs Audi luxury auto unit to create a miniaturized car able to park itself. The system used cameras to teach itself how to drive on its own. Other autonomous driving rigs rely on many other sensors, including Lidar and radar, to find their way around based on predetermined parameters. Nnaisense applied similar techniques for its work with global steel giant ArcelorMittal and for the investing program, with hedge fund Acatis Investment GmbH.Commercial AI development within Alphabet, Apple, Facebook and elsewhere is typically determined by which endeavors are likely to be the most lucrative. Nnaisense said it chooses projects based on whether theyll benefit the machines knowledge, not which will bring in the highest fees. The company generated well under 10 million ($11 million) last year but expects to at least double its sales this year.Faustino Gomez, Nnaisenses chief executive officer (CEO) who started the company with Schmidhuber and three others, said theyre encouraged by early signs of the machines ability to transfer knowledge learned from one task to the next: What we ultimately want to do as we move forward is not to have to learn a solution for every problem from scratch. Bloomberg",2017-01-16,reHzFpVuiwBbYQ11zyeMrO,"Juergen Schmidhuber, often referred to as the father of  artificial intelligence, raised venture capital for his start-up looking to teach machines to solve any problem",competitor,20:25,AI pioneer Juergen Schmidhuber wants to build the renaissance machine of the future
0.62,"Mumbai: One of the biggest drivers of Indias superlative macro-economic performance in the recent past has been a relatively under-appreciated element: oil. Since 2014, the dramatic fall in crude oil prices has helped India contain her twin deficits, and tame inflation. But with oil exporting countries planning to curtail oil supply, raising the possibility of a rise in oil prices, the Indian economy might soon have to deal with another pain point besides demonetisation.
				   
				The extent of the gains from lower oil prices since mid-2014 is under-appreciated as the benefits have not been evident in the retail prices of petrol or diesel. However, the government did improve its finances, using the opportunity to increase the amount of taxes collected on petroleum products, as the charts below illustrate.The excise duty collected by the Union government on petrol and diesel has been hiked nine times since November 2014. The Union governments tax collection from petrol and diesel has increased from 0.4% of GDP in 2013-14 to 1.1% in 2015-16, i.e. an increase of 70 basis points (bps) in two years. To put this in perspective, this is more than the 60 bps reduction achieved in gross fiscal deficit (from 4.5% of GDP to 3.9% of GDP) over the same period. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.In other words, the entire reduction in Indias fiscal deficit could be attributed to the increase in Centres tax revenue from petrol and diesel alone. Hence, it is fair to say that falling crude oil prices have driven the improvements in Indias public finances over the past couple of years. Looking at more recent data for the first half of the fiscal year ending March 2017 (April-September 2016), and combining taxes with other oil-linked receipts such as dividends from public sector petroleum companies and states VAT collection on petroleum products, we find that the total receipts of the Centre and state governments from the petroleum sector have risen by about 50 bps since fiscal 2015 to 3.14%.Even the above-mentioned gains from the petroleum sector might be an underestimate because besides the increase in taxes, the Centre also gained from reduced subsidy burden owing to the fall in crude prices. Diesel prices were deregulated in 2014 and the diesel subsidy was eliminated in the last fiscal year (2015-16) itself. Previously, subsidy on diesel would cost 0.6% of GDP (FY14), jointly borne by the government and the public sector petroleum companies. Besides, subsidies on PDS kerosene and LPG have also reduced; however these reductions could also be attributed to government initiative to reform rather than a fall in petroleum prices per se. The upcoming Union Budget 2017 is likely to assume an average crude oil price of $55-$60 per barrel, as reported by the Hindustan Times. However, there remain risks that oil prices, which are already near $55 per barrel, could shoot up if the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and other oil exporters make good on their pledge to cut global oil supply by around 1.8%. Such a scenario, according to the International Energy Agency, would move the global oil market into deficit in the first half of 2017, i.e. demand would outstrip supply, after more than two years of comfortable surplus.In such a scenario, if oil rises above the governments comfort zone to say around $70 per barrel, then the government could lose tax revenues equivalent to about 0.4% of GDP which would jeopardize the governments plan to cut the fiscal deficit to 3% of GDP next year.To illustrate, in a hypothetical scenario where the global crude oil price is $70 per barrel in the coming fiscal year (2017-18) and the USD/INR exchange rate remains stable at 68, the government could either allow the petrol price (Delhi) to rise by another Rs10 to over Rs80 per litre, or reduce its excise tax duty from currently Rs21.48 per litre to Rs11.48 (if it wishes to keep prices same). If the government decides to reduce excise duties on petrol and diesel in similar fashion, then the Centres revenue from petrol and diesel could shrink to 0.7% of GDP in fiscal year 2018 compared to 1.1% in fiscal year 2016, back-of-the-envelope calculations show (assuming annual growth of 11.4% and 4.1% in demand for petrol and diesel respectively, as has been observed in the year so far). Thus, a spike in oil price to around $70 per barrel is enough to strain our public finances and add 0.4% to the Centres fiscal deficit. This would be over and above the increasing expenditure obligations on interest, salaries and pensions, compounded by Seventh Pay Commission recommendations and OROP. Read more If the government wishes to keep petrol and diesel prices unchanged, without sacrificing its tax revenues, then it would have to resort to subsidies (or under-recoveries) as used to be the case in yesteryears. Thus, no matter the recourse adopted, government finances will most likely be hit severely if oil prices rise, unless the government allows the prices of petroleum products to rise. Besides posing risks for the governments finances and stoking the fires of inflation, a rise in oil prices would also worsen the current account deficit. Assuming crude oil prices at $70/barrel and pencilling a constant pace of rise in volumes in oil imports and exports, as seen in the current fiscal year so far, and keeping all other things constant, Indias current account deficit could widen to 1.7% of GDP in fiscal 2018 compared to 1.1% of GDP in fiscal 2016.Indias net oil and gas import bill, i.e. adjusting for exports of petroleum products, amounts to around 2.5% of GDP, higher than Indias overall current account deficit and hence plays a big role in determining the dynamics related to the balance of payments. Thus, if there is one commodity to watch out for in 2017, it is likely to be oil.",2017-01-18,ro8NqXjBC4gk1i2OAQdGYN,The entire reduction in Indias fiscal deficit over the past few years can be attributed to the fall in crude oil prices,both,08:51,Why oil can spoil Indias budget math
-0.26,"Bajaj Auto Ltd expects to ride to glory on the back of domestic motorcycle sales this year. An ebullient management has given a sales guidance of 4.6 million units in fiscal year 2017. Of this, 3 million units are supposed to be domestic sales, which translate into a hefty 40% growth. That will compensate for an expected 10% drop in export volume.
				   
				Thats a gung-ho forecast from a firm which saw its volume decline 2% in April and is absent from the fastest-growing scooters segment. In fairness, the company has also hinted at a slew of product launches in the coming months.It also hopes to reap the full-year benefits of relatively fresh product introductions such as the Avenger in October and V in March. Bajaj Auto has also revived the economy segment in motorcycles with aggressively priced vehicles such as the CT100 and CT100-B in the past couple of years. Its entry into the cargo segment of commercial vehicles too should help boost volumes.The main worry for investors is whether this aggression in introducing new models and some of them lower priced ones at that, would erode margins. So far, that hasnt happened. In the March quarter, for instance, Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin came in at 21.3%, expanding 3.6 percentage points from a year ago.Bajaj Auto improved revenue per unit of sales and it was also able to reduce its materials costs-to-sales ratio. The latter might not be possible in the coming quarters as commodity prices start inching up. Another factor that would hit margins is the lower share of exports. With major export markets facing economic slump and currency weakening, it would be a surprise if exports perform ahead of the companys guidance, even though the management says that the worst is over. In April, exports had fallen 36%.That said, the management has guided for close to 20% Ebitda margin for the current fiscal year as well. An improving product mix with more sales from Avenger, Pulsar and V too should help.A strong volume and margin guidance, and the fact that Bajaj Autos realizations went up (an indication of pricing power) were the key reasons why investors cheered up the stock 3.96% after earnings were announced. Net profit at Rs.803 crore was in line with forecasts. While the stock trades at 17.6 times expected earnings per share for this year, after Wednesdays guidance, earnings estimates are likely to be revised upwards.",2016-05-26,rteoU7WQOP5ARbiuQGcBrJ,"The main worry for investors is whether the aggression in introducing new models, and some of them lower priced ones at that, would erode margins

0.17,"Singapore: Oil prices rose on Thursday, driven up by a weakening dollar, but gains were capped by plentiful supplies and inventories despite an effort by organisation of petroleum exporting countries (Opec) and other producers to cut output and prop up the market.
				   
				Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were trading at $55.56 per barrel at 1.31pm, up 48 cents, or 0.87%, from their last close.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $53.19 a barrel, up 43 cents, or 0.82%. Traders said that the gains were largely down to a weakening dollar, which has lost 3.9% in value since its January peak. Since oil is traded in dollar, a cheaper greenback makes fuel purchases less costly for countries using other currencies, potentially spurring demand.However, oil price gains were capped by data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) that showed an increase of 2.84 million barrels in commercial crude inventories to 488.3 million barrels, which add to a 6.3% rise in US oil production since the middle of last year to 8.96 million barrels per day (bpd).EIA estimates that crude oil and other liquids inventories grew by 2 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by an increase in production and a significant, but seasonal, drop in consumption, the agency said.Rising US inventories and output are countering efforts by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and other producers including Russia to cut supplies by a almost 1.8 million bpd during the first half of 2017 in an effort to end a global glut.Key customers in Asia are also being spared any significant cuts as producers fear losing market share to competitors.Crude supplies to Japan from its biggest supplier Saudi Arabia will not be impacted by last years agreement between Opec and non-Opec countries to cut output, Aabed Al-Saadoun, deputy minister for company affairs at Saudi Arabias Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources, said in Tokyo on Thursday.But Russia, which overtook Saudi Arabia as Chinas biggest supplier last year, is likely to remain Chinas top crude partner for some time as it prepares to expand its crude outflows via the Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline, energy consultancy BMI Research said in a report on Thursday. That comes as Saudi Arabia is set to cut supplies mainly of its medium-to-heavy grades to some customers in Asia, giving rival suppliers the opportunity to step in, the report added.

0.13,"San Francisco: Eduardo Frias, chief information officer at Beachbody LLC, recently traveled to San Francisco to hear a pitch from Oracle Corp.s top brass.
				   
				Beachbody was already a longtime user of Oracle business software for such tasks as finances and supply-chain management. Now chairman Larry Ellison wanted to sell Frias on a new product: direct access to remote data centers brimming with servers and networking tools -- a package of services that Santa Monica, California-based Beachbody now buys from cloud-computing leader Amazon.com Inc.Frias was intrigued. Oracle has made a lot of progress developing a product that could compete with Amazon, he said. Theyre doing incredibly, much better than in the past, he said of Oracles pitch at the Oracle OpenWorld conference in September. But Frias, whose company makes the P90X high-intensity home-fitness videos, has yet to take the plunge.Tens of thousands of businesses are loyal to Amazon Web Services, and it wont be easy for Oracle to erode Amazons lead in the market for public cloud computing. Thats not stopping Oracle chief executive officers Mark Hurd and Safra Catz from pouring billions of dollars into big bets on acquisitions, new hires and fresh products to advance Ellisons plan to target the industry. On Monday, they landed a cloud leader when Oracle completed its $9.3 billion acquisition of NetSuite Inc., which specializes in financial software. This latest gambit means less competition with older rivals such as SAP--and more with Amazon, Google and even Microsoft Corp.This is part of a bigger strategy, Hurd said in an interview. Were in the middle of a very significant transition in the IT industry.Brisk growthHurd can point to improving numbers. The growth rate for Oracles most closely watched cloud businesses -- including applications for finance, human resources and databases--jumped to 77% in the quarter ended 31 August, topping 66% in the previous period. These gains outpace those of key rivals, though its starting from a smaller base.But the transition is just beginning, and should have started earlier, some analysts said. Cloud revenue has yet to reach 15% of overall sales--not yet enough to prop up results. As traditional products slowed, total company sales missed estimates, climbing 1.7% in the quarter that ended in August. It was another reminder that the shift to the cloud has been uneven, and is not a fait accompli.Oracle waffled a little; now, theyre done waffling, said Dave Bartoletti, an analyst at Forrester Research. Theres no choice for Oracle but to do this. All of the money is going to cloud software and cloud infrastructure for the next 10 years.Wall Street has mixed opinions about Oracles plans, which could take years to prove out. Shares are up 7% so far this year, narrowly outpacing some of the major indices. Analysts have slightly more buy ratings on the stock than they did a year ago, while sells have fallen.The company has navigated identity changes in the past. It grew from a small database company founded in 1977 to become one of the largest tech companies in the world. It boasts a public market value among the top 50 in the US.Oracle is looking outside itself for help. In fiscal year that wrapped up in May, almost a third of the developer hires in the Oracle Public Cloud group came from competitors, according to a person familiar with the matter.NetSuite DealAcquisitions are also part of the cloud growth strategy. After a lull in large deals, Oracle secured its second-biggest takeover ever with NetSuite, though the deal wasnt without its critics. T. Rowe Price, one of NetSuites largest investors, said the the offer undervalued the target, and asked Oracle to pay $133 per share instead of the agreed-upon $109. NetSuites stock fell to less than $90 at one point in October when it looked like the deal was in jeopardy, yet Oracle insisted its price was final. In the end Oracle won approval with holders of 56% of eligible shares endorsing it.NetSuite provides cloud-based software that manages key functions in finance, part of whats called enterprise resource planning. While the companies have products in the same general areas, there is little direct customer crossover. Almost all of NetSuites customers have 700 or fewer employees, while nearly all of Oracles comparable clients have about 1,000 or more, according to another person with knowledge of the company.Oracle is also moving forward with home-grown tools, and in September unveiled a new plan for its own services for infrastructure, the core computing feature that lets developers easily build applications or work with databases. This business has been the laggard at Oracle, at less than a quarter of the size of the other cloud offerings and with slower growth.Hurd said the latest push -- backed by the companys own big data centers with more efficient servers -- is something new for the business that can help spur the next chapter of growth. Hes betting customers would rather have more products from fewer providers than a patchwork of tools from a smattering of companies. Oracle will let customers move existing applications to the cloud in areas such as human resources and customer relationship management, while providing developer tools and basic computing gear.This is all part of a thoughtful strategy that brings together a holistic cloud suite of services to address the broader market, he said.Amazons databaseThe bigger shift into cloud infrastructure follows Amazons decision to move more aggressively onto Oracles home turf in the database sector, according to Bartoletti. Online retailer Amazon has turned this strategy into a fine art on its traditional commerce side: attracting customers with one product, and then getting them to buy something else.Given Amazon Web Services size and features, its still a one-horse race in the broader market for infrastructure services, said Carl Brooks, an analyst at 451 Research. In the third quarter, Amazon had about 45% of the market for infrastructure as a service, where companies buy basic computing and storage power from the cloud, according to Synergy Research Group. Amazons revenue in this market is more than twice that of the next three players combined, Synergy said.Its helpful from an education standpoint for Oracle to say, Yes, we have AWS-style service capabilities, Brooks said in an e-mail. But theyre not in the same league yet.Ellison went out of his way to tout the new products during his OpenWorld keynotes in September. He didnt hold back underscoring Oracles plan to take on Amazon, mentioning his Seattle-based rivals name more than 60 times during one talk.Amazons lead is over, Ellison said.Amazon didnt exactly embrace Ellisons take. In an interview with Business Insider, AWS CEO Andy Jassy fired back at Ellison, calling the speech a classic old-guard technology tactic, in which a latecomer with less functionality and fewer customers tries to establish itself by manipulating benchmarks. And Amazon has done more to buttress its position, recently unveiling a deal with VMware Inc. to easily manage cloud services.Worth a LookYet Oracles new option is catching some attention. EHarmony has been a customer of Oracle products for about a decade, including the database -- and is using the software makers cloud-based Service feature, which helps clients better connect with their customers, according to Ninish Ukkan, the online dating services senior vice president of technology.We are exploring it -- its too early to say, he said. Because we have such a big footprint with Oracle, especially with our databases, its definitely worth a look.Boingo Wireless is another company that likes what it sees as the software provider ramps up sales efforts to better address the cloud. Boingo, which provides technology for wireless access, has been using Oracles software for its finances since last year after it outgrew a Microsoft offering, according to chief financial officer Peter Hovenier. Oracles sales rep was key in his decision, he said, as he looked at different options for his department.He really impressed upon the fact that this was a growing product for Oracle, he said. And while it was still early, I was getting good attention. Bloomberg",2016-11-08,sAMdv7ZZKtdxsbFcNWAj1L,Oracle has made a lot of progress developing a product that could compete with Amazon,competitor,22:22,Oracle widens cloud investments to battle bigger Amazon threat
-0.48,"Tokyo: Nintendo Co. brand-new console Switch will go on sale on 3 March, more than a decade after the debut of the blockbuster Wii gaming device, at a price of $300 with a new feature: an online gaming network.
				   
				While the connectivity is new for Nintendo, the Xbox One or PlayStation 4 console have had the feature for years. Still, the higher-than-anticipated price cast a cloud over the announcement: Wal-Mart Stores Inc. listed the new device on its Canadian website at a price that was above analysts estimates and slightly more than rival gadgets, and Nintendo shares fell as much as 3.9%.Nintendo is counting on the Switch to end years of pain at its console division, which released a successor to the popular Wii in 2012 that flopped. Not only was the Wii U the worst-selling major home console in history, Nintendo also shunned the smartphone market for years. The Kyoto-based companys long-awaited foray into mobile gaming got off to a rough start, with last months debut of Super Mario Run on iPhones disappointing fans and investors alike. That fueled concerns it was losing its ability to deliver hit entertainment products.The price surpassed most analyst estimates. Mizuho Financial Group Inc.s Takeshi Koyama last week wrote he expects the Switch to go for around $249 to $279. Macquarie Securities analysts analysts David Gibson and Aya Haruyama wrote this week they expect a price of around $250.At $300, the Switch would cost more than Sony Corp.s $260 PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Corp.s $240 Xbox One, based on current US retail pricing. Nintendo had botched the launch of its 3DS handheld console in 2011 by overpricing it at $250. It slashed the price to $170 five months later following poor sales.On Friday, Nintendo said the Switchs battery will provide three hours with regular gameplay.Our biggest concern is battery life, which we think will remain an issue, Macquarie Securities said.The Switch is a tablet-sized device that can be used anywhere but also connects to TVs and can be played with a wireless controller. As a portable gadget, the device sports a screen, attachable joysticks and battery. Nintendo is betting that the ability to play the same titles indoors and outdoors will appeal to gamers who now play one set of games at home and a different collection on their smartphones when out and about.Still, that means the Switch will have to compete with smartphones, which most people already own and use. Its unclear if consumers will want to carry another bulky device when smartphones already fill their spare moments with millions of games, apps and videos.There is a possibility that this proposed new game playing experience will not immediately be understood, Takeshi Koyama, an analyst at Mizuho Financial Group Inc., wrote in a report last week.Since its Wii peak about a decade ago, Nintendo shares have slumped by about two-thirds, losing more than $50 billion in market value. In October, Kimishima told Bloomberg the Switch will play a central role in restoring operating profits to a level of around ¥100 billion per year.

We will be taking a decision on the legal and financial viability of this after ONGCs decision on acquisition, said one of the two people mentioned above, a senior GSPC official.In an email, GSPC said that the proposed transaction between GSPC and ONGC is at a nascent stage and it is not possible to comment on either the timeline for completion, deal structure, valuation or use of proceeds.GSPC is the flagship company of the GSPC Group, involved in exploration and production (E&P) of oil and gas.

The exercise is aimed at finding out whether it is possible to induct a strategic and technical partner by farming out a part of GSPCs participating interest and improve the performance of the producing onshore blocks. GSPC has undertaken a business restructuring exercise to improve its credit profile.GSPC holds a participating interest in 24 blocks of which 20 are onshore, and four are offshore.

-0.57,"One look at the rally in the BSE Realty index and one would believe that the sector is doing very well indeed. Since April, it has returned around 30%, outperforming the benchmark BSE Sensex.
				   
				Certainly, the sectors woes have receded, although they are far from over. A June quarter earnings review shows some positive signs. The key is reducing inventory levels, which had soared to 18-24 month levels in some cases in the residential property market. This came about with a slowdown in new launches by developers, mainly in urban property markets.Meanwhile, commercial leasing activity, the bright spot in the sector, has been steadily rising in the past four quarters, supported by an expansion in the services sector.Although residential property sales have picked up in some regions, pan-India traction remains a distant cry. So, while the Mumbai and Bengaluru markets are showing slow sales improvement, the National Capital Region (NCR) is reeling under over-capacity. Firms such as DLF Ltd, with a high exposure to this market, will be weighed down by the burden of unsold projects for some more quarters.This explains why mid-sized firms such as Oberoi Realty Ltd, Godrej Properties and Sobha Ltd, which have a balanced exposure to residential, commercial and hospitality sectors, have weathered the downturn. Whats more, they have fewer legacy projects and less of a debt burden. That said, June quarter sales were not up to expectations across the residential real estate market. So, the recent rally in realty stocks is in response to positive developments on the macroeconomic front. One, the 7th pay commission recommendations of higher salary and pensions for government staff and retirees may trigger demand for mid-segment housing. Two, developers are selling non-core assets and monetizing land parcels to trim debt. Three, the regulatory changes to open the sector to investments is leading to private equity interest in realty projects, which could ease balance sheet pressure for developers.That said, it is safe to await a consistent increase in property sales before rushing in to invest in realty firms.",2016-10-09,sUdmPTYYxAxfaTvpDaeGoM,It is safe to await a consistent increase in property sales before rushing in to invest in realty firms,competitor,23:12,Real estate: flashes of recovery in some pockets

Xiaomi Corp. has just unveiled a device with a display covering almost the whole front after collaborating with iconic designer Philippe Starck.Along with improved customer service and a push to open their own retail stores, especially in smaller cities, Chinese smartphone makers have moved away from budget devices.

-0.9,"Last week, at the Mints 10th Annual Banking Conclave in Mumbai, one question was common for both former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor D. Subbarao and the current chiefs of large India banks: what do they expect from the union budget?
				   
				Subbarao wants the government to stick to the fiscal consolidation path but most bankers (not all) want Indias finance minister to focus on growth, even if that means a slightly expansionary budget. Chiefs of the three biggest state-owned banks also said they would like the budget to take note of the capital requirement of banks.Most analysts say that the government will be able to stick to the target of a fiscal deficit of 3.5% of gross domestic product, or GDP, in the current fiscal year that ends in March and aim for at least 3.3% fiscal deficit for 2018. The government has been diligently lowering the fiscal deficit for seven years since 2012 when the deficit touched 5.9% of GDP.Subbarao feels that even though there could be a slowdown in growth in the wake of the so-called demonetisation exercise, the government should adhere to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act which seeks to institutionalize financial discipline.ALSO READ | Banks eyeing big-ticket reforms in budget: SurveyThe original objective of the Act was to bring down the fiscal deficit to 3% of the GDP by March 2008 but in the aftermath of the global meltdown, the Act was first postponed and later suspended in 2009. A committee headed by former revenue and expenditure secretary N.K. Singh to reconsider reinstating the provisions of the Act submitted its report on 23 January, a week before the presentation of the budget.The report is not in the public domain but people familiar with its recommendations say the N.K. Singh Committeewhose members include RBI governor Urjit Patel and the chief economic adviser to the finance ministry Arvind Subramanianis in favour of fiscal consolidation but not sacrificing growth.While no one can question the importance of keeping the fiscal deficit low, the budget should also focus on reform in the banking industry. Many of the government-owned banks that have around 70% share of banking assets are laden with bad loans and need capital to stay afloat. Indeed, the banking system plays the most critical role in carrying out the governments development agenda but precious little is being done for the banks.ALSO READ | Budget 2017: Government should stick to fiscal targetsBut for them, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, the most ambitious financial inclusion programme ever undertaken in any part of the world, would not have been successful. Till 11 January, some 266.8 million new accounts have been opened and 210 million debit cards have been issued. One-fourth of such accounts still do not have any money in them but post-demonetization, the collective balance in such accounts has swelled to Rs69,000 crore. The banking industry also made sure that around Rs15 trillion worth of Rs1000 and Rs500 notes have come back to the system in 50 days in the biggest ever currency swap programme in the world.In his address to the nation on 31 December, a day after the banks closed the currency swap window, respecting the autonomy of the banks, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed to them to move beyond their traditional priorities, and keep the poor, the lower middle class, and the middle class at the focus of their activities. He announced cheaper home loans for the poor, 30 million debit cards for farmers, doubling the amount of loan (taken from banks as well as non-banking finance companies) to be underwritten by the government and higher fund flow to the small industrial units, among other things. The budget may have many more such schemes for rural development and employment generation but we need a healthy banking system to implement such schemes.ALSO READ | Budget 2017: Ten things to look out forThe RBIs December Financial Stability Report has pointed out that the gross non-performing loans of the Indian banking industry rose to 9.1% in September 2016 from 7.8% in March, pushing the overall stressed loans to 12.3% from 11.5% and it will rise further. While these reflect the health of the industry, the state of affairs in the public sector banks is far worse. Their stressed loans are at least 16%, more than three times than that of private banks. In fact, the report has said that the public sector banks may record the highest bad loans and lowest capital adequacy ratio, a measurement of capital against risk-weighted assets, among all banks. Has the government done anything meaningful to address these issues?The government had held an offsite with the banking bosses, Gyan Sangam, in Pune, in January 2015. Addressing the bankers, Modi had said it was a unique initiative and the first step towards catalyzing transformation. In August 2015, finance minister Arun Jaitley announced the grand Indradhanush planthe solution to the problems of the industry, which Modi explored in Gyan Sangam. It promised to tackle several critical issues, including appointments, capitalization, stress in the system, empowerment, accountability and governance reforms to revamp functioning of the government-owned banks.Estimating the capital requirement between fiscal year 2015 and 2019 at around Rs1.8 trillion, assuming 12-15% growth in bank credit, the government has committed to pump in Rs70,000 crore in phases till 2019 when the new Basel norms kick in. It also feels that the public sector banks (PSBs) market valuations will improve significantly following governance reforms, tight bad loan management and risk controls, significant operating improvements and, of course, capital allocation in successive budgets. Higher valuations, coupled with sale of non-core assets as well as improvement in performance would enable these banks to raise money from the market, the government had said.It also issued a circular that said there would be no interference from the government and the banks would be encouraged to take their decisions independently, keeping the commercial interest of the organization in mind.A government note describes the Indradhanush framework for transforming the PSBs as the most comprehensive reform effort undertaken since banking nationalisation in 1970 adding, Our PSBs are now ready to compete and flourish in a fast-evolving financial services landscape. If indeed setting up of the Banks Board Bureau with a string of vague and ambiguous terms, splitting the top post in PSBs between chairman and managing director and CEO and appointing a few private sector bankers as heads of PSBs are meaningful reforms, then Indradhanush has done wonders.Even though the credit growth has been far lower than what has been estimated, the banks would need higher capital as growing bad assets are eating into their capital but none has any idea whats happening on that front. The banks are required to set aside money or provide for their bad assets and that erodes their capital.As far as the Banks Board Bureau is concerned, I wonder whether even the members of the Bureau themselves know what they are expected to do. Its mandate includes selection and appointment of managing director and CEOs as well as non-executive chairman of PSBs, helping banks develop a robust leadership succession plan for critical positions, advising the government on the formulation and enforcement of a code of conduct and ethics for bank executives, and helping banks develop business strategies and capital raising plan, among others.Barring the top level appointments, all other assignments are vague and even here, the Bureau does not have the final say. One-fifth of Indian Overseas Banks loans have turned bad and it has recorded losses for six successive quarters till December (to the tune of Rs5,786.63 crore) but it doesnt have either the chairman or a managing director and CEO for seven months since its last boss retired in June 2016. Apparently, the Bureau recommended the executive director of a PSB for this position and it was cleared by the vigilance authoritya necessary precondition for any top appointment in a PSBbut a division of the finance ministry shot it down. Clearly, there is a disconnect between the ministry and the Bureau.The Bureau also recommended nine candidates for the posts of executive directors in various PSBs in September, but none of them has been appointed as yet. Moreover, it does not have the power to appoint the so-called non-official directors at boards of PSBs, many of whom are the root cause of mis-governance in banks.The governments plan to dilute ownership in IDBI Bank has also gone nowhere. Similarly, the employee stock option plan or ESOPs for PSBs remains a promise on paper so far.In sum, barring a few cosmetic changes, nothing significant has been done to revive the public sector banks. I would love to see finance minister Arun Jaitley using this budget to move forward with a concrete reform agenda.

-0.5,"San Francisco: Apple Inc.s fourth-quarter results were bolstered by robust early demand for the iPhone 7, analysts predicted, helping slow the pace of a sales slump for the worlds most valuable company.
				   
				After releasing a new version of its bestselling device in September, Apple likely sold 45 million units of all types of iPhones in the most-recent fiscal quarter ending 24 September, according to Wall Street estimates. Revenue probably slipped for a third straight quarter, by 9%, though thats smaller than the 15% decline in the preceding period, forecasts indicate.Unlike previous smartphone rollouts, Apple didnt publish first-weekend sales data after the iPhone 7s 16 September release. That means the companys fiscal fourth-quarter results, due after the market closes on Tuesday, will give the first major clues on how consumers responded to the new device.Apple benefited from an earlier product launch this time, giving the company a week longer than usual to market the device. Even so, Apples growth is being held back by rising competition from lower priced alternatives, especially in China, and smartphone saturation in many parts of the world. Shortfalls in components are also putting a lid on iPhone supply, analysts said.Apple will likely guide that iPhone 7 is off to a good start, but supply remains constrained, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster wrote in a note to investors on Sunday. He rates Apple shares overweight, or buy.For other analysts, the iPhone 7 is a stopgap ahead of a more significant upgrade in 2017 to coincide with the 10-year anniversary of the first iPhone.IPhone 7 is proving an effective bridge to the iPhone 10 super-cycle in 2017, where a powder keg of a dramatically aging installed base lurks just under the surface, Cowen & Co. analyst Tim Arcuri said in a note to clients last week.Chief executive officer Tim Cook may be relieved to see the back of the 2016 fiscal year. The company likely endured its first annual revenue decline in 15 years as global smartphone demand ebbed. Share buybacks and a beefed-up dividend helped limit the repercussions for Apple shares, which declined slightly over the course of the year. The S&P 500 climbed 12% in the same period.Investors will be particularly focused on China, where Apples sales decline has been more pronounced. Competition has increased in Asias largest economy from local rivals offering cheaper phones with similar specifications. There were 32% fewer iPhones activated in China in Apples fiscal fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, according to an estimate from research firm JL Warren Capital LLC.The iPhone 7 was released a week earlier than prior models, which is likely to boost fourth-quarter sales, according to Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski. Apple has struggled to meet demand for the device, which has been boosted by the problems endured by competitor Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., she said. That could help Apples sales in the crucial holiday quarter.The South Korean company recently ended production of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 handset after some devices caught fire. When Apple reports results on Tuesday, it will also provide a sales forecast for the final months of 2016. Analysts currently anticipate sales of $75.3 billion for that period, in line with its revenue a year earlier.With the smartphone market slowing, Apple has placed greater emphasis on its services business, which includes iTunes, iCloud and the App Store. The division has become Apples fastest growing and in the latest quarter it likely benefited from the popularity of Pokemon Go, according to Piper Jaffrays Munster.

-0.11,"Finally, in the last quarter (March) of fiscal year 2016, things did get better for Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T), after three quarters of titanic struggle. But even as it posted a stellar operating performance that beat forecasts on revenue, profit and operating margin, order inflows remained elusive.
				   
				If order inflows are an indication of the times to come, then the 9% year-on-year drop in fresh orders during the quarter is not good news. For the 12-month period ended March 2016, the 12% dip in orders inflows fell short of even the management guidance of flat growth. Not to forget that the management had watered down its estimate from 15% at the beginning of the year. Perhaps the loss of orders in the power segment and the pathetic state of the heavy engineering, metals, and electrical and automation segments explains this drop.However, set this factor aside, and L&Ts March quarter leaves nothing for investors to crib about. Consolidated net revenue jumped by 18.3% from a year back as the companys core business segmentinfrastructureclocked 20% revenue growth. Information technology and financial services too contributed sufficiently to revenue growth.Even better was the beat on operating margin. At 14.7%, it topped the 14-broker Bloomberg consensus by 220 basis points as it raced ahead of the year-ago number by 190 basis points. A basis point is 0.01%. Again, margin outperformance came from the infrastructure segment, which more than compensated for the deplorable performance of the heavy engineering and hydrocarbons divisions. Fortunately, these comprise a small portion of the overall business of the juggernaut.Operating performance trickled down and L&T saw a 19% jump in consolidated net profit, way beyond what the Street expected.This is not all. The management, in its media address, appeared optimistic of an economic recovery both on the domestic turf and in overseas markets like West Asia, other regions of Asia and Africa. And it is still sitting on a massive order book of Rs.2.49 trillion, assuring decent revenue growth over the next three years. Some analysts say that with a sizeable chunk of international orders, the company may not be able to sustain the March quarters operating margin in the near term. Interest costs during the quarter rose from a year back, underlining the pressure on working capital.The moot question is: will the stock continue to inch up as it has done in the last three months, after a spark in the March quarter results? Sure, the stock is among the best plays on the economy and has more often than not outperformed benchmark indices.Or, will a drop in order inflows dampen investor sentiment? Yes, the management has guided for a 10-15% growth in order inflows for fiscal year 2017. What must not be ignored, however, is that fiscal year 2016 too started on a similar note but then estimates were trimmed thereafter.

				The industry also wants government to focus on infrastructure, unveil measures to widen the tax base and lower personal income tax rates to boost consumption.Since last year, the government has started reducing the corporate tax rate with a view to bring it down to 25% by 2020. However, the progress has been a little slow, and only a few companies have been covered under the new tax regime so far. We would like this process to gain traction in the budget, said Pankaj Patel, president of industry body Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce Industry (Ficci), on Sunday.ALSO READ | Budget 2017: Finance minister Arun Jaitley may hike service tax to 16-18%The lending rates should also be brought down and easy financing should be made available for sectors such as housing. These steps can prove to be a confidence booster among the business fraternity and would encourage investment demand as well, he added. Patel said it was critical to reduce the individual income tax rates to boost consumer spending and encourage tax compliance, especially as the country has witnessed some amount of disruption, post-demonetisation. The current corporate tax rate works out to be 30% plus cess and surcharge. According to another industry body Assocham, despite the tax revenue showing smart growth despite demonetisation, the biggest challenge before the government is to revive the urban consumer demand and provide a huge stimulus to rural economy which had to bear the maximum impact of demonetisation.ALSO READ | Banks eyeing big-ticket reforms in budget: SurveyThe Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), on its part, said that inflation may be down, but it has to be seen in the context of glut in many crops, especially vegetables, resulting from excess output and cash withdrawal in November. CII also believes that with more economic activity entering the tax net post demonetisation, the government should lower corporate tax rate to 18% in the budget. Government has no doubt taken commendable initiatives and made fair provisions to minimize and reduce unnecessary litigation. However, much more needs to be done to further strengthen the dispute resolution mechanism in the area of both direct and indirect taxes, said CII director general Chandrajit Banerjee.

0.05,"Sydney: When Indias Tata Motors bought Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford in 2008, many investors thought then-chairman Ratan Tata was making a big mistake.
				   
				Ford was selling the units for less than half what it paid to acquire them, just as early tremors of the credit crisis began sapping luxury demand. The day before the deal was announced on 3 January, 2008, West Texas Intermediate crude reached $100 a barrel for the first time, suggesting a tough environment for gas-guzzling sports cars and four-wheel drives.Tatas Nano, a super-cheap one lakh rupee ($1,500) minicar pitched at Indias emerging middle class, was seen as the best prospect, and Jaguar Land Rover looked like an expensive distraction. Moodys and S&P both downgraded Tata Motors, and the stock fell almost 30% in the six months it took to complete the transaction.How have those prognostications turned out?Wrong on almost every count. Jaguar Land Rover now accounts for more than half of Tata Motors unit sales, overtaking the trucks and passenger cars produced by Tata Motors India in the past two quarters, according to annual results released Monday.Helped by a weakening rupee, Jaguar Land Rovers British-pound-denominated sales have risen more than fivefold since the takeover to Rs.2.24 trillion ($33.3 billion) in the year through March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tata Motors Indias are up a relatively modest 74%.Jaguar Land Rover is also more profitable, even after one-time costs of £224 million ($329 million) during the fourth quarter related to Takatas airbags recall and damage from the 2015 Tianjin chemicals explosions. Operating margins averaged 11% over the past five years, versus 1% in the domestic business.Hows the much-hyped Tata Nano doing? Not so well. With sales rarely rising above 2,000 units a month, the Gujarat-based factory that was set up to build it is only running at about 10% capacity. Like the netbook computers that were launched around the same time and likewise failed to change the world, its entry-level pricing couldnt quite compensate for quality that was also a bit bargain basement.Tata Motors India is now focusing its attentions on the stronger mid- and high-cost vehicle segments, and has revamped the Nano with a Rs.1.99 lakh starting price. Spare capacity in the Gujarat plant will be used to make its new Tiago, which costs Rs.3.2 lakh and upwards.What should Ratan Tatas successor Cyrus Mistry do about this situation? One option sure to delight investors would be selling the legacy Tata business to focus entirely on Jaguar Land Rover, as canvassed by Gadflys Andy Mukherjee in March. The problem there is finding a buyer for an unprofitable arm thats also more indebted than its upmarket stablemate.A better idea would be to make the best of a bad job and work at applying lessons learned from the British business. As Nissan has shown since its 1999 alliance with Renault, troubled carmakers are often only a few blockbusting designs away from success. Many investors nowadays regard Tata Motors India as an irredeemable basket case thats lurched from one crisis to another for decades. They thought the same thing of Jaguar Land Rover eight years ago.

0.66,"Crisil Ltds research and analytics business continues to prop it up at a time when bank credit growth lags and the investment cycle is yet to recover. In the March quarter, this segment, which accounts for some 65% of the firms revenues, grew its sales 21.8% from a year ago. A changing global regulatory environment and newer analytics products seem to be boosting this segments growth for Crisil, which started life as a credit rater.
				   
				Ebit (earnings before interest and taxes) growth for the research segment was 49.6% from a year ago, helped by expanding margins. Ebit margin grew nearly 6.6 percentage points from a year ago to 35.1% in the March quarter. One part of this rise in Ebit and margins in research could be explained by the depreciation in the rupee. Crisil registered a forex gain of Rs.3.3 crore in January-March compared with a loss of Rs.2.67 crore in the year-ago period.The rating business didnt do that well in comparison. Segment revenues increased by 5.2% and Ebit by 10.9%. While margins improved when compared from a year ago to 33.5%, they were still lower than the December quarter numbers. The ratings business has been lagging behind the research unit for quite some time now, simply because of the economic slowdown. Lower credit growth seems to have led to lower growth in bank loan ratings. Add to this factors such as a decline in government subsidy for small and medium enterprise ratings and rising competition in this space, and there is increased pressure on the rating business.Despite that, the research segment has boosted consolidated profit growth to 40%, the best in eight quarters. While an improving economy and increasing deals will benefit this business, there is some hope for the rating segment too. Declining interest rates could very well lead to an increase in short- to medium-term debt issuance and debt refinancing. That optimistic prognosis doesnt mean that investors would necessarily make a beeline for the stock. Crisil shares currently trade at 37.73 times their expected earnings for 2016. That is well above its five-year median price to earnings multiple.",2016-04-20,tFwA6kVS2hOkXufuuw4nrJ,"While an improving economy and increasing deals will benefit the research business, there is some hope for the rating segment too

-0.73,"Just when you think Bharti Airtel Ltd already has all the mobile spectrum it needs, the company goes ahead and buys some more. Last Friday, it announced it will pay Rs.3,500 crore to buy spectrum in the 2300MHz band from Aircel Ltd in eight telecom circles. This is less than a month after it agreed to pay Videocon Telecommunications Ltd Rs.4,430 crore for spectrum in the 1800MHz band in six circles. The spectrum in both these bands is suited for fourth-generation (4G) telecom services.
				   
				Growth for telecom companies is already being driven largely by the data segment; in Bhartis case, voice revenue has declined on a year-on-year basis in the past three quarters. In this backdrop, it makes sense to have adequate spectrum to support efficient data services.Analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd point out in a note to clients, With this deal, Bharti will have 490MHz of broadband (3G+4G) spectrum on aggregate basis across the 22 circles, versus 486MHz of all 4G spectrum owned by Jio. Bharti now has 4G-spectrum (i.e. 1800MHz or 2300MHz) in all 22 circles, and both 1800/2300 frequencies in 13 circles.Besides the wide coverage, spectrum trading has opened a new avenue for purchasing the hitherto scarce asset. In spectrum auctions, the only avenue available earlier, companies often ended up bidding up prices to extremely high levels. After adjusting Aircels spectrum valuation for its remaining validity of roughly 14.5 years, Bharti Airtel has ended up paying around 10% higher than the reserve price set by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.If Bharti had let the opportunity pass and waited for the auctions, it may have had to shell out a substantially higher amount. JM Financials analysts say, We now expect Bharti to focus primarily on filling up its 2100 (3G) and 1800 (4G) gaps in the next auction; reduced competition for 2300 augurs well for other 4G-contenders like Idea/Vodafone. Of course, the deal is a win-win for Aircel as well; this helps it reduce its debt by about one-fifth, according to news reports.While the deal augurs well for Bharti in the long run, investors must note that the benefits may not be visible anytime soon. As it is, the pace of data subscriber additions has slowed, calling to question the large investments on this segment. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds launch later this year could put a spoke in the wheel as well.Even so, these are early days of consolidation and, eventually, subscribers may veer towards telecom operators who provide the best service.

				In a special feature titled Man of Steel, the Sunday Times attributes the thousands of jobs saved in the industry largely to the sacking of Cyrus Mistry and Ratan Tata stepping in as interim chairman. Last weeks abrupt change of heart owes much to a terse board meeting in Mumbai on 24 October. At that meeting the board of Tata Sons, the parent company that sits astride an empire spanning steel to tea, sacked its chairman Cyrus Mistry and reinstated his predecessor Ratan Tata, the report said. Describing Ratan Tata as the architect of the £6.1-billion acquisition of Corus in 2007, it quotes insiders as saying that the 78-year-old tycoon was never comfortable with the idea of abandoning Tata Steels Welsh plant at Port Talbotthe UKs largest steelworks. Now he is back at the helm, Port Talbot has won a reprieve, it notes. Tata is said to have been painfully aware that the closure of Port Talbot would devastate the town already marred by poverty. As the head of the (Tata company) charity, Ratan is not like that. You dont want to get rid of vast chunks of people and create mass unemployment. Ratan was quite upset at the way he (Mistry) was dealing with Tata Steel. There were all these whispers that he (Ratan) did the wrong thing in buying Corus, the newspaper quotes an insider as saying. Nearly 11,000 British workers at Tata Steel have been rejoicing after the company has indicated that it would not take any dividends from its British plants until their profit tops £200 million a year. The company made the pledge last week as part of a plan that will keep the Port Talbot site in south Wales open until at least 2021. It promised no job cuts for five years and to pump £1 billion into its UK plants over 10 years. Tata said in a statement, The immediate target of £200 million provides sufficient funds to invest in the business and to manage working capital needs. However, beyond this level the business will balance the needs of all its stakeholders, including the financing of dividends.

0.69,"The March 2016 quarter will go down as one of the worst in the history of Indian banks as losses piled up and bad loans tumbled out of their cupboards. The five key takeaways are:
				   
				1) The central bank-instituted asset quality reviews full blast was spread over the second half of the year. Indian lenders added Rs.1.4 trillion in bad loans over the course of January to March. This comes on the back of Rs.97,404 crore bad loans addition in the December quarter. All said, gross bad loans for listed banks stood at Rs.5.8 trillion at the end of March, or about 8% of non-food credit. For state-owned banks, this ratio hovers close to 10%. This doesnt include restructured assets, which in many cases, would add half as much more to their stressed loans portfolio.2) The surge in bad loans was not restricted to public sector banks. Even big private lenders such as Axis Bank Ltd and ICICI Bank Ltd saw a sharp rise in bad loans, indicating that the rot runs deep. Whats more, the clean-up is not complete. Many banks have declared watch lists of assetsa good percentage of which they expect to go bad this year. For Axis, this was around Rs.22,000 crore and ICICI Rs.52,000 crore. Among state-run lenders, State Bank of India has declared Rs.31,000 crore worth of loans sensitive and Bank of Baroda about 27,000 crore.3) This big pile-up of bad loans necessitated higher provisions. Over the course of the year, banks had to set aside some Rs.1.75 trillion towards bad loans. Thus, the listed universe of banks in India ended up with losses of Rs.14,685 crore in the March quarter. This number is boosted by private bank profits. The combined losses of state-owned banks were higher at Rs.23,493 crore after a Rs.10,793 crore loss in October-December.4) These losses meant net worth got hit. For 25 state-run banks for whom data was available, net worth fell by Rs.65,350 crore, or 11.5%, in the six months to March. While the central bank had relaxed some provisions for recognizing capital, this kind of continued losses will start affecting their prudential ratios. For about one in three banks, stressed assets (net bad loans plus one-third of restructured loans) are higher than their net worth.5) With a precarious capital position, banks will find it difficult to expand lending. The current recapitalization plan of the governmentabout Rs.25,000 crore in a yearis not enough. Of course, there is a chance that many of these bad loans will be upgraded once the economy recovers and borrower firms generate cash. The wait for an economic recovery continues.",2016-06-10,tzzcv1ZhwJ0vmTqKfcci5K,"March 2016 quarter will go down as one of the worst in the history of Indian banks as losses piled up and bad loans tumbled out of their cupboards

				However, in a telephone interview with Mint, Neemuchwala said that Wipro is well-positioned and on its way to make itself a future-ready firm. The former Tata Consultancy Services Ltd veteran, who joined the company in April 2015 as the chief operating officer and took over as the CEO in February this year, has taken steps to improve Wipros delivery and sales capabilities. Edited excerpts: Due to slow growth and declining profitability, and the way technology is changing, many commentators and analysts have questioned the Indian IT outsourcing industry and are pronouncing the death of Indian IT. What are your thoughts? I would not agree with the death of Indian IT. Indian IT has always had the resilience or ability to transform itself. It has the flexibility, the nimble-footedness. One of our industrys core competencies has been our ability to train a large number of people. Now is the market changing? The answer is definitely yes. So what has made us successful in the pastis that going to make us successful in the future? The answer is certainly no. Will change be required? The answer is yes. Will Wipro be able to undergo that change? Absolutely yes. I am absolutely confident. Are we well-positioned as a company? The answer is yes. This is because I have always believed Wipro as a company is entrepreneurial. We are also very technology-centric. We have made investments in digital technologies, like Internet of Things and cloud. We are making the organisation simple and nimble-footed. We are democratising the operating structure where every single unit can run with that. We started hyper automation and now we are ahead of our plan. So going forward times for Wipro will be better than in the past and I wouldnt call it a doomsday scenario.Its now been over eight months and two full quarters with you as CEO. What has been, say, two heartening features for you as the boss and issues which have disappointed you, which you believe could have made your company do better?Two most heartening things which I have seen in the eight months are that our strategy and ambition resonates and percolates to employees and customers. This is very important for any CEO. Simply, because no single CEO can do magic in a company unless the CEO has the power of the organisation. And at the same time making employees believe that their future is tied to the future of the company. I am very glad that we have been able to do this and that is a very heartening thing for me. We had a very stable CEO transition (on 1 February Neemuchwala was appointed as CEO and his predecessor T.K. Kurien was appointed executive vice-chairman). We have a very stable top management team. The kind of changes we wanted to do at the top, we have been able to do without losing the senior leadership talent pool. The second thing is that as we started articulating our strategy, our customers are lapping up to this strategy. The newly-acquired and newly-built capabilities like Wipro Digital or Wipro Consulting or our hyper automation journey combined with Wipro Holmes, or our investments through Wipro ventures... we are able to take these capabilities to each one of our customers. On the other hand, the speed of change which is required and the speed of change a knowledge-based organisation can undergo is something which I would be happier if we could do it faster. Yes, we are an over 170,000-people-strong company. But the pace of change, the training, the way we are changing our processes, all of it I wish I could get done faster. Its not to say Im dissatisfied with the pace but it would be heartening if we could bring this change faster than what we are doing.Two-full quarters as CEO, and you have embarked on a journey by articulating six broad themes. Given these measures you have started, the management has said in the past that a complete turnaround will take time. Will it be fair to ask if the company can come back or say end March 2018 with industry-matching growth or Nasscom-projected growth numbers?Im always careful of putting a timeline and so I believe it is not unreasonable to expect this (by coming to industry-matching growth number by March 2018). I feel very confident and I see green shoots coming in a more sustainable manner. Im very hopeful that four-five quarters is a good time for a very visible outcome or metric for an industry-leading growth or margin.One of the things which is of concern now for many is that despite making three buyouts, with a combined revenue of $340 million, in the last financial year, and this fourth buyout of Appirio, Wipro is not able to record impressive growth. So on the merger and acquisition (M&A) front, how are you going to make sure Wipro is able to integrate buyouts well and scale up business?I think there are two parts. First is having a bold and risk taking ability to buy. And second is staying the course and making these acquisitions successful. We have shown that we certainly have the former. Now, its time to focus on the latter. So take for example, our acquisition of DesignIt (Wipro Ltd acquired Denmark-based DesignIt for $95 million in July last year). When we acquired it, we had 300 designers. Now we have 450 designers. That company on its own has never seen that kind of explosive growth. I feel very confident that we have the right balance where we dont give our buyouts such a tight embrace that we squeeze the company. We keep these buyouts in our shadow but not alone. I believe we have learnt from our past mistakes. Now HealthPlan Services (Wipro spent $460 million to buy HealthPlan Services in February this year) is a recent buyout but I do see very early synergy wins there. Although right now because of US elections and some issues in the Healthcare Payer market, there is a level of uncertainty. Cellent (Wipro paid $78 million in December last year to buy German firm Cellent) is taking a bit longer than the other two but that is because of cultural issues. Also, Im very focused that every business unit should not have more than one acquisition to integrate and digest. So Cellent is under manufacturing and Continental Europe. Appirio will sit with business applications. DesignIt sits with digital.These four buyouts bring over $550 million in revenue. So clearly M&A is going to play a big part of your ambitious target of becoming a $20 billion firm by 2020. What percentage of revenue do you expect to generate from M&A?We dont break out organic or inorganic revenue growth because it can be a bit misleading. But directionally, I can tell you that M&A will not be insignificant. It will be substantial and not small. The ticket size you are seeing is already bold from the Indian IT perspective. But we will not acquire to buy revenue or scale.",2016-10-24,u0swvRQUwz7X2V8n7hWWYN,"Indias IT sector has always had the resilience or ability to transform itself, says Abidali Neemuchwala ",company,10:45,IT sector not looking at doomsday scenario: Wipro CEO Abidali Neemuchwala

-0.76,"For a week in May, some of Instagrams designers, engineers and product managers met not at the companys Menlo Park, California, headquarters but at a rented house, stocked with grocery store snacks. 
				   
				There, away from computers and armed with pencil and paper, they explored a question important for the photo-sharing apps future: how do we get our users to shop? In particular, they wanted to figure out how to introduce shopping tools without making them so obvious that they would transform the app into a splashy catalog. Together they came up with 150 ideas. After an extensive process of elimination, the team settled on the design being unveiled this week: letting brands tag products in their photos, the way users tag their friends. Tap on the tagging descriptions to get more information, tap again to buy on the retailers site. Its the first test from Facebook Inc.s Instagram to kick off a broader strategy for helping people pick out and buy things, according to James Quarles, Instagrams vice-president of monetization. The team will gather data from users behaviour to figure out what to do next. Maybe theyll add a way to comparison shop, a way to search for products elsewhere on the app or even a Pinterest-like feature to save posts that inspire, he said. We are so well-positioned in this space, Quarles said. Instagram is super visual, we have a well-defined graph of your interests based on what youre following, and the serendipity of discovery happens every day through the ad products and who you follow.People have long been shopping on Instagram without a formal way to buy things. A crop of influencers on the photo app push fashions into popularity. Company researchers have noticed that users take screenshots of products they love, or direct-message them to themselves. But, like the design teams caution suggests, making shopping an actual app feature is a risky proposition.The main problem: shopping hasnt worked well in social media. Facebooks history is peppered with discontinued e-commerce products, like birthday gifts for friends and Facebook credits, which was a virtual currency for social games. The company recently introduced a Marketplace product that allows people to buy and sell to each other, but its launch was quickly marred when users started posting ads for drugs, sex and exotic animals. Twitter tested a buy button for more than a year, but the project faded and the head of e-commerce departed. Pinterest made a bigger investment in shopping, allowing direct buying on its site from thousands of retailers, but its still unclear how popular the tool is with consumers. Quarles said Instagram aims to learn from all these experiencesespecially from its parent company, Facebook, which has shared its notes. Instagram already lets retailers promote products in ads, but the shopping update would apply to regular posts, making it a more natural experience a more natural experience for users. The apps e-commerce ambitions are largeincluding international expansion and a video version of the productbut theyre starting small. Its testing its new feature with just 20 brands, including Kate Spade and Warby Parker, and not taking any cut of the proceeds.For J. Crew, which is one of the test brands, Instagrams product fills a gap in mobile shopping. For one, its image-based, which makes it much more amenable to inspiring people to buy products than Facebook, according to Jenna Lyons, J. Crews president and creative director. It has the opportunity to take a customer from the point theyre interested in a product to actually making a purchase. Its happening in the real world already, she said.Its been a little frustrating to us in the past to not be able to have people purchase on Instagram, Lyons said. Not only has it become a place for people to get influenced by their friends, but theyre walking into our stores with their phones and saying, do you have this?She is hoping the test will show that Instagrams method is subtle enough to not turn people away, but powerful enough to drive people to J. Crews site. I really hope it works, Lyons said.

-0.55,"German multinational corporation SAP SE may be best known as an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software firm but senior executives insist that it has successfully moved beyond ERP to providing cloud computing and digital solutions as well.
				   
				Until about 2010, 70% of our revenue globally was from ERP. At the end of 2015, only about 30% of our revenue was from ERP and 70% was non-ERP, Deb Deep Sengupta, president and managing director, India subcontinent region, SAP, said in an interview.Sengupta acknowledged that while the benefits of ERP became visible in large enterprises, there was this perception that for a smaller company, SAPs technology is very hard to adopt and very expensive too. To address the issue, SAP India introduced many best practices from the implementations it had done in countries such as Brazil and Latin America. We created some packages for micro-verticals (small, specialized industry segments) and created an ecosystem of implementation partners that did not exist earlier, Sengupta said.SAP India also started working with agencies that do nation-building such as the railways, utility companies, ports and airports. We also worked a lot with the defence and home ministries, Sengupta added.In 2010, SAP launched its High-performance Analytic Appliance (HANA) software platform, which enables data processing in real or near-real time for quick business insights and improved decision-making. HANA can be deployed on premise or on the cloud, a model whereby firms do not spend upfront on licensing and equipment but pay on a per-use basis.SAP has also spent billions of dollars on acquiring firms whose solutions are cloud-centric. Some examples include Hybris, SuccessFactors, Ariba, Concur and Fieldglass. These, Sengupta said, have helped SAP rise to the world No. 2 spot in terms of revenue from cloud computing applications in 2015. Globally, we now have over 200 million users on the cloud.Even the core ERP, now christened S/4HANA has been completely re-tooled. In less than a year since its launch in 2015, we have deployed this solution in more than 2,700 companies. It is available on the cloud and on-premise. You can also deploy it in a hybrid model, Sengupta said.The 20.8-billion company, which has about 8,000 employees in India, does not give a break-up of its India revenue, but Dataquesta Cyber Media (India) Ltd publicationpegged the companys India revenue at Rs10,705 crore in fiscal 2015-16.SAP dominates the ERP software market in India; Dataquest reporting its market share at about 47%. Its product portfolio includes analytics, customer relationship management (CRM), expense management, human capital management and business-to-business commerce.The key verticals for SAP in India, according to Sengupta, are manufacturing, consumer goods, professional services and public services. Banking, financial services and insurance is another rapidly-growing vertical for the company, even though competitor Oracle Corp. leads in this space.For Sengupta, digital is not just about the front end; its an integrated thing. Its about the experience, which well provide. He observed that while digital firms are building an offline presence, physical ones are going digital too, known as the phygital trend. Sengupta cited the examples of US sportswear brand Under Armour and the multi-brand digital marketplace of the Tata group in India, Tata CLiQ, as examples of companies going phygital. To cater to this need, SAP announced the launch of the SAP Digital Boardroom in October 2015. According to Sengupta, the boardroom is a digital approach that aims to contextualize and simplify performance reporting across all areas of business in real time. Built on the SAP Cloud for Analytics Solution, the SAP Digital Boardroom incorporates fully automated business intelligence capabilities that aim to dramatically improve the quality and speed of reporting as well as collaboration in real time.SAP is also providing cutting-edge technology solutions to its clients. For instance, it has around 100 engineers working on machine learning, and that team is constantly expanding, said a 1 December 2016 report by research firm Market Realist. SAP is hoping to leverage machine learning to strengthen its cloud-based human resources suite SuccessFactors. Besides machine learning, SAP has also stepped up its investments to drive blockchain innovation. Blockchain is the technology that underlies cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Zcash.If SAP succeeds in its machine learning efforts, it could reduce competition for its products and pave the way for more revenue, the Market Realist report said. But it also cautioned that SAPs aggressive push into machine learning would put the firm on a collision course with Alphabet Inc. (parent of Google Inc.), which is also heavily into artificial intelligence research.The Internet of Things (IoT) is another area of focus for SAP; it announced an investment of 2 billion over five years in the IoT segment. As part of this plan, SAP acquired Plat.Onean IoT services providerlast September.To be sure, SAP will have its fair share of challenges in the coming years, especially in cloud computing, said analysts. For one, SAP does not have its own data centre in India yet. Sengupta pointed out that SAP is tying up with local partners for cloud services in India, but analysts remained sceptical.The growth has been easy for SAP in India when it came to the top 100 enterprises and then another 300-odd large companies, but the joy ride ends now, said Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst and CEO of Greyhound Research. He pointed out that Indian firms are wary about data residing in a foreign country. Gogia added that SAP has not found many takers for its expensive HANA. Though some enterprises have technically bought HANA licences, there are only a few of implementations in the country, as not all ERP modules are ready yet on HANA. Another reason for the lukewarm response to HANA is the lack of skill sets on HANA in India, Gogia noted.The upcoming goods and services tax (GST) regime, which would need ERP to be modified or upgraded for compliance, could also pose a challenge for SAP, Gogia said. While SAP is mandating its clients to buy S/4HANA licences if they want to migrate their existing SAP solution to a GST-compatible version, other vendors are offering to supply the GST patch for free, Gogia noted, warning that firms may shift their custom to other vendors as they embrace GST.The competition is undoubtedly stiff with the likes of Amazon Web Services (AWS), CenturyLink, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and Salesforce offering public cloud platforms. AWS and Microsoft lead the pack among global public cloud platform providers for enterprise developers. IBM and Google offer competitive options. Oracle, Salesforce, CenturyLink and SAP lag behind, according to a 29 August 2106 report by Forrester analysts Dave Bartoletti and John R. Rymer.Among the megacloud providers, SAP is a challenger, the report said. The analysts pointed out that while the HANA cloud platforms greatest strength is in shielding developers from all infrastructure configuration tasks when working with SAP business suites, companies must determine whether the platform is a good choice to also build and deploy applications that are independent of SAPs business suites since the HANA cloud platform offers only a limited set of application development and delivery functions. SAP, according to analysts, is yet to step up to the full range of language run times, databases, and analytics services of the leaders, although SAP recently released an IoT service to all customers. As a new entrant in the market, SAPs partner roster for HANA cloud platform is small, as is adoption of its platform, the report concluded.",2017-01-16,uLYxZE6K7ZZ85besrpDTIK,"SAP, the German ERP software company, has successfully made inroads into cloud computing and digital solutions",competitor,00:42,SAP: The road beyond ERP
-0.39,"Singapore: Indias fuel demand growth is expected to slow by as much as 40% in 2017 from last year as a government-induced cash shortage hurts businesses, industry and car sales. 
				   
				The dent in demand growth in the worlds third-largest oil consumer is expected to be temporary, though, with India still taking up the third-biggest portionbehind China and United Statesof 2017s rise in fuel use on a barrel-per-day basis, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Indias fuel demand in 2016 grew at its fastest in at least 16 years as low oil prices boosted demand for gasoline and aviation fuels, but analysts say the nations currency troubles will put the brakes on this year. Indias oil product demand growth in 2017 is expected to drop to 160,000 barrels per day (bpd), from 270,000 bpd in 2016, according to Woodmac. We see Indian demand growth slowing ... due to the recent currency demonetisation drive by the Indian government, said Suresh Sivanandam, the consultancys Singapore-based senior manager of Asia Pacific refining research. Prime Minister Narendra Modis currency crackdown has led to a cash crunch that has severely hurt Indias overall output and consumer demand, with December factory activity contracting in its biggest monthly decline in eight years and last months car sales dropping the most in 16 years. Indias growth in both diesel consumptionused mainly for heavy industrial vehiclesand gasoline burned to power cars, is expected to slow, especially in the first quarter, traders and analysts told Reuters. And while this will dent refining margins for diesel, it is not expected to be enough to undercut a strong 2017 profit outlook for the fuel across Asia this year. The cash crunch ... is dampening growth in agricultural and other small-to-medium scale sectors, which are heavily cash-reliant, said Sri Paravaikkarasu, head of East of Suez Oil at energy consultants FGE. It will easily take three to six months for the dust to settle, she said, although long-term prospects remain strong, with spending on infrastructure projects and a resumption in economic growth and freight shipments supporting diesel. Diesel demand is expected to grow only 2% in the first quarter of 2017 compared with a year ago, less than half of the 5% growth rate seen in the first 10 months of 2016, said Tushar Tarun Bansal, director of Singapore-based consultancy Ivy Global. Actual oil demand growth may be lower than projected, though, cautioned an Indian refiner source, as consumers have been stocking fuel to take advantage of an exception given to old Rs500 and Rs1,000 for purchases of diesel and gasoline at retail pumps.

1.0,"When Britain voted to leave the European Union, it seemed like Tata Motors Ltd would be among the worst hit Indian companies. Its shares fell as much as 8% when the news hit the Street because of worries about the impact on its UK subsidiary, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR).
				   
				At first look, the companys June quarter results seem to revive some of those fears. JLRs profit before tax and exceptional items fell as much as 45% year-on-year, largely on account of adverse forex movement. In addition to the sharp fall in JLRs profit, the adoption of Ind-AS also worked against the company in the past quarter. Net profit on a consolidated basis fell by as much as 57%.But investors are likely to ignore these as one-off impacts and focus on the strong growth in JLR sales and the reception some of its new models have received in the markets.The company said in a call with analysts that the F-Pace model it launched earlier in the year has been received well and has a waiting period of three-to-four months. Launched in April this year, the F-Pace accounted for nearly 40% of total Jaguar sales last quarter. The XE did well, too, accounting for one-fourth of total Jaguar sales. In the Land Rover stable, the recently launched Evoque Convertible has created some excitement in the market.As a luxury car maker should, Tata Motors spends large amounts on research and development. With the recent success it has had with new product launches, it looks like these investments are coming good. To be sure, Tata Motors shares have risen by about 90% from its lows in February, when fears of a slowdown in China had hit investor sentiment. And the stock has not only recovered all of the losses since the Brexit announcement, but has risen compared with pre-Brexit levels.In the backdrop of improving sales and the success of new models, investors may ignore the large drop in the June quarter profit, since a large part of it was owing to currency fluctuations. The pound had depreciated sharply post Brexit, resulting in losses on derivatives contracts used by the company to hedge its exposure to other currencies. Besides, the restatement of assets and liabilities as on 30 June also led to forex losses worth £84 million.According to the company, a weak pound will result in losses only till the time the derivatives contracts it executed when the pound was stronger are in force. In the long run, a weak pound will work to its advantage, since JLR sells about 80% of its vehicles outside the UK. It does import 40% of its components, on which it will take a hit on the forex frontbut on a net basis, it will gain from a weak pound. Of course, Brexit could lead to other complications, such as incremental tariffs, but this depends on how the trade agreements are negotiated.Thanks to the adoption of Ind-AS, the profit for the year-ago June quarter was restated upwards by around Rs.2,500 crore, largely owing to the difference in the way gains/losses on forex derivatives is accounted for. Devoid of such a large gain this time around, profit fell sharply.",2016-08-28,uPBMemHoy2F3IKg63BGlGI,"Amid improving sales and success of new models, investors may ignore the large drop in June quarter profit as a large part of it was owing to currency fluctuations",company,23:36,"As JLRs new products impress, Tata Motors June quarter profit fall may be ignored"
0.25,"Bengaluru: As start-up exits continue to be elusive, venture capital (VC) firms have been forced to seek more time from investors to return their money.
				   
				Most VC firms in India started out in 2006 and 2007. Now, many of them, including Nexus Venture Partners, Kalaari Capital, Matrix Partners and IDG Ventures India, have already extended or will extend the timeline of their first funds by two years to return cash to their investors, according to a dozen VC firms and limited partners (LPs) familiar with the matter. LPs are firms that invest in VC firms.Usually, LPs are happy to offer extensions, depending on the portfolio of the VC. Most people are okay hanging on for two more years, if it means a better chance at extracting more value. Usually, LPs have an option of giving or not giving an extension, but they typically exercise it positivelywhen you want to get good returns, you have to give them some time, said Mohandas Pai, chairman of Manipal Global Education and an active investor in the Indian start-up ecosystem.The first funds of most VC firms expired this year; those that havent will do so next year. Funds are usually set up as 10-year legal entities, with clauses that allow for extensions of one or two years, sometimes more.The expiry of the first funds was collectively a seminal moment of sorts for Indian VC firms. It passed unnoticed because many of the bets made by VC firms havent paid off yet and no investor wants to highlight that, the people cited above said. VC portfolios currently comprise duds, struggling companies, promising young companies and the so-called unicorns, many of whose futures are far from clear.Two VC firmsSAIF Partners India and Accel Partners Indiaboth of which began investing in India before 2006, have bucked the trend. In its first two funds totalling just $70 million, Accel uncovered gems such as Mu Sigma, Myntra and Flipkart, which have already yielded exponential returns through sales of shares to other investors. SAIF Partners similarly returned its first fund to LPs on the back of blockbuster exits through the initial public offerings of Makemytrip and JustDial. Another VC firm, Seedfund, also generated attractive returns on its first fund of $14 million, mostly because of the gains from its early bets on RedBus and Carwale.However, even for Accel and SAIF, the success of their subsequent funds is far from clear. Its also unclear if Seedfund will continue to operate after two of its partners launched their own start-ups this year.Indias start-up business began in earnest when US-based VC firms such as Sequoia Capital, Matrix Partners as well as home-grown fund managers such as Nexus Venture and Helion Venture Partners set up shop in the country in 2006 and 2007. In that period, more than 20 VC firms launched in India.Investors were testing the strength of Indias consumer Internet market and software-building capabilities.After the initial boom and bust cycles that are typical in any Internet economy, three of these VCs, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Canaan Partners, shut shop, conceding that Indian start-ups wouldnt deliver meaningful returns or that they had placed the wrong bets.Some rebranded: Erasmic Venture Fund became Accel Partners; NEA-IndoUS Ventures shed NEA from its name then became Kalaari Capital in 2012; WestBridge Capital Partners spun off from Sequoia.For the most part though, VC firms plodded along for the first seven years and then reaped the benefits of the extraordinary 2014-15 funding boom for Indian start-ups. Companies such as Flipkart, Snapdeal, Ola, Paytm, Quikr and others that comprised early bets of VC firms raised billions of dollars at eye-popping valuations.Large investors in the US, Europe and Asia, who either missed out on the record public listing of Chinas Alibaba Group or were handsomely enriched by it, together with VC firms poured more than $9 billion into Indian start-ups, believing that the mobile Internet boom would yield their next big pay-off. Some early investors in Flipkart, Snapdeal, Quikr sold part of their stakes and realized massive gains. Three large acquisitions (Freecharge, Myntra and TaxiForSure) strengthened the theory that India start-ups will finally deliver exits.Traditional VC firms raised billions of dollars in new funds. And, why not? Their portfolios showed the kind of paper gains that would fill any LP with confidence.However, the rapid expansion of Amazon India and Uber India caught Flipkart, Snapdeal and Ola by shock (bit.ly/2dkf8J0). Most importantly, though Indias Internet market is huge in terms of number of users, but making money from these users is another matter altogether (mintne.ws/1TYtIRu).These two factors together with other smaller ones have shown that many of the investments made by VC firms in 2015 are simply unviable and the future of the VC scene in its current form hangs in the balance.To be sure, most investors are still sanguine about Indias Internet economy. The mobile Internet boom that is being turbocharged by the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd will attract hundreds of millions of potential new customers for start-ups. Ola has shown this year that it can hold its own against Uber; Flipkart, too, finally seems to be in the early stages of a turnaround. Plus, theres hope among investors that some newer investments such as enterprise product or SaaS (software as a service) start-ups will pay off.Its true that things havent gone according to plan, but LPs are still very positive about India. They realize it will take longer, but they also believe that India is a market you cannot ignore. They will continue supporting VCs.

				The average revenue per user (Arpu) at Rs.174 for the June quarter remained unchanged, compared with the March quarter, despite a price increase. Arun Kapoor, chief executive officer, Dish TV, says the company effected an average 4-5% price hike in packs in March, but that did not translate into better Arpus for the June quarter as it takes time for people to get used to it. Also, there was some downgrading that happened. Still, for the year as a whole, Arpu is expected to grow 3-4%, adds Kapoor. Even though the company intends to effect another round of price hike during Diwali, meeting the Arpu growth guidance could be challenging.Dish  TVs consolidated revenue increased 5.7% over the same period last year to Rs.779 crore. However, starting 1 April, the company changed its accounting of entertainment tax in keeping with industry practice. Earlier, entertainment tax was a part of operating expenditure; it is now netted off against subscription revenues. According to the company, on a like-to-like basis, revenue growth is 10.9%, compared with last year.To that extent, netting off entertainment tax from revenues did boost reported earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) margin. The measure showed a 200 basis points expansion to 34%. But, on a like-to-like basis, Ebitda margin has improved only slightly. Further, a free cash flow of Rs.62.7 crore in the June quarter is lower than the Rs.104.7 crore notched up in the March quarter. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Dish TV did well on the subscriber additions front, adding 402,000 subscribers. The company met its guidance of 1.5 million net subscriber additions in fiscal 2016. For the current fiscal year, Dish TV has a target of 1.5-1.9 million net subscriber additions. That shouldnt be an issue. If one assumes the June quarter subscriber addition run rate for the rest of FY17, then it would comfortably surpass the lower end of the guidance.Overall revenue growth guidance is 12-15%. Dish TV shares have underperformed the BSE-200 index since the beginning of the calendar year. One factor that could change the trend is better Arpus and a better Ebitda margin, considering the company has provided a guidance for 35% Ebitda margin for FY17. Investors would do well to watch those parameters in the coming quarters.",2016-07-29,uXM735InTSCNOoQECcHbIL,"Even though the company intends to effect another round of price hike during Diwali, meeting the Arpu growth guidance could be challenging

-0.63,"About six months ago, people working on hardware and the voice-activated Google Assistant for the Pixel phone started sitting next to each other at the companys Mountain View, California headquarters, hammering out minute details of its first phone.
				   
				The new seating arrangement illustrated a much larger shift underway at Alphabet Incs Google, which crashed Apple Incs smartphone revolution eight years ago by giving away its Android software and letting handset makers do the rest. Google software now runs on 85% of the worlds smartphones, but as voice control threatens to replace touch as the primary means of using a hand-held device, the company is experimenting with a different approach  more akin to Apples tight integration of hardware and software.The Pixels hardware and Assistant teams gather for happy hour every on Friday and have already received a prototype for the camera on next years phone, said Brian Rakowski, vice president of product for Googles Android operating system. Their ambition: to make the companys voice-powered digital assistant better than rivals such as Apples Siri and Microsoft Corps Cortana.We really wanted the Assistant on the phone to feel like a natural extension of the ways you ask Google for information, Rakowski said in an interview. Leaf from Apples book The fusion of hardware and software is key to that goal. Certain specifications are crucial for a high-performing assistant, such as a well-placed microphone and a powerful processor to crunch reams of data.Creating an app isnt enough; that requires a few clicks for users to get to it. The hardware and software teams worked closely on details such as the graphics that appear when users call up the assistant, settling on a flurry of colourful dots, which Rakowski called a whimsical touch to give a little bit of life to the home button. The Assistant is always at the ready on the Pixel phone and can be summoned by pressing the home button or saying the words OK Google.By integrating the Assistant into the Pixel, Google doesnt have to do negotiations with another handset maker  they can make it as tight as they want, said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, which offers a digital assistant by the same name.To make sure users get the best possible experience, the Assistant will live only on Google products such as the Pixel, at least for now.In the long term, however, it is unclear whether Google will keep it that way, or return to its original phone strategy and try to push the product out to the millions of smartphones running on other manufacturers Android phones, at the risk of offering a slightly lower-quality experience. Rakowski said making sure the Assistant works well on other phones would require a close level of integration with handset makers, beyond the typical work that happens on the Android operating system.We want all these features of the Assistant to work well and work quickly and be nicely integrated so it gives the right idea of what the Assistant can do, he said We dont want it to feel limited or bolted on in any way.He admits it could be challenging to execute the Assistant on some current Android phones.You cant do some of the always-on OK Google detection on some phones because they dont include the right hardware to do that, he said. In some cases, the microphone is not in a great position.Samsung going it alone?Whatever Google decides, there are already some signs that its Assistant may not be welcome on all Android phones. Samsung Electronics Co, the worlds top selling smartphone maker and the leading Android manufacturer, recently acquired Viv Labs, an artificial intelligence startup founded by the creators of Siri, and plans to weave the assistant into its phones. Having already ceded their operating systems to Google, Android manufacturers may be reluctant to delegate the digital assistant as well, people in the industry said.If we get to the point where the face of the brand is the assistant itself, that is totally a differentiator, said Babak Hodjat, co-founder of artificial intelligence company Sentient. They will be relegated to just pushing hardware. Google is coy about its plans. Over time, we want to bring the Assistant to as many people as possible, Steve Cheng, product management director for the Assistant, said in an interview, without giving details. Analysts expect that eventually Google will try to make money by taking a share of transactions brokered by the Assistant  such as when a user buys flowers from a store the Assistant just located. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai appeared to hint at that possibility during the companys earnings call on Thursday.The Assistant team talked about conversational actions as a way by which we can integrate third parties into the voice experience, he said. But he did make clear, whether on its own or others hardware, the shift from touch to voice-controlled assistants presents a prime opportunity for Google. As we went from desktops to mobile, its not like one replaced the other... It expanded the pie, he said. I approach this the same way.  Reuters",2016-10-29,uZTypcSENAEbzboSMPJD3I,"To make sure users get the best possible experience, the Assistant will live only on Google products such as the Pixel, at least for now",competitor,13:09,Google tries new approach with voice on Pixel phone
0.92,"Consistent performer HDFC Bank saw its profit growth skidding from the 20% level it has routinely reported in the past. Consolidated net profit grew 15% year-on-year to Rs3,865.3 crore in the quarter ended December, boosted by higher fees, interest income and other income.
				   
				Given the ambiguity around demonetization, this beat has come as a surprise since the Street was working with a lower number. A Bloomberg poll of 18 analysts had estimated a net profit of Rs3,770.8 crore. Shares of the private sector lender gained nearly 2% after earnings were announced on Tuesday. HDFC Banks loan growth was up 13.45% year-on-year in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 (Q3FY17), but lower than the 18.1% growth reported in Q2FY17. Loan growth in the quarter gone by was anticipated to take a hit due to outflows on account of FCNR (foreign currency non-repatriable) deposits redemption and SME (small and medium enterprises) repayments. Also, low-cost deposits were expected to be strong due to the demonetization exercise. The banks total deposits grew 21.1% year-on-year to Rs6.35 trillion in the quarter gone by.Net interest margin (NIM), which has been hovering in the 4.2-4.4% range for the past many quarters, moderated to 4.1% in Q3FY17. The mismatch in loan growth and deposit growth could be one of the factors that may have impacted NIM. In Q2FY17, NIM was at 4.2% and 4.4% in Q1FY17.Meanwhile, the banks asset quality remained stable. Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) moved up marginally to 1.05% and net NPAs rose 0.32% on a sequential basis. Net interest income rose 17.55% from a year earlier to Rs8,309.09 crore.

-1.0,"New Delhi: The board of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd(ONGC) on Thursday will consider issuing a bonus share to increase liquidity ahead of government disinvestment. 
				   
				With all of its about Rs14,000 crore cash committed in future projects and capital expenditure, the company is considering issuing bonus shares rather than cash dividends as a method of providing income to shareholders. The board on 27 October will consider the second quarter financial results as well as consider a proposal for declaration of bonus issue, the company said in a regulatory filing. Issuing bonus shares increases the issued share capital of the company, which is then perceived as being bigger than it really is, making it more attractive to investors. When a company issues bonus shares, the price of its existing shares comes down by about the same ratio as the bonus shares that have been issued. So, if the bonus issue is 1:1, which means they are issuing one additional share for each existing share, the market price of the share will roughly halve. ONGC had in December 2010 issued 1:1 bonus share along with a special dividend of Rs32 per share and a stock split. At that point, ONGC equity share of Rs10 face value was split into two of Rs5 face value. This was done as a precursor to the companys planned follow-on public offer (FPO) in the following year. The government is considering divesting at least 5% of its shares through an FPO this fiscal to raise about Rs12,500 crore. Prior to that, the company had in 2006 issued a 1:2 bonus issue.

What is it? The approximate number of companies that had contended the right of states to impose entry tax (levy on movement of goods from one state to another).Why is it important? The Supreme Court on Friday ruled against these companies and upheld states rights to levy entry tax and said that this did not violate the principles of free trade. According to estimates, companies would have to reportedly pay Rs30,000-Rs35,000 crore in entry tax to states. The government is trying to roll out the goods and services tax, which is to subsume all indirect taxes (including the entry tax) in the country, by 1 April 2017 but this could be delayed by another six months.Tell me more: Companies including the Jindal Group, Vedanta, Tata Steel and Steel Authority of India had argued that the imposition of the entry tax by states on the movement of goods into their respective territories was against the right to freedom of trade and commerce in India, which is guaranteed under Article 301 of the Constitution.Rs2,500What is it? The cash withdrawal limit at ATMs per day, up from Rs2,000, as per a government notification.Why is it important? One of the consequences of the shock announcement of withdrawal of old currency notes in Rs500 and Rs1,000 denominations by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday has been the long queues outside bank branches and ATMs. The governments apparent lack of preparedness at dealing with the moves aftermath has been criticised and there have been instances of daily wage labourers losing out on their livelihoods, low-income workers struggling to get their hands on cash due to not having bank accounts or means/awareness to transact digitally.Tell me more: After a review by the finance ministry, the limit of old notes of Rs500 and Rs1,000 that can be exchanged with new notes of Rs2,000 and Rs500 have been increased from Rs4,000 to Rs4,500 per day. The weekly limit of withdrawal from bank accounts has been hiked to Rs24,000 from Rs20,000 and the limit of Rs10,000 has been removed.6What is it? The number of years of negotiations to arrive at a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement between India and Japan signed during Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit to Japan.Why is it important? This will help India buy nuclear technology from Japan and for Japan, it is its first civilian nuclear pact cooperation with a country (India) that has not signed the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. However, this exception has been made by Japan reportedly due to a separate note that says that it would suspend nuclear cooperation with India if it conducts a nuclear test, though unnamed Indian officials have insisted that this is not legally binding but only included keeping in mind Japanese sensitivities. This has raised apprehensions that this may lead to re-negotiations with other countries with whom India has signed nuclear pacts to insert similar clauses.Tell me more: Another clause in the note reportedly says that if Japan scraps the deal in the event of India conducting a nuclear test, the latter cannot ask for compensation for disruption of electricity from a nuclear plant or for the resultant economic losses. Japan is the only country to have suffered the impact of nuclear weapons being dropped on it and, therefore, has been uncomfortable signing such a pact with India, which is outside the nuclear non-proliferation regime.0.2%What is it? The expected increase in global carbon emissions above the 2015 levels from fossil fuels and industry in 2016, according to a study.Why is it important? This is the third straight year with an almost flat growth rate and a significant decline from the 3% recorded in the 2000s. One of the main reasons for this could be attributed to a decline in emissions by China and the US, the two largest emitters. Emissions by China and the US are expected to decrease by 0.5% (from 0.7% in 2015) and 17% (2.5% in 2015) this year, respectively. However, researchers said it is too early to say whether this is a temporary blip or the making of a long-term trend.Tell me more: Indias emissions, which were growing by 6% per annum over the last decade, slowed down to 5% in 2015 and such levels are expected to continue as it expects to double its coal production by 2020.$40.85 billionWhat is it? Asset sales by Indian companies pending or completed in 2016.Why is it important? This is the highest-ever asset sales by companies since liberalisation in 1991 and around 46% higher than the previous high of $27.96 billion recorded in 2007. This could be one of the main reasons why private investment has been muted in the recent past. While the 2007 asset sales were due to investors wanting a bigger pie of Indias growth story (its economy grew by 9% or more between 2005-06 and 2007-08), 2016 asset sales are due to the high debt levels of corporates.Tell me more: Some of the deals in 2016 include sale of controlling stake in Essar Oil to Russias Rosneft and its partners for nearly $13 billion and sale of Jaypee Groups cement assets to Aditya Birla-controlled UltraTech Cement for around $2.4 billion.howindialives.com is a search engine for public data",2016-11-14,uhljG1EgkoKTaCSia10yCP,"In other news, $40.85 billion is the highest-ever asset sales by companies since liberalisation in 1991",company,11:30,"News in Numbers | New withdrawal limit from ATMs is Rs2,500 per day "

0.5,"London/ New York: The promise of production cuts from Opec and its partners sent oil rallying in 2016. Now traders want proof theyre delivering on those vows. It wont come easy.
				   
				The challenge: building a coherent picture from the morass of data that emerges at each step along the process, from the wellheads where the oil is produced, to the tankers that carry it, and the depots that store it.Unlike in the US, where output is published weekly, members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Opec, can take months to disclose their production. Beyond that, their data can be at odds with independent surveys, and countries have been known to cheat on such deals. With a rising US rig count offering a bearish undertone, each new hint on the accords implementation can be expected to swing prices.The market could be whipsawed more by data and headlines than in the past, said Michael Cohen, head of energy commodities research at Barclays Plc in New York, in a telephone interview. Data lags will be the primary problem in tracking cuts.Brent crude, the global benchmark, has surged 23% since 29 November, the day before the deal was sealed among Opecs members. The grade was trading at $56.86 a barrel at 1.07pm in Singapore. Future price increases for crude future will depend on a wide variety of signposts. Heres a breakdown on what to look for:UpstreamThe first indications will come at the start of next month, when media outlets such as Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters and Platts publish surveys of production. Estimates from institutions such as the International Energy Agency and US Energy Information Administration arrive a week or two later.As no ones counting barrels at Abqaiq, the Saudi oil-processing facility, these have to be modelled on computers, Barclays Cohen says. While we consider official production data published by Opec governments, we come up with our own estimates, said Lejla Villar, an analyst who estimates Opec output at the EIA, part of the US Energy Department. We look at crude oil loadings, estimated domestic consumption and refinery runs, storage, and whatever else might be relevant.Opec wont publish production levels until the middle of next month. Even then, the waters will be muddied as the organization provides two sets of data: the one used to monitor the agreement, compiled from the surveys described above, and numbers submitted directly by member governments, which can differ significantly.Monitoring the 11 non-members collaborating in the deal could be even harder, as data for the smaller producers like South Sudan and Equatorial Guinea are very patchy.At the moment its hard to be sure how much announced production cuts have been followed or matched by actual changes, said Damian Kennaby, director in the oil markets team at IHS Markit Ltd, whose estimates are among the external ones used by Opec. There are very few data on current production numbers and balances.To provide more clarity, Opec and its partners have established a monitoring committee, to hold its first meeting in Vienna from 21 January to 22 January, though the panel hasnt yet said ind detail how it will operate.MidstreamWhile the agreement applies to production, changes in exports will be felt more acutely by the international oil market. National producers notify customers months in advance what cargoes are available, which means some details on exports are already known. Iraqs shipping schedules, for instance, show the countrys sales will increase rather than decrease next month, though the country subsequently said buyers should prepare for lower volumes.Once the oil is on the water theres a range of services dedicated to following its flow, from ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg to companies such as Petro-Logistics SA and Oil Movements. Satellite-tracking means these shipments can be estimated almost in real-time.Still, a drop in exports might not guarantee a change in production, according to the EIA.The question of storage is the key unknown when estimating production using export data, said the EIAs Villar. Its difficult to know how much of the lifted crude each month comes from storage and how much from production in that particular month. Furthermore the size of the cuts, at just 4% of Opecs total output, is not necessarily enough to have an impact on the number of tankers, said Olivier Jakob, managing director at consultants Petromatrix GmbH.StockpilesClearing bloated oil inventories, rather than achieving a particular price, has always been the stated aim of Opecs intervention. The group estimates that the worlds tanks are overstuffed by more than 300 million barrels, or enough to satisfy China for almost a month.Yet if stockpiles are the most important metric, the problem is that they are perhaps the most lagging, with data from the IEA arriving about two months in arrears.The agency previously assumed inventories wouldnt drop until the end of 2017. It now estimates that Opecs cuts could start to deplete inventories as early as the first quarter, which means data from this definitive gauge would arrive in April or May. Opec, meanwhile, has said that while the deal will speed up the re-balancing of the global oil market, it wont result in demand exceeding supply until the second half of the year.Even if Opec delivers the cuts promised, theres still the risk of backsliding if their competitors in the US respond by ramping up drilling, said Chip Hodge, who oversees a $12 billion natural-resource bond portfolio as senior managing director at John Hancock in Boston. If activity picks up dramatically here, it might push other producers into cheating because of what that means for prices, he said.

0.39,"Singapore: For years now, Indias generic drugmakers and their cheap copycat pills have raised the blood pressure of storied multinationals. Increasingly, though, the challengers are getting a taste of their own medicine.
				   
				For shareholders in these once-successful Indian stocks, the prognosis looks far from reassuring. A market capitalization-weighted index of the top six producers of generic treatments has lost a quarter of its value over the past year, after jumping ninefold since April 2009.The rudest shock to the industry has come from the US Food and Drug Administration. Its issued eight warning letters to Indian drugmakers since October, hauling up companies including Sun Pharma and Dr. Reddys Laboratories, the biggest and third-biggest generic producers by market value, for infractions ranging from using buckets to collect rainwater from leaky ceilings to not doing enough to prevent possible manipulation of lab data submitted to the regulator.Since October 2015, 35% of all warning letters relating to violation of good manufacturing practices have been targeted at Indian facilities, according to Goldman Sachs. Lupin, the second-biggest Indian generic company, saw its share price tumble 9% on Friday after posting better-than-expected quarterly profit. The one-day slide, the steepest in almost eight years, was fueled by concerns that FDA approvals for products made in its key Goa manufacturing unit may not be forthcoming soon. Lupin said on an earnings call that its facilities had been inspected as many as 12 times over the past year.Still, there are at least three reasons to expect a recovery in the medium term. For one, the market for generics and biosimilars has plenty of room to grow. By the end of this decade, drugs worth $190 billion in annual sales will be going off patent, globally. Second, treatments are moving away from simple tablets and capsules to more complex applications such as injections and inhalers. Assuming that the top Indian generic drugmakers succeed in cracking the code of complexity, as Goldman analysts term it, their stalling operating margins could start expanding again.Finally, rapidly aging populations in both developed and developing countries create a powerful incentive for governments to cut public healthcare costs by promoting cheaper medicines. For instance, Japan is targeting 80% generic use between 2018 and 2020, up from 56% by volume last year. To make the most of this opportunity, the industry will first have to bring down its cost of equity, which has shot up to between 13 and 14% for the top three Indian drugmakers, up from 9 to 9.5% three years ago.The easiest way to soothe investors nerves will be for companies to stop flunking their regulatory fitness tests.

0.08,"Among power utilities, public sector enterprises NTPC Ltd and Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd are viewed as safe investments. The companies work on a regulated business model and did not make oversize bets till now. This strategy by and large helped them avoid the pitfalls their private sector peers encountered and deliver superior stock returns. 
				   
				But changing market conditions and regulations are testing this thesis, especially for NTPC.After altering the incentive formula to actual utilization instead of power plant availability, regulator Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) is now proposing to change the fuel costs calculation mechanism. Against the current mechanism of as fired basis, CERC stipulates that NTPC calculate the gross calorific value (GCV) of the coal on arrival basis.Through this, the regulator  wants to make NTPC accountable for the heat loss if any from the unloading point to the time coal gets fired. If implemented in the new format, the order can raise the companys electricity production cost as the coal is said to see noticeable loss in GCV in transportation. The order right now does not apply to all plants. But if extrapolated, then NTPCs earnings estimates may see significant cuts.The development comes amid a changing power sector landscape. Increasing availability of cheaper electricity in the spot or merchant power markets means states are no longer showing enthusiasm in signing long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs).In fact, some states are even said to be backing down on high-priced agreements and are meeting their electricity requirements through short-term contracts. These factors are raising questions about NTPCs ability to recoup its returns from the earlier setback of the change in incentive calculation formula from plant availability to actual utilization method.According to Edelweiss Securities Ltd, this uncertainty can weigh on the NTPC stock and drive its underperformance vis-à-vis Power Grid, whose earnings are seeing no such risks. Power Grid gained 34% in the last one year, compared to NTPCs 16%. The bigger challenge is whether these orders mean that the regulator is incentivizing distribution/transmission vs generation, and if so NTPCs elusive RoE (return on equity) pick-up may get pushed back, Edelweiss said in a note.Of course, this is not to say NTPC is losing its competitive advantage. The order can be appealed. NTPC is still better off when compared with private electricity producers due to its strong financial position and profitable PPAs.But changing regulations and risk to returns mean NTPCs earnings lack Power Grids certainty. Further the latters earnings are seeing positive momentum, thanks to high capacity additions the company is expected to see this year.",2016-10-13,vDEotnm9QFbgx8ewaJVAxJ,Changing regulations and risk to returns mean NTPCs earnings lack Power Grids certainty,competitor,01:50,NTPCs regulatory woes increase Power Grids appeal

-0.48,"New Delhi: Toyota Motor Corp., the worlds largest car maker, plans to build an India-specific model with a strong focus on hybrid technology, a top official at Japanese companys local unit said in an interview. 
				   
				The impetus behind Toyotas plan for a new car is Indias Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) norms, that seek to ensure that the mileage of cars on Indian roads improves by 10% between 2017 and 2021 and 30% from 2022 while carbon dioxide emissions comes down to 108 grams per litre starting 2022. The mileage improvement will be decided on the basis of litres of fuel consumed by a vehicle to run 100km. The move is targeted at  reducing the carbon footprint of the automobile industry. It is the first time  such norms have been introduced in India.ALSO READ | Global carmakers line up hybrid cars for India, but price still a hurdleToyota, which has a diesel-heavy portfolio of big vehicles, may find it difficult to meet CAFE II norms, effective from 2021, without  hybrid technology, admitted N. Raja, director and senior vice-president (sales and marketing), Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt. Ltd. Even petrol cars wont help, he said.When CAFE III comes (after 2023)90 grams per litre of carbon dioxide emissionreal hybrids will have to come, not the mild ones, Raja said, adding that the companys engineers from Japan have begun studying the Indian market and will take at least five years to build an India-specific model with true hybrid technology. Hybrids offer better fuel economy and lower running costs.Toyota has been a pioneer in hybrid technology since 1997, especially with several  generations of the Prius. Today, Toyotas range of six hybrid cars encompass small hybrids , family-sized cars like the Toyota Prius, even station wagons.ALSO READ | Mercedes-Benz to bring hybrid, electric cars to India in 2018The carmaker seems to have launched from the failure of some its smaller cars in India.  One thing is clear that after Etios and Liva, the platforms need to be global to get economies of scale. They will get support from global platforms but suit Indian conditions, Raja said.Localization of hybrid technology will be the challenge, he said.Localization has to happen... if you are looking at hybrid systems to come or if you are looking at a valuable price proposition, you need localization, Raja said.According to Anil Sharma, principal analyst, IHS Automotive, a hybrid power train does not really make sense for the Indian market unless there are efforts made to localize the technology. Then it is altogether a different ball game. Indian market will gradually move in that direction to realize the potential of hybrids. Toyota may want to have a first movers advantage. But all of it comes at a cost, Sharma said.ALSO READ | Maruti Suzuki, parent firm working to develop low-cost hybrid carsToyotas efforts in this direction  come in the wake of a ban on sale of vehicles above 2,000cc in Delhi that was effected in December 2015 and lifted in August 2016.

0.33,"Sydney: Australia should follow Indias lead and scrap its biggest bank notes, UBS Group AG said.
				   
				Removing large denomination notes in Australia would be good for the economy and good for the banks, UBS analysts led by Jonathan Mott said in a note to clients on Monday. Benefits would include reduced crime and welfare fraud, increased tax revenue and a spike in bank deposits, he said.The report came after India last week banned its existing Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes as part of a crackdown on tax evasion and the black economy that the government hopes will force people to declare unaccounted income and boost tax coffers. The government is issuing newly designed Rs500 and Rs2,000 bills with additional security features to deter counterfeiters.In Australia, 92% of all currency by value is in A$50 and A$100 notes, the larger of which is rarely seen, according to the UBS report. Removing bigger denominations would boost digital payments in a country where the use of cash payments is continuing to fall, the analysts wrote.Since 2009, ATM transactions in Australia have fallen 3.4% a year, while credit-card transactions have increased 7.3 % a year, UBS said.The programme would also be positive for banks. If all the A$100 notes were deposited into accounts at the lenders, household deposits would rise by about 4%, the UBS analysts said. That would likely be enough to fill the big banks regulatory-mandated net stable funding ratios and reduce reliance on offshore funding, they said.The European Central Bank in February said it was considering withdrawing 500-euro notes because of an increased conviction in world public opinion such high-value notes are used for criminal purposes.

				It will receive an upfront payment of Rs11,000 crore, besides B class non-voting shares in the tower company.These shares will provide 49% future economic upside from the business, based on certain conditions, the company said in a statement.The long pending sale failed to cheer both stock market investors and credit rating agencies. RComs market capitalization has risen by around Rs200 crore since the deal was announced. This is no more than a drop in the ocean, considering that the companys market capitalization had fallen by around Rs13,000 crore so far this year. Investors seem to be ruling out any major upside from the 49% holding through non-voting shares. The value of the retained stake depends on the conditions set by Brookfield, which are currently unknown. According to an analyst with a domestic institutional brokerage, It is evident investors arent factoring in an upside from the retained stake; after all, RComs market value hasnt changed dramatically and still is only around Rs8,900 crore.As the things stand, i.e. assuming that the Rs11,000 crore valuation for a 51% stake is fair, RComs towers have been valued at around $74,000 each. This is understandably at a huge discount to Bharti Infratel Ltd, whose towers are valued at around $100,000. One of RComs large tenants, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, is reported to have contracted rentals that are considerably lower than market rates. As such, profitability and return ratios of RComs tower assets are likely to be lower than peers.Its also important to note that credit rating agency Moodys Investors Service has retained its cautious view on RComs debt. RComs B1 corporate family and senior secured ratings remain on review for downgrade despite signing a binding agreement with Brookfield Infrastructure in relation to the sale of RComs tower assets, Moodys said on Thursday. As the rating agency points out, there are still a number of imponderables. The wireless entity that will emerge after the proposed merger with Aircel is expected to be heavily indebted. Operationally, the wireless business is expected to be among the worst hit as big boys Jio and Bharti Airtel fight it out by lowering tariffs. It also remains to be seen whether the retained businessincluding undersea cableswill be able to service the debt that remains on the companys books.An RCom investors best bet is that the firms books are adequately spruced up to make it a suitable match for an acquirer such as Jio.

-0.49,"Global economic growth has slowed considerably in the past few years and black swan events have only aggravated matters. The US economy grew slower than forecast for the first two quarters of this year, and it is likely to grow at around 1.5% for the whole year. No wonder Chinese and Indian economies are getting the attention they are from the global community. However, some experts are worried that an untoward event might occur in China, hurting its development and, by consequence, the entire world.
				   
				China is still the main engine driving global economic growth. During the first half of this year, its economy grew at the rate of 6.7%, reaching 34 trillion RMB. Seven hundred and seventeen million new jobs were created in urban areas, retail inflation rose to 2.1% and per capita income rose by 6.5% nationwide. The economic structure continued to improve, with the contribution of the service sector to the economy reaching 59.8%. Transformation of the economic development pattern saw progress. Fiscal and financial reforms as well as the reform of state-owned enterprises also witnessed steady progress, and innovation started playing a bigger role in economic growth. Although the non-performing loan ratio of commercial banks rose to 1.81%,  the overall financial system remained stable with no systemic financial risk. Overall debt ratio of central and local governments stood at around 40%, which is quite low when compared with developed countries. The fiscal deficit rate was only 3%, still under the internationally recognized safety limit. The process of reducing capacity has already begun in iron and steel, and coal industries. The aim is to reduce production of crude steel by 45 million tonnes (mt) and of coal by 2.5 mt this year. Production of crude steel and coal will be reduced by 100-to-150 mt and 500-to-800 mt, respectively, in the next five years. This de-capacity process is aimed at improving the economic and energy structure of the Chinese economy, so that 1.3 billion Chinese people can lead a healthier life in a cleaner and greener environment. China is fully capable of achieving 6.5-7% growth this year, and its contribution to the worlds economic growth will remain around 25%. The new round of economic reforms, rapid urbanization, technological progress, improvement in quality of labour and deepening of international economic cooperation will support Chinas medium- to high-speed economic growth in the long run.However, owing to the large size of the Chinese economy and some structural, cyclical and external factors, the transformation and upgradation of Chinas economic development pattern will require more time. The country faces many difficulties in the task of promoting economic restructuring and upgrading, and even more difficulties in fulfilling the responsibility of boosting world economic growth.The good news, nonetheless, is that this year India is still the third largest engine pulling the world economy forward. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has focused on economic reforms and economic development since taking office, and launched many encouraging plans such as Make in India, Smart Cities and Startup India. He has travelled far and wide within India and visited various countries around the world. He is perceived as actively promoting economic cooperation between India and the rest of the world. The business environment in India has also witnessed improvement, and foreign investments have increased significantly; infrastructure has gained momentum, fiscal consolidation has strengthened, and inflation has come down. India, like China a few decades ago, is seeing the setting up of industrial parks, construction of new skyscrapers every day, and a continuous forward extension of railways and roads. India has remained the fastest-growing major economy in the world for the last two years. On the back of a great monsoon, this year is going to be a bumper year for Indians. Timely monsoon and bumper crops would help India achieve 8% GDP (gross domestic product) growth as hoped by finance minister Arun Jaitley. It would increase Indias GDP by nearly $180 billion, which may be only about $100 billion less than the increment of the US economy. It deserves mention that India has firmly taken over the role of the third engine driving global economic growth.During a meeting, Jayant Prasad, director general of the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, told Liu Jinsong, charge daffaires of the Chinese embassy, that our confidence in the future of Chinas economy is just like that in our own economic outlook. In the present era of profound economic globalization, our big world has turned into a small global village where the fate of every country is so closely intertwined with anothers that no one can go it alone. The Chinese and Indian economies are highly complementary to each other as reflected through increasing number of cooperation projects. Indias growing economy is actually helpful in easing the downward pressure on Chinas economy. Only if China and India help each other and forge ahead can they bring hope to themselves in a very depressed world economy and illuminate the world as well.

-0.18,"Sometimes, just sometimes, it is possible to feel sorry for Big Pharma. One such moment came late last month when Eli Lilly and Co. announced that an Alzheimers drug, solanezumab, which had been under development for years, had failed in a late-stage clinical trial. Eli Lilly has invested nearly $3 billion over the last 30 years in efforts to develop a drug for Alzheimers, which causes progressive loss of memory and cognitive function. It has seven Alzheimers medicines in various stages of development but sadly none so close to commercialization. Solanezumab failed in Phase 3 trials, which normally have an 80% chance of success.
				   
				The failure is a major setback in the fight against Alzheimers not just in the US where it affects 5.4 million people, but also in the rest of the world, including India, which has over 3.7 million patients. With no known medicine capable of preventing or ameliorating the devastation caused by it, solanezumab was a great big hope all round. The pharma industry has already seen 15 straight failures on late-stage Alzheimers trials.The battle against Alzheimers may not yet be lost though this is a huge blow. Nor will Eli Lilly fold away though its stock dropped 14% immediately after the announcement. The company does have more Alzheimers drugs in its pipeline and companies like Novartis AG, Merck & Co. Inc. and Biogen Inc., will continue their pursuit of treatments for it.But it is an expensive loss. Analysts had already slotted solanezumab as a blockbuster, likely to bring in billions of dollars in sales over the next few years. Those are much-needed revenues, profits from which would drive future moonshots in the battle against diseases. Sadly, in the clamour to criticize pharma companies for their often usurious pricing, we tend to forget how dicey the process of developing a new drug formulation is. This year itself, Clovis Oncology stopped all development work on rociletinib, a drug which was expected to treat lung cancer, following its failure to get US Food and Drug Authority (FDA) approval. Similarly, Celldex Therapeutics, the Texas-based biotech firm, abandoned further development work on its brain cancer drug rintega after it failed Phase 3 trials. Data from the FDA shows that only about 7% of the drugs that enter Phase 1 clinical trials go all the way to the market.Also read: High prices today, effective drugs tomorrowCompanies like Turing Pharmaceuticals, under its much-reviled CEO Martin Shkreli who earned the rightful ire of patients and industry watchers when he hiked prices of its essential drugs manifold, as well as Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., have turned the spotlight on Big Pharmas egregious practices. Sadly, pharma companies are also best positioned to develop new drugs. Research & development in pharma is unlike that in any other industry.A Samsung can afford to release a Galaxy Note 7, sell it to 2.5 million customers, before having to withdraw it after 35 of them caught fire. Its withdrawal hurt the company but did not stop either Samsung or Apple or any other phone maker from trying to launch another smartphone with similar features.Most new drugs formulations come out of the US where almost 75% of clinical trials in medicine are paid for by private companies. The best that governments across the world do is to provide grants and loans for research and facilities at various institutions and universities. But between basic discovery research and late-stage development comes the crucial task of proving the value of the said drug. This costs big money which is often hard to come by and the exercise is fraught with so much risk that the industry dubs it valley of death. Of course, for those who choose to traverse this valley, the rewards are huge. Thus, by 1993 the US government had spent nearly half a billion dollars developing the ovarian and breast cancer drug taxol which was then picked up for marketing by Bristol-Myers Squibb. The companys subsequent sales of the drug worldwide brought in nearly $9 billion.Even as we grapple with this dilemma of late stage capitalism at its best and worst, Big Pharma, even if it is driven by avarice rather than public good, is our best punter to make the kind of bets needed to fight diseases like Alzheimers. If Eli Lillys failure with solanezumab, weighs the odds against further R&D in the area, it would be a calamity.Sundeep Khanna is a consulting editor at Mint and oversees the newsrooms corporate coverage.

				Americas clean-energy iconthe founder of Tesla Motors and SpaceXriled up many of his supporters this weekend by offering a decidedly tepid criticism of President Donald Trumps executive order restricting immigrants and refugees from seven predominantly Muslim nations.He sent a quick follow-up message that was a bit more direct, but it wasnt shared by as many people.ALSO READ | Elon Musk asks Twitter followers for advice on Trumps immigration orderAs thousands of angry protesters descended on airports and federal courthouses around the nation to decry the ban and prevent refugees from being sent home, Musk kept on tweeting. It only made things worse. He even offered to take suggestions for possible amendments to Trumps Strategic and Policy Forum.Some people had some thoughts to share. And even a few amendments. Since Friday, his Trump-related tweets have attracted almost 10,000 direct replies by anti-Trump protesters, some who call themselves the Resistance. A call for input, of course, only invites internet meme-ing in situations like this, and it reminded everyone online that Musk is participating in two advisory roles for the new administration, and that hes publicly supported Rex Tillerson, the former CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp., for Secretary of State. Thats an especially controversial endorsement from a man who has pledged his lifes work to getting humanity off fossil fuels. The resistance to it all was fierce ...and relentless ...and in some cases, harsh. Twitter dogpiles are rarely a venue for nuance. If they were, one might note that Musk is a unique case, perhaps in all American business leadership, that might invite at least a little consideration from the left. First, hes devoted his considerable fortune to advance clean energy. Tesla single-handedly forced the automotive industry to take electric vehicles seriously, and its Model 3 electric car is the leading contender to become the first mass-market EV. Musk was also chairman and biggest investor in SolarCity, the biggest US installer of rooftop solar, before Tesla acquired the company outright.ALSO READ | US colleges to Donald Trump: Keep outOne of his biggest goals all along, was to make clean-energy alternatives mainstream, to break down the partisan ideology of electric car-buying by making plugin cars that are the fastest and coolest vehicles money can buy. His solar roof tiles are groundbreaking technology, and his unique solar financing model removed financial barriers to help people start saving money from day one. The goal was to make clean energy products that were no-brainers, regardless of a persons politicsand that might just be his greatest contribution yet. From a more practical standpoint, Musk is also the founder of SpaceX, and as such has everything to lose by alienating Trump. SpaceX has revolutionized space travel for the 21st century: Musk built the only American-made rocket engine available at the time and the only alternative to Russian engines (which America had become wholly dependent on). Though SpaceX cut the cost of space travel dramatically, it still relies on US contracts and access to government spaceports. National security rules around rockets are severe: SpaceX, for example, isnt allowed to hire foreign nationals. Its a source of frustration for Musk, who is himself an immigrant from South Africa, but a feud with an easily agitated White House could endanger all of his spacefaring aspirations.ALSO READ | Speak now, or be forever damnedStarting a war of words with Trump might make some supporters feel good, but at what cost? Would harsh words help refugees? Unlikely. Musk, after all, has proven that hes not particularly good at politics. Musk said on Twitter that he disagrees with the immigration orders, he called them bad, but he was relentlessly diplomatic. His messages on Twitter, and the responses, continued Monday. Musks response: The Make-America-Great vibe here probably wont win back any of the Twitter users calling for a Tesla boycott.

				Amazons chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky said in a conference call with analysts on Thursday that the e-commerce giant was encouraged by its progress in India and the response it has received from consumers. He acknowledged that the investment in India continues to be  large.What you are seeing is the continuation of the step-up investment that we saw in the second half of last year...We also have investments in other Prime benefits from Prime Now to AmazonFresh and of course we are continuing to invest in Alexa and our Echo devices. And finally, I guess, Id point out India which continues to be a rather large investment for us, said Olsavsky. In the three months ended December, Amazon posted international sales of about $14 billion, and its loss widened to $487 million from $108 million a year ago, mainly due to the online marketplaces investments in India. Amazon posted an operating loss of about $541 million from its international business in the September quarter. Amazon has committed to investing at least $5 billion in India over the next few years. According to recent regulatory filings, Amazon has so far invested over Rs7,000 crore (a little over $1 billion) into its Indian operations, with a recent capital infusion of about Rs2,000 crore.Its still very early (in India). We continue to say that, but we are very encouraged with what weve created with customers and sellers alike in India over the last few years.... We will continue to build our business there and continue to do a great job for both customers and sellers. Were bullish on India longer-term and its early, said Olsavsky. Interestingly, Amazon also said that it had not witnessed any major impact on sales due to the November invalidation of high-value currency notes by the Indian government. Demonetization had an impact on all online retailers in the weeks following the move and caused a widespread slowdown in online shopping, as the cash ban put off consumers in a country where a majority of shoppers still use cash for day-to-day transactions.Experts tracking Amazons ambitious moves in India said that while Amazon is currently losing money due to heavy investments in India, the Seattle-based e-commerce based giant is looking at the long-term potential of the market and would not mind spending a few extra billions of dollars to conquer an important Internet market like India. See, Amazon knows that theyve got into a 10-15-year play with India, at the very least. For (Amazon founder) Jeff Bezos, this is a bit of an ego battlesince he lost out big-time in China, he feels he cant afford to have a repeat of that in India and so, hes prepared to do whatever it takes to conquer India, said Rutvik Doshi, director at the India arm of Inventus Capital Partners.For Amazon, in the long run of a 20-year horizon, $10-15 billion of investment is nothingfor a company that has a market cap of $350-400 billion, thats just a drop in the ocean, he added.In a separate development, Amazon has sought Indian government approval for online retailing of food products produced and manufactured in India, proposing to invest about Rs3,400 crore, PTI reported, citing people it didnt identify.

				A key reason why these companies were able to perform better is the fact that they reported a better gross refining margin (GRM).For the quarter, the measure for IOC, HPCL and BPCL stood at $9.98 a barrel, $6.83 a barrel and $6.09 a barrel, respectively.GRM is a measure of profitability for refining companies. In general, GRMs of refining companies were expected to get a boost from inventory gains, thanks to the rising oil price trend over the quarter. That has panned out. Spark Capital Advisors (India) Pvt. Ltd says, adjusted for refining inventory gains, the GRMs for these companies were in the range of $4-5 a barrel. Thats not very impressive.Nevertheless, the results beat street expectations.IOCs operating profit increased by one-third, compared with the same period last year to Rs.13,683 crore. HPCLs operating profit increased 17% year-on-year to Rs.3,627 crore, while BPCLs operating profit increased at a much slower pace of 3% to Rs.3,919 crore.Reported net profit of IOC, HPCL and BPCL increased 25%, 30% and 11%, respectively, to Rs.8,269 crore, Rs.2,098 crore and Rs.2,620 crore.What next after a great quarter? Investors in these stocks have little to complain. Higher visibility on profits thanks to reforms in the sector, benefits from lower crude price and robust demand have helped sentiment. So far this year, shares of these companies have outperformed the Sensex meaningfully. Currently, BPCL, HPCL and IOC trade at 11 times, nine times and 10 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year.Even as valuations do not appear demanding, the outlook isnt the brightest. Spark Capital believes OMCs earnings have peaked out in fiscal 2016 and sees risks to 2HFY17/FY18E earnings. Some factors that pose risks, according to the brokerage, include weaker GRMs and narrowing of trade discounts offered by West Asian suppliershitting GRMs and normalization in marketing margins of auto fuels.Further, while the June quarter was supported by strong inventory gains, a similar support in the current quarter is unlikely. In fact, it is possible that the June quarter ends up being the best quarter for this year. Given this and the sharp run-up in the stocks, upsides in the OMC stocks could be capped.",2016-09-04,vwgz8rEb7fUq3xkuRqZFXK,"While the June quarter was supported by strong inventory gains, a similar support in the current quarter is unlikely, according to some analysts",both,20:18,Inventory gains boost oil marketing companies in June quarter
0.55,"San Francisco: I built a chatbot. It can only do a handful of things, and its even dumber than the average chatbot. But it works, and I can talk to it through Facebook Messenger. More importantly, Im not a coder.
				   
				Some of the worlds largest technology companies are banking on a future where people will send text messages to airlines, banks, restaurants or stores and receive automated responses. Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corp., IBM and Tencent each held events this year centered around promoting their bot-related initiatives to software makers. Twitter Inc. introduced chatbot-like functions with Pizza Hut and other brands on Tuesday to field customer service inquiries.Many are betting these tools will soon be everywhere, with bot avatars for pop stars and mom-and-pop shops. (The band Kiss already has one.) For that bot-filled future to unfold, several startups are hoping to enable anyonenot just software developersto build a bot.The latest is Octane AI, which raised $1.5 million from General Catalyst and other investors. It joins Chatfuel, Olabot and Motion.ai, all of which have either raised money or rolled out their DIY-chatbot tools in the past year. They let people choose from a list of basic commands and edit scripted responses. Some generate revenue through subscriptions.The race among these startups heated up in April, when Facebook made chatbots available to Messengers billion-plus users. Facebook has said there are more than 30,000 chatbots available through its app. In September, Google bought Api.ai, a service that helps developers build bots.Making chatbots accessible to people who cant code is going to be a way a lot of businesses end up building their first few bots, said Phil Libin, a partner at General Catalyst. He compared these nascent bot-building tools with Squarespace Inc. or Wix.com Ltd., which make it easy to build a website.The chatbots you can create with these services are fairly rudimentary. If the bot sees a word or phrase it doesnt recognize or doesnt have an answer for, the conversation hits a dead end. To keep the chatter flowing, many chatbots act like an automated phone system: They nudge users to pick from a small set of responses, displayed as buttons. In most cases, you cant press 0 to get an operator.Its very important to set expectations, said Dmitry Dumik, whose company Chatfuel powers news-delivering chatbots for the New York Times and TechCrunch. You cant have a chatbot like in the movie Her.Octane co-founder Matt Schlicht is optimistic that bots will someday become more useful and benefit from advancements in artificial intelligence. When the iPhone first came out, we had things like the fart app, said Schlicht. Were in the fart app stage with bots.Schlichts startup is targeting brands with loyal followings for its chatbot builder. Octane recently teamed up with 50 Cent to answer messages sent to his Facebook page. The rappers bot can help fans do a few things, such as buying a G-Unit hat or signing up for updates from the musician. If you ask it a question it doesnt know how to answer, the bot simply replies: whats up fam.People message these Facebook pages all the time, and for the most part, no one responds, and the message goes into a black hole, said Schlicht. Its a huge missed opportunity.There are build-your-own chatbot tools that try to replicate dead people, and others that cater to the living. Olabot lets users create a bot version of themselves in minutes just by talking to it. The end result functions as a kind of social profile: Users can link their Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Medium and Spotify accounts, and then answer multiple-choice questions about their interests and views, such as, Would you rather talk about relationships or politics? The goal, according to Olabot CEO Esther Crawford: It should be as easy as creating an Instagram account. Bloomberg",2016-11-03,w1EyIubK0fuxqHzMXKumKP,Some of the worlds largest technology companies are betting on a chatbot future.

1.0,"Have you seen sci-fi movies like A.I. Artificial Intelligence, a 2001 US science fiction drama directed by Steven Spielberg that portrays a childlike android programmed to love, or Bicentennial Man, which starred the late Robin Williams and was based on a 1976 novel by Isaac Asimov? Have you seen the movie Surrogates which starred Bruce Willis and portrayed a futuristic world where people live within the safety of their homes while their robotic surrogates carry on their daily chores?
				   
				If yes, you are also likely to believe that machines endowed with artificial intelligence (AI) can emulate, or even surpass, human intelligence. However, nothing can be further from the truth, say researchers. At least not till date.The frightening, futurist portrayals of artificial intelligence that dominate films and novels, and shape the popular imagination, are fictional Unlike in the movies, there is no race of superhuman robots on the horizon or probably even possible, insists a Stanford University-hosted report. Titled Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030, this year-long investigation is the first of a series of reports to be published at regular intervals as part of a 100-year study on AI. While the rate of progress in AI has been patchy and unpredictable, there have been significant advances since the fields inception 60 years ago In reality, AI is already changing our daily lives, almost entirely in ways that improve human health, safety, and productivity, the report added.AI has undoubtedly risen like a phoenix from the ashes of the so-called AI wintera period of time in the late 1970s and early 1980s when funding dwindled and research almost went underground. Peter Stone, a computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin and chair of the 17-member panel of international experts who wrote the Stanford report, says he and the panel believe that specialized AI applications will become both increasingly common and more useful by 2030, improving our economy and quality of life... But this technology will also create profound challenges, affecting jobs and incomes and other issues that we should begin addressing now to ensure that the benefits of AI are broadly shared.The Stanford report traces its roots to a 2009 study that brought AI scientists in a process of introspection that became ongoing in 2014, when Eric and Mary Horvitz created the AI100 endowment through Stanford. It investigates eight domains (see more at the end of this article) of human activity in which AI technologies are beginning to affect urban life in ways that will become increasingly pervasive and profound by 2030.Computer vision and AI planning, for example, drive the video games that are now a bigger entertainment industry than Hollywood, notes the report. Deep learning, a form of machine learning based on layered representations of variables referred to as neural networks, has made speech-understanding practical on our phones and in our kitchens, and its algorithms can be applied widely to an array of apps that rely on pattern recognition. Natural language processing, and knowledge representation and reasoning, according to the report, have enabled a machine to beat the Jeopardy champion and are bringing new power to Web searches.While impressive, these technologies are highly tailored to particular tasks. Each application typically requires years of specialized research and careful, unique construction. In similarly targeted apps, substantial increases in the future uses of AI technologies including more self-driving cars, healthcare diagnostics and targeted treatments, and physical assistance for care of elders can be expected.But what exactly is AI?Curiously, the lack of a precise, universally accepted definition of AI probably has helped the field to grow, blossom, and advance at an ever-accelerating pace, says the Stanford report.According to the study panel, Nils J. Nilsson has provided a useful definition: Artificial intelligence is that activity devoted to making machines intelligent, and intelligence is that quality that enables an entity to function appropriately and with foresight in its environment. Nilsson is Kumagai professor of engineering (emeritus) in the department of computer science at Stanford University and one of the founding researchers in the discipline of AI. The late John McCarthy, an American computer and cognitive scientist who coined the term AI in 1955, defined it as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.AI adopts an interdisciplinary approach. Other than computer science, AI also relies on subjects like math, psychology, linguistics, philosophy and neuroscience. Its growth has been triggered by the maturation of machine learning, stimulated in part by the rise of the digital economy, which both provides and leverages large amounts of data, according to the Stanford report. Other factors include the rise of cloud computing resources and consumer demand for widespread access to services such as speech recognition and navigation support.Machine learning has been propelled dramatically forward by impressive empirical successes of artificial neural networks, which can now be trained with huge data sets and large-scale computing. This approach has been come to be known as deep learning. The leap in the performance of information processing algorithms has been accompanied by significant progress in hardware technology for basic operations such as sensing, perception, and object recognition. New platforms and longer term, AI may be thought of as a radically different mechanism for wealth creation in which everyone should be entitled to a portion of the worlds AI-produced treasures, says the report.AI experts predict that intelligent and semi-intelligent autonomous systems such as self-driving cars and autonomous drones will march into our society in the next two-three years, according to a 6 February briefing at the 2016 American Association for the Advancement of Science Annual Meeting.To be sure, major research universities devote departments to AI studies, and technology companies already spend heavily to explore AI applications they regard as critical to their futures.On 28 September, for instance, Google Inc.-owned DeepMind Technologies Ltd, Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corp. and IBM Corp. said they will create a non-profit organization that will work to advance public understanding of AI technologies and formulate best practices on the challenges and opportunities within the field. Academics, non-profits, and specialists in policy and ethics will be invited to join the board of the organization, named the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society (Partnership on AI).The objective of the Partnership on AI is to address opportunities and challenges with AI technologies to benefit people and society. Besides conducting research, recommending best practices, and publishing research under an open licence in areas such as ethics, fairness and inclusivity; transparency, privacy and interoperability; collaboration between people and AI systems; and the trustworthiness, reliability and robustness of the technology, the organizations founding members will each contribute financial and research resources to the partnership and will share leadership with independent third-parties, including academics, user group advocates, and industry domain experts.On 29 September, Microsoft announced the formation of a new Microsoft AI and Research Group, bringing together over 5,000 computer scientists and engineers focused on the companys AI product efforts. The new group will be led by computer vision expert Harry Shum, a 20-year Microsoft veteran whose career has spanned leadership roles across Microsoft Research and Bing engineering. Several of Microsofts engineering leaders and teams will join the newly formed group, including those from the Information Platform, Cortana and Bing, and Ambient Computing and Robotics units. Effectively, the Microsoft AI and Research Group will encompass AI product engineering, basic and applied research labs, and New Experiences and Technologies.According to Satya Nadella, chief executive of Microsoft, this newly formed unit will help Microsoft focus on empowering both people and organizations, by democratizing access to intelligence to help solve our most pressing challenges, for which we are infusing AI into everything we deliver across our computing platforms and experiences.Microsoft is adopting a four-pronged approach to its initiative to democratize AI. The first involves harnessing AI to fundamentally change human and computer interaction through agents such as Microsofts digital personal assistant Cortana. The second is about infusing every appfrom the photo app on peoples phones to Skype and Office 365with intelligence.The third focuses on making these intelligent capabilities that are infused in Microsofts appscognitive capabilities such as vision and speech, and machine analyticsavailable to every app developer in the world. The fourth strategy revolves around building the worlds most powerful AI supercomputer with Azure and making it available to anyone, to enable people and organizations to harness its power.Facebook AI Research, according to a November 2015 note by Mike Schroepfer, chief technology officer at the social network firm, has been conducting ambitious research in areas like image recognition and natural language understanding with developments in a new technology called Memory Networks that add a type of short-term memory to the convolutional neural networks that power the deep-learning systems, allowing those systems to understand language more like a human would.In March,  DeepMinds computer programme, AlphaGo, beat Go champion Lee Seedol once again, triggering a deep-seated fear about the prowess of AI-driven bots. On the flip side, Microsofts AI chatbot Tay turned racist and sexist within 24 hours, forcing the company to issue an apology and take Tay offline. Microsoft, though, does have a chatbot called XiaoIce in China, which it claims is being used by about 40 million people.On 6 October, Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd announced it has agreed to acquire Viv Labs Inc., which has developed an AI platform that gives third-party developers the power to use and build conversational assistants and integrate a natural language-based interface into renowned apps and services. The deal underscores the companys penchant for virtual personal assistants and is part of its broader vision to deliver an AI-based open ecosystem across all its devices and services.Will AI machines surpass us?Such developments do give the impression that machines will soon become more intelligent than us. But we are not beaten yethuman skills are still superior in some areas, concludes a recent study by Danish physicist Jacob Sherson, published in science journal Nature. Sherson and his research group at Aarhus University, according to a 13 April statement, have identified one of the abilities that still makes humans unique compared to a computers enormous processing powerour skill in approaching problems heuristically and solving them intuitively.Technology luminaries such as Bill Gates, Elon Musk, even physicist Stephen Hawking, have expressed fear that robots with AI could rule mankind. But there are those who believe that AI machines can be controlled. Marvin Lee Minsky, who died in January, was an American cognitive scientist in the field of AI and co-founder of MITs AI laboratory. A champion of AI, he did believe that some computers would eventually become more intelligent than most human beings, but hoped that researchers would make such computers benevolent to mankind.On the other hand, Raymond Ray Kurzweil, an American author, computer scientist, inventor and futurist, in his 2006 book The Singularity is Near, predicted, among many other things, that AI will surpass humans, the smartest and most capable life forms on the planet. By 2099, he forecast that machines would have attained equal legal status with humans. However, Ray has sought to allay such fears that smart machines will dominate humans by pointing out that we can deploy strategies to keep emerging technologies like AI safe, and underscoring the existence of ethical guidelines like Isaac Asimovs three laws for robots, which can prevent at least to some extent smart machines from overpowering us (Should we fear AI?).So will these intelligent machines rule over humans?The answer to this question, however, is not easy because much will depend on how you approach, or address, the issue. The Stanford report concludes: Over the next several years, AI research, systems development, and social and regulatory frameworks will shape how the benefits of AI are weighed against its costs and risks, and how broadly these benefits are spread.What the Stanford AI report saysAutonomous cars, trucks and, possibly, aerial delivery vehicles may alter how we commute, work and shop, and create new patterns of life and leisure in cities.Home/service robots like robotic vacuum cleaners already in some homes and specialized robots will clean and provide security in living/work spaces. They will be equipped with sensors and remote controls.Healthcare devices to monitor personal health and robot-assisted surgery are hints of things to come if AI is developed in ways that gain the trust of doctors, nurses, patients and regulators.Interactive tutoring systems already help students learn languages, math and other skills. More is possible if technologies like natural language processing platforms develop to augment instruction by humans.The conjunction of content creation tools, social networks and AI will lead to new ways to gather, organize and deliver media in engaging, personalized and interactive ways.Investments in uplifting technologies like predictive models to prevent lead poisoning or improve food distribution could spread AI benefits to the underserved.Cameras, drones and software to analyse crime patterns should use AI in ways that reduce human bias and enhance safety without loss of liberty or dignity.Work should start now on how to help people adapt as the economy undergoes rapid changes as many existing jobs are lost and new ones are created.Source: Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030",2016-11-02,w2pku8z1u69nY9mVRp6rUM,Your fortnightly guide to how cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence will shape lives and businesses,company,01:29,"Artificial Intelligence is coming of age, slowly but surely"
0.17,"New Delhi: Putting speculation to rest, filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali joined hands with Viacom18 Motion Pictures for his epic project Padmavati in October. Scheduled for a 17 November, 2017 release, the estimated budget of the Ranveer Singh, Shahid Kapoor and Deepika Padukone-starrer is around Rs180 crore, making it one of Indias most expensive movie productions, said trade experts who declined to be named. About Rs150 crore has been set aside for production and the remaining for promotions, advertising and other expenses.
				   
				Media reports in the past two months suggested that the film would mark the unique collaboration of two major Bollywood corporate housesEros International that had backed the previous two films directed by Bhansali, Bajirao Mastani and Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela, and Viacom with which he had co-produced Mary Kom and Gabbar Is Back. But Eros backed out of the deal in October, industry experts say, because of a financial crunch. Eros International Plc.s stock has fallen since August this year. Its shares, as of Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, reads last traded at $18.13 apiece, down from $19.23 apiece on 8 August . Bombay Stock Exchange listed Eros International Media Ltd stock witnessed a sharper fall in the same period, falling to Rs176.90 on Friday from Rs230 apiece on 8 August. Padmavati is the second film that Eros has let go of recently; it earlier backed out of Ajay Devgn-starrer Shivaay, which also had a budget of over Rs100 crore. The studio declined to comment for this story.The deal makes sense for Viacom despite the massive budget, say trade experts. For one, it involves Bhansali, who is riding high on the Rs184 crore net box office collections of Bajirao Mastani. A director is always assured a budget equal to the recovery that his last film made. The challenge is to go beyond that and there is always about 10-20% risk for the studio involved, said Jayantilal Gada, chairman of film-producing and presenting company Pen India. Plus with him (Bhansali), its a case of take it or leave it. Look at any of his films and you can see the money spent on every scene, they are all meant to be big screen experiences.To be sure though, in absolute terms, Padmavati will have to equal the Rs500 crore plus gross collections of war epic Baahubali: The Beginning to recover the investment, said Atul Mohan, editor of trade magazine Complete Cinema, given obstacles like rising ticket prices and rampant piracy in the movie business.He is a very sensible director and you definitely need these larger-than-life films once in a while to provide variety for audiences. But the Indian box office is highly unpredictable and a big-budget film gone wrong can totally break a studio as the examples of Mohenjo Daro and Bombay Velvet show, Mohan said. Viacom shelled out about Rs40 crore for the satellite rights of Bhansalis Bajirao Mastani. The Rs150 crore production budget for Padmavati means that Viacom will spend about Rs75 crore from its own funds and the remaining will come as loans from banks. A mere Rs35 crore extra would give them rights to a Bhansali film that would, as most people agree, stand a class apart. Plus there are a variety of revenue streams available for Viacom to recover its investment in Padmavati.Earlier films were dependent on theatrical, music and satellite rights for earnings. Now there is such a huge revenue proposition in the form of digital apps, every mobile is a shop now, said Sanjay Bhandari, a financial adviser to the film industry.Viacom especially stands to benefit thanks to its video-on-demand service Voot, a joint venture with Reliance Industries Ltd, which in September launched its telecom operation. The studio remained unavailable for comment.Producers arent just looking at recovery on the table now, at least 30-40% of the recovery happens after the release. The lifespan of movies has gone up tremendously and I see this as a reasonable deal, Bhandari said.",2016-11-11,w5SiHLkpSzefzhtC0e2nuJ,The Rs150 crore production budget for Padmavati means that Viacom will spend about Rs75 crore from its own funds and the remaining will come as loans from banks,both,19:42,Why the Rs 180 crore Padmavati deal may work for Viacom

HCL had earlier this year appointed Vijayakumar as chief operating officer, signalling a transition at Indias fourth-largest information technology firm where growth has slowed in the past few quarters. 
				   
				Vijayakumars challenge will be to bring HCL back on the growth path and fill the void left by former CEO Anant Gupta. Edited excerpts from an interview:What will be your focus area as the new CEO?One very important thing that we have articulated to the market is our Mode 123 strategy. This is all about how we can map the customer spend and fine-tune our services to make it relevant to the spend. We have mode 1 services which are traditional services such as infrastructure, application, engineering services and BPO (business process outsourcing). These are momentum services and we believe these markets are still under-served. Only 49% of global 2,000 companies have outsourced. Then still there are a lot of re-bid opportunities, $150 billion worth of re-bid is on and year on year its $40-50 billion. Its a big opportunity.You have made niche acquisitions such as those of Volvo for automotive and Butler America for aerospace. Are you more focused on gaining technology instead of acquiring customers?We want to focus on intellectual property (IP). If you want to future-proof your business, I think products and IPs are very important, so whether you can overnight build products and IPs of very high valueno. By this partnership and niche acquisitions, we will start building it in the long term. I think its really a very important strategy for us.Are you planning to appoint a new head of the infrastructure business, and will the COO position be filled?Its something I have to think about. Its too early. But we have a very strong leadershipsales leaders, delivery leaders and HCL has always boasted of strong leadership pipeline. I think, I am pretty comfortable with the momentum and we are pretty optimistic for the overall outlook.So, can I say that the COO position was created to help you transition to the CEO post?You can take it like that. It was a part of succession planning.You have chalked out a partnership with IBM. What gains are you expecting from this, considering that IBM is also a competitor?Competition is in certain space. In the IT space, there are lots of opportunities. They have a huge software business. So, there are good IPs that can be potentially looked at and thats what we have done. And then they are also a very large PaaS (platform-as-a-service) provider, like Bluemix is a big PaaS service. Some of our modern applications can be built on Microsoft Azure or IBM Bluemix.You have been defocusing on the India market. Will that continue?Yes, we are not focusing on the India market. It will continue to come down.With a 2.8% quarterly growth and a soft second half, will you be able to achieve the 12-14% target in 2016-17?We had a 6% revenue growth in the first quarter, we have 2.8% in the second quarter, so we are clear on what the run rate is. It is between 2% and 3% to get to the 12-14%. So far, from whatever we know, we feel confident to achieve that target.While many IT peers have hired outsiders in order to transform themselves, you are a 22-year company veteran. Do you feel confident to bring new ideas?Each core business has got very strong leadership. We continue to hire from outside also. So, it gives a good mix of external and internal view.

-0.25,"Mumbai:  The Tata group fracas appears to have shed all earthly inhibitions and gone to a galaxy far, far away. In this Star Wars space opera, Cyrus Mistry, the recently ousted chairman, was Sith Lord Darth Vader who had brainwashed the PR folk  the old and venerable conglomerates noble Jedi warriors  and used them to smother criticism of his performance.
				   
				Thats probably why a 24 September Economist report, titled Mistrys Elephant, which was denounced by the group for drawing preconceived conclusions based on an inappropriate interpretation of selected data, was on Thursday extolled by the same people for being really a well-balanced and critical review.Not just that. Thursdays press statement ticked off the groups PR machineryin other words, itselffor dismissing views that did not toe the line being peddled by Bombay House, Tatas headquarters.

Odd given PR side is/was https://t.co/gCbxA6z7EB Twitter: Stanley Pignal on TwitterAs for investors who have seen more than $12 billion of their Tata group wealth vanish since 24 October, the day Ratan Tata reclaimed control, only three questions really matter:Whos the Chosen One to restore balance to the Force? How many episodes are left? Wheres the popcorn?The answer to the first is far from obvious. Ratan Tatas camp is now accusing Mistry of trying to hijack control of operating companies in the $100 billion salt-to-software conglomerate. Mistrys side says the allegations are untrue. Tata is mocking Mistrys poor leadership for botching up Tata Steel Ltds UK operations, claiming that the Scunthorpe steel plant it sold in May to Greybull Capital LLP for 1 British pound has since seen a dramatic turnaround. Mistry, on the other hand, blames Ratan Tatas $12.9 billion purchase of Corus Group Plcs steel assets in 2007 for the groups debt overhang.Tata Consultancy share-price declined 13% since Ratan returned . Since Ratan Tata is back only in an interim capacity, the group needs a new chairman to end the spat. But until Mistry agrees to sell his familys 18.4% holding in Tata Sons Ltd., the holding company, the lightsabers wont get turned off. Its unlikely that the CEO of a global corporation would want to jump into the fray as Luke Skywalkerand get his or her reputation fried in the process. Besides, after Tata Groups press statement accused Mistry of dismantling structures put in place by visionary founders and generations of Tatas, its not even clear if the group wants to be anything other than a family-run enterprise.Its a much more than just a war of words. Ratan Tata is trying to evict Mistry from the boards of operating companies, but its proving to be far from easy thanks to a few independent directors whore supporting Mistry. But are those directors taking up the cudgels to uphold corporate governance standards, or are they simply trying to avoid the embarrassment of firing a chairman after showering praises on him?Like in everything else with the Tata Wars, its impossible to establish whos with the Force and whos gone over to the Dark Side. Or for that matter, how many more episodes are left in the sordid saga. The best investors can hope for is that until the group makes up its mind on whether it wants to slash debt, gun for growth, or do a bit of both, Tata Consultancy Services , the groups ATM, will keep coughing up more cash so Bombay House can fully engage in the tussle for control.

The state-owned bank is also offering a waiver on processing fees on home loans for customers who want to buy SBI approved projects and are applying online, those who want to transfer their home loans to the bank, and certain government employees.The housing finance market is currently dominated by SBI, which had a home loan portfolio worth Rs1.97 trillion, as on 30 June. In comparison, ICICI Bank had a home loan portfolio worth Rs1.13 trillion at the end of the first quarter.ALSO READ | Banks cut lending and deposit ratesAccording to Sumit Bali, senior executive vice-president and head-personal assets at Kotak Mahindra Bank, lenders have been passing on the benefit of falling interest rates in the system to their retail and small and medium enterprises (SME) customers over the last few months and the festive season should see more such offers coming up.Between August and September, Kotak Mahindra Bank ran a special monsoon offer where it waived processing fees for home loan customers who were also given an interest rate of 9.35% on their new loans. According to Bali, the bank may look at reintroducing these offers, depending on market conditions. Our six-month MCLR, which is the basic rate on which we price our home loans, is at about 9.2%. Presently, we are charging a premium of about 5 bps and we can reduce it to nil, depending on the customer profile. We wouldnt want to lose our customers over a 5-10 bps difference, he added.As experts see it, lenders will be using festive season demand as a means to prop up their lending portfolios which have been growing slowly over the most of this financial year. As of now, lenders are being quite selective in announcing festive offers. As corporate loan growth has been lagging for many quarters now, home finance seems to be the safest growth option for banks. Whether these rate reductions would go beyond the festive season, will determine if we are in a rate war- type situation, said Karthik Srinivasan, senior vice-president and co-head of financial sector ratings firm Icra Ltd.According to fortnightly data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), as on 14 October, the outstanding non-food credit for the banking system was reported at Rs72.7 trillion, showing only a 9% year-on-year growth.In comparison, home loans have been showing a growth of at least 18-20% year-on-year for the past many months and stood at over Rs8 trillion at the end of September, RBI data shows. Indias largest mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) Ltd, too announced it would reduce its lending rates by 15 bps, with effect from 4 November.Over the past couple of months, we have seen a drop in our marginal costs of funds and as always HDFC has ensured that benefit is passed on to its customers, said HDFC managing director Renu Sud Karnad. As of 30 September, HDFCs overall loan portfolio was reported at Rs2.75 trillion, up 17% year-on-year.

-0.09,"Washington/San Francisco:  Apple Inc. sued Qualcomm Inc., accusing it of monopolizing the market for chips for wireless devices and withholding $1 billion in retaliation for cooperating with South Korean antitrust authorities.
				   
				Apple is demanding Qualcomm hand over money that was supposed to be a rebate for licensing fees. Qualcomm is holding back the money as punishment for Apple cooperating with Korean antitrust regulators, according to the complaint filed in San Diego, where Qualcomm is based.Apple also wants back some of the billions of dollars it claims it was overcharged in Qualcomms illegal scheme to control the market for mobile phone chips. It wants a court to change how Qualcomm charges for its technology in the future.Qualcomm, the largest maker of mobile phone chips, has been under fire by regulators around the world for its patent licensing practices. The lawsuit filed on Friday is the first direct challenge by one of its biggest customers and threatens to upend how royalties are calculated by any owner of a patent on technology that underlies modern electronics.Apple is facing pressure to squeeze more profit out of every iPhone after revenue declined last year for the first time since 2001, dragged down by lower handset sales. It typically sources the same component from several suppliers, which helps secure lower prices by forcing the manufacturers to compete on price.Qualcomm fell 2.4% to $63 at the close in New York. Apple rose less than 1% to $120.It is quite clear that Apples claims are baseless, Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement. Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing program.Also Read: Apple is ready to start making iPhones in India, but at a priceQualcomm also accused Apple of encouraging regulators to attack Qualcomm in various jurisdictions around the world, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information.Legacy standardsQualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties, Apple said in a statement. Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined.The complaint also challenges the validity of some key Qualcomm patents for wireless technologies. Apple asks the court to rule that, if the patents are upheld, that the royalty amount is significantly lower than what Qualcomm charges now.In December, South Korea, home to two of Qualcomms largest customers, fined the company 1.03 trillion won ($890 million) and described its practices as monopolistic. Qualcomm has said it will appeal the decision.Antitrust investigationsUnder the agreement with Qualcomm, Apple said it was forced to refrain from taking any steps to challenge Qualcomms business model.Apple complied with investigation demands from Korean regulators, an action Qualcomm claimed was in violation of the agreement. In retaliation, Qualcomm withheld money that it was due to pay Apple in royalty rebates, the iPhone maker said.Qualcomm offered to pay the money if Apple retracted and corrected its statements to government agencies, according to the complaint.South Korean regulators arent the only authorities investigating Qualcomm.Patent royaltiesThe US Federal Trade Commission on 17 January filed its own antitrust suit against Qualcomm. The chipmaker is also being investigated by the European Union and Taiwanese authorities.At the heart of the dispute between Apple and Qualcomm is a push by phone makers with the support of regulators to reduce the patent royalties Qualcomm charges.Qualcomm gets the bulk of its revenue from selling chips, but more than half of its profit from the separate licensing business. Its patents cover the fundamentals of cellular technology, allowing it to rake in billions in licensing fees. In other words, the chipmaker gets paid regardless of whether its chips are used in mobile phones or not.One common thread in all of the cases is the contention that royalty rates should be calculated as a percentage of the price of the components in the phone that Qualcomm invents and sells  measured in tens of dollars. Currently licensing is a percentage of the price of the entire phone, which is usually in the hundreds of dollars.Companies collaborate to develop industry standards so that the devices can communicate with each other. Since they have the ability to ensure their inventions get included in the standards, they pledge to license on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.Qualcomm has breached that pledge by refusing to license its patents to Intel Corp., a rival chipmaker thats been providing some chips to Apple for the past year, according to the complaint.Bullying accusationsApple accused Qualcomm of bullying it, threatening to withhold chip supply, forcing it to agree not to challenge Qualcomms patents and using Apple innovations to help its competitors. Much of the money Qualcomm collects on the iPhone or iPad is paid by third-party manufacturers who pass along the cost, according to the complaint. Apple said Qualcomm can demand higher royalties because those manufacturers have no incentive to negotiate.Apple said its not allowed to see those agreements, and believes Qualcomm gets paid multiple times on the same device. Since Qualcomm wont give Apple a direct license, it instead agreed to give Apple a rebate  money that its now withholding.The case is Apple Inc. v. Qualcomm Inc., 17-108, US District Court for the Southern District of California (San Diego).

-0.95,"Mumbai: Indias withdrawal of larger banknotes from circulation is sparking a surge in cash deposits and raising hopes the added liquidity will allow banks to lower lending rates more aggressively.
				   
				Lower lending rates have long been seen as a needed boost to Indias economy, which grew at a 15-month low in the April-June quarter, in part due to a dearth of corporate investment.Tuesdays withdrawal of Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes, aimed at curbing corruption and counterfeit currency, has sparked long lines of people looking to exchange their worthless notes.State Bank of India (SBI), Indias largest lender by assets, said on Friday it had already received Rs18,000 crore ($2.68 billion) in savings and current account deposits since Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the measure.Also Read: Why are ATMs still out of service and out of cash ?Economists at SBI estimate banks will receive an influx of Rs5,07,000 crore in cash, of which 10% is likely to be left at lenders. That type of influx could allow banks to lower their deposit rates, and in turn, their lending ratesproviding a vital deployment of credit.What I do in a month, Ive done in a day, said SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya, regarding the influx of low-cost deposits. Surely the cost of funds is something that is going to ease, she said, adding the bank believed that would result in a fall in lending rates.Banking shares have surged, with SBI up 11.3% in the two days after the announcement, although it fell 3% on Friday.Also Read: Rs500, Rs1000 note ban: Tax evaders engaging in illegal transactions on I-T dept radarMuch will depend on how many deposits end up actually coming in, but there is room for hope.

0.22,"Bengaluru: Wipro Ltd will spend $500 million to buy Appirio Inc., an Indianapolis, US-based cloud services firm, underlining the aggressive acquisition-based strategy Indias third largest software services firm has scripted for its transformation.
				   
				Appirio helps companies move applications to hosted servers offered by Amazon, Google and Salesforce.com.The privately held company, founded in 2006, has raised more than $110 million from investors including Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic, and counts Facebook, Home Depot and IBM as its clients. It is estimated to have revenue of more than $200 million.Wipro chief executive officer Abidali Z. Neemuchwala said it is important for companies to transform the way they engage with customers and employees by leveraging the power of the cloud. Since Neemuchwala joined the company in April last year, Wipro has spent $1.13 billion to buy four companies, including Appirio.Wipro spent $95 million in July 2015 to buy Denmark-based design firm Designit, with a revenue of $30 million, to give a boost to its newly created business division, Wipro Digital.In December, it paid $78 million to buy Cellent, a German technology company with over $90 million in revenue, that implements and maintains SAP software for clients in automobile and manufacturing segments. In February, Wipro paid $460 million to buy HealthPlan Services, a Florida, US-based technology firm that brings over $220 million in business by offering solutions to health insurance firms. Wipro also tried buying Viteos Group but later called off the buyout, citing inordinate delays in the completion of the acquisition. The Times of India first reported the Appirio deal.Wipros decision to buy Appirio mirrors the approach followed by its larger peers Accenture Plc. and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM). Accenture bought Salesforce partner, Cloud Sherpas in September last year while IBM bought Salesforce partner Bluewolf Group in April this year.This deal is about giving Wipro the capabilities to scale out IT services in the cloud world. What it gains are some strong methodologies in delivering in the cloud, and  significant partnerships such as Workday, Salesforce, Amazon, and Google, said Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm.More importantly, Wipro can take those methodologies and scale out to adjust for building revenue in the cloud.

0.13,"Adversity brings out the best or the worst in people. The downturn in Indias start-up funding market over the past 12 months brought out the worst in the founders of some of the countrys most valuable start-ups. 
				   
				Strapped for capital and under assault from foreign competitors with deep pockets, such founders came down to playing the nationalist card and seeking the governments help in keeping non-Indian players out of the market.For Indias venture capital industry, on the other hand, the downturn has been a time to introspect, salvage, consolidate and rebuild.We look at some of the highs and lows that marked the countrys venture capital market in the past 12 months.1. The year started in the shadow of the first serious downturn that this market has seen in the decade since venture capital re-established its roots here as an asset class. Hedge funds, which fanned a valuation bubble in the start-up funding market for nearly two years, had fled late last year, leaving behind a yawning gap in the late-stage funding market. Hedge funds may have deserted the start-up market but global limited partners, institutional investors who back venture capital funds, stayed committed, in fact, upped their commitments. Two of the countrys biggest ever venture capital funds were raised in the last 12 months. In February, Sequoia Capital India, the countrys largest venture capital firm, raised a massive $920 million fund, dwarfing even some of the big private equity funds raised here lately. Last month, Accel Partners India closed commitments for a $450 million fund, only the second fund of that size since the one raised by Nexus Venture Partners in December last year. Limited partner commitments have also flowed into smaller funds. In May, Bengaluru-based Saama Capital raised a $31 million third fund. In October, Mumbai-based Blume Ventures closed $60 million in commitments for its second fund. By London-based researcher Preqins estimates, as of September, Indias venture capital industry was sitting on dry powder, or uninvested capital, worth more than $3 billion.2. Limited partners, however, remain concerned about poor returns on their past investments. In a bid to alleviate those concerns, fund managers at venture capital firms went into overdrive to shore up exits. The numbers for the closing quarter of 2016 are yet to come in. However, in the nine months of the year ended September, venture capital firms closed 54 exit deals worth $1.41 billion, exceeding the 43 exit deals worth 1.39 billion closed in all of 2015, according to data compiled by Chennai-based researcher Venture Intelligence.The exit run isnt yet as robust as both limited partners and fund managers would like, but a handful of deals set this year apart. In July, online travel services company Yatra delivered a partial exit to its investors, Norwest Venture Partners, TV18 Group and Valiant Capital, when it struck a reverse merger with Nasdaq-listed special purpose acquisition company Terrapin 3 Acquisition Corp. The deal involved an $80 million cash payout to Yatras investors. Yatra debuted on Nasdaq this week following the completion of the merger. Another significant deal was the August acquisition of payments company Citrus Payments Solutions by South African internet conglomerate Naspers in a $130 million all-cash deal, a rare event in Indias venture capital market. The deal was a big payday for Sequoia Capital India, which had invested about $10 million over three funding rounds for a reported 32% stake. The offline retail sector served up a surprise big exitin August, private equity firm TA Associates bought an undisclosed stake in womenswear maker TCNS Clothing Co. for $140 million. Most of that went into buying Matrix Partners undisclosed stake in the company, earning the venture capital firm a 5x return on its original investment.3. Not all exits were happy events. As venture capital firms got to work consolidating their past investments, fire sales, write-offs and stock-swap deals were equally visible through the year. Things kicked off early with the much speculated January acquisition of property search and listings platform Commonfloor by online classifieds platform Quikr in a reported all-stock deal. The deal gave Commonfloors backers, Tiger Global Management, Accel Partners India and Google Capital, who collectively invested more than $60 million in the company, stakes in Quikr. In May, another troubled start-up, TinyOwl, was ushered into a stock-swap merger by its investors. The online food ordering service merged with hyperlocal delivery service Roadrunnr. The combined entity now operates as Runnr, with Sequoia Capital, Nexus Venture Partners, Matrix Partners and Blume Ventures as investors. The four venture capital firms had collectively pumped close to $40 million into the two companies prior to the merger.Rocket Internet, the Berlin-based start-up incubator and investor was involved in two deals that are widely believed to be distress sales. In April, it sold its online furniture store FabFurnish to Kishore Biyanis Future Group for an undisclosed sum and in July, online fashion store Jabong was picked up by e-commerce company Flipkart for just $70 million, a massive erosion from the $503 million Jabong was valued at in 2013. The other notable distress sale this year was Titans acquisition of a majority stake in jewellery e-tailer Caratlane for $53 million in May. The deal just about enabled Caratlanes backer Tiger Global to cover its reported investment of $52 million. By most accounts, the consolidation and cleaning out of portfolios is still well underway and will continue well into the next year. The portfolio to watch, though, will be New York-based hedge fund Tiger Globals 60-odd start-up investments here, including e-commerce bellwether Flipkart.4. The sticky issue of leadership transition in the venture capital industry found itself in the spotlight this year in the aftermath of a bitter spat in December last year within the investment team at Helion Venture Partners. Helion is one of Indias oldest home-grown venture capital firms and it came apart at the seams when its second line of partners, Alok Goyal, Rahul Chowdhri and Ritesh Banglani, quit the firm in a huff. The younger partners wanted more of a say in how the firm was run and a greater share of profits. The founding partners, Sanjeev Aggarwal, Rahul Chandra and Ashish Gupta, didnt share that view. The standoff exposed the fragile power equations that exist in what is still a fairly nascent industry. The incident served as a wake-up call to several other venture capital firms that have been around as long as Helion and will hopefully deter such ugly and public quarrels in future.5. Sometimes, even the ugliest fights have good outcomes. Helions Goyal, Chowdhri and Banglani have since started up on their own with Stellaris Venture Partners and are in the middle of raising their debut fund. Earlier this year, SAIF Partners principals Mukul Singhal and Rohit Jain broke away from the firm, amicably, to start their own seed investments-focused venture capital firm Pravega Ventures. Earlier, former Ventureast partners Sateesh Andra and Ramesh Byrapaneni struck out on their own to launch Endiya Partners, focused on seed and Series A investments, and raised initial commitments for their debut fund in January. When seasoned fund managers strike out on their own, especially in the midst of a downturn, it is the surest sign of a venture capital market that is maturing.Snigdha Sengupta is a consulting writer with Mint.

				Lenders such as State Bank of India (SBI) and Punjab National Bank (PNB) are exploring the idea of moving to a variable pay structure, which will be based on the performance of employees.SBI is looking to introduce an employee stock ownership plan and grading system based on an employees performance, said a senior SBI official on condition of anonymity. PNB plans to approach its board with a proposal to introduce performance-based pay for all officials above the level of chief manager.Today, an employees salary is predictable. There is a need to recognize performance and give remuneration. We have formed an internal committee of general managers to work on this matter and submit the proposal to the board, Usha Ananthasubramanian, managing director and chief executive officer of PNB, said at an analysts meeting, after the lenders earnings announcement.Usha also added that PNB had earlier tried to move to a variable pay structure for all employees under the chairmanship of K.C. Chakrabarty, but failed in its attempt.PNB ran up Rs1,967.16 crore in employee costs for the quarter to September, up from Rs1,877.56 crore a year ago. SBIs staff expenses rose to Rs6,257 crore from Rs5,906 crore in the same period.Banks are discussing moving to their own pay structures after the finance ministry asked them to start the process for the 11th bipartite wage pact before the current five-year settlement expires in October 2017.The ministry has asked banks to start early, instead of waiting for the culmination of the current wage pact, an official with the Indian Banks Association (IBA), which groups all banks in India, said on condition of anonymity.As large banks explore the idea of moving to their own pay structure, a few smaller ones including Union Bank, Syndicate Bank and Vijaya Bank have sent their consent to IBA to be a part of the process for negotiating a new wage agreement, added the official.The transition to a productivity-linked settlement is easier said than done. Such a move will face stiff resistance from bank employees unions, which are used to a uniform wage hike.We will oppose a variable pay structure if banks go ahead and introduce this system. We are for more efficiency and productivity, but we dont want differentiation in salary, said C.H, Venkatachalam, general secretary of the All India Bank Employees Association. Bank employees unions have, meanwhile, started preparing a charter of demands that will be submitted to IBA by January 2017.We are looking at an adequate hike in salary this time, in conformity with rising inflation. We are also looking at a higher starting salary for attracting new talent, special facilities for women and improvement in post-retirement benefits, said Venkatachalam.Around one million bank employees across public sector banks, old private sector and a few foreign banks are part of the industry-level wage settlement.According to the 10th bipartite wage settlement, banks and unions agreed to a 15% hike in wages, which resulted in an outgo of Rs5,000 crore for the system. Also agreed to were bank holidays on second and fourth Saturdays.Also, PSU banks have been reeling under losses and mounting NPAs and implementing the variable pay structure may be ill-timed. Concept of variable pay structure is sound.

				The question of how much Thakkar is worthhe says $541,000 while his wife claims his wealth is far greateris coming under scrutiny in a UK divorce court. A judge in the London family court has denied Thakkars request for a final divorce decree until a determination of his real worth.This is a case where the wife says her husband is a billionaire, judge Philip Moor said in the ruling that shows the difficulty courts have in making a fair assessment of wealth. All the assets are offshore. They are held in very complicated structures that have changed within the recent past. The situation is one where it can be very significant if you are a wife or a former wife.The judges ruling, which was handed down in June and published on the courts website last week, extends a legal battle over the less than five-year marriage that has cast a spotlight on the entrepreneur, whose own foundation has promoted him as Africas youngest billionaire.Financial puzzlesUK judges have become used to unpicking complex webs of offshore assets in high-stakes divorces as spouses sometimes plead net worth far less than what the other spouse claims is their actual fortune. The forensic tracing of assets is a problem that has played out in other scenarios judges have faced across the world from tax avoidance schemes to fraud prosecutions.Based on his disclosed public and closely held assets, Thakkars net worth is valued at $425 million, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His most valuable asset is Ison BPO (Business Process Outsourcing), a UAE-based outsourcing company that operates in Africa and India.Lawyers for Meera Thakkar declined to comment as did a spokesman for Ashish Thakkar. Thakkars lawyers didnt respond to a call seeking comment. In court filings, Thakkar has argued that the beneficiaries of his companies are his mother and sister.While the Thakkar case is at the London high court, similar issues have reached the countrys top court before. The ex-wife of oil trader Michael Prest won a Supreme Court ruling giving her the right to force offshore companies owned by her ex-husband to turn over assets as part of a 17.5 million-pound settlement in 2013. Prests lawyers argued at the time that the courts had no right to pierce the corporate veil of his companies to fund the settlement as they were separate entities and unrelated to the marriage.He was later threatened with up to four weeks in jail for failing to pay his ex-wife 360,000 pounds in 2015 despite his assets being estimated by the judge to be in the region of 37 million pounds.Allegations of hiding assets in divorce cases is nothing new and UK judges have wide discretion to set values as they see fit, according to Graham Coy, a lawyer at Stowe Family Law, who isnt involved in the Thakkar case.If someone is determined to try and hide their assets it is possible, but they could still end up being clobbered in the end anyway because a judge can just take a view on how much theyre worth and if they dont like it, prove it, Coy said.The ex-wife of a property magnate Scot Young told a London judge in one of the highest profile divorce cases in recent years that Young was hiding billions from her while he claimed he was about 28 million pounds in debt.The judge said in the 2013 ruling that Young wasnt a penniless man of straw with huge debts, and that hed hidden from the court about 40 million pounds in assets. Young fell to his death from a fourth-floor window of his flat in London in late 2014.The Supreme Court rolled back two divorce settlements in a 2015 decision that underlined Londons claim to be the divorce capital of the world. The top court ruled two ex-wives are entitled to larger divorce settlements because their husbands hid their true wealth, the decision could pave the way for previous divorce agreements to be revisited many years after they were agreed.Adventures in AfricaThakkars story began in Idi Amins Uganda. His family was among Asian families the dictator expelled in 1972, and moved to the UK, where Thakkar was born. They returned to Africa when he was a child, this time to Rwanda, where his family lost everything during the genocide in 1994, Thakkar says in his 2015 autobiography, The Lion Awakes: Adventures in Africas Economic Miracle.Thakkars own success has prompted him to be branded Africas youngest billionaire. Hes described that way in a 2013 video on a YouTube channel for his charity, the Mara Foundation. He is introduced as that at conferences and asked about it in media interviews.At 15, after the family had returned to Uganda, Thakkar sold a laptop to his dads friend, triggering the realization he could be a trader. His father gave him $5,000 start-up cash, and he started flying to Dubai to buy cheap computer products, which he sold from a tiny shop in central Kampala.He expanded his business by setting up a Dubai-based company. He later started a packaging factory in Uganda and partnered with an Indian Information Technology services company to help them gain entry in new markets across Africa, according to his websites.Thakkar and Diamond met at an event, hit it off and decided that they could start a banking venture together. Thakkar remains a non-executive director with Atlas Mara, which he and Diamond founded with the idea of buying up stakes in banks across sub-Saharan Africa. The company, domiciled in the British Virgin Islands, has raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors through share offerings since 2013.Its important to think big, dream big, but start small, Thakkar says in interviews and speeches. I dont want to bring Silicon Valley to Africa. I want to bring Africa to Silicon Valley. I think its important to be authentic, genuine, real. Bloomberg",2016-10-28,wmRGZq13ETIUlGFEZ4edJI,"Ashish Thakkar, co-founder of Atlas Mara Ltd , is having a prolonged divorce fight thanks to a complex web of offshore assets.

				The stock price of several non-banking financial companies have galloped. Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services Ltd (Mahindra Finance) has run-up 20%, outpacing the Sensex over the last six months. The rise hasnt abated even after the company posted a mixed set of numbers for the September quarter last week.Mahindra Finances disbursals grew 29% for the second quarter that led to an impressive 14% growth in assets under management (AUM), the fastest in four quarters for the company and this seems to have pleased its investors. Although the net profit took a beating and fell 35% from a year ago to Rs948 crore, it was forgiven after the management indicated better days lie ahead in terms of recovery. Indeed, given the cyclical nature of Mahindra Finances portfolio and that AUM growth was broad based, there is little reason to mistrust the managements outlook.But one look at the asset quality of the September quarter shows the picture is far from rosy. Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) grew by a massive 35% to form 11% of the loan book as of 30 September. The net NPA ratio rose to 5.4% indicating the company is not lucky in upgrades and recoveries too. In its interaction with analysts, Mahindra Finance said that credit costs would come down to 250-275 basis points for 2016-17 from around 300 basis points in the previous year as a bountiful monsoon translates into more cash with rural households and businesses. A basis point is 0.01%. Another thorn in the firms book is high operating costs. A stockpile of Rs4,748 crore of gross bad loans would keep provisions elevated and operating expenses too will stay high as Mahindra Finance is unlikely to slow down its expansion plans.The stock trades at a price to book value multiple of 3.4 of its FY16 earnings.

-0.94,"New Delhi: The quest for energy efficiency is transforming Indias Rs15,000 crore a year market for lighting systems. Conventional lamps are being replaced by efficient ones starting from simple LED (light emitting diode) bulbs to sophisticated movement-detecting lighting systems for smart cities and businesses, opening up a host of opportunities to lighting companies from the very bottom of the pyramid to high-end consumers. Harshavardhan Chitale, vice-chairman and managing director of Philips Lighting India Ltd, speaks to Mint about the industrys changing dynamics.
				   
				Edited excerpts from the interview:What is your strategy for growth in India?
We have actively contributed to improving the health of power distribution companies with energy savings. Lighting as a whole contributes to 18-20% of total power consumption in the country. To bridge our energy deficit, we need to either increase power generation or reduce the need for power itself, through energy efficiency. If the entire lighting system of the country is converted into efficient LED lighting or smart connected lighting, our total lighting-related power demand will get reduced by half. It frees up about 30 gigawatt (GW) of our over 300GW generation capacity. That more than bridges our peak power deficit, which is the result of increased power consumption for lighting at peak hours.Secondly, in spite of the drive to electrify all the villages, there will always be parts of India where providing grid-connected power is not economical, as the cost of laying wire will be much more than the cost of power generation. About 20 crore people, or four to five crore households in the country, have either no access to power or get only intermittent supply. Making energy-efficient lighting, especially those run on solar power, available to them will solve our energy access problem.What are the growth opportunities that energy efficiency offers to companies like yours in urban areas?
Home lighting, lights used by businesses and organizations and infrastructure and street lighting are the three major areas of power consumption. India has about three crore street lamps which remain lit for about 10 hours a day, which is a major segment of consumption. For businesses, upgrading to energy-efficient lighting offers a high return on their investment by way of savings in power bill. Payback period for upgrading all lighting systems ranges between two and three years. Almost three-fourth of all new lights bought by businesses are energy-efficient LED lights. There is also a trend among businesses to go for smart lighting, which can sense movement of people and the number of people in the surrounding and produce light accordingly. This intelligent lighting offers about 30% of energy saving in addition to the 50% saving that LEDs per se offer. Some organizations are now getting into what is called managed services. That is, companies like ours upgrade their lighting infrastructure and they pay us in instalments for using that infrastructure. Their savings from power bills helps them pay their instalments to the service provider. Manufacturing companies as well as information technology firms, which are very familiar with the concept of managed services, are going for this.Is smart lighting of streets catching up?
Many states have started to adopt efficient street lamps because of the Smart City initiative, but a lot more is to be done. India has 5,000 towns and at least 100 large cities and three crore street lights. Some cities have upgraded to connected smart street lights. One example is Naya Raipur, the new capital of Chhattisgarh. This city has probably the worlds most modern connected lighting infrastructure that is monitored remotely. The city engineer monitors the infrastructure from his office. If a bulb needs replacement, it gets reported automatically. We are also upgrading the lighting infrastructure of many cities in Tamil Nadu, including Chennai. Finances of the state and the municipalities concerned are important in going for an upgrade. The upgrade is quicker where the municipality concerned has a clear financial model such as central government funding or multilateral aid or lending. Besides energy saving, the cost of maintenance for efficient lights is less and the quality of light is also better.In overseas markets, especially in Europe, we have executed projects where lights remain dim when there is no one in the street and the light intensity goes up when movement of people or vehicle is detected. Indian cities have not gone for this level of sophistication, but the journey has started.The government promotes LED bulbs in a big way. Has it captured the market for home lighting?
In the consumer segment, about 30% of the lights sold today are LED bulbs and the rest are conventional bulbs. The large market share that conventional bulbs still enjoy is not because of any price advantage, but because they are more easily available in the neighbourhood. Its a question of distribution. Some of the LED options are cheaper than conventional bulbs. We need to address this.How can this be tackled?
Firstly, the products that should be adopted have to be of high quality and should be designed for the domestic market with high voltage fluctuation tolerance. Use of poor-quality products can sabotage the adoption of LED bulbs as it would adversely affect public perception of the benefits of energy-efficient products. The next wave of LED adoption will get supported by a robust retailing ecosystem. We go to a nearby retailer to replace a bulb, not to a power distribution utility that stocks these products. The total lighting market in India as per industry estimates is Rs15,000 crore a year. This excludes new pockets of demand such as the remote areas where solar-powered LED bulbs would be required.More than 93% of the lighting equipment that Philips sells in India is designed for India and is made in India.",2016-09-20,woGw5FGjDjQubIV5AEkyaP,"Philips Lighting India MD Harshavardhan Chitale on the lighting industrys changing dynamics

-0.81,"Petronet LNG Ltd is reaping the benefits of shortage of locally produced gas. Lower domestic gas production has meant improved demand for imported liquefied natural gas (LNG). In fact, in April-August 2016, LNG imports to India have risen about 26% year-on-year, according to Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell. Considering that domestic gas production is not going to improve overnight, the outlook for LNG is bright. Further, it helps that expected global LNG supply is likely to be more than demand, ensuring lower prices for some more time. In that backdrop, Petronet LNG, a company that imports LNG, finds itself in a sweet spot.
				   
				Its share price has surged an impressive 49% so far this fiscal year. Not without reason. For one, the company has brought forward the completion of 5 million tonne per annum (mtpa) capacity expansion at Dahej to October from its earlier guidance of end-2016. That will take the total capacity at Dahej to 15 mtpa.Unlike the Kochi terminal, Dahej has uninterrupted pipeline access and the lowest regas charges, pointed out analysts from IIFL Institutional Equities, adding that weak LNG prices will foster speedier terminal ramp-up. Use-or-Pay contracts and customer advances shield Petronet LNG from volatility in gas prices and demand, said IIFL analysts in a report on 29 September. Under use-or-pay contract, the customer will have to pay even if cargoes are not taken.If demand remains strong, Dahej could have a volume of 14 mt in FY17, said analysts from Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd in a report on 16 September. The brokerage firms current FY17 Dahej volume assumption is 13 mt. Each 1 mt in higher volume results in 9% higher earnings per share, according to Nomura.Petronet LNGs June quarter results were strong. Capacity utilization at its Dahej terminal increased to as much as 130% during the quarter from 111% in the March quarter. The company processed its highest ever volume in the June quarter. The September quarter, too, is expected to be strong.Given the above scenario, it is not surprising that the stock has outperformed the benchmark Sensex and the BSE Oil and Gas index so far this fiscal year. Currently, it trades at 22 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year. Thats not cheap. Moreover, concerns on underutilization of Petronet LNGs Kochi terminal remain, thanks to pipeline connectivity problems.

0.47,"Jindal Steel and Power Ltds (JSPLs) equity investors appear unperturbed by the companys debt getting a default rating, if the share price is a reliable indicator. Then again, its share is down by 65% from a year ago, so maybe the default rating is not news to them.
				   
				Crisil Ltd has rated JSPLs debt, all of Rs.32,638 crore, as default, citing delayed payment of interest on term loans due to weakened liquidity. Falling steel price realizations are affecting margins and this tough period is coinciding with obligations to repay debt. Delays in the companys plans to raise funds by selling assets, transferring certain assets to joint ventures and refinancing debt have not moved ahead.If JSPLs steel business is under pressure, then its power business too is suffering from demand and price volatility in the merchant market and lack of raw material integration, says the Crisil note. In addition to the debt downgrade, a 9 March Economic Times report indicated that lenders of foreign debt worth $500 million (around Rs.3,375 crore) may recall their loans.The problem is indeed a difficult one but it isnt new. All the negative news in this week prompted JSPL to issue a note which mostly reiterates what everyone knows but for a few points. The rating is based on technical grounds, it said, and added that the company had met its obligations till November-December. JSPL said it is confident that once its efforts to restructure debt are complete, it will not be in default. However, what is not stated is when this exercise will be completedthe quarter has barely 20 days to end.JSPL also said that additional steel and power capacity that have been commissioned are stabilizing. Higher output, improving demand and realizations should lead to better cash flows in FY17 than seen in the past four quarters. In the December quarter, its Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) was Rs.550 crore, while its interest cost was Rs.806 crore.Given time, it is reasonable to expect JSPLs business position to improve. The government is keen to ensure that both the power and steel sectors do better and, in turn, ensure that the banking sectors assets dont turn bad. Those measures are working and steel prices have begun to move up. Will this continue even as an increase in domestic steel capacity leads to more supply? A recent report by Morgan Stanley Research states that the worst is over for steel, as China is moving to curb its excess capacity. Even in power, the situation is beginning to look better.The real issues are how much time lenders are willing to give JSPL to get back on track, how long the company will take to work out a comprehensive debt restructuring programme, and how much time it will take for the firm to fulfil its plan to sell stakes in some of its operations. Buyers know its desperate situation and may drive a much tougher bargain than in normal times.A default rating does raise the fear, however remote the possibility, of all these measures not working out, and lenders moving in to take control. JSPLs statement indicates confidence that it will recover in FY17.

Domestically, the Sina Weibo microblogging platform and Tencents WeChat messaging app are more widely used. But Chinese entities, including the state news agency Xinhua, use Twitter to reach audiences abroad.Chen, who had worked with Microsoft and Cisco, was brought in to lure more Chinese advertisers to the platform.

-0.49,"London/ Melbourne: Rio Tinto Group moved closer to an exit from thermal coal after the worlds second-biggest miner agreed to sell most of its mines to a company controlled by Chinas Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. for $2.45 billion. Shares in both companies rose on Wednesday.
				   
				The sale, which includes Rios biggest Australian coal operation in the Hunter Valley region, leaves the company with only two producing coal mines in the country that was once the cornerstone of its energy business.It was kind of getting to the point where thermal was irrelevant, theyre an iron ore, copper, aluminum and industrial-minerals business, said Richard Knights, a mining analyst at Liberum Capital Ltd. in London. Now is a fantastic time to offload coal assets.Thermal coal prices surged last year after China introduced mining restrictions. Output by the worlds biggest producer and consumer of the fuel fell 9.4% in 2016, while imports reversed two years of declines to gain 25%, the biggest increase since 2012. Australias Newcastle coal, an Asian thermal benchmark, surged more than 80% in 2016, snapping five years of declines.Rio advanced 3.1% to A$66.76 a share by 1.31pm in Sydney, after closing at the highest since March 2015 on Tuesday. Yanzhou Coal Mining gained 0.7% to HK$5.89, after jumping the most in six weeks on Tuesday.The deal is the first major transaction by Rio under chief executive officer Jean Sebastien Jacques, who took over from Sam Walsh in July. Prior to being made CEO, Jacques headed the copper business. A company restructuring in 2015 led to coal being incorporated into the unit led by him.Payment termsThe sale to Yancoal Australia Ltd. is subject to Australian government approval and includes an initial $1.95 billion cash payment and $500 million in annual installments of $100 million following completion.Yancoal, which is 13% owned by Asian commodity trading giant Noble Group Ltd, said Tuesday the acquisition would make it Australias largest pure-play producer of the commodity. Chinese state-owned Yanzhou Coal owns 78% of the Australian Securities Exchange-listed company.Yancoal Australia jumped as much as 4.2% to 50 Australian cents, while Noble Group gained 0.6% to 17.4 Singapore cents.Yancoal will also make an offer to Mitsubishi Development Pty, which owns a 32.4% stake in the Hunter Valley coal assets, according to the statement Tuesday. Mitsubishi Corp. is considering whether or not to sell its share in the mine, said a spokesman who declined to elaborate and asked not to be identified, citing company policy. The parent added 0.6% to 2,601.5 yen in Tokyo trading.Rio has sold at least $7.7 billion in assets since 2013 as it sought to weather a downturn in commodities sparked by Chinas slowing growth and a glut of raw materials. It has been shedding Australian coal assets since dismantling its energy division in 2015.Other businessesAfter divesting its Mount Pleasant project and completing the sale of a 40% stake in the Bengalla venture to New Hope Corp. last year, the sale of its Coal & Allied Industries Ltd. unit to Yancoal leaves Rio with the Hail Creek and Kestrel mines, both of which are primarily producers of coking coal, used to make steel. The two mines produced a combined 8.1 million metric tons of coking coal and about 3.7 million tons of thermal coal last year.Rios coal business was already dwarfed by output from operations such as iron ore and aluminum, with the unit contributing less than 10% of its $34.8 billion in sales for 2015. Rio will report 2016 earnings on 8 February.The sale wont have a material impact on earnings per share, the miner said.Its retreat from coal comes against a backdrop of investor and regulatory scrutiny on the potential for untapped fossil fuel assets to be left stranded as governments adopt stricter climate change policies. Norways $870 billion sovereign wealth fund, the largest of its type in the world, last year moved to ban investment in companies that base at least 30% of their business on coal or revenue from the fuel.The sale may be a boon for Rio investors in the form of future dividends, Liberums Knights suggested.I dont think theyre going to be hoarding the cash, he said. They are making a tremendous amount of cash at the moment. Theyre likely to pay a dividend at the top end of the guidance and theres clearly scope for a decent sized special dividend. Rio said its shareholders will be required to vote on the transaction because Yancoal is considered a related party due to the fact Aluminum Corp. of China, which is also state-owned, is a 10% shareholder in Rio.

-0.06,"Undoubtedly, it was under A.M. Naiks stewardship that Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) earned a pride of place in the Indian equity markets.
				   
				From the time he took over the reins as chairman and managing director in 2003 and until date, L&Ts market capitalization has surged three times to Rs.1.425 trillion. This implies a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25%, which surpasses the 21% CAGR in the MCap index of BSE 100 companies during the period. Not just this. L&Ts stock, which trades at Rs.1,519, is reckoned by analysts, brokers and investors as the best play on the economy.The first major decision in his 13-year old journey at L&Ts helm to sell its cement business to the Aditya Birla group in lieu of the equity stake held by them in the firm, was creditable. For, it marked the end of takeover threats by big industrial groups and established greater employee and public shareholding. It also ended its presence in its only commodity playcement. Importantly, it marked L&Ts transition from a sizeable engineering and cement conglomerate into an indomitable edifice spanning several businesses such as hydrocarbons, heavy engineering, finance and information technology (IT).That said, L&Ts key focus area remains infrastructure, engineering and construction that today comprises about 45% of its revenue, compared with 83% from engineering and construction way back in 2004.Some analysts have been critical of Naiks diversification into unrelated areas such as finance and information technology (IT), though others consider these as cash-accretive businesses that would provide a hedge against economic recession.Proof of this was seen in the companys financial results during the last two years, when profit growth in the infrastructure segment dropped to single digits. Overall profitability got a leg-up from IT and financial services that did well and helped buck an economic slowdown.Again, Naiks decision to enter these businesses can be lauded in that the two recently announced public issues of L&T Infotech Ltd and L&T Technology Services will help unlock shareholder value as the money deployed in these businesses generates good returns.Further, Naik leaves behind a legacy of not just diverse businesses but diverse markets, too. From a pure domestic infrastructure firm a little over a decade ago, L&T is now present in new markets, such as West Asia. Today, almost one-third of its annual order inflows come from overseas, offsetting the slow pace of infrastructure development and order inflows in the country.Of course, in West Asia, the firms timing was perhaps wrong as the crude oil price crash stymied expansions in this region.L&Ts strength lies not just in diversification, but also in attaining size and scale in its businesses, enough to compete well.From FY03 till FY16, L&Ts consolidated revenue has grown at a CAGR of 19% to touch Rs.1.026 trillion. Growth in profit after tax has been even better at 23% CAGR.That said, sustaining fixed costs and overheads in the face of an economic slowdown is challenging. This is mirrored in its operating margin that has slowly started trending lower from 13-14% about a decade ago and is unlikely to improve in the near term.That apart, L&T could boast of a sizeable order book, enough to generate revenue for the next two years. But then, its balance sheet is also weighed down by the same. Economic slowdown and project delays due to tight liquidity conditions among customers has led to a surge in working capital requirements that is one-fourth its net revenue.The change of guard comes with huge challenges, too. Through Naiks tenure, L&T has been unable to churn out profits from some businesses. Its shipbuilding, heavy forgings, hydrocarbons, power and road subsidiaries are either loss-making or have wafer-thin profits.The scene is far from cushy in developmental projects that include roads, ports, bridges and urban infrastructure. For example, the FY16 annual report shows that while its road projects clocked single-digit revenue growth, high interest costs and depreciation translated into losses.The street is also concerned about the Hyderabad Metro project, mired in clearance hurdles and delays. It is likely to bleed once it is fully operational and weigh on L&Ts overall profitability.A Religare Capital Markets report says that decisions of capital misallocations in the recent past may not be addressed in the expected timelines. If so, it would tell on profitability. Meanwhile, analysts feel that FY17 will mirror the full impact of the new accounting (Ind-AS) norms, which could hurt profit growth given the more stringent provisions required.Be that as it may, Naiks successor is faced with the task of precariously balancing the juggernaut, until macroeconomic winds turn more favourable.",2016-09-09,x0cXVktXgElid8CsJZMZpL,"AM Naiks successor is faced with the task of precariously balancing the juggernaut, until macroeconomic winds turn more favourable

-0.52,"The debate on the beaching method of ship breaking could be settled by an application sent to the European Commission (EC) by a handful of Indian ship-recycling yards.
				   
				Five of the 167 ship-recycling yards located on the coast of Alang-Sosiya in Gujarats Bhavnagar district, home to the worlds largest stretch of ship breaking beaches, have applied to the EC to be included in its list of approved facilities where ships flying the flag of a European Union (EU) member state would be sent for dismantling at the end of life. The deadline for submitting applications closed on 30 June.By December, the EC will draw up a list of ship-recycling facilities that have demonstrated compliance with the ship-recycling regulation published by the EU in 2013.The application to the EC comes a few months after these five yardsR L Kalthia Ship Breaking Pvt. Ltd, Priya Blue Industries Pvt. Ltd, Leela Ship Recycling Pvt. Ltd, Shree Ram Group and Shubh Arya Steel Pvt. Ltdwon compliance certificates with a separate global regime that seeks to ensure that redundant ships are disposed of safely and in an environmentally sound manner.This was the first time such recognition has been given to ship breakers in South Asia. It goes a long way in dispelling doubts about the beaching method of breaking ships practised along a 10-km stretch of Alang-Sosiya, often subject to criticism for its lax safety and health rules, says experts.Under the beaching method, ships are first grounded and then dismantled, posing hazards to human beings and environment.The Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships was adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in 2009. It is, however, yet come into force because it has not been ratified by 15 states, representing 40% of world merchant shipping by gross tonnage (capacity) and a maximum annual ship-recycling volume not less than 3% of the combined tonnage of the states, to take effect globally.While the IMO convention does not prohibit the dismantling of old ships by the beaching method, a separate ship-recycling regulation published by the European Union in 2013 seeks to ban the method of dismantling ships practised in Alang-Sosiya.While the first four ship-recycling yards were certified for compliance with IMOs Hong Kong Convention by Japanese ship classification society Class NK, Shubh Arya Steel was certified by the Italian classification society RINA.In order to be included in the European list, compliance by a ship-recycling facility should be certified following a site inspection by an independent verifier.The first four ship recyclers have applied to the EC with documents from IR Class Systems and Solutions Pvt.

It will help them buy old ships for scrapping at lower rates because of the limited number of facilities that are compliant with the IMO and EU rules.The application of the five Indian ship-recyclers could also potentially create a dilemma for the EC.The list of approved recyclers of the EC is likely to include yards in China, Turkey, North America and the EU, but not those in South Asia, though some of them in the region have upgraded facilities to comply with the IMO regulation.Seventeen more yards in Alang-Sosiya have now been appraised and audited by Class Nk and RINA for certification of compliance with the Hong Kong Convention of the IMO.Many believe that ship recycling choice shouldnt be based just on geography and that the market must make a distinction between yards which use beaching and comply with the Hong Kong convention and those that do not.If the European Commission rejects our applications, it has to give a proper justification why they are doing so. If they are that stringent, their rules should not apply to yards in Turkey and China also, an executive with one of the five ship recycling yards said on condition of anonymity.In the run-up to the preparation of the list of approved ship-recycling facilities that have demonstrated compliance with EU rules, the EC is separately discussing a proposal to set up an EU ship-recycling fund, which, if accepted, will compel ships, regardless of flag, to pay for EU ship-recycling licences when calling at EU ports.The money that visiting ships would have to pay into a proposed EU fund, including those flying the flag of non-EU nations, would only be returned at the end of the vessels working life, many years later, when it will probably have a different owner and flag, and only on condition that the ship is recycled at a yard approved by the EC, according to the proposal.This will undermine efforts by the IMO to improve working and environmental conditions in developing nations, where most ship-recycling yards are located and the proposal must be rejected, according to The European Community Shipowners Associations (ECSA) and the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS)which represent over 80% of world shipping tonnage.ECSA and ICS argue the EU should concentrate its efforts on getting EU member-states to ratify the IMO Hong Kong Convention, and to recognize the efforts being made by recycling yards in Asia to gain certification in accordance with IMO standards. They insist these yards should be given a fair chance to be included in the EU list of approved recycling facilities.

-0.52,"The doubling of the coal cess may end up undermining the revival plan for state power distribution companies (discoms). Thats because the cess will further diminish the competitiveness of coal-based electricity at a time when renewable sources of power are getting cheaper.
				   
				To be sure, thermal tariff is still lower. NTPC Ltds average rate stood at Rs.3.21 per unit in the first nine months of this fiscal year, a good rupee less than the cheapest solar power rates. But when state discoms pass on the additional cess to end-consumers, the tariff would rise by 3-7% or 9-13 paise per unit, estimates Nomura. Now, note that this will be added aggravation for industrial and commercial consumers. This set of consumers is already paying high tariffsas much as three times the average NTPC rate and double the solar rates in some states.As solar gets cheaper and thermal power turns expensive, the viability for moving to their own renewable energy source gets better. The decentralized nature of solar capacityyou can put panels on rooftopsand the governments own push to step up renewable energy are key drivers.As this shift gains momentum, it could spell trouble for state discoms. Industrial and commercial consumers bear the brunt of discom inefficiencies and subsidize agricultural consumers. According to Power Finance Corp. Ltd, industrial and non-domestic customers together consume a little less than 40% of electricity, but generate 55% of SEB (state electricity boards) revenues.Once solar power storage becomes economical, it may see an accelerated adoption. Ind-Ra (India Ratings) believes this may disrupt the operations of the discoms as these industrial consumers are the highest tariff consumers which subsidize the retail tariffs, India Ratings said in a note. Once this cross subsidy decreases as industrial load reduces, the discoms would then opt to increase tariffs for retail consumers, at which point even the retail consumers may switch to rooftop solar power. This over a period of time could become a self-feeding loop.One of the large discom customers, Indian Railways, is already bypassing them by purchasing electricity directly from producers. The flexibility of solar (in terms of installation) can also drive other commercial and industrial consumers down a similar path.Of course, the shift may not happen overnight and all industrial customers cannot afford to build solar capacities. But if the government continues to load thermal tariffs with taxes, the shift may gather pace.",2016-03-04,xEYjx89e28XLyPofhvNhZO,"As solar gets cheaper and thermal power turns expensive, the viability for moving to their own renewable energy source gets better

-0.5,"The next few years will be definitive for the evolution of Indias digital infrastructure and the role it can play in the countrys growth. There is significant unfinished businessIndia is ranked 91st among 139 countries on the Networked Readiness Index 2016, compiled by the World Economic Forum (WEF). Only 15 out of 100 households have access to the Internet, and mobile broadband remains for a privileged few, with only 5.5 subscriptions for every 100 people, according to the WEF. However, India has skipped a generation in telecom technologygoing from no connectivity to over 350 million mobile Internet usersin less than two decades. This needs to be factored in while planning the democratization of digital access in India. 
				   
				The impending growth of digital assets will present India with many unique opportunities to leapfrog its traditional deficit in physical infrastructure. It will help enhance the economic conditions in remote areas, spur new businesses by enabling access for a large number of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), creating a strong digital identity for the country. Above all, digital infrastructure growth can empower the government to embrace and enable innovation, provide resources to help increase agricultural productivity as well as enable improved healthcare access for rural areas, potentially reducing mortality levels. It can also bring financial services to the unbanked rural and underprivileged communities and help fulfil the countrys longstanding goal of education for all. Digital literacy in smaller towns and villages can create employment in sectors such as business process outsourcing (BPO), retail, IT, telecom and financial services. Digital India can also ensure citizens have ubiquitous access to government services. While mobile technology has begun to make a transformative impact, digital access in Internet dark areas, could have a larger socio-economic impact.                                                                                                                              *******While the story of the potential value that Indias digital infrastructure can add, has been told many times, developments in this sector have so far lagged expectations. The governments flagship projectthe National Optical Fibre Network (NOFN)is yet to fulfil its promise for rural India. In this scenario, we continue to trail the worlds major economies in telecom infrastructure maturity and penetration. Network investments by mobile operators are being held back, due to the poor economics driven by low tariffs and a high level of competition. This has hit carriers ability to upgrade consumer services, meet demand in highly populated urban areas and expand networks to provide coverage to rural areas. The next few years could see unprecedented changes in the quantity and quality of digital access. Few would argue against the need for a robust digital infrastructure in India. However, one must realize that the economic barriers to that are very high. The following factors will be key to achieving Indias digital infrastructure dream:Expanding spectrum assets: Few policy changes have a greater impact on infrastructure creation, than optimizing spectrum availability over time by releasing unlicensed spectrum, revising allocations and enabling free sharing and trading. Spectrum is a scarce resource. The ever-increasing projections of mobile traffic growth in India, make a compelling business case for allocating more spectrum for mobile usage. These allocations need to include licensed and unlicensed spectrum bands to accommodate both network coverage and capacity needs. While India has taken a few steps in the right direction such as the department of defence releasing spectrum in the 1,800-2,100 MHz bands, it still needs a better and more comprehensive spectrum policy. India lags behind many developed and emerging markets in per-capita availability of spectrum. Also, the cost of spectrum here is one of the highest in the world. The primary goal for policymakers should be to maximize the use of spectrum, rather than focusing on its short-term value. Also, the more harmonized the spectrum used by mobile operators, the more economically viable the overall solution to improving Internet access. This calls for effective synchronization of Indias spectrum planning, allocation, network design, financing and construction. Also needed is a national policy to enable access densification in areas with low-income but high-growth potential.Creating broadband infrastructure: Let us turn our attention to the resources required for the creation of broadband infrastructure. India currently ranks low in broadband penetration, even among developing countries. Internet access has grown, driven by a higher penetration of mobile handsets and wireless infrastructure in urban and tier I and tier II towns, but  broadband penetration in the larger part of the country is still dismal. Current estimates show that broadband only reaches approximately 600 corridors, largely in and around the top 50-100 Indian cities. On the other hand, the country aspires to create a Digital India with a broadband highway offering a 100-Mbps connectivity to 250,000 gram panchayats. The funds needed to create a national IP backbone and ensure last-mile connectivity have not been supported by a strong underlying business case. The creation of Digital Bharat calls for radical changes to regulatory frameworks, allowing the generation of viable business models for inclusive broadband growth. There is significant public funding involved in making NOFN come true, but private sector operators have so far seen little value in pursuing fiber deployment beyond the top cities. This calls for the creation of robust models of public-private partnership, driven by a combination of rights of way, release of spectrum and creation of a content ecosystem to spur revenue generation via digital infrastructure. Enhancing technology adoption: This is the other side of the story, where industry participants need to get their act together. Over the last few years, new and existing players have made significant investments in transforming the infrastructure for 3G/4G/LTE roll-outs. In a country with relatively low average revenue per user (ARPU), carriers will need to continue focusing on infrastructure build-outs to increase coverage and improve customer service quality. With a large part of the data consumption moving indoors, the industry needs to move towards small cell deployments. White-labelled small cell deployment makes great economic sense for all high-demand concentration centres. Further, developments in software-defined-networking (SDN) and network-function-virtualization (NFV), have the potential to redefine the economies of infrastructure deployment for operators. Virtualization needs to become business-as-usual. This will make infrastructure deployments simpler (commodity hardware with centralized software), more cost effective, agile, reliable (battle-proven commodity hardware) and flexible (digitally defined network topology and functions). These virtualized networks will be at the core of the telecom industrys digital transformation, redefining our infrastructure into a programmable platform for a variety of new services. As an example, business-to-business connectivity business models are already being completely disrupted with software-defined wide area networks.                                                                                                                             *******Ultimately, the economics will work when there is demand for services and development of new use cases. The creation of the content and services stack in remote locations, will be key to drive adoption. There are multiple areas where digital infrastructure can play a big role in creating opportunities. These include public and law enforcement records, health data including patient and insurance records and academic and employment records. Other areas include location services, digital identity including identifiers and demographics, communications and local content. Multiple stakeholders need to come together to create an effective ecosystem of content, services and governance that will increase usage, ultimately creating the business case for a robust public-private investment. But implementation of such initiatives is fraught with constraints related to consumer privacy, ownership of data, data security and protection. Digital India will become a reality only if we can create the data ecosystem required and find solutions to overcome these constraints.Over the next few years, we need to prevent market failures in digital infrastructure creationfailures that are borne out of unfavourable economics and lead to suboptimal development of digital infrastructure and issues in both quantity and quality of digital access. The scale of change required to make this happen is disruptive and unprecedented. For digital infrastructure to take root and flourish in India, all stakeholders will have unique roles to play. For individual business leaders, it will mean overcoming technical, economic and business model-related growth challenges in a transformative way. Ultimately, the combination of public-private funding, progressive government policies and freeing up of spectrum assets will determine whether India is able to fully address the digital divide. The initiative will also hinge upon faster adoption of new, cost-effective technologies by industry players and the creation of compelling business use cases. Now is the time for all stakeholders to come together to transform India into a digital economy.Kanchan Samtani and Sumit Sarawgi are partners and directors at BCG.Twenty-five years after liberalization, and 20 years after it entered India, The Boston Consulting Group collaborates with Mint on a series of articles on what lies ahead for the country over the next 20 years.",2017-01-24,xLnErGf2Mq9xDQYj3VHWmI,The impending growth of digital assets will present India with many unique opportunities to leapfrog its traditional deficit in physical infrastructure,both,02:55,Building Indias digital highway
0.01,"The benefit that cement manufacturers got from low input prices in the June quarter, which translated to better margins, is likely to reverse. And some brokerages have started raising red flags about it. Cement companies should brace for some erosion at the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) level in the September quarter due to hardening fuel costs.
				   
				Data provided by S&P Global Platts shows that globally, the prices of thermal coal, the FOB Richards Bay 6,000 kcal/kg, surged from $50.283/mt in the beginning of the year to $62.445/mt in July. Richards Bay 6,000 kcal/kg NAR (net as received) is a grade bought by Indian buyers, especially cement companies. The chart represents the monthly average price of this grade of coal on a free-on-board (FOB) basis. This is the price the buyer pays to purchase coal and get the cargo loaded on to a mother vessel at Richards Bay Coal Terminal in South Africa.Similarly, average petroleum coke, or petcoke, prices rose from $45/mt in January this year to $81/mt in August. Supramax cargo of imported petcoke with typical 6.5% sulphur is delivered to Indias east coast port of Krishnapatnam. S&P Global Platts has been tracking the price of petcoke delivered to India on a weekly basis from March 2015 and this is highest price since then.Petcoke prices were trading at about close to $40/mt CFR India (CFR=cost and freight) in March this year. Cement companies found this price very attractive and started procuring in huge quantities, shifting from thermal coal. In fiscal 2016, total India petcoke imports stood between 3.5-4 million tonnes . But this year, in July alone, more than 1 million tonne of petcoke arrived in India, Deepak Kannan, managing editor, Asia Thermal Coal, S&P Global Platts told Mint.Maintenance issues with a few US refineries earlier this year tightened supply while demand continued to rise, leading to a steep increase in petcoke prices, while thermal coal prices have been driven by supply cuts and a shift in demand, he added.According to some experts, while it is certain that margins will begin to erode from hereon, it is difficult to quantify the exact impact now because some cement companies may have petcoke inventories acquired at low cost. Also, the hit on margins would vary from one company to another based on their usage of petcoke and coal.In the last three months, domestic petcoke prices have surged from Rs.1,200-1,500/tonne and players like ACC, Ambuja and UltraTech have increased petcoke usage to 60-75%; hence, operating cost is expected to harden from current quarter. Considering 50% of impact in current quarter, power and fuel cost is likely to surge by Rs.50-100/tonne. Further, increase in crude price also has an impact on packaging costs. However, looking at price trend of first two months of 2QFY17E, average price tends to be higher by 2-3% year-on-year, which may provide a cushion and arrest margin erosion, an analyst with Reliance Securities said.Further, Kannan cautioned that as the monsoon season ends, Indian buyers are expected to come back into the market for restocking, but they are staring at very high coal prices.The second quarter of the fiscal year is a seasonally weak one for this industry. The demand lull has led to a correction in cement prices in most parts of the country.

The past few weeks have seen the share underperform the BSE FMCG index as well as the broad market. The surprise then, really, would be if it is spared an aggressive hike. In the past one year, the stock is down 26%, while the FMCG sector index is down by 17.2%.
				   
				Excise duties on cigarettes have been hiked in four consecutive budgets, knocking cigarette companies down every time they began to recover from the after-effects of the previous hike. ITC has protected its margins hitherto, passing on the full price hike to customers and reshaping its product mix to sell more premium products. Volume growth has suffered, however, as consumers shifted to cheaper products or if ITC were to be believed, to smuggled cigarettes.A Mint report on 24 February said retail cigarette prices have already gone up anticipating the hike and that stock market analysts are pencilling in an 8-10% hike in duties. That would not be considered a bad thing, especially if the increase were around the 8% level. The fear is if the government takes the duties up by a much higher quantum, say a 15% increase.In ITCs case, cigarette volumes have been hit hard, with an estimated 12% decline in volumes in FY16 as per an Edelweiss research report. Whats worse, its much feted profitability is also under pressure. In the December quarter, the cigarette segments profit margin declined by 1.6 percentage points over a year ago. That is a concern.There are two main triggers to watch for in FY17. A moderate hike in excise duty is likely to be welcomed. The second one is up in the air, really, at this moment. Broad urban consumption trends signals a revival may be in the works. What is common to buying shampoos and cigarettes? Nothing.Some years ago, cigarette consumption was considered to be relatively price-inelastic. Indeed, smokers puffed through price hikes without noticing it. But steep successive duty hikes and the price hikes that followed appear to haveat least temporarilydamaged this inelasticity. Affordability has become an issue. So, if urban incomes turn healthier, affordability should improve, which may in turn influence demand. Price may not be the only reason for declining volumes and maybe the anti-smoking efforts are also succeeding. That is another angle to this story.

				Against hopes of a better asset quality, the lender saw its fresh slippages increase again, the stock of gross non-performing assets (NPAs) double from a year ago and its net profit drop by 34% in the September quarter.Slippages during the quarter were Rs10,341 crore and the tally of slippages for the first six months of this fiscal year is at Rs19,131 crore.Its gross NPA stock got the distinction of crossing the Rs1 trillion-mark in the June quarter and it inched up a little more in the September quarter as well.To be fair, investors should have seen this coming especially after the disappointing results of other corporate lenders such as ICICI Bank Ltd and Axis Bank Ltd. Perhaps there was a thread of doubt that had investors playing safe as the SBI stock has hardly moved over the last two months. But the stock was rightly punished on Friday, with the disappointing results driving down its shares by over 3% to Rs272.90 apiece.But there is more bad news. Out of SBIs Rs19,131 crore loans that slipped during the six months ended September, 40% was from its declared watch list. The management had put out a corporate loan watch list of Rs34,776 crore in March and at that time, analysts were comforted by the quantum given the lenders huge loan book size. But 60% of SBIs slippages have come from outside its watch list. While the list is now down to Rs25,951 crore, it is not sufficient to look at it excluding the larger book. A quarter of the watch list has already slipped, much of it stemming from the weak sectors like construction, roads, and iron and steel. Asset quality of its mid-corporate segment and small and medium enterprises hasnt stabilized for over a year now.Given that SBI would soon be a bigger behemoth after the merger of its associates, a look at the consolidated balance sheet is a must. The picture gets worse as the bad loan ratios of its associates are massive and their combined gross NPA ratio was 13.77% for the quarter and that of SBI was 7.41%. All of its five associates were loss-making for the six months ended September. By the very nature of its vast franchise and size, SBI would command a premium to its other peers.

As of now, based on what information I have, I believe it (Q4) should be on expected lines.Chandrasekaran downplayed concerns over a clamp down on H-1B visas, critical to software firms such as TCS, in the context of the new administration in the US and said the company is well prepared to cope with any increase in wages for its US employees or a lowering of the visa ceiling.I cannot comment on the margin impact; but since 2015, we have been preparing ourselves to work in a visa-constrained environment. So I dont think there will be any impact on us, said Chandrasekaran. Earlier this month, a legislation demanding that outsourcing firms pay at least $100,000 a year to employees who work in the US was introduced in the US Congress.TCS does not give a quarterly or yearly guidance, and the companys underperformance in the nine months of the current year means it will at-best report a 6% dollar revenue growth, lower than the 7.1% growth reported last year.TCS has added $786 million in incremental revenue from April to December this year against $783 million in new business in the first nine months of 2015-16. Significantly, for the first time since TCS went public in 2004, its annual growth will be less than or at best on par with Accenture Plc., which is double the size of the Mumbai-based firm. Accenture grew 6% in the year to August last year (Accenture follows September-August as financial year), helped by  15 acquisitions , which brought 2 percentage points of overall 10.5% constant currency growth. TCS has shied away from buying companies.It is status quonothing materially different than the second quarter. It is important to note that expectations are already so low that even if the company meets the low end of these expectations, it is considered to be a decent show, said a Mumbai-based analyst at a domestic brokerage, on condition of anonymity.At the heart of TCSs underperformance is its inability to build a stronger consulting practice and the managements reluctance to buy small hi-tech firms. TCS also faces some client-specific challenges. Nonetheless, TCS said its digital business in the third quarter rose 6.6% on a sequential basis and 30.2% over the year-ago period to $737 million, or 16.8% of its quarterly revenue.Its revenue from banking, financial services and insurance firms, which accounts for 40% of total revenue, reported a 2.1% increase in constant currency terms. TCS reported a 2.2% improvement in the US, which accounts for 55% of total revenue. Revenue growth in the UK, which brings about 13.3% of total business, rose 1.7%, while the India business, which brings about 6.3% of revenue, jumped 10.3%.TCS managed to retain more employees in the quarter, as attrition for IT services stood at 11.3% and including back office unit (BPO business), attrition was 12.2%. Shares of TCS rose 0.87% to Rs2,343 on BSE on Thursday, while the benchmark Sensex rose 0.39% to 27, 247 points.The results were disclosed after the markets closed.",2017-01-12,y5EWGSFJ6cRDGp7gSgCXRJ,"Tata Consultancy Servicess revenue in dollar terms grew 0.3%, sequentially, and increased 5.8% from a year ago",company,16:15,"TCS Q3 profit rises 8% to $1 billion, beats forecasts"
-0.65,"On a recent afternoon in northern Beijing, Chinese 20-somethings lean over a long blond-wood table in a retail store, examining colourful smartphones and fitness bands. The white walls and spare space recall an Apple Store, but on display is a wider, and more curious, range of products: smart rice-cookers, hoverboards, robot vacuum cleaners, bathroom scales and air purifiers. A tall salesman in a bright blue T-shirt says they are planning to soon cordon off an area to demo Xiaomi drones.
				   
				The brightly lit store is one of 36 locations across Greater China operated by Xiaomi Corp., a Beijing-based smartphone-maker that has been frequently touted as the Apple of China. But Xiaomi has a very different strategy: Instead of meticulously designing products in-house, guided by the technical and aesthetic vision of a Steve Jobs-like figure, Xiaomi is investing in dozens of Chinese hardware start-ups, branding the devices with the Xiaomi label, and selling them in stores and through its website.The gadgets can be operated from a Xiaomi smartphonea classic Internet of Things playand are typically priced near the low range of competing products. The rice cooker costs about $150, more expensive than traditional electronic cookers, but far below top-end products from Philips and Toshiba, which can run to $450. The Mi Band 2 fitness-tracker costs $22, about a fifth the price of Fitbit Alta.The strategy is familiar enough: hook customers on an operating systemMIUI, a heavily customized version of Androidso theyll stay loyal to the brand and keep buying more products. Liu De, who runs Xiaomis new ecosystems products division, says the business will pull in 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) this yearsplitting profits with Xiaomis hardware partnersand double that in 2017. He accepts that this is a very ambitious goal.Xiaomi badly needs a second act. A couple of years ago, the company was Chinas top smartphone seller and for a time the worlds largest unicorn after Uber. But its dominance has proved fleeting because consumers have moved upmarket. They want to get more premium phones and are willing to pay more, says Jessie Ding, a China market analyst at Canalys. However, Xiaomis specs have not changed much over past two years. Meanwhile, competition from domestic phone makers has intensified, knocking Xiaomi into fourth place.The company is trying to claw its way back. Led by vice president of global operations Hugo Barra, Xiaomi is pushing into other developing markets. India is a particular focus because, like China five years ago, most consumers want value for money, says Tarun Pathak, a market analyst at Counterpoint Research. But he says it wont be long before Indians, too, will want better phones. Later this month, Xiaomi will launch a premium smartphone with a screen that curves around the side like a Samsung Edge, according to people familiar with the plan. A smart watch is also expected to debut later this year.If the new phone doesnt jumpstart sales, Xiaomis growth prospects may rest with Liu and his ecosystems division. To date, Liu says his team has invested in more than 60 start-ups, largely founded in the last three years, and remains a minority shareholder in most of them. Xiaomi also offers input on product design and marketing. We target big markets, big demands, he says, explaining that the aim is to maintain a steady pace of innovation so consumers will want to replace or upgrade every few years.Chief among the start-ups is Huami, the fitness band maker, which was founded in 2014 by serial entrepreneur Wang Huang. It has raised money from Sequoia, Morningside Venture and Banyan Capital. Headquartered in Beijing, the company also has a Silicon Valley engineering office and more than 300 employees. In the US, it has launched the pricier Amazfit fitness tracker. It resembles a wristwatch adorned with a jade-pendant-like sensorevoking traditional Chinese jade jewelrywhile tracking steps and calculating calories burned. Huami declined to comment.Most of the products in the Xiaomi ecosystem have a similar modern aesthetic, with simple colours, rounded edges and minimally fussy dials or buttons. Part of the sales strategy involves persuading consumers to buy things they dont know they need.Unveiling the smart rice-cooker this spring in Beijing, Liu De displayed a chart with two coloured lines indicating, respectively, optimal stickiness-sweetness and optimal texture-colour; where they cross, he explained, is perfect rice. Customers using Xiaomis cooker can scan the bar code on rice packages to detect grain variety and other information, and select from literally thousands of combined heating options to cook peak rice. Xiaomis sleek white bathroom scale has an LED dial thats not visible until you step on the scale; it also uploads your weight to a smartphone app, allowing you to track weight gain or loss over time.China is set to embrace a consumption boom over the next 10 to 20 years, we see that crystal clear, Liu says. What Xiaomi aims to do is to feed these surging demands by introducing products with good quality at a relatively cheap price. The companys focus, he adds, is on consumers in Chinas second- and third-tier cities, especially those between ages 17 and 35.Clay Shirky, author of the 2015 book, Little Rice: Smartphones, Xiaomi, and the Chinese Dream, and one of Xiaomis most vocal admirers, is skeptical. Its not clear that theres a business-to-consumer model that works for the so-called Internet of Things, he says. What do you want your fitness band to say to your rice cooker? Why does your television need to be in communication with your Segway? No one has gotten that right, not even Amazon.To date, Huami is the most obviously successful device company in which Xiaomi holds a minority stake. Huamis Mi is the top-selling fitness band in China, according to Canalys, and No. 2 globally after Fitbit. However, Ding says, supply-chain hiccups hurt Mi band shipments earlier this year and it will take time for Xiaomi to get its other start-up partners shipping products reliably. Whats more, theyve yet to deliver many appealing hardware innovations, according to IDC analyst Jean Xiao. She says Xiaomis drone didnt offer any more features that market leader DJIs model. Then DJI lowered its price, so it was actually cheaper than Xiaomi.Dont count Xiaomi out, Liu says. The company isnt aiming to compete on the high-end with DJI or anyone else. Our primary goal remains to serve the growing middle class in China.",2016-10-20,y5bperrzUbKPbFBmEYASZO,"Xiaomi is investing in dozens of Chinese hardware start-ups, branding the devices with the Xiaomi label, and selling them in stores and through its website",competitor,10:34,Xiaomi bets on smart rice cookers

-0.44,"India remains attractive for foreign investors despite the imminent interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve and UKs decision to leave the European Union, John Woods, chief investment officer for Asia-Pacific at Credit Suisse Private Banking, said in an interview. Edited excerpts:
				   
				In January, you had written that you are neutral about India as the growth and reform potentials are still suppressed by political factors. Has your view changed since then? We are cautiously constructive on India from a fundamental perspective. We know it is one of the fastest growing economies among the major economies. We are positive about its valuations. We think capital inflows into India is likely to accelerate as the focus on emerging markets continues. Thats why we are overweight on India within our asset allocation for the Asia-Pacific region and just recently turned overweight on China as well. We are recommending these two markets to our clients.Some people say the Indian equity market is overvalued.We were looking at the price earnings ratio for the next year, which is at around 16 times. For us, that is not particularly expensive. It is not particularly cheap either. It is fairly priced. The problem seems to be consumer-related stocks are quite expensive and capital consumption stocks are quite cheap. What we would like to see certainly is greater evidence of growth in the manufacturing and industrial sector, greater evidence of capital expenditure and therefore profitability growth. That would paint a more balanced picture of the choices open to investors.What are your growth projections for India?We are looking at GDP growth of 7.8% and 8% for next year. We expect the Sensex to close this year at around 28,500. We got a pretty positive outlook for next year. We are looking at 30,500, equivalent of 10% growth from current level, which would be a record high for the Sensex. We are absolutely positive on the equity story.What makes you so bullish about India?It is the fundamental story relative to the rest of Asia that is actually quite attractive. It has a growth rate most economies will die for. It has quite a positive story on consumer spending, which pretty much the rest of Asia is also seeking to expand as well. The reality is we have a positive forecast for a large number of countries in Asia because we think the emerging markets will continue to benefit from the inflows from developed markets. We have seen evidence of some of those inflows already. 2016 has been a great year for a number of emerging markets, particularly based in Asia. Our forecast is a combination of our views on dollar, on commodity prices, on interest rates and domestic factors as well.So, how will a US Fed interest rate hike change those assumptions?We think the Fed will hike interest rate in December, but we only anticipate one or two hikes next year. In other words, it is going to be a very shallow trajectory. That is pretty positive for emerging markets. It means dollar is likely to stay soft, liquidity continues to seek yield and carry. They will continue to be attracted towards economies like India, which offers both yield and carry. In May 2013, we saw the taper tantrum and we saw foreign investors attack India because it had quite unmarked external imbalance in terms of its current account deficit. Thats corrected quite dramatically since then. Foreign exchange reserves have improved quite substantially since then. The economy itself has got a much better reputation among foreign investors due to the liberalization programme.But what are the risks for emerging markets like India?The risks are focused on unexpected spike in inflation in the US because of rise in commodity prices. Then we have to start repricing the Fed, the US dollar, the term structure of bond yields and that would have quite profound effect because then the US will become the yield and carry story and all the money that were seeking carry and yield in emerging markets will go back. But the important point is we are seeing an end to deflation. The last two years or so, the global economy was hammered by deflation. Chinas latest PPI (producers price index) was for the first time positive in five years. As you know people have been accusing China of exporting deflation to the global economy, that has now ended. So we are seeing more signs of positive inflation, which leads to positive sales growth, improved profitability, improved earnings and a healthier stock market. Thats the kind of virtuous cycle that shapes emerging markets such as India.But do you think Brexit has been priced in completely by the investors?The positive effect of Brexit has certainly been priced in. As you know there were a lot of dooms day predictors. They have been proven wrong. Unemployment is now extremely low, the PMIs (purchasing price indices) are extremely high, the stock exchange is getting higher and higher, sterling itself is a great shock absorber. The UK has one of the highest current account deficits among the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries and 20-30% correction in sterling is a very good way of correcting that imbalance. The medium term implications of Brexit are uncertain. But the UK has a huge trade deficit with the EU. So I cant see it necessarily why it is in the EUs interest to burn its bridges with one of its important markets in the world. So I do think there will be mutually beneficial agreement ultimately because both parties want access to each others markets.The government is exploring ways to deal with the bad loans in public sector banks. Do you think a bad bank will be an effective tool in Indian context?In principle, recapitalizing the banking system through the vehicle of bad bank makes perfect sense. If your banking system is unable to extend credit because it is too focused on repairing its capital adequacy and provisioning for its non-performing loans, then how will the economy grow? How can credit be extended particularly to the manufacturing sector and it is one of the problems facing India right now. So the idea to create a vehicle to recapitalize the financial sector by taking out the impaired assets and thereby improving the quality of the balance sheet clearly is a very good idea. The devil always is in the detail. How do you actually do that? Who takes the hit? Should shareholders pay up or should the government pay up? In China, for example, that was originally done at face value.Do you agree with the IMF assessment that credit is growing at a dangerous pace in China and its economy risks an eventual disruptive adjustment?We dont think there will be a credit event in China over the next year because there is an extremely important national Peoples party congress in October 2017 and it is our view that until that meeting happens, the government will continue to provide support and cushion any downturn in economic growth. We have in fact upgraded Chinas economic growth to 6.5% this year and 6.3% in 2017 (from 6% earlier). So not only do we not see a hard-landing, we actually see some evidence of economic acceleration vis-à-vis our previous forecast.10-India has proposed a BRICS credit rating agency as it thinks the current rating system is quite biased against developing countries. Do you agree? Do you see scope for another rating agency?I think it is a fantastic idea. Any effort to provide independent, impartial view of an operating environment through the rating of individual companies can only increase transparency of a business environment. The problem that comes up is how impartial this rating will be? Can I trust the quality of the rating and that clearly has to take time. Initially, there will be some caution and wait and see attitude among investors whether the quality of this credit analysis replicates other rating agencies. But the big problem that I see is when you have a niche rating agency, foreign investors are unable to make a rating assessment at a global level based on a consistent set of rating methodology.",2016-10-25,y93PTvzUvdnZZYE9ZPmK4L,"Capital inflows into India likely to accelerate as focus on emerging markets continues, says Credit Suisses John Woods",competitor,01:27,"Sensex could touch  30,500 points in 2017: John Woods"

Of this, power purchase agreements (PPAs) have been signed for 2,520 MW and PSAs (power supply agreements) for 2,725 MW. Earlier in January, the solar power tariff had hit a record low, with Finland-based energy firm Fortum Finnsurya Energy quoting Rs4.34 a unit to bag the mandate to set up a 70 MW solar plant under NTPCs Bhadla solar park tender.

				Provisions and contingencies surged 755% to Rs2,074.94 crore in the July-September quarter from Rs242.70 crore a year earlier. The loss during the second quarter was restricted due to a tax write-back of Rs197.12 crore against tax expenses of Rs189.87 crore a year ago.This is one of the biggest losses reported by an associate bank of the State Bank of India (SBI). In the April-June period, State Bank of Travancore had reported a loss of Rs743 crore due to deteriorating asset quality concerns.The drop in profitability of associate banks might be a result of the impending merger with State Bank of India, which has been approved by all of them. In August, the respective boards of SBI, State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Travancore, State Bank of Hyderabad and Bharatiya Mahila Bank had all approved the mega merger, which will create a large banking conglomerate in India. According to a Mint analysis, this will put SBI in the ranks of the top 50 lenders in the world.The associate banks reported large losses as a direct result of the asset quality review (AQR) conducted by RBI in the October-December period last year, SBI management had stated earlier.Their AQR was very different from ours and this was required in order to align our books, so that when it (merger) happens, there are no surprises. All of the associate banks, going forward, will come back to form. This was the first quarter and maybe there will be another quarter (of pain) and then they will come back to form. They are all operationally healthy, so it shouldnt be much of an issue, SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya had said while announcing the SBIs first-quarter results on 12 August.Since the beginning of this financial year, State Bank of Hyderabads net profit has declined consistently owing to rising provisions. As on 31 March, the banks net profit was Rs253.13 crore. This fell to Rs28.14 crore as on 30 June. Provisions at the end of the fourth quarter of the previous financial year were Rs538.41 crore, which rose to Rs893 crore in the April-June period.Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) at the Hyderabad-headquartered bank jumped 196.2% to Rs15,306.98 crore at the end of the September quarter from Rs5,167.80 crore a year ago.

-0.38,"Cement companies have announced price hikes in some regions in anticipation of good demand after the end of the rainy season. While prices are increased around this time every year, this time around it also has to do with a steep surge in petroleum coke (petcoke) prices.
				   
				In any case, the price hikes are hardly anything to get excited about, especially keeping in mind where valuations of cement stocks are.But first, it must be noted that the recent hikes are on expected lines, and may be enough to only cover increased costs. A recent ICICI Securities Ltd report said petcoke prices have risen by nearly 80% over the past six months, which is likely to impact margins in a seasonally weak period, and the brokerage firm expects it to be passed on to consumers in the medium term. Companies have announced price hikes of Rs10-50/bag across most regions in September 2016 mainly on reversal of price fall during monsoon, the report added.Prices in western, eastern and southern parts of India have seen a rise while prices in central and northern India remain more or less stable, say some analysts. Some experts such as Amey Joshi, associate director at India Ratings and Research Pvt. Ltd, say that prices may increase further in October. At that time, many companies would be looking at replenishing their petcoke stocks at an increased price, and hence would pass on the increase in costs to customers, he says. While a hike in prices to cover the increase in costs is welcome, it is clearly not enough to support the record valuations of cement companies. In a report titled, Testing the upper bands of optimism, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities write, Cement valuations continue to scale new peaks, meaningfully higher than historical bands and despite optimistic earnings assumptions that carry downside risks. Large cement companies have rarely breached the 15X EV/EBITDA on one-year forward estimates over the past decade, and accordingly, we see no scope for multiple re-rating from here. EV is  short for enterprise value while Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.In the near term, the seasonally weak second quarter of fiscal year will end in a few days from now and some analysts have already cautioned about subdued performance from cement companies, especially on the operating margins front due to increase in fuel costs, which could lead to a short-term correction in these stocks.Though some experts maintain that the second half of the year will be better for cement companies, the impact of the aforesaid price rise and whether or not the much-anticipated revival in demand has happened, remains to be seen.The fact that the industrys capacity utilization is currently low at less than 70%, it does leave ample room for volume growth, especially if a strong economic recovery is on the cards. But that cant be taken as a given, especially if capacity additions are higher than expected. Again, current valuations assume strong growth and much more. Kotaks analysts write, The pitfalls of poor earnings predictability may make asset-based valuation a suitable alternative check on valuations. Our analysis of gross block addition for the large cement companies and their individual capex plans, suggest capex of Rs 5.5 bn/mtpa (US$84/ton at spot rate) and transaction multiples of US$115-140/ton, (which is) significantly lower than trading multiples of US$127-304/ton for pan-India companies.",2016-09-19,ylAw4aKIaVgwuFWRkThqFN,"While cement prices are increased around this time every year, this time around it also has to do with a steep surge in petroleum coke (petcoke) prices",both,23:28,Cement price hikes on expected lines

				The dynastic business that built a reputation over more than a century for discretion, integrity and fair-dealing has sunk into a public spat of allegations and name-calling. Its directors trade barbs. Its share price is tumbling. And on Friday, executives were jostled in the street while security staff engaged in an unseemly brawl outside Bombay House, the groups revered headquarters.How did it come to this?The drama dissecting Tata Sons, Indias largest industrial group, revolves around Ratan Tata, scion of a family that built an empire so diverse that it writes financial software for Goldman Sachs Group Inc., sells pick-up trucks in Uganda and offers packaged salt to Indian families at Rs.18 a kilo.Two weeks ago, Ratan Tata threw the group into confusion and the public spotlight after the Tata Sons board sacked his successor as chairman, Cyrus Mistry, and wrested back control for the 78-year-old. Neither Tata nor any other board member or major investor has suggested that Mistry financially mismanaged the group. He remains head of many of the affiliate companies, such as Tata Motors and Tata Steel.Instead, Mistrys ouster was the result of growing discontent from Tata, who ran the company for two decades, at what he considered was an undermining of the Tata brand, according to people who have worked with both and asked not to be named because the matter is private.Egos have been bruised, said Harsh Goenka, chairman of RPG Group, another Mumbai-based conglomerate. He said the Tata name stands for humility, humaneness, benevolence, grace and boldness of vision, and it has been dented by the current conflict.Since Mistrys removal as group chairman, Tatas more than two dozen listed companies have lost in excess of $8 billion in market value. Ratan Tata didnt respond to a recent request for an interview.Brand TataTatas adherence to the idea of the brand being a byword for integrity has run throughout his career, according to interviews with more than a dozen people who have worked with him. Banks would routinely do business based on Tatas word, and once he committed to doing something, he would see it through no matter what, said a person with knowledge of some of his deals.When Tata Steel bid for Corus Plc in 2006, it arranged financing with three banks for around $5 billion to $6 billion, said the person, who asked not to be named because the negotiations were private. As the price rose in a bidding war for the European steelmaker, Tata officials found cheaper funding, but would have to pay a break fee with the original banks of about £80 million ($99 million). Some executives tried to negotiate a cheaper release, but when the matter was brought to the attention of Ratan Tata, he insisted the original contract be honoured, the person said.Tatas decision echoes the groups current spat with Japanese telecommunication partner NTT Docomo Inc., which is one of the key battlegrounds in the war of words between Tata and Mistry. Docomo is trying to enforce a London Court of International Arbitration decision ordering Tata Sons to pay $1.17 billion for failing to uphold a contract, signed during Ratan Tatas 21-year period at the helm.A Tata Sons spokesman declined to comment while Mistrys office referred to a 1 November statement on the companys partnership with NTT Docomo.Tata became frustrated at Mistrys seeming reluctance to pay, which reflected on the Tata name, according to people familiar with the case. In an email to the directors after his removal, Mistry said it was the board that has not covered itself with glory, by the way he was dismissed.Family codeBut the Tata family code, rigorously pursued by Ratan Tatas predecessor, the legendary industrialist, aviator and philanthropist J.R.D. Tata, extends far beyond just sticking to your word.J.R.D., whose portrait looked down from the boardroom wall in Bombay House as Mistry was being ousted, made Tata famous for refusing to pay bribes. He founded many of the businesses that are now key units, such as Tata Motors, and funnelled a large chunk of profits to social programs such as Asias first cancer hospital and the Tata Institute for Social Sciences.He handpicked Ratan, the great grandson via his adopted father of group founder Jamsetji Tata, to carry on that family legacy. Trained as an architect at Cornell University, Ratan began on the shop floor in 1962, stoking Tata Steels blast furnaces, before gaining experience in several positions in the group.In 1991, he took over the chairmanship and set about establishing his dominance over group companies, which had become rich and autonomous during J.R.D.s five-decade reign.In the 1990s the Tata Group was ruled by powerful satraps and he very dexterously distanced all of them from their powerful positions and gained total control, said Goenka, chairman of RPG. The one common factor that defines Ratan Tata then and now is that of an astute leader. He eased out Cyrus Mistry from the chairmanship that took India Inc. completely by surprise. If the past was about a loud war cry, the present is about stealth.During his first chairmanship, Tata expanded the company rapidly, often by acquisition, turning a predominately India business into a global group with $103 billion in salesahead of Gazprom and International Business Machines Corp. He also sowed the seeds for many of the groups current troubles, including the purchase of Corus, the venture with Docomo and the ill-fated Nano car project.Since about 2004, with the question of his succession looming, Tata gradually increased his control in the operations of the group, said a person who worked closely with both Mistry and Tata. He took major decisions with less board consultation than previously, the person said.Ratan Tata has always consulted senior executives in all his decisions, including the Corus acquisition, said a Tata official, who asked not to be identified citing company rules.New successorThe eventual choice for a successor was Mistry, the son of one of the biggest shareholders in Tata Sons, his own brother-in-law and a fellow member of the Parsi communitythe isolated followers of Zoroastrianism whose ancestors fled to India from Persia a millennium ago.With Mistry deposed, Tata is back at the helm promising to find a new successor before March. Next month he will be 79.I do not think Ratan Tata has any option other than to hold on to the position that he has taken back, whether he likes it or not, said Kavil Ramachandran, executive director of the Thomas Schmidheiny Centre for Family Enterprise at the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad. In the interest of every stakeholder, he has to take steps to get the situation back on track.While Ratan took the groups products to more than 100 countries, he retained the ethos of his predecessors, that in building a business you are also helping to build India.Nano InspirationThe Nano was inspired by seeing an Indian family riding on a motorbike in the rain. It epitomized Ratan Tatas qualitieshis vision and attention to detail, as well as his stubbornness and reluctance to terminate a key business thats losing money.Tata spent hours with the Nano development team, focusing on getting every detail right for the most anticipated auto release of 2008, said a person who worked on the project. Yet the car was marketed as cheap, a stigma that was reinforced by dealers who had little interest in pushing a low-margin vehicle.When Mistry led the introduction of Tata Motors latest modelthe unfortunately named Zica hatchback, rechristened Tiagohis main concern was how to ensure the car would be profitable, according to the person who worked with both Mistry and Tata, and asked not to be identified as hes not authorized to speak to the media. Mistry talked to staff about what he, and even his children, thought of the marketing campaign and what needed fixing, the employee said.Ratan Tatas vision for the group was a globally diversified and successful conglomerate with some distinctive values, said Rishikesha T. Krishnan, director and professor of strategic management at the Indian Institute of Management Indore. Cyrus Mistry did not dismantle that vision, but he appears to have been particularly concerned about the viability of different businesses.If something went wrong, Tata would tell you to your face and then take immediate steps to rectify the problem, said a senior Tata Sons executive who has known Ratan Tata for more than two decades. He described Tata as a humanist with a deep sense of compassion, who was keen on products that fostered social justice like the Nano, or Tata Salt.In 2012, after grooming Mistry for the top job for a year, Tata stepped down as group chairman, and moved from his relatively modest apartment to a white, three-story house he built on the seafront near the exclusive Colaba neighbourhood of Mumbai, with a private gym and rooftop infinity pool looking out over the Arabian Sea, according to local newspaper reports.Start-up InvestingHe threw his energies into working with entrepreneurs, investing nominal sums in more than three dozen startups ranging from artificial intelligence to online sales of womens lingerie.Those who met him spoke of his imposing presence, graciousness and attention to detail in how ideas would work.Mr Tata. listens intently, has a curiosity to learn and often gives a fresh perspective that hasnt been considered, said Vani Kola, head of venture capital fund Kalaari Capital. He notices the smallest things, he puts people at ease.At the same time, he continued to keep any eye on the Tata Group as head of the powerful family trusts that hold a majority stake in Tata Sons. According to several people who know Tata, he became increasingly frustrated by what was happening to the company that bore his name.On 24 October, before the board meeting in Bombay House, where stray dogs are allowed to roam the corridors, Mistry was told of the decision to remove him.Cyrus Mistry was handpicked by Ratan Tata, said Goenka. This time he will look for someone who understands the Tata culture and the Tata way of doing things, better. Bloomberg",2016-11-08,ylJCy9morUM9QsY5DRkqhN,"Tata group, the dynastic business that built a reputation over more than a century for discretion, integrity and fair-dealing has sunk into a public spat of allegations and name-calling",both,11:24,Ratan Tatas return as interim chairman seen taking toll on Brand Tata 
-0.96,"Mumbai: AkzoNobel, the global paints and coatings company known best for its Dulux brand of paints in India, launched Denim Drift, a smoky grey blue, as colour of the year for 2017. In India to launch the findings of its annual global study ColourFutures 2017, Jeremy Rowe, managing director, AkzoNobel Decorative Paints, south east and south Asia, the Middle East, talks about India as an important market, global trends in the paints industry and why consumers are more inclined to certain colours culturally. 
				   
				Edited excerpts:How important is this market for you?Asia is a very important market for AkzoNobel across paint categories. If we talk specifically about decorative paints, then India is already the third largest decorative paints market in the world after the United States and China. If you look at the growth rates of India and what we expect in the next few years, it will be second, or even the largest market at some point in the future. Thats not too surprising in a way because the paint markets are really driven by things such as home renovation and re-painting, so obviously, housing, having a young population, rising income all contribute to growth of the paint market, plus investment in infrastructure by governments and industries. And because that is what we expect a lot of in the medium long term for India, it will be an increasingly important market going forward for us. The Indian decorative paint market is about Rs20,800 crore growing at about 8-9%, the organized market is a large part of the market, and the top four players account for 90% of the organised market.What is the colour prediction for this year? How do you arrive at that prediction?Its a question were often askedabout what colour will be up and coming, whats trending, which is why we started the ColourFutures programme 14 years ago. It wasnt about us inventing a trend, it was about us discovering what is trending at an early stage, trying to identify that, and around the time when were launching it, to amplify it for our consumers and professional customers. The process takes about 18 months, its a global research initiative across different cultures which draws insights from a multitude of influences not just in interiors but also fashion, fine art, architecture, technology, music and pop culture among others, and broader societal trends. The colour prediction for 2017 is Denim Drift best described as a smoky grey blue. Its a relaxing, universal, introspective colour. Mainly because when people are deep in thought, they tend to look up at the sky. People were wanting to step back from the complexities of modern life, look back, and find something simple and meaningful in the lives. Its really about looking at life in a new light and blue is a great colour to represent that. Also, its a versatile colour and is very easy to integrate.Do consumers in different cultures pick colours differently?Colours interact with people at a human level. There are almost universal responses to certain colours such as blues, reds, greens. But thats always overlaid with a cultural response to a colour. And theres individual meaning you associate with colour, perhaps youre more inclined to a colour because it reminds you of a sports team you support. Having said that, culturally, there is a predominant use of white and pale colours in the north of Asia, to the use of vibrant, particularly warm colours - the reds, yellows and oranges in the South of Asia. South-East Asia is in between the two, not as vibrant as India but definitely more so than China. These are deep cultural trends which have been going on for a long time. Also, you have specific cultural meanings, so red for the Chinese which generally is around wealth and success. Yellow for Thailand is a colour of the royal family and the monarchy, which has an important, deep meaning for the Thai people. Which is why colour is an endlessly complex and fascinating area to work in because there are so many colours, and what we do is provide inspiration and advice. In the end, you will choose what is right for you.What are the key global trends?The aesthetic trend is quite pronounced, the increased use of deeper more dramatic colours and special effects. The second would be paint that does more, by bringing newer functionality to the paint. In this part of the world, heat causes houses to expand and contract and the problem with that is that it causes cracks, so innovations such as crack-proof technology helps. And then there is sustainability, people are increasingly interested in who is making the product, how they are making it and how long will it last and important question of sustainability which is about doing more with less.AkzoNobel has featured in the top ten on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for almost a decade now. From a business perspective, how important is that?In our view, it is the most well recognised independent benchmark of companies. It is a ranking that investors will look at. Whats more exciting is to talk about our products that do more, and are active products in a way that they help consumers manage either sustainability or cost. One is interior light reflectance. So if you use that paint on your walls it will reflect twice as much light. What that means is that you use less wattage of light in areas that you dont want to spend too much energy on, such as stairwells. Its a passive investment in the wall which saves you money on your utilities. Same with external heat reflectors, if you can prevent the walls from heating up outside you end up spending less energy cooling it from the inside. Then there are paints that can take pollutants away from the internal environment. Another big one for us is the use of water based paintsthats because traditional solvent-based paints release greenhouse gas. So if we can get painters to transition to water-based alternative, it decreases the carbon footprint.",2016-12-13,z27X1MXEYHushkXcx5zNyO,"Jeremy Rowe of AkzoNobel Decorative Paints talks about India as a key market, global trends in the paints industry and why consumers are more inclined to certain colours culturally",competitor,13:10,Jeremy Rowe: Colour is an endlessly complex and fascinating area to work in 
0.63,"When spot prices are lower than that of contracted long-term prices, it is natural for consumers to be reluctant to make long-term purchases. Thats what happened with Petronet LNG Ltd. Moreover, the anticipated revision of the RasGas, Qatar, contract led to further reduced offtake. 
				   
				For the December quarter, long-term volume was about 38 trillion British thermal units (trillion Btus), representing just two-fifths of the contracted volume. As a result of lower long-term volume, the firm had to bear ship idling charges worth about Rs.85 crore in the quarter.Sure, short-term volume and volume from services (tolling) increased, and compensated for the lack of long-term volume. Still, capacity utilization fell. Petronet LNGs Dahej Terminal has operated at around 109% of its nameplate capacity for the December quarter against 120% for the September quarter. The volume regasified at Dahej Terminal last quarter was 138 trillion Btus compared with 154 trillion Btus for the September quarter. The Kochi Terminal handled only a nominal volume of liquefied natural gas (LNG), according to the company.The outcome: Petronet LNG reported results sharply below expectations. Operating and net profits declined 32% and 28%, respectively, against the September quarter to Rs.316 crore and Rs.178 crore, respectively.But investors need not lose sleep over this. While the Petronet LNG stock has declined 7% from its annual high in January, it has substantially outperformed broader markets so far this fiscal year. The company has renegotiated the RasGas contract in December-end and that removes a key risk. The worst then could be behind us. Long-term volume is likely to recover in the current quarter. Outlook on spot volume too is not bad. Huge liquefaction capacities coming up in Australia and US will keep spot LNG prices subdued, resulting in higher demand for spot volume, point out analysts from Elara Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd.The Petronet LNG stock trades at 16 times next years earnings estimates, factoring in most of the positives. The firm maintains work for expansion of Dahej LNG Terminal from 10 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) to 15 mtpa is on track. The capacity expansion is likely to be completed by year end.

-0.85,"San Francisco: Microsoft Corp.s effort to halt the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) so-called sneak-and-peak searches of e-mails may ride on whether its allowed to defend its customers constitutional rights.
				   
				The judge who will decide whether the case can go ahead told the companys lawyers to be ready in court Monday to address earlier rulings that undercut their arguments. At stake is half of Microsofts case to block the US from secretly accessing customer data stored in the cloud, including e-mail.Microsoft drew support from tech leaders including Apple Inc., Google and Amazon.com Inc. when it sued the US justice department in April. They say the very future of mobile and cloud computing is at risk if customers cant trust that their data will remain private. The federal law allowing searches goes far beyond any necessary limits and infringes users Fourth Amendment rights against unlawful search and seizure, they contend.The justice department argues it needs such digital tools to help fight increasingly sophisticated criminals and terrorists who are savvy at using technology to communicate and hide their tracks. Disclosing the searches would undermine investigations and put Americans at risk, they argue. A decision for the US would give an early victory to President Donald Trump, who said during his campaign that he would compel technology companies to cooperate.ALSO READ: IBM touts Donald Trump-pleasing hiring plans while firing thousandsThe case may never reach that point unless Microsoft wins the argument that it has the ability to sueor standingto protect customer privacy.Rights-case barrierStanding has been a barrier in cases that seek to vindicate peoples privacy rights, said Jennifer Granick, a Stanford Law School professor. Its a serious issue in conducting constitutional litigation, and this case is no different.Four court decisions listed by US district judge James Robart in Seattle all reached the same conclusionFourth Amendment protections can only be cited by individuals, and not vicariously by third parties. The most recent was a 2014 US Supreme Court ruling that the family of a driver who was shot and killed by police after a high-speed chase couldnt invoke that right on his behalf related to a lawsuit over his death.Microsofts lawyers may have anticipated the Fourth Amendment challenge in their complaint, stating that the governments silent searches of user data have directly injured it by eroding the customer trust in the company.The industrys push against government intrusion into customers private information began in the wake of Edward Snowdens 2013 disclosures about covert data collection that put them all on the defensive.Microsoft said when it filed its lawsuit that federal courts had issued almost 2,600 secrecy orders barring it from disclosing government warrants for access to private e-mail accounts. It said more than two-thirds of those orders have no fixed end date, meaning the company can never tell customers about them, even after an investigation is completed.Free speechThe Redmond, Washington-based company concedes there may be times when the government is justified in seeking a gag order to prevent customers under investigation from tampering with evidence or harming another person. Still, the statute is too broad and sets too low of a standard for secrecy, Microsoft contends, arguing regarding the other half of its case that its own free-speech rights are being violated by the orders.ALSO READ: Donald Trump said to sign executive order on Trans-Pacific PactThe Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy group supporting Microsoft in the case, fears a ruling that the company cant sue could mean no one will ever have the right to file a data privacy lawsuit under the Fourth Amendment.

				Only one of the largest banks of the USMorgan Stanleygot a conditional passing grade and two others, Deutsche Bank AG and Santander Bank NA, both US subsidiaries of European banks, failed. In the previous year too, the duo did not qualify.The stress tests essentially gauge whether the banks in the US with at least $50 billion in assets each have enough capital, management bandwidth and other safeguards to survive a financial crisis. Ahead of the stress tests results on 29 June, the Fed had said that all big banks would be able to make it through a recession. Since the global financial crisis in the aftermath of the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in September 2008, the banks have been directed to create a cushion of large capital against likely losses from a recession or any other developments that shock the market. The 29 June statement has also outlined areas where the Fed expects further improvement next year.The RBI stress test, on the other hand, indicates that risks to the banking sector increased significantly in the second half of 2015-16, driven by deteriorating asset quality and lower profitability. Indeed, the financial system is resilient but it could become vulnerable if the macroeconomic conditions deteriorate sharply.ALSO READ:
 S4A wont solve the bad loans problem

Saddled with bad assets, the banks are expected to remain risk-averse and not lend money to corporations; besides, in the absence of adequate capital, their ability to lend will also be impacted.Simply put, Indian banks are caught in a vicious cycle: They are not willing to lend for fear of adding to bad assets; this dents their interest income and profitability; and that, in turn, further erodes their ability to lend as they are not able to plough back profits to bolster their capital.The credit growth of Indian banks slowed to 8.8% in March 2016 from 9.4% in September 2015; the growth in deposits too declined from 9.9% to 8.1% during this period.The gross non-performing assets (NPAs) as a percentage of advances rose to 7.6% from 5.1% and, overall, the proportion of stressed advances rose to 11.5% from 11.3%. After setting aside money, the net NPAs of banks rose sharply, from 2.8% to 4.6%, between September and March. On every parameter, the state-owned banks are in a far worse shape than their private peers.In March, the top 100 borrowers accounted for almost 28% of credit to all large borrowers and little over 16% of Rs.75.3 trillion bank credit. They also accounted for more than one-fifth of the gross NPAs of the Indian banking system.The RBI stress test suggests that gross NPAs of the banking system may rise to 9.3% by March 2017 under a severe stress scenario. For the state-owned banks, it could be as high as 11%. Higher bad assets will force banks to set aside more money, dent their profitability, and they would need capital infusion to be able to support the demand of loan from the corporate borrowers.Unlike the US Federal Reserve, which identifies the banks that fail the stress tests, the Indian banking regulator does not expose individual banks and rightly so, as this could lead to a run on a bank with a large number of depositors rushing to withdraw money simultaneously, due to concerns about the particular banks solvency. In such a scenario, the money kept by a bank with RBI in the form of cash reserve ratio as well as the government bond holdingwhich could be liquidated to generate cashmay not be enough to cover the deposit withdrawals. RBI prefers to talk in terms of number of banks at risk and not who they are. For instance, stress tests on banks credit concentration risks, it says, is significant for eight banks, accounting for a little over 12% of advances, and they may end up having capital less than what they require.ALSO READ: 
How many banks are swimming naked?

Since 2010 when the first signs of stress were seen, the government has pumped in Rs.67,734 crore capital to keep the public sector banks running. It has agreed to infuse an additional Rs.70,000 crore even as the state-owned banks will have to raise over Rs.1 trillion from the markets to meet their capital requirements. Media reports suggest that the finance ministry has already finalized the plan for the first round of capital infusion of around Rs.10,000 crore. After pumping in Rs.25,000 crore in 21 state-owned banks last fiscal year, the government has committed to offer Rs.25,000 crore capital to these banks in the current year and another Rs.10,000 crore each in 2018 and 2019.For the big US banks and their investors, the annual stress tests are extremely critical as those who pass the grade are entitled to pay dividends and buy back stocks from their shareholders. In the Indian context, such a test still largely remains an academic exercise as the government seems to believe in a perpetual unconditional bailout theory.In the thick of global financial turmoil, the US Treasury announced a Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, of up to $700 billion to save its privately managed banks from the so-called subprime mortgage crisis. Most of this amount has been invested, loaned or paid out by the Treasury and the banks have returned more in the form of interest, dividend and fees. The band-aid approach that India follows will keep the system alive but one cannot expect a turnaround till such time the government accepts that capital infusion is just one of the tools and it needs to do more to revive the weak banks. Meanwhile, wary of corporate credit, now they are chasing retail loans; the trend will continue till they burn their fingers.ALSO READ:

-0.74,"Nandan Nilekani, former chairman of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), says India has a unique edge over other countries when it comes to payment systems in the battle for supremacy in the fintech resolution. Nilekanis observation comes at a time the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is preparing to launch an upgraded version of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), called UPI 2.0, by early next year. Nilekani, who serves as an honorary adviser to NPCI on innovation and public policy and was one of the key brains behind UPI, said that once some of the teething issues with the current version of UPI are sorted out, the system will be ready to take off in a big way, especially in e-commerce. In an interview, he spoke about how UPI was created in the first place, the role played by the likes of NPCI and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its development, and whats next for UPI. Edited excerpts:
How was UPI conceptualized in the first place and how did you go about building it?The foundation of UPI is really the highly successful IMPS (Immediate Payment Service) that NPCI launched five-six years agoaround 2011. This was a remarkable innovation because for the first time it gave you 24x7 instant credit. For example, in a very short period of time, in less than five years, the volume on IMPS has gone to Rs24,000 crore a month and it has become the de facto way of doing remittances in India. Thats the great success story that NPCI created and is really the first product to do instant credit. But it couldnt be used for merchant payments because for that you need instant debit Then some of us got together and were discussing that with the rise of smartphones, there was a need to build on the success of IMPS and to build something which was world-class, could do both credit and debit, smartphone-to-smartphone, etc. Then NPCI appointed me as an honorary adviser on innovation and public policy so that I could share my inputs and entered into an MoU (memorandum of understanding) with iSpirt (software product industry lobby group)... This all happened in late 2014. Then in February 2015, we had the launch of UPI by (RBI) governor (Raghuram) Rajan, who was always a big supporter of the idea. It took them a year to get the software built by RS Software, etc. So it was basically built as a layer on top of IMPS with debit. And then all these great innovations came, like virtual payment address (VPA), push-and-pull payments, etc.all that was the work of the iSpirt and NPCI teams... It took us more than a year to get it done. Then the actual launch happened in April 2016. Then another two-three months to test out everything and get all the banks going. And finally they went live about a month ago.What were some of the triggers behind the creation of UPI?We felt we were in a unique position because there was an organization like NPCI which was a very strong organization on payments, set up by the banks and owned collectively by the banks. And this organization had come into being coincidentally around the same time as UIDAIboth came up in 2009. There has been a very close working relationship between UIDAI and NPCI, which led to the creation of Aadhaar payment bridge, etc. Since it was a bank-owned utility, it was well-geared to offer an interoperable system. RBI was supportive, not just the governor but also the department of payments.How is UPI different from other payment systems in countries like the US and China?In the US and China, its like a walled garden where a couple of key players control the system. For example, in China you have the likes of WeChat and AliPay. With UPI, anyone can build on top of it and innovateits open and inclusive. Its almost like being on a highway without any toll gates.Whats your assessment of where UPI is at right now? What are some of the things that still need to be fixed?This is a mammoth task taking a countrys payments system and make it go into the completely 21st century online real time...across smartphones, fully secure, encrypted, virtual payment addresses, etc. This is a major thingthere are bound to be teething issues. There are some teething issues in onboarding customers and so on, but I think its all par for the course. Itll take a couple of months to settle that down. But as more banks like SBI (State Bank of India) and HDFC (Bank) come online, more and more of Indias banking terms will be on UPI. And then once all these teething issues are sorted out, Im very confident itll take off because it is such a superior value proposition. Both for online and offline merchant payments and both for online B2B (business to business) payments.Whats next for UPI? What should we expect in the next 6-12 months?The idea is that in the next couple of months all the technical issues, all the onboarding issues, all the user interface issues would have been shaken outany concerns that people have. All the banks will be live. All the major merchants should be live. There will be a few hundred thousand customers who will be ready to transact with their VPAs and apps. And there will be choice for consumers to select very attractive apps from a number of banks. Once you have that, you have the ground conditions for take-off. My sense is that the first take-off will happen in the online, e-commerce world. And then the same thing will migrate to the offline world...The big thing to remember is that in the typical card world, you went from offline to online. In the UPI world, were going from online to offline.",2016-10-12,zV5lj7FoBJ2s1KM8orBEKJ,"UIDAIs former boss Nandan Nilekani on the origins of Unified Payments Interface, NPCI and RBIs role in its development, and whats next for UPI",competitor,03:32,UPI is almost like being on a highway without toll gates: Nandan Nilekani
0.76,"At one point, packaged consumer goods makers were tipped to benefit immensely from falling prices. That did not happen. Now that inflation is gearing for a comeback, consumer companies (and their investors) may wonder if they can expect a return of good times. The Wholesale Price Index (WPI)-based inflation for April rose by 0.34%, reversing a decline seen for 17 straight months (the decline had tapered in the past six months).
				   
				Why did companies not benefit so much when costs declined? This period also coincided with weakening consumption demand, with urban demand initially affected by poor economic growth and then rural demand getting hit by bad weather and falling rural wage growth.When costs decline in such an environment, larger companies fear they will lose share to smaller ones if they keep prices unchanged. This has happened before. Tough economic conditions unhinge brand loyalty quite easily, as consumers try to make every rupee count. Smaller firms are quick to respond to near-term changes in costs.Since the larger companies feared they could lose share, they passed on lower costs by way of volume discounts or price cuts. They even spent more on advertising and promotion, and even in this difficult environment endured a substantial increase in salaries (blame that on the hiring boom for e-commerce, perhaps).Cutting product prices meant that sales growth in value terms and profit growth tapered. They did report having retained customers and market share. But the pain on the profit front has been a drag on valuations. In the past one year, the S&P BSE FMCG index has been almost unchanged.Therefore, news that deflation may have become history raises the question of whether the adverse situation will neatly reverse. Crude oil prices have come off their lows, which can affect related raw and packaging material costs. Rising vegetable oil and sugar prices can affect packaged food companies. Palm oil prices have been increasing and that could see related costs for soap production rise. Note that inflation is not widespread across categories, and the monsoon rains (if they are as good as predicted) may bring food prices down. But it does seem safe to say that inflation has reversed its declining trend.So, will the larger companies hike prices now? No. Smaller firms will feel the pinch initially and possibly increase prices as their procurement costs rise. The bigger ones will wait and increase prices only when they are confident it will not affect demand. That should see sales growth exceed volume growth and eventually benefit profit growth. How soon this reflects on their performance depends on how consumers respond to a hike in product prices, when it happens.Rising inflation may not be good news for some parts of the economy, for interest rates and even disposable income. Given how the past few years have turned out, packaged consumer goods makers may welcome a bit of support from inflation.",2016-05-16,zXHxVPTlPFVkn08mNMfeUK,"As inflation gears up for a comeback, consumer companies, and their investors, may wonder if they can expect a return of good times

-0.24,"New Delhi: One of the biggest expectations with Union Budget 2017 was that the government would divulge details of how much money has come back to the banking system after demonetisation. While the budget has disappointed in terms of giving overall statistics on this count, it does give an idea about the extent of money which has come in deposits of Rs2 lakh and above.
				   
				This is what Arun Jaitley had to say in his budget speech: After the demonetisation, the preliminary analysis of data received in respect of deposits made by people in old currency presents a revealing picture. During the period 8th November to 30th December 2016, deposits between Rs2 lakh and Rs80 lakh were made in about 1.09 crore accounts with an average deposit size of Rs5.03 lakh. Deposits of more than 80 lakh were made in 1.48 lakh accounts with average deposit size of Rs3.31 crores.Union Budget 2017: Key highlights and themesThe total amount which has been deposited under these two categories can be calculated by multiplying the number of accounts with the average deposit figures mentioned by Jaitley. This gives a figure of Rs5.48 lakh crores for deposits worth less than Rs80 lakh and Rs4.89 lakh crore for more than Rs80 lakh. The aggregate deposits under the two categories amount to Rs10.38 lakh crore. This works out to around two-third of the total value of demonetised currency, which was valued at around 15.44 lakh crore. These figures also tell us that around 31% of total value of demonetised currency has come back in individual deposits of Rs80 lakh or more. These figures show that a large chunk of the demonetised currency which has come back into banks is from the super-rich.How much of the deposits reflect unearthed black money?According to Jaitley, there are more than 3 lakh companies which show profits. There are 76 lakh individuals who report annual income greater than Rs5 lakh. Out of this 56 lakh individuals belong to the salaried class, which means that their avenues for tax evasion are extremely limited. The rest 20 lakh individuals include businessmen and professionals.It is possible that several of the high-deposit accounts belong to those who are already in the tax net, and have legitimate reasons for holding on to cash. The finance minister has not said anything about whether these are individual or business accounts. In the latter category, a lot of cash could be classified as cash in hand for business purposes, and it would be difficult to say whether these deposits reflect unearthed black money.However these numbers point to one unequivocal conclusion: most of the super-rich did not flush their cash stocks down the pit. Instead, they have chosen to park their money with banks, fully aware that this might invite scrutiny from taxmen. It is therefore likely that they will have good answers ready if and when the taxmen come to ask questions. There is very little reason to hope that the post-demonetisation data mining exercise will help unearth a significant amount of black money. This should not come as a surprise to those who have taken even a cursory look at the findings of taxmen on black money, who have reported in the past that cash is the least preferred way of holding unaccounted money.",2017-02-01,zhdFUJDvLzNJNFe0puDjbO,"About Rs10.38 lakh crore in demonetised currency was deposited in 2.57 lakh bank accounts, showing that a large chunk of the amount came from the super-rich",competitor,21:08,Arun Jaitleys budget speech gives clues about demonetisation deposits in banks
