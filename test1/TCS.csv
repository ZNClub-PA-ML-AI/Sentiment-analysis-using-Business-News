0.48,"Two sets of findings, related to societal trust levels, in a report released last week at the World Economic Forums annual meeting in Davos, should be a cause of grave concern to all of us. Part of a study released by communications group Edelman, the survey of more than 33,000 people in 28 countries including India, recorded the largest-ever drop of trust in business, government, the media, and non-government organisations (NGOs).
				   
				Corporate chief executive officers (CEOs), whose credibility level dropped in each of the countries surveyed, were aggressively targeted with only 37% of people saying they trusted them.The 12-point drop from the previous year is the all-time low since the survey began in 2001. This isnt the first time the corporate sector has been reminded of declining peoples trust. Last January, Young & Rubicam BrandAsset Valuator revealed that consumers trust in well-known brands continues to fall.ALSO READ | What global CEOs are watching for, according to a PwC surveyStrangely, you would think that CEOs reputation for trust would have taken a hit from the work of the media. But that institution didnt fare too well either with 43% of the respondents expressing trust in the press, down from 48% the year before. So if peoples falling trust in company executives isnt driven by the reports in traditional media, where is the angst coming from? Perhaps theres a third force now that might be responsible for generating the ire and thats the social media, the new watchdog for corporate wrongdoing.Edelman CEO Richard Edelman, speaking at the WE, linked this to the sky-high compensation levels of top CEOs as well as the fact that employees were disappointed their leaders were not helping them deal with automation and the changing business environment. These changes have led to a rash of lay-offs in recent times with companies as diverse as Oracle Corp., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Microsoft Corp. trimming their work forces.ALSO READ | Of founders and CEOsIn India, close on the heels of the controversy last year when several well-funded start-ups rolled back offers made to fresh graduates from engineering schools, comes the news this year of large scale sackings. Just this week, Girnar Software Pvt. Ltd, which runs a series of auto portals including CarDekho and is funded by such heavyweights as CapitalG (formerly Google Capital), Sequoia Capital, Hillhouse Capital and Ratan Tata, announced that it was axing 136 people.Paradoxically, for all the efforts CEOs and top leaders make to build their image, it is the companys rank and file that is viewed by the public as more trustworthy.Indeed, twice as many respondents would have employees rather than CEOs communicate financial earnings and operational performance.Why is trust important? Business analysts have frequently proved that there is a direct correlation between growth and trust.ALSO READ | Optimism reigns in India as CEOs, consumers look beyond ChinaAmerican behavioural economist and psychiatrist Richard L. Peterson and sports consultant Frank Murtha noted in 2008 after the financial crisis: Trust is the oil in the engine of capitalism, without it, the engine seizes up. Confidence is like the gasoline, without it the machine wont move.Part of the reason for the increasing trust deficit is of course the overall culture of lower deference towards authority figures and institutions. But that isnt all of it. In 2016, for instance, Volkswagen AG CEO Martin Winterkorns resigned following the emissions scandal, Fox News CEO Roger Ailes lost his job following a sexual harassment charge, Mylan CEO Heather Bresch became a public enemy when she trebled prices of life-saving injection EpiPen, and Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf came under fire for refusing to take personal responsibility when his bank was caught creating two million fake accounts. Closer home, Vijay Mallya took employees, shareholders and bankers for a right royal ride before flying to the UK as creditors closed in on him.The resulting trust deficit has had several disastrous consequences. Corporate loyalty is fast going the way of the dinosaur. As employees feel free to change jobs at will, this has led to mounting costs of hiring and training besides a struggle to build team spirit and group dynamics. Externally, there is a lower threshold level of tolerance for any slippage in corporate performance. One quarter of declining numbers and stakeholders start demanding changes either in terms of management or worse still, strategy.Corporate trust deficit is a two-way street. It indicates that employees, customers, and company watchers have problems believing what its top executives say. But equally it also indicates that the company itself is in some kind of trouble.Sundeep Khanna is a consulting editor at Mint and oversees the newsrooms corporate coverage.

-0.02,"Pune: The 57-year-old boss of Tech Mahindra, C.P. Gurnani, says that Indian technology outsourcing companies have always transformed themselves in the past and that it will be wrong to write off the countrys $150-billion outsourcing industry even as new technologies disrupt the landscape. In an interview in Pune last week, Gurnani shared the bets Tech Mahindra is making and why he remains confident that the company will be able to remain relevant even as technology fundamentally changes the way companies across industries do business. Edited excerpts:
Analysts and commentators have started penning obituaries for the Indian IT outsourcing industry. From your perch, what is the future of Indian IT and Tech Mahindra? It will be wrong to write us off. I see the present as exciting times. Remember, Indian IT has seen changes all throughout its life. It all started with Father Kohli (F.C. Kohli, the first CEO of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd). The model then was that companies said, we have consultants and we will give them to you. Then the Y2K moment happened, which was like an inflection point.  In all these decades, the industry has grown. So, even now, the focus for Tech Mahindra, and I believe other Indian heritage IT firms, is that you need to make sure we remain relevant. Technology is changing industries around us. My priority No. 1 (is) to make ourselves remain relevant.ALSO READ | Tech Mahindra bets on DAVID strategy to fuel growthSo, how are you making Tech Mahindra stay relevant? Can you also share what are, say, the three big bets for Tech Mahindra? I can tell you not three but five. First is cybersecurity. Second is imaging as a service or say, a service where we use automation platform with radiologist, and run imaging as a service. No. 3 is blockchain. No. 4 is that we want to be the largest system integrator in the Internet of things (IoT). No. 5 is network services, as the world moves towards last-mile connectivity, and focus on software-defined networks (increases).All IT firms are talking about these newer tech. When can we see Tech Mahindra beginning to disclose the business it generates from each of these five big bets?We should be able to do this soon. The way we look at it is that we will take 12-16 months to incubate them. So, out of the five, three will go into production phase. It is possible that not all five will go into production phase. And so, I believe that the three which go into production, it is my duty to report the numbers. I have invested shareholder money and I guess it is the right of the shareholders to know what I have done with their money. So, we should be able to report the revenue or business once it goes into production (phase) after 12-16 months.How different will the Tech Mahindra of 2020 be? Currently, 65% of my business comes from IT while balance comes from engineering services, network services, customer experience, platform and security. Im taking a forward call and saying 50% will come from IT and 50% will come from different platforms by 2020. So, obviously there will be changes.Your thoughts on the internal goal of becoming a $10 billion firm by 2020, and what percentage of revenue will be called digital by then? Will it be more than half of your revenue, as against the 15-7% currently? Will it mean significant revenue from M&A?I cannot comment on the Internal  goals. But on your question of digital revenue, I would say that the way market is moving, getting more than 50% you see is not relevant. Because if I get the topline, I promise you, we will have more than 50% (coming from) digital.One of the things which is often held against Indian heritage IT firms is that they are too conservative. You are talking about blockchain. But if you are serious, then why not launch a service line? Take a more aggressive approach like the one adopted by IBM, which has set up business focused on blockchain technologies.I cannot comment on what approach other companies are taking. Im not betting my company on any one technology. If you look at my company, 65% of business which comes from traditional IT will change to 50% by 2020. So, I will still get 50% from IT. So, Im not betting my whole ranch on this. blockchain for all you know will be $200 million practice, say, for us when Im $8 billion or $9 billion. So, are you saying that there is enough in traditional business?I am not saying this. All I am saying is that my companys focus remains and will be in solving business problems. I will choose the technology. Im not getting married to one technology. And that is the difference between service and product companies. Tech Mahindra is perceived to be lagging behind in digital technologies. It does not have a strong consultancy arm, for instance. You are wrong when you say I dont have a strong consultancy arm. I have about 3,000 consultants. I have probably what is the largest IT telecom services firm out of India being a leader for the last 10 years and I will be the leader for the next 10 years. From the positioning point of view, I have taken a position:  I will be largest IT  firm in the media, communication and entertainment industry.

0.22,"Ford Motor Co. on Tuesday said that it will invest $195 million (Rs1,300 crore) in Chennai to build a global technology and business centre that will serve as a hub for product development, mobility solutions and business services for India and other markets around the world. 
				   
				The centre will also house the companys largest information technology organization outside of the companys global headquarters. Mint had in October 2015 first reported about Fords plans to set up a global technology and business centre in India.India is not only a vibrant market for cars and new mobility ideas, it also is rich with talent, technical expertise and ingenuity, executive chairman Bill Ford said in a statement. This new center will help us attract the best and brightest, and make Chennai a true hub of innovation for Ford around the world. Once it gets completed in 2019, the centre will become Fords third global product development centre in Asia Pacific and part of Fords global product development network.It also will feature a wide range of laboratories and testing facilities for both full vehicles and components, enabling Ford to conduct extensive testing of future vehicles in India, the company said in a statement. However, Tuesdays announcement is unlikely to help Fords India operations immediately and the focus will be more on feeding into the Detroit-based companys global operations.Ford in India continues to struggle even after being present in the country for more than 20 years, in which the Indian market has changed drastically.In the six years between 2010-11 and 2015-16, the American car makers annual sales in India have grown only twice. Sales reached the highest at 98,537 units in 2010-11 because of the success of the Figo but they declined to 92,665 units and 77,225 units in 2011-12 and 2012-13, respectively. Sales grew in 2013-14 and fell in 2014-15 only to rise again in 2015-16, albeit on a smaller base. During the same period, the Indian passenger vehicle market expanded from 2.52 million units to 2.78 million.In recent times, the companys second generation Figo failed to receive the kind of response that the previous one did. Ford did create a new compact SUV segment with the EcoSport, but it failed to capitalize on the first-mover advantage. The segment is now dominated by market leader Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Hyundai Motor India Ltd. Ford, along with Volkswagen India Pvt. Ltd, was the last one to enter the sub-four-metre sedan category but demand in the segment has waned, which meant lukewarm response for the American car makers Figo Aspire.In pursuit of making its business sustainable, the company has changed tack and shifted focus to exports, which grew 41.37% to 55,821 units between April and September.Indias overall car exports grew 3.89% to 319,579 units.In the new centre in Chennai, the company will hire 3,000 skilled workers over the next five years. Ford also will consolidate 9,000 employees from six existing facilities in Chennai on the 28-acre campus, the company said in a statement.Ford has invested over $2 billion in India to set up two plants, one each in Chennai and Sanand in Gujarat.

1.0,"Bengaluru: Abidali Neemuchwala completes a year on 1 February as Wipro Ltds chief executive officer (CEO). The former Tata Consultancy Services Ltd veteran, who joined Wipro as chief operating officer (COO) in April 2015, remains confident that by the end of March 2018, Wipro will be able to come back to industry-matching growth.
ALSO READ | Wipro revenue forecast underlines IT industrys challengesOver his 20 months at Wipro, Neemuchwala, who is based in Dallas, has focused on simplifying internal processes, worked on organization alignment to improve execution, embraced hyper automation and adopted an aggressive mergers and acquisitions approach. The measures have helped Wipro marginally improve upon the 3.7% dollar revenue growth recorded in 2015-16, which is  expected to grow at-best 5% in the year ending March. Edited excerpts from an interview:Three full quarters as CEO, and you have embarked on a journey by articulating six broad themes. Given these measures you have started, the management has said in the past that a complete turnaround will take time. Will it be fair to ask if the company can come back or say end March 2018 with industry-matching growth or Nasscom-projected growth numbers? How would you describe this quarter?Operationally, it was a good quarter. Our profitability improved in a quarter where there are furloughs and fewer working days. But I think in revenue growth we could have done more. But core business is doing well. India and Middle East business restructuring (had an impact) and Appirio (acquisition) closing also took time. So these things aside, Im very confident that Wipro is progressing well and I believe three-four quarters is a reasonable time frame (when we will come back to Industry-leading growth). You need all cylinders to be firing for industry-leading growth and that is what Im focusing on. One criticism of your 20-month stint, first as COO and then the 10 months as CEO, is that you have shied away from taking tough decisions when it comes to making or appointing leaders. Analysts believe you have continued with the same set of leaders. One of the things which is part of my nature is that we dont advertise tough decisions. As a CEO, you take tough decisions all the time. About 40% of my current leadership team, from direct reporting structure, is not what I inherited from T.K. Kurien. We have new leadership where ever it is required. (What) Im also very sensitive about is that whenever these changes happen, we do it very respectfully and consciously. So we dont make changes for the heck of making changes. In fact, I feel very good that if you as a journalist dont see this change, then customers also dont see this change. And this is the best thing for us. Remember, we have had a very smooth CEO transition, or rather the smoothest in the industry. Do you think there is a lot of noise on visa regulation in the US and Indian companies dependence on visas is actually coming down?Absolutely. The industry, including Wipro, has learnt to hire globally, many more local employees. Rebadged a lot of employees from our customers. Today I guide my hiring managers that dont make overseas job posting as an attraction. That era is over. So today I tell young talent that if you want to do great digital and path breaking and domain focused work, join Wipro. So dependence on visa has absolutely come down over the last few years. And so it is not that much of a worry because we believe that all business friendly decisions will be taken by the US government. What are say two challenges ahead of you, as you start calendar year 2017?Strategically, we have to future-proof our organization. So execution here will be key. Our exposure to telecoms and energy in the past had its impact. So balancing the whole portfolio takes time. We have to configure our business that we are diversified enough so that cyclical changes do not have more than impact.Now India and Middle East is creating new opportunities. Historically, we have had challenges. So we plan to complete in two quarters. So we hope to complete by Q1 of next financial year. All this is apart from continuing to make our mergers integrate well and continuing with our six-pillar strategy.",2017-01-26,2Jb7ZhgprpY3XgjU6wibJN,"Wipro CEO Abidali Neemuchwala says operationally, the December quarter was  good for the firm but revenue growth could have been better",01:08,Wipro will be back to industry-matching growth in 3-4 quarters: CEO Abidali Neemuchwala
0.96,"Bengaluru: Titan Co Ltd, a Tata group firm that makes watches and jewellery, reported a 23.51% year-on-year increase in net profit to Rs180.76 crore in the September quarter as it benefited from cost cuts, improved margins and festive season sales.
				   
				Titans revenue fell marginally by 0.1% to Rs2,659.83 crore during the period.In April, Titan announced a voluntary retirement scheme for employees who had either finished 10 years of service or were above 40 years of age in a bid to improve productivity and cut costs. The move appears to have paid off in terms of profit growth.Gross margins were very good during the quarter. We are at 42% studded ratio and that added to the margin substantially. Another fact is also that in plain gold jewellery our margins were significantly higher thanks to the higher gold prices, senior executives at Titan including CEO (jewellery) C.K. Venkataraman, told analysts in a conference call on Friday.Still, both net profit and sales missed Street expectations of Rs192.20 crore and Rs 3,040.20 crore, respectively, based on a survey of analysts by Bloomberg.Net sales at its jewellery and eye-wear segments, and other businesses, including precision engineering and accessories, grew while revenue from watches declined from year-ago period.This was an extremely good quarter for the company,  with respect to profit. All businesses of the firm recorded profits in the quarter. The jewellery business had an extremely good studded jewellery activation and the watches business launched its second smart watch, JUXT Pro, Bhaskar Bhat, managing director of Titan, said in a BSE filing on Friday.In a BSE filing in early October, Titan had warned that studded jewellery sales had surpassed its expectations in the September quarter but volatile gold prices and low consumer confidence had dented sales of gold jewellery.That, perhaps, explains why revenue from the companys jewellery segment, run under the Tanishq brand, grew just 0.24% year-on-year in the quarter to Rs1,987.51 crore.Revenue from this segment typically accounts for a major chunk of overall sales.For the Dussehra to Diwali festive period, Tanishq registered a growth of 39% over last year, Bhat said in the filing.On Friday, Titans shares ended at Rs368.50 on the BSE, down 2.16% from the previous close while Indias benchmark Sensex Index fell 0.57% to close at 27274.15 points.",2016-11-04,2cANNdBicJMP0Nx2QCbX1H,"Titans second-quarter revenue, however, fell marginally by 0.1% to Rs2,659.83 crore ",15:44,"Titan Q2 profit rises 23.5% on improved margins, cost-cutting measures "

-0.04,"Last month, The Economist published a story on the Tata group with the title Mistrys Elephant, where the magazine compared the conglomerate to a ponderous pachyderm.
				   
				In what now appears to be a remarkably prescient remark, the magazine said, That the revered Mr (Ratan) Tata still chairs the Trusts that bear his name may make it trickier for Mr (Cyrus) Mistry to be his own man.Was Mistrys performance so bad that he had to be removed? The Street seems to think otherwise.One obvious yardstick is the market capitalization of the group. On 1 January 2013, soon after Mistry took charge, the market capitalization of listed companies of the Tata group was Rs4.97 trillion. On Monday, when the decision was announced, the market capitalization stood at Rs8.71 trilliona massive 75% higher in less than four years.The Tata groups increase in market capitalization beats benchmarks such as the Nifty, which has risen 47% and big groups such as Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) with a market capitalization growth of 27% in the same period. Of course, one cannot ignore the market cap of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), one of the groups premium firms that spews  cash, alone is higher than that of RIL. And it does paper over the fact that many of the group companies are not doing so well. But, on key return ratios such as return on equity, the groups leading firms are on par with peers. As far as revenue goes, compounded revenue growth between FY13 and FY16 of TCS, Tata Motors Ltd (led by Jaguar Land Rover Plc) and even Indian Hotels Corp. Ltd have outperformed their peers.ALSO READ | Cyrus Mistry removed as Tata Sons chairman, Ratan Tata returnsYes, there were some bad eggs in the basket. For instance, Tata Steel Ltds acquisition of European steel giant Corus was sinking under its own weight. But its performance has perhaps more to do with the severe cyclical downturn in commodities, with global players bleeding and shutting down plants.Tata Docomo likewise was caught in a long-drawn and bitter legal tussle, the genesis of which predated Mistrys taking charge.If anything, media reports suggest Mistry was trying to put the vast and diversified conglomerate in order. He put Coruss steel assets in the UK on the block and took firm steps to sell off assets of the non-performing businesses of Indian Hotels and Tata Chemicals. There were also reports that he was telling managers to pull up their socks. At the Tata Motors annual general meeting on 9 August, Mistry was reported to have said, I think the journey is going to be long and not for the faint-hearted.ALSO READ | Uneasy lies the Tata crownIn any case, analysts and industry experts say that four years is too short a time period to judge Mistrys performance by or even compare it with that of Ratan Tata, who was at the helm unfettered for three decades. It may also be a trifle unfair to hold Mistry responsible as chairman for the weak performance of some of the companies in his group, considering that he inherited massive problems.Clearly, Mistry was attempting to change the course of the ship, with a sharper focus on shareholder value. Unfortunately, he was not very communicative about his plans.What impact will the announcement have on Tata group shares? It is now up to the board to take immediate steps to restore investor confidence.

Cognizant had initially forecast revenue growth of between 10% and 14% for the year ending 31 December.The latest reduction of its revenue forecast signals tougher times ahead for the outsourcing sector.

-0.96,"Mumbai: Tata Steel Ltd on Friday said it swung to a loss in the quarter ended 30 September, hurt by weak operations in the United Kingdom.
				   
				The steel maker reported a consolidated net loss of Rs49.38 crore for the quarter, compared with a net profit of Rs5,609.43 crore a year ago. Net sales edged up 0.2% to Rs27,392.06 crore from Rs27,339.37 crore a year earlier.Fifteen analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected Tata Steel to report a consolidated net profit of Rs712.3 crore, while 16 analysts had expected sales of Rs27,334.70 crore.India business revenue rose 10.1% to Rs11,718.31 crore. Revenue at Tata Steel Europe fell 13.7% to Rs12,357.69 crore. Finance costs in the quarter rose 22.8% to Rs1,351.06 crore.The company said that its deliveries in the September quarter stood at 5.65 million tonnes.Tata Steel has been grappling with rising shipments from China, where an economic slowdown has depressed demand and put steel prices under pressure.Over the past year, Tata Steel has cut jobs and shuttered some of its plants in Europe, blaming cheap Chinese imports, a strong pound and high costs for its decision.Tata Sons Ltds ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry had played a key role in discussions about merging Tata Steels European operations with those of Thyssenkrupp AG. Tata Steel said it is still involved in discussions with the German company for a potential joint venture and that the process of selling Tata Steel UKs speciality steels business and its Hartlepool pipe mills are ongoing.Tata Steel UK is deeply engaged with all relevant stakeholders in the UK including the unions, the pension trustees and the pension regulators to find a structural solution and a way forward with regards to the affordability of the legacy pension scheme liabilities. Discussions are currently ongoing, the company said in a statement.Strong monsoons affected steel demand across the country while the increase in domestic capacity added to the competitive pressure... There was a sharp drop in realizations which coupled with the ramp-up costs at the Kalinganagar plant kept margins under pressure. While realizations have since improved, rising coal prices will affect margins in the short run and will necessitate increase in steel realizations going forward, said T.V. Narendran, managing director of Tata Steel India and South-East Asia.In March, Tata Steel decided to put its entire UK business on the block in the face of a slump in steel demand and prices, but the plan hit a roadblock due to uncertainty stemming from Britains decision to exit the European Union.The group eventually halted the sale process in July in favour of discussions for a joint venture with strategic players in the steel industry, including Thyssenkrupp.As of 30 September, Tata Steels net debt stood at Rs75,563 crore.Overall numbers were below expectations. India business was weak due to Kalinganagar impacting the overall mix and the Europe margin rise was not as expected. The other divisions also did not perform well. For the next two-thirds quarters, Kalinganagar will continue to impact negatively.

0.24,"Amid all manner of disclosures, some quite unsavoury, in the Cyrus Mistry vs. Ratan Tata battle, the one silver lining has been how neither camp has accused the other of personal excesses. So while Mistry has suggested the groups pursuit of a small car for the Indian middle class was no more than a personal fancy of Tata and should be wound up, the accusation never extended to how the man who ran the group for over 20 years went and splurged on a gold plated Rolls Royce for himself. 
				   
				Indeed, till the time Tata Motors Ltd bought Jaguar Land Rover, the group owner would often squeeze himself into one of the more plebian cars the company made.In truth, most of Indias company owners and founders have conservative lifestyles with few of the wild and exotic indulgences that we associate with the billionaire lifestyle across the world. Sample this: in January 2014, the Dallas Safari Club, a hunters rights organization, auctioned off a permit which would allow the holder to travel to Namibia for the chance to kill one of only 5,000 surviving black rhinos. The auction was won by oil heir and Texas hunter Corey Knowlton, who bid $350,000 for that dubious right.It isnt the kind of thing that Tata or Kumar Mangalam Birla or Mukesh Ambani, or a dozen other Indian tycoons are likely to be doing on their summer breaks. Despite their obvious wealth, their sensibilities seem no different from that of many well-brought-up middle-class Indians of an earlier era. That shows even in the way most behave with people around them. Thus, Tata will often hold the elevator door open at Bombay House when he sees an executive rushing towards it and by all accounts Mistry is a chip off the same block.Dilip Shanghvi, founder of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and the countrys richest billionaire by some rankings, is low-key to a fault. Fortis Healthcare Ltd co-founders Malvinder and Shivinder Singh may be in the best-dressed lists of social magazines, but you are unlikely to find Prathap Reddy, founder of Apollo Hospitals or Y.K. Hamied, chairman of Cipla Ltd, displaying any sartorial vanities.Most of them dress simply, wearing suits only for meetings and even those tend to be the kind that will hardly attract attention. Tata, in fact, seems to have dropped his jacket of late, appearing in his shirt sleeves at most of the acrimonious annual general meetings of his group companies over the last few months. Clearly they are not following the example of UK-based billionaire Scott Alexander, dubbed the Vainest Man in Britain, who likes to buy out entire clothes collections, rather than just certain pieces. One year he spent £300,000 on clothes from Dolce & Gabbana.At meetings to discuss strategic plans for his group, Ajay Piramal munches on such frugal fare as khakra while Reliance Industries Ltd chairman Mukesh Ambanis fondness for vada paav is legendary. Contrast their gastronomical conservatism with that of Sean Parker, co-founder of Napster, who is known to have spent $13,000 on a single meal.Indias IT billionaires are of course in a class of their own in terms of frugality. Azim Premji, once Indias richest man, whose stake in Wipro Ltd. is worth nearly $15 billion, would often take an auto rickshaw from the old airport in Bengaluru and once threw a mini fit when he was automatically upgraded from his regular economy class seat on a Kingfisher flight to Delhi.The others, Infosys founders N.R. Narayana Murthy, Nandan Nilekani and the reclusive Shiv Nadar who set up HCL Technologies Ltd, are no different. The latters one indulgence is his Zen garden, on which he showers attentions. How utterly boring, when compared to Australian billionaire Clive Palmer, who got himself a $600 million replica of the Titanic, or another billionaire who recently ordered a diamond and gold encrusted collar for his pet dog.Of course, Indias billionaire class has its honourable exceptions and the latest gizmo or car eventually does find its way to Indian shores. But these are few, and their excesses still raise an eyebrow.",2017-01-03,4fi8FzAKiTzjZRLgF6H9LM,Most of Indias company owners and founders have conservative lifestylescontrary to exotic indulgences that are associated with the billionaire lifestyle across the world,14:47,Indias middle-class billionaires
-0.55,"Singapore: This weeks putsch at Tata Sons has already served one useful purpose. While its been clear for a while that something wasnt quite right at the $100 billion Indian empire, the chairmans surprise ouster has made it possible to start asking questions about strategy (or lack of it) at a conglomerate that traces its roots to the American civil war.
				   
				Did the newly dumped Cyrus Mistry fail to plant enough saplings of growth? Or did Ratan Tata, who gave Mistry the job only to take it back four years later, not want to face reality? Are some of the businesses he acquired now covered in weeds, compelling Mistry to trim the outgrowth of debt?The answers will be important for investors in the groups publicly traded units, who, at present, have no idea how the coup at the holding company will affect them.Letting Tata vs. Mistry play out in public is a delicious idea. With the Economic Times leaking the contents of an unhappy email purportedly written by Mistry to the Tata Sons board and owners, and at least one of those shareholders giving a TV interview on what they disliked about the Mistry regime, the slugfest has begun. Its time to pour a cup of (Tata-owned) Tetley tea, and settle down.Also Read: Tata Sons dividend payout steady for last decadeV.R. Mehta, a trustee at one of the philanthropic organizations that collectively own roughly two-thirds of Tata Sons, is right to argue that under Mistry, the dividends from group companies have become increasingly reliant on just two businesses  Jaguar Land Rover, one of Ratan Tatas most audacious acquisitions, and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., the software export unit.But to what extent is Mistry responsible? In the letter attributed to him by the Economic Times, the ousted chairman claimed that it was Ratan Tatas 2009 decision to buy a property in suburban Mumbai  in disuse since a 1993 bomb attack  that led to Indian Hotels Co.s entire net worth getting wiped out. The companys last big profit, of $115 million, was in 2008.Then again, a year after Ratan Tata bought Corus Group Plc in 2006, Tata Steel went on to earn an annual profit of almost $3 billion. A China-led global steel glut has turned that profit into a loss of $1 billion over the past four quarters, with Mistry warning in his letter of a potential $10 billion impairment of European steel assets.Tata Steels loss in past 4 quartersMistry cant shift all the blame to his predecessor. While Ratan Tatas non-JLR car investments have mostly flopped, Mistrys problem was not having enough big ideas of his own. He may not have been the one to sink the wireless telecom unit, but he did precious little to revive it. He could also have handled the ugly spat with NTT Docomo Inc., the partner in that business, a lot better.Also Read: Ratan Tata seeks to rally group firms after Cyrus Mistry ousterThe Tata Group has survived two world wars, nationalization of its prized airline by a socialist-minded government and other tribulations. But the damage to the groups reputation for fair dealing is probably Mistrys biggest failing as chairman.That failure has consequences. In Singapore, bond investors are scratching their heads over a dollar-denominated perpetual bond issue by Tata International Ltd. The debt of this thinly capitalized company will derive its value from implicit support by the Tata group. A few years ago, it would have been preposterous to suggest that the Tatas would stake their reputation to save $1.17 billion  the amount the group is seeking to avoid paying in the Docomo dispute. Its worrisome if investors are no longer sure whether the group will even back a $150 million to $200 million bond issue. A no-holds-barred airing of differences between Mistry and Ratan Tata may help reestablish just what it is that shareholders of Tata Sons want their group to stand for. That will be the cherry on the cake from this entertaining spectacle  to be washed down with that Tetley tea, of course.

0.1,"Seoul: Billionaire Shin Dong-joo has reason to be bitter. In the past couple of years, hes been suspended by his father, fired by his younger brother and indicted on charges of embezzlement by South Korean prosecutors.
				   
				Yet the former No. 2 at Lotte Group says hes confident hell clear his name in court, overthrow his brother as chairman and seize control of a business empire that generates more revenue than Google Inc. or Airbus Group. His plan is to take advantage of the groups complex network of more than 70 cross shareholdings. If he can gain the votes of minority shareholders in one Japanese unit that binds the whole conglomerate together, he says he can effectively control the group.My final target is to take control of Lotte, Shin, 62, said in his office in Seoul in his first interview with foreign media. My brother and the current management destroyed (Lottes) good corporate culture.Shin is attempting to pull off a unique coup in Korean corporate historythe takeover of one of the countrys giant family-run business groups, known as the chaebol. If he succeeds, hell take charge of the nations largest chain of shopping malls, duty-free stores, hotels and amusement parks, one whose overseas assets include Guylian Belgian chocolates and New Yorks Palace Hotel. ALSO READ: Lotte scraps $4.5 billion hotel IPO as probes deepen crisisCoup attemptsIts a big if. His brother Shin Dong-bin, chairman of Lotte Group, outguns him in terms of resources and has already fended off numerous coup attempts. The brothers given names will be used in this article for clarity.No coup has ever succeeded among the chaebol, said Chung Sun-sup, CEO of Chaebul.com, a website that tracks the chaebol. He said Dong-joos best chance would be if his brother was convicted as a result of the investigation this year into corruption at the company. Dong-joo has also been charged but both brothers deny the allegations. Meanwhile, the family feud is hurting Lotte and has added another stain to the embattled reputation of the chaebol groups this year, which have already suffered the bankruptcy of Hanjin Shipping Co., Samsung Electronics Co.s exploding phones and an influence-peddling scandal that cost President Park Geun-hye her job.The battle at Lotte is among the fiercest corporate power struggles in Asia -- rivaling the brawl raging atop Indias Tata Group -- as some of the regions biggest dynasties undergo a once-in-a-generation leadership change.Lotte was founded seven decades ago by Shin Kyuk-ho in Japan, where he had earlier attended Waseda University. He started out selling chewing gum and built a business empire in Japan and Korea. The two brothers grew up together in Japan, with the elder learning to run the Japanese units and the younger taking charge of the Korean part.The trouble began when the ailing patriarch, now 94, fired his eldest son Dong-joo in January 2015 and took away some of his voting rights. Dong-joo says he was removed because the president of Lotte Holdings, Takayuki Tsukuda, falsely told his father that he was responsible for causing losses. Dong-joo said the accusations were part of a plan to wrest control of the company.Fathers forgivenessThe first thing for me to do was to persuade my father about the real situation, Dong-joo said. It took several months to change his mind.He did. In July 2015, the patriarch flew to Tokyo to overturn the dismissal but was thwarted when Dong-bin, Tsukuda and Chief Financial Officer Masamoto Kobayashi refused to meet him, according to a copy of testimony Dong-joo gave to Korean prosecutors earlier this year. The next day, the trio called an emergency board meeting and ousted the groups founder as the head of Lotte Holdings.Lotte Holdings declined to comment on any of the ousted executives allegations and wouldnt make Tsukuda or Kobayashi available for comment.Lotte Group said in a statement to Bloomberg News that Dong-joo was fired because he made unauthorized investments in a software venture that led to about 1 billion yen ($8.7 million) in losses. Lotte Chairman Dong-bin, 61, wasnt available for an interview, the group said.To insist one should be able to reclaim the company just because hes the owners son shows he has an outdated perspective and sees the company as a personal belonging Lotte said. Dong-joo is remorseless and lacks managerial competence, according to the statement.China expansionDong-joo said his brother is the one who is shortsighted. Dong-bin should be blamed for changing Lottes culture to one where managers constantly fear getting fired, he said. He also blamed Dong-bins expansion in China for what he estimated to be 2.4 trillion won ($2.1 billion) in losses for the group.The best players come to China and fight like at the Olympics, Dong-joo said in an interview in the Gran Seoul building, a block away from Lottes headquarters in the South Korean capital. The current management team underestimated the situation. Timeline of events that have roiled Lottes Shin familyLotte couldnt confirm the amount of the China losses. It said that Dong-bin is a proven leader who increased the groups annual sales to about 90 trillion won, from 26 trillion won in 2004, and pushed for the listing of Lotte Shopping Co. to enhance transparency. The chairman has a strategy to enhance group transparency and become a better corporate citizen, it said.As to Dong-joo, his strategy centers around Lotte Holdings Co., the closely held Tokyo-based company that owns about 99% of Hotel Lotte Co., which in turn controls the conglomerates scores of businesses in Korea. He argues that the best way to improve the groups governance issues would be a public share sale of the holding company.Dong-joo commands 33.3% of votes at Lotte Holdings, theoretically giving him a larger say than the 22.3% directly controlled by the Japanese executives. But there is also a 31% block of shares owned by 130 employees that is represented by a single union delegate whos been siding with Dong-bin. Should the delegates vote be broken up, Dong-joo said he could get the majority he needs.Dong-joo declined to specify how hed change the employee voting system, which was set up by his father decades ago, but said there are legal steps that his team is working on. His supporters include Min Euoo-sung, 62, the former Korea Development Bank chairman who placed a failed bid for Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. before its bankruptcy, and Cho Moon-hyun, an attorney at DW Partners.Lotte said the employee union sided with Dong-bin in light of his managerial skills, while Dong-joo should be ashamed of losing the support of the Lotte Holdings staff. Union representatives werent available to comment.Dong-joo says his brother is only a pawn in a battle being controlled by Tsukuda and Kobayashi. As he tells it, the majority of votes at Lotte Holdings are effectively controlled by the Japanese executives as his younger brother only holds 1.6% of the voting rights.They can fire my brother anytime, Dong-joo said. My brothers position is not stable. While the brothers feud rages, Lotte is facing other crises.Corruption indictmentsIn October, South Korean prosecutors indicted five members of the family, including both brothers and their father, after a four-month investigation, accusing the Shin clan of engaging in financial crimes amounting to almost 280 billion won. Dong-joo was also charged with embezzling 39 billion won, which he denies. Lotte Group said most of the allegations against his brother, Dong-bin, involve events during the time their father was running the group. Other family members could not be reached for comment.Separately, Dong-bin had to answer allegations from parliament, along with other chaebol leaders, that Lotte and the other big business groups gave bribes to foundations controlled by Choi Soon-sil, the confidante of impeached Korean President Parkaccusations Dong-bin and Lotte Group deny.The scandals have taken a toll on Lottes businesses. The company scrapped a potential $4.5 billion initial public offering of a hotel unit and withdrew a multi-billion-dollar bid for chemicals-maker Axiall Corp. Prior to its deals freeze, Lotte was the most active Korean conglomerate in terms of mergers and acquisitions over the past six years, according to corporate watchdog CEOScore.For Dong-joo, the crises at Lotte are representative of what he says are managements missteps. He says he has a message for his estranged brother, with whom he hasnt spoken in months. Youd better apologize to my father and come back to Shin family, Dong-joo said. As a family, we should be united. BloombergGrace Huang also contributed to this story.",2016-12-16,644n0DkZZlIjzpFHzGm9bN,"Billionaire Shin Dong-joo says hes confident hell clear his name in court, overthrow his brother as chairman and seize control of Lotte Group that generates more revenue than Google or Airbus ",18:58,Inside a banished Korean billionaires plot to overthrow his brother

				The latter was a wig, and the former was just bad science fiction packaged by consultants as a $600 billion hair-raiser. But Dewang Mehta, the chief lobbyist for Indias fledgling software services industry, carried off both with aplomb, convincing businesses that at the stroke of midnight of the new millennium, their computer systems would crash because old programs measured years in two digits instead of four. The solution, he persuaded them, was to let a horde of techies from Bangalore and Hyderabad go through each line of code and fix the Y2K bug. That was the birth of Indias massively successful software services industry, which died on Friday after a short battle with newer digital technologies. At the time of its demise, the business was worth $110 billion in annual export revenue.The first hint that the end was near came on Thursday when Tata Consultancy Services, the biggest Indian software vendor by market value, announced a virtual stalling of its business in the September quarter from the previous three months. After Infosys followed up by slashing its full-year revenue guidance for the second time in three months, it was time to turn off the ventilator.Infosys revenue growth pre-LehmanA coroners inquiry unearthed three signs of decay, the first of which shows how Indian companies cheap-talent-fueled growth ran out of breath. In the four quarters before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Infosys saw revenue increase an average 29% in constant-currency terms. Back then, Dublin-based Accentures growth was just half as high. But theres nothing exceptional about Indian companies expansion anymore. All that investors have heard from managements this year is gloomy commentary on how challenging its become to get clients to open their wallets. When the companies do make news nowadays, its more often for dodgy business practices, regulatory slaps on the wrist, and senior-level exits.A slowdown alone wouldnt have stopped the Indian industry if it had been able to embrace smac, or social, mobile, analytics and cloud-based technologies. But the vendors wasted so much time defending their legacy business of writing code for and maintaining purpose-built enterprise applications that they failed to make a mark in the new digital world. As an analysis from  Mint shows, the dominant trio of Tata Consultancy, Infosys and Wipro between them had 1.5 times more workers doing digital stuff last year than Accenture. But the revenue they garnered was 40% less than what the latter chalked up from newer technologies. That makes the typical digital-tech employee of an Indian vendor 25% as efficient as his counterpart at the global consultant. This gap sets the clock back on Indian companies, which have taken years to narrow the productivity differential:Maybe its just banking clients and their inability to pay like they once did. Or perhaps its a combination of weak global growth, Brexit, protectionism and Donald Trumps vacillating stance on US visas for Indian technology workers. Hoping that turbulence is temporary, investors are still paying a hefty premium for future growth. They may get lucky for a while. Still, a dead-cat bounce from delayed orders coming through would hardly count as proof of life.The millennium scare got Indian software a foot in the door at global corporations. But now the shoe is on the other foot. Robotics and artificial intelligence are putting the vendors labour-intensive business at risk of obsolescence. Even if the concern is as puffed up as Y2K, with plenty of growth candidates in the Indian start-up world, at least for some investors it may be time to back new horses rather than flog dead ones.

				The Times of India said on Monday that Tech Mahindra Ltd is leading the race and is contemplating an offer that is at a 20% premium to the recent market price of Mphasis.Its true that a 20% premium to the current market price will be an aggressive offer. But its a bit premature for minority shareholders of Mphasis to get excited. This is because any decent offer will be possible only if HP sweetens the deal for the acquirer.As things stand, about a fourth of the companys revenue comes via HP, and it is declining at a fast pace. In the December quarter, revenue from the HP channel fell by almost 12% quarter-on-quarter. Five years ago, this business had an annual revenue run rate of $700 million; it has now fallen to around $220 million, based on the December quarter revenue. At this rate, the business will soon disappear. It doesnt make sense for any acquirer to pay a premium, unless HP provides some surety for providing business to Mphasis for at least three-five years. This may well be in HPs interest as well, as a decent- enough premium will help HP garner nearly $1 billion from the sale. But, of course, this cant be taken for granted. HP also has a wholly-owned subsidiary in India, which appears to have been a larger beneficiary of its offshoring efforts in recent years. As far as Tech Mahindras interest in the company goes, Mphasis, with its large exposure to the banking and financial services sector, will be a good fit. This is a segment where Tech Mahindra has lagged behind peers, and the acquisition will increase its scale in the business to a respectable $1 billion.But having said that, the risk of paying too much and merger integration issues are areas of concern. Analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd say in an 8 February note, One of the key things a buyer would look at when considering MPHL is the margin that it makes in the Direct Channel versus HP channel... Based on our calculation, direct channel Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margins could be around 11% (nearly half of the HP Channel Ebit margins of around 20%).In most of the recent deals in the IT (information technology) services space, the target companies have had margins of around 20% and their portfolios have been far more diversified. As such, theres hardly any reason for paying a high premium for Mphasis over comparable deals such as iGate Corp.s acquisition of Patni Computer Systems Ltd.It seems the only way HP can extract good value is to commit to certain revenues via the HP channel for the next few years.

Analysts have used them to view global spending on those invisible lines of computer code that enable large corporations to run themselves. No longer. The picture the duo are displaying now is more about how their own industry is at risk of being overrun by robots.Infosys operating margin 
Before last quarters results, Infosys was doing a relatively better job of gaining investor approval. This time last year, TCS shares enjoyed a 15% higher valuation than Infosys, based on analysts expectations of future earnings. By this week, that had turned into a small discount.Then on Thursday, TCS beat revenue and profit estimates for the June quarter, but operating margins shrank to 25%. Thats below the managements targeted range of 26% to 28%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Infosys, which reported on Friday, cut its sales forecast for the year. Worse still, its operating margin came in at just 24.1%, extending a nearly four-year decline in relative profitability for the Bangalore-based group.Two years ago, Infosys tapped SAP executive Vishal Sikka to take over from the founders, who all seemed bent on having a go at running the company before retirement. For a while, it looked like they might run it aground. But while Infosys has steadied under Sikka, its increasingly clear that the new normal for operating margins for both Infosys and TCS may be around 25%, and not the 29% to 31% that at least Infosys used to hit fairly regularly before its management merry-go-around left it dizzy.Profitability is now capped by robots, or, to be more specific, a combination of artificial intelligence, digital technologies, blockchain and other innovations that are challenging the traditional strategy of throwing people at complex software problems and charging clients for their time. But while the large Indian vendors are themselves investing in these new areas, so much of their legacy business depends on exploiting the price difference between techies in the West and in developing countries, its not clear if theyll be able to switch to a people-lite business model in time.For the top four Indian vendors, growth in total employment has slowed to 8% levels, from 106% in the year ended in March 2012. But nimbler challengers are threatening to nibble at juicy businesses faster than the Indian companies can slim down. For instance, UK-based start-up Thought Machine has created a new, blockchain-based core banking package that resides in the cloud and wont require expensive in-house data centers, according to a report this week in Artificial Intelligence Online. TCS has made two acquisitions of more than $500 million in value, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. The last was in 2014. Infosys hasnt done any of that size with its $5 billion in cash. TCS fell as much as 3.8% in Mumbai on Friday, while Infosys slumped almost 11%. The relative performance of the two is no longer much of an investment theme. Of far greater importance is how they take on those robots. Bloomberg

0.61,"San Francisco: Facebook Inc.s revenue topped analysts projections, boosted by video advertising and sales from Instagram. 
				   
				Third-quarter sales of the Mark Zuckerberg-led social media giant grew 56% to $7.01 billion, the company said Wednesday in a statement. That compared with analysts average estimate of $6.92 billion. The company drew 84% of its advertising revenue from mobile phones, unchanged from the prior quarter. Its the sixth straight quarterly revenue beat for Facebook, which has increased sales by more than 50% the past four quarters. As the company expands into new areas like virtual reality and mobile messaging, its consistent performance is tied to its main advertising business on mobile phones. Facebook expanded that business to Instagram, its photo-sharing application, which has started to contribute to the growth. So long as the core business remains as strong as it is, the overall thesis doesnt change muchthey have a ton of opportunity, Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie Securities, said before the earnings report. Mobile just continues to absolutely dominate for them. Gain in usersThe company increased its monthly active users 4.7% from the previous quarter to 1.79 billion, topping analysts estimates of 1.76 billion. Daily users rose to 1.18 billion. The company doesnt break out Instagrams sales, but the apps advertising revenue is growing faster than for Facebooks main product, David Wehner, the chief financial officer, said in an interview. Still, Facebooks app was the bigger contributor to sales growth in the quarter, he said. Its the continued strength of advertiser demand, Wehner said of what drove the quarter. Were seeing strength across all geographies, market segments and verticals. Facebook, based in Menlo Park, California, was unchanged in extended trading, after declining 1.8% to close at $127.17 in New York. The shares have increased 22% this year. Investment areasChief executive officer Zuckerberg is taking advantage of Facebooks blockbuster ad growth to spend in other areas, like virtual reality and connecting the world to the Internetbets that may not contribute to financial performance for a decade or two. Meanwhile, in addition to Instagram, the company has two chat apps, Messenger and WhatsApp, with more than 1 billion users each. Facebook is testing models for making money from the properties, such as letting users talk to businesses to book trips or send flowers. The company is driving the growth in digital advertising spending, along with Alphabet Inc.s Google. The companies captured 68% of digital ad spend in the first half of this year, an increase from 61% a year ago, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a non-profit industry group.The two companies are capturing the equivalent to all of the growth in the industry and then some, leaving crumbs for everyone else to fight for, said Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group. Its kind of boring at this point. Profit, excluding some items, was $1.09 a share, compared with analysts estimates of 97 cents. The company reported net income of $2.38 billion, or 82 cents a share, from $896 million, or 31 cents, a year earlier.

0.9,"Ousted Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry was pushing C. Sivasankaran, who had played dealmaker in several Tata group transactions in the past, to pay up the Siva groups share of the DoCoMo award, and also discussed with the board of the holding company possible legal action against the sometimes controversial, Seychelles-based entrepreneur, documents seen by Mint show.
				   
				On 15 September, at his penultimate Tata Sons board meeting as chairman, Mistry raised this issue, the documents show. He was removed as chairman when the board next met on 24 October.Interestingly, on 19 September, Tata Sons (Tata Teleservices Ltd and NTT DoCoMo Inc. are named as co-respondents) received a legal notice from a firm retained by Sivasankarans Sterling Info-tech Ltd, alleging mismanagement of Tata Teleservices and reserving the right to seek damages to recover its (Sterlings) losses.Mint learns that a decision on how to respond to this email had not been taken till Mistrys exit.Tata group spokesperson Debasis Ray said in an email response to Mints queries that in 2008, when Docomo agreed to acquire shares of Tata Teleservices, Tata Sons voluntarily offered other shareholders of TTSL an opportunity for a pro-rata sale of their holdings. This was subject to the shareholders agreeing to bear a pro-rata portion of any claims or amounts payable to Docomo should such an event arise.... Thereafter in 2014, Docomo exercised the put option. In terms of the agreement with the selling shareholders, Tata Sons demanded from Mr Sivasankaran his pro-rata share of the amount payable to Docomo.Ray added that Tata Sons is pursuing all legal options for recovery of this amount.Mint couldnt ascertain whether the company had responded to Sivasankarans notice. Sivasankaran could not be reached for comment immediately.The notice from Sivasankarans law firm mentions his long-standing association with the Tata Group of Companies on account of his close association with Mr Ratan Tata.Sivasankaran has had several dealings with the group, taking Barista, Indias first coffee chain that the Tata group had acquired, off its hands, selling Dishnet DSL to the Tata-owned VSNL, which subsequently became Tata Communications, and facilitating the sale of the Tata stake in the Birla-Tata-AT&T telecom venture to the Aditya Birla Group, resulting in the formation of Idea Cellular Ltd.In early 2006, the Siva group acquired 520 million shares in Tata Teleservices at Rs 17 per share or Rs884 crore. It paid Rs102 crore towards this, the documents show. It paid the balance in February 2006. Of the Rs782 crore, the documents show that Rs650 crore was funded by a loan from Standard Chartered Bank effectively guaranteed by Tata Sons. The balance Rs132 crore came from Kalimati Investments, a subsidiary of Tata Steel.Ray confirmed both and said that to ensure that in the event of a default on the repayment of the loan, the shares of Tata Teleservices were not sold to a third party, Tata Sons agreed to an arrangement whereby the bank would sell the shares to Tata Sons.He added that a part of the consideration was funded by another Tata company for a few days on market-linked terms.In 2006, when the loan was refunded, the Tata group withdrew this guarantee, and the Siva group had to provided other collateral to the bank, the documents show.Then came the 2008 deal with DoCoMo under which the latter bought shares amounting to 26% of Tata Teleservices equity. Of the 26%, 20% was to be fresh equity and 6%, a sale by existing shareholders. Under this, the documents with Mint show, Sivasankaran sold 20.74 million shares at Rs117.81 apiece, turning a tidy profit.The DoCoMo investment eventually turned sour, and with no initial public offering in sight, the Japanese company exercised a put option. The resulting litigation led to an award of Rs8,450 crore to DoCoMo. Of this, the Siva groups share was Rs694 crore.The September legal notice from the Siva group and a letter to Mistry in October 2013 from Sivasankaran refer to Tata Teleservicess dire need for equity, and present the Siva groups investment in the company as a sort of lifeline.This representation was disputed by Mistry in his response to the letter. I have been advised by Mr (Ratan) Tata that the investment made by the Siva Group was made principally on the consideration that the telecom sector was fast-growing and represented a good investment opportunity. In his letter, Sivasankaran referred to an earlier letter to Ratan Tata in 2011 seeking assistance in finding a buyer for the Siva groups holding in Tata Teleservices.He further asks Mistry for a fair resolution (presumably a buyback of his holdings) in line with the mutually benevolent relation between the Tata group and Siva group which made the Siva group walk the extra miles to support the Tata group by undertaking risks which no financial investor acting in self-interest would.From Rays comments, it looks like that resolution is headed for the courts.",2016-11-09,8UuRA0q7zaqX07hXw3QxPL,"At his penultimate Tata Sons board meeting as chairman, Cyrus Mistry raised the issue, the documents show",01:31,Cyrus Mistry was trying to get Siva group to pay share of DoCoMo award

It certainly wont be the last. This vitiated environment poses a huge threat to the global information technology (IT) services industry which depends for its existence on the free flow of ideas, technology and talent. It also poses a massive threat for India, which is at the epicentre of the global IT industry and is already struggling with the challenge of jobless growth. It is futile to wishfully hope that this too shall pass. The game has irrevocably changed and the government of India and Indian technology companies need to embrace this new reality and act accordingly. Free trade is based on Adam Smiths thesis of comparative advantage; trading leaves both partners better off. Certainly outsourcing has created a lot of jobs and prosperity in India. However it hasnt done so at the expense of American jobs; rather, by enabling US companies to innovate and be more cost-efficient, Indias technology companies have helped US companies grow and create more jobs in their core businesses. For instance, at the heart of virtually every engineered product whether a Cisco Systems router, a General Electric engine or scanner, or Skype, is code written in India. By taking on uncompetitive IT operations and dying technology products, and re-badging employees, Indias tech companies have contributed directly to saving American jobs.ALSO READ | H1B visas: Business as usual after short-term flapIndian tech companies have helped create over 400,000 jobs in the US, paid over $20 billion in taxes in the past five years, and made a difference to 120,000 young Americans through various STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education initiatives. Indian technology companies provide mission-critical support to well over 75% of Fortune 500 US companies including banks, retailers, and car manufacturers. Unfortunately companies, Indian and American, have neglected to effectively make this argument forcefully and persuasively to the American people and lawmakers using robust data. Its time we did for there is much at stake here for everyone. Second, Indian tech companies must apply every ounce of energy and creativity they have to de-risking their business model and act as though their very existence depends on this. Assuming the worst-case scenario, they must move even faster to localize and near-shore their business. Equally they must leverage new technologiesartificial intelligence, automation, telepresence and augmented realityto develop a more extreme model of offshoring that relies less and less on engineers being on client premises.

0.14,"The National Stock Exchanges Nifty IT index rose 1.6% on Wednesday and recovered about 30% of its losses since the US election results came out. Investors seem to have concluded that the earlier 5.4% correction in the index was overdone. The bounceback on Wednesday might also be because the information technology (IT) sector is perhaps the only one which isnt impacted at all by the demonetization process, causing investors to take refuge in it. 
				   
				In any case, investors dont seem overly concerned about the Donald Trump presidency. Of course, its too early to say how things will play out. Trump will assume office only in January, and its not clear if the rhetoric during campaigning will translate into drastic changes in regulations. Also read: Donald Trump brings uncertainties for IndiaEven so, investors should note that the risks of a Trump presidency go far beyond just visas. For instance, Trump may repeal Obamacare and this can impact growth for the sector. Healthcare has been the fastest growing segment for Indian IT. A big driver of growth in healthcare has been regulations such as Obamacare and if that is scrapped, there could be a negative impact on demand, analysts at Nomura Research wrote in a note to clients. They add that if Trumps statements about reducing wasteful and unnecessary regulations actually translate into fewer regulations, the resultant cutback in regulatory and compliance-related spending by banking and financial services clients will hit revenues for the IT sector in the near term. From a shorter-term perspective, a cut back in regulatory and compliance spending with Mr Trump looking to put a moratorium on further regulations in the banking space might be a negative for Indian IT companies that derive ~35-40% of revenues from this vertical, they said in the note. Of course, if these measures result in better growth for the banking and financial services industry in the US, it will be a long-term positive for Indian IT as well. Risks related to new immigration rules are not trivial either. Tighter rules could result in an increase in the minimum wages for H-1B visas and higher visa costs, which would impact margins materially. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities pointed out in a recent note that the Democrats-founded immigration reform bill of 2013, if passed, would have impacted Indian ITs earnings anywhere between 12% and 20%. The impact will vary depending on profit margins of a company. In recent years, Indian IT firms have increased the proportion of local hires and on-site salaries have been raised as well. As such, the impact of tighter immigration rules may not be as severe as a few years ago.

In what is traditionally a seasonally strong period for the sector, large companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Wipro Ltd reported either flat revenue or a decline compared to the June quarter. Ahead of the earnings season, analysts had warned that investors should brace for what is likely to be the weakest performance since the global financial crisis.
				   
				But things turned out to be far worse than expected, especially in the case of TCS, where revenues were far below expectations, and Mindtree Ltd, which reported a 3% sequential decline in revenue.Still, IT stocks have done fairly well since the results season began. Shares of TCS, Wipro and HCL Technologies Ltd have risen between 3.5% and 4.5% since 14 October, beating the 1.4% rise in the Nifty during the period. Infosys Ltd has fallen by 1.2%, despite the fact that the company clearly beat all of its peers in terms of growth last quarter. But investors seem to be worried about its weak guidance about the rest of the year, although it must be noted that Infosys appears to have been overly conservative with its guidance.Overall, IT results and the post-results commentary gave enough reasons for worry. But on the contrary, IT investors seem to be cheering the results. What gives?Of course, there are different factors at play with each of these stocksfor instance, investors seem to be excited with Wipros bold acquisition moves, despites its continued weak performance on the revenue growth front. With HCL Tech, growth met the Streets expectations, thanks to continued strength in its infrastructure management services practice. HCL Techs margins have turned out to be better than expectations for two quarters in a row, which has come as a relief as well.As pointed out in this column earlier, the rise in TCS shares is a mystery, especially since its revenue growth of 1% was far lower than expectations.

0.55,"New Delhi: Online eyewear retailer Lenskart, which forayed into the premium segment with private label John Jacobs a couple of years ago, is now planning to expand the labels footprint in India by launching new stores, according to a top company executive.
				   
				The label, which has three retail stores across Delhi and Bengaluru, is set to launch a fourth one next week. The company aims to have 10 John Jacobs retail outlets in the next one year across the two cities. While Lenskart launched the first John Jacobs retail store in 2015 to test waters in the premium market, it remained quiet about this pilot until recently when the company decided to open more stores. In March 2016, Lenskart, run by Lenskart Solutions Pvt. Ltd, appointed former chief executive of food delivery company Foodora Sambuddha Bhattacharya as business head to spearhead John Jacobs.According to the company, while John Jacobs brand is owned by Lenskart Solutions Pvt. Ltd, a franchise of Lenskart, DealsKart Online Services Pvt. Ltd, operates and runs the website and stores of John Jacobs.DealsKart is owned by Lenskart founder Peyush Bansal along with Usha Singhal and Neetu Mittal, according to official documents filed with the registrar of companies.Talking to Mint, Bhattacharya explained that Lenskart supplies materials to franchisee DealsKart to run front-end operations. However, the need to create an independent website, mobile application (currently work in progress) and retail stores for John Jacobs lies in the fact that it caters to a different market segment than Lenskart, said Bhattacharya. While Lenskarts vision is to become a (multi-brand) retailer, (focus on) tier 2 expansion, go on to provide affordable access to eyewear, it made more sense to create John Jacobs a separate (premium) brand because we are solving a different problem... (Through John Jacobs) we are building to be in the affordable luxury segment, he said. A team of 32, the stand-alone brand John Jacobs targets 25-35-year-olds, selling them eyewear at an average price of Rs4,000. 90% of its sales come through its retail stores. Clocking an average of over $830,000 in monthly revenues, the company expects John Jacobs to register $10 million revenue for fiscal 2016-17, up jump from $4 million.The premium brand also retails through shop-in-shop agreement with retail stores of Shoppers Stop, and services online orders from Australia, Philippines and the UK. Delhi-based multi-brand retailer Lenskart sells eyeglasses, sunglasses, contact lenses and eyewear accessories. It has retail stores across 90 cities, and targets Rs3,000 revenue by 2020. During fiscal 2015-16, it posted a 63% jump in revenues to Rs99 crore, Mint reported on 4 January.

0.7,"Mumbai: The ongoing crisis in the $103 billion conglomerate is unlikely to impact Brand Tata, said Harish Bhat, chairman of Tata Global Beverages Ltd and brand custodian of the group. 
				   
				In an interview, he said that it was business as usual in all the operating companies even though the current spat had been tough to deal with at a personal level. Edited excerpts:As the custodian of the Tata brand are you concerned about brand erosion?First and foremost, the Tata brand is the result of many decades of initiatives which have to do with providing excellent products and service to our customers, which have to do with providing value back to the community, and which have to do with the highest level of corporate governance. So, this is a brand which has been built assiduously over several decades. Second is the consumers,  who buy our services and brands. Their trust in the Tata brand remains unchanged. Has the Tata brand been affected with respect to stakeholders?I would say this controversy perhaps has to some extent impacted the way some stakeholders look at the brand, and we will need to build on the brand and nurture it in the future, bearing that in mind.(Cyrus) Mistry has alleged some governance violations. As a representative of the chairman office of Tata Sons, how do you respond to that?Firstly, to have a chairman who is in open hostility with the promoter company puts at risk all the shareholders of the company. The company uses the brand name of the primary promoter company. There are credit ratings the company enjoys. People work in the company because it is part of a larger group. There are collaborations with joint venture partners which have been supported by Tata Sons.The other fact you mentioned is also very relevant. The board governance guidelines which was adopted by the board of Tata Global Beverages Ltd (TGBL) very clearly specified that if you were an employee of the company and if you were a non-executive director on the board of another Tata company and if you moved out of employment in your primary company, then you would also immediately resign from the boards of operating companies where you were a non-executive director. This was clause 2.9 of board governance guidelines which was adopted by the board of TGBL. It was adopted unanimously by the board, and the board at that time was chaired by Mistry.ALSO READ | What does Cyrus Mistry gain by trashing the Tata group?So, the question is now Mistry should also follow these guidelines which he has not done. I do believe that this is violation of the board governance guidelines. This is the second reason why we felt he should be replaced. This has been clearly mentioned in the appeal that Tata Sons has put out to all shareholders earlier this month.Isnt he still a director on the board of Tata Sons and hence an employee?A non-executive director is not an employee. He was an employee of Tata Sons until he was the chairman of Tata Sons.What about the allegations he has made about governance of the operating companiesTata Sons and Tata Trusts?I have been on the board of several operating companies of the group, and I must say that they are run independently by their own boards of directors. Our boards debate and discuss what the future strategy of the company should be, what the capital allocation should be. Those are decisions taken by the boards of the respective companies. As far as I am concerned, my experience on the boards of the companies is that the companies are independently run, are supervised by very competent boards composed of very competent and reputed independent and non-independent directors.What happens if in certain EGMs Mistry is not voted out?First and foremost I want to preface my answer to that to say that Tata Sons has issued an appeal to all our shareholders. Ratan Tata, our interim chairman has also written a letter to all our shareholders. In these letters and appeals, we have put forward our case very strongly on why the continued presence of Mistry on the boards of our operating companies can be disruptive and dysfunctional to those companies. The appeal from Tata Sons has also pointed out the corporate governance violation, which I discussed a little while ago. I am very confident that the shareholders will take those appeals and letters into account before deciding how they will vote in the best interests of the companies where they hold equity stake.ALSO READ | Tata Motors emerges as key battle in Tata vs Mistry fightFor any reason, if the situation arises, as you are describing it, then it is up to the board of Tata Sons to decide what they would like to do. What next now? How do you resolve this dispute?We have EGMs coming up next week. In those EGMs,  there are resolutions which Tata Sons has moved. Those resolutions will get voted upon. We are very keen to put the focus and spotlight very clearly on profitable growth of each operating firm within the company so that we can run as fast as required to create the right level of shareholder value. Is the group prepared for a long legal battle?The group will do whatever is right to safeguard our shareholders and safeguard all our stakes.Can you share with us whats top of your mind now?There are 2-3 things. First and foremost, I want to use this opportunity to pay tribute to all the operating companies of Tata group. Over the last few weeks, while this issue has been very actively discussed in media and in public forums, we must recognize and appreciate that for all our operating companies it has been business as usual. Also, at a personal level, the last few weeks have been very difficult for me, but not so difficult at a professional level. Let me explain why. At a personal level its difficult because any such situation for a person like me, who has been part of the Tata group for 30 years now, I think it creates anxiety. On the other hand, at a professional level, I have always borne in mind I should do what is right for the institution.ALSO READ | What if other Tata group shareholders vote the same way as those at TCS?Can you tell how you will restore the brand value which has been impacted to some extent?Two or three things. One is the principles on which the brand has been built remain unchanged. We do what is right by all our stakeholders, and they include our consumers, our financial shareholders, community, vendor partners and value chain partners and, of course, our employees.You were also a part of the group executive council under Cyrus Mistry. We understand that he was about to present a governance document which would define the relationship between Tata Sons, the trusts and the operating companies. Can you share something of that?I do not want to share in this interview any information about any documents that were being discussed in confidence. I hope you appreciate my point of view here. Having said that, yes, I was a member of the operating council under Mistry. There were specific roles that he had assigned to me in the GEC which were to do with customer-centric promoting, customer centricity and customer excellence in the group. They were to do with providing marketing support to some of the new businesses that we were incubating within Tata Sons.Were you a part of those discussions?Some discussions I was a part of, some I was not. There were discussions on many matters within the GEC. On the specific question you have asked on the governance document, I would not like to comment.Why is it that almost all the directors of Tata Global Beverages who have voted against Mistry have filed caveats against him in the Bombay high court?I do not want to comment on any legal matters. I believe the company will do whatever is right under the law.TGBL is the only listed company that has not called an EGM to remove Mistry as director?It is up to Tata Sons to decide if they want to call an EGM and in what order. Whenever Tata Sons calls the EGM, if they do and when they do, then we will have the EGM.Can you tell us what happened at the TGBL board meeting on 15 November? What was the need to move the circular resolution later? Is it an admission that it was not all kosher at the board meeting?No, absolutely not. The board meeting was conducted in strict adherence to the process of law. Whatever was the legal process required to introduce a resolution was followed to the T. Thats the first point I would like to make. I have already mentioned in an earlier interview that the reason I moved that resolution in the board meeting is because I believe, and eventually as you know seven out of 10 board members voted for that resolution, that Mr Mistrys continued presence as chairman of the board while he was also at the same time in an adversarial and hostile relationship with the primary promotor Tata Sons would be very harmful to the interests of the shareholders of TGBL.The circular resolution which was moved thereafter was without prejudice to the board meetings. It was just to re-emphasise the fact that a majority of directors were strongly in support of replacing Mistry as the chairman of the board for all the risks I pointed out earlier.What about the video recording. Why was it not made available to Mistry?Mistrys correspondence was with the company secretary of Tata Global Beverages and to the best of my knowledge the company secretary of Tata Global Beverages has responded to Mistry. I would also like to say that the law provides for the minutes of the meeting which have been recorded by the company secretary to be finalized within a period of time in case the video recording for some reason is not available. That legal process was also followed completely.In his representation to Tata Sons, Nusli Wadia said that in the case of Tata Steel, the founding fathers had given the company the name since 1907. Tata Steel existed much before Tata Sons and the brand agreement was signed only in 1998 so this needs to be examined and addressed. What are your views?I am very clear that the Tata trademark is owned by Tata Sons. The ownership of the trademark is with Tata Sons. Under a brand equity licence agreement, operating companies of the group use the trademark. So, those two facts are very clear to me and beyond that I dont want to add anything because trademark ownership is an established law in our country and indeed all parts of the world. We are also very clear that Tata Sons has added a lot of value to the Tata brand name.Do you think the independence of operating companies will be curtailed in the future?Each operating company of the Tata company is an independent organization. The board of directors of each individual company, whether it be of Titan (Co. Ltd) or Tata Global Beverages or Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), or any company of the group, the board of directors of that individual company is the one that guides the organization, which provides the strategic and governance framework for that company. We have a very competent board of directors with very competent independent and non-independent directors on each board. Having said that, each operating company of the Tata group does not exist in a vacuum. It exists as a part of the larger Tata group and I think it benefits greatly...like the use of the Tata trademark, credit rating and talent acquisition. So, you are saying that it will be status quo in the way that they are operating?I also want to say that, some of us who represent Tata Sons on the boards of these operating companies, what we do and what the entire board does is ensure that we try to maximize values for our entire shareholders into the future.Does profitable growth also entail exiting companies, which seems to be a bone of contention?(Ratan) Tatas letter to the shareholders has specified that very clearly. He has addressed the issue. He said very clearly that as a promoter, Tata Sons constantly evaluates new business opportunities and investments. Some of these investments have been successful while some others have taken time to be profitable. Our approach has been to support and fund these businesses during their development and growth phases. He has also mentioned that we will exit the business when we believe it is inviable.What are your views on where the group is headed with all these changes?See, my belief is that Tata Group is not just a corporation. It is an institution. It is an institution which is now 149 years of age. Its strongly embedded in some values which I think are dear to the institution. It symbolizes trust, it symbolizes the highest levels of corporate governance and it symbolizes doing good for the community or being a good corporate citizen. Those three fundamental pillars of the Tata brand will remain unchanged.R. Krishna Kumar, a trustee and director on the Tata Sons board, had in an earlier interview with the media shared that a succession plan for Tata Trusts is being discussed. This vindicates Cyrus Mistrys stand with respect to the governance structure of Tata Trusts, that it needs to be reworked.I do not want to comment on that. I am not part of the Tata Trusts. My relationship has been far more with Tata Sons and the operating companies. Thats a decision for Tata Sons to take. I do not wish to comment on the statement he has made.Given that you have worked Mistry for 3-3.5 years, did you see this coming?My working was with respect to all the functions he had allocated to me. And as far as Tata Sons is concerned, I do not have the visibility and would not like to comment on that. I have not been privy to those discussions and would not like to comment on that.How was it working with Mistry?I must mention this very clearly that I hold Mistry in very good personal regard. I have worked closely with him and the opportunity that he gave me to work as a member of the GEC and the specific role he gave me within the GEC. I have had several discussions with him. Those discussions were very cordial, very professional. I must say that I have not had the time so far over the last several weeks as you will no doubt realize to sit down and reflect on all those three years. But may be sometime in the future, I will do so.Was he a tough boss?How do you define tough. He was a boss who heard me out on areas I discussed with him and he would give me whatever decisions I wanted. If there was a specific area that he thought required far more intense work, he would tell me that.How is it that you and Mukund Rajan were retained and the other members of the GEC were let go?I can only talk about my performance appraisal. I also would not like to comment on other members of the GEC. I can only talk about the role I played. I did my role to the best of my capability. Whatever role was given to me, which I have already mentioned earlier. Now its up to Tata Sons and my boss at Tata Sons to judge how I performed.",2016-12-17,EReffw5Q2VhEVa25BzNgDN,Tata Global Beverages chairman Harish Bhat says its business as usual in all group firms though the Tata vs Mistry spat is tough to deal with at a personal level,02:38,Trust in the Tata brand remains unchanged: Harish Bhat
0.25,"Mint reported on 3 November that Tata Sons Ltd does not have a controlling stake in several Tata group companies including Tata Steel Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd. Cyrus Pallonji Mistry is the chairman of these companies and if he doesnt resignit is clear now that he wontthe holding company of the Tatas is going to have to fight a long and possibly bruising shareholder and legal battle to get him out. 
Mint reported on 4 November, citing a person close to the ousted chairman of Tata Sons, that he will indeed not resign as chairman of the Tata operating companies. Meanwhile, Tata Sons has disbanded the Group Executive Council. Three of its five members, all Mistrys hires, have left. The other two, Tata group veterans, have survived and been assigned larger roles. Mistrys email to the board of Tata Sons, a day after he was asked to go on 24 October, has raised several questions, just as Tata Sons explanation for asking Mistry to go has. Stories repeating these questions, or proffering answers to them, have started appearing in mainstream media, signs that the PR machinery on both sides has swung into action. Mint reported details of the PR and legal teams both sides have lined up on 1 November. Tata Sons cannot afford to have Mistry continue as chairman of the operating companies, although it is unlikely to push for his exit as a director. The second will require the support of a larger group of shareholders; the first will merely need to be approved by the board in a vote. Mistry, though, is likely to push for a vote by shareholders. In 2012-13, shortly after he took over as chairman of Tata Sons, the boards of these operating companies and their shareholders approved his nomination as their chairman too, but Mistry seems to think they may not toe the Tata Sons line this time. Given that his thinking on aviation and the Tata Nano is exactly that of several analysts, he may have good reason to believe that at least some shareholders approve of his actions and will support him.ALSO READ | Tata Group firms independent directors left in the dark on Cyrus Mistry ousterSo, what is likely to happen? Before we look at scenarios, let us try and understand the interests of the two sides. Tata Trusts, the dominant shareholder of Tata Sons, and Ratan Tata, chairman of Tata Trusts, want to re-establish control over the operating companies. They have already regained control of the holding company (indeed, they were never not in control), and also removed all of Mistrys men who had group-level positions. Mistry, a person close to him says, wants to protect the Tatas (as in the group) from Tata (as in Ratan Tata and Tata Trusts), and also safeguard his familys 18.38% holding in Tata Sons. I think he also wants to save face, for surely, this is not a fight he can expect to win. Now to the scenarios.The first involves a settlement between Mistry and Tata Sons, but given the bad blood on both sides, the chances of this are remote. It is also not clear what Tata Sons could give Mistry that would make him go quietly. Still, stranger things have happened. The second involves Mistry selling his stake. The person close to Mistry who has been mentioned above says this isnt on the table. Still, if Mistry does choose to exit, he could unload his stake in Tata Sons to an activist shareholder who could prove a thorn in the side of the company, a rival business group, or a passive investor aligned with the Tatas. The third involves a protracted battleat the level of the directors of the operating companies, at the level of shareholders of the operating companies, in the media, and in courts and regulatory bodies. Id hate to see the third happen because it will end up being bad not just for the Tata group, but Indian business itself in so many ways. That said, it does seem the most likely scenario. It is also one where Mistry has nothing to lose and the Tatas, a lot. Whoever wins, in the short-term, it is the Tata group that is the loser. Many of the Tata companies face significant challenges, but their leaders are likely to be distracted by the ongoing fight (apart from being confused about who to listen to). Mistrys email has already taken some of the sheen off the groups squeaky-clean image and the allegations and counter-allegations that have begun to fly will take some more off. He may have lost his job but ensuing eventsand it has been just two weeksmean the Tata group could lose its halo. R. Sukumar is editor, Mint.",2016-11-07,EbsVxDsNltu1baRDTjFQvM,Tata Sons cannot afford to have Cyrus Mistry continue as chairman of some of its firms but is unlikely to push for his exit as shareholders may not toe its line,02:39,Cyrus Mistry is unlikely to go quickly or quietly
-0.07,"Mumbai: The root cause of the current conflict in the Tata group is groups operating structure itself, said proxy advisory firm Institutional Investors Advisory Services (IiAS) in a research note on Saturday. The Tata Trusts exert control over Tata Sons, which exerts control over operating companies, several of which  are listed and subject to scrutiny by external stakeholders including shareholders, it said. 
				   
				While shareholders expect them to operate along commercial lines, given that the companies belong to the Tata group, these are overlaid with additional expectations regarding behaviour and the brand. According to IiAs philanthropy running a commercial business creates its own paradoxes. The Trusts elegantly solved this problem by putting Tata Sons between themselves and the operating companies: The trusts could remain philanthropic even as Tata Sons pushed businesses to deliver higher profit. The Tata group needs to address possible areas of conflict and clearly set the terms of engagement between the three tiers of the group. They need to put in place an operating structure that outlives individuals, it said. To be sure, the nine page missive issued by Tata Sons on Thursday exposed the internal conflict among the different entities. The holding company accused the ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry of betraying the trust it had reposed in him and seeking to control the main operating companies of the Tata group to the exclusion of Tata Sons and other Tata representatives. The current scenario, says the proxy firm should be used as an opportunity to fix the structural issues in the Tata Group, a representatives. IiAs suggest that in order to align the interests of the Tata Trusts and Tata Sons, the chairperson of the Tata Trusts and Tata Sons must be the same individual as this has worked smoothly in the past. It also suggests Tata Trusts and Tata Sons in future should be run by independent CEOs with roles of each defined clearly. While the chairperson should be the custodian of the Tata brand, the role of the CEO of Tata Sons should be a bit more than that of a portfolio manager. The Tata Sons CEO should monitor the performance of companies, establish dividend policy and be responsible for capital allocation between companies. Additionally, the Tata Sons CEO should ensure adherence to the brand identity, and exploit group synergies by providing common services. The CEO should have the flexibility to rebalance portfolio companies, within reason given the Tata brand is associated with these. Like in corporate boards, the Tata Sons CEO will be answerable to the board and the chairperson. He should also ensure that that costs and the bureaucracy at Tata Sons does not balloon  a recent charge, it should be desirable to cap costs as a fixed percentage.Well-defined roles and an unambiguous chain of command should ensure that all participants are clear about their roles and responsibilities. The proposed structure is likely to be beneficial for all stakeholders  the stakeholders of listed companies as well as the Tata Trusts.The battle between Mistry and Ratan Tata has been intensifying with each passing day with neither side showing signs of relenting. In an indication, that it will a long drawn battle, Tata Sons in a bid to remove Mistry from the boards of various operating companies have sought shareholder resolution.",2016-11-12,Eww2BAoGuf1EkiJUOmIS5J,IiAS says Tata group need to put in place an operating structure that outlives individuals,14:18,Root cause of Tata group conflict is its structure itself: IiAS
0.23,"New Delhi: Heads Up For Tails, a retailer of pet products, has raised $2 million in a pre-series-A round from a group of high networth individuals (HNIs), the company said in a statement on Monday. 
				   
				This fresh round of funding comes as a huge milestone for the brand and we look forward to using it to further enhance the end-user experience by investing in technology, said the founder of Heads Up For Tails, Rashi Sanon Narang, in the statement. Moreover, the company plans to use the funding for expanding business in both domestic and overseas markets. The company also plans to open more retail stores. Owned and operated by Precious Pet Services Pvt. Ltd., Heads Up For Tails was founded by Narang in 2008. The brand sells grooming products for cats and dogs, in addition to pet food, apparel, toys and accessories. It claims to have more than 100,000 active customers. Based on an omni-channel strategy, the company sells through its website as well as operates offline retail stores. The company also sells overseas in Singapore and the US.

0.6,"At 62, Max Group founder Analjit Singh is trim and fit and says he is at peace with himselfa state of mind achieved because he doesnt feel the need for habra any more. Translated from Punjabi, that means he is no longer in a tearing hurry, as he was 30 years ago.
				   
				In January, Analjit Singh stepped down as chairman of the group he founded in 1982 and built into a Rs15,000 crore empire, with interests in life insurance; health and allied businesses; and speciality packaging films. In August, the board of Max Life Insurance Co. Ltd signed off on a merger with HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd that will create Indias largest private-sector insurer, with Rs1.1 trillion in assets.The promoters of Max Financialessentially Analjit Singh, his family and related family firmswill hold a 6.5% stake in the merged company and also get a non-compete fee of Rs850 crore. Analjit Singh, who within Max Group is called BAS (short for Bhai Analjit Singh, bhai being an honorific meaning brother), doesnt like being called a promoter, preferring the term sponsor, and seems to have achieved what most business family owners can only think of wistfullya degree of detachment from the business that allows him to take decisions without any emotional baggage.Analjit Singh stands out among the top echelons of business leadership in India for his ability to spot an opportunity like he did with telecom (Singh made Rs561 crore in 1998 by selling his 41% stake in a joint venture with Hutchison Whampoa Ltd)  and insurance and healthcare early on, and  more than that to quit when on top. He ascribes that to foresight and luck; but in reality, it is the mark of a businessman who can read the tea leaves.Analjit Singh, with the reputation of a serial entrepreneur, is also exploring new businesses, including information technology, real estate and education, under Max Ventures and Industries Ltd (MVIL). In an interview at his elegant home on New Delhis tony Abul Kalam Azad Road, Analjit Singh patiently explained his philosophy of life, his current state of mind and how the two relate to his business. Edited excerpts:As a strategic businessman, what are the things you are looking at now? When you look at these opportunities, what excites you the most?
I am not so sure that people in my situation look at entrepreneurial opportunities from purely a new-world perspective, as you pointed out. I think they look at entrepreneurial and future opportunities in rather a traditional way but think of these developments as enablers.What is the traditional way?
It is perspective of the market, key differentiators, compatibility of extensive weaknesses of the individual and the firm to be able to do something like this. So, therefore, in the traditional criteria of finding these opportunities what I meant was market, differentiator, opportunities, regulation...new factor, completely new factor in the decision-making set. The market is over-crowded. Everybody is in the business of over-promising and under-delivering. Capital is no longer a constraint like it was before. To some extent, even technology is no longer a constraint to those people who have some experience and network, you can find the technology. Anything is possible. If you run a world-class airline, technology is available. So, execution is the key. Team is a big factor. Team was never a question in our mind in the past 10-15 years. Today, if I were looking to be in a big business, probably the first question that I will ask apart from market and differentiator is people and team; and then you look at these new-world solutions that you are talking about as how they can become enablers to what they can do.Besides that, this question is not so pertinent to me. I am not super-engaged to be so rattled about what am I going to do and what will be my next big play. It is not top-most of my mind.But you will do new things, right?
I will do new things, but I will say I am not besotted with it anymore. My interest is more to tame myself and tame my mind and tame my life. Do you know this word habra? I have no habra.Were you like that when you did the diversification?
Of course not! Thirty years ago, I was always in a rush.If you forget about the future for now and look at the past 16 years, what are the things that you have picked up?
I dont call myself a promoter. I prefer the word sponsor. I think if a sponsor does not have an affinity with the business, that business unless by luck things take-off, I think that business drags. The affinity of a sponsor to a particular business segment is very important. If (Bharti Airtel Ltd founder) Sunil Mittal did not have an affinity for telecom or for technology, Airtel would not have been what it is today (Indias biggest phone services provider). If I did not have an affinity for being in the businesses of life and, therefore, focus on healthcare and insurance for 15-16 years, it wouldnt have worked.Affinity and focus leads to execution, passion capital, heavy-lifting, good team equals to success. Therefore, you can apply that mantra to anythingold world or new world. What would you call an old-world business? Pick anything. If I say to myself that I am going to leave everything in my life and get into steel and cement, I will find a new way of doing it and I will be successful in 5-7 years. I will find a way because the need for steel and cement is not gone. If you do it as another unit with the traditional way and traditional people, it is a recipe for disaster. So, we have to find an IndiGo (Indias biggest airline) way of getting in steel or cement. IndiGo is a very good example of what I am saying. What is the revolution and reinvention of being in the airline business? People have been in the airline business. They are in the airline business. They will be in the airline business, but most companies fail. So, why is IndiGo successful? Do you think (IndiGo co-founder) Rahul Bhatia goes and fixes the tyres of the plane every day? No. But somewhere between Aditya (Ghosh, IndiGo president) and him, the way they work is set. So, the way we work in insurance and healthcare is set, and everybody then would perform to that tune. Thats because you have affinity. Thats a clear lesson and experience that I can share.Somebody asked me the other day that you are not even now non-executive chairman of your companies. I am of the MVIL (Max Ventures India Ltd) because I am having fun again after 30 years to nurture a new company. Of those, you are of Vodafone.My point there was: to be a non-executive chairman of a company where you are a sponsor is very different from a non-executive chairman of a company where you are not a sponsor. My remake, role, life, expectations, contact, engagement, communication has to be very different if I am a non-executive chairman of a Max company. The deliverables and expectations are different when it comes to  being non-executive chairman of Vodafone. I am not a sponsor. They dont have the same expectation.When do you as a promoter decide that it is time that you should become a sponsor? Let us assume that this second wave of successful diversification that you did were not successful, would you still be saying all this?
So, in a way, it also gets linked to your expectations from future and living with disappointments from your past. Thats in a way what you are saying. I think the honest answer has to be that if the outcomes were not as exciting as they have been, I think, I would have not been as restful in my mind about it as I am appearing right now. I think thats possibly the case, but it also means in my current way of thinking that I would have to work harder at myself to become restful about the disappointments of the past.So, luckily for meand luck is a factor or the blessing that I havethe way I see it from nature and everything else is that these have moved reasonably in tandem. If they had not, the stretch would have been more and one would have to work harder to overcome those disappointments.Is there someone else in your fraternity who has done this really well? Is there a role model?
I wont go to the extent of saying whether I have a role model. I wont say that I am looking at somebody and say look how he did it. But I can tell you who has done it and done it very successfully. He is Vikram Lal (promoter of Eicher Motors Ltd). He is very restful and peaceful as a person. Look what has happened to Eicher. He wanted a particular life for some reason and he went after it and he has got it.I so solidly believe in impermanence that for me to be attached to a business, in this case, life insurance, it is stupid to be attached to it. When life is impermanent then what is this stigma about a business being permanent. Today, when you look at it, the power of this sector in this business is moving to banks. Whether these (insurance) companies are going to be profitable or not will not be because our premiums will get higher. We have the highest persistency (a measure of policy renewals) in the country84%. It is unheard of. The No. 2 company is 63%. So, I cant have more persistency in this business. The banks are now controlling distribution virtually. So, the only way to improve profitability is expense management. So, power shifting from agency to bankers, premiums not going up, expense management, regulators everywhere in this world are tightening the screws on the companies. Solvency margin, shareholder profits, expense allowance and disallowance, participating account versus shareholder account. No. 3 some sort of going back to expense management and market share, some sort of geographies have emerged for different companies. We are very strong in Gujarat; Gujarat is our second or third largest territory. But, more or less, we are more strong in the north and the south than we are in the west or east. HDFC (Life) is more strong in the west and the south than they are in the north. So, if you take the bank they are, you take the opportunity to consolidate and, therefore, cut some unessential costs and you take the link and fourth, product. In our time, we were heavily into protection and savings products. Even today, 80% of our business comes from protection and savings products, not from ULIPs (unit-linked insurance plans) and the like. HDFC is other way around, may be two-third or one-third.These are the four things that I saw writing on the wall about. And I have to tell you that when as a sponsor, among the 23 or 24 companies that are in life (insurance), if you take the balance sheet of the sponsor, we must be one of the smallest, I think. So from being in that position to sitting at No.3 of 23-24 with all the names you know sitting below us, you can get spoilt; and then, one fine day, because of these four factors, nobody gives you notice of failure in life like you never get notice of death.The same is in this business, some things just happen, and they change and then all of a sudden you say, oh shit what has happened?Six months ago, we were like this. And you come from 3 to 6 to 8 to 9. I dont want to take that chance; but then, it will go back to the question you asked me that if at the end of all this it was not good, would you have felt the same thing and I would have said no and I would have to start again, building again. I can see it happening, but my responsibility is I must not let it happen. Here is my opportunity that God has sent to me, I must take it.But you do take impulsive decisions? You do take decisions on the basis of your instinct?
Of course, you do.In South Africa, for instance.
Of course, I did. But hang on, yes and no. The impulsive decision that was taken about South Africa was not for business. The impulsive decision was to want to be there and enjoy the location. Like I may have a home. So, that was the impulsive decision. When it started to go away from becoming a holiday home or retreat to business, then I am very conscious, not impulsive. So, today that operation is being run exactly like any company of the Max group, with a board, people, CEOs, accountability, targets, budgets, matrix and data.Is it a part of the Max group?
No, no, private. Max has nothing to do with it.Could you elaborate a little bit, what is it about?
It is about hospitality, lifestyle, hotels, rooms, agriculture, plums, wines, almonds, wine-making, selling wines, three hotels, beer. We have a similar property in the UK. The first property is Linthwaite (Lake District Hotel, Linthwaite House), which is in the UK. So, we will grow in the UK. We have just acquired it in April. On 25 April, we took over.Whats the vision for it?
I have always wanted to be in the hospitality business. When I started vision 2000 of Max, I picked four areas: it was insurance, healthcare, education and hospitality. When we got cracking on insurance and healthcare, we did not have five rupees, or five minutes or five calories of energy to invest in anything other than insurance and healthcare; so we left it at that. In a way, Antara (homes for senior citizens) and remotely Vana (wellness resort) were born out of this idea of hospitality. And now, I am starting my life in education. Education is one of them, but it is a little too premature to talk about. In education, we have started some work. Are we engaged in it? Yes, but what are we going do, I dont know. But we have decided to be in that sector, so I dont know whether its 0 to 11 or KG to 16.Is someone thinking about this?
Yes. Very much. But just now, in August, its too soon for me to say whether its going to be Boeing or Airbus or north only or all India or only abroad... But it will be top three. I just like that expression of top three. And it should be, otherwise whats the point?Why are you interested in the real estate business?
I have a bit of khurak (itch) here. Actually, my grandfather was in the contracting business. That was my great grandfathers business in Pakistan. The bhai family were contractors. They built the road from India to Burma as a case in point. So, even now, you go to Lahore and all, and you will see a lot of buildings built by them. People in the street remember them as a family. So, I have a khurak for civil, real estate and stuff. I like land. I like construction, I like design. I like building. Every time the economy is on the cusp, and every time we talk about India being the next big thing... there are sections which are being talked about such as manufacturing, real estate, education... Do you see the economy like that?
I do and on the manufacturing side, I cant tell you anything today. I hope I can tell you in 60 days.

				The voting pattern in recent days has been interesting. The directors on the board of Indian Hotels have backed Cyrus Mistry. The directors on the board of Tata Motors have preferred to sit on the fence for now. And the directors on the board of Tata Global Beverages have voted to remove Mistry as chairman. The two sides will have to fight it out company by company.As we have pointed out earlier, corporate governance in India is complicated because of the complex control structure in most Indian corporate groupsholding firms, investment companies and operating companies have stakes in one another. In the Tata case, a problem in the holding company has spilled over into operating companies with millions of shareholders. The ability of independent directors to vote with the interests of ordinary shareholders in mind will thus be crucial.Also read | Tata Sons board meeting on Thursday",2016-11-17,GbScNFD3FAcAwnInYyl4ZP,The role of directors on the boards of various Tata companies has also emerged as a decisive factor in the Ratan Tata vs Cyrus Mistry battles,01:28,Tata-Mistry spat a litmus test for corporate governance
-0.4,"Those who have known Ratan Tata well over the years vouch for his sense of fair play, his innate courtesy and his infectious smile. What they also tell you is that he conceals an iron fist in a velvet glove. When it comes to business or matters related to his business interests, this is a man who believes not in win-win but win-loseI win and you lose. He may be 78 years old and for the last four years he seems to have been content playing the benevolent angel to a clutch of technology start-ups. But if you thought he had taken his eyes off the ball, the tough words in his signed statement as the new interim chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, following the abrupt and shocking replacement of Cyrus Mistry, should put such thoughts to rest. I have agreed to do so in the interest of stability and reassurance to the Tata group. Thats not a man looking to appease anyone, not even someone he helped appoint as his successor less than four years ago.
				   
				Not surprisingly, Mistry, a proven success in his own businesses and on the board of Tata Sons since 2006, differed and departed from what Ratan Tata had set in play over the two decades that he led the group. The disconnect though, seemed normal and related to business strategy. Tata Steels global operations were the personal handiwork of Ratan Tata, something he had staked his groups future on in 2007 when he paid $12 billion to buy UK steel maker Corus Group Plc. The move catapulted Tata into the list of the worlds top steel makers but also laid the seeds for the massive losses that Mistry inherited when he took over as chairman, coincidentally around the time that the commodities cycle was turning adverse. Mistrys calculated decision to exit the business may have seemed rational to him but for the ex-chairman it must have been a bitter pill to swallow.The roles seemed reversed when it came to aviation, which was clearly a passion for Tata. Mistry may or may not have been too excited about the venture into this already crowded area but certainly the splitting of the investments into Air Asia India and Vistara seemed at odds with his style of working.Yet, these were business decisions and in a group as professional as the Tatas, must have had the collective assent of the board members, which included Ratan Tata. Nor is the latter a stranger to a new chairman stamping his authority in a new position. One of his first moves on taking over as group chairman in 1991 was to tighten his control over the various group companies. Thus, powerful satraps like Russi Mody at Tata Steel Ltd and Darbari Seth at Tata Chemicals Ltd, who under his predecessor J.R.D. Tata had pretty much the run of the place, were reined in and then eased out. This was followed by a massive restructuring exercise to create a more streamlined and capital-efficient group.ALSO READ | Cyrus Mistry ousted as Tata Sons chairman, Ratan Tata steps inSo were there other reasons for this abrupt decision? A clash of wills at this level seems churlish. That Mistry wasnt even given the option of resigning points to unprecedented and unusual circumstances and holds out the promise of more developments. In its 148-year history, the group has experimented with different chairmen for Tata Sons and Tata Trusts only once beforewhen J.R.D. Tata headed the trusts and Ratan Tata headed Tata Sons. But that was for a only short time before JRDs death and, in any case, involved two Tatas. The failure of the move to appoint an outsider to head Tata Sons while Ratan Tata retained his hold over the trusts could also mean that the next chairman may well be from the larger Tata family.

				Tata Sons Ltd has moved resolutions to eject Cyrus Mistry and Nusli Wadia as directors of Tata Steel Ltd, Tata Chemicals Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd, as the spat following Mistrys ouster as chairman of the group turns more bitter.The three operating companies announced the resolutions brought by the group holding company in separate filings to the stock exchanges on Friday.  Tata Sons controls 26.51% of Tata Motors, 19.35% of Tata Chemicals and 29.75% of Tata Steel. The development followed Tata Chemicals board meeting on Thursday at which Wadia and other independent directors backed Mistry as chairman of the board. The directors said they took into consideration his performance for the past couple of years in backing him.It is an unprecedented move by the Tatas, said Amit Tandon, managing director and founder at Institutional Investor Advisory Services, a proxy advisory firm, alluding to the attempt to eject Wadia. Usually, companies do not remove the independent directors unless there are compelling reasons to do so, he added.   Besides Wadia, the seven-member board of Tata Chemicals has three other independent directorsY. S. P. Thorat, Vibha Paul Rishi and Nasser Munjee.It (resolution) is in the interest of all the stakeholders. Discord between the promoter and directors of the operating companies is a recipe for disaster, a Tata group official said on condition of anonymity, before the announcement to the stock exchanges. The move signals that the spat following Mistrys 24 October removal as Tata Sons chairman has entered a new, divisive phase, drawing clear lines between those supporting Ratan Tata, who has become interim chairman, and those backing Mistry. On Thursday, Tata Sons removed Mistry as chairman of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, in which it has a majority stake.In the days following Mistrys ouster from Tata Sons, the two sides have traded bitter accusations. On Thursday, the holding company accused Mistry of betraying the trust it reposed in him when it appointed him chairman in 2012. The Mistry camp said he was fired for going after holy cows in the Tata group.In a separate development, Bhaskar Bhat, a non-executive, non-independent director on the board of Tata Chemicals , resigned. In a letter to Mistry, Bhat said the content in the statement by independent directors dilutes his views expressed in the board meeting.The contents as well as the spirit of the statement completely dilutes the views I expressed at the Board meeting today especially regarding the threat the company faces on account of loss of confidence of the promoter Tata Sons in the chairman of Tata Chemicals Limited. Several important issues of discomfort I expressed seem to have been totally ignored. I therefore hereby tender my resignation as director of Tata Chemicals, with immediate effect, Bhat said in his letter. Wadia, chairman of Bombay Dyeing & Manufacturing Co.

0.53,"Mumbai: Cyrus Mistry, the ousted chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, on Sunday rebutted the 10 November statement of the Tata group holding company that alleged Mistry was seeking to control the main group operating firms to the exclusion of Tata Sons and other Tata representatives.
				   
				Tata Sons statement alludes to Mistry having created a new structure where operating companies were drifting away. This is furthest from the truth, said the statement from Mistrys office, while explaining the changes were made to reflect the contextual difference within which the group currently functions.The corporate governance framework in India has considerably tightened in recent times with more stringent rules on the independence of directors, female directors, board evaluation, and so on. To meet this increased scrutiny, several new policies and frameworks were developed at the group centre and deployed across operating companies, said the statement.As such, prior to Mistrys chairmanship, all board members of Tata Sons, with the exception of him, were internal to the group, being either vice-chairmen of group firms or members of the group corporate centre (GCC), said the statement, while pointing out that the structure is exactly the opposite today.According to the statement, the requirement to have 30% Trust nominees and 30% independent directors meant that in addition to Ishaat Hussain and Mistry, there was possibly only one more senior GCC member who could be on board of Tata Sons. This limited the involvement of other group centre members on Tata Sons board, said the note, adding that in the past three years, all these internal members, with the exception of Hussain, had retired. This was a generational change.As agreed with the Tata Sons board, the governance mechanism to protect Tata Sons interests and ensure adequate group representation on operating company boards was to have group executive council (GEC) members, other senior group centre members such as Farokh Subedar and S. Padmanabhan, and select chief executive officers such as Bhaskar Bhat and Noel Tata on the boards of operating firms.In addition, of the nine independent directors on boards of operating firms like Tata Chemicals Ltd and Indian Hotels Co.

Mistry as director from the board of the operating companiesto vote against the resolution as Tata Sons Ltd hasnt provided any compelling reasons. 
				   
				Six of the seven Tata-listed group companies where Mistry serves as a director have called for EGMs to replace Mistry as a director after having received requisition from the promoter shareholder Tata Sons. Tata Sons hasnt provided any compelling reasons for the removal of Mistry as a Director from the Boards of the operating companies, said the proxy advisory firm in an email on Thursday morning, while drawing out a case for each of the individual companies and why it recommends minority shareholders to vote against the resolution.Moreover, Tata Sons hasnt articulated any new plans or visions for the operating companies than what the Boards under Mistry had adopted, said InGovern. Also, it is important to note that Mistry continues to have a beneficial shareholding of 3-13% in the listed companies, through 18.4% minority shareholding in Tata Sons Ltd. His presence as a Director on the Boards of the listed companies should be a balance on the Boards and a representation of the minority shareholder. In many operating companies, Cyrus Mistry continues to have the confidence of the Independent Directors, said the advisory. Also read: Ratan Tata asks shareholders to back Mistrys removal from group firmsInGovern also urged shareholders to question inherent assumptions regarding the value of the group structure and the value of Tata brand and demand greater disclosures on information flow between Tata Sons and the operating companies.Minority shareholders should decide on their votes independent of the actions of the promoter shareholder, said the InGovern advisory note, which was the second proxy firm to come out in support of Mistry after Institutional Shareholders Services Inc. (ISS), a foreign proxy advisory firm. So far four advisory firms have issued recommendations which are now equally split for and against.Making a case for the individual companies, InGovern said that in the case of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, which is holding its EGM on 13 December, The promoter itself accepts that the performance of TCS has been good, we do not see any logic as to why a shareholder should vote for removal of a director who was the chairman, for performance issues.The advisory firm further questioned the logic as to why the board had recommended the removal of a director who was given a favourable rating as a chairman a few months back and conceded that the plausible reason is that he was a nominee of Tata Sons on the board of TCS and since he was replaced as chairman for Tata Sons, it is natural that he be removed from the board of TCS. Also read: Cyrus Mistrys office says he is fighting to protect Tata groupAccording to InGovern, Shapoorji Pallonji Group, which is represented by Mistry, has the second largest share in the company after the promoters at 13.47% which means he has skin in the game and hence his interests would be in the best interests of the company. InGovern also discarded the possibility that his presence would cause constant conflict and said that it feels that a board is more effective when everyone is not Yes-men of the promoters on the board. While the Articles of Association of TCS allows the promoter to appoint and replace a chairman without the need to seek prior opinion of the board, we believe such a provision greatly restricts how he powers of the board, said InGovern, which recommended shareholders to raise concerns to remove such provisions from the board. In the case of the Indian Hotels Co. Ltd, which has its EGM on 20 December, all the independent directors have shown support for Mistry and the proxy advisory firm has recommended shareholders to vote against the removal of Mistry from the board as there is no compelling logic, it said. For Tata Steel Ltd, which had its EGM on 21 December, the proxy advisory firm was against the removal of both Mistry and Nusli Wadia as a director. Wadia who had been on the board for 47 years has had a tenure which is far greater than the maximum 10 years for Independent directors, as per Companies Act, 2013. However, Tata Sons proposes his removal not due to his long tenure but because he acted in concert with Mistry. Promoters who remove independent directors who do not agree with their views also sets a bad precedent for Indian corporate governance and such efforts should be thwarted by voting against the promoter proposals, said InGovern. Also read: Cyrus Mistry-Ratan Tata spat: A look at how the events unfoldedIf it is because of the long tenure, then there are at least 10 independent directors across the several group companies, including Aman Mehta of TCS, Deepak Parekh at Indian Hotels, Nasser Munji at Tata Chemicals and Homiar Vaccha at Tata Power Ltd. The proxy advisory firm listed similar reasons to support its recommendations for voting against the removal of Mistry and Wadia in the case of Tata Motors Ltd and Tata Chemicals. It was also against the removal of Mistry from the board of Tata Power, which is holding its EGM on 26 December. The independent directors of Tata Power have not made their positions publicly known even as the other six companies have aired their views. InGovern and ISSs recommendations are in contrast to that of Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS), a Mumbai-based proxy advisory firm. On 30 November, IiAS advised shareholders to vote in favour of Mistrys removal as his continuation on the board may lead to unnecessary friction between the operating companies and Tata Sons. SES, another proxy advisory firm, also recommended voting in favour of Mistrys removal. SES in its analysis has found that the performance of the Company has been agnostic to different persons occupying the post of the Chairman. TCS appears to be a company having matured well settled processes and system and a competent work force and management team. Therefore, removal of Mr. Mistry as a director is not likely to impact performance of the Company.

Vaidyanathan (a professor at Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore), and Rakesh Mohan (a former RBI deputy governor).S: Shaktikanta Das (economic affairs secretary), Subir Gokarn (former RBI deputy governor and currently an executive director at the International Monetary Fund), and Sumit Bose (former finance secretary).U: U.K. Sinha (chairman of Securities and Exchange Board of India) and Urjit Patel (an RBI deputy governor).V: Vijay Kelkar (former finance secretary) and Vinod Rai (former Comptroller and Auditor General of India and now chairman of Bank Boards Bureau).Even after this, I may have missed a few names and apologize for that. There could be quite a few reasons behind so many names being cited as a possible successor to Rajan.One, many of the newspapers and TV channels indulge in speculation as they love to tell the world I told you so in case one of the many names being mentioned hits the bulls eye.Two, unlike in the past, there is a problem of plenty now and what we are witnessing is a fierce competition among a bunch of talented economists, bureaucrats and bankers for the job of Indias chief money man.Three, since we are relatively better off in terms of macroeconomic parameters, anybody can do this job. Jalan took over in the thick of east Asian crisis; D. Subbarao came in immediately after the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.; and Rajan occupied the seat when inflation was in double digits and the local currency was fast depreciating against the dollar. Now, we have a stable currency, relatively low inflation and low current account deficit.Finally, there could be trial balloons being floated by junior and not-so-junior bureaucrats through news-hungry media to gauge the public sentiment even as former governor Subbaraos tell-all book Who Moved My Interest Rate has queered the pitch for the government. Its a caution to the incumbent on the uneasy relationship that an RBI governor can have with the finance ministry and a message to the ministry that a governor, however close he is to the government before he moves to the central bank, can spill the beans after he is out.The media frenzy to find Rajans successor reminds one of what had happened when Ratan Tata was retiring as chairman of Tata Sons. The long list, published over months, had many names from India and overseas but not Cyrus P. Mistry who actually succeeded him when Tata retired in December 2012. No one will be surprised if a dark horse emerges from nowhere for the governors post.Whoever comes may not have an easy job at hand. In the past one month, since Rajan announced his decision to go back to the academic world, the level of rupee has remained unchanged but the 10-year government bond yield has dropped from 7.5% to 7.27% and most bank stocks have risen, some of them substantially. Bankex, the representative industry index on BSE, has risen 7.3%. Out of 39 listed banks, only five stocks have fallenthree of them are associates of the State Bank of India, besides Central Bank of India and Punjab & Sind Bank. Among public sector banks, Punjab National Bank has risen close to 44%, Allahabad Bank 36% and Indian Bank and Canara Bank, more than 25% each. Overall, 13 state-owned banks and six private banks have risen at least 10% and as much as 44% in past one month.Clearly, the market is factoring in two thingsin the new regime, interest rate will fall and the pressure on the banks to clean up their balance sheets will be diluted. And, of course, the government will continue to infuse capital in the state-owned banks without any conditions even as the brainstorming on bank consolidation to create a few large banks will continue for years without any solution in sight. Meeting the expectations of the market, the banking system and the government is no mean job.

1.0,"Raj Dutt, a 35-year-old home furnishing retailer in Srinagar was among the many affected by the political turmoil in Kashmir. However, this did not dampen his entrepreneurial spirit and he found an innovative solutiona digital solution. 
				   
				Dutt leveraged the newly-launched sales assistant iPad app from a leading home furnishing company to create a new way of doing business. He went to his customers homes, showcasing the now digital product catalogue, helping them visualize interiors on the app itself and taking orders on the spot or bringing over the shortlisted fabric samples when needed. Now imagine doing this without the app, which would need him to carry close to 200 sample books to choose from, each weighing 10-15kg, for each home visit. In Dutts epic journey we find a true representation of the impact a thoughtfully-crafted digital solution can create in the right hands. Digital disruption in retail is often thought of as just a way of creating a new channel to sell, own or aggregate products or services via a cool app or e-commerce marketplace. But the true potential and value of digital is far more ubiquitous.For instance, geo-analytics, complemented by rich consumer data, today allows you to pinpoint exactly the right micro-markets for, say, a handset brand to launch new stores insomething that was based on experience earlier.Digital is not all about business-to-consumer (B2C). In B2B companies, lets say auto components, one of the top needs for customers quite often is transparency of order status and timely updates. Digital provides a strong way of seamlessly creating a platform where the customer can track his order from acceptance to manufacturing and from transport and delivery with pro-active intimation on potential delaysmaking his/her life much simpler. The advantages are manifold but the journey is never easy.We believe there are six key pillars for a successful digital transformation.Disruption and innovationRedefining the business model, from selling to servicing to feedback and improvement, is one of the first steps in the journey. More times than not, the consumer wont have answers you need directly (e.g. Henry Fords famous quip that if he were to ask his customers what they wanted, he would have built faster horses). Our lines of inquiry need to leverage trained specialists to tap into the discipline of ethnographic research and understand unmet or latent needs. Amazon Echo Dot or Google Home are excellent examples of creating a new needa digital assistant that is a news reader, home lighting controller, travel agent and Wikipedia rolled into one.Customer journeys re-imaginedDefining seamless and integrated consumer journeys across all touch-points is next. If technology has defined progress in the last decade, then design thinking is the flavour of the next one. Imagine someone refurnishing their home can shortlist the fabrics you like on your app while commuting, visualize the shortlisted products as upholstery or curtains on your laptop, get advice from family and friends and finally find the nearest store to touch the actual fabric and complete the purchaseall through beautifully designed screens in a few clicks.Agile development and launch Executing these ambitions requires a considered approachchoosing the right partners and technology platform, getting the data right, even finding the right product photography solution to a life-like product display, testing the digital product and planning the digital marketing right. The focus has to be on creating the MVP (minimum viable product) and then enhancing and refining it through each sprint for iterative upgrades.Creating data and analyst capability Data is the new oil, it is said, and the key here is unlocking consumer data at the front end and operations data at the back end. It is possible today to target a person, who searched for a car, with an auto-insurance offer that is customized for him depending on his profile (demographics, interests) at another website that he frequents. Every penny of yours can be optimized to target the right person in the right geography at the right time and the right place to personalize the right offering and maximize the return on investment.Adoption and commercializationEach digital investment should have a clear lens on commercial value, tracked actively through a sharply-defined dashboard. Adoption is among the toughest challenges in the journeyespecially, converting a users interest to not only, say, a potential download, but actual usage, transaction and, most important (but most difficult), repeat engagementwhile at the same time, doing so at the least cost per click.Digitization of processA chain is as good as the weakest link. A sports car chassis with an 800cc engine will not create an optimum consumer experienceneither will the most-innovatively designed agile customer process with a 1990s back-end. Hence, digitizing of the core processes through a clear integrated view of the information technology (IT) architecture and associated applications and making choices around niche versus diverse platforms needs thoughtful consideration.Digital is a realityit is not a dotcom boom or bust. It is already the current way of working and organizations have a choiceto embrace itor die.Rajiv Gupta is partner and head of technology advantage practice, Bharat Mimani is project leader, and Amrita Chang is consultant at BCG India.",2017-01-16,K52MthnRAmw8bKYv3TkwHN,Digital provides a strong way of seamlessly creating a platform where the customer can track his order from acceptance to manufacturing and from transport and delivery with pro-active intimation on potential delays,00:45,How to unlock a brands true digital potential
1.0,"Rohini Nilekani, chairperson and founder of not-for-profit Arghyam, is a former journalist, writer and philanthropist. She co-founded Pratham Books, a non-profit publishing enterprise to produce high-quality, low-cost books for children in several Indian languages. Nilekani has been involved in development issues for several years. In an interview, she sp aks about how the wealthy can be persuaded to give more to charity, why access to natural resources is important for improving lives and the India Philanthropy Initiative. Edited excerpts from the interview conducted by Bridgespan in partnership with Mint: 
One of the under-reported elements in the new strategic philanthropy era is the element of personal reward and the joy that comes from philanthropy. What do you consider to be your most rewarding philanthropic experiences recently?Yes, you are absolutely right that our brains are wired for altruism and what keeps altruism going in the human race is the actual joy you get out of it. You have to watch out that it doesnt turn into a sort of ego-driven joy. But when I meet children reading the books we published at Pratham Books, it gives me the most undiluted joy. But also at a more fundamental level, being able to work with communities to improve their water resources and then to see what a difference it makes, especially to the lives of women. We have helped with spring restoration, for example, and when communities are able to get sustainable, safe water, thats been a deep fundamental satisfaction as well. Can you give an example or idea where philanthropy can change the power structure?One of the great conundrums in philanthropy globally is that the way wealth creation happens itself often creates the inequities in society. In the ideal world, philanthropy should be redundant or at least it should be at the edges, as innovation or risk capital. But its far from an ideal world; the wealthy are cornering more and more opportunities and resources from this planet. So, the big challenge for philanthropy iscan it engage with the distribution of wealth itself? It is very difficult, let me tell you. Once you are wealthy, you are in a nice comfort zone and want to stay there. So I always look in the mirror and ask, is my philanthropy making the world a more just and fair place? Take the water example; because when people dont have access to water, its very hard to have good health, good income and livelihoods, so I think the work on water is about restructuring power. So also with some of the other work that I do on ecology, I think peoples access to the natural resource base really does make a difference in how they can bootstrap themselves up to a better life.What can be done or needs to be done to stimulate the newly wealthy in India? I think those who are already in philanthropy and enjoying it and making a difference have a responsibility to share their stories widely, and to be very transparent about their giving. That is very necessary in India today. There also needs to be public pressure on the wealthy, and government policy should make it easier to give. The regulatory cholesterol around setting up charitable organizations can be cleaned up. I think enabling non-profits, which are essentially the absorptive pipeline for philanthropy, is critical. And right now there is distrust between government and NGOs (non-governmental organizations), which I think is not healthy. So we do need government and NGOs to sit at the table and say how can we make the NGO sector more transparent? How can we then have less regulation and make it easier to function? I think all this will help to increase philanthropy in India.Can you talk a little bit about the role of big bets in India? Is there a need for more strategic action?I think we have seen international philanthropists take these audacious big bets and obviously the (Bill and Melinda) Gates Foundation comes to my mind, when they deploy their capital to crack some vaccine or child mortality. I mean that sounds like the kind of areas we used to leave to God or at least to the big state! But it is wonderful that people who have become so incredibly wealthy are now putting their intellectual capital along with their monetary capital to say, why cant we just be audacious and crack things that have just not cracked for so long? It has its risks; it always has its risks when individuals use their power and wealth to solve something because unless it comes with a set of checks and balances in society, sometimes you can also go very wrong. But I am all for these big bets and in India I dont think we have taken enough of them. I hope we mature to that.You are involved with other philanthropists in establishing and leading Indian philanthropic initiatives...The India Philanthropy Initiative was set up by a few of us under Azim Premjis leadership. We have decided to take it slowly but the goal is to see how we can inspire much more philanthropy in India. We are learning to see if we can be effective as a group of philanthropists, pushing each others limit. And we are best as a peer-to-peer network where we can freely ask questions and learn.ALSO READ | You really want to be doing things that make a difference: Ratan TataDo you think the expression and experience of philanthropy in India can be distinctive?It can be made distinctive. If we really get back into the roots of our culture and philosophy, we can bring that out into the modern era by infusing it with new meaning about responsibility in society. And you can make it as spiritual as you want it to be or make it just about creating a better democracy. So yes, there is potential to infuse Indian philanthropy with a deeply culturally rooted new meaning. And that is a journey worth taking I think.ALSO READ | Being positive is not a curseALSO READ | Growth of wealth gives way for growth in charityThe Bridgespan Group, an adviser and resource for mission-driven leaders and organizations, in partnership with Mint interviewed several philanthropists across India to trace their journeys and share their learningsConversations with Remarkable Givers: India.

0.25,"On Saturday, 5 November, India hosted the ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) 57 meeting in Hyderabad. If the Internet has a backbone, ICANN is it. From its inception in 1998 until 1 October this year, it was based in and controlled by the US. That the first summit after the US ceded control was held in India makes for neat symbolism. But if New Delhi wishes India to have a significant say in global Internet governance going forwarda mustit will have to go beyond mere symbolism.
				   
				ICANNs history is a study in the tensions between traditional state power and the decentralised nature of the Internet. Back in the dark ages of the Internet when only a handful of websites existed, American computer scientist Jon Postel administered the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). This is the body responsible for delegating and managing domain names and Internet protocol addresses globallywhat makes it possible for someone to go to the correct website when they type, say, livemint.com. In 1998, management of IANA was taken over by ICANN, a private sector, non-profit body created for this purpose. But crucially, ICANN answered to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration of the US Department of Commerce. In essence, the US government controlled vital Internet infrastructure.This has been a point of contention in recent years. To be fair, successive US governments have used their suzerainty sparingly and fairly. But other states have been understandably unwilling to bank on Washingtons goodwill and ethical fibre in this matter of global security, economic activity and development. India has been one of them. However, its stand has been confused and wrongheaded at various points. The primary point of contention has been whether a multilateral governance approachone in which national governments would be the primary stakeholders and agentsor a multi-stakeholder approach that would incorporate a variety of voices from civil society, the private sector and academia, is best suited to succeed the US.The latter wins out on several fronts. The decentralised, transnational nature of the Internet has underpinned its innovation and economic and developmental benefits. Ringfencing crucial governance issues from the multiple non-state stakeholders that have made it what it isand worse, subjecting it to the bureaucratic wrangling that is inevitable in any multilateral bodywould be highly counterproductive. But, as Arun Mohan Sukumar points out in The Wire, despite then-information technology minister Kapil Sibal paying lip service to multi-stakeholderism in 2012, the previous administration sent confusing signals, pushing at various points for a greater government role in Internet governance.Thankfully, current IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasads unequivocal statement last year about an Indian vision for the Internetone that sees multi-stakeholderism as the only way forwardshows that the Narendra Modi government has settled upon a cohesive, sensible approach. This is a pragmatic decision given that the proponents of a multilateral approach included China and Russiaand under the circumstances, Washington had made it clear it would not cede control of ICANN to an inter-governmental body. The problem, however, is that given Indias track record so far, converting its support for a multi-stakeholder model into an actionable approach that gives it a voice in shaping future outcomes is going to take some doing.    On Saturday, Prasad chided the Indian private sector for not participating in global policymaking processes related to the Internet. He was right as far as it goes. But he failed to mention that Indian involvement in generalincluding at the governmental levelhas been anemic through the years at ICANN summits and other such forums. At a time when the Modi government has explicitly recognised the transformational potential of the Internetboth economically and for quality of governancevia the Digital India initiative, New Delhi cannot afford a low level of engagement with the global policymaking apparatus that will shape its future.Perhaps the first step to redressing the current state of affairs is looking at the domestic policymaking process in Internet-related issues. A Centre for Communication Governance report, Analysing Indian Engagement at Global Internet Governance Institutions 2011-2015 by Puneeth Nagaraj and Aarti Bhavana notes that the small number of civil society, academic and government representatives who have participated in global governance forums so far have shared concerns regarding accountability, legitimacy, diversity and capacity. Thats well and goodexcept that when it comes to freedom of expression, website blocking, policy issues such as the encryption bill and the geospatial bill, and a multitude of other such issues, successive governments have been unconcerned with the need to engage civil society and technical experts adequately.The capabilities and willingness to participate in global governance at the international level will not come into existence in a vacuum. They must first be cultivated at the domestic level. The future of the Internet is too important to leave to governments alone.How should India pursue Internet governance both domestically and globally?

0.91,"Shares of Voltas Ltd, a capital goods firm from the Tata Group with a strong presence in the air conditioning market, closed 4% higher on Friday.
				   
				The trigger is perhaps the strong indication of a better year for retail air conditioner sales.This segment accounts for half the revenue clocked in its domestic operations. Dealers say sales in January were better than what it was last year, and discounts were lower, too.A recent report by Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd says that in a recent exhibition on heating, ventilating and air conditioning, manufacturers were showcasing new products or energy-efficient variants, optimistic of good sales in the coming summer.Last years inventory pile-up, due to a less severe summer, had been drawn down during the October-November festive season.Meanwhile, the sales of larger commercial air conditioners used by hotels, retail stores, educational institutions and offices are hotting up, too. Together, the segment, which is called the unitary cooling products (UCP) division, has shown decent growth. Voltass market share rose by about 300 basis points  over the last two years. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Unfortunately, the companys engineering and electro-mechanical projects (EMP) businesses have been the spoilers for some quarters in the recent past. Voltas significant presence in the international markets, especially in the Gulf, marred performance due to delays in project execution and payments. The EMP segment even posted a loss in the December quarter, faring worse than the Streets expectation. Add to this weak order inflows: a situation that is unlikely to change in the near term with the low oil price raising concerns regarding capex in these regions.On home ground, too, it may be a while before large industrial and infrastructure orders pick up. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) for January declined more than anticipated, led by weakness in manufacturing. Like most companies in the capital goods pack, Voltas, too, will see gains in the last leg of the capex cycle, as that is when its products are installed.But, on the whole, theres a spark of investor confidence in the firm on account of improving sales in the UCP business. It will continue only if the other project segments performance is not threatened.",2016-03-14,Lis1qJ8dUKqSUpTeZKhlZI,"The trigger is perhaps the strong indication of a better year for retail air conditioner sales

				Comparatively the country as a whole has seen a growth of 5.1% during the period. Consumption is high in states where rainfall is low. Tamil Nadu, which has been declared drought-hit by the state government, saw a 12% rise in electricity usage. Karnataka, which also saw scanty rains, has seen a 10% rise in power usage, points out Motilal Oswal, citing data from Central Electricity Authority.CSR adoption by Indian companies on the riseThe spending of listed Indian companies on corporate social responsibility (CSR) is rising and the proportion of firms spending closer to 2% of profits is going up, according to a report by Crisil Foundation. Spending on CSR was up by 22% in fiscal year 2016 over a year ago. Larger companies reported improved compliance, with 53% of those with sales of over Rs10,000 crore spending 2% or more of profit on CSR during FY16, compared to 31% in the year earlier. Among smaller firms, 57% with sales of Rs100-500 crore and 56% with sales of Rs500-10,000 crore reported spending 2% or more. Of course, this can also be seen as a cup half empty, as there is a long way to go before a majority of companies become compliant with the 2% spending rule. Three sectors most responsible for the underperformance are information technology, telecom and financial services, which together contribute one-third of the net profit of listed firms.EM commodity exporters surprise on the trade frontWhatever good news there is in emerging markets (EMs) trade data is largely a story about commodity exporters, Citi Research said in a report last week.

Citi does caution about data limitations, as it generates data from a small group of countries but says its conclusion fits with two other facts. Firstly, there has been a highly visible recovery in commodity prices.

0.25,"Bengaluru: Wipro Ltd, which launched its artificial intelligence (AI) platform Holmes 18 months ago, is now making its biggest push to embrace automation by allowing more of its managers to identify work which will not require engineers in each of the over 20,000 projects currently underway.
				   
				This bold development, according to one executive who did not want to be identified will mean Wipro doesnt just save on costs (thereby arresting falling profitability), but fundamentally alters the traditional model of deploying armies of engineers to undertake maintenance work.To be sure, that could also mean that its current workforce needs to learn new technology skills swiftly to stay relevant.Wipro is in the process of appointing individual leaders in each of the six industry-serving segments (which the company calls strategic business units) and five solution offering verticals or practices, who will be entrusted with the job of automating mundane maintenance work.Until now, Wipros chief technology officer K.R. Sanjiv, in consultation with various segment heads used to decide which projects could use Holmes. Wipros two larger rivals, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd, too have a similar centralized division that oversees the adoption of their respective intelligent automation platforms, Ignio and Mana. This explains why these companies, which employ hundreds of thousands of engineers, have embraced automation only in tiny pockets.At Wipro, this will now change. We announced internally in this quarter that we will have a more federated structure than running it from a central unit, which will further increase the pace (of adoption), Abidali Neemuchwala, chief executive officer of Wipro said last month.Hyper-automation is one of the central pillars of Neemuchwalas vision of making Wipro a $15 billion firm by 2020 with an operating margin of 23%. Wipro ended the year to March with $7.35 billion in revenue and 20.5% profitability. Wipro is consolidating all its automation assets and capabilities under the Holmes brand and significantly increasing its investment in hyper-automation. Going forward, every strategic business unit, service line and delivery unit will have dedicated leaders for Holmes, said a spokesperson for Wipro. They will be responsible for adoption of the existing capability and ideation of new use cases.In the first six months of the current financial year, Wipro claims to have freed and redeployed over 4,300 employees in newer areas of work, on account of automation. The managements decision to decentralize decision-making means Wipro could look to automate work of close to 10,000 engineers by the end of the financial year, according to a second executive who spoke on condition of anonymity.We are well ahead of our plan for the financial year. (But) we will not be able to provide information beyond what has so far been disclosed publicly, said the spokesperson.Experts are encouraged by the managements decision.Aligned with a market maturation around the broad notion of Intelligent Automation, Wipro is changing gears in the way it is engaging with stakeholders, said Thomas Reuner, the managing director at IT outsourcing advisory, HfS Research.Each of these Holmes leaders will be evaluated on the work they can automate. All of them will have individual targets, said the second executive. Until now, much of the work (that has been automated) is what is maintenance or L0 type. Hopefully, as we push automation, more L1 or L2 (higher order) work in areas such as application development or even software writing can be automated.Wipros aggressive push towards embracing automation comes at a time when automation platforms and cloud computing are threatening to erase the labour arbitrage enjoyed by Indian IT vendors.Still, Wipro, which has focused on demonstrating robust delivery and learning the lessons from the early deployments of its AI platform, will now, much like its peers, demonstrate that it can manage the transition from labour arbitration to automation in profitable manner, said Reuner.",2016-11-02,MfyyMa0zsQOTnJQGmZqHqK,Wipro is appointing individual leaders in each of the six industry-serving segments and five solution-offering verticals to reduce mundane maintenance work,04:35,Wipro in biggest automation push since launch of Holmes AI platform

In constant currency terms, it is up 5.4% from the September quarter (Q2). In comparison, HCL Technologies Ltd, which reported a strong performance, has seen its constant currency revenue rise 3% on a sequential basis.
				   
				As in the case of HCL Technologies, Tech Mahindra also benefited from inorganic growth initiatives. Even then, reported growth surpassed Street estimates. Kotak Institutional Equities, for instance, was expecting constant currency revenue growth of 3.8%.Tech Mahindras Q3 profit up 14% to Rs856 croreThe growth is led by BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) and retail, transport and logistics verticals. Communications, which is still the single largest business vertical for Tech Mahindra, registered 1.7% sequential growth in revenue. In constant currency terms, the division is said to have grown by 3%.Where the company did not impress or exceed expectations is profitability. Despite the favourable baseQ2 has seen one-time restructuring expensesthe Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin expanded just 80 basis points to 15.7%. According to an analyst with a domestic broking firm, adjusting for the Q2 restructuring expense, the margin would drop 40 basis points. But then, as the analyst clarifies, margins can see volatility on a quarterly basis as the company integrates recent acquisitions. A basis point is 0.01%.Management commentary otherwise is encouraging.

				MAIN SECTIONMistry familys allegations Mismanagement at Tata Sons and oppression of minority shareholdersRatan Tata abused the powers vested in him as the erstwhile chairman of the Tata group in terms of the various businesses entered into which includes Nano car project, acquisition of Corus, Tata Teleservices, Air Asia, dealings C. Sivasankaran and M Pallonji & Co.Corporate governance breakdown and excessive interference by Tata TrustsTata and other trustees, acting as shadow directors, have been controlling Tata Sons as a super-board with trustee-nominated directors accustomed to act under the instructions of Tata Trusts, which hold 66% in Tata Sons. The trustees sought to micro manage the governance of Tata Sons.Illegal removal of the executive chairmanThe executive chairman was removed without any notice or explanation. Abuse of articles of associationThe article of associations of Tata Sons, whose aim was to have a governance framework to protect the firms interests, have been converted into a regime enabling the control of Tata Sons by Ratan Tata and Noshir Soonawala, trustees of the Tata Trusts.Violation of insider trading normsLaw violations by Tata and Noshir Soonawala , a trustee for procuring unpublished price sensitive information from listed Tata companies.Tata Sons responseIssues raised are nothing but a ruse by Cyrus Mistry. This is merely to publicly express his displeasure at the loss of his office as the executive chairman of Tata Sons. It is an attempt to besmirch the reputation of the Tata group.Mistrys removal not illegalMistrys removal was resolved upon by a majority of the directors (seven out of nine directors who voted in favour of Mistrys removal as the executive chairman).Mistry was well acquainted with the affairs of Tata Sons and the Tata group  This was much before Mistry became the executive chairman in December 2012. He was part of the boards deliberations in respect of several decisions which he is now attempting to call into question.Why now? Mistry is seeking to justify the inexplicable delay by the petitioner in availing judicial remedies. He did not take the requisite step to address the alleged mismanagement and oppression nor did he bring it to the notice of the board of Tata Sons. He rose from slumber to voice this grievance only after he was removed.Allegations levelled against Ratan Tata misconceived All decisions at Tata Sons and Tata companies have been taken by the relevant management teams. In his own draft presentation Mistry had proposed an active and consistent engagement with the trusts and the trust nominee directors.No special treatment to C. Sivasankaran The allegations with respect to the instances of dealings with C. Sivasankaran, chairman of the Siva group, are not relevant to the present proceedings for alleged oppression of the petitioners and alleged mismanagement of the affairs of Tata Sons. There is absolutely nothing on record to suggest that these transactions involved a degree of undue favour or special treatment at the behest of Tata group companies.Flawed business decision do not tantamount to acts of oppression Assuming but without conceding that these business decisions were in fact flawed and imprudent, such transactions do not tantamount to acts of oppression or mismanagement as is the settled legal position.What Mistry family has asked the NCLTWind up Tata Sons board and appointment of an administrator or appoint a retired Supreme Court judge as the non-executive chairman and appoint new independent directors.Restrain the so-called interim chairman from attending any meeting of the board of directors.Restrain Noshir Soonawala from interfering in the affairs of Tata Sons.Direct Tata Sons to not issue any securities which could lead to a dilution in the present equity capital.Restraint the respondent to the petition which includes Tata Sons, Tata Trusts and Ratan Tata from making any changes to the article of association unless its done with the consent of the honourable tribunal.Appoint an independent auditor to conduct a forensic accounting and independent investigations into the transactions of Air Asia, involving Mehli Mistry and associated entities, C. Sivasankaran and his business entities. And submit a report to the tribunal.Appoint an inspector to investigate into the of Sebis prohibition of insider trading breach by Ratan Tata and Noshir Soonawala and submit a report to the tribunal so that it can refer the findings to the Serious Fraud Investigation Office of the ministry of corporate affairs.Appoint a forensic auditor to re-investigateDirect Tata Trusts to bring back into Tata Sons the funds used by Tata Sons for acquiring shares of Tata Motors.Restrain Tata Sons from entering any new line of business or acquiring any new business without the consent of the tribunal and that to after it has been discussed with the board of directors without applying 121 of article of association.Restrain the trustees from interfering in affairs of Tata Sons and various companies that are part of Tata group.Restrain the existing selection committee from discharging any duty and appoint a new committee.Direct that no candidate selected by the committee pursuant to the article 118 of the article of association of Tata Sons be appointed without the consent of the Tribunal.Direct Tata Sons not to demand unpublished price sensitive information from any listed Tata group companyPass an order which is in the interest of justice and brings an end to the acts of oppression and mismanagement.SECOND SECTION Face-off: Ratan Tata vs Cyrus MistryThe genesis of the current crisis emanated from the personality differences between the then chairman of Tata Sons and chairman emeritus. Here are the few key issues which became the bone of contention between the two.Allegations against Ratan TataA chairman who never retired.His insistence of being a super board by wanting to pre-vet and pre-decide what gets formal approval to the Tata Sons board shows he was never happy being chairman emeritus but saw himself as chairman who never retired.Board of Tata Sons removed Mistry at the behest of Ratan Tata.It was under the influence of Tata that the board ousted Mistry.Remote controlling operations of Tata group companies.Tata was seeking to control key decisions in key Tata group companies through abuse and misuse of article of association. Any deviation from the approach sought by him would be attacked by him as a violation of articles of association.Aviation misadventure, Nano car project and flawed overseas acquisition strategy. Ratan Tatas passion for flying and aviation industry in general led the Tata group into aviation business. Every decision in the sector relating to Taj Air, B Jets, Piaggio Aero and more recently AirAsia and Vistara has inflicted serious damage to Tata group and to Tata Sons interests.As there is no line of sight to profitability for the Nano, any turnaround strategy for the company requires to shut it down. Emotional reasons alone have kept the company away from this crucial decision. The foreign acquisition strategy, with the exceptions of JLR and Tetley, had left a large debt overhang.Friends of Ratan Tata While some of them were bestowed powers to commit serious investment decisions on behalf of the Tata Sons while others were granted extraordinary and undue favours. These include Mehli Mistry, the chairman of M. Pallonji group, won contracts from Tata Power Co. Ltd at rates much higher than the prevalent market rates, while due to the special treatment, C. Sivasankaran, chairman Siva group, made a fortune by investing in Tata Teleservices Ltd (TTSL).RATAN TATAs RESPONSEOn him being a super board The allegations are unfounded. It is at Mistrys invitation that he was made chairman emeritus. Such an invitation would not have been extended had Mistry harboured such fundamental objections to Tatas term as chairman. Even upon assuming office, Mistry continued to seek Tatas guidance and views.On Mistrys removal Mistrys removal as the chairman of Tata Sons was led by the complete erosion of confidence and widening of trust deficit amongst the board of directors of Tata Sons and a similar trust deficit between Mistry and Tata Sons principal shareholders.On remote controlling operations Tata offered his opinion only on being asked by Mistry and his views were not unsolicited. Tata also presented his well-intentioned point of view and shared his thoughts wherever he felt that doing so would further the best interests of Tata group. To now colour this as interference amounting to a case of oppressive conduct is regrettable to say the least. Mistrys petition is nothing but a personal attack with a view to besmirch Tata based on false and baseless allegations.On acquisitionsThe decision to acquire Corus at the stipulated price was the unanimous and conscious decision of the entire board of directors of Tata Steel in 2007. In fact, the board of Tata Sons, including Mistry, passed a board resolution for financing the acquisition by Tata Steel.On Tatas persistent resistance to shelve Nano project  He did not raise any objections in view of the volumes and contributions being made by the project. It is entirely without basis for Mistry to contend that it was Tata who thrusted the decision to continue with Nano upon the incumbent management of Tata Motors.On aviation misadventure The investments made by Tata Sons in the aviation sector, was an unanimous decision of the board. In fact, Mistry in his webcast to all the employees of Tata group recognized Tatas contribution in the aerospace plans. The documents placed on record by Mistry himself reveal that he constantly sought Tatas advice and inputs on the issues inflicting Tata Sons in the aviation sector.Response to the allegations regarding the special relationshipsOn C. SivasankaranIt is highly unjustified that Mistrys after all these years contends that TTSL investment or any other engagement with Sivasankarans companies, was driven by personal relationships rather than the collective commercial wisdom of the board of Tata Teleservices Ltd.On Mehli MistryIt is also wrong to say that when Mistry took over as executive chairman of the Tata group, he pursued a policy of all Tata group companies awarding large contracts solely because of competitive bidding to ensure that the Tata group companies receive the maximum benefit possible from their contracts with third parties. Such statement clearly insinuates that before Mistrys tenure, the contracts were being awarded by the Tata group companies without following a due process.Sapna Agarwal contributed to this story.",2017-01-31,NUG4OYNFBmmDMQ5mHsyGvL,"The National Company Law Tribunal, or NCLT, will start hearing the petition from Tuesday  on the Tata Sons-Cyrus Mistry row",10:39,Tata Sons-Cyrus Mistry spat: What the affidavits say
1.0,"Singapore: What does Cyrus Mistry want? Ever since his summary 24 October dismissal as chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, the spurned executive has demanded a reason for his sacking from the holding company of Indias $103 billion salt-to-software conglomerate.
				   
				At the same time, Mistry, 48, has accused Ratan Tata, the 78-year-old who wrested back control of the group, of everything from a control fetish to governance failures and bad judgment. According to Mistry, Ratan Tatas 2006 purchase of Corus Group Plcs British steel assets, his vanity small-car project as well as the acquisition of pricey hotels have exposed the empire that bears his familys name to an existential threat.Some of this could just be wounded pride, but even if Mistrys allegations have a kernel of truth, what does he gain from trash-talking a group in which his family owns 18.4%? One possible answer is that he mightif he can convince enough outside investors in operating companies to side with himprize open the loosely controlled conglomerate, and pluck out a big reward.Tuesdays shareholder meeting of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, the software business, may have been a practice session in that treasure hunt. Tata Sons 73% stake in TCS was enough for Ratan Tata to get Mistry thrown out as its chairman. But at five other companiesIndian Hotels Co. Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd, Tata Chemicals Ltd and Tata Power Co. Ltdthe founding group owns less than 40%. All of them hold shareholder meetings between 13 December and 26 December to vote on Mistrys fate.Also read: What if other Tata group shareholders vote the same way as those at TCS?In three of them, he will have a formidable backer. Mistrys own core supporters, fired together with him, have no clout. But Nusli Wadia, the scion of one of Indias oldest business families, is a heavyweight. He has spent a combined 90 years on three Tata boards.At Tata Steel, where Wadia is the longest-serving independent director, hes already questioning the validity of the companys brand licensing agreement with Tata Sons, a younger company that received its first royalty payment 91 years after the steelmakers founding. Wadia wants an examination of the agreement.A similar suggestion at Tata Motors, where Wadia has been on the board for 18 years, would be a thinly veiled call for mutiny. The ultimate prize may be Jaguar Land Rover, the crowning glory of Ratan Tatas dealmaking career.Tata Sons boosted its stake in Tata Motors by 1.7% on the day of the TCS vote, and is open to buying more ahead of the 22 December extraordinary general meeting. This must be the Wadia effect. Even at TCS, retail shareholders overwhelmingly voted against Mistrys ouster. If Wadias PR spiel can swing enough of them away from Ratan Tata, the latters control of Jaguar Land Rover might be at risk, provided Mistry can raise money for an open offer to shareholders, a condition on which the market regulator may well insist. And that could split the empire.Also read: Message for Tata Sons in bittersweet victory at TCS EGMOn both sides, theres much high-minded talk about values, and how the other camp was ruining the groups reputation for fair play by cutting ethical corners.

				Twice over.In Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), a business he will lead until 21 February, Chandra, as he is popularly known, has spent almost 30 years, his entire working life.He started as a software programmer with TCS in 1987 and rose through the ranks to become one of the youngest chief executive officers (CEOs) in Tata group when he was 46 years old in 2009.Now, as he prepares to take over as chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, Chandrasekaran is in effect getting ready to run another marathon.He is 53 and the retirement age for top Tata executives is 70, giving him a potential 17 years at the helm of the $103-billion group that has businesses ranging from salt to steel and tea to telecom.Running a marathon is also a metaphor for running a business, according to Chandrasekaran.You have to decide on the length of the engagement, develop endurance to handle setbacks and increase speed when the competition demands it, Chandrasekaran said in an interview to Runners World magazine in October 2015 (bit.ly/2iFOCtK).You have to perform with your heart and your mind; you will not get lost on the way if you have a good road map; you will get nowhere without discipline. This is what I always tell my employees in speeches, he said.He will start running his new marathon at a time when Tata group is in the midst of a bruising battle with its former chairman, Cyrus Mistry, who was sacked on 24 October in a boardroom putsch, less than four years after he succeeded family scion Ratan Tata.Also read: Tata vs Mistry: NCLT dismisses contempt of court plea filed by Mistry firmsThe feud between Mistry, who has accused the 149-year old business house of a variety of corporate governance violations, and Tata has reached the National Company Law Tribunal, or NCLT, where a long and messy legal battle is looming.The Mistry family is the largest minority shareholder in Tata Sons, the holding company of the group.We are at an inflection point, Chandrasekaran wrote in an emailed statement after his appointment. I am aware that this role comes with huge responsibilities. It will be my endeavour to help progress the group with the ethos, ethics and values that the Tata group has been built on.A Tata Sons spokesperson said the chairman-designate was not available for interviews immediately.Chandrasekaran, we believe will now inspire the entire Tata group to realize its potential acting as leaders in their respective businesses, always in keeping with our value system and ethics and adhering with the practices of the Tata group which have stood it in good stead, the Tata Sons board said in a statement on 12 January while announcing his elevation. The five-member selection committee chose him unanimously, it added.Also read: Tata Sons new chairman has twin obstaclesa family and a conglomerateChandrasekaran would be no stranger to the value systems and the practices that the board is talking about. The man who would have been a farmer joined the company after completing his Masters degree in computer applications from the Regional Engineering College in Trichy, Tamil Nadu. Over time, he has worked in a variety of positions (chief operating officer, executive assistant to S. Ramadorai, the previous CEO), and places (California and Stockholm). In that sense, he is an insider.He is an outsider because he is the first truly professional chairman of the Tata Sons board who is not related to the Tata family.Nowroji Saklatwala, the third chairman of the group, was the nephew of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of Tata group. Cyrus Mistry is the brother-in-law of Noel Tata, half brother of Ratan Tata.This can be interpreted in two ways: Either the Tatas chose a safe option by choosing an insider, or the group took a step forward to regain its tarnished credibility by choosing a non-family memberand one with a proven track recordto lead the firm.Also read: N. Chandrasekaran begins long road to restoring Tata groups imageIndeed, Chandrasekarans first task will be to restore the reputation of the group and the sheen of brand Tata.A day after his ouster, Mistry (in a letter that subsequently found its way into the public domain) said the Tata group was beset with a host of corporate governance issues.The group was staring at a potential $18-billion write-down, he claimed. It persisted with a loss-making project, the Nano small car, because it was an obsession with Ratan Tata; there was undue interference from some of the trustees of the Tata Trusts, which own two-thirds of Tata Sons; some friends and associates of Ratan Tata benefited from Tata group contractsthey all were a part of Mistrys lists of allegations.Subsequently, the listed companies of the Tata group lost 6.1% (till 16 January) of their market capitalization, and regulators began asking questions.The controversy at Tata group is not his (Chandrasekarans) creation. He just needs to ride it out. I think if he can build a reasonably supportive relationship with Cyrus, it will be good for the image of corporate India, said Ganesh Natarajan, vice-chairman at Zensar Technologies Ltd, who has worked with Chandrasekaran at software industry lobby Nasscom.Restoring the reputation is just a start. The fact remains that the Tata group has several underperformers. The so-called legacy hot spots which were named by MistryTata Power Co. Ltds Mundra plant in western Gujarat, Tata Steel Europe, Indian Hotels Co. Ltd, Tata Teleservices Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd passenger vehiclesall are pressure points.For instance, in the four years to fiscal 2016, Tata Steel has taken an impairment charge of at least Rs24,175 crore, most of it attributed to the European assets that it acquired with the 2007 purchase of Corus Group Plc for £6.7 billion (Rs54,000 crore today).In the past fiscal, losses at Coastal Gujarat Power Ltd (CGPL), which houses the Mundra plant, were Rs1,491.86 crore.Looking at data aggregated between 2011 and 2015 and limit the analysis largely to the legacy hot spots, it will show that the capital employed in those companies has risen from Rs1.32 trillion to Rs1.96 trillion A realistic assessment of the fair value of these businesses could potentially result in a write-down over time of Rs1.18 trillion, Mistry pointed out in his letter.But it wont be easy to rejuvenate these businesses. Selling or exiting them wont be a quick option since it will call into question the business wisdom and legacy of group patriarch Ratan Tata.Look at Tata Steel. Corus is a disaster, said T.V. Mohandas Pai, chairman of Manipal Global Education and former board of director at Infosys Ltd. Cyrus tried to change that by selling assets, but they ousted him as they said it was against Tata values, said Pai.Tata values, he said, cannot be based on destruction of shareholders value.Pai terms Chandrasekaran as a go getter who is great at marketing and building relationships, but he is not sure if he will get the much-needed free hand to run Tata Sons.Once he takes charge at Tata Sons, the key issue wont be whether he will be able to do well, but whether he will have operational freedom, he said.This talk of freedom to operate that Pai is talking about goes to the crux of Mistrys accusations.Mistry, in his 25 October letter, said he had been reduced to the position of a lame duck chairman.He accused Tata Trusts and some of the trusteesRatan Tata and Noshir Soonawala, in particularof excessive interference in the running of listed Tata companies.Documents filed by the Mistry family firmsCyrus Investments Pvt. Ltd and Sterling Investments Pvt. Ltdin NCLT alleged mismanagement of Tata Sons and oppression of minority shareholders, cited some examples and called them shadow directors.These charges have been strongly refuted by Tata and Soonawala in affidavits they filed in reply.Also read: Why Natarajan Chandrasekaran is a safe choice for Ratan TataLeaving this issue aside, Chandrasekaran will anyway have to establish a good working relationship with the principal shareholders of Tata Sons, both in terms of navigating the three-tier structure of the groupTata Trusts, Tata Sons and Tata group operating companiesand in meeting their expectations.Already, the trustees have come out with statements highlighting their concerns.The new leadership at Tata Sons should ensure that the overall profitability and income of the group improves, and the dividend payout by Tata Sons to Tata Trusts not only stabilizes but also increases, said V.R. Mehta, a trustee of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, in an interview, a day after Chandrasekarans elevation was announced.The main worry of the trust was the decline in the dividend income of Tata Sons from the operating companies, he said.In a 10 November statement, Tata Sons had pointed out that with the exception of TCS, all 40 other firms (many non-dividend paying) in its portfolio paid dividends that have continuously declined from Rs1,000 crore in 2012-13 to Rs780 crore in 2015-16.It said even the Rs780-crore figure included an interim dividend of Rs100 crore, which would have been normally received in 2016-17. Shriram Subramanian, managing director at InGovern Reearch, a proxy advisory firm, says while Chandrasekarans capabilities are beyond doubt, he needs to ensure that better corporate governance practices prevail in the group, and he is not seen as a yes man to Ratan Tata.Also read: Chandras true test will be shutting down Tatas loss-making businesses: Aswath DamodaranIn TCS at least, Chandrasekaran has proven to be his own man as can be seen from the 2008 reorganization of the software firm into five groups, whose directors began reporting directly to him.But the challenges will be different now, when it comes to dealing with other group CEOs, many of them his peers.To some extent, Chandra will also be constrained by not having the experience of having dealt with huge debt and with bankers, said Subramanian.TCS has been the cash cow of Tata group. It accounts for around 17.5% of the total revenue of the conglomerate. It is the company which spews cash to fund Tata ventures into newer businesses, allowing Tata Sons to act like a private equity investor.Chandrasekarans role so far has been to keep it running smoothly and build on the gains made previously; under him, TCSs market capitalization and revenues grew more than three times. But now, he needs to figure out ways to replicate his success with TCS in unfamiliar businesses.The culture in the IT (information technology) industry is one of youthful exuberance, service orientation, technological innovation and collaborative learningan antithesis to the rough and tough shop-floor realities of old-world industries, wrote Prabal Basu Roy, a Sloan Fellow from the London Business School and a chartered accountant, in a column on 14 January. Therefore, this cultural and skill set mismatch will be a major challengethough charismatic leadership can overcome some of this.But such concerns are brushed aside by Tata insiders.Also read: The many challenges of Natarajan ChandrasekaranIf the group chairman knows everything, it will create over dependence and everyone would look upon him rather than doing it on their own, said K. Santhanakrishnan, non-executive and non-independent director at Tata Global Beverages Ltd. The group needs his soft skills. The hardware already exists in the form of professionally managed boards and professional executive management. His experience in the software industry which has linkages with all the sectors and his wide international exposure and acceptability across, would really help the group.Chandrasekaran takes charge at a time when the group needs a strategic reorientation. With the election of Donald Trump, who has vowed to protect American jobs, as US President and the shift in customers spending patterns from traditional IT services to a digital domain, TCS itself is going to face tough times and may not be able to sustain its dividend track record.At the same time, tough calls have to be made to bring down group debt, which stands at Rs2.25 trillion, and which new businesses to focus on.The reactions I get to my philosophy are heartwarming. No less than a thousand employees responded to my call to run the Mumbai Marathon together, Chandrasekaran said in the Runners World interview.To succeed in his new job and successfully complete the metaphorical marathon he is embarking on, he will need a similar response from the 660,000 employees of Tata group.",2017-01-20,PUT0dMs7Buh2WJTdbafJzM,MintAsia examines the challenges Natarajan Chandrasekaran faces  as he prepares to take the helm at Tata Sons at a time when the group is engaged in an ugly feud with its ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry,01:26,Marathon Man

Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat from California, introduced a bill last week to tighten requirements for the H-1B work visa programme.News of the draft executive order has sent Indian information technology (IT) stocks reeling this week and fuelled a sharp rise in inquiries to local placement firms from current H-1B visa holders exploring options back home.Senior executives are putting together contingency plans in the event they cant get enough workers into the US to work with their clients, which include many of Americas top banks and corporations.H1B visa reform: Why US companies are worrying about changesThe topic may well come up during a conversation between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump slated for June, Chandrashekhar said.Nasscom encompasses nearly 2,400 technology companies across the country but Chandrashekhar said the CEO delegation will comprise mainly chief executives of companies that are the biggest users of H-1B visas. He declined to name them but data show the heaviest employers include Tata Consultancy, Infosys, Wipro, HCL Technologies, Tech Mahindra and Mindtree.In New Delhi, foreign ministry spokesman Vikas Swarup said, No executive order has been signed so far. All that has happened is that three private bills have been introduced in the US House of Representatives. Such bills have been introduced in the past also and such bills have to go through the full Congressional process. So let us not prejudge the outcome.We remain in dialogue with the Trump administration and the US congress at senior levels. They are fully aware of our position on this matter, Swarup said.

				Mistrys team had prepared a governance report on issues related to the group structure, the two said, declining to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the issue. Mistry was removed before he had an opportunity to present these issues at the 24 October board meeting of Tata Sons. Tata trusts have all the rights through representation on the holding companys board to ensure that the flow of dividends for them is steady and that the company is not taking undue risks. However, the governance document sought to clarify the role of each entity and ensure that the promoters exercised their rights through their nominee directors, the two said. The root cause of the current conflict in the Tata group is the groups operating structure itself, proxy advisory firm Institutional Investors Advisory Services said in a 12 November note. Tata trusts exert control over Tata Sons, which exerts control over operating companies, several of which are publicly traded and subject to scrutiny by external stakeholders including shareholders, the note said.ALSO READ | Cyrus Mistry rebuts Tatas takeover bid claimThe governance document, the two people cited above said, is important in view of the events that culminated in the boardroom coup. On 24 October, the board of Tata Sons (with the exception of Ishaat Hussain and Farida Khambata) voted to remove Mistry as chairman. The new directors who were appointed on 25 August could not have had enough information to judge Mistrys performance, especially since their orientation programme was scheduled only on 2 November and 15 November, the people cited above said.On 8 August, the chairman of Tata trusts, Ratan Tata, sent a letter to the board of Tata Sons nominating Venu Srinivasan and Ajay Piramal as additional directors in his personal capacity. This bypassed the Tata Sons boards nomination and remuneration committee, and while it is within the law, it constitutes bad governance, these persons said. In the 25 August shareholder meeting, Tata Sons, with two-thirds ownership, confirmed the appointment of Piramal and Srinivasan. Because Tata trusts have the powers to nominate one-third of the board, Amit Chandra was appointed as a director the next day.ALSO READ | Will do whatever it takes to deal with Cyrus Mistry ouster: Tata SonsWe have said whatever we had to say in the 10 November statement, said a Tata group spokesperson.

Shareholders of Tata Industries Ltd on Monday removed Cyrus Mistry as director.
				   
				While the EGMs, to some extent, will end the indecisiveness facing the listed entities, its unlikely to bring the curtain down any time soon on one of the biggest corporate feuds seen in the recent past. If anything its going to be protracted battle with both sides likely to seek legal recourse and seeking intervention from market regulator and the government.Here is a quick analysis of the possible scenarios that are likely to emerge:If Tata Sons wins...Mistry gets removed as the director from the boards of various companies. He will also cease to be the chairman at firms where he continues to hold the position. Tata has ousted Mistry as chairman of Tata Consultancy Services, Tata Global Beverages Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd. He continues to be the chairman of Tata Motors Ltd, Tata Chemicals Ltd, Tata Power Co. Ltd and Indian Hotel and Co Ltd. However, Mistrys ejection from the board of Tata companies may not warrant peace to Tatas, said legal experts. Being a shareholder (18.5%) in Tata Sons he can continue to fight. Even if he is ousted, he has the right to arouse his grievances as he has been in the management and is also a shareholder, said a corporate lawyer who declined to be identified. Also read: Tata: 1, Mistry: 0, but this fight has just begunAlso, shareholders who believe Mistry has been wronged can approach the market regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India or Sebi, and the government to intervene and probe for insider trading, disclosure norms and financial discipline.If Mistry wins...He continues to be a director on the boards of all the operating companies. Tata Sons will have no option left but to take the legal recourse to remove him from the board of companies. Such a scenario may lead to a divided board which is not in the interest of the larger stakeholders of the company, said Kavil Ramachandran, executive director, Thomas Schmidheiny Centre for Family Enterprise, Indian School of Business. A divided board is not good for any organization, he said pointing out that it will also have an adverse impact on the plans and decisions taken by the board.

While IiAss Tandon believes the current crisis is an opportunity for the group to fix its structural issues not every one agrees. ISBs Ramachandran said while there is a need to revisit the current structure it should have its own merit and the current scenario should not be a catalyst for it. The ad-hoc decisions may not be objective, said Ramachandran pointing out that the current crisis has been borne out of personality conflict between two individuals and their priorities. I dont think it has to do with governance or the structure.

				The US administration said on Monday it had drafted an executive order to overhaul the H1B work-visa programme that software services firms based in India use to send skilled workers to the US.Alongside, a draft legislation, which among other things, calls for more than doubling the minimum salary of H1B visa holders to $130,000, was introduced in the US House of Representatives. The draft bill aims to make it difficult to replace US employees with foreign workers and experts say it is likely to deal a body blow to companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd in its present shape.ALSO READ | H1B visa reform bill introduced in US, minimum pay doubled to $130,000If implemented, the reforms may force TCS, Infosys and Wipro to make fundamental changes in their business strategies, including hiring more American workers and raising salaries they pay to employees working on client sites in the USmoves that analysts say will erode operating margins by as much as 3 percentage points.It is an adverse development, but I suspect the minimum wage limit will not rise beyond $100,000. There will be strong lobbying to curb it at that level, said Apurva Prasad, a  research analyst at HDFC Securities. Assuming the minimum wage is fixed at $100,000, the tierI Indian IT companies could take a hit of around 150-300 bps on their operating margins. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.

The average annual wage for a TCS employee on a H1B visa is $69,658, according to the note. Its higher for Infosy at $79,176.The contentious H1B visas are given to foreign nationals in specialty occupations that generally require higher education, who according to the US government rules include engineers, computer programmers and scientists. The government awards 65,000 such visas to foreigners every year.TCS declined to comment on the development. Infosys and Wipro didnt immediately respond to a request for comment.While tech firms claim they use the H1B visas to hire highly skilled workers in areas that lack top talent, the fact that a majority of the visas are awarded to outsourcing firms from India has drawn criticism from US politicians, who claim companies such as TCS and Infosys misuse the work visa programme to bring low-level IT workers into the US.

0.47,"Mumbai: Going by the slew of measures announced in the Union budget on Wednesday, such as targeting digital transformation while discouraging cash transactions, its easy to be lulled into believing that India is well on its way to becoming a digital powerhouse.
				   
				And why not? After all, finance minister Arun Jaitley did unveil a series of post-demonetisation digital reforms, including a Rs3 lakh cap on cash transactions, which he said were aimed at fetching the government Rs2,500 crore in revenue. While the initiatives to build a digital India are undoubtedly important, we cannot ignore the fact that India has a long way to go becoming digital. Here are a few reasons:For one, India still ranks a poor 91 on the Networked Readiness Index (NRI) 2016a key component of the World Economic Forums The Global Information Technology Report 2016. The report assesses the state of networked readiness of 139 economies using the NRI and examines the role of information and communication technologies (ICT) in driving innovation. It is thus a key tool in assessing a countrys preparedness to reap the benefits of emerging technologies and capitalize on the opportunities presented by the digital transformation.Also read: Budget 2017: Arun Jaitley unveils series of post-demonetisation digital reformsThe 2016 edition of the NRI placed Singapore at the top of the list of countries when it comes to networked readiness. Finland, which topped the ranking in 2014, came second for the second year in a row, followed by Sweden, Norway and the US, which climbed two places. The remaining top 10 comprised the Netherlands, Switzerland, the UK, Luxembourg and Japan. Networked readiness, therefore, is correlated to per-capita income.Not only was India ranked 91 among 138 countries in 2016, but WEFs figures also showed that India had actually fallen 23 places in the NRI ranking in the last four years. In 2013, when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government was in power, India was ranked 68 on the index out of 144 countries. When the Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government took over in May 2014, the ranking slipped to 83 out of 148 countries. In 2015, Indias ranking fell to 89 out of 143 countries. And in 2016, it slipped two places to 91 out of 138 countries.While Indias absolute score has changed only marginally in recent years, other countries are racing ahead at faster speeds. Lack of infrastructure and low levels of skills among the population remain the key bottlenecks to widespread ICT adoption, especially in terms of individual usageissues that governments have attempted to address over the last 10 years.Also read: Union Budget 2017: The winners and losersAs the WEF report pointed out in its 2016 edition, a deep divide persists between well-connected metropolitan hubs and remote rural areas, which lack even the most basic infrastructure. This implies that BharatNets implementation track record needs to significantly improve for the benefits to reach rural India.Second, Indias spirited talk about becoming a cashless economy happened when the Indian government invalidated high-value banknotes on the night of 8 November, taking out 86% of the currency in circulation by value. It was supposed to be a war on unaccounted and untaxed wealth, counterfeit notes and terror financing. Instead, as serpentine queues formed outside bank branches and automated teller machines (ATMs) went dry for days and weeks together, the slogan changed. It became all about promoting a cashless or at least a less-cash culture in an economy where almost 90% of transactions are paid for in cash. Indians can boast about technologies such as mobile wallets, crypto-currencies such as bitcoin, mobile peer-to-peer payments, blockchain technology, payment banks and architecture such as the unified payments interface (UPI) and the recently-launched Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) app.  But the government is yet to devise a police on online security. The Indian IT Act (2008) alone will not suffice.Third, Digital Indias Rs1.3 trillion programmewhich envisages a plethora of e-governance services across sectors like healthcare, education and banking, and promises to introduce transparency in the system, reduce corruption and achieve inclusive growthwas only given the green light in 2015. And while the Modi government was simply building on the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) that was approved in 2006 under the previous government, it is obvious that digital programmes do not bear fruit overnight.Also read: Budget 2017: A minimalist approach for an evolving IndiaSmart cities are a case in point. It takes 30-40 years to build a city. Programs like Smart Cities and Make in India will require considerable investments in terms of manpower, technological upgrades, skill development, digital literacy and, most importantly, a plethora of standards to be laid out and adhered to. The Internet of Things (IoT) which entails hundreds of thousands of sensors will need interoperability of standards and security policies in place so that our smart devices, smart homes, smart grids and smart cities are not paralysed by smart cybercriminals.Fourth, while one can see tangibles like the governments Digital Locker and other e-services ride on a robust GI Cloud, also known as Meghraj, Internet speeds are poor in India despite the spread of fourth generation (4G) technology. Mobile calls still drop routinely in Digital India. Not to mention that many people in villages still do not have an Internet connection or enough local language content.Fifth is the power of online education. In a bid to bridge the digital divide through online education, Jaitley on Wednesday also announced that the governments Swayam platform, which has been developed by the ministry of human resource development and All India Council for Technical Education with the help of Microsoft Corp., will start offering 350 online courses. Swayam would be ultimately capable of hosting 2,000 courses and 80,000 hours of learning, covering school, under-graduate, post-graduate, engineering, law and other professional courses, according to its website.While online courses are definitely the need of the hour, they again will be dependent on high-speed broadband connectivity, a digital mindset, and more importantly, government recognition for online course certificates without which there will be few takers.India is at the cusp of a massive digital transformation, said Jaitley as he listed digital as one of the 10 key themes in Union Budget 2017.

				On Monday night, Cyrus Mistryunceremoniously dumped as group chairman two months agoended his high-decibel bid to hang around at operating companies that had called shareholder meetings to oust him.But Mistrys resignation from those boards is perhaps only a recognition that he was going to lose the proxy fight. Ratan Tata, who engineered the coup against Mistry at holding company Tata Sons Ltd, wont be resting easy. The founding familys tenuous control of the $103 billion conglomerate cant be taken for granted.With Mistry promising to shift the battleground, a far messier skirmish lies ahead. The risk is no longer of a split in the empire; now, just by being patient and uncompromising, Mistry could in theory get all of it.The ousted chairman says he will take the fight to a platform that can uphold the rule of law. Courts, however, are unlikely to get involved in deciding whether Ratan Tata kept meddling in the operating companies after handing over the reins four years ago.Also read: The options before Cyrus MistrySimilarly, Mistrys insinuations of insider trading might baffle the securities regulator. It would be one thing to show that trustees of Tata Trusts, philanthropic institutions that control two-thirds of Tata Sons, asked and got unpublished, price-sensitive information about publicly listed units, but quite another to prove that any of them enriched themselves or others.Alleged financial fraud and violation of foreign-exchange laws at Tata Groups joint-venture airline with Malaysias AirAsia Bhd might pose a more serious challenge, and even ethical lapses that arent necessarily crimes would serve their purpose. If the fog is thick enough to keep the conglomerate on front pages of newspapers for all the wrong reasons, an irritated government might be forced to intervene in Tata Trusts on the grounds that they have gone astray from their charitable mission.Assume Ratan Tata is no longer able to control Tata Trusts. Then, as the second-largest investor in Tata SonsMistrys family owns more than 18%the deposed leader gets to shape the groups destiny.It wont be that easy. If Ratan Tata, whos back as interim chairman of the holding company, can quickly find a strong successor to look after the empire, he can regain his footing. That would allow him to broach a compromise from a position of strength. Theres already a proposal to list Tata Sons. Citigroup Inc. drew up a detailed plan some time back. Implementing it would unlock value for Mistrys shareholding, too.Whether the deal works depends on Mistrys risk preference: The longer he drags on the conflict, the more the loss of wealth for all shareholders, including himself. But Mistry, 48, has one advantage over his 78-year-old-adversary: time.The onus to settle the feud is on Ratan Tata, and the younger man must know that, too.

				According to BNP Paribas, TCS will report a 6% increase in dollar revenue in the current financial year, down from last years 7%. Even this projection looks a tad generous, and, according to Mint calculations, TCS runs the risk of less than 5.6% growth.Put simply, TCS, for the first time since it clocked 5.4% growth in 2009-10, could add less than $1 billion in incremental revenue this year. And that could ring alarm bells at TCS, which ended with $16.5 billion in revenue in the financial year to March last year.TCS will report its fiscal third quarter earnings on Thursday.Accenture Plc., a firm about twice as large as TCS, recorded 6% growth in the year ended August (Accenture follows a September-August financial year). Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solution Corp., which was about half of TCSs size of $6 billion in 2009when Natarajan Chandrasekaran became the CEO of TCSwill still manage 9% growth to end the year with at least $13.5 billion in revenue (Cognizant follows the calendar year as financial year).At the heart of TCSs underperformance, which started manifesting in July 2014, is its inability to build a stronger consulting practice and the managements reluctance to buy small firms for technologies like design consulting and data analytics and automation platform providers. TCS also faces some client-specific challenges, all of which have led to low growth. Still, over the last two years, this has not stopped TCS management from claiming the company is making itself future-ready. The biggest concern for stakeholders is if TCS will continue to chug along in 2017-18 and disappoint with depressing growth numbers. For now, the signals are not bright. With this as the backdrop, Mint puts the spotlight on five things to watch in TCSs third quarter earnings on 12 January:1. Revenue growth and management commentary on the demand outlookBNP Paribas expects TCSs dollar revenue to inch up 0.3% to $4.39 billion in the October-December period on a sequential basis. Most brokerages do not expect any significant uptick in growth in the current quarter, either. Nonetheless, management commentary on demand for companys services from clients, especially in Europe and US, will be crucial.2. Pressure on profitability Since January last year, TCSs operating margins have been under pressure. Its 26.1% Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin at the end of March quarter was 54 basis points less than margins at the end of October-December period of 2014. The companys margins further contracted to 25.1% at the end of June quarter, and improved to 26% at the end of July-September period. Now, as commoditized deals come under further pricing pressure, traditional levers like going slow on hiring will not be enough to offset the gradual decline in profitability. For this reason, most analysts are doubtful if TCS will be able to operate in the managements stated guidance of 26-28%.3. Performance in the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) and retail sectorsAccentures performance in the September-November period and management commentary suggests some weakness in business from clients in the BFSI sector. This spells trouble for a company like TCS, which generates more than 40% of its business from BFSI. Retail segment too has seen a decline, and for this reason, management commentary on BFSI and retail, which together bring about 54% of its total revenue, will be eyed.4. Impact of US bill seeking to increase pay to employees with H1B visasEarlier this month, a legislation demanding that outsourcing firms pay at least $100,000 a year to employees who work in the US was introduced in the Congress. Analysts and industry executive believe it could take up to a year before the US makes this a law. Washingtons demand that companies like TCS pay a minimum wage of $100,000 to employees with H1B visas could hurt profitability by 300-500 basis points, according to a 9 January note by JPMorgan Chase and Co. analyst Viju George. Management commentary on this will be watched.5. Weak sectors and geographiesTCS does not expect growth to rebound in Japan. The company claims to have arrested any loss of business from its UK-based insurance platform Diligenta. Growth from telecoms segment continue to be wobbly. Together, underperformance by the three units eroded about 2% growth from the companys 11.9% growth on constant currency basis in 2015-16.

-0.22,"Mumbai: More than half the BSE-100 companies that have reported September quarter results have beaten earnings estimates, but analysts say a broad-based earnings recovery is still at least two quarters away.
				   
				A Mint analysis of quarterly earnings of 53 members of the BSE-100 index shows that 28 of them have exceeded consensus earnings estimates by Bloomberg. Similarly, 14 out of the 30 Nifty-50 firms that have reported their earnings have beaten expectations.Contrary to what the September quarter earnings show, analysts say there are no visible green shoots of an economic revival and volume growth in sectors such as consumer staples and cement indicate subdued demand. The earnings season has not provided any signs of an incipient economic recovery and management commentary on demand for the next two-three quarters is generally subdued, said a 1 November Kotak Institutional Equities note to clients.  Volume growth will become increasingly relevant as a driver of profits from here on as the scope for reducing costs to improve earnings is largely over, the note added. Sharing a similar view, Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd, in a 2 November note, said the fiscal second-quarter earnings season has been in line with expectations so far on the headline numbers front, but much better on internals (earnings breadth, upgrade/downgrade ratio, surprise vs., miss ratio). Volume growth trends have been mixed.The dismal performance of Indian information technology (IT) companies and banks, especially Axis Bank Ltd, added to the disappointment of investors. There were expectations that bad loan issues could bottom-out in Q2, but that has not happened. In the IT sector too, there is a lot of disruption and large-cap IT stocks could take time to gather the momentum they had earlier, said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities Ltd. The poor volume growth reported by packaged consumer goods companies indicates that rural spending has not yet picked up despite normal monsoon rainfall, he added.Another point of concern is whether companies will be able to sustain their profitability at the levels seen in the quarter ended 30 September. Some analysts say that a surge in global commodity prices will limit further expansion of operating margins even as  the benefits of low input prices from inventory acquired at lower cost is likely to fade away soon. One of the highlights of this result season is that some sectors have shown margin expansion on the back of lower commodity prices which is not sustainable going forward, so margins will not stay at these levels, said Vaibhav Agrawal, head of research at Angel Broking Ltd. But how deeply rising input costs will dent profitability will be known after December quarter earnings, analysts said. Companies may have to resort to price hikes if raw material prices rise substantially.Meanwhile, the wait by investors for the positive impact of a normal monsoon and seventh pay commission payouts to reflect on companies performance has got a bit longer. We will have to wait for one or two more quarters to see signs of rural spending revival and its impact on economic growth, Jasani said.",2016-11-03,Up1k7NidxDziMcC5XxKUxJ,"Broad-based earnings recovery is still at least two quarters away, say analysts",01:42,"Earnings pick up in September quarter, but no turnaround yet"

				In early 2009, NTT Docomo invested Rs14,500 crore ($2.2 billion) in an Indian wireless business on the understanding that if certain targets werent met in five years, its partner, Mumbai-based Tata Group, would either find a buyer for the Japanese companys 26.5% stake at fair market value, or would take over those shares at half the original value of the investment, whichever was higher. When Docomo decided to exercise the option in April 2014, there was no taker for the unprofitable operations, so the Tatas sought central bank permission to pay out the equivalent of Rs7,250 crore.By then, however, the Reserve Bank of India had a new set of rules that banned any exit by a foreign equity investor at an assured price. Still, the central bank, under Governor Raghuram Rajan, wanted to allow the payment because it was a question of an Indian company honouring an agreement, struck at a time when there was no clear law against options embedded in such an investment. Also, this clearly wasnt a case of foreign-currency debt masquerading as equity. How many creditors agree in advance to a 50% haircut after five years? Yet the Indian government, which had the final say, decided the Tatas shouldnt be allowed to pay Docomo.In January 2015, Docomo took the dispute to the London Court for International Arbitration. Last month, the court awarded the Japanese firm $1.17 billion (Rs7,840 crore at the current rate) in compensation from Tata Sons, the Indian conglomerates holding company.The saga should have ended there, except that:Bloomberg News reports that New Delhi intends to block the arbitration payment, too; Japans Nikkei says Docomo might ask a US court to seize Tata assets; The Financial Times has learned from a person close to Docomo that the Japanese company might seek enforcement action on Tata Groups British businesses; and The Tata Group is countering that the struggling Port Talbot steel plant in south Wales, as well as UK-based Jaguar Land Rover, are owned by Tata Steel and Tata Motors  theyre not Tata Sons properties. So the whole thing has become a spectacle. The Indian governments refusal to take a commonsense view of Docomos claim was a poor decision. New Delhi is now making bad judgment worse by threatening to block the arbitration award.Such actions have consequences. Not only has the governments pigheadedness created unnecessary risks for minority shareholders of publicly traded Tata Steel and Tata Motors, it has also cast doubts on Prime Minister Narendra Modis resolve to change investors experience of doing business in India.

				Bengaluru-based Wipro does not give an annual forecast (it provides quarterly guidance) and for this reason, it has clarified that this should not be interpreted as a target.Still, Wipro, which over the last few years has struggled to keep pace with its larger rivals, believes that measures taken since February this year to generate more business from existing clients, investments in building capabilities in new technologies, such as cloud computing platforms and Internet of things, and an aggressive mergers and acquisitions (M&A) strategy should help it get to industry-matching growth.Im always careful of putting a timeline and so I believe it is not unreasonable to expect this industry-matching growth number by March 2018, Neemuchwala said in an interview on Friday.I feel very confident and I see that green shoots (are) coming in a more sustainable manner. Im very hopeful that four-five quarters is a good time for a very visible outcome or metric for an industry-leading growth or margin.Also see | What ails Indian IT?Wipro under Neemuchwala, who joined the company in April last year as chief operating officer and was elevated to his current role as CEO in February, posted a 0.8% decline in dollar revenue growth in the second quarter, mirroring the growth pangs faced by countrys $150 billion outsourcing sector. Wipros large rivals, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd, run the risk of slower growth this year than the 7.1% and 9.1% growth recorded last year. To be sure, some of the early signs of the measures taken have started reflecting well, with the company improving its ability to generate more business from existing clients, and arresting declining profitability.Wipro has managed to improve average revenue per client to about $6.6 million at the end of September from $6 million at the start of the financial year in April.The firm managed to hold on to a 17.8% operating margin, same as during the April-June period, despite giving salary raises to close to 174,000 employees during the July-September period. Wipros margins had narrowed sharply after it reported 19.7% profitability in the March quarter. Wipros muted 0-2% QoQ dollar revenue growth guidance for third quarter is a disappointment and belies hopes for a turnaround in the core business. Despite this, margin management and cash-flow generation continues to be strong. We also like the recent acquisition of Appirio, a US-centric cloud services firm, Pankaj Kapoor, director of India IT services and software equity research at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, wrote in a note after the company declared its earnings on Friday.Significantly, Neemuchwala also said Wipros aggressive M&A strategy will boost its chances of becoming a $15 billion firm by 2020.

0.1,"Mumbai: The board of Tata Sons Ltd on Monday replaced Cyrus P. Mistry as chairman, less than four years after he took the helm, and named his predecessor Ratan Tata interim chairman for four months.
				   
				The board of the group holding company did not specify a reason for the abrupt move, which was announced after markets closed.Tata Sons in its collective wisdom and on the recommendations of the principal shareholders decided that it may be appropriate to consider a change for the long-term interest of Tata Sons and Tata group, a spokesperson said. A selection committee comprising Ratan Tata, Venu Srinivasan, Amit Chandra, Ronen Sen and Kumar Bhattacharyya was given the mandate of finding a replacement for Mistry, 48, who became chairman of the $103 billion conglomerate in December 2012, at the end of Tatas over two-decade tenure at the top. The board was given four months to complete the task. In the interim, the board has requested me to perform the role of chairman and I have agreed to do so in the interest of and reassurance to the Tata group, Ratan Tata, 78, said in a statement addressed to colleagues.ALSO READ | Uneasy lies the Tata crownThe development, which portends at least short-term turmoil, comes at a time when the conglomerate, whose business interests range from tea to telecom and salt to software services, has been trying to recast or dispose of the key UK steel business, which it acquired in a $12.9 billion purchase of Corus Group Plc. in 2007 under Ratan Tata.This is quite an unusual situation, unexpected from a group like Tata which stands for its values. This means there could possibly have been some governance issue or some major disagreement with either the style of functioning or decision that Mistry may have taken, said Kavil Ramachandran, professor and executive director at the Thomas Schmidheiny Centre for Family Enterprise at the Indian School of Business.According to a person aware of the development, the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, of which Mistry is a scion and which is estimated to hold an 18% stake in Tata Sons, is protesting the move, paving the ground for what could be a messy battle. About two-thirds of Tata Sons is held by philanthropic trusts such as the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Mistry will continue as a Tata Sons director, the spokesperson cited earlier said. However, the group executive council (GEC), a brainchild of Mistrys, has been disbanded, said a person aware of the development. The GEC page has been pulled down from Tata Sons website as has Mistrys September interview to the in-house magazine in which he stated his views on some of the underperforming companies in the group. Our individual companies need to earn the right to grow, he said in the interview.The boardroom putsch has been some time in the making, according to a person close to Mistry, who asked not to be identified. Differences have surfaced over how Mistry has been dealing with the significant challenges facing the group.Several of Mistrys operational decisions were challenged by Ratan Tata, according to this person. Still, it is the prerogative of the largest shareholder to do this, the person said a few weeks ago. Mint couldnt ascertain if there was an immediate trigger for this ouster.Primarily, it was a lack of communication between the shareholder and the management. A lot of decision-making was done unilaterally by Tata Sons and was not approved by Tata Trusts, said another person briefed about the matter.Among the six chairmen Tata Sons has had so far in its history, Mistrys is the shortest tenure at just short of four years.ALSO READ | Ratan Tata says intolerance a curse we are seeing of lateSince taking over, Mistry has repeatedly talked about continuing to seize business opportunities, especially in emerging technologies.

				In the past seven years, cash flow from operations amounted to 23.3% of revenues for Infosys, compared to 19.8% in the case of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and 16.2% for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. But, as is well known, Infosys has lagged considerably in terms of shareholder returns during this period. Cash may be king, but it is clearly no emperor. Investors far prefer strong growth accompanied by a reasonable amount of cash generation to exceptional cash generation accompanied by sluggish growth.Is TCS now falling into the same trap? Its growth rate has fallen considerably and cash flow generation has improved in recent years. It has closed the gap with Infosys considerably in terms of cash generated from operations19.3% of revenues in FY16 versus 19.6% for Infosys. Besides, it has curtailed capital expenditure. As a result, it has overtaken Infosys in free cash flow generation in the past two years. The amount spent by TCS on capital expenditure and acquisitions accounted for just 12.5% of cash flow from operations in the past two years, compared to 28.7% in the case of Infosys.Should investors be worried? According to an analyst with a multinational brokerage firm, the company has chosen the organic route to invest for the future, compared to some of its peers who have preferred acquisitions to plug gaps in their portfolio. Analysts at JPMorgan India Pvt. Ltd said in note to clients after attending an 18 March analysts meet, We came away with an enhanced appreciation of TCSs digital capabilities and conclude that its lack of M&A in digital does not necessarily mean lack of capabilityit is strongly building the needed, differentiating digital strengths organically.Another reason cash flow generation has improved in recent years is that the company has reduced its exposure to some emerging markets such as India. Working capital needs are typically higher in these regions, and the lower exposure has meant that overall cash generation has improved. Both of the above points suggest that growth isnt necessarily being sacrificed. Of course, it remains to be seen if TCSs plan to grow organically helps it catch up with peers soon.Thankfully for Infosyss shareholders, its new leadership has made growth a priority. The company even beat TCS on revenue growth in fiscal year 2015-16. M&A (mergers and acquisitions) activity has picked up, indicating that it is getting bolder with its use of cash. And cash flow from operations fell to below 20% of revenues last year, compared to around 24% in the preceding three years.

0.52,"Mumbai: Cyrus Mistry, who was part of the panel tasked to find a successor to Ratan Tata for heading the over $100 billion Tata Group, had himself become a surprise selection only to see his tenure cut short abruptly on Monday within four yearsthe shortest at the conglomerate. 
				   
				The 78-year-old Tata is now part of the selection panel that has been asked to search the next chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, the groups main holding company, within next four months and he would also serve as interim chairman in this period.Also Read: Cyrus Mistry ousted as Tata Sons chairman, Ratan Tata steps inA low-profile man to the extent of being reclusive, Mistry, 48, was a surprise choice to succeed Tata, who retired on 29 December, 2012 as chairman of the one of the countrys oldest business empires. The only second non-Tata to take charge of the group after Nowroji Saklatvala in 1932, Mistry by virtue of his age came in with a lot of promise, specially of continuity when he became chairman of Tata Sonsthe promoter of the major operating Tata companies at the age of 44. However, in nearly four years since he took over the reins of the salt-to-software conglomerate, Mistry had to face many challenges in both domestic and global markets as many of the group companies faced headwinds. He undertook a strategy of divesting assets in contrast to what his successor did. Significant among them is the groups steel business, specially Tata Steel Europe. Earlier this year, the company had completed selling of the European long products business in the UK as well as a mill in France to Greybull Capital. It had also announced plans to sell its UK operations after years of losses, although the company is yet to finalize the sale. In July, Tata groups hospitality firm Indian Hotels Company Ltd (IHCL), which runs Taj Group of hotels, completed sale of Taj Boston hotel for $125 million (about Rs839 crore). The hospitality firm had also sold off 12.7 lakh shares of Belmond (earlier known as Orient Express, which the Tata Group tried unsuccessfully to acquire in Ratan Tatas time) for a consideration of $11.96 million. IHCL had also sold BLUE Sydney, a Taj Hotel, to Australia Hotels & Properties Ltd for AU$ 32 million (nearly Rs179 crore) in 2014. The Tata group is also engaged in a legal battle with Japans Docomo over the split of their telecom joint venture Tata Docomo. Contrary to these developments, Tata led the group into some notable acquisitions, starting from Tetley by Tata Tea for $450 million in 2000 to steelmaker Corus by Tata Steel in 2007 and the landmark Jaguar Land Rover in 2008 for $2.3 billion by Tata Motors. Also read: Uneasy lies the Tata crownWhile the reasons for Mistrys sacking by the Tata Sons board is not clear, according to sources, the decision taken on the suggestion of Tata Trusts. In the long term interest of Tata Sons and the Tata Group, the principal shareholdersTata Trusts suggested to the Board of Tata Sons that it would be appropriate to look for a change and look forward, a source said. When Mistry took over, the Tata Group had a revenue of $100.09 billion in 2011-12. Since then, the groups revenue grew to $103 billion in 2015-16. About 66% of the equity capital of Tata Sons is held by philanthropic trusts endowed by members of the Tata family. The largest of these trusts are the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Sir Ratan Tata Trust, which were created by the families of the sons of Jamsetji Tata, the founder. Mistry belongs to Shapoorji Pallonji, which is the single largest shareholder in Tata Sons with 18.4% stake.

0.28,"The economic reform process which began dramatically over a few days at the end of July 1991 was a massive collective achievement in a country where any change for the better is stymied by the enemy within. And the plethora of books marking 25 years of that start has been enormously educative in taking us through the internal parlays, and in a few cases subterfuge, which together made it all happen. 
				   
				It is a well-worn cliché to say that the 1991 package was incomplete, and intellectually flawed (which it was), but what we now need is to pick up each thread of the impossible skein of controls wrapped around the Indian economy pre-reform, and see how it has fared over the years, and where it lies right now. We need to recognize that a second important reform impetus happened over 1999-2001 which sprung loose some tightly wound threads, and further straightened out those that had been unwrapped in 1991.Then there were reform initiatives which were talked about in 1991 but not actually introduced at the time. One such is the goods and services tax (GST). The tax reforms committee of 1991, chaired by Raja Chelliah, was tasked in its terms of reference only to look at taxes levied by the centre (this was part of the larger problem of neglect of state participation which characterized that first round of reforms). Even so, it said (para 9.3 of the interim report): It would be ideal if there were one comprehensive VAT (value-added tax) replacing the present system of Central excises, the State sales taxes and other indirect taxes except the State levy on alcoholic liquor... The GST was a brainchild of the fiscal reforms of 1991 although the committee didnt call it by that name.   The constitutional amendment to enable GST finally cleared the Rajya Sabha on 3 August, but the amendments to the bill to make that possible mean that it will have to pass through the Lok Sabha again. Then the GST bill to operationalize the tax will have to be passed, probably only in the next session of Parliament. The tortuous path of GST is possibly the only example of a reform initiative which has actually gained from its extended delay (with the exception of recent segments of it). It was sensible to first attempt value-added taxation separately in the indirect taxation sphere at the centre (the first tentative moves of which happened with MODVAT, or modified value-added tax in pre-reform 1986), and in the sphere of states (begun in 2005 in most states), before attempting to merge the two. Much will now depend on the GST network, a special purpose vehicle appointed to smooth out glitches in the information technology channels so that taxpayers can make their GST payments through a single window. The Compensatory Afforestation Bill of 2016, finally passed in the Rajya Sabha on 28 July, a long time after its passage through the Lok Sabha, is somewhat different from GST. Here is a case which completes a reform begun even earlier in 1980, where nothing whatever has been gained from the delay. On the contrary, there has been only profoundly irreversible loss. This will be fully acknowledged even by those opposed to diversion of forested land to commercial uses such as dams, which was made legally permissible by the Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980, subject to prior approval from the Government of India, and subject to payment of a prescribed sum for compensatory afforestation. Given that enactment, and given that land has already been diverted under its provisions, and compensation paid, even those opposed to forest land diversion will surely agree that such compensation should be actually used for afforestation instead of being locked up as unutilized funds. Which, believe it or not, was the situation until the recently moved bill. If those funds had been ploughed in at the time they were collected, we would actually have fully grown forests in place. What we can hope for at best now, after the bill is passed, is maybe saplings in a years time. Time lost. Environment disprotected. Irretrievable loss.A Supreme Court order dated 30 October 2002, in its judgement on a writ petition, mandated that the amounts payable under the 1980 Act should be deposited in a Compensatory Afforestation Fund. A further Supreme Court direction, dated 5 May 2006, required that in the absence of a formally legislated Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) of the kind that will now come into being with the passage of the 2016 bill, an ad hoc CAMPA be created at the Centre to centrally pool the money recovered on behalf of the said Authority lying in the States and Union territories. This suggests that between 2002 and 2006 the sequestered funding lay where it was collected, at state-level, and that between 1980 and 2002 the unsequestered funds were merged with the general budget under the general head of non-tax receipts, and dealt with, productively or otherwise, by states. Subsequent to the 2006 Supreme Court direction, the money was pooled in an ad hoc CAMPA fund at the centre. Not all was hoardedsome was indeed distributed to states, in proportion to jurisdictional collections. A report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG Report No. 21 of 2013), reports that the annual amount released from the central ad hoc CAMPA to states over the three years 2009-12 amounted to nearly Rs.3,000 crore in aggregate. Even so, the amount remaining at the centre for distribution between states, as mentioned in the preamble to the 2016 bill, is Rs.38,000 crore. This is presumably the collection since 2002, since before that nothing was being accumulated. The sum represents the total collected under several heads covering compensatory afforestation and penalties levied on those who did not take prior approval, added to the net present value of the diverted forest land or cultivated catchment area. Thus the loss in not having used this fund towards afforestation earlier is truly enormous. All that can be hoped for now, going forward, is that the monitoring mechanism proposed in the bill will ensure productive use at ground level of the accumulated funds. As for funds payable on further diversion of forest land, the 2016 bill will hand over 90% of compensatory funds received directly to states. However, the CAG report referred to above presents a very discouraging picture of state capacity to use afforestation funds effectively. The overall utilization by states of funds released over 2009-12 was as low as 61%. Even more worryingly, the utilization rates were lowest in states with high forest cover such as Arunachal Pradesh (9%), Chhattisgarh (33%), Himachal Pradesh (59%) and Meghalaya (0%).What reform has failed to do in every sphere is to improve government capacity for expenditure. Monitoring mechanisms to prevent misdirection of government expenditure merely result in obstructing expenditure altogether. Even in the 2016 bill, the steering committee mandated at state level is chaired by the chief secretary. The time and attention of the senior-most civil servant in the state, thought necessary to secure every process from corruption, becomes so thinly stretched as a result that procedural delays become the norm rather than the exception. Government processes remain substantially unreformed. The accumulation of unspent funds for afforestation, and the low level of utilization of even such funds as were disbursed to states for the purpose, is only a small part of the larger problem of unspent funds (float) lying with governments in all departments. A. Santhosh Mathew, a government officer belonging to the Indian Administrative Service, has written widely to demonstrate how this results from the antiquated system of layered file-based certification of fund utilization. He estimates that a third of reported government expenditure lies parked, unused. A workflow based IT platform for each expenditure programme, such that funds can be transferred in real time from the funding source directly to the point of expenditure, can get rid of this problem of unspent funds. To quote him: a synchronized effort to adopt IT systems across government simply means a dramatic reduction in fiscal deficit, more money for lending to the private sector, a more efficient public financial management system, and a more reliable government to conduct business with.The only reservation I have is that where government systems have been shifted onto automated platforms, automation is typically done through a tender process that selects private players working on wafer-thin margins, who run their systems with poorly paid operators, and face high employee turnover. Add to that problems with electricity, and you have systems that have users tearing their hair in frustration. Very often automated systems ask that users use the manual channel in addition, which then renders redundant the very purpose of automation. But automation with a provision for continued correction through interface with users is clearly the direction in which to move. That alone, however, will not get compensatory afforestation moving on the ground.Indira Rajaraman is an economist.",2016-08-05,YLqbMiTRGk2RemWsBYzQMN,"The tortuous path of GST is possibly the only example of a reform initiative which has actually gained from its extended delay (with the exception of recent segments of it)

Chandrasekaran took over as chief executive officer in end-2009, the company extended its lead over rivals, while at the same time improving profit margins and cash flow.
				   
				By picking Chandrasekaran as its executive chairman, Tata Sons Ltd has essentially picked up the top performing executive from among all its group firms. A moot question is if he will have similar success managing the unwieldy conglomerate, with a number of large firms that face a diverse set of challenges. But that would be a challenge for any person, and Chandra looks better placed than other rumoured contenders for the role.ALSO READ | How TCS chief N. Chandrasekaran became Tata Sons chairmanA bigger worry is how TCS manages the transition in leadership. In the past seven years, the company contributed over 90% of Tata Sons total dividend income. TCS is effectively the goose that lays the golden egg for the Tata group. If growth stutters at the company as a result of the leadership transition, the entire group will be affected adversely.Chandrasekaran developed relationships with large clients, oversaw operations and held myriad things together simultaneously. To say that he will be missed is an understatement. Whats more, unlike the time when he himself took over as CEO from S. Ramadorai, there has been no clear succession planning.ALSO READ | Safe choice Chandrasekaran will be tested as Tata Sons chairmanRajesh Gopinathans appointment as the new CEO comes across more as a sudden response to the evolving situation at Tata Sons, rather than a planned move. According to an analyst with a multinational brokerage firm, while Gopinathan is sharp and intelligent, his elevation as CEO is likely to irk more senior colleagues who headed business for large geographies and verticals.What makes things look disconcerting is the current backdrop of demand for IT outsourcing. The shift in customers spending patterns from traditional services to digital services has hurt companies such as TCS.Besides, the election of Donald Trump is likely to increase visa and other costs for outsourcing companies. So while Chandrasekaran took over at a time when things were beginning to turn around for the industry (in end 2009), Gopinathan is taking over when things are looking increasingly precarious.ALSO READ | N.

0.13,"Last week, an Indian company acquired an Indiana firm. Wipro announced that it was acquiring Appirio, a software integration and technology consulting firm based in Indianapolis. Appirio was established a decade ago to provide technology integration services to clients looking to adopt public cloud applications and platforms, and to focus on what many have called the as-a-service mode of delivering software and business processes. All that as-a-service means is that you have the ability to rent and pay for software features as and when you use them, rather than buy the software itself.
				   
				Much is made today over the as-a-service way of acquiring software. According to analyst firms that track spending in the information technology services sector, the sector is seeing a hefty rebound in demand, most of it driven by corporate spending on the adoption of as-a-service technologies. The methods that these analyst firms use are myriad, like feverishly trawling the Internet for public announcements of services deals, and relying on information technology service providers to give them data on deals they have just concluded. In my experience, these data are collated and then extrapolated to the market by a single individual at the firmand are error pronebut nonetheless, can point to macro shifts in buying patterns.As a result, Wipro has been hailed as a visionary for acquiring a company that has firmly established itself as a leading provider of as-a-service delivery. It now has the ability to make serious moves in the market and has added an arrow to its quiver which is different than all its other arrows, which mainly represent offshore services for a cheaper price. Last week, Mint carried an analysis of Wipros acquisition strategy in comparison to its peers and noted how its acquisitions have allowed it to leapfrog some of its peers in terms of revenue accretion.Coming back to the as-a-service economy, this sort of rent versus buy decision moves in waves over time. Not so long ago, before Indias mobile phone revolution, the country was dotted with ISD/STD call booths in every corner in a classic example of as-a-service delivery. You didnt need to own a landline phone when you could simply walk up to a phone booth and in return for a fee, use someone elses phone for the short duration that you needed to actually make a call. Once it became cheap enough to acquire and use a mobile phone to make calls on ones own, these booths all but disappeared from the Indian landscape.So will it be with the as-a-service wave. What analysts forget is that it is largely traditional, old-fashioned and stable technology that is now being delivered as-a-service. Well-established enterprise resource software (software that helps support sales, production operations, logistics, distribution and financial accounting) such as SAP, Oracle and Salesforce are all now increasingly being delivered as-a-service rather than being bought for hefty licensing fees and the systems integration costs that go with such purchases.The as-a-service economy will not work for new types of software that fundamentally alter the workings of a firm. It simply does not make sense to buy software as-a-service in instances where software or technology is used as a strategic or competitive advantage. Firms building or buying such software in the quest for digital disruption will be looking to keep their competition out, not just use an as-a-service model to rent what can just as easily be rented by their competition. These new types of software will carry new-world data analytics and algorithms that drastically change the way a traditional business operatesand as such are likely to be closely guarded corporate secrets.Interestingly, these algorithms are only being partially built by companies themselves. In this age of open-source programming, and the ready availability of free programming libraries with a simple click of the cursor, corporations are increasingly turning to the programming community at large in a phenomenon called crowdsourcing to solve knotty problems with respect to data analytics and the composition of software algorithms in order to shore up their own considerable internal efforts at building these. Publicly available platforms are being increasingly used for the requisitioning and delivery of services. Service requests are being filled on Twitter and listening posts are being used on LinkedIn to generate sales leads. Companies are using these platforms to hand out prizes to star programmers from the programming community at large who solve the knottiest of their problems in software coding or algorithmic logic. These problems can be parsed out to a point where it is just the tough mathematical or logical issue that is passed on to the platform to solve; the entire program or the function it is designed to perform need never be divulged.And it is precisely for this reason that Wipros acquisition of Appirio is appropriate. Appirio owns both TopCoder and its competitor, CloudSpokes, together forming the largest platform for crowdsourcing of such problems. Some estimates place this number at about 800,000 programmers all over the globe; others claim that this number is actually in the millions. Whatever the actual number, this platform allows for the brightest computing minds to compete at solving the computing problems of the future. Little wonder then, that at a social event last weekend, Rishad Premji, chief strategy officer of Wipro, exclaimed TopCoder when I congratulated him on his new buy and asked him what he thought was the most salient reason why I felt this acquisition represented a watershed event.Siddharth Pai is a world-renowned technology consultant who has personally led over $20 billion in complex, first-of-a-kind outsourcing transactions.",2016-11-01,Yj7Z9wLVL7JM2zCj0U6LCO,"In this age of open-source programming, firms are increasingly turning to the programming community at large to solve knotty problems",00:32,The real reason why Wipros deal to buy Appirio is appropriate
0.56,"Investors in Internet start-ups and growth-stage companies have to traverse a strange universe. The closest parallel I can find is the film industry. As a producer (investor), I might have all the right ingredientsa star-studded cast, a fantastic storyline, chart-busting music scores, breathtaking sets and cinematography, and a visionary directorbut whether or not the film does well at the box office is still somewhat of a gamble. You never know whether the reagents are just right to serve up a blockbuster.Except with the Internet start-up, its even worse since there is another twistthe simple fact that there are a bunch of other start-ups with the exact same storyline! This would be akin to several independent production houses producing the same James Bond movie (since they all own the idea or franchise)at the same time and trying to bring it to the market as fast as possible. This means that there are multiple, simultaneous, identical experiments all taking place at the same time, and no one knows who will win.But wait, I hear you say; doesnt the one who is first to the market end up winning since they will have the first-mover advantage? Well, not necessarily. The me too scenario also works. And not just with the Lyfts and Olas who are replicating Uber today. History also shows us this. Yahoo was the first, true large-scale search engine. It was upended by Google, which, apart from having (at the time) a better search algorithm, also quickly added other chemical reagents to the mixfree email, Web hosting, smartphone software, smart glasses and so on. The result? Googles market capitalization, as I write this, is almost 14 times that of Yahoo$517 billion compared to Yahoos $35 billion. I remember burning my fingers by investing in Yahoo prior to the dot-com burst of 2001. The stock first fell like a stoneand then remained at the bottom of the pond for years thereafter, before staging a weak comeback afterwards. Its still around, and is still a great company, but a Google it is not. And as a footnotewhile Yahoo went public in 1996, Google didnt go public until almost eight-and-a-half years later in 2004which in Internet terms is like a day and night of Brahma8.64 billion solar years, to be precise.In the interim, Yahoo, the firm, has had several chief executivesBartz, Morse, Thompson, Levinsohn and Mayer. (That string sounds almost like the name of a white-shoe law firm.) Not so Google, where, though Indias own Sundar Pichai is now CEO, the founding team of Larry Page, Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt agreed to work together for 20 years after the IPO (until 2024). Page handed the reins over to Pichai only last year, but still remains very involved.The same analogy can be drawn with our own earlier generation of labour arbitrage-based start-ups: the technology services firms. Firms like Infosys, Cognizant and Mindtree, while sometimes criticized for the collegiality of their founding teams, have ended up having had the last laugh despite having had to weather financial crises before. All said and done, Infosyslike Cognizant, Tata Consultancy Services and some other large Indian services companies with stable management teamsis now a global champion, and Mindtree is a strong contender in the next rung.Maybe there are lessons to be learnt from this for Indias array of current start-ups, which saw a market arbitrage opportunity to enter the Internet retail space before their larger global counterparts could enter the market, essentially creating the equivalent of Jack Mas Chinese Alibaba. Flipkart and Snapdeals valuations seem to have hit a wall. Much of the publicity associated with this has been focused on the fact that foreign investors, afraid of a global slowdown and unproven business models, have written down their existing investments in the sector and are unwilling to pony up more cash. And the global market leader, Amazon, has entered the Indian market in a big way.The current bearish scenario in international markets will surely change, just as it did post-2001 and then again post-2008, so the trick is just to hold on and fend off Amazons advance until the financial tide turns. Despite recent changes in the law, Amazon is after all not an Indian firm and will face more hurdles than the home-grown rivals. But, meanwhile, instead of signing long-term agreements to work together and weather what is just a simple financial stormso that they can later go public and monetize their holdingsmany senior executives at these firms seem to be using the revolving door.Just like in the movies, you can only have one or two heroes/heroines in the cast. And the same is true of the villains. Similarly each start-up can only have one or two sultans or sultanas, but constancy in the top teams is vital. Google has its Page, Facebook its Zuckerberg, Alibaba its Ma, and Snapdeal and Flipkart have their Bahl and Bansals. But the sultans need to think of Henry Fords maxim when it comes to business: Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success. A series of cameo appearances does not a blockbuster make.Siddharth Pai is a world-renowned technology consultant who has personally led over $20 billion in complex, first-of-a-kind outsourcing transactions.",2016-04-20,ZQFsl3WTYrbJ5oGFrfBQFM,"Each start-up can only have one or two sultans or sultanas, but constancy in the top teams is vital

He said giving the example of Indian Hotels only because independent directors, one of whom is also a director of Tata Trust, demonstrated true independence, is not in keeping with Tata governance standards, the person said.A look at the board composition of the top six listed Tata group firms where Mistry is chairman shows at least half the board was appointed before 2012, when he took charge. The Tata statement, which runs into nine pages, also cited falling dividend income and increasing impairment provisions, ballooning debt and low return on investments as reasons for removing him as chairman of the $103 billion group.Tata Sons also alleged that under Mistry, the edifice of the group founded in 1868 had been consciously dismantled, resulting in operating companies drifting away from the promoter company and their shareholders.With the exception of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), dividends received from all 40 other firms (many non-dividend paying) in its portfolio have continuously declined from Rs1,000 crore in 2012-13 to Rs780 crore in 2015-16 but the latter figure includes additional interim dividend of Rs100 crores which would have been normally received in 2016-17 (due to budgetary changes), the statement said. It added that in the past four years, the groups debt had increased by Rs69,877 crore to over Rs2.25 trillion.Despite huge investments by firms, the returns are not visible in increased profits, though, in all fairness, some major growth projects like the new steel plant at Kalinganagar will show results only in coming years, the statement said.The person close to Mistry said the Tata Sons statement had selective data, unsubstantiated claims and half truths, without a word of explanation as to why it became necessary to remove him summarily, violating natural justice and without explanation.This person pointed to the high operating profit margin of 14% for Tata Steel Europe in 2014 and the narrowing losses in the Mundra power project (admittedly because of lower coal prices) as examples of improvement under Mistry. This was the largest turnaround in Indian corporate history involving multiple companies and is still a work in progress, said this person.Proxy advisory firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS) said the Tata statement is inconsistent.You cant blame him (Mistry) for non-performance of one company and not give any credit for the good show of the other, said Amit Tandon, IiAS founder and managing director. Mistrys aide cited earlier said the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of Tata Sons lauded his performance on 28 June and its report was adopted by the entire board. Tata Sons is yet to state what necessitated the replacement of Mr. Mistry on October 24 without any notice or an opportunity to defend himself, this person said. Tandon said the Tata Sons statement would have been far more effective and taken a lot more seriously had it come on the day Mistry was removed. Its a bit late in the day.",2016-11-10,aP0lU51O5emJzfxr63fgEL,This is the first time since removing Cyrus Mistry on 24 October that Tata Sons has elaborated on the ostensible reasons for his ouster ,14:13,"Tata Sons escalates war with Cyrus Mistry, says trust betrayed"

				There could be implications for Indian companiesmainly those in the IT and pharma sectorsif either of them wins the election, as these sectors derive a sizeable revenue from the US.If Clinton wins, Indian pharma companies will be adversely impacted as her focus is on reducing medicine costs and, prices may come down to that extent, said Nilesh Shah, managing director of Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co.Echoing Shahs sentiments, Rohit Gadia, chief executive officer of investment advisor CapitalVia Global Research, said a win for Clinton may lead to drugs price regulation in the US, affecting Indian drug makers.A Trump win, on the other hand, may weigh on the information technology and interest rate-sensitive sectors in India, Gadia said.IT will definitely be impacted because a part of the outsourcing business comes from the US. A Trump presidency is negative for this sector because he is in the camp which is likely to tighten rules related to outsourcing.A Trump win may lead to higher fiscal spending, and that may push up interest rates in the US, said Shah of Kotak. That will adversely impact US rate sensitive sectors and in turn have a cascading impact on rate sensitive sectors here, he added.However, it all depends on actions by the new president, post the election, Shah said, adding that markets have largely discounted a Clinton win, and if Trump came to power, the world markets would react adversely.With hours to go before Americans vote, Democrat presidential nominee Clinton has about a 90% chance of defeating Republican Trump in the race for the White House, according to the final Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project, a Reuters report said.All eyes are also on the dollar, and any sharp moves will weigh on emerging market assets.It all depends on how the currency plays out. If dollar starts losing its steam, then the equation will be different for the US. FIIs (foreign institutional investors) will start pulling out from US markets, and emerging markets stand to gain to that extent, said Deven Choksey, group managing director of KRChoksey Investment Managers Pvt. Ltd.The dollar index, which tracks the US currencys movement against six major counterparts, has declined in eight of the nine previous sessions, but eroded only 1.1% in the period, thanks to a 0.7% recovery on Monday.FIIs have been net sellers of Indian shares in 14 of 17 sessions to Monday, and have offloaded more than $1 billion of shares in the period. Indias 30-share benchmark Sensex, which gained a mere 0.2% in October, has already shed 1.2% so far in November.A Trump victory would probably usher in a period of uncertainty for the markets and lead to an initial risk-off mood in markets. If elected, the business magnate and television producer may seek to implement a program that represents a rupture from the past and creates additional uncertainty with regard to trade, budget and monetary policies, NN Investment Partners B.V. said in a report on Monday, on the world markets.Emerging markets may be hit especially hard as investors fear protectionist measures that would seriously impact US imports from emerging economies, NN Investment Partners said.A win by Clinton, who is likely to pursue the policies of her predecessor, would probably be welcomed by markets, at least in the short term, and could result in a relief rally followed by an investor re-focus on fundamentals, NN Investment Partners said, adding that a Clinton presidency could also be good news for emerging markets. Some do not expect big moves for the Indian market, immediately after election results are announced.Nothing will change for the Indian markets immediately after the election results.

0.61,"With China making rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI)-based research, it is imperative that India view AI as a critical element of its national security strategy, recommends an August 2016 report titled India and the Artificial Intelligence Revolution. Authored by Shashi Shekhar Vempati of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the report advocates spurring AI-based innovation and establishing AI-ready infrastructure as prerequisites for preparing Indias jobs and skills markets for an AI-based future and securing its strategic interests. 
				   
				Here are highlights from the report:AIs potential in IndiaThanks to the increasingly digital economy, fuelled by improving education and globalization, the Indian consumer is unknowingly the countrys biggest beneficiary of recent advances in AI, notes the report. From utilizing various applications powered by AI to using a range of online services such as Amazon Marketplace and Netflix that learn from consumers online behaviour to make intelligent product and service recommendations, consumers are readily engaged with the proliferation of AI in India, whether they appreciate it or not. Policymakers, however, lag behind, not exploiting AI for national security, public services, or other priorities.Indian academics, public researchers, labs, and entrepreneurs face a different challenge than the corporations that dominate the spacethe infrastructure necessary for an AI revolution in India has been neglected by policymakers.Why China is stealing a march in AI researchWhile lack of physical infrastructure is certainly a major impediment, Indias AI development also suffers from the paucity of the necessary cultural infrastructure, which is key for recent advances from lab to marketplace in AI. Fostering a culture of innovation and a commitment to research and, most important, nurturing an ecosystem beyond the four walls of the organization are all common to Googles DeepMind, IBMs Watson, and Baidus Institute of Deep Learning, the most successful AI projects of the past half decade.While it must come as no surprise that Google, IBM, Microsoft, Facebook, and other global technology giants have invested significantly over the decades in machine intelligence, it is the story of Baidu that holds the most pertinent lessons for India.The story of AI at Baidu is the story of Andrew Ngan associate professor at Stanford University who teaches a popular course on machine learning (also available via Coursera, an online learning platform that he co-founded). Ng was hired away from the Google Brain project in 2014, following which Baidu invested heavily in physical infrastructure. Baidu is investing in deep speech for voice-based searches that leverage speech recognition. This intelligence is being built for understanding and interpreting queries in Mandarin rather than English; as such, Baidu is constructing a uniquely Chinese platform, independent of that which is used ubiquitously in the English-speaking West.This version of AI thus offers the possibility for the development of AI in India, as an example of AI technology successfully developed in and employed by a non-Western nation. Baidus investment in AI research exposes the relative backwardness of Indias technological infrastructure: China has recognized the importance of bridging the gap between the lab and the market while nurturing a research and innovation ecosystem unbounded by national borders and corporate firewalls. India, in contrast, boasts neither the material nor the cultural institutions required for such innovation.Prime Minister Narendra Modi often challenges Indian IT entrepreneurs, asking when India will give birth to the next Google or Microsoft. But until India attains the infrastructure omnipresent in the US, and increasingly existent in China, the deep-learning capabilities necessary to address the vast linguistic diversity across India using machine intelligence may prove elusive.AIs impact on Indian jobsWhile India dreams of its own manufacturing revolution through Modis Make in India programme, it is important for policymakers to closely examine how the advent of industrial robots and their impact on manufacturing transformed companies in other developing nations.Consider the case of Foxconnone of the worlds largest contract manufacturers for electronics. In 2015, Foxconn made news when its chief executive, Terry Gou, predicted that 70% of all manufacturing in Foxconns assembly lines would be automated with robots displacing humans. Some back-pedalling later, his estimate was scaled down to 30%. Foxconn is among the top owners of robotics patents filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and produces thousands of industrial robots a year that in aggregate are capable of performing more than ten types of manufacturing tasks. This is expected to have a significant impact on the workforce: as many as 60,000 workers have been displaced by robots in one Foxconn factory alone in the Kunshan region of China.China was projected to have more installed industrial robots by the end of 2016 than any other country, with more than 30 robots for every 10,000 industrial workers. If China were to increase that density, employment would be further damaged.While the dire predictions of a robot takeover of manufacturing have not come to pass, the reality of automation is that manufacturing is unlikely to create jobs at the scale that it did in the past. Quoting the US Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2013 on future employment projections, Darrell M. West of the Center for Technology Innovation at Brookings highlights how jobs will decline over the next decade in manufacturing and information technology among other sectors.Writing in Pacific Standard magazine, Frank Levy, professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, places jobs dislocation on account of AI in perspective when he dismisses the dire projections of a robot takeover. According to Levy, the greatest area of concern for policymakers ought to be the impact of AI on jobs in the middle-skill categoryassembly line workers, clerical workers, and the like. Levy also warns of significant dislocation caused by automation leading to a reduction in an individuals potential for upward mobility. He emphasizes that a good education will be critical to acquire the necessary skills and to be competitive in this evolved labour market.In their book The Second Machine Age, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee make several specific policy recommendations for coping with the job crisis likely to be spurred by AI. A key recommendation of particular importance for India, given Modis Startup India initiative, is the need to restart startups. Brynjolfsson and McAfee view creative destruction inherent within the start-up economy as the best bet for experimenting with the new jobs and industries that can thrive in an AI-driven economy. The authors provide examples of start-ups such as TaskRabbit and Airbnb that contrive previously non-existent economic opportunities for ordinary people with spare time and assets, thus creating economically productive work.Skill development for future jobsNot everyone is as sanguine as Brynjolfsson and McAfee about the coming AI revolution. The recent victory of AlphaGo (a computer program developed by Google DeepMind) over the world champion in Go has prompted fears of the threat posed by intelligent machines that are capable of superhuman tasks. The direst warning comes from noted physicist Stephen Hawking, who apocalyptically predicts the end of the human race with the development of full artificial intelligence.In the provocative book Humans Need Not Apply, Jerry Kaplan, an American computer scientist and futurist, explores this and several other questions while attempting to paint a picture of an apocalyptic future and what it might look like if and when machines take over. Specifically, Kaplan raises two issues that should be of interest to policymakers in India. The first is the education system and the second involves skills and jobs. While discussing the likely impact of AI on labour markets, Kaplan poses the radical question: Is the current system of sequential education and work outdated, and does it require an overhaul?In his book, Kaplan also proposes a so-called job mortgage as a new type of financial instrument through which employers, vocational schools and colleges would have an incentive to collaborate in a new way. In this proposed job mortgage market, Kaplan attempts to use free market mechanisms to match current skills acquisition to future job opportunities. He proposes to accomplish this by compelling employers to commit to an intent to employ an individual in the future if that person commits to acquire a specific set of skills over a certain time frame. India will have to experiment with the kind of innovative instruments that Kaplan proposes if it is to prepare itself for the challenges from a machine intelligence-driven economy in the near future.",2017-01-23,bEcUIEcRE25IIfxv8OiXtO,"With China making rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI)-based research, it is imperative that India view AI as a critical element of its national security strategy",05:19,Why India needs an AI policy
0.39,"Steve Hasker, global president and chief operating officer at Nielsen Holding plc, was in India to meet clients and speak on the growing importance of mobile in advertising at the Mobile Marketing Association conference in Gurgaon. 
				   
				During the trip, he met executives from PepsiCo, Nestle, Reckitt Benckiser, Tata group, BARC India and Facebook, among others.India is a very important market for us. The visit was to ensure our success continues and we stay connected with clients, Hasker said as he explained the importance of Nielsens newly launched Total Audience Measurement tool in the US. Edited excerpts:What does Total Audience Measurement include?Total Audience Measurement, thats been launched in the US, has the ability to measure any piece of video, audio or text, on any device at any time and to do it seamlessly and consistently. It has an advertising measurement component and a content measurement component and the ability to put them together. It obviously has a TV, PC, connected device and tablet, and smartphone component and in the US, we have rolled out all those pieces.Here in India, we have started with the digital ad ratings. So, we started with the advertising component. In the coming months, we look to launch the content ratings. But Total Audience Measurement is more than just digital?What Total Audience Measurement does is, it takes all the digital touch points and combines with TV advertising. So, for any campaign, an agency will say, okay, I should think about TV relative to these digital touch points. Should I buy more TV or less TV? This is very important because different markets have different objectives in terms of reach and frequency. Right now, Total Audience Measurement is available in the US; but we have also launched in Mexico and a version of it in Brazil.When will you introduce it in India?To a large extent, that is dependent on BARC (Broadcast Audience Research Council). They have the TV data. In theory, we could do it today because BARC data and digital ad ratings are consistent; but it requires an advertiser to put those two together.Is linear TV declining?What we have seen in a number of countries is the pressure on TV ratings. The size and frequency of audiences watching television has come under pressure in some of the more developed markets like the US, UK and Australia. And that has meant growth in terms of time spent on digital devices. However, what marketers are trying and have now started to understand is that TV has a reasonably unique value proposition in terms of the ability to tell a story to consumers in a way that is accepted by them. And that many large brand campaigns need a TV component. So, the ability to come out of TV altogether and going to digital was overstated. Particularly in 2016 in many markets, we have seen a reversion back to TV and more reliance on TV from an advertising perspective. But the UK and US numbers suggest digital ad revenue has surpassed TV numbers.In the UK, digital surpassed TV a number of years ago; and in the US, it has surpassed in the past 18 months. Those numbers are for real. But this year, in what we call the upfronts which is the mechanism of buying and selling advertising on TV in US, we have seen some reversion back to TV. What a number of major advertisers found that they probably swung the pendulum too far toward digital; and in doing so, they saw some decrease in reach of their campaigns to their target audience. Was losing Indias TV market to BARC a big setback for Nielsen?We certainly enjoyed being part of the TAM joint venture (between Nielsen and Kantar Media owned by WPP Plc) for quite a long period of time. We are very supportive of BARC. We met BARC and have a good relationship. Wed like to help them if we can. So we are looking forward. We think therell be an opportunity to do that. Which are the successful digital models globally? What we have seen in the last couple of years in the US and many countries is the emergence of truly spectacular digital models. One of course is Google with its search model thats been extended to YouTube. And the second is Facebook. In fact, Google, Facebook and, increasingly, Snapchat are proving to be very successful digital models partly because they have attracted disproportionate amounts of consumer time and attention and partly because they have an economic model which is very efficient. Facebook announced last week it had 4 million advertisers. And one of the great things about Facebook and Google platforms is that for an advertiser, they are extremely easy to use. You can target a particular audience and you can buy using your credit card So for advertisers and agencies, it is a great model. It is also a highly profitable model.What about newspaper publishers?It is more difficult for traditional publishersnewspapers or magazines or what we call pure play digital content websites and portals because the audiences access their content through Google, Facebook and Snapchat. In other words, the means in which they get content is through one of these larger players and, secondly, the time and attention is smaller on their properties.So, whats their future?In an increasingly fragmented and complicated world, great journalism, great video production, great TV production is not easier to do. So, even though we have got this great democratization of information and it is freely available in many different places, the ability to interpret news and write insightful commentary around the news, does not become easier in that environment. So, the value attached to that goes up not down.Whats happened here is that theres been a significant disruption in the distribution mechanism; so, whether it is a newspaper or a TV channel , or magazine, consumers now have many different ways to get to that content but, ultimately, the content itself has to be incredibly valuable. And now, done properly, there are more ways to monetize great journalism than there were previously. Right now, what media formats is venture capital (VC) chasing?VCs are very good at sniffing out areas of growth. So they are focused on a couple of thingsone is video. That is, players who are in the digital video space, either producing or distributing video content. Secondly, they are focused on players who have interesting data setson consumer identity or consumer behaviourpurchase behaviour or media consumption behaviour. The other place VCs are more focused on is fintechlike mobile payments and also on healthcare related apps and start-ups.Nielsen acquired Indicus Analytics in India. Are you eyeing more firms here?We would like to make more, provided they enhance our business and make sense financially. For us, India is a very important market. What is the next big thing for Nielsen?The big area of focus for us will be the connected system. We have two businesses. One measures media behaviour, the other measures consumption of consumer packaged goods and provides all kinds of analytics around that. In the media business, the big investment is Total Audience Measurement, and, as we said, we have rolled that out in many countries and we are in the process of bringing that to India. The second area is to build the connected system which links the market share data to explanatory analytics. Say, for instance, did the market share of Kinley water go up because of better product innovation like a new bottle size, different packaging or concept, or did it go up because its marketing has been more effectivetheres been more money on digital and more money on TV. Or did it go up because of in-store execution, its pricing, promotion and assortment was better. So, the connected system will, in real time, enable the brand manager of a particular brand to understand how am I doingwhat happened, why did it happen and what should I do next.So, were in the process of prototyping this with a number of clients across the world and we would look to introduce this here in India sometime next year. We are piloting it with six clients at the moment in different parts of the world. This is our biggest area of investment for the next five years.",2016-10-17,bNj32jkOPJkyiWyZYj8wxO,"India is a very important market for Nielsen, says global president and chief operating officer Steve Hasker",01:41,Some digital advertising is moving back to TV: Nielsens Steve Hasker
0.81,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. reported revenues of $3.19 billion for the September quarter, marginally higher than the Streets estimate of $3.16 billion. On a sequential basis, revenues grew by 3.3%, which again doesnt look impressive for the traditionally strong September quarter. After the June quarters impressive 6% sequential growth, investors are evidently feeling let down.
				   
				But these quibbles aside, Cognizants results reiterate the fact that the company has been miles ahead of the competition this year. On a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, its revenues grew by 16.5%, after adjusting for incremental revenues from the TriZetto Corp. acquisition. In comparison, industry leader Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) grew revenues by just 5.8% y-o-y. Infosys Ltd grew revenues by 7.6% and Wipro Ltds growth stood at just 3.4%.Just a year ago, TCSs growth was higher by about 300 basis points, when it was growing at a healthy pace of almost 15%. But while its growth has slipped sharply in the past four quarters, Cognizant has done just the opposite. The latters growth rate is now almost 11 percentage points higher, an unusually high differential in an industry that is so competitive. One basis point is 0.01%.Also note that Cognizant has raised its revenue growth guidance for 2015 each quarter, for the past three quarters, while analysts have been cutting growth estimates for most Indian tech leaders. Cognizant has benefited from not having any material exposure to troubled sectors such as energy and telecom. But thats not the only reason for its outperformance. There has also been a shift in the nature of IT spending in the past year, and Cognizant, with its higher exposure to discretionary services such as consulting (58% of revenues last quarter), has gained. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a recent note to clients, Companies with inherent strength in run-the-business services are struggling to sustain momentum, while those with greater exposure to discretionary spending are gaining. Last quarter, the so-called run-the-business part of Cognizants portfolio grew by 1.5% sequentially, while growth in segments that depend on discretionary spending stood three times higher at 4.6%.As pointed out earlier in this column, Cognizant appears to have made disproportionate gains in the trend towards increasing spend on digital services. According to analysts, the companys early investments in this segment, including acquisitions it has made in the space, coupled with its consulting expertise, has helped it gain a higher share of this relatively new revenue stream.Its not that others havent had any success. TCS said after its September quarter results that revenues from digital services grew by 10% sequentially last quarter. Be that as it may, overall revenue growth numbers suggest that Cognizant has gained considerable market share this year, at the expense of large India-based IT companies. Last quarter, its incremental revenues of $426 million (on a y-o-y basis) were nearly double that of TCSs ($227 million), and higher than the cumulative incremental revenues of TCS and Infosys.This clear divergence is also reflected in the way these stocks have moved in the past yearCognizants shares have risen by over 35%, while those of TCS have fallen by 3%.",2015-11-04,beBSWzL5LdrIGeZM5tmu3H,"Cognizants results reiterate the fact that the company has been miles ahead of competition this year

Wadia said he had warned of possible future losses from the merged entity. He and other board members had also expressed serious apprehensions on the proposal for the Rs800 crore acquisition of the Brunner Mond Group in the UK, Kenya and Netherlands, he wrote.Wadia, who is chairman of Bombay Dyeing and Manufacturing Co. Ltd, alleged in his earlier representation to shareholders that ahead of Tata Chemicalss 10 November board meeting, its managing director R. Mukundan held a meeting of senior management and asked them to sign a pre-drafted letter seeking to endorse the stand of Tata Sons Ltd. In this representation, Wadia had said that at the board meeting, which followed the meeting of independent directors on 10 November, Mukundan conveyed that in the event the independent directors chose to issue any statement which made a reference to Tata Sonss ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry, he would not permit the company secretary to issue the proposed communication. This, he had said, was a serious cause for concern on the lack of corporate governance in the conduct of the affairs of the company resulting from the undue interference by the dominant promoter.Wadia claimed that the cross-holdings of Tata Chemicals in other Tata companies are being maintained to indirectly keep the voting rights and control in Tata Sons. These large cross-holdings are in various Tata companies, including unlisted ones. If these holdings were to be disposed of, your company would be debt-free, Wadia wrote.Wadia has also served as an independent director on boards of Tata Steel and Tata Motors for 37 and 18 years, respectively.

0.54,"At a time when companies are switching their business models to digital, cybersecurity has become a boardroom concern, for its implications now directly affect the balance sheet. However, its becoming increasingly difficult to objectively quantify a companys cyber risk considering the dynamic nature of an organizations perimeter, which in most cases cannot be distinctively defined thanks to BYOD (bring your own device), BYOA (bring your own access) and Dynamic DNS set-ups among others. The other component hindering quantification is the known unknown attack vectors. 
				   
				Reports estimate that the overall cost of cybercrime will touch $2 trillion (around Rs135 trillion) by 2019. Very recently in India, we saw 3.2 million debit cards being hacked; we have seen the largest bank in the worldJP Morgan Chasebeing hacked even though it spends $300 million on cybersecurity annually. We have seen companies headquartered in the Silicon Valley, built by the best tech minds from around the world, being hackedamong them Yahoo and Twitter. These examples clearly indicate that there is no such thing called 100% security. As in the physical world, the digital world also cannot be secured completely; it will be all about managing and mitigating risks.Cyberspace is continuously changing and evolving. In the future, companies will have to look at a three-dimensional approach of proactively protecting their digital stacks via technology and process-level controls, continuously monitor incidents and events and respond in the quickest and most efficient way possible in case there is an incident. Clear heat maps of data sets versus threat actors such as insiders, competitors, hacktivists, state-sponsored hackers, terrorists, script kiddies and organized criminals will be mapped specific to the industry and the company to prioritize security efforts. At the government level, recognizing the strategic dimensions of cyberspace, the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) created the position of  national cyber security coordinator in 2014, which is a great move. I feel Reserve Bank of India initiatives such as ReBIT (Reserve Bank Information Technology Pvt. Ltd) will enable the much required streamlining of financial services, IT and information security from a regulatory compliance standpoint. The recent push to have an independent payments regulator highlighted in the recent budget by the finance minister is another positive step in this direction.The future of hacking from a techies lens looks very, very exciting. We have already seen an explosion of on-demand hacking services like Haas (hacking as a service), and this will only expand in the future. From script kiddies to a bustling underground marketplace of tailor-made targeted DIY (do-it-yourself) exploits that have 24x7 support, along with the release of continuously enhanced and more sophisticated versions of a malwareits all now just a few clicks and a few hundred dollars away. With other hack enablers such as bot nets readily available to be purchased by the hour, the possibilities of a normal tech enthusiast executing a successful hack go up exponentially.With faster and cheaper computing power readily available, we will see the rise of more complex crypto algorithms with longer key values. This isnt all good news, for complex crypto is always a double-edged swordon the one hand, it does make it hard for a hacker to decipher the data both in motion and at rest; on the other, it becomes extremely difficult to decrypt system files affected by ransomware or doxware.We have been hearing about the shift from a signature-based analysis system to a behaviour and context-based system for quite some time now, but thanks to machine learning and artificial intelligence, I feel we will be able to take tangible steps towards this very soon. AI (artificial intelligence) and ML (machine learning) will also play an extremely important role in real-time learning about individuals from available data over the Internet to create a mind map (which will get more accurate as the data set increases) of an individual you might meet for the first timetaking the entire privacy debate to an absolutely new level. Not to forget the possible implication of an artificial intelligence attack on the Internetsomething thats only a matter of time, in the words of SpaceXs Elon Musk.There will be a clear shift to objective and quantized cyber risk management techniques that will incorporate the known unknowns to make cyber risk an informed business decision. The attack surface will not be restricted to internal IT but will extend to third parties, cloud providers and social media, among others. The focus in the future will not only be on security products but on building secure products from the ground up.The way we are adopting digital, with a clear push coming from the top in both private and public set-ups, technology is going to take centre stage in the success of most new initiatives. And while this happens, the key for the industry will be to learn from cyber attacks and embed the learnings into our defence systems as quickly as possible.

				The scrip had already declined by about 20% from the time the bitter feud between Ratan Tata and Cyrus Mistry started. But investors hope that its UK-subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover Ltds (JLRs) robust numbers would offset the effect of the boardroom brawls has been belied.Barring consolidated net revenue of Rs66,999.7 crore that came close to the average of analysts estimates compiled by Bloomberg, the results disappointed on all other fronts. Consolidated net profit at Rs848 crore, although better than the Rs1,740 crore loss of the year-ago period, was about one-third the forecast. The company attributed this to a huge realized hedging loss and a commodity derivatives impact. A ripple effect of Brexit perhaps.Whats hard to fathom is that JLRs operating margin at 12.9% was nearly 70 basis-points below Bloombergs average. And this is excluding currency hedging losses and the unfavourable revaluation of current assets and liabilities. While details of these one-time items were not available at the time of going to press, they are large enough to hurt investor sentiment. A basis point is 0.01%.Meanwhile, the companys Indian business is facing greater distress. Stand-alone operating margin failed to mirror improvement in commercial vehicle performance. It fell to 2.7% against a forecast of around 6%, and the year-ago margin of 6.8%. In fact, the quarters robust jump in sales volume had raised hopes for a sharper earnings turnaround. This hints at weaker realizations on sales, perhaps reflecting discounts given to push sales. Net loss at Rs630 crore was higher than the median forecast of a Rs20 crore loss.Incidentally, it is the domestic entitys performance that has become a bone of contention in the Tata-Mistry fight. A media release last week said Tata Motors market share in commercial vehicles dropped from 60% in fiscal year 2013 to 40% in FY16hard to accept for a firm that has been the market leader for decades. Also, the drop comes in the last couple of years when the truck segment was northbound and when its arch-rival and competitor Ashok Leyland Ltds share has inched up. Thats not all. Tata Motors passenger car share of the overall market also plunged from 13% to 5%. That said, all investor hopes were pegged on JLR. But this too disappointed. The only silver lining among the host of negatives at this juncture is the stocks reasonable valuation. At Rs510, it trades at about 10 times the estimated earnings for FY18, which is reasonable given JLRs growth prospects. So, any management assurance that the September quarters exceptionally high losses are a one-off and strong sales numbers from JLR may see the stock recover.",2016-11-15,dJKoZ5qKObg92TdK1e8l0L,"Tata Motors Q2 profit stood at Rs848 crore, better than Rs1,740 crore loss in the year-ago period, was about one-third the forecast",07:47,"Tata Motors results: JLR belies investors hope, even as Tata-Mistry battle rages"

-0.2,"Way back in 1976, management guru Peter Drucker wrote: Whenever an institution malfunctions as consistently as boards of directors have in nearly every major fiasco of the last forty or fifty years, it is futile to blame men. It is the institution that malfunctions. Four decades later, the Tata Sons corporate governance disaster reminds us once again that after all the regulatory reforms, after all the talk about the separation of ownership and control, company boards have still to grow a backbone.
				   
				This time, the disappointment is all the more because the reputation of the Tatas is at stake. The Tatas are an icon of Indian business, supposed to represent its best practices. They have been pioneers of modern industry in the country, their leaders have been larger than life and they have acquired so high a standing in the minds of the public that even laffaire Radia did little to take the sheen off their holier-than-thou image. So, this fiasco isnt just about the Tatas. If this is what happens in the hallowed Tata Sons boardroom, what skeletons wait to be unearthed from less genteel, more grubby, Indian company boards?Corporate governance is, at bottom, the way power is exercised over an organization. What signals does the Tata boardroom brawl send out? The unambiguous message is that whoever controls the dominant shareholding calls the shots. In this case, the Tata Trusts are the dominant shareholder and Ratan Tata, as chairman of the Tata Trusts, has full control. Whatever power Cyrus Mistry wielded in the past four years was on sufferance. That conclusion is buttressed by Mistrys letter, which cites an example: once, the trust directors (Nitin Nohria and Vijay Singh) had to leave a Tata Sons board meeting in progress for almost an hour, keeping the rest of the Board waiting, in order to obtain instructions from Mr Tata. That example and the manner of his sacking lend credence to Mistrys claim of alternative power centres without any accountability or formal responsibility. In short, Mistry is saying here that after stepping down as chairman, Ratan Tata became the eminence grise of the Tata empire.ALSO READ | Why Ratan Tatas choice in Cyrus Mistry was a little too convenientThis is not the first time an ageing patriarch refuses to go gentle into that good night, nor will it be the last. As long as the dominant shareholders back him, theres little to be done about it. Power in a company depends upon the block of shares you control. That is capitalism. Notions of shareholder democracy are fatuous. At best, company boards can aim for democratic centralism, the organizational holy grail of Leninist political parties. Small shareholders can opt to vote with their feet, as they have done in the past few days.The other message is that corporate governance norms merely serve as a fig leaf to hide the brute reality of the exercise of power within a corporation and, through it, in society. It is all too easy to go through the motions, tick all the corporate governance boxes on paper and even win prizes for it, as the Satyam fraud so cynically demonstrated.

India, on the contrary, is full of family-controlled companies with dominant shareholdings.

0.62,"Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus of Tata Sons Ltd, served as chairman of the Tata group from 1991 till 2012. He continues to head the groups charitable trusts. The groups philanthropic initiatives are wide ranging and have evolved with the changing economic conditions of the country. Starting with building institutions of repute to hospitals, to research facilities for the socioeconomic integration of the marginalized communities, the groups social engagement has been moulded and influenced by the family values of the Tatas. He talks about why poverty alleviation is key to his philanthropy, how his grandmother influenced him about how to stimulate the wealthy to give more, why access to natural resources is important to improve lives and the India Philanthropy Initiative. Edited excerpts from an interview conducted by Bridgespan in partnership with Mint:
				   
				How did you start your philanthropic journey?I grew up in a family that was driven by philanthropy. My grandmother with whom we spent a great deal of timeshe brought us up because my parents were separatedinfluenced me. We were steeped into philanthropy, whether it would be for the household staff or the person on the street. She was in fact for a period of time, the chairperson of the Sir Ratan Tata Trust. We grew up in that aura of giving back to the people or alleviating misery if we could. Formally I became involved with philanthropy when I became a trustee of the Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Were there people or incidents or experiences that you used to inform your approach to philanthropy, the formal version of it?As a young man growing up, it was the environment that I spoke of, which set the pace and the tone of my journey of how one makes contributions to make a difference.How is the Sir Ratan Tata Trust changing from its old avatar?We look at our trusts collectively. The bigger ones undertook projects of philanthropy which were very far reaching in those days, be it a cancer hospital or a hotel that would be open to Indians or donations in the interest of tuberculosis. My grandmother gave away all the homes she and her husband had all over India so that sanatoriums for consumptive people, who needed to be isolated, could be made or old peoples homes could be set up. And then a fair amount of philanthropy was in the form of alleviating individual hardships, such as funds for treatment or surgery. We give much more than we did in those days but we are trying to be relevant. We are trying to participate in research for cancer, for diabetes, getting institutes in place to make the treatments affordable and reachable to the common man, looking at agricultural inputs that alleviate poverty in a rural community. What has led to this shift broadly?I cant say that there was a motivator that was defined. For example, one of the big changes has been combating malnutrition today among infants. Just the fact that we are losing so many children in India at infancy. It took only a few weeks of research to realize that we couldnt do that without involving the mother, who is also malnutritioned. We also found out very fast that we couldnt really do much unless we focused on hygiene and sanitation. It become a holistic activity. We undertook pilot projects in eight districts across multiple states to work out the systems for this and its been a real eye-opener. We have received tremendous support from the state government whom we were working with.Any advice for a philanthropist thinking about doing problem solving?The only advice I would give is there is a lot of money that is probably less effectively used or employed because someone has not done enough research on what the problems are. One of the changes we made is that we are no longer a purely grant-giving philanthropic organization. We moved from there into being involved ourselves in some of the projects that we have, we manage them ourselves or jointly with an NGO (non-governmental organization) but not only through an NGO.In the past, we would support an NGO for eight years or 10 years and then move those funds and allocate in another place. You would assume that this community by now would be self-sustaining. But when you withdrew your funds, the NGO collapsed, the community collapsed and you become the most hated person or hated organization there is. Sustainability in development has been a new call and we realize that communities dont need handoutsthey need prosperity and dignity. So our grants today, wherever we give them, put sustainability as one of the mileposts. I mean as far as possible, the idea is to make the community self-sustaining and have the dignity which I think everybody wants. How do you measure your success ?I think to a great extent it is about trying to establish and understanding what the real problems are. You have got to define your goals effectively.What characterizes a professionalized NGO?I cant answer that particularly but sometimes its not scale. Very often an NGO tends to forget the traditional outlooks of a community and ignore it, so that what they try to dohowever well intentioneddoesnt work.What is your assessment of the current state of CSR (corporate social responsibility) in India? And what needs to be done to improve it?I have a sort of philosophical view. The CSR funds have to come from somewhere. I think there would be a fair amount of abuse of these funds and the government will have to do some regulation to make sure that these are effectively used. It would not be a bad thing if the government had defined X number of causes to which you can officially give these funds, which would work for rural prosperity. I think even if large projects, a public works projects, were funded in this way, there is nothing wrong in that but the government may have to define what they are. CSR could become an avenue for innovative thinking on how you can improve the quality of life, and it could be a very powerful toolor it could be wasted. How do you see the state of philanthropy in India?I think the new type of philanthropy that we talked about, that is looking at making donations or making funds available in far-reaching terms, is starting to happen. But a large amount of philanthropy is in the more traditional formsmaybe to build temples or hospitals, not so concerned about what it actually does, but that edifices are created because that establishes that you did A or B or C. I think India has to move like other countries into a more sophisticated form of philanthropy which makes a difference and is designed to make a difference rather than just creating edifices. Do you have a philosophy of philanthropy?If I put it into one sentence, I think you really want to be doing things that make a difference. If you cannot make a difference, if its just water trickling through a tap or leading through a drainage system, its wasteful. Have you changed because of the philanthropy? How has it affected you?Yes I think so. I was the chairman of the trust while I was chairman of Tata Sons. I may have chaired the trust but I didnt spend as much time or have had much depth of involvement as I do today and thats been an eye-opener. I have become more sensitive to the pain and the suffering that exists. I am more involved with where we should do more and where we should be bolder in terms of the amount of money that we allocate. And it also made me more sensitive to the likely abuse of funds.The Bridgespan Group, an adviser and resource for mission-driven leaders and organizations, in partnership with Mint interviewed several philanthropists across India to trace their journeys and share their learningsConversations with Remarkable Givers: India.ALSO READ | Philanthropy benefits the philanthropistALSO READ | How a small donation secures freedomALSO READ | Strategic giving for impact",2016-10-03,eZ5raUtIs7kmScXuchQY9M,Tata Sons chairman emeritus Ratan Tata on why poverty alleviation is key to his philanthropy and why access to natural resources is important to improve lives,03:03,You really want to be doing things that make a difference: Ratan Tata
0.83,"Bengaluru: Bhaskar Bhat, 62, has been at the helm of Tata group firm Titan Co. Ltd for nearly 15 years. His association with the Tata Watch Project, which eventually led to the creation of Titan, has continued for more than three decades, during which he has seen the Titan brand expand from watches into jewellery, eyewear and precision engineering.
				   
				About four months ago, Titan entered yet another categorytraditional womens wearas part of a pilot project, while watches and jewellery continue to be its mainstay, accounting for a major portion of its revenue. Unlike the jewellers in the unorganized sector who have been hit by demonetization, Titan expects the governments move to help boost its sales in the longer run. The company estimates it has less than 5% market share in jewellery and therefore abundant headroom for growth.As of now there are no acquisition plans in the pipeline, says Bhat, and the companys focus is on integrating brands such as CaratLane in jewellery and Favre-Leuba in watches and Maison Montblancwhich makes jewellery, writing instruments and leather goodsas all these were acquired less than two years ago. In an interview, Bhat spoke about the companys key business segments and the fillip it expects from demonetization. Edited excerpts:How has this fiscal year shaped up so far and what kind of growth rate do you expect over the next two years?Overall, like we reported, we had been growing in the first six months, by a small amount, but still, growth was there. In fact, we even said that were expecting a 15% growth in the jewellery business and we expect to clock those numbers. In watches also, the growth rates are better than last year. So the year as such is better, that much I can say. We will be able to keep our current rate of growth, i.e. 15%. Whether it will be much more for FY18 and the year after, we cannot say. But for us FY18 will be better than the current year primarily because demonetization has, in a way, sucked the winds out of the sails of the unorganized sector. Do you expect any fallout from demonetization on Titans future performance? Right now I can confidently say that the concerns because of demonetizationfor instance, concerns that there is no cash for daily transactions so I wont buy watcheshas diminished considerably. It was an event that has affected most companies and we have also articulated that we did get affected in the first week to 10 days. After that, normalcy has come back; the informal (unorganized) economy was affected whereas it has not affected us. In the end, consumers have to buy jewellery, watches and eyewear. If the unorganized sector is not able to give them the product, theyll have to come to us, right?Companies that were doing business in black will not be able to transform to our kind of model or any other kind of model where you accept credit cards and cheques, you keep your books of accounts and you pay taxes. Thats not a transition which will occur easily. And that is where the demand which is there, fundamentally, will flow to companies that can and have been operating legitimately.Youve said in the past that the jewellery industry will be full of turmoil due to policy changes. Is that still your expectation, in particular for this year? Over the past two years, there has been considerable turmoil in the jewellery industry. Gold-on-lease was stopped and later restored, customs duty was increased from 6% to 10%. Then excise duty was introduced and, if you remember, stores were closed for 43 days. Disclosing PAN cards was introduced for purchases above Rs5 lakh and then further dropped to those over Rs 2 lakh. And then we had demonetization. But I think jewellers have now learnt a lesson. At what rate the government decides to impose GST (goods and services tax) is the only other policy change in store and that will benefit us because a lot of the jewellers will have to fall in linedemonetization plus GST is a nightmare for them. So we should benefit from FY18 onward.Which of your jewellery brands are you betting big on and do you expect sales from your Golden Harvest Scheme (GHS) to get a significant boost going ahead?There is a lot of excitement in CaratLane, which we acquired, and Mia. Both are appealing to younger consumers. But between Tanishq, Mia, Zoya, CaratLaneTanishq is certainly the biggest brand. It is a very steady high-growth brand and is at a very high level of sales. Sales from GHS are basically advance booking orders; so youve got a guarantee that one year later at least this much business you will do. Its always been 15-20% of our sales. We aggressively push GHS. Maybe its contribution to sales can increase a little more but I dont see it becoming the new normal.Watches and eyewear have not been doing too well. Whats the plan to boost sales? Watches are bought today as an accessory, not as a time-keeping device. So the strategy is clearly accessorization and premiumization. Getting into the smartwatch segment is also a strategy that weve introduced and were doing well at it. Eyewear has been slow this year, yes. Right now the effort is in ensuring existing stores grow rather than new stores. Growth will come out of the so-called same-store sales growth mantra. Is Titan planning to enter any new categories? We began piloting traditional womens wear in October and are looking at opening a physical store. And we still have to grow perfumes, for example, which is still at a level of Rs30-40 crore. So we dont have any other category in the pipeline. What is your strategy when it comes to competing with online marketplaces? We participate, we dont compete. In watches, we are with online marketplaces like Flipkart and Myntra, and we have a strict contractual obligation with them as to what price they can sell our products at. Discounting is at our behest, not theirs and they have agreed to this so theyve become a partner. The biggest advantage we have is we have offline stores. Our strategy has always been omnichannel but there are very big advantages of bricks and mortar, which I think bricks-and-mortar companies need to play up and not just assume that everybody is going to migrate to online. The need to go to a store is least in watches, because watches you can buy online also, and highest in jewellery. The higher the ticket size, the more risk-averse people will get. So convenience is not everything when you are buying. And I think this trend of buying eyewear online is a passing phase. People will realize that unless you get the quality that you want, it can be quite bad. If your lens is not good enough, for example, its a risk. You also cant touch and feel your frame (before placing an order online). Youve been associated with Titan, and earlier the Tata Watch Project for about three decades. What would you say is the one significant event in the history of the company? We didnt know a thing about retail. So the first retail store we opened in Safina Plaza (a shopping complex in central Bengaluru) in the late 1980s was very memorable. It was a 350-square-foot store but it was very well designed. I remember we sold 17 watches on the first day and we were very thrilled! That was a significant event in the life of Titanthe introduction of retailing.When you look back, I dont think we ever dreamt that we would be a watches, and jewellery, and eyewear, and precision engineering company. It was inconceivable. We were just about relieved that wed got government approval to get into the watch industry and that we were able to make good watches and overtake HMT in five-six years. After that, its been kind of a dream run.",2017-02-04,eokVM94g0SpP1h72Lt1VFO,Titan MD Bhaskar Bhat on integrating brands such as CaratLane  and why he expects the jewellery business to get a boost from demonetisation,00:41,"Titan will maintain current growth rate over two years, says Bhaskar Bhat"
0.36,"Wipro Ltd reported another quarter of sluggish revenue growth; in constant currency terms, revenue grew just 0.9% in the September quarter. Besides, it has guided for growth of only 0-2% in the December quarter.
				   
				But investors have got used to sub-par growth rates from the company. Whats unusual is the aggression it has shown lately in trying to get out of this low-growth rut.On Thursday, Wipro announced the acquisition of Appirio Inc., a US-based cloud services firm for $500 million. The firm has annual revenue of less than $200 million, implying a pricey tag of around 2.5 times revenue. Note that such firms typically operate with single-digit operating margins, which means the price-earnings valuation of the asset may be as high as 50-70 times.Analysts are convinced the deal will be earnings dilutive in the near term. But they are also excited about the companys prospects. Appirio is one of the largest independent cloud services implementation partner for SaaS (software as a service) vendors such as Salesforce and Workday. Wipro  also gets access to one of the largest crowdsourcing communities called Topcoder. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients, The acquisition leapfrogs Wipro in Salesforce and Workday implementation over other Indian IT (firms) and places it among the top-5 players globally along with IBM, Accenture and Deloitte. Besides, they said the deal would enhance Wipros ability to take this capability to its existing large clients; improves its digital positioning and also open up opportunities for integrated deals as opposed to simple reliance on implementation revenue.While Wipro is already present in this segment, revenue from the practice stood at just $40 million. Analysts at Nomura said the acquisition will put Wipro ahead of its Indian IT peers, besides helping the company transition well in the ongoing shift from on-premise software to SaaS.On 11 February, Wipro announced the $460 million acquisition of HealthPlan Services, a leading business process as a service (BPaaS) provider in the US health insurance market. It had also closed in on another BPaaS provider, Viteos, although the deal was called off after it took too long to close. Kotaks analysts point out that the company is also actively engaged in in-house development of BPaaS solutions, and has been investing in platforms and intellectual property. Wipro is playing quick catch up after initial lag in digital with clear identifiable bets. Some of the acquisitions will hurt the P&L (profit and loss) and lead to dilution of earnings. Wipro is willing to take the hit in order to create a more sustainable growth engine and business model, the analysts said in the note.Peers have been relatively cautious and have lagged in terms of investments in emerging technology and solutions. As a result, their growth, too, has slowed, while competitors such as Accenture Plc have done far better, thanks to numerous acquisitions in recent years.Of course, the Streets response to Wipros deals has been a bit restrained. The companys shares have underperformed again this year. One reason is investors tend to be myopic and focus on short-term performance. The other is that Wipro, like most Indian IT firms, doesnt have a great track record of integrating acquisitions well. According to analysts at JPMorgan India Pvt. Ltd, Infocrossing, the companys last large acquisition, had not helped Wipro consolidate its then-leadership position in IT infrastructure-management. It was acquired for $600 million in August 2007. If anything, they add, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd took over leadership in infra-management despite Wipros large acquisition.But clearly, Wipro cant be faulted for not trying.

-0.16,"The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday gave the green signal to Tata Sons Ltd to hold a planned shareholder meeting on 6 February, which will consider a proposal to remove former chairman Cyrus P Mistry as a director from its board. 
				   
				The tribunal refused to grant a stay despite being pressed by the counsel of Mistrys family investment firms, Aryama Sundaram. This bench has not passed any stay on the EGM (extraordinary general meeting) scheduled for 6th February. ... Relief (to Mistry family firms) is recused. Now either the petitioner can file an appeal or be bound by an order, said B.S.V. Prakash Kumar, one of the two members of the NCLT bench.Earlier this month, the Mistry firms filed a contempt of court petition seeking a stay on the Tata Sons EGM. This has been dismissed by the NCLT, which asked the firms to club it with their original petition alleging mismanagement of Tata Sons and oppression of minority shareholders. Cyrus Mistry was ousted as chairman of Tata Sons in a boardroom putsch on 24 October.The bench asked Sundaram, the counsel for Cyrus Investments Pvt. Ltd and Sterling Investments Pvt. Ltd, to argue the merits of the original petition. Sundaram asked the NCLT to first clarify whether the petition was maintainable. In its response to the Mistry family firms petition, Tata Sons had said that the two firms were not qualified to file such a petition because they didnt hold enough equity under Company Act rules.Cyrus Investments and Sterling Investments together own 18.4% of the ordinary shares of Tata Sons, but only 2.17% if preference shares are included, said the holding company of the Tata group. Similarly, the Tata Trusts, which control two-thirds of Tata Sons, said that any suit filed against them needed the permission of the charity commissioner.This (equity) class of shareholders is affected and since we form 18% of the equity shareholders, the petition is maintainable and we have the right to appeal if we feel there is going to be a change in the board. Changes in the board are done through EGMs, which qualifies equity shareholders only to vote. Since we form 18% of that class, the petition is valid and maintainable, Sundaram argued.This did not work.This bench is virtually perplexed. None of the judgments of the Supreme Court or sections of the Companies Act cited by the petitioner counsel is in relation to the matter of maintainability. Moreover, normally maintainability point will be taken from the respondent side. But here the petitioner is arguing on the point of maintainability, said Prakash Kumar.The bench expressed its displeasure, saying that the Mistry family firms counsel was not cooperating with the proceedings. The tribunal said it will not spell out the judgement on maintainability separately and will hear  arguments on maintainability only as a part of the overall arguments made on the original petition. It asked Sundaram to argue on the merits of the original petition on 13 February, the next day of the hearing. After concluding hearings on behalf of the Mistry firms, the tribunal will hear Tata Sons arguments on 20 and 21 February.While agreeing to postpone the hearing from Mistrys side by two weeks, Prakash Kumar said, The petitioner counsel cant argue on the matter and is only asking for adjournment. Content in the petitioner counsels argument is a clear recusal from the direction given by the court. The meaning is that he cant and is not ready to argueThe road map was already laid out on 22 December and thereafter on 18 January. As the court earlier said, there was enough time given to the petitioner counsel. After the hearing, Sundaram told reporters that the Mistry family firms will look at other options to get a stay on the 6 February EGM.Now we may want to take other remedies against the order (the oral order allowing the EGM on 6 February) so we asked (for an) adjournment, said Sundaram.",2017-01-31,fYoDQOVgWTMiVp90MagHXM,"NCLT to next hear counsel for Cyrus Mistrys family firms on 13 February, Tata Sons on 20-21 February",23:44,"NCLT clears Tata Sons EGM on 6 Feb, asks Mistry counsel to argue first petition"
0.01,"Singapore: Whats a nice round figure to take to a job interview? If the position in question is chairman of Tata group, there might be three of them: $40 billion; 2020; and 250 basis points.
				   
				Thats the value of the Indian conglomerates outstanding debt, and there are several reasons it needs to be discussed before pay and perks.For one thing, investors will hound the next chief for answers. About 90% of the Tata loans and bonds are on the books of publicly listed companies whose shareholders are nervous about the recent sacking of the groups chairman after less than four years at the helm.Market value of Tata groupCyrus Mistry has lashed out against his dismissal by warning of a possible $18 billion in asset writedowns. Discount that estimate for wounded pride, but theres no denying that some of the businesses Mistry described as legacy hot spots do have lousy credit metrics. Tata Teleservices Maharashtra Ltd.s debt exceeds 11 years of the wireless carriers earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Ditto for Tata Steel Ltd. The debt-to-Ebitda multiple at Indian Hotels Co., owner of the Taj group, is approaching eight times.Then theres the niggling issue of bunched-up repayments, the second topic toward which the aspiring chairman must steer the interview. Given that 30% of the Tata group debt originally contracted in US dollars, and more than 60% of the British-pound borrowings, will need to be repaid or refinanced in 2020, the next chairman must know from his recruiters what it is that they wish to tell international creditors about strategy before then.Much of the groups debt burden has its genesis in the optimistic expansion in the second of the two decades under Ratan Tata. To the extent his return (albeit as an interim arrangement) has ignited concerns that Mistrys attempts at deleveraging will get shelved, the new full-time boss will be expected to calm nerves. Otherwise, the loans market, which is currently treating even highly leveraged Tata companies with benign neglect, could turn anxious, especially if the ongoing war of words with Mistry casts a lingering shadow on creditor sentiment. A good place to start that uncomfortable conversation may be 250 basis points, which is the spread the group paid over Libor to raise five-year money this year for Tata Steel. For a company thats rated BB- by S&P Global Ratings, the global average for similar dollar loans this year has been 262 basis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Clearly, the 148-year-old Tata brand commands a decent premium in credit markets despite the dead weight of its European steel operations.That privilege could vanish if the bickering doesnt end. The 78-year-old Ratan Tata may have regained control of the conglomerate that bears his familys name, but Mistrys 18.4% stake in the holding company  and board seats across the group  give the 48-year-old a bully pulpit from which he can demand fire sales, especially of assets his older foe is fond of.A confrontation could get messy for the next chairman. Taking three crucial numbers into the interview wont guarantee success in what might prove to be India Inc.s most demanding open job, but making an appearance without them could be a surefire way to end up as collateral damage.

It also asked independent directors of group companies to consider the future of Tata companies when taking decisions. 
				   
				Tata Sons, the group holding company, has been moving aggressively to oust Mistry from group companies.Last week, Tata Sons replaced Mistry as chairman of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and called a shareholder meeting to remove him as a director from the board of the software services company.Tata Sons also moved resolutions to call for shareholder meetings to eject Mistry and Nusli Wadia, an independent director, from the boards of Tata Chemicals Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd, as the spat turns more bitter.Tata Sons actions seem to have been prompted by the independent directors of two group companies unanimously reposing their confidence in Mistry. On Thursday, the independent directors of Tata Chemicals, including Wadia, had backed Mistry as chairman of the board, citing their evaluation of his performance in the past couple of years.Earlier, independent directors of Indian Hotels Co. Ltd had said they supported Mistry to remain as chairman of their board.The Tata Chemicals independent directors resolution led to the resignation of Bhaskar Bhat, a non-executive, non-independent director on its board.Tata Sons reiterates that it is crucially important for boards, including independent directors, to consider that their views and positions ensure that the future of Tata companies is protected, taking into consideration the interest of all stakeholders, the Tata Sons statement said.",2016-11-13,gWkNsfXqYXOEnoqBRWG5iK,Tata Sons wants its independent directors to ensure future of Tata companies and interest of all stakeholders is protected ,21:05,Will do whatever it takes to deal with Cyrus Mistry ouster: Tata Sons
0.58,"This weeks acrimonious separation between the chairman of Tata Group and its majority owners may now be heading for a divorce. Ratan Tata, who returned to head the conglomerate after ousting Cyrus Pallonji Mistry, is looking for a partner to buy the ex-chairmans stake, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.
				   
				Should Mistry agree to sell, how much can he hope to get for his familys 18.4% of Tata Sons Ltd?Bear in mind that following his dismissal, Mistry raised some very serious allegations about both the holding company and several of its biggest publicly traded units. In hitting back at the board that fired him, Mistry said the groups net worth of $26 billion could be impaired by as much as $18 billionshrinking to just $8 billionshould writedowns be needed at businesses like Tata Steel Ltds European operations; Tata Motors Ltds passenger car business (ex-Jaguar Land Rover, the jewel in the empires crown); Indian Hotels Co.s overseas Taj properties; one of Tata Power Ltd.s plants; and a floundering wireless telecom venture with NTT Docomo Inc.As a seller, Mistry is unlikely to behave anything like a spurned chairman trying to score debating points. To maximize value, he might say he overestimated the risk of Armageddon. He might even admit the possibility that Ratan Tatas return to a conglomerate he chaired for two decades will reinvigorate the operating companies. Maybe Tata cant repeat a near sevenfold increase in book value over the period 2004-2012, but if global steel demand stabilizes, theres a fair chance the groups assets could reach a book value of $28 billion after a year. In the base-case scenario, the coffee-to-cars-to-software conglomerate wont be any worse off, and its assets would be worth in 2017 what they are today: $26 billion.Now suppose that status quo has a likelihood of 50%, while the probability of a massive writedown is 20%, and that of an improvement is 30%. That gives a one-year-forward book value of $23 billion. Considering that General Electric Co. trades at three times its estimated book value for next year, and companies in the more diversified Tata Group sell at 4.8 times, Mistry could perhaps ask for a halfway-house multiple of 3.75 times, valuing his 18.4% stake at a little under $16 billion.Only a patient investor who cares more about growth than current income would be willing to write that check. After all, the dividend received from operating companies yielded just 1.6% on Tata Sons investment last year, according to the Economic Times. An investor who paid a multiple of 3.75 to relieve Mistry of his stake would earn a divided yield of 0.4%.As for Mistry himself, at $16 billion, he would walk away with an annualized 4.5% return on the $200 million loan the Tata family took from outsiders 91 years ago. Include past dividends, and he might even have matched or beaten the 9% annual return from the US stock market since 1928. Thats hardly a divorce to feel unhappy about.

-0.01,"Bengaluru: Tata Group chairman Cyrus Mistry has a new worry in the growing pile of troubles afflicting Indias largest conglomerate. How to revive growth at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), which accounts for 16% of the groups $103.5 billion revenue?
				   
				The troubles at Tata Motors Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd are well-documented. Despite TCS reporting a 3.7% sequential dollar revenue growth in the April-June period, the company is likely to report weak numbers in the second quarter, results of which will be declared on 13 October.Worryingly for investors, TCS now risks growing at a slower clip this year than last year, when its revenue expanded 7.1%, the slowest annual growth at TCS since 2009, when Natarajan Chandrasekaran took charge as its chief executive. TCS is expected to report an at-best 1.6% sequential dollar growth in the second quarter, according to brokerage BNP Paribas. This, on the back of 3.7% growth in the first quarter, translates into TCS doing $8.79 billion business in the first six months of the current financial year. TCS now needs more than $8.92 billion in revenue in second half of the year if it intends to grow at 7.1% this year. Simply put, TCS will need to record a better show in the October-March period this year than in the second half of last year. This certainly is a tall task as technology outsourcing firms report soft growth in the second half of the financial year.Undoubtedly, Chandrasekaran faces a tough task given the size of TCS.At the heart of TCSs slow growth is its inability to build a stronger consulting practice and reluctance to buy small firms for technologies like design consulting and automation platform providers. These tiny buyouts not just improve the current solution deliveries but also bring in growth. May be now, Mistry could nudge Chandrasekaran to start buying.With this as a backdrop, Mint puts the spotlight on five things to watch in TCSs second quarter earnings on 13 October:1. Revenue growthBrokerage BNP Paribas expects TCSs dollar revenue to rise 1.6% to $4.43 billion in the July-September period on a sequential basis. This is a big worry as this will mean that TCS needs to put forward its best foot forward in the remaining six months of the year if it wants to save itself from the humiliation of recording an even slower growth than last year. Management commentary on demand levels from its customers in Europe, after Britain voted to leave the EU, will be crucial.2. Pressure on profitability poses a double whammySince January this year, TCSs operating margins have been under pressure. TCSs 26.1% Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin at the end of March quarter was 54 basis points less than margins at the end of October-December period last year. The companys margins further contracted to 25.1% at the end of March quarter, which the management claimed to be largely on account of annual wage hikes. Now, as commoditized deals come under further pricing pressure, and TCS continues to spend money in reskilling its workforce and building digital technologies, traditional levers like going slow on hiring, will not be enough to offset the gradual decline in profitability. Analysts say that TCS is unlikely to end the current financial year with its stated guidance of 26-28%.3. What really is the problem among TCSs BFSI clients in the US?On 7 September, TCS in a mid-quarter update, said that some holding back of discretionary spending particularly in the BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance clients) vertical in the United States had led to sequential loss of momentum at the company. Is this just an one-off development or does this suggest a structural malaise? We know all IT vendors are seeing less business from big banks as these banks are spending less in application development work. Homegrown technology vendors are further seeing erosion in current revenue from the embrace of automation platforms, which is cannibalizing the existing model of billing clients on human hours. 4. Rain check of weak sectors and geographiesTCS does not expect growth to rebound in Japan. The company claims to have arrested any loss of business from its UK-based insurance platform Diligenta. Growth from telecoms segment continue to be wobbly. Together, an underperformance from the three units eroded about 2% growth from the companys 11.9% growth on constant currency basis in 2015-16. TCS needs to report some growth on a consistent basis if it has to better last years growth.5. Is higher net erosion of existing business biting into TCSs growth?During the July-September period last year, TCS claimed its order book was the strongest ever, with about 30% more than the company ever managed in any quarter. The company, however, does not disclose its order book size. Outsourcing deals are long-term contracts, and IT vendors can generate only about 3-4% of revenue from new orders in the first year, according to JPMorgan Chases George. Agreed, IT firms lose about 3-5% of current business every year, which in TCSs case, translates into a loss of about $500-825 million a year. This clearly suggest that TCS is losing more business from existing clients because even some business generated from its record order book has not offset the annual loss of business, thereby resulting in a sluggish y-o-y growth.",2016-10-12,hesaBaeP0eIEHrwSnqJO5K,TC is likely to report weak numbers in the second quarter and risks growing at a slower clip this year than last year,01:16,TCS Q2 earnings: Five things to watch for today
-0.05,"Bengaluru: It has been a little over 15 months since R. Seshasayee became the non-executive chairman of Infosys Ltd. His term coincides with a very interesting time for the company, which is trying to regain its tag as the bellwether of the Indian IT industry under its first non-founder chief executive, Vishal Sikka.
				   
				In an interview, Seshasayee explained his equation with Sikka, the changing role of the board, the challenges it faces, its relationship with the company founders, what he likes about Sikkas leadership style and why it is wrong to say that Infosys has twin power structures. Edited excerpts:Is Infosys in a better shape now than when you started in this role?Firstly, the change at the leadership level, to have someone like Vishal (Sikka) come (in), has (given) a very clear strategic direction to the company, given the changing landscape in the industry. That is a very big step forward.From the boards perspective, it is very important to have the right leader, and I believe we have the right leader. From the boards perspective, it is important that the leader articulates the strategy (and) the board is aligned to this strategy. I can categorically say that the board is fully aligned to this strategy Vishal has sketched.I and the board feel extremely good that this strategic change in direction to meet the new demands in the business landscape has gone down very well. To communicate this kind of a change in an organization that is as large as Infosys is not easy.Now, of course we have the execution challenges. And those are things which we will learn as we go along. We have had a few bumps. We have had some quick learning. I think, by and large, the strategy is getting executed with the right speed and in the right direction. What is the boards role in designing this strategy?Ideally, the board should pick the right leader for the company and the leader should articulate the strategy. The board has an active role to play for sure in understanding the strategic proposal, challenging that, and getting an alignment between the management and the board. The board cannot stand aside and say that all this is strategic direction and not our problem. The board has to be fully engaged in (the) formulation of strategy.We have had in the last couple of years a pretty deep level of engagement. The board does not meet only for board meetings for approving what is put on the table. So the engagement has been continuous. It has not been even that it takes place (just) once a quarter.The second is that I also think that it is important to think for the board to be learning. Learning is an important DNA of Infosys. Learning does not just apply to executives, the rank and file of management. It equally applies to members of the board. We have had systematic immersion sessions. And our intent is to intensify these sessions. Intent is to make sure that we are not merely sitting and listening in these sessions.This is a journey. It is never-ending. But I do think both these continuous engagement and continuous learning are making it possible to have a very constructive dialogue with the leadership. What are the big challenges faced by the board?I cannot think of a company of this size which has gone through transformation simultaneously on three fronts. The first is the business transformation. All IT firms are going through this, simply because (their) clients are going through this transformation. That is one massive transformation. That is pervasive and happening all across.The second is the move from (being) an iconic promoter-led organization to an organization that is professionally managed at the management and board level. I was actually looking at how many top 100 companies in India have entirely professional board and professional management. If you leave aside the banks and the public sector undertakings, perhaps Infosys is the only company. From a governance construct, this is a very unique and desirable construct, one which would be the ideal construct. But this transformation from a promoter-managed organization to a professional-managed organization both happening at the same time, is a huge transformation. Actually the average tenure of the board, if I leave aside Jeff (Professor Jeffrey Lehman), is two-and-a-half years. So you have a completely new set of people.And so, to be able to navigate this huge company in the right direction, from the point of view of both strategic (issues) and governance, that requires a great deal of work, and a great deal of rescripting of the playbook.We have had challenges in the first quarter. We have had some challenges (with) a couple of good leaders, whom we would have liked to retain, not being there. We have had some challenges regarding the perception issue into governance. I dont think these are real issues but perception issues. But we have very quickly learnt and we are putting in very quickly in place the right kind of solutions. That is the second kind of transformation which we are scripting very well.And then there is the third kind of transformation which is the cultural transformation. From a company that had been pretty much India-centric, we are truly now global-minded. This is a cultural shift. So, in some sense, we need to reset the needle. Each of these transformations is itself a challenge. It may not be apparent to someone on the outside. There is some criticism that Infosyss board does not have enough people with a technology background. Im hearing this for the first time that we do not have enough people from tech background on the board. We have Vishal and (chief operating officer) Pravin (Rao).Beyond Vishal and Pravin?Let me explain the diversity we have on the board. We have Ravi (Venkatesan), who has spent years in technology at Microsoft. Of course, we have Roopa (Kudva) and Punita (Kumar-Sinha). Look at their background. They have not been only in one industry. Roopa has spent a lifetime at a variety of industries, evaluating, assessing, rating a variety of industries. And so has Punita. We have people dealing with different firms, including technology firms. Then we have people like Jeff and John (Etchemendy) who bring the academic discipline to it. Kiran (Mazumdar-Shaw) is a very entrepreneurial person. We have a very good diverse group of people. Having said that, we are constantly on the lookout for the right kind of talent. We are pretty much looking at every possible skill where we think we have a gap and which we think we need to bring in. So we are looking at people. So that is a continuous process. We have people on the board who can read the future, have good understanding of technology trends, are able to challenge the strategic direction. We do take external inputs where we need. So those people dont have to be on the board.So could you perhaps expand the board?We are on the lookout, and we have some candidates in mind and we will do it at the right time.Help us understand the boards relationship with the company founders.So this iconic institution has been created by an iconic leader (N.R. Narayana) Murthy and his wonderful team. This is an outstanding or exceptional kind of history where Murthy and team decided to step down or step away. I must tell you categorically that while I have personally a lot of communication happening with Murthy, not once even by accident have the promoters asked for information which is not available to the public. That must be said to the credit of the promoters that they have not sought any information which would give them any preferential access to any information.We talk about many things. We talk about perceptions that you might have from what is available in the public domain, about the kind of strategic direction. And I take his advice very seriously. But that said, the board has the responsibility to do what is right for the institution. The board is closest to the facts and the situation on the ground.And therefore, information and facts, which are available to the board must drive the board in the right direction, and that decision will be of the board only. Do you think the founders could have expressed their unhappiness with certain board decisions such as Sikkas compensation or Kumar-Sinhas appointment differently?This is a question that should not be asked to me, since this is what the promoters chose to do; so it will not be fair for me to respond. From the boards perspective, we have advice coming from many other investors and not just the promoters. If you believe we do not have discussions with any other investors, you are wrong. The conversations we have with the promoters are no different than those we have with other investors. So it is not right for me to be second-guessing on what they should do. Were you a little saddened by the way they expressed their displeasure?This is a free world and everybody has their own viewpoint. So, do I get saddened by the percentage of negative votes on anything? No. I have a job to do, and we have some 99 percentage in favour and that is a resounding endorsement of the boards recommendation. We should just move on. What issues do you seek their advice on? There are many issues on which I seek advice from many people. So why would you want to only look at what Im seeking from Mr Murthy. Murthy has been a friend for 30 years. We have worked together on boards. We were together on the board of ICICI, we have worked together on many other forums. So he is one person I respect, like other people. So I dont see anything unusual in that. There is this perception that there are twin power centres at Infosys: Murthy and Sikka.First, there is no such twin power centres. That is completely wrong, and that will be very unfair to the promoters. Because, like I mentioned, Murthy has been an exceptional leader who has chosen to stay away and only give advice when sought from. So it will be utterly wrong. Now, the second thing is that when you say there is this perception. Now I dont want to deal with perceptions. We must deal with reality. Im dealing with reality. The reality is that what I have clearly said.What are the issues on which Sikka seeks your advice?Because of the fact that we have a very unique construct, the engagement of the board (with Sikka) has been continuous. My engagement with Vishal has been more intense than the rest of the board. I think we speak almost every week, sometimes multiple times a week. We discuss different issues, say related to people, organization, performance, relating to issues on strategy, customers. We discuss also spirituality and philosophy on weekends. We have an excellent rapport and relationship. We have a lot of common interests. Last night, we were talking on pure sciences. So, the foundation of the relationship is one of complete mutual trust, and complete transparent sharing of information and views. So there are many things that we do.How is the board helping Sikka in this transformation? Its a two-way constructive process. Its not on the basis of a paper that is put on the table. The way it is being done is through continuous, comprehensive and concerted engagement.What is the toughest issue you have advised him on so far?The toughest discussions we have had are on philosophy.Is Vishals compensation of $11 million a year linked to Infosys clocking $20 billion by March 2021?The compensation is linked to targets which are publically given. There is a trajectory for this. The compensation is linked to that trajectory. This is something which the board and Vishal have discussed and agreed.Can you help us understand the weightage of the three specific targets (total revenue, revenue per employee, operating margin) on Sikkas variable pay?There is probably no other Indian company which has so clearly linked pay to targets which have been made public. To my mind, this is the most transparent way of getting shareholders approval. In the trajectory, we have to take into account many things. We need to take into account the industry dynamics, the company dynamics, the people dynamics, all of that. Thats something which the board is charged with the responsibility to do and we will do so.Can you give us some details about the trajectory itself?Can you tell me another company that has been giving the targets for the compensation of the chief executive? There is good reason why no other company does this. It is not because this is inconvenient or anything. It is because, as I said, its a very dynamic situation. Every month, we see changes in the landscape. Every month, we see new challenges. The board is a delegated authority of the shareholders to run this company. It is therefore in the fitness of things that the board does the job that has been entrusted by the shareholders. It doesnt kick back to the shareholders the job that has been entrusted. We have gone one step further to say, yes this long-term goal is what we believe must be the reference point for the compensation.So is it more aspirational in nature?No, I have said that there is nothing aspirational in this. This is a target which the company is looking at, is pursuing. Now nothing is cast in stone. But this is, at the moment, the target that we have.Are you saying that the growth of the industry will also be taken into account?The growth of the industry is pretty much the playfield, right? So we have got to look at the growth of the industry in the context of assessment.(For any company,) the target is fixed for the annual budget in the context of what you see is the market situation. Technology changes, all of it are taken into account. A five-year goal is fixed on what you believe is the kind of the trajectory in this. We have to keep constantly calibrating both the environment and the industry. As of now, we are not changing those targets (for Infosys).Can they be changed?Thats a speculative question. Why did the board change its original plan on the promised payment to former chief financial officer Rajiv Bansal?All I can say is I have already made the statement suo motu in the AGM (annual general meeting). You wrote this article (referring to Mints story in May on Bansals unusually high severance pay). Because you wrote this article, I thought it is important and it is our responsibility to make sure that we address this issue. So the issue was not raised in the AGM, but I made a suo motu statement saying that we believe that there is no impropriety.There is a severance agreement. There are rights of the parties in the contract. And the contract will be administrated in line with the rights of the parties. Period. That is all. So has there been any change in the agreement?That is not something you need to be looking at all. I am only saying there is a contract, (there are) the rights of the parties in the contract and the contract will be administered in line with the contractual rights of the parties. Period.So is it fair to assume that you could rework it if one of the parties did not abide by its terms?This is an entirely legal issue. All I need to say is that there are no other extraneous considerations for this, for the administration of this. It will be driven by the contractual rights. Has anything happened within the realms of that contract that could lead to a change in it?No matter where you are coming from, the only two things which are relevant to the public and relevant to everybody else (are): Is this an issue where there is impropriety? I have said no, repeatedly no, and I stand by that.Is this contract getting changed or cancelled for any other extraneous considerations? I am going a step further to say: The contract will be administered based on the rights of the parties in the contract. Period.How do you like Sikkas leadership style?We have the right kind of leader in Vishal. His understanding of the changes, his insight into the changes is outstanding. Vishals articulation of a solution, even in the context of the auto industry for example or the banking industry, is absolutely on the dot. We have a very good leader who understands client requirements and his client connect is exceptional. His strategic direction is exceptional. He has been a phenomenal person to motivate a very, very large crowd. Its not easy for a new person to step in and have this kind of influence. We certainly have an exceptional leader.How has the boards role at a company changed?The role of a board has changed phenomenally, and for the good. It is no longer this friends club that you had in the past and people coming to have a cup of coffee and go back. This is the trusteeship concept. That is getting to be far better understood now by enlightened boards, and therefore, the responsibility that comes with that. In the process, the engagement is getting to be much more. Increasingly, I find that the board meeting is just one punctuation mark in that engagement. It also brings in the need for a greater amount of understanding of the business and the independence to challenge.

				Hospitals, especially in India, have for long cut a sorry figure in terms of their digital savvy and use of information technology (IT) to be on par with their counterparts in sectors such as banking and telecom.According to Tirupathi Karthik, CEO of Napier Healthcare, a Singapore-based provider of software solutions to the healthcare industry, As compared to a global average of 22.5% of income spent on IT by healthcare providers, or even 6-15% being invested in IT in other sectors within India, anecdotal data from multiple sources indicate that healthcare providers in India rarely spend more than 0.5% of their annual revenue on information technology.  But things have been changing for some time, albeit at a pace slower than many would want. Leading the change are large hospital chains such as Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd, Max Healthcare Institute Ltd and Fortis Healthcare Ltd.Prodded on by the need to take control of their sprawling operationswhich span dozens of hospitals in multiple citieson the one hand, and the rising expectations of tech-empowered consumers on the other, these modern hospitals are setting the template for healthcare in India.High time they did so. If you looked at the hospitals in India around 10 years back, they were very basic in terms of tech infrastructure. Besides, independent doctors got what they pretty much wanted. This led to lack of control with the management and poor visibility into the entire treatment and costs hospitals had to bear, says Varun Gera, founder and chief executive of HealthAssure Pvt. Ltd, a primary  healthcare aggregator that has partnered with almost 2,300 clinics, including diagnostic labs and hospital OPDs (out-patient departments). He says that somewhere along the line hospitals had to work as hospitals and it could no longer be the case of doctors having their own way of doing things. While part of this doctors-management clash had to do with egos, a more significant role was played by ITthe lack of it in the early days and increasing enablement as time went on. It is the clinical protocols, organisation-wide processes and use of IT tools through which hospitals, particularly those with a corporate road map to grow fast, could gain better control, get visibility into how treatment is given, and embrace more standardization for better healthcare outcomes across their chain of facilities.Once processes and IT tools began to be adopted, hospitals moved on from using basic networking and hospital information systems (HIS) to looking at electronic medical records (EMRs) and other advanced deployments for improving efficiency as well as patient care.According to research firm Gartner Inc., Indian healthcare providers are set to spend $1.2 billion on IT products and services in 2016, including telecom services.  Among the key areas in which hospitals are increasingly focusing their IT efforts are online doctor appointments, data capture of patients visiting the hospitals and applying analytics tools to get insights into their operations.One of the large hospital chains investing big time in IT is Apollo. One of the things we have done is enabled online appointment for doctors. Earlier, less than 10% of our patients came by appointment. Now at Apollo almost 50% of patients are coming by appointment, says Sangita Reddy, joint managing director, Apollo Hospitals.That is a huge change in terms of avoiding the chaos resulting from a lot of patients just landing up at its hospitals all over India. It also allows Apollo to focus on the more important task of clinical care rather than manage hordes of patients shuffling from one department to the other on its premises.More significant change is afoot through the use of data analytics for both clinical and non-clinical insights. We are collecting about 55% of all our patients clinical data electronically, which is enabling us to create a digital warehouse. This digital warehouse, in turn, is enabling us to do data mining and use this data in different ways, says Reddy.These efforts are helping Apollo in workflow prediction, staffing, communication, etc., and helping the organization turn into a data-driven enterprise.One of the key areas in which analytics is being applied at Apollo, according to Reddy, is the use of predictive analytics for clinical purposes. We have pioneered the concept of personalized health check-ups in India: instead of a common check-up, it is customized based on analytics of data of almost 1 million patients that have visited our hospitals over the years, she says. The decision tree for providing healthcare is being evolved based on scenario building through matching a particular medicine with a particular disease or condition that previous patients had encountered. The result is quicker treatment with improved outcomes.The analytics tool enhances the effectiveness of the medication that doctors choose, says Reddy.On the question of the acceptance of such tools by the medical fraternity, she says, We use these predictive analytics tools in a recommendatory manner, so its not forced on the doctorsand we have found a very high degree of acceptance. Currently being used in its large hospitals, Apollo will soon extend its use to other hospitals as well.There is a lot of scope for improvement in the way hospitals in India operate and use IT to manage operations and deliver healthcare in a seamless manner taking into account the intricacies involved in settling health insurance claims. According to Gera, The whole focus now is on getting the data out and efficiency of operations. The way hospitals operate currently is much fractured, as there are multiple complexities involved in their operations.And while technology cannot do everything for hospitals, the right tools and processes can make a big difference to the quality and speed of healthcare delivery in India.Among the tools for improving or aiding clinical outcomes, International Business Machines Corp.s Watson cognitive computing solutions for healthcare are being considered by many hospitals in India. One of the first to implement it is Manipal Hospital Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. According to IBM, Watson for Oncology is now in use by oncologists at six locations in the Manipal Hospitals network to provide information and insights to physicians to help them identify personalised, evidence-based cancer care options across India.If the past decade signified the modernisation of hospitals in terms of physical infrastructure, medical equipment and the like, the next one is likely to be defined by integration of multiple IT tools, advanced analytics solutions, health monitoring devices and Internet of Thingsunder which medical devices, computer systems, smartphones and diagnostic equipment will share data with each other in real time for individualised, improved healthcare.",2016-11-04,iX1AMyGsjOevaUwtoZVn4N,"Hospitals have for long cut a sorry figure in terms of digital savvy and the use of information technology.

0.4,"Tata Sons Ltds failure to communicate with stakeholders to explain the trust deficit that it said had prompted Cyrus Mistrys ouster last month has reinforced a perception of opacity around the exit, proxy advisory firms and investors said on Tuesday.
				   
				In a research note released on Tuesday, Institutional Investor Advisory Service (IiAS) said independent directors of listed Tata group companies must provide comprehensive guidance to shareholders on whether Mistry should remain chairman of these firms.And, if boards of the listed companies are divided in their support of Mistry, there is a risk of the boards becoming dysfunctional, IiAS warned.On 27 October, three days after deciding to replace Mistry, Tata Sons released a statement in which it said: The Directors of the Tata Sons board had repeatedly raised queries and concerns on certain business issues, and Trustees of the Tata Trusts were increasingly getting concerned with the growing trust deficit with Mr. Mistry, but these were not being addressed. The Tata Sons board, in its collective wisdom, took the decision to replace its chairman in the manner undertaken.Tata Trusts are the single-largest shareholders in Tata Sons.The holding company has not elaborated on the trust deficit, and Tata Sons board is effectively asking investors to blindly trust it, IiAS said.In the research note, IiAS said it was important for Tata Sons to communicate to its companies boards the rationale to dethrone Cyrus Mistry. Tata Sons can begin by sharing the details of the board evaluation, and the process it followed to conclude that Mistry must be unseated, it said.With public perception veering towards Cyrus Mistry, the Tata group needs to provide factual and cohesive information supporting its decision to balance the discourse. Else it must back down, it added.A top official at a mutual fund company that is invested in various Tata group firms said: The process and the way it has been done is not to our liking, it could have been done in a much better way.On the day Tata Sons announced Mistrys removal, this official, who didnt want to be named, said he received two emails from Mistrys officeone an invitation to attend Tata Day, the global investor meet scheduled for 18 November, and the second to attend an event on 13 December to announce the formation of an investment trust that was to be formed between the Tata Group, BlackRock, McKinsey & Co and other firms to promote long-term investment in the Tata group companies.Both the events have now been rescheduled for next year.Independent directors of Indian Hotels Co. Ltd, which runs the Taj group, have backed Mistry, reposing their confidence in his leadership.State-owned Life Insurance Corp. of India (LIC), which has a significant stake in several Tata group firms, is also likely to back Mistry, said a person aware of the situation, who didnt want to be identified.If theres a resolution to vote for removal of Mistry, LIC may vote against it, he said.In response to questions on the IiAs note and how the company plans to justify the action taken a fortnight ago, a Tata group spokesperson said, These are subjective views of different profiles. Tata Sons on 24 October had said that the board in its collective wisdom and the recommendation of its principal shareholders decided that it may be appropriate in the long-term interest of the Tata Sons and Tata group to replace Mr Mistry. Independent directors have a right to a point of view, he said.The board of directors of Tata Chemicals Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd are set to meet on 10, 11 and 14 November, respectively, to discuss the companies September quarter earnings. It is not clear if the independent directors are  likely to meet ahead of  the quarterly earnings to discuss Mistrys board position.There will obviously be a resolution and it will be taken to a logical conclusion, whatever that may be, said a Tata group official, who declined to be identified.To pass a resolution supporting the removal of Cyrus Mistry as director with a 51% majority, the Tata group will need shareholders supportit only owns about 30-35% of equity in the listed companies of the group other than Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.Amit Tandon, founder and managing director at IiAs, said given the current complexity, going forward, the chain of command becomes very critical among the different entities within the Tata Groupthe Tata Trusts, Tata Sons and the operating companies.Ami Shah and Anirudh Laskar in Mumbai contributed to this story.",2016-11-09,iZlkEZyxqm4Yrh4907wN4J,"Tata group has to provide credible facts that necessitated former chairman Cyrus Mistrys ouster, say proxy advisory firms",01:21,Is trust deficit widening on Tatas narrative on Cyrus Mistry?
0.54,"Bangalore/Mumbai: Amid the carnage on Wall Street in 2008, as Bank of America Corp. was trying to forge its rushed merger with Merrill Lynch & Co., Natarajan Chandrasekaran boarded a plane for New York to try to reassure the two financial behemoths that an Indian IT company could make the systems of their strikingly different cultures work together.
				   
				Chandrasekaran, known as Chandra, was then chief operating officer of Asias largest IT services exporter, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS). Over the following weeks he fended off global rivals who smelled an opportunity to muscle in, and set about integrating the banks systems and assuaging the new managements anxieties about outsourcing to a foreign supplier. TCS kept the business and grew it substantially.Last week, Chandra, now chief executive officer of TCS, was chosen for an even more fraught diplomatic task: to resurrect the image and fortunes of the Tata Group, Indias biggest conglomerate, which has been racked by losses at some of its biggest units, and by a boardroom battle that has threatened to turn the workings of the venerable corporation into a media soap-opera.Tata Sons, the group holding company, named Chandra, 53, as chairman, taking over on 21 February from interim chairman Ratan Tata. Tata, 79, had run the family business for more than two decades before handing over in 2012 to his hand-picked successor, Cyrus Mistry. In October, Tata Sons shocked Indias corporate community by firing Mistry, reinstalling Ratan Tata and promising to find a replacement by March. Chandra was a front runner for the job, a Tata employee almost all his working life, who grew TCS into the conglomerates most successful business, with about $16 billion in sales.Yet he is both an insider and an outsider. While he has been with the group since joining as an intern three decades ago, he is the first chairman who is not a Parsi, the shrinking ethnic group of Zoroastrians that boasts a disproportionately high number of Indias business elite. He is only the third person without the Tata name to get the job, and the first without a close family tie to the Tatas.IT CareerMoreover, his career and success has all been with TCS, virtually an island within the group that serves many of the worlds top corporations with a young, skilled, technical workforce. As head of Tata Sons, he will be responsible for a conglomerate that assembles buses in Zambia, serves prawn kalimiri to diners at its Bombay Brasserie in London, sells salt to Indian families at Rs18(27 cents) a kilo, and runs hundreds of other businesses across the world.He served both TCS and the customer commendably during the BofA-ML merger. Now he has the chance to build a positive organization by bonding together various companies and their half-a-million plus employees, said S. Ramadorai, the previous CEO of TCS. He is non-confrontational and, at the same time, does not foolishly ignore problems.Chandras appointment came after TCS announced it had made the equivalent of $1 billion in quarterly profit for the first time. Tatas star unit accounts for over half of the groups market value.A five-man panel unanimously chose Chandra from a list of more than a dozen candidates. He stood out both within the group and outside, said former bureaucrat Vijay Singh, a non-executive director on the board of Tata Sons, which ratified the selection. A Tata Sons statement said Chandra would uphold the groups values and adhere to its high standard of practicesthings the board previously accused Mistry of failing to do.We are at an inflection point, said Chandra in a statement after his appointment. I am aware that this role comes with huge responsibilities. It will be my endeavor to help progress the group with the ethos, ethics and values that the Tata group has been built on. Chandra declined an interview request for this story.Steel lossesFacing him is a menu of corporate issues, including the money-losing UK operations of Tata Steel Ltd., the overhang from failed ambitions like Tata Motors Ltd.s cheap Nano car, debt-ridden Indian Hotels Co., and a $1.17 billion arbitration battle with telecom partner NTT Docomo Inc. Mistry has previously defended his time as chairman, when he tried to reduce debt built up during a series of global acquisitions by Ratan Tata. In an e-mail to directors after his dismissal, Mistry said the group may face Rs1.18 trillion in writedowns over time because of  legacy hotspots he inherited.Mistry, whose family owns an 18% stake in Tata Sons, filed a case with the National Company Law Tribunal seeking the appointment of an administrator to oversee the companys affairs, a forensic audit and a probe into the role of the trustees of Tata trusts, the majority shareholders of Tata Sons. Hes asked for Ratan Tata, head of the trusts, to be restrained from attending board meetings. A spokesman for Mistry said he would not comment as the matter is subject to the legal proceedings.Investors expect Chandra to act quickly to resolve governance issues, said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director at proxy advisory firm InGovern Research Services Pvt. Key to his success will be how he handles Ratan Tata, who has indicated that he may step down as chairman of the trusts this year. Tata instigated the Nano project, a troubled airline venture and many of the other expansions that are now draining the groups resources.Tata congratulated Chandra on Twitter, saying he was sure the new chairman would protect the groups values and ethics. A Tata Group spokesman declined to comment.Chandra is an optimist, he thinks big and will go after positive outcomes in the new job, said Krishnakumar N., executive chairman of rival Indian IT services company Mindtree Ltd.The son of a farmer in rural southern India, Chandra studied in a Tamil-language school rather than gaining the English-language education favored by the middle class.He joined TCS in 1987 after completing a masters in Computer Applications from Regional Engineering College, Trichy, Tamil Nadu. His leadership talent was spotted by Ramadorai in 1993 when Chandra was praised by customer International Business Machines Corp. He was put in charge of a major project for British Telecommunications Plc. When Ramadorai became TCSs CEO, he chose Chandra as his executive assistant.He loved meeting customers, and it was never a Hi-How-Are-You? kind of a meeting, Ramadorai said in a telephone interview. He put the client at the center of the universe, made every conversation count and nurtured clients like American Express.Young CEOChandra took over as chief executive of TCS in 2009 at the age of 46. Over the next seven years, he would triple the IT companys share price and revenue and more than double its headcount.As Chandras corporate universe expanded, so did his interests, according to colleagues. Hes fond of photography and classical music, but his real passion is running. He has run marathons in Boston, Chicago, Berlin, New York, Tokyo and other cities.Being a runner has greatly shaped my thinking as a leader, Chandra told Runners World in October 2015. You have to decide on the length of the engagement, develop endurance to handle setbacks and increase speed when the competition demands it. You have to perform with your heart and your mind.At TCS, Chandra backed new technologies from cloud to mobile and evangelized to global corporations about digital disruption, always with a reputation for building close relationships with clients. Som Mittal, former head of Hewlett-Packard Co.s India operations, worked with Chandra for years in the software-industry trade body Nasscom and said if he texted Chandra, hed get a call back within 20 minutes.Whether he was preparing for a marathon in London or stepping into a client meeting in New York, he unfailingly called back, no matter what timezone and which corner of the globe he was in, said Mittal. He was also an inveterate traveler who would fly to client meetings even for the smallest deals. He has this uncanny ability of making everyone think they are his dearest friends.Chandra drove projects at TCS that dispersed the chaotic crowds and touts that used to clog the entrances of Indias passport offices and its best-known hospital, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi. He charted new territories for TCS in Latin America and Japan by hiring local talent.His new role comes with a different set of challenges. He will have to stabilize the group and plan a decade or two into the groups future, said Ramadorai. It is a rough road.Looming over him will be the presence of a family that has been royalty in Indias business world for more than a century, and the scion of that family, Ratan Tata.Chandra is not afraid to express opinion and can be extremely firm when he is convinced about something, said Mittal. He is no pushover. Bloomberg",2017-01-16,icSPfNFcGFeEX4LWRyqbnM,Natarajan Chandrasekaran  will take over as chairman of Tata Sons from interim chief Ratan Tata on 21 February ,12:30,N.

				The company is conducting an internal investigation into whether certain payments relating to facilities in India were made improperly and in possible violation of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other applicable laws, it said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Cognizant also announced the resignation of Gordon Coburn, who was effectively the second-in-command at the company. The two announcements coming together was clearly too much for investors to handle. Cognizants shares fell as much as 13.3% on the back of fears that Coburns resignation could be because the scale of the improper payments was significant. According to an analyst, the uncertainty and the lack of clarity is making investors jittery. If government agencies find wrongdoing, there could be a fine in store. Besides, the company may lose business because of reputational issues. About a year ago, The Wall Street Journal had reported that the US government found Wal-Mart Stores Inc. paid bribes worth millions of dollars to local officials in India. The US agencies probing the company havent announced a fine or a settlement yet, but Wal-Mart has spent hundreds of millions of dollars so far investigating the possible payment of foreign bribes. The largest FCPA enforcement action, so far, was in the case of Siemens AG, which paid $350 million in disgorgement to settle SECs charges, and a $450 million fine to the US department of justice (DoJ) to settle criminal charges. In 2014, Alstom SA pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $772 million to end an investigation by DoJ. Of course, the eventual fine or settlement fees will depend on the quantum of improper payments, if any, made by Cognizant, and the extent to which it profited from these payments. Thanks to Coburns resignation, speculation about how severe the hit can be are running wild. Cognizant is already grappling with a slowdown in growth rates; it brought down its revenue growth guidance for 2016 in August, and now expects revenue growth to be in single digits. Since then, commentary by other IT services companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd suggests things have deteriorated. As such, the timing of the corruption probe couldnt be worse.

0.03,"Bengaluru: Wipro Ltd reported third-quarter revenue that missed analysts estimates although it was in line with the managements forecast, and provided a weak outlook for the fourth quarter, mirroring the challenges faced by rivals in the countrys $150 billion outsourcing sector.
				   
				Wipro on Wednesday said its dollar revenue declined 0.7% sequentially to $1.9 billion (0.6% rise in constant currency terms), after it had earlier outlined quarterly growth of at-best 2% in constant currency terms in the third quarter. Net profit declined 1% to $309 million from $312 million in the preceding quarter.A Bloomberg survey of analysts had estimated revenue of $2.01 billion (Rs13,678.7 crore) and profit of $308.23 million (Rs2,094.6 crore).Wipro expects between 1% and 2% revenue growth in constant currency terms in the January-March quarter. Chief executive officer Abidali Neemuchwala said it would take at least three-four quarters for the steps he has taken to bear fruit.Operationally, it was a good quarter. Our profitability improved in a quarter where there are furloughs and fewer working days. But I think in revenue growth we could have done more, Neemuchwala said. He added that the companys core business is doing well and that in three-four quarters it would return to industry-leading growth. Wipros weak numbers come after a tepid show by its peers. Infosys Ltd reported a 1.4% sequential drop in dollar revenue in the third quarter and cut its full-year revenue outlook for the third time while industry leader Tata Consultancy Services Ltd posted a 0.3% dollar revenue growth. Infosys now expects dollar revenue growth of at-best 7.6% this year (8-9% in constant currency terms). Wipro provides only a quarterly revenue growth outlook. Hearteningly for Wipro, the company managed to improve its operating margins by 50 basis points to 18.3%. However, two of the biggest challenges ahead for Wipro are to improve its ability to generate more business from existing clients and reviving organic growth. Wipros share of business from its top clients continues to slide. Even though Wipro managed to improve its quarterly revenue by 6.3% year-on-year, the share of the largest, top five and top 10 clients declined by 21.9%, 16.5%, and 14%, respectively.During the quarter, Wipro spent $8.7 million to buy Infoserver SA, a Brazilian company that offers solutions to banks and insurance companies. This is the fifth acquisition by Wipro in the last 20 months; it spent $1.13 billion in buying the other four companies, including cloud-services firm Appirio Inc. for $500 million. Apart from Appirio, which has $200 million in revenue, the three companies together have over $350 million in revenue, which translates into a growth of at-least 4% from the buyouts. Considering Wipro is expected to grow at-best 5% in the current year, this means the companys traditional business is hardly growing. Until the company can start recording good organic revenue growth, any talk of a turnaround is premature, said an analyst at a domestic brokerage who asked not to be identified. Wipros digital revenue improved to $413 million, a 10% sequential increase. In the quarter to December, Wipros business grew 0.7% in the US, which brings more than 55% of the total business, but declined 2.3% in Europe, which accounts for 23.6% of revenue.",2017-01-25,jCiaZDw7r0KIIPcIOKKEcI,"Wipros IT services revenue in the third quarter grew 3.5% to $1.90 billion from a year ago period, but the firm provided a weak outlook for the fourth quarter",17:39,Wipro revenue forecast underlines IT industrys challenges
0.48,"Mumbai: Shareholders of Tata Motors Ltd voted on a resolution on Thursday to remove Nusli Wadia as a director at the companys extraordinary general meeting (EGM).
				   
				Though the voting results were not released at the time of going to press, the odds seemed to be  stacked against the industrialist who has been a director on the Tata Motors board for more than 18 years, if the number of shareholders who spoke in favour of the resolution seeking his removal was any indication. Tata Sons, the Tata group holding company, in November sought the removal of Wadia as director of Tata Steel, Tata Motors and Tata Chemicals. Tata Sons controls 26.51% of Tata Motors, 29.75% of Tata Steel and 19.35% of Tata Chemicals.ALSO READ | Nusli Wadia removed as Tata Steel directorEarlier this month, Wadia filed a Rs3,000 crore defamation suit against Ratan Tata and the board of Tata Sons.Global proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (ISS) questioned the rationale behind resolution to seek removal of Wadia, an independent director at three Tata companies. Proxy advisory firm Stakeholder Empowerment Services (SES) on the other hand, recommended shareholders of Tata Steel, Tata Motors and Tata Chemicals to vote in favour of a resolution to remove him. Both developments happened earlier this month.Sixty-three people spoke at the EGM; most spoke in favour of the resolution.Before the meeting, Wadia, who did not attend the EGM, had made his case to the companys shareholders in a letter. Wadia said he had chosen not to attend, calling the recent EGMs as inappropriately and shamefully stage-managed.Wadia, 72, was removed as an independent director from the board of Tata Steel Ltd late on Wednesday with a majority of both institutional and retail investors voting against him at an EGM. On Friday, he will face a similar test at an EGM called by Tata Chemicals Ltd to remove him.Wadias four-page letter to Tata Motors shareholders, dated 21 December, spoke of attempts by Tata Sons to influence independent directors and the board of Tata Motors through unsigned legal opinions. These opinions, he said, were circulated just hours before a company board meeting to influence, intimidate and muzzle the independent directors from communicating with the stock exchanges.He wrote about the companys ill-conceived investments in low-cost passenger car Nano and the delay in its closure leading to a serious drain on the finances of the company. Wadia said every sale of Nano was at a substantial loss to Tata Motors, with total losses on Nano running into thousands of crores.Wadia also wrote about cross-holdings in Tata companies, the largest of which, he said, was Tata Sons valued at Rs8,600 crore.Wadia said the cross-holdings were being held in Tata Motors, a debt-ridden company, to keep voting control over Tata Sons. The listed companies as a whole have blocked approximately Rs70,000 crore in holding Tata Sons shares equivalent to 14% of its capital with the sole purpose of shoring up the voting rights of the (Tata) Trust(s).It is for you the shareholders of Tata Motors who own 70% of the shares of your company to decide whether you want to be the holder of Tata Sons shares with minimum return, zero liquidity and no exit, he wrote.Wadia said it was the first time in Tata Motors history that a productivity-linked settlement was agreed, initiated and was to be signed with the union in Pune after 14 months of discussion, but Ratan Tata met the union and asked them to support the change in leadership. The union subsequently issued a statement that their relationship with the management of the company had taken a downward trend over the issues. This irresponsible action galvanizing and acting prejudicially against the interest of your company may jeopardise its future and impact the overall morale of all the workers and employees of Tata Motors. The letter also pointed to the impact on the passenger vehicle business due to issues in design, product, quality, execution and high costs being directed from the top. The division has high capital employed, high level of loss that impacts overall financials of the company, he wrote. What is at stake now is not whether I am removed or not, but the fate of the very institution of the independent director that has been created in law and by Sebi (capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India) to safeguard the interests of all stakeholders, the letter said.On Wednesday, Wadia had said that the ability of promoter Tata Sons to seek removal of independent directors from group company boards could force them to either toe the line, resign or face removal.",2016-12-22,jFgUgkZQ86jpARNXaZ6grJ,"A number of shareholders, at the Tata Motors EGM, spoke in favour of the resolution seeking Nusli Wadias removal was any indication",11:29,Odds stacked against Nusli Wadia at Tata Motors EGM

In selecting group insider Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chief executive of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd since October 2009 and a TCS lifer, having joined the company straight after completing his Masters in Computer Applications from Regional Engineering College, Trichy, the committee has clearly decided to play safe this time around.

If Mistry was only the second non-Tata family member to head the $103 billion conglomerate, Chandrasekaran will be the first non-Parsi, pointing the way for the future of the community itself. Clearly, the gene pool of eligible Parsis to take over as corporate leaders has dwindled rapidly.Listed as an avid photographer, a passionate marathoner, and almost inevitably for a Tamil Brahmin as a music aficionado, Chandrasekaran at 53, has age on his side. He will also have the support of Ratan Tata who is unlikely to give him the kind of free hand he gave Mistry.

0.64,"Bangalore: Apple Inc. is willing to start making iPhones in India, but it wants a big helping hand from Narendra Modis government first.
				   
				The Cupertino, California-based company is scheduled to meet with officials in New Delhi next week to discuss the prospects for setting up manufacturing facilities in the country this year. Apple, the most valuable company on Earth, is asking for a long list of financial concessions from India, one of the poorest countries. Among the requests, the company is seeking a 15-year tax holiday on imports of components and equipment, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.We would like Apple to set up base in India, Ravi Shankar Prasad, minister for information technology said on Wednesday, without disclosing the companys negotiating stance.Apple wants to boost business in India as the country of 1.3 billion becomes the fastest-growing smartphone market and sales flatten in the US and China. Chief executive officer Tim Cook visited the country for the first time in May as he sought government approval for Apple to open its own stores. India has insisted that Apple, like any single-brand retailer, source 30% of its components locally, though the country is relaxing those rules so technology companies can operate stores for three years before meeting that requirement.Still, Apple wants more. The company has sent a list of requests ahead of its 25 January meeting with officials from several government departments, including Electronics and Commerce, the person said, asking not to be named because the matter is private. Apple is also asking for a waiver on customs duties for new and used equipment brought into India. The Indian Express newspaper reported Apple wants full exemption from duties on raw materials, components and capital equipment. Apple wont insist on getting everything on its wish list, the person said. Apple didnt respond to requests for comment.The company doesnt manufacture devices itself, but rather partners with contract manufacturers to handle the capital intensive demands of building factories and hiring staff. One surprise in India is that Apple plans to partner with Taiwans Wistron Corp. rather than Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., its usual manufacturing source, according to the person. Assembly of iPhones could start at Wistrons existing facility in the suburbs of Bengaluru, the person said. The work may be expanded to other suppliers including Hon Hai later, depending on demand, the person said.Apple and Indias officials have met several times amid a prolific exchange of correspondence, but next weeks meeting will be crucial. If the government gives in to Apples demands, it may have to offer similar incentives to other global brands, such as Samsung Electronics Co. and Xiaomi Corp.Historically, the government has given no such concessions to any other company and there is no room in the policy to do so, said Anshul Gupta, the Mumbai-based research director at Gartner Inc. What Apple is asking for is outside the trend so it will be interesting to see how the government looks at it.India isnt the only country pressing Apple for local manufacturing. US President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants to see iPhones made in Apples home market, part of a broader push to get companies to keep or create manufacturing jobs. Hon Hai has said that it is in preliminary discussions to broaden its investment in the US.Prime Minister Modi wants companies to make products in the country as part of his Make in India policy, aimed at reaping the benefits that come from manufacturing facilities and jobs. His administration doesnt want technology companies to sell products and take advantage of its vast consumer base without making their own capital investments.Despite its global success, Apple is a minor player in India, largely because its phones are too expensive for local consumers. Apple holds about 2 percent of the market in a country where about 500 million smartphones are expected to be sold in the next few years. Samsung Electronics Co. and local player Micromax Informatics Ltd. are the leaders, thanks largely to their low-cost devices. For Apple, setting up manufacturing and retailing facilities could make the devices cheaper and help fuel growth. Cook has said Apple is just scratching the surface in India.

0.63,"Singapore: Monday evenings coup at Bombay House, the headquarters of Indias steel-to-software conglomerate Tata, was as swift as it was abrupt.
				   
				Not only did the board of Tata Sons, the holding company, dump Cyrus Mistry as chairman after less than four years, it also brought back Ratan Tata, 78, as the interim boss, leaving nobody in any doubt that the founding family of the 148-year-old empire was reasserting control.But what made Tata reach for the nuclear option?The companys brief statement gave no clues, though conspiracy theories range from Mistrys futile attempts at micro-managing a maddening potpourri of companies, to not having a nose for talent (a six-member executive council put together by him was also disbanded), and selling the family silver to pay down debt when he should have focused more on growth.Investors in Tatas suite of operating companies were picking up signs of discord, but were still unprepared for a coup. After all, Ratan Tata seemed to be nothing less than delighted when a selection committee tasked to find his successor returned from a 15-month global hunt with the idea that Mistry  a member of the search panel as well as the son of a large shareholder  was the best choice. If the 48-year-old executive is now being removed for being out of his depth, the more experienced Ratan Tata deserves some blame for putting him in that position in the first place.Also Read: Understanding the Tata Sons boardroom coupBesides, its not clear that Mistry was doing a lousy job. Start the clock in late August 2004, when the IPO of software business Tata Consultancy created the group as it exists today. In the subsequent eight years that Tata guided the behemoth, a market capitalization-weighted index of its 26 listed units barely managed to beat the Sensex. Over a shorter time frame, Mistry has outperformed the benchmark more convincingly.When it comes to future returns, though, Ratan Tata may have reasons to be anxious about the direction in which Mistry was steering the ship.Tata took advantage of a China-fueled boom in commodity demand to load up on debt, which led to an eightfold expansion in the annual net income of the groups publicly traded companies in the six years through 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But with overcapacity in the Peoples Republic hitting the groups steel business hard, profitability waned.In wanting to reduce leverage by selling everything from money-losing UK steel operations to coal mines in Indonesia and hotels in the US, Mistry has veered too far away from his predecessors expansionist strategy. With the pace of capital expenditure down to a 12-month run rate of $2 billion versus $3.7 billion in Tatas final year at the helm, the group runs the risk of courting irrelevance. Also Read: Cyrus Mistry ouster could slow Tata groups debt reduction processMore worrisome, from a Tata perspective, is that the group nowadays makes news mostly for the wrong reasons. Whether its an almost $1 billion jury award against its software unit for a US intellectual-property infringement case, or the embarrassment of losing a $1.17 arbitration brought against Tata Sons by NTT Docomo for alleged failure to honour a partnership contract, the conglomerates reputation for good corporate citizenship has taken a beating.Its hard to say if Mondays putsch will fix everything from strategic wobbles to PR snafus. Investors will want to see if the mutiny leads to a bounty in the form of superior shareholder returns. That depends mainly on whether the search panel gets lucky this time around. Pending the induction of the new chairman, however, what matters is how operating companies  and their bosses  react to Ratan Tatas return.For now, palace intrigue looks unlikely to affect performance.

1.0,"The most fundamental progress that technology has made over the past few decades is a dramatic increase in computing power coupled with a reduction in the cost of storage. Such progress has enabled us to run algorithms and code over swathes of data and at a fraction of the cost, thus yielding what some may consider more insights. Consequently, we are able to find patterns in large amounts of data. 
				   
				This, by some limited definition, is construed as intelligence and has been demonstrated in specific classes of activities such as detecting diabetes from retinal scans, driving cars, playing games, etc. In these cases, software can emulate human behaviour and perhaps even exceed human capabilities. But the fact is that we have not yet invented any new magic wand to make software think on its own or have any sense of consciousness, in the way humans do.The limitation is grounded in the fact that software still operates, for the most part, on the paradigm of Gigo (garbage in garbage out), meaning it mostly only does whatever we tell it to and is biased, based on whatever data we train it with. Give it incorrect data and it will pick up incorrect patterns.But the vision and aspiration of computer science has always been to build a machine that can accurately emulate human intelligence. However, we still have a long way to go before we can build a software system that is functionally capable the same way a human is. Software intelligence, though defined in academic circles, has been fairly misused (and misunderstood) in popular reporting, giving people the impression that software can do just about anything a human being can. This notion is fundamentally misguided. We are not there. Or at least not yet. The gap between software and the human mind is still massive.Consequently such gaps do not necessarily support claims that artificial intelligence (AI) and automation will replace hordes of jobs in the Indian IT industry and ultimately lead to mass unemployment. This industry employs provides direct employment for a few million people in India, a significant fraction of whom belong to our expanding middle class. Therefore, as various commentators have begun to call out the threat of automation to this industry there is considerable (and reasonable) fear whether the rise of machines spells doom and gloom for a section of the Indian middle class.But I do not believe we are there yet. Or at least not to the extent people fear. Automating away this labour force is not an easy task. Terms like robotic automation are not sufficient replacement for the complexity and range of tasks that this labour force performs. It is very tempting to prognosticate a future where silicon (computers) will rule supreme over carbon (humans). However, as a computer scientist, through my work and study over the past few years in the IT/technology industry and about how businesses consume technology, I have gained a genuine appreciation for the unique value and contributions human beings bring to the table in building trust and enabling businesses the world over. Automating these unique attributes with machines will necessarily require emulating the same value humans deliver in businesses.The role of professionals in the IT industry, the populace whose work is under threat from automation, has not yet been sufficiently understood nor has it been given its due credit. These professionals perform a range of activities, from understanding customers business requirements to writing code, maintaining software systems and processing transactions. Working in teams, they perform a variety of different actions touching several information systems, coordinate with each other, navigate uncertain or changing scenarios, report to their managers, take bottomline responsibilities for their respective systems, are accountable and serve customers across the globe. All these activities engender a deep sense of trust and confidence among their customers the world over.But this is also true for each individual. All humans, I argue, even in the most seemingly robotic tasks bring to bear abilities that do not make them merely robotic. Conceptually every human being has a brain stack comprised of layers that include the ability to execute deterministic tasks, intuition, experience, handling (unexpected) variations, common sense, and an ability to identify and fix the unusual. These are fundamental traits that all humans share, though, admittedly, some more than others. No matter the task each human has the potential and ability to apply these traits in any situation without necessarily being to do so a priori. It is a combination of these traits inherent to each one of us that engenders trust and confidence in us among our colleagues. All businesses run on such trust and confidence in their stakeholders  be they employees or vendors. Therefore, attempting to replace any human with a robotic system is akin to trying to hire a human being who can only ever execute deterministic tasks but lacks intuition, common sense, experience, and an ability to handle unusual situations!Hence, any attempt by intelligent software at automating all that work done by a single individual or an entire team of humans must involve recreating the same trust and confidence. This, in-turn, necessarily requires addressing the whole gamut of these activities that humans perform on a regular basis and with similar human traits, but in software.Therefore, the next stage of innovation in computer science will be not just to make software run faster but also about how to get software to emulate more human-like traits and ultimately become truly trustworthy (like humans).Rohan Murty is junior fellow at the Society of Fellows at Harvard University.This is part of a series of articles in Mints 10th anniversary special issue that look at India 10 years from now.

0.25,"Seattle: Microsoft Corp. unveiled a corporate team-chat service that works with its cloud-based Office and Skype products, aiming to take on Slack Technologies Inc. and Atlassian Corp.s HipChat in a growing market.
				   
				The new product is designed to facilitate real-time conversations and collaboration while maintaining and building up that institutional knowledge of a team, said chief executive officer Satya Nadella. The product has team chat, private messages and voice and videoconferencing.Big companies like Microsoft and IBM are showing renewed interest in the corporate-messaging market as customers flock to internet-based tools like Slack for setting up team communications, said Vanessa Thompson, an analyst at IDC. Microsoft relied on Office 365 and other products to rack up almost $10 billion in commercial cloud revenue for the fiscal year that ended 30 June, and is adding services to draw in more customers.Microsoft is trying to get more airtime with customers that might want something to augment their existing investment in Office 365, Thompson said. What we have started to see is a bunch of companies trying to attack the enterprise versions of WhatsApp and consumer messaging. IDC hasnt published a market size or forecast for the space, which it calls workplace application messaging.A preview of the service, dubbed Microsoft Teams, is available now for Office 365 commercial customers in some versions. It will be generally available in the first quarter and will be included in all Office 365 Enterprise and small business versions.Coordinated tasksMicrosofts product allows teams to add what its calling Tabs, to quickly link to frequently used files and applications. These tabs can relate to Microsoft products like the OneNote note-taking program or to outside productsthe company said its adding support for Zendesk and Asana soon. Teams can also bring in notifications from services like Twitter and GitHub. Like Slack, it also supports the usage of botsprograms that chat with users to automate tasks.Its not Microsofts first foray into this areathe company paid $1.2 billion in 2012 to buy Yammer Inc., but hasnt been able to build up the same kind of usage as Slack and HipChat. Slack raised $200 million at a valuation of $3.8 billion in April. The startup, which introduced its product in 2013, said it reached annualized revenue of $100 million over the summer and surpassed 1.25 million paid users. HipChat was founded in 2010 and acquired by Atlassian two years later. That company declined to break out specific numbers for the product.Microsoft said Teams tight connection with Office and ability to do more than chat give it an advantage over rivals, some of which integrate with parts of Office, but not as closely.Just creating another persistent chat tool isnt all that interesting, said Office vice president Kirk Koenigsbauer. The notion of having this hub for teamwork is a new spin on it. Its not for people who just want to have conversations.Race dayNascar racing company Hendrick Motorsports has been trying out Teams and will use it on the track at the Daytona 500 in February, said Matt Cochran, the companys information technology manager. During a race, Hendrick will use Microsofts product to coordinate pit stops and share feedback among teams supporting its four cars. For example, if one car is seeing a certain kind of wear on tires its crew can alert the other three, which have similar equipment, to make adjustments. Chat is important because the crews need information quickly while audio channels of communications are reserved for conversations between the driver and the crew chief.Hendrick was using Slack, but will switch because Teams works more smoothly with the firms existing Microsoft software and has better security, Cochran said.Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft considered acquiring Slack, but the discussions never got serious enough to involve Nadella or the companys board, and it opted instead to build its own similar software, said two people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the process wasnt public. TechCrunch reported Microsofts potential interest in Slack in March.In a very tongue-in-cheek acknowledgment of the competition, Slack took out a full-page ad in the New York Times Wednesday and posted a copy on its website welcoming Microsoft to the field and noting that all this is harder than it looks.Atlassian president Jay Simons said HipChat has an advantage by focusing purely on communicating, while Microsoft Teams is another feature intended to sell Office 365 subscriptions.The success Atlassian has had in focusing on teams has probably been a wake-up call to Microsoft, he said. On one level, you welcome the competition but on the other level, Microsoft is always a little scary because its a huge company with a lot of customers.Bloomberg Beta, the venture capital arm of Bloomberg LP, is an investor in Slack.

				Infosys Ltd is expected by at least three brokerages to scale down its full-year dollar revenue growth for the third time this year when Indias second-largest software firm declares its third quarter results on Friday.This is not surprising, considering the negative cross currency impact and also partially, on account of managements inability to give a firm guidance. Still, 2015-16 is turning out to be roller-coaster ride for Infosys chief executive officer (CEO) Vishal Sikka. Till a year ago, Sikka seemed to have settled well and appeared to be enjoying his job (from playing cricket with employees in Mysuru to the after-results parties with senior management ranks).By December, Sikka came across as a different boss, unhappy with the progress made by the company, and heard telling his colleagues how he has been unable to implement things he had planned when he took over the current job in August 2014. In April last year, Infosys projected to grow at-best at 13.8%; now it will end the year in March with a less than 8% revenue expansion.Agreed, falling growth at Infosys mirrors the problems faced by the industry at-large: Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. scaled down its full-year growth on three times last year, and will grow at 9%. However, slow business from clients is just one area of concern. A bigger challenge is that, bit by bit, Infosys early turnaround plans put in place in January 2015, seem to be fizzling out. Retaining senior management is another headache for Sikka. Although overall attrition continues to be stable, five executive vice presidents (EVPs) left Infosys last year, compared to three EVP departures in the first 17 months of Sikkas tenure (1 August 201431 December 2015).Also read: Five things to watch for in TCS Q3 results tomorrowSikkas record to make the company future-ready, by having $2 billion from newer technologies and platforms, and another $1.5 billion from mergers and acquisitions and finally by improving its revenue per employee to $80,000 by March 2021, is patchy at best. This is not to pooh-pooh Sikkas efforts; he has tried his best till now. But Sikkas best seems to have not made a dent in an insular organisation like Infosys. How can Infosys embrace the new technologies if it shies away from acquisitions (Infosys has not made a single acquisition in the last 15 months)? During this time, Wipro Ltd spent over a $1 billion in buying companies. Most worrying is that despite Sikkaa repeated missives to employee to shape-up and embrace automation platforms in projects and learn newer skill sets, Infosyss revenue per employee refuses to improve. Finally, assuaging investor concerns, many of whom are now getting jumpy over some of the founders reported unhappiness with the CEO, is a big challenge. Despite Infosys estimated to grow faster than Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) in the current year, Infosys shares were down 8.4% as against a 7.7% decline in IT index last year. Infosys shareholders increased their wealth by 32.3% (as against a 14.21% return made in IT Index) in the period between 1 August 2014 and 31 December 2015.With this as the backdrop, Mint brings to you five things to watch out for when Infosys declares its earnings on Friday:Revenue forecast: Brokerage BNP Paribas sees Infosys recording a 1.5% sequential decline in dollar revenue (declining 0.5% in constant currency terms) at $2.55 billion for the October-December period. Management is further expected to narrow its full-year dollar revenue growth to less than 8%. This could set alarm bells ringing for investors as this suggests that Sikkas new measures to turnaround the company are taking longer than earlier expected.Senior management exits and steps management is taking to arrest attrition: A bigger headache for Sikka in this financial year is turning out to be the departure among senior management ranks. Exits of senior employees is leading to poor execution, a reason Sikka has conceded in the past behind companys underperformance.Where is the new in old Infosys? To Sikkas credit, Infosys over the last few years has hired people in the areas of artificial intelligence and pushed to embrace automation platforms. But the proof of the pudding is if indeed Infosys has been able to deploy some of these technologies to either improve its profitability or win business from newer companies which are acting as agents of disruption. Has Infosys won any business from companies like Uber or Airbnb or Facebook? It is over two years since Infosys first detailed its ambition of becoming a $20 billion firm by March 2021, and yet the management shies away from disclosing the progress made from monetising platforms.What is the challenge in translating business from large deal wins? Infosys under Sikka has significantly improved its large deal wins in a quarter ($809 million in April-June period and over $1 billion in the July-September period). For some unexplainable reason, this improved deal win is not translating into growth. Management clarity on this theme will be important.Infosys Consulting, BPO and Edgeverve continue to remain weak: Since August 2014, EdgeVerve and Infosys BPO units continue to underperform. Together, both accounted for a little over 13% of its $9.5 billion revenue last year. Infosys consulting was the third weak area at the beginning of this financial year.

				Chandra and I have done more than $4 billion in business in over a decade we have known (each other), Habib said days after Chandrasekaran, the chief executive officer (CEO) of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) was appointed chairman of Tata Sons Ltd.Put simply, over the years, Chandrasekaran got 66-year-old Habib to give TCS as much business as Indias fifth largest outsourcing company, Tech Mahindra Ltd, earned in revenue last year$4.04 billion.TCS ended last year with $16.5 billion in revenue.I remember once while I was COO (chief operating officer) at Nielsen, we had some trouble with two very important clients, P&G (Procter and Gamble Co.) and Kraft (Foods Group Inc.), said Habib, who now runs his own consulting firm, FCM. P&G believed that they did not need Nielsen as a provider because we were perceived to be not a technology leader. I had a discussion around this with Chandra, and he flew with our CEO and me to Cincinnati, to meet the CIO (chief information officer) of P&G. Chandra personally assured P&G and gave his personal commitment, under which he promised to have oversight, and provided TCSs resources to an industry-changing project. We retained P&G with his support and leadership. But had we lost P&G, it would have had a huge impact on us. So, this is the kind of commitment that underlines the importance Chandra gives to its (TCSs) customers.Chandrasekarans focus on building client engagement is one benchmark CEOs, including his successor Rajesh Gopinathan, will find impossible to match.Gopinathan, who is currently the chief financial officer, will take over as boss from 21 February. However, TCS executives believe that building client engagements will be the least of the worries for Gopinathan in the coming 12-24 months.Chandra will not let go of TCS. So, he will be there to mentor and help Gopinathan, said the first executive.Even by the outsourcing industrys penny-pinching ways, Gopinathan stands out.When most of TCSs rivals are seeing a drop in profitability, Gopinathan has managed to make TCS, with a 26% operating margin, the most profitable outsourcing company globally.Yet, Gopinathan takes over a very different TCS than the one Chandrasekaran inherited in 2009.At 45, Gopinathan is only a year younger than Chandrasekaran when the latter took over TCSs helm in 2009.TCS then was a 142,000-strong company, which had crossed $6 billion in revenue. Eight years later, in 2017, TCS is the countrys largest private-sector employer with over 378,000 employees. Managing a ship of this scale is not easy. Then TCS still had a lot of business to make from deploying engineers to write software codes and roll out ERP (enterprise resource planning software such as SAP), provide customer support, and maintain data centres for Fortune 1000 companies.Now, cloud-computing providers such as Amazon Web Services are eating into the business of TCS and other outsourcing companies. Automation and artificial intelligence technologies pose an existential threat to the way traditional outsourcing companies have done business.Finally, newer technologies such as block chain mean hundreds of thousands of engineers at TCS need to learn, build and offer solutions quickly to its clients.That Gopinathan will have his task cut out is an understatement. According to executives and analysts, how Gopinathan does on three challengesretaining talent, winning contract rebids, and executionin the two years should eventually decide the success of the decision to elevate him to the top at TCS.",2017-01-20,n24RlEmnPo7L7IMokUw7xN,"With cloud-computing providers, automation and artificial intelligence threatening the business of outsourcing companies, incoming CEO Gopinathan has his work cut out",01:30,The challenges ahead for TCS and new CEO Rajesh Gopinathan
0.57,"Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd beat analysts quarterly earnings estimates but expects to grow at best at 9.2% in the year ending 31 Marcha first in the history of Indias offshoring industry when the nations top three software companies expect annual growth to be in single digits.
				   
				Infosys cut its full-year dollar revenue forecast for the second time this fiscal, and now expects to grow between 8.2 and 9.2%, and 8-9% in constant currency terms.The sharp cut in FY17 USD revenue growth guidance, despite the recovery in growth momentum in 2QFY17, reflects a shift to a conservative approach on guidance after two successive cuts on the aggressive stance adopted at FY17-start, Pankaj Kapoor, director of India IT services and software equity research at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, wrote in a note. Chief executive officer Vishal Sikka said Infosys was scaling back its growth target because it had performed poorly in the first quarter and on account of near-term uncertainties.Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., which has most of its employees in India, has also cut its revenue growth forecast twice and expects to grow at 8.5-9.5% in 2016. Cognizant follows the calendar year. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Indias largest software services firm, does not give forecasts, but after it reported a poor 0.3% sequential dollar revenue growth on Thursday, it will be a tall task for the company to better the growth rate of 7.1% reported last fiscal year.Worryingly for both Infosys and TCS, it is not just sluggish revenue growth which is of concern. Both firms sounded less confident of maintaining profitability, with Infosys conceding that operating margin may be below its stated range of 25-26%.Infosyss sharp downward revision from the first growth outlook of between 11.8% and 13.8% dollar revenue expansion in April means that Infosys has shaved off $440 million in business from its first projection of adding $1.31 billion in incremental revenue this year. For Infosys, an at-best 9.2% growth means it expects to do $870 million in new business this year compared to $790 million last year.Infosys Ltd shares ended the day 2.53% lower at Rs1,025.70 on NSE even as the Nifty index rose 0.12% to 8,583.40 points.ALSO READ | Is Infosys being overly conservative with its guidance?Infosys said on Friday that revenue for the three months ended 30 September improved 3.5% to $2.58 billion from $2.5 billion in the preceding quarter. This was on account of the company partially recording $20 million in business from the Goods Services and Tax Network project, and a 4.5% growth in business from clients in banking and financial services segment.In constant currency terms, revenue grew 3.9% sequentially. Net profit rose 5.5% to $539 million from $511 million in the April-June period as the company deployed fewer people at expensive overseas client sites. A Bloomberg survey of analysts expected Infosys to report revenue of $2.58 billion and profit of $529.81 million in the September quarter.Operating margin expanded 80 basis points to 24.9% at the end of the September quarter, compared with 24.1% at the end of June. There are a couple of heartening takeaways in Infosyss performance during the second quarter, say analysts. First, a 4.6% sequential increase in business from banking clients suggests that Infosys may be winning customers at the expense of other large technology vendors.Second, Infosys reported over $1.2 billion in large deal wins during this quarter. This means that in little less than 18 months, Infosys has managed to increase its large deal wins from a little over $400 million a quarter to $1.2 billion.Analysts at Citibank said in a note after Infosys declared its earnings that fairly all-round growth in key geographies and verticalsbetter than what peer TCS reported is another positive for the company. The US business, which brings 61.5% of Infosyss revenue, improved 2.6% sequentially, while business from India, which accounts for 3.4% of overall revenue, jumped 29.1%.The company added 78 new clients in the second quarter, taking the total number of customers to 1,136.

-0.17,"Mumbai: Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has pared its holdings in Tata group firms, fearing that a potentially long legal battle between Tata Sons Ltd and its ousted chairman Cyrus P. Mistry will erode its investments. 
				   
				Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and mutual funds have been more optimistic, with the latter increasing their ownership in 12 Tata group firms and cutting their stake in seven. In the December quarter, state-run LIC, Indias biggest investor, cut its stakes in seven out of the 11 Tata group firms it owns stakes in, according to stock exchange data. Twenty-seven Tata group firms are listed. FPIs slashed holdings in nine and increased their holdings in nine Tata group firms. LIC cut its stake by the most in Tata Chemicals Ltd, where it reduced its holding by 73 basis points (bps) to 2.59%. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. In Tata Global Beverages Ltd, it slashed its holdings by 60 bps and by 35 bps in Tata Communications Ltd. Titan Co. Ltd and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd are the only Tata group firms in which LIC increased its stakes during this period.Overall, the value of LICs holdings in listed Tata firms came down by Rs2,371 crore or 6.4% between 24 October, when the Tata Sons board suddenly ousted Mistry, and the end of December. In comparison, the entire market capitalization of Tata listed firm fell by 7.6%.  A lot of things that were kept under wraps have come to the fore after the Tata-Mistry dispute started. So, from an FPI point of view, especially when US markets have started looking up, there is not much reason for them to stay heavily invested in Tata firms for the time being, said the head of a mid-sized asset management firm, requesting anonymity. FPIs too slashed their holdings in Tata group firms such as Tata Elxsi Ltd (3.2 percentage points) and 1.9 percentage point in Tata Motors. On the flip side, foreign investors also raised their stakes in 9 firms, including Trent Ltd by 2.66 percentage points and Indian Hotels Co. Ltd (54 bps). However, given the overall decline in prices of Tata group firmsa trend mirroring the broader marketthe value of FPI holdings in Tata firms fell by 10.9%, or Rs18,131 crore, between 24 October putsch and the end of December. In the three months to December, FPIs sold $6.72 billion worth of shares.LIC is looking to slash its holdings in Tata group firms further gradually over concerns that the ongoing Tata-Mistry feud may continue for several years, diminishing returns on investments, according to two people familiar with LICs investment strategies, including an LIC official. They did not want to be named because the matter is market-sensitive. The Tata-Mistry spat has reached the doors of the National Company Law Tribunal and hearings are on from Tuesday. An email sent to LIC remained unanswered. No one knows how long this will continue and how much damage it will inflict on investments (made) by shareholders. LICs priority has always been its policyholders, said one of the two persons cited above. LIC is the countrys largest insurer with total assets of around Rs21 trillion. Mutual funds in India have, however, chosen to increase their holdings in most Tata group firms, in contrarian bets. They hold stakes in 24 listed Tata group firms, of which 12 saw an increase in MF holdings in the December quarter. During October-December, MFs increased their holding by 2.47 percentage points in Tata Steel. They reduced their stakes in seven Tata firms and the overall value of their holdings fell by 4.6%.  Tata group firms have created a strong brand and these companies are capable of delivering value over a period of time.

0.17,"Tata Sons Ltd has removed Cyrus P. Mistry as chairman of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and sought to replace him as a director of the software services provider as the fight between the holding company and its former chairman (and significant shareholder) enters a new phase.
				   
				Tata Sons, which has a 73.26% stake in TCS, nominated Ishaat Hussain, a Tata group veteran, as the interim chairman of the company with immediate effect. Thus, Mistry ceases to be chairman of the TCS board, the company said in a stock exchange statement on Thursday.Separately, Tata Sons has requested a shareholder meeting of Indian Hotels Co. Ltd (IHCL) to pass a resolution for the removal of Mistry as director. On 4 November, IHCLs independent directors unanimously backed Mistrys board position as chairman.This could mark the beginning of a protracted battle,  analysts said.Also read: Did Tata Sons violate insider trading norms?According to the articles of association of TCS, as long as Tata Sons (and associates) holds at least 26% of the firm, the holding company has the right to nominate the chairman of the board of directors.People close to Mistry have questioned TCSs move, saying that Tata Sons has the right to only nominate a candidate.TCS had to then convene a board meeting and table the nomination at the board at a meeting or through a circular resolution. Nothing of this nature was done. In pre-meditated haste, by a letter of the same date, TCS has directly gone on to announce that Mistry stands replaced, one of the people said.A TCS spokesperson said the due process was followed. Under Article 90 of the articles of association of the company, the majority shareholders of Tata Sons are vested with the power to nominate the chairman. Accordingly, it informed all the board directors that Hussain is being nominated as the chairman, the spokesperson said. Sumit Agrawal, partner, Suvan Law Advisors, said that under the Companies Act, where articles of association specifically and categorically provide a right to a major shareholder or group of shareholder to nominate a chairman, exercising that right effectively removes the incumbent with immediate effect till a regular appointment of someone else through a shareholder resolution is made.The concept of shareholders right in the modern corporate world denotes the shareholders supremacy in the governance of the business and the affairs of the corporate sector either directly or through their elected representatives, said Agrawal.These shareholders, he pointed out, have certain statutory rights which nobody can take away, except in accordance with prescribed norms under articles and provisions of the Companies Act.That said, the process followed in TCS to nominate a new chairman neednt necessarily be followed in other group companies. Thats because the method of appointment or removal of chairman is incorporated in the articles of association of a company. In Tata Motors, for instance, the right to appoint the chairman lies with the board and not Tata Sons.Also read: Is trust deficit widening on Tatas narrative on Cyrus Mistry?For removing Mistry as a director, shareholder approval is needed and the request for an extraordinary general meeting in TCS by Tata Sons points to that.Under the provisions of the Companies Act, anyone holding at least 10% of a company can call for a shareholders meeting and propose a special resolution to remove directors before the end of their tenure.Amit Tandon, founder and managing director of Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS), a proxy advisory firm, said that the latest move marks the beginning of Tata Sons moving shareholder resolutions to remove Mistry from the board of operating companies.In the case of TCS, as they have more than 70% stake, they are quite confident of pulling it through, he said.In other Tata group operating companies where Mistry is chairman, Tata Sons (plus other group companies that have cross-holdings) owns a 30-35% stake.In Tata Chemicals, whose board met on Thursday, it has only a 29.98% ownership.To pass a resolution supporting the removal of Mistry as director, the Tatas will need a 51% majority. Thus, the role of institutional shareholders, particularly Life Insurance Corp. of India, becomes important.The state-owned insurer holds around 13% each in Tata Steel Ltd and Tata Power, and 10% in Tata Global Beverages Ltd.The vote of institutional investors will be decisive. Perhaps, this is a reason why Tata Sons has come out with a detailed statement today explaining its need to replace Mr. Mistry and also rejecting claims made by him in his letter to the Board of Tata Sons, said a statement by InGovern Research Services Pvt. Ltd.Hussains nomination comes on the heels of a snub the promoters faced on 4 November when independent directors unanimously backed Mistrys board position at Indian Hotels, which owns the Taj group.

				There are only about 58,000 Parsis in India, a nation of 1.2 billion people. Yet, the community has included some of Indias biggest business names, its top nuclear scientists, world-class musicians and several senior military officers including the countrys first field-marshal.Parsis are also known for maintaining their privacy.They should have settled this between themselves instead of what has happened so publicly, said a Parsi woman stepping out of the communitys fire temple in downtown Mumbai.Also read: Tata, Cyrus Mistry put PR teams in place, facing a long battle aheadThe row between Ratan Tata, family patriarch of the sprawling $100 billion salt-to-steel Tata Sons empire, and Cyrus Mistry, a scion of the billionaire Shapoorji Pallonji clan, erupted in public last week. Both families are pillars of the Parsi community, comprised of descendants of Persians who first landed in India in the ninth century.Tata Sons announced on 24 October that Mistry had been removed as chairman of the company. Sources close to the company said Mistrys corporate strategy was seen as transgressing the core Parsi value of working for the greater common good.A five-page email response from Mistry to the Tata board was leaked two days later, containing scathing criticism of the companys corporate governance practices and Ratan Tatas role in some of the companys costliest errors. The two sides have traded barbs on a near-daily basis since then.Also read: Tata listed firms reply to NSE clarifying on Cyrus Mistrys emailWhile business spats are not uncommon in Indias financial capital Mumbai, the public allegations of malfeasance and the central role of two billionaire Parsis has not gone down well in the community.I would say Cyrus, walk out with a little dignity and self respect. Dont wash dirty linen in public. Dont make the press your playground. Fight battles inside boardrooms, said Rumi Behram Balsara, a second-generation shareholder in some Tata group companies.Tata ethosFrom shipyards to textiles, Mumbais Parsis have led the citys commercial development from a group of sleepy fishing villages to one of Asias business capitals.Parsi business houses owned by the Tata, Wadia and Godrej families are at the forefront of Indias corporate world. The Tata empire stretches from Jaguar Land Rover to Tetley Tea, while the Wadia family owns textile and food-product businesses. The Godrej Group owns interests in everything from consumer goods to chemicals.Also read: The fig leaf of corporate governanceParsis follow the Zoroastrian faith, an ancient pre-Islamic religion of Iran. Some of the tenets of the faith like charity and doing good to others have long been woven into the Tata heritage and business ethos. Much of the dividend paid out by Tata Sons gets funnelled into charitable trusts involved in philanthropic work.The crux of the Tata world view, said Morgen Witzel, a UK-based author of a book on the Tata company, is shareholder value should not be an end in itself. Companies are not machines for making money. They exist to provide value and service to their communities; profit is a by-product of that process.That view appears to be at the heart of the boardroom dust-up. Mistry was attempting to gradually transform Tata from a sprawling empire of middling businesses into a much more focused profit-driven enterprise, but that involved decisions like axing businesses and jobs, moves that jarred with the Tata ethos, say sources close to the conglomerate.Over time, the Tatas had built up a fantastic reputation. However, the size and resistance to change meant that many of their businesses were not able to keep up with the times, said Ronny Bharda, a Mumbai-based Parsi businessman. Cyrus Mistry brought about a renewed sense of enthusiasm. He had the ability to bring about change.Eventually, what social good can the house of Tatas do, if they do not earn any money?More than businessSome Parsis believe the community should ignore the spat.The Parsi community isnt the custodian of thoughts, words and deeds of every Parsi, said Baghzaad Bhomisha, a Mumbai-born Parsi settled in Australia, adding Parsis had bigger concerns than the egos and worthless legacies of Parsi billionaires.Mistry, an Irish citizen, was the first chairman in the Tata groups 148-year history to not belong to the Tata family. He was named chair of the group in 2011 after a lengthy search for a replacement for Ratan Tata. In an organization populated by veterans, his anointment at the age of 43 was a marked departure for the Tatas.Mistrys family is also prominent and has long had ties with the Tatas. His elder brother Shapoor runs the Shapoorji Pallonji conglomerate, which is focused on construction and real estate. It also owns the largest individual stake in Tata Sons, after the family trusts headed by Ratan Tata.The two families are related by marriageCyrus Mistrys sister is married to Ratan Tatas half-brother Noel.Mistrys ouster shows a person with a keen business sense only wont work. Tata is built on more than just business, said Kaizad Todywalla, a Parsi who owns a coin auction house in Mumbai.I personally believe you need a Tata to make sure that the ethos of the group or the philosophy behind it remains. Reuters",2016-11-01,oRoGbj4ivMXhf5SHo5yaqI,"The public allegations of malfeasance and the central role of two billionaire Parsis , Rata Tat a and Cyrus Mistry has not gone down well in the communit",12:31,Tata vs Mistry shocks Parsi community

				The entire episode is a classic home ground for myriad litigation, said Sumit Agrawal, partner at law firm Suvan Law Advisors and a former official with markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).There could also be a class action suit, suit for damages, defamation as well as a public interest litigation, said Agrawal.ALSO READ | Cyrus Mistry fires first salvo in legal battle against TataThe fight in the courts could very well start with questioning Mistrys unceremonious removal as chairman of Tata Sons. According to the holding firms articles of association, a selection committee is needed to both select and replace a chairman. However, the Tatas have said they had sought legal opinion before replacing him, and it isnt clear why Mistry has not pursued this option so far.If relevant, the breach of any contractual shareholder rights may also be alleged in terms of the shareholders agreement at the Tata Sons level. Whether the parties approach arbitration or the courts will also be dependent upon the terms of the said agreement, said Tejesh Chitlangi, partner at law firm IC Legal.Pursuing the corporate governance angle, Mistry could complain to Sebi about these issues, especially the possible violation of the need-to-know principle under securities regulations.Many of allegations in the public domain against Tata Sons pertain to financial irregularities and insider trading for which Mistry can approach CBI, Sebi. According to his statements, the end goal is to achieve better governance practices, so such investigations could lead to short term pain; however, down the line, there would be cleaner processes, said Shriram Subramanian, founder of proxy advisory firm, InGovern.Yet another option is to approach the government. At the heart of the governance reform,  which Mistry wants to institute, lies the relationship of the Tata Trusts with the group operating companies. He has said the government has an inherent obligation to remedy and repair (the) breakdown in the governance of Tata Trusts.In his Monday message, Mistry talked about how the trustees wielded no voting power on Tata Sons shares until 15 years ago, because company law had vested it in the hands of the government.The role of MCA (ministry of corporate affairs) in administering The Companies Act, 2013, and of the ministry of finance in seeking the stand of Sebi and stock exchanges is also involved, since the episode has international ramifications of Indias rankings for business environment, Agrawal of Suvan added.Mistry could present these issues of corporate governance and ethics to institutional investors and ask them to raise questions with the Tatas.We have brought the dialogue on the table, both from the point of view of governance and ethics, and I think that is today in peoples minds. I believe you will see shareholders in the near future demanding (better) governance, Mistry said in an interview on Monday.I also think that the institutional investors should write to Tata Sons seeking that what is their succession plan, because from where we stand, it seems to be completely unclear, said Subramanian of InGovern.Lastly, Mistry and his family can buy shares of the Tata group operating companies from the open market, if he thinks that will best serve his interests as a shareholder in the group. The Shapoorji Pallonji group has little more than 18% in Tata Sons and very small stakes in at least one group operating company.",2016-12-20,obL4ErMKvswqO7WvCSMyjI,"For Cyrus Mistry, the company law tribunal case may be just the beginning in the battle with Tata Sons",10:15,The options before Cyrus Mistry
0.15,"According to balance of payments data released by the central bank, gross inflows from computer services stood at $18.24 billion in the April-June quarter this year. 
				   
				Whats striking about the data is that this represents a year-on-year growth of just 0.3%, suggesting growth in inflows from IT have practically dried up. As the chart alongside shows, growth has come off substantially compared to pre-crisis levels, when growth rates averaged over 30%.But it must be noted that the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBIs) data shows FY16 gross inflows from computer services of around $74 billion, while Nasscom puts the industrys revenues at $108 billion in the year till March 2016. Besides, while Nasscom estimated FY16 growth at 10.3% in dollar terms, RBI data puts growth in inflows at merely 1.4%. Growth in gross inflows, of course, need not be the same as growth in IT sector export revenues.Having said that, its true that growth rates of IT exports have come down substantially, as is evidenced in the September quarter results of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd. Indias IT industry is set to grow in single digits this fiscal year, its weakest performance since the global financial crisis. Based on TCS and Infosyss comments, growth is likely to be in the 7-8% range. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a recent note to clients, At present, Indian IT Industry faces three broad headwinds: (1) weak IT spends in financial services and healthcare verticals coupled with rise in insourcing or expansion of captives by select financial services clients, (2) deflationary impact of automation on revenue. Automation savings built in large deals/renewals puts downward pressure on revenues; downward pressure on contract values has been an ongoing pattern but has accelerated in the past 12-18 months, and (3) lack of adequate participation in digital.

-0.3,"The December quarter results of Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T), a proxy for the state of Indias investment demand, was disappointing. It was all the more so, as it had turned in a vibrant performance for the September quarter. What is likely to dampen investor sentiment is the managements decision to lower growth guidance to 8-10% for the full year ending March, from the earlier forecast of 12-15%. And even that appears to be an uphill task for the juggernaut.
				   
				The firms December quarter results surprised the Street negatively. Net revenue grew 1.4% to Rs26,287 crore from a year ago, which fell short of Bloombergs average estimate by a significant 11%. One could blame it on demonetisation, to some extent.The impact was felt the most in the infrastructure segment, which comprises over three-fourths of L&Ts revenue. The management said in its media release that clearance delays and the abrupt liquidity crunch at the customers end hindered work progress.Meanwhile, toll revenue was down, too. So were real estate sales. Yet, the segments revenue grew by 6%, with a robust contribution from its international projects.Thats not all. L&Ts power segment is battling a dwindling order book. Revenue fell by 23% year-on-year (y-o-y). Also, the other smaller engineering segments and information technology (IT) did little to enthuse investors.But L&Ts 9.6% operating margin matched investor expectation and was a neat 140 basis points (bps) higher than the year-ago period. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Stringent working capital management and cost-cutting exercises did the trick. In this respect, the infrastructure segment delivered a respectable 110 bps y-o-y rise, even as the hydrocarbons, heavy engineering and electrical and automation segments pulled up their socks.However, both operating profit and net profit fell short of the average brokerage estimates. Yet, the consolidated net profit was about 39% higher y-o-y at Rs972.5 crore, not a bad deal considering the macroeconomic challenges.The moot question is, will L&T meet its guided revenue and order inflow target?On the revenue front, the firm will have to ramp up execution in the fourth quarter to match even the watered down 10% growth in annual revenue. Thanks to customer delays after the currency ban, the work at many sites was almost at a standstill. These have to gain traction again. Meanwhile, segments such as IT could clock slower revenue growth.On order inflows, the challenge is no less. December-quarter order inflow was 10% lower, with a third coming in from overseas. Again, given its run-rate at the end of nine months, the firm has to clock at least Rs50-60,000 crore to meet the guided annual target. Not impossible, given that the fourth quarter is the lumpiest on order inflows, but a Herculean task, too.In fact, L&Ts results convey that all is not well in the economy.Domestic growth appears to take a longer time as investment momentum is weak and the banking system is burdened with a debt overhang, says the company's media release, adding that the challenging business conditions are likely to remain for a few more quarters.Infrastructure orders from the government are still delayed and private capex is yet to take off.L&Ts stock trades at Rs1,439 apiece, which discounts its one-year forward estimated earnings by a rich 21 times.In fact, since demonetisation, the stock, which has been a steady outperformer, has been volatile. Brokerages have trimmed both the expected earnings and valuations over the past few weeks. Only a fillip to revenue or order inflows can make this elephant dance.",2017-01-30,owEALNgutsPaC3fb7D6X4O,"What is likely to dampen investor sentiment is the managements decision to lower growth guidance to 8-10% for the year to March, from the earlier forecast of 12-15%",07:38,L&T results mirror the poor state of investment demand
0.58,"Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw is the chairperson and managing director at Biocon Ltd, a biotechnology firm. Named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time magazine in 2010, Mazumdar-Shaw is recognized as much for her entrepreneurial expertise as she is for her philanthropy. This year, she became the second Indian to take the Giving Pledge, which encourages billionaires to give away their wealth for social good. In an interview conducted by Bridgespan in partnership with Mint, she explains that her philanthropic efforts are focused on healthcare, and makes a distinction between charity and philanthropy.  Edited excerpts: 
What motivated you to start your philanthropic journey and where did you go for advice?I belong to the breed of first-generation entrepreneurs who have basically created our enterprises with very frugal resources. Being in a field like healthcare, for me as someone who is basically on a mission to make a global impact in terms of affordable access to healthcare, I am very, very concerned about the fact that there are a large number of people in this world who need to have some access to basic rights, whether it is in education or healthcare. This is a huge global challenge which I think every one of us who has been fortunate enough to create the kind of wealth we have created, needs to do something about.Inherently I have a social conscience which my late father inculcated in me. He was not exactly a very wealthy man but he was very concerned about the underprivileged, about the people who didnt have equal opportunities.Can you talk about your portfolio of philanthropic works? You mentioned you work in cancer, and initiated work in diabetes.My philanthropy is largely focused on healthcare and I really want to make a difference to peoples lives. The poor are absolutely neglected and they are abused in many ways, because the system just totally ignores their needs, so I have also sort of allocated some part of my philanthropy funds to primary healthcare. In primary healthcare again, I want to use technology in a big way, because I feel that we have got to leapfrog if we have to make any difference to society. I have helped to create what are called ilaaj (diagnosis) clinics and we use technology to diagnose early so that you can treat early and the outcomes become better.These are experimental times but for me philanthropy is about catalyzing a process. It is not about doing the governments job, which very often the government believes is what philanthropy is. I dont ascribe to that at all. I believe that in philanthropy, there are certain things where you can make a big difference like you know building hospitals where you can actually deliver affordable healthcare. I think the government needs to partner with philanthropists and with corporate social responsibility to experiment with new ideas, and that is a form of philanthropy that can really transform.For you, what has translated from your for-profit experience into your philanthropy?Philanthropy has to be sustainable, and thats why I will make a big distinction between charity and philanthropy. Charity has generally a sort of temporary effect and is about giving fish to a hungry man rather than teaching a person how to fish. Philanthropy changes somebody elses life in a meaningful way.How is new philanthropy different from traditional philanthropy?I think old wealth understands philanthropy and they do have a lot of philanthropic programmes to show for it, like in the case of the Birlas or Tatas. They do have a lot to show in terms of philanthropic outcomes; they have created educational institutes, hospitals and other kind of institutions. New wealth takes time to understand what philanthropy is about, because when you create new wealth, your first immediate reaction is I got to make sure that I keep that wealth for a rainy day.What can be done to stimulate philanthropy in India?Philanthropy is about setting an example and I think many of us first-generation entrepreneurs who have built very successful businesses have come together under the India Philanthropy Initiative (IPI) that Mr (Azim) Premji started. Ratan Tata was also one of the co-conspirators. I would say that many of us who belong to IPI, like Nandan and Rohini Nilekani, are like-minded people when it comes to philanthropy. We all believe that every generation has to create new wealth and the wealth that you have created, a large part of it must go back into making the society better, to make a difference to the ones who have been wronged in the society. Every one of us who has created this kind of wealth in India in recent times has demonstrated a social conscience, whether it is Infosys or Wipro, or Biocon.What advice do you give to the new philanthropists who are early in their journey?I always tell people to ask themselves: where do you think you can make a difference and why do you want to make that difference. New philanthropists tend to feel overwhelmed by the needs of society. How do you decide to focus on certain things and say no to other things?Its not just about being a new philanthropist. Even seasoned philanthropists get absolutely bombarded by requests. Everyone comes with great ideas and how wonderful their initiative is and why you should be helping them. As a philanthropist, you have to be very clear on what you are trying to do. If something that is being done actually aligns with what you are doing, then it is very clear that you can actually help this person. But more often most requests dont quite align with what you are trying to do, so it is very easy to say no. Personally I back ideas where I know that the person is very passionately involved with that initiative because again it is about sustainability. Youve got to have ownership of what you are doing.What can strengthen Indian philanthropy?I believe that investing in incubators and accelerators through an angel investment is also extremely important, provided that you are not looking for a return on that investment and are prepared to reinvest whatever returns you make on such investments. To me as a first-generation entrepreneur I know how tough it is to build a business and to scale it up, so I think philanthropic funds should also help others to build social businesses.What are the things that you do to be able to delegate in your philanthropy?You do need to make sure that you build a philanthropic organization or an administrative cell that really looks at your philanthropy very objectively. In most of my kind of philanthropic initiatives, I have really invested in such a way that I leave it to the investees to really take my philanthropy forward. For instance, at the hospital project, I just leave it to the administration of the hospital to make sure that they leverage what I have given them into a very big opportunity.ALSO READ | Govt policy should make it easier to give: Rohini NilekaniALSO READ | You really want to be doing things that make a difference: Ratan TataThe Bridgespan Group, an adviser and resource for mission-driven leaders and organizations, in partnership with Mint interviewed several philanthropists across India to trace their journeys and share their learningsConversations with Remarkable Givers: India.

The algorithm diagnoses the condition with over 90% accuracy by analysing retinal fundus photographs and will probably eliminate the need for an ophthalmologist at the diagnosis stage. Strangely, nobody, including its creator, knows what exactly the algorithm is looking for in the photographs as the algorithm has trained itself rather than being told what and where to look. 
				   
				Our world is being shaped by the intersection of multiple emerging as well as some entirely new technologies. Self-driving cars, drones and intelligent homes are already accepted as inevitable. In other industries, we might witness a shift to consumerization in energy, i.e. the way that energy is produced and distributed, relying heavily on naturally available sources, new storage methods and intelligent grids. We will see the dawn of an entirely new way of commerce, of transparency and efficiency enabled by technology. One doesnt have to look hard to find examples which show that technology is becoming core and inseparable from innovation in every industry. Artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, the Internet of Things, blockchain and many game-changing technologies are coming of age. At the same time, digital is becoming the de facto approach to buying products, services and experiences. The fast-moving landscape on both sides of demand and supply will make most 10-year predictions seem tame in hindsight.Thanks to its unique vantage point over the last three decades, the Indian IT industry has an opportunity to shape these global forces. It has earned its stripes based on the seemingly unassailable value proposition of cost, scale and quality. It has been successful in constantly reinventing service excellence across a broad range of technology, business processes and engineering services. However, this may no longer be enough. To win in the next decade, the industry may need, in some sense, to be an antithesis of the past. Past winning factors of cost, scale and predictability will need to pivot to value-based, agile and innovative, i.e. be true digital co-partners, while helping customers ruthlessly drive efficiencies in their operations. Innovation in AI and robotic process automation platforms and technologies will play a critical role in helping achieve almost unimaginable levels of automation. Winning in the new paradigm thus implies the need for a significant shift in capabilities, skill sets, delivery models and new relationships/partnerships. Capabilities are shifting from technology based to business solution oriented, skills from generalists to specialists with a broad range of expertise, delivery models from off-shore to agile and as a service based, and stakeholders are shifting from calling only on the chief information officer (CIO) to business, functional and IT. Workforce transformation through upskilling and multi-skilling will be essential in the new landscape. Working in cross-function agile teams, imbibing and practising design thinking will need to become second nature to a large majority of technology workers who have traditionally focused on narrow technical excellence.Developing leading-edge capabilities will require an almost boundary-less approach to developing IP (intellectual property) and solutions through an effective external ecosystema combination of investment and participation in innovation ecosystems such as start-ups, academia and venture capital ecosystems. While thats a lot of change to deal with in a short time frame, it is also an opportunity to create value on a much larger scale. India has a large and growing market for digital products and services and a start-up landscape. Government-led initiatives like Digital India can be real catalysts for the change, providing the impetus to leapfrog in innovation ahead of other, slower- growing economies.It will take a sense of purpose, a pioneering spirit and a start-up culture to realize this vision. At a time when globalization is facing some scepticism and headwinds, the industry can be a beacon of hope, showing the power of ideas, innovation and technology to create economic and social value across borders and without bias. The opportunity is ours to win.Rishad Premji is chief strategy officer and member of the board at Wipro LtdThis is part of a series of articles in Mints 10th anniversary special issue that look at India 10 years from now.

				Chandrasekaran was named chairman of Tata Sons on Thursday.Mumbai-based TCS also appointed N.G. Subramaniam as the new chief operating officer, thereby creating the CEO-COO model after seven years. Chandrasekaran was COO before becoming CEO in 2009.

Rajesh is a very meticulous and articulate guy. Above all, Chandra trusts him completely and so will rely on him to execute his vision, said one executive. I dont see Chandra letting go at TCS and hell still work closely with Rajesh, this person, who asked not to be identified, added. Once he takes over as Tata Sons chairman, Chandrasekaran is also expected to take over as chairman of TCS.Gopinathan, 46, was handpicked by Chandrasekaran when he joined TCS from Tata Industries in 2001.

0.34,"Mumbai: Dell Technologies chairman and chief executive officer Michael Dell is determined to change the common perception of his companythat its a traditional maker of low-margin products like personal computers, servers and storage systems.
				   
				The view changed little even after Dell said in October 2015 that it will buy EMC Corp. Now that the merger of the two companies is complete, Dells strategy to alter this view is revolving around quickly rolling out new infrastructure products that have been jointly developed by Dell and EMC teams, cross-selling them to clients of both, strengthening existing partnerships with firms like SAP AG, Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp., and forging new ones even with competitors like Amazon Web Services Inc.Dell executives say they are best suited to help clients go digital with the combined entitys broad technology portfolio, which not only comprises computing products but also services and solutions in the areas of hybrid cloud, software-defined data centres and converged- and hyper-converged infrastructure (integration managed by software), platform-as-a-service, data analytics, mobility and cybersecurity.This multipronged strategy was evident when Dell took the stage at the first-ever Dell-EMC World 2016 event in Austin, Texas, on 18 October, and gave an impassioned speech that had all the trappings of a successful road map for next-gen computing.Beginning with a reiteration of the Go Big or Go Home, Baby! slogan delivered at last years Dell event, he peppered this years speech with technology buzzwords like digital, the Internet of things (IoT), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI).Alluding to Dells Digital Transformation Index , Dell underscored the presence of a digital fear among the 4,000 business leaders across 16 countries and 12 industries that were surveyed as part of a recent report. His pitch: This (digital) future is coming very rapidly and the future does not care whether you are ready. But we do... (We are) the trusted provider of essential infrastructure for the next industrial revolution.Dell evidently believes in economies of scale, made evident by his Go Big slogan. The Dell-EMC merger, announced last October, was the largest deal in tech history, topping Avago Technologies Ltds $37 billion purchase of Broadcom Corp.Dell Technologies is now a $74 billion company that comprises a PC business and affiliated businesses including virtualization (the partitioning of a physical server into smaller virtual servers in a bid to reduce costs) company VMware Inc., security firms RSA Security Llc and SecureWorks Inc., software and services (including cloud and Big Data analytics) company Pivotal Software Inc., and cloud management software firm Virtustream Inc. Dells eponymous combined business now comprises two segmentsDell EMC is the sub-brand for the companys enterprise business, including products and solutions, and Dell is the sub-brand for the companys client solutions for consumers, business and institutional customers.Dell plans to go about the task of ramping up business growth also by touting that the combined company stands as a market leader in many of the most important and high-growth areas of the information technology (IT) market, including positions as the Leader in 20 Gartner Magic Quadrants and a portfolio of more than 20,000 patents and applications.Does the pecking order bear out Dells claim?To be sure, the worldwide IT spending figure augurs well for technology companies like Dell Technologies, which figures in the top three in PCs, servers and storage.Overall IT spending is forecast to reach $3.5 trillion in 2017, up 2.9% from estimated spending of $3.4 trillion this year, according to Gartner Inc. According to the research firm, software and IT services segments have been the bright spots. Software spending is projected to grow 6% in 2016 and another 7.2% in 2017 to total $357 billion, while IT services spending is forecast to grow 3.9% in 2016 to $900 billion and 4.8% in 2017 to $943 billion.ALSO READ | Dell Technologiess road map for IndiaThe total worldwide enterprise storage systems factory revenue remained flat year-on-year at $8.8 billion during the second quarter of 2016, according to research firm International Data Corporations (IDCs) Worldwide Quarterly Enterprise Storage Systems Tracker. EMC and HPE (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) accounted for 18.1% and 17.6% of spending, respectively, of the enterprise storage market (IDC declares a statistical tie when there is less than 1% difference in the revenue share of two or more vendors.). Dell held the next position with 11.5% share of revenue during the quarter. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and NetApp Inc. accounted for 6.8% and 6.7% of global spending, respectively.Sales of server-based storage were up 9.8% during the quarter and accounted for almost $2.4 billion in revenue. External storage systems remained the largest market segment, but the $5.7 billion in sales represented flat year-on-year growth. However, according to Liz Conner, research manager of storage systems at IDC, spending on all flash-based storage deployments continues to grow and help drive the market, following the decreasing cost of flash media, deployments and availability of flash-based storage products (a sharp focus area for the combined entity, Dell Technologies).ALSO READ |In firms, PCs and smartphones coexist in a multi-device world: Michael DellIn the same period, worldwide server revenue declined 0.8% year-on-year, while shipments grew 2% from the second quarter of 2015, according to Gartner.

HPE continued to lead the x86 server (Intel-based server) market in revenue with 26% of the market. IBM secured the third position with 9.1% of the market, but experienced the largest decline among the top five vendors, according to the Gartner report.Contrarian betsNotwithstanding the scepticism over the merger, there is certainly some merit in Dells claim over the economies of scale that this merger can achieve even as there remain formidable challenges that continue to keep some analysts and clients sceptical. The challenges include concerns over the sum paid for the acquisition, integration challenges, some overlap in products and technologies between Dell and EMC, leadership issues in the combined entity, and partnership conflicts since some Dell partners compete with EMC and VMware.Michael has an opportunity to redefine computing if he reinvests on innovation and can pare back the debt, said R Ray Wang, principal analyst, founder and chairman of Silicon Valley-based Constellation Research Inc. He, however, pointed out that customers and partners remain sceptical, wondering if this is an exercise to sell off the parts of the acquisition to pay down debt and save Dell, or a strategic play to own the cloud and the future of the data centre.Shedding the enterprise software assets leads us to believe that this may not be an innovation play yet but a move to sell off assets to save Dell. The experience at HP Enterprise is what customers are scared of. They dont want to see their favourite vendors exit the market where massive investments have been made. The challenge is having two legacy players come together for innovation. The math in the accounting makes it hard to believe what innovations will come about. Dell did attempt to address this road map at Dell World but most of our clients remain sceptical, said Wang.Dell is also a contrarian when it comes to defying certain technology trends. For instance, Dell became a private company on 5 February 2013, in a deal led by Silver Lake that was valued at $24.9 billionthe biggest leveraged buyout since the financial crisiseven as other tech firms seek stock market listings. Second, he believes in mergers and acquisitions even as competing companies like Hewlett Packard have split their businesses. Third, while the world is betting on smartphones, his company no longer makes them.I dont think the world needs another smartphone company, says Dell. A smartphone is just another node, explains Dell, adding that all the information you get on a smartphone comes from a data centre. And what you upload, goes back to the data centre.This, for Dell, is a business opportunity since his company provides servers that are used by data centres.Wang agrees that the smartphone market is a bad one to be in and is not worth it when you dont own the OS (operating system).However, the fact is that even as Dell remains optimistic over the future of the PC (desktops and laptops), worldwide PC shipments totalled 68.9 million units in the third quarter of 2016, a 5.7% decline from the third quarter of 2015, according to the preliminary findings of Gartner. This was the eighth consecutive quarter of decline in PC shipmentsthe longest streak in the history of the PC industry.Lenovo Corp. continued to be the worldwide market leader based on preliminary PC shipments, but HP Inc. is nearly tied for this top spot. Segment-wise, Dell claims his company is No. 1 in PCs in terms of revenue but Dell ranked third in terms of shipments with a share of 13.5% in the third quarter of 2016. (All these rankings could change when final shipment results are published by Gartner.) Dell is insistent that revenue is more important than shipments.Banking on innovationWe have been growing (the PC business) for 15 quarters. We want to be profitable so that we can reinvest in innovation, he says. Part of his companys innovation is around the PC computing system, as Jeff Clarke, vice- chairman of operations and president of client solutions, puts it. There is much innovation in the PC computing system... like the computer becoming personal and new experiences with AR/VR that provide users with new ways to interact, explains Clarke. In a 7 September blog, Clarke also points out that beyond the device, workforce transformation requires a cloud-based infrastructure to support peoples new behaviors, new devices and new expectations, which EMC can provide. He also underscored the importance of Airwatch (now a Dell company) as an EMM (enterprise mobility management) solution for managing phones and tablets.And with cloud client-computing VDI (virtual desktop infrastructure solutions) from VMWare, we are the only true end-to-end VDI provider in the industry, from planning to deployment, data center to the endpoint, on- and off-premise. Bottom line: Combining EMCs cloud capabilities with our award-winning PCs, we have just created a very powerful solution, wrote Clarke.For instance, the Dell-EMC product collaboration has resulted in products like VxRaila hyper-converged infrastructure solution from VMware that includes fifth generation Intel Xeon processors and Dells PowerEdge servers. As opposed to a converged infrastructure model (also known as hardware-defined) where the server, networking and storage can be separated if needed, in a hyper-converged infrastructure (referred to as software-defined) the components are integrated and hence cannot be split.The other part of innovation revolves around Dells belief that IoT is fundamentally changing businesses. Explaining his rationale for why we created Dell Technologies, Dell says the planet is becoming more intelligent and more connected by the minute, and ultimately will become intertwined with a vast Internet of Things, paving the way for our customers to do incredible things.Dell elaborated in his speech that as the cost of making something intelligent approaches zero dollars, intelligence is being embedded into every aspect of our physical world. We have about 8 billion connected devices on the planet, and 15 years from now there will be 200 billion or more, and all these sensors and nodes in those devices will provide access to a host of new digital applications, creating massive new sources of information. Using this information to provide better insights and build a better world may be the biggest opportunity in history, he said.Using the premise that everything improves about 10x every five years, Dell in his speech also envisioned a future with smart cities, driverless cars and nanobots that cure cancer and repair cell damage. He added that overnight shipping will seem like snail mail compared to the instant gratification of drone delivery... AR and VR will redefine work, learning and play... machine learning, deep learning, AI and unsupervised learning to all this data will unleash a torrent of innovation and progress and solve some of the worlds greatest challenges.Towards this end, Dell and EMC have made a cumulative research and development (R&D) investment of $12.7 billion over the past three years and plan to invest $4.5 billion in R&D this year, which is multiple times what the competition is investing, Dell said.Dell, for instance, has invested in six worldwide global command centres where technicians constantly monitor events like flight delays, traffic jams, weather conditions, earthquakes or even unsettling events like riots that might impact the companys ability to handle a support call. The technicians track live tweets, live broadcasts of news and weather, and map the location using geographical information systems and Google Earthall in a single window using a customized interface. India (Bengaluru) does not have a global command centre but has a social media listening command centre.In June, Dells Extreme Scale Infrastructure group unveiled Tritona liquid cooling technology that scores over traditional air-cooled solutions for data centres. It designed this water-based system to cool server chips (developed with Intel Corp.) in eBay.coms data centres.In an 18 October note, Mike Krell, lead IoT analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, agreed that Dell Technologies was uniquely positioned to help customers solve their IoT puzzle. Dell, Krell wrote, combines experience and credibility with specific vertical market enterprises, a curated partner ecosystem with deep vertical knowledge, the industrys broadest offering of IoT-focused infrastructure, and an ability to provide a world-class customer experience to help customers solve specific IoT problemstoday.But will Go Big work for Dell?Dells growth strategy also revolves around acquisitions, which Dell says will continue. Ever since Michael Dell returned to the company as its chief executive in 2007, the company has spent as much as $15 billion on more than 30 acquisitions prior to the $67 billion EMC purchase. These included EqualLogic ($1.4 billion; storage area networks, where EMC dominates), Perot Systems ($3.9 billion; IT services), SecureWorks ($612 million; security services, where EMCs RSA division has a big presence), Force10 ($700 million; data centre Ethernet switches) and Quest Software ($2.4 billion; system management and security software), among others.However, not all of those acquisitions have done well for Dell, including some with a significant presence in the Indian market (security provider SonicWALL, for instance). According to a 20 June report on TechCrunch, while Dell had reportedly paid $3.6 billion for Quest Software and SonicWALL, it was only able to recoup around $2 billion for the duo when it sold them to private equity firm Francisco Partners and hedge fund Elliott Management. Dell also had to sell Perot Systems to Japans NTT Data Corp.  for $3.1 billion in March.Nevertheless, analysts like Ashish Nadkarni, program director for IDCs worldwide infrastructure practice, believe that having a bigger, more full-service portfolio allows the combined company (Dell Technologies) to address a wide range of use cases in a very holistic fashion. In a 16 April note, he pointed out that these solutions could be diverse and even emerging, like IoT and real-time analytics. Dell and EMC can likewise take advantage of synergies when it comes to joint go-to-market efforts around compute, storage, and networking solutions,  wrote Nadkarni.He also believes that since Dell Technologies is a privately-held company, it will be able to offer the flexibility of interesting product road maps and solutions as well as additional purchasing options, like subscription-based offerings, free from the 90-day shot clock pressures typically exerted on public companies.On his part, Dell is clear that his company needs to savour customer relationships. He concludes: There are many customers who do not want to change, and we dont want to change them. There are plenty of opportunities for cross-selling. When we looked at the top 5,000 Dell customers and the top 5,000 EMC customers, we found only 1,000 common ones. So there are enormous opportunities to cross-sell among the portfolio. Customers are excited about that toothey actually like the fact that we are bringing everything together with these engineered and integrated solutions. Thats what we are focused on.",2016-11-15,qV03Hr8aiVWnLwqzhDJqpM,Dell is leveraging its EMC acquisition to offer services and solutions for companies to cope with the fast-transforming digital landscape,04:42,Will Dell make it big with EMC?
0.63,"Wipro Ltd, for now, is lagging behind Infosys Ltd in growth. Still, when it comes to mergers and acquisitions (M&As) and investments in start-ups made by the two rivals over the last two years, Infosys Ltds boss Vishal Sikka may want to look at Wipros playbook, overseen by chief strategy officer Rishad Premji. 
				   
				Rishad Premji is the son of Wipro chairman Azim Premji, and reports to Wipro chief executive officer Abidali Neemuchwala.Over the last year, Infosys, surprisingly, has shied away from buyouts, despite spending $390 million to purchase three firms in the first year of Sikkas tenure (see chart). Infosys is grappling with finding a stable management team to steer its M&A division. In July this year, Sikka asked Deepak Padaki to head the M&A team, just 18 months after Infosys reposed faith in Sikkas former SAP colleague, Ritika Suri, to oversee the M&A division.Finally, the pace of investments in start-ups made by Infosys has slowed; the firm has made only two investments since January. Infosys has spent some $33 million (out of its $500 million fund to invest in start-ups) to buy stakes in eight start-ups and an undisclosed amount in Vertex Ventures, a Palo Alto-based venture capital firm. Seven of these investments were made in 2015.M&A is an important theme for Infosys as the management expects $1.5 billion in new revenue from buyouts as part of Sikkas ambitious target of hitting $20 billion in revenue by March 2021. The three buyouts made by Infosys, for now, are estimated to bring less than $90 million in revenue.Wipros strategy is the most aggressive among home-grown IT firms, and can become a template for both Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys, its bigger rivals, in how to better deploy cash and also invest in areas which can make outsourcing companies future-ready.Wipro, in the last 18 months (since April last year, when Neemuchwala joined the company as chief operating officer), has spent over $1.13 billion in making four buyouts which, in addition to making the firm future-ready, together bring in over $550 million in revenue. TCS boss N. Chandrasekaran has not made a single buyout or an investment in start-ups in the last two years. Wipro has done a better job of M&A than most IT services firms to date, said Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm. They (Wipro) have been more deliberate whereas Accenture has been very aggressive, although the net results are the same. Wipro has got new service mixes and capabilities along with new clients. One aspect is the emphasis of taking company cultural considerations into play.Wang said that it appears that Infosys has slowed down M&As and venture activities. Infosys maintains that it continues to evaluate firms and start-ups and there is no slowdown in decision-making. Im very focused that every business unit should not have more than one acquisition to integrate and digest, Neemuchwala told Mint last week, explaining that M&As will bring in a significant share of revenue in Wipros ambition of becoming a $15 billion firm by 2020.Wipro has spent over $22 million (of a $100 million fund) in picking minority stakes in seven start-ups and a venture fund.Sikkas and Rishad Premjis style of running their M&A and venture arms is also different, as none of Infosyss executives, including Suri (who oversees Infosys Innovation Fund), have any experience in the venture capital space. In contrast, Wipros venture arm is run by Venu Pemmaraju, a former senior investment manager at Intel Capital, and company executive Biplab Adhya, who both report to Rishad Premji.One of the biggest benefits Wipro has accrued from its buyouts is that it has managed to retain the tag of Indias third largest software services firm, leaving HCL Technologies Ltd to be content at the fourth position.Wipro does not spell out the growth brought in from its four buyouts and the organic growth, but a senior executive conceded that the growth in core IT services has considerably slowed down. If Wipro manages to grow at the upper end of its 2% growth forecast in the fourth quarter, it will add $445.3 million in incremental revenue in calendar year 2016. The four buyouts are estimated to have accounted for at least $350 million in new business, translating to about 78% of all new business.HCL Technologies, which reported $6.23 billion in yearly revenue at the end of March 2016, will end with $7.04 billion in revenue at the end of March next year if it manages to grow at the managements at-best 13% annual guidance. Wipro, which does not give annual growth guidance, is expected by analysts to report at-best 5.5% growth, translating to the company recording $7.75 billion in revenue at the end of the current financial year.",2016-10-29,qeaQ9hDqenc00ogIsHBKlM,"Wipros M&A strategy, overseen by Rishad Premji, is the most aggressive among home-grown IT firms, and can become a template for TCS and Sikkas Infosys",00:03,Has Wipros Rishad Premji triumphed over Infosyss Vishal Sikka? 
0.71,"Infosys Ltds December quarter results were in line with Street expectations, which isnt great news because expectations had been running low. Revenues fell 1.4% sequentially to $2.551 billion, largely due to the ramp-down of a large project with Royal Bank of Scotland Plc. (RBS) subsidiary Williams and Glyn.
				   
				While the trouble with the RBS project was already known, it turns out that revenues from some other large clients also fell meaningfully last quarter. Revenue from the top 10 clients fell as much as 9.1% sequentially. The RBS project is estimated to have accounted for about half of that decline, which means revenue from other large customers fell 4.5% sequentially.The company management played this down, saying this was due to the seasonal weakness that is typical of the December quarter. Customers take furloughs and have a lower number of working days at the end of a calendar year.But the companys guidance for the full year and the March quarter doesnt inspire much confidence either. According to analysts at Emkay Research, the annual guidance suggests revenue growth of 0.3-1.8% in the March quarter in constant currency terms, which is lower than the 1.9% sequential growth reported by the company in the corresponding period a year ago.ALSO READ | Infosys cuts full-year revenue guidance againThe company said certain pockets of headwinds and some client specific changes are responsible for the guidance, even though most of the verticals it operates in look set for a bounce-back. Analysts at Nomura Research said in a recent note to clients that improvement in demand for IT services could be lagged and likely to reflect only by 2QFY18. They added that the recovery is not uniform with the US banking and financial services (BFS) sector improving, and European BFS, telecom, retail and healthcare client financials showing soft trends, and that the policy uncertainty on immigration in US/regulation in BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) could keep momentum slow at the start of the year.Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services Ltds December quarter results and related commentary provide little reason for any optimism. Its hardly suspiring stocks of both companies fell on Friday, with the latter falling by over 4% thanks to additional concerns about the change in its leadership.ALSO READ: TCS Q3 profit rises 8% to $1 billion, beats forecastsA silver lining in Infosyss results was a slight improvement in margins, despite headwinds such as lower employee utilisation due to furloughs and the ramp-down of the RBS contract. Besides, a drop in revenue typically results in lower economies of scale. In fact, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities and JP Morgan India had estimated margins to fall by 80-100 basis points. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.But while higher margins and the better-than-expected profit are welcome, investors are far more interested in growth returning to double-digit levels.

0.08,"Mumbai: Adding a fresh twist to the nearly two-month-old battle with Tata Sons Ltd, Cyrus P. Mistry on Monday announced his decision to not contest the forthcoming extraordinary general meetings (EGMs) and instead step down from the board of all the operating companies where he is a director.
ALSO READ | Cyrus Mistry cedes space to take moral high groundIn his first media interaction since the boardroom putsch that forced him to exit, Mistry said he is shifting gears and taking the fight with Tata Sons to a bigger platform, hinting, perhaps, at legal challenges to come. He said Tata Sonss coercive behaviour and uncertainty facing the shareholders had made him decide to quit. Edited excerpts:What prompted this decision to step down?I think the reason for the decision is wedded in the history of the Pallonji family, which has always supported the Tata group. What I have seen in the last eight weeks is a significant coercive behaviour from Tata Sons with employees and other stakeholders,  and as you see in their EGM notice, a threatening attitude, creating a situation of tremendous unease.My belief is that from here, the platform has to change to the legal side to ensure we protect the shareholders. The output is still the samewhat we are ensuring is governance reform and ensuring the ethical values of the founder... I will continue to pursue that very vigorously. What we have seen in the last eight weeks as far as the EGMs are concernedthe process has shown a lack of governance which I have detailed out. It has thrown up many ethical issues that have come to the fore. What we also saw in the last eight weeks is the huge amount of uncertainty, which I wanted to put to bed.What was the trigger for the move to step down?There was no trigger. One has to reflect from time to time. What we have achieved so far, is to initiate a dialogues for change and reform. What one would achieve by going ahead with the EGMs would be more destructive than productive.History shows that we have always looked at the best interest of the group. I believe the best interest of the group will be served by taking this to a new platform.What nextI cant discuss the legal strategy, but you will see it unfold.What would be the status of the EGM (of Indian Hotels) which was to take place tomorrow (Tuesday)?I think the EGM will be cancelled.What other steps will you take to ensure that all these governance reforms are carried out?We have brought the dialogue on the table, both from the point of view of governance and ethics, and I think that is today in peoples minds. I believe you will see shareholders in the near future demanding (better) governance.Have there been any instances that make you feel that some of this has already come to the fore?Yes, I think I will not go into the details of which one, but there have been instances of that.And I think also what is important was to first take me out of the equation because if I am in the equation, it gets clouded. I want to take myself out of the equation to make sure this is not a battle about me; this is effectively a battle for company governance reform. So by doing so, I have taken myself out of the position. I have been consistent if you see on the same thingin my EGM, in my representation.Again, I have reiterated this in my letter to the TCS (Tata Consultancy Services Ltd) shareholders. Many shareholders are ready to abstain to send a message to the company that this is not something that they wanted to do.Would Mr Wadias moves have had an impact?Mr Wadia has taken his own independent decision, and I think Mr Wadia might well continue with his position. His position is different from mine; his position is from an independent directors point of view, and, clearly, the fact that I am not contesting the EGM, strengthens his position because there is no question of him supporting me. I think he has always been for the institution of independent directors and thats the fight that he will continue I am sure.Whats the end game in terms of governance reforms that you want to achieve?I think from my perspective whats important is that the (Tata) Trusts themselves look at an appropriate governance structure, whether thats including succession planning, decision-making, and the interface with Tata Sons.ALSO READ | Tata Sons calls Cyrus Mistry resignation a deliberate strategyTata Sons itself at the board (level) has to reform and understand how it interacts with the Trusts and with the operating companies. And I think thats the part of the reform that needs to happen on the governance side. If you look at it on the ethics side, I think people who have been involved in any unethical actions have to vacate office. I think thats crucially important.Why did it take you so long to raise these issues?If you look at it, all of these issues,  whether they are governance reform and ethics, are exactly what I have been raising in Tata Sons. My role in Tata Sons is actually to raise those issues. My shareholders representation has raised the same issues. I have raised those issues again in the TCS letter, so I have been consistent. You will also see that in my statement and you will see that statement in the video (Editor's note: Mistry released a video on Monday explaining his position)  that effectively these were part of the board agenda the day that I was removed, and most probably a part of the reason I was removed as well.Did you these issues before the 24 October board meeting?The governance issues have been raised for a long time; the debate on performance of governance or structures of governance have been there for more than six months may be close to a year.You said in your letter that Ratan Tata said the reason (for removal) will go down with him to his grave...?I am waiting.

-0.26,"Mumbai: The Tata group, in an affidavit filed to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) board, strongly refuted charges levelled by Cyrus P. Mistry, the ousted chairman of Tata Sons, and said Mistry did a poor job of turning around companies such as Tata Steel Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd, resulting in a drop in dividends to the Tata Trusts, The Economic Times reported on Monday, citing the affidavit. 
				   
				It also said Mistry did not pay any heed to Ratan Tatas requests to keep his family business at a distance to avoid conflict of interests.The affidavit is a response to the petition filed by Mistry on 20 December. In his petition Mistry alleged mismanagement and oppression of minority shareholders of Tata Sons and seeking the ouster of the current management of Tata Sons and Tata Trusts. Ratan Tata, in a handwritten letter dated 24 September 2013, seemed alarmed by the conflict of interests between Mistrys family business and Mistrys position as chairman and, therefore, prodded Mistry to set up a so called blind Trust that will disassociate the latter from his Tata shareholding, and also not to have any transaction of business between Shapoorji Pallonji Group and Tata Group as long as Mistry was its chairman. Blind Trust is a popular concept abroad when individuals are keen to avoid any conflicts with another entity their firm has a relationship with. It allows the owner of the stake to relinquish the control of the company during the period when he has other responsibilities. Tata preferred handwritten notes in his correspondence with Mistry, reflecting his desire to keep differences strictly confidential, between him and his then successor. Even as Mistry was removed as the chairman of the $103 billion group only on 24 October 2016, the differences between Mistry and the then chairman emeritus Ratan Tata had surfaced as early as 2013, according to the 37-page affidavit.

It is the trusts which hold a majority stake far exceeding that of Mistrys firms. Such inconsiderate allegations effectively degrade my lifelong contribution to the success story of the Tata Group, which began with Tata.The affidavit also provided a detailed account of why the board lost confidence in Mistrys ability to steer and lead. Tata said Mistry did little to resurrect companies such as Tata Motors. Further, dividends received by Tata Trusts declined.He said it was with a heavy heart that he came to terms with the fact that the group had faltered in their judgement when they chose Mistry as chairman.

-0.13,"San Francisco: Eduardo Frias, chief information officer at Beachbody LLC, recently traveled to San Francisco to hear a pitch from Oracle Corp.s top brass.
				   
				Beachbody was already a longtime user of Oracle business software for such tasks as finances and supply-chain management. Now chairman Larry Ellison wanted to sell Frias on a new product: direct access to remote data centers brimming with servers and networking tools -- a package of services that Santa Monica, California-based Beachbody now buys from cloud-computing leader Amazon.com Inc.Frias was intrigued. Oracle has made a lot of progress developing a product that could compete with Amazon, he said. Theyre doing incredibly, much better than in the past, he said of Oracles pitch at the Oracle OpenWorld conference in September. But Frias, whose company makes the P90X high-intensity home-fitness videos, has yet to take the plunge.Tens of thousands of businesses are loyal to Amazon Web Services, and it wont be easy for Oracle to erode Amazons lead in the market for public cloud computing. Thats not stopping Oracle chief executive officers Mark Hurd and Safra Catz from pouring billions of dollars into big bets on acquisitions, new hires and fresh products to advance Ellisons plan to target the industry. On Monday, they landed a cloud leader when Oracle completed its $9.3 billion acquisition of NetSuite Inc., which specializes in financial software. This latest gambit means less competition with older rivals such as SAP--and more with Amazon, Google and even Microsoft Corp.This is part of a bigger strategy, Hurd said in an interview. Were in the middle of a very significant transition in the IT industry.Brisk growthHurd can point to improving numbers. The growth rate for Oracles most closely watched cloud businesses -- including applications for finance, human resources and databases--jumped to 77% in the quarter ended 31 August, topping 66% in the previous period. These gains outpace those of key rivals, though its starting from a smaller base.But the transition is just beginning, and should have started earlier, some analysts said. Cloud revenue has yet to reach 15% of overall sales--not yet enough to prop up results. As traditional products slowed, total company sales missed estimates, climbing 1.7% in the quarter that ended in August. It was another reminder that the shift to the cloud has been uneven, and is not a fait accompli.Oracle waffled a little; now, theyre done waffling, said Dave Bartoletti, an analyst at Forrester Research. Theres no choice for Oracle but to do this. All of the money is going to cloud software and cloud infrastructure for the next 10 years.Wall Street has mixed opinions about Oracles plans, which could take years to prove out. Shares are up 7% so far this year, narrowly outpacing some of the major indices. Analysts have slightly more buy ratings on the stock than they did a year ago, while sells have fallen.The company has navigated identity changes in the past. It grew from a small database company founded in 1977 to become one of the largest tech companies in the world. It boasts a public market value among the top 50 in the US.Oracle is looking outside itself for help. In fiscal year that wrapped up in May, almost a third of the developer hires in the Oracle Public Cloud group came from competitors, according to a person familiar with the matter.NetSuite DealAcquisitions are also part of the cloud growth strategy. After a lull in large deals, Oracle secured its second-biggest takeover ever with NetSuite, though the deal wasnt without its critics. T. Rowe Price, one of NetSuites largest investors, said the the offer undervalued the target, and asked Oracle to pay $133 per share instead of the agreed-upon $109. NetSuites stock fell to less than $90 at one point in October when it looked like the deal was in jeopardy, yet Oracle insisted its price was final. In the end Oracle won approval with holders of 56% of eligible shares endorsing it.NetSuite provides cloud-based software that manages key functions in finance, part of whats called enterprise resource planning. While the companies have products in the same general areas, there is little direct customer crossover. Almost all of NetSuites customers have 700 or fewer employees, while nearly all of Oracles comparable clients have about 1,000 or more, according to another person with knowledge of the company.Oracle is also moving forward with home-grown tools, and in September unveiled a new plan for its own services for infrastructure, the core computing feature that lets developers easily build applications or work with databases. This business has been the laggard at Oracle, at less than a quarter of the size of the other cloud offerings and with slower growth.Hurd said the latest push -- backed by the companys own big data centers with more efficient servers -- is something new for the business that can help spur the next chapter of growth. Hes betting customers would rather have more products from fewer providers than a patchwork of tools from a smattering of companies. Oracle will let customers move existing applications to the cloud in areas such as human resources and customer relationship management, while providing developer tools and basic computing gear.This is all part of a thoughtful strategy that brings together a holistic cloud suite of services to address the broader market, he said.Amazons databaseThe bigger shift into cloud infrastructure follows Amazons decision to move more aggressively onto Oracles home turf in the database sector, according to Bartoletti. Online retailer Amazon has turned this strategy into a fine art on its traditional commerce side: attracting customers with one product, and then getting them to buy something else.Given Amazon Web Services size and features, its still a one-horse race in the broader market for infrastructure services, said Carl Brooks, an analyst at 451 Research. In the third quarter, Amazon had about 45% of the market for infrastructure as a service, where companies buy basic computing and storage power from the cloud, according to Synergy Research Group. Amazons revenue in this market is more than twice that of the next three players combined, Synergy said.Its helpful from an education standpoint for Oracle to say, Yes, we have AWS-style service capabilities, Brooks said in an e-mail. But theyre not in the same league yet.Ellison went out of his way to tout the new products during his OpenWorld keynotes in September. He didnt hold back underscoring Oracles plan to take on Amazon, mentioning his Seattle-based rivals name more than 60 times during one talk.Amazons lead is over, Ellison said.Amazon didnt exactly embrace Ellisons take. In an interview with Business Insider, AWS CEO Andy Jassy fired back at Ellison, calling the speech a classic old-guard technology tactic, in which a latecomer with less functionality and fewer customers tries to establish itself by manipulating benchmarks. And Amazon has done more to buttress its position, recently unveiling a deal with VMware Inc. to easily manage cloud services.Worth a LookYet Oracles new option is catching some attention. EHarmony has been a customer of Oracle products for about a decade, including the database -- and is using the software makers cloud-based Service feature, which helps clients better connect with their customers, according to Ninish Ukkan, the online dating services senior vice president of technology.We are exploring it -- its too early to say, he said. Because we have such a big footprint with Oracle, especially with our databases, its definitely worth a look.Boingo Wireless is another company that likes what it sees as the software provider ramps up sales efforts to better address the cloud. Boingo, which provides technology for wireless access, has been using Oracles software for its finances since last year after it outgrew a Microsoft offering, according to chief financial officer Peter Hovenier. Oracles sales rep was key in his decision, he said, as he looked at different options for his department.He really impressed upon the fact that this was a growing product for Oracle, he said. And while it was still early, I was getting good attention. Bloomberg",2016-11-08,sAMdv7ZZKtdxsbFcNWAj1L,Oracle has made a lot of progress developing a product that could compete with Amazon,22:22,Oracle widens cloud investments to battle bigger Amazon threat
0.09,"Infosys Ltds chief operating officer U.B. Pravin Rao has warned investors of a bumpy ride in fiscal year 2017. According to him, there are some headwinds in the retail and healthcare business segments, which could lead to quarterly ups and downs in the firms performance.The two segments account for 22.5% of Infosyss revenues. Notwithstanding all this, the company has maintained its annual revenue growth forecast of 11.5-13.5%.
				   
				Investors were naturally disappointed. The chances of the company beating its revenue guidance are now slim. Infosys shares fell 4.6% after Raos comments became public. The moot question for investors in information technology (IT) services companies is whether the entire sectors performance will be choppy this year.According to Rao, Infosys is positioned well in the banking and financial services (BFS) vertical, where it has won large deals and has a strong pipeline.Analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a 7 June note to clients that the financial performance of US and European BFS firms has deteriorated sharply in the March quarter. Revenues of companies that are part of the Fortune 500 fell 10% from a year ago, while their operating profit fell 22%.The financial performance of clients in a sector is typically seen as a lead indicator for IT services demand. Data from the sector, which accounts for about 35% of revenues of Indian IT companies, suggests that FY17 could be a challenging year. Besides, macro data from the US has not been encouraging eitherprivate sector job additions are significantly lower, compared with year-ago levels and consumer confidence has declined.On the other hand, while Rao said that the performance of retail companies in the US has deteriorated and is the poorest in recent times, data collated by Nomura suggests otherwise. The broker said in its note that the performance of US Fortune 500 retail companies remains sluggish, although things havent worsened. To be sure, their revenues and profit were flat in the March quarter, more or less in line with the trend in the preceding quarters.Its likely that the set of clients that Infosys services are more troubled vis-a-vis the average performance of the sector. As such, the FY17 performance of companies will continue to be skewed, and will depend on the exposures that companies have to certain sectors and companies.But, overall, Infosyss latest comments are helpful as they bring in a reality check for some investors who were expecting Infosys to beat its revenue guidance.

0.11,"Finally, in the last quarter (March) of fiscal year 2016, things did get better for Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T), after three quarters of titanic struggle. But even as it posted a stellar operating performance that beat forecasts on revenue, profit and operating margin, order inflows remained elusive.
				   
				If order inflows are an indication of the times to come, then the 9% year-on-year drop in fresh orders during the quarter is not good news. For the 12-month period ended March 2016, the 12% dip in orders inflows fell short of even the management guidance of flat growth. Not to forget that the management had watered down its estimate from 15% at the beginning of the year. Perhaps the loss of orders in the power segment and the pathetic state of the heavy engineering, metals, and electrical and automation segments explains this drop.However, set this factor aside, and L&Ts March quarter leaves nothing for investors to crib about. Consolidated net revenue jumped by 18.3% from a year back as the companys core business segmentinfrastructureclocked 20% revenue growth. Information technology and financial services too contributed sufficiently to revenue growth.Even better was the beat on operating margin. At 14.7%, it topped the 14-broker Bloomberg consensus by 220 basis points as it raced ahead of the year-ago number by 190 basis points. A basis point is 0.01%. Again, margin outperformance came from the infrastructure segment, which more than compensated for the deplorable performance of the heavy engineering and hydrocarbons divisions. Fortunately, these comprise a small portion of the overall business of the juggernaut.Operating performance trickled down and L&T saw a 19% jump in consolidated net profit, way beyond what the Street expected.This is not all. The management, in its media address, appeared optimistic of an economic recovery both on the domestic turf and in overseas markets like West Asia, other regions of Asia and Africa. And it is still sitting on a massive order book of Rs.2.49 trillion, assuring decent revenue growth over the next three years. Some analysts say that with a sizeable chunk of international orders, the company may not be able to sustain the March quarters operating margin in the near term. Interest costs during the quarter rose from a year back, underlining the pressure on working capital.The moot question is: will the stock continue to inch up as it has done in the last three months, after a spark in the March quarter results? Sure, the stock is among the best plays on the economy and has more often than not outperformed benchmark indices.Or, will a drop in order inflows dampen investor sentiment? Yes, the management has guided for a 10-15% growth in order inflows for fiscal year 2017. What must not be ignored, however, is that fiscal year 2016 too started on a similar note but then estimates were trimmed thereafter.

-0.05,"Sydney: When Indias Tata Motors bought Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford in 2008, many investors thought then-chairman Ratan Tata was making a big mistake.
				   
				Ford was selling the units for less than half what it paid to acquire them, just as early tremors of the credit crisis began sapping luxury demand. The day before the deal was announced on 3 January, 2008, West Texas Intermediate crude reached $100 a barrel for the first time, suggesting a tough environment for gas-guzzling sports cars and four-wheel drives.Tatas Nano, a super-cheap one lakh rupee ($1,500) minicar pitched at Indias emerging middle class, was seen as the best prospect, and Jaguar Land Rover looked like an expensive distraction. Moodys and S&P both downgraded Tata Motors, and the stock fell almost 30% in the six months it took to complete the transaction.How have those prognostications turned out?Wrong on almost every count. Jaguar Land Rover now accounts for more than half of Tata Motors unit sales, overtaking the trucks and passenger cars produced by Tata Motors India in the past two quarters, according to annual results released Monday.Helped by a weakening rupee, Jaguar Land Rovers British-pound-denominated sales have risen more than fivefold since the takeover to Rs.2.24 trillion ($33.3 billion) in the year through March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tata Motors Indias are up a relatively modest 74%.Jaguar Land Rover is also more profitable, even after one-time costs of £224 million ($329 million) during the fourth quarter related to Takatas airbags recall and damage from the 2015 Tianjin chemicals explosions. Operating margins averaged 11% over the past five years, versus 1% in the domestic business.Hows the much-hyped Tata Nano doing? Not so well. With sales rarely rising above 2,000 units a month, the Gujarat-based factory that was set up to build it is only running at about 10% capacity. Like the netbook computers that were launched around the same time and likewise failed to change the world, its entry-level pricing couldnt quite compensate for quality that was also a bit bargain basement.Tata Motors India is now focusing its attentions on the stronger mid- and high-cost vehicle segments, and has revamped the Nano with a Rs.1.99 lakh starting price. Spare capacity in the Gujarat plant will be used to make its new Tiago, which costs Rs.3.2 lakh and upwards.What should Ratan Tatas successor Cyrus Mistry do about this situation? One option sure to delight investors would be selling the legacy Tata business to focus entirely on Jaguar Land Rover, as canvassed by Gadflys Andy Mukherjee in March. The problem there is finding a buyer for an unprofitable arm thats also more indebted than its upmarket stablemate.A better idea would be to make the best of a bad job and work at applying lessons learned from the British business. As Nissan has shown since its 1999 alliance with Renault, troubled carmakers are often only a few blockbusting designs away from success. Many investors nowadays regard Tata Motors India as an irredeemable basket case thats lurched from one crisis to another for decades. They thought the same thing of Jaguar Land Rover eight years ago.

				The Indian government knows this. Thus, it is working to turn this start-up ecosystem into a growth engine for the Indian economy. Indian industry is not behind. Big information technology (IT) companies as well as industry bodies like Nasscom have taken it upon themselves to nurture this ecosystem and mentor the abundant young talent in the country.Nasscom has been organizing the countrys largest annual leadership forum for more than two decades. Over the last couple of years, the summits focus has been shifting towards technology start-ups which are slowly, but steadily changing the industrys landscape.

Currently, the industry body is in the middle of hosting the 24th edition the annual summitNILF (Nasscoms India Leadership Forum) 2016 in Mumbai.

There are many more founders and co-founders of start-ups who are looking for funds to sustain their companies, and cannot spare that much.

0.78,"London: Tata Sons interim chairman Ratan Tata was on Sunday hailed as the saviour of the UK steel industry after the Tata Group announced a 10-year commitment of £1 billion investment to save thousands of jobs for its embattled steelworks in the country last week. 
				   
				In a special feature titled Man of Steel, the Sunday Times attributes the thousands of jobs saved in the industry largely to the sacking of Cyrus Mistry and Ratan Tata stepping in as interim chairman. Last weeks abrupt change of heart owes much to a terse board meeting in Mumbai on 24 October. At that meeting the board of Tata Sons, the parent company that sits astride an empire spanning steel to tea, sacked its chairman Cyrus Mistry and reinstated his predecessor Ratan Tata, the report said. Describing Ratan Tata as the architect of the £6.1-billion acquisition of Corus in 2007, it quotes insiders as saying that the 78-year-old tycoon was never comfortable with the idea of abandoning Tata Steels Welsh plant at Port Talbotthe UKs largest steelworks. Now he is back at the helm, Port Talbot has won a reprieve, it notes. Tata is said to have been painfully aware that the closure of Port Talbot would devastate the town already marred by poverty. As the head of the (Tata company) charity, Ratan is not like that. You dont want to get rid of vast chunks of people and create mass unemployment. Ratan was quite upset at the way he (Mistry) was dealing with Tata Steel. There were all these whispers that he (Ratan) did the wrong thing in buying Corus, the newspaper quotes an insider as saying. Nearly 11,000 British workers at Tata Steel have been rejoicing after the company has indicated that it would not take any dividends from its British plants until their profit tops £200 million a year. The company made the pledge last week as part of a plan that will keep the Port Talbot site in south Wales open until at least 2021. It promised no job cuts for five years and to pump £1 billion into its UK plants over 10 years. Tata said in a statement, The immediate target of £200 million provides sufficient funds to invest in the business and to manage working capital needs. However, beyond this level the business will balance the needs of all its stakeholders, including the financing of dividends.

0.88,"Bengaluru: Wipro chief executive officer Abidali Neemuchwala, who is based out of Dallas, US, could not fly down to Bengaluru when the company declared its second- quarter earnings last week because of a prior engagement. 
				   
				However, in a telephone interview with Mint, Neemuchwala said that Wipro is well-positioned and on its way to make itself a future-ready firm. The former Tata Consultancy Services Ltd veteran, who joined the company in April 2015 as the chief operating officer and took over as the CEO in February this year, has taken steps to improve Wipros delivery and sales capabilities. Edited excerpts: Due to slow growth and declining profitability, and the way technology is changing, many commentators and analysts have questioned the Indian IT outsourcing industry and are pronouncing the death of Indian IT. What are your thoughts? I would not agree with the death of Indian IT. Indian IT has always had the resilience or ability to transform itself. It has the flexibility, the nimble-footedness. One of our industrys core competencies has been our ability to train a large number of people. Now is the market changing? The answer is definitely yes. So what has made us successful in the pastis that going to make us successful in the future? The answer is certainly no. Will change be required? The answer is yes. Will Wipro be able to undergo that change? Absolutely yes. I am absolutely confident. Are we well-positioned as a company? The answer is yes. This is because I have always believed Wipro as a company is entrepreneurial. We are also very technology-centric. We have made investments in digital technologies, like Internet of Things and cloud. We are making the organisation simple and nimble-footed. We are democratising the operating structure where every single unit can run with that. We started hyper automation and now we are ahead of our plan. So going forward times for Wipro will be better than in the past and I wouldnt call it a doomsday scenario.Its now been over eight months and two full quarters with you as CEO. What has been, say, two heartening features for you as the boss and issues which have disappointed you, which you believe could have made your company do better?Two most heartening things which I have seen in the eight months are that our strategy and ambition resonates and percolates to employees and customers. This is very important for any CEO. Simply, because no single CEO can do magic in a company unless the CEO has the power of the organisation. And at the same time making employees believe that their future is tied to the future of the company. I am very glad that we have been able to do this and that is a very heartening thing for me. We had a very stable CEO transition (on 1 February Neemuchwala was appointed as CEO and his predecessor T.K. Kurien was appointed executive vice-chairman). We have a very stable top management team. The kind of changes we wanted to do at the top, we have been able to do without losing the senior leadership talent pool. The second thing is that as we started articulating our strategy, our customers are lapping up to this strategy. The newly-acquired and newly-built capabilities like Wipro Digital or Wipro Consulting or our hyper automation journey combined with Wipro Holmes, or our investments through Wipro ventures... we are able to take these capabilities to each one of our customers. On the other hand, the speed of change which is required and the speed of change a knowledge-based organisation can undergo is something which I would be happier if we could do it faster. Yes, we are an over 170,000-people-strong company. But the pace of change, the training, the way we are changing our processes, all of it I wish I could get done faster. Its not to say Im dissatisfied with the pace but it would be heartening if we could bring this change faster than what we are doing.Two-full quarters as CEO, and you have embarked on a journey by articulating six broad themes. Given these measures you have started, the management has said in the past that a complete turnaround will take time. Will it be fair to ask if the company can come back or say end March 2018 with industry-matching growth or Nasscom-projected growth numbers?Im always careful of putting a timeline and so I believe it is not unreasonable to expect this (by coming to industry-matching growth number by March 2018). I feel very confident and I see green shoots coming in a more sustainable manner. Im very hopeful that four-five quarters is a good time for a very visible outcome or metric for an industry-leading growth or margin.One of the things which is of concern now for many is that despite making three buyouts, with a combined revenue of $340 million, in the last financial year, and this fourth buyout of Appirio, Wipro is not able to record impressive growth. So on the merger and acquisition (M&A) front, how are you going to make sure Wipro is able to integrate buyouts well and scale up business?I think there are two parts. First is having a bold and risk taking ability to buy. And second is staying the course and making these acquisitions successful. We have shown that we certainly have the former. Now, its time to focus on the latter. So take for example, our acquisition of DesignIt (Wipro Ltd acquired Denmark-based DesignIt for $95 million in July last year). When we acquired it, we had 300 designers. Now we have 450 designers. That company on its own has never seen that kind of explosive growth. I feel very confident that we have the right balance where we dont give our buyouts such a tight embrace that we squeeze the company. We keep these buyouts in our shadow but not alone. I believe we have learnt from our past mistakes. Now HealthPlan Services (Wipro spent $460 million to buy HealthPlan Services in February this year) is a recent buyout but I do see very early synergy wins there. Although right now because of US elections and some issues in the Healthcare Payer market, there is a level of uncertainty. Cellent (Wipro paid $78 million in December last year to buy German firm Cellent) is taking a bit longer than the other two but that is because of cultural issues. Also, Im very focused that every business unit should not have more than one acquisition to integrate and digest. So Cellent is under manufacturing and Continental Europe. Appirio will sit with business applications. DesignIt sits with digital.These four buyouts bring over $550 million in revenue. So clearly M&A is going to play a big part of your ambitious target of becoming a $20 billion firm by 2020. What percentage of revenue do you expect to generate from M&A?We dont break out organic or inorganic revenue growth because it can be a bit misleading. But directionally, I can tell you that M&A will not be insignificant. It will be substantial and not small. The ticket size you are seeing is already bold from the Indian IT perspective. But we will not acquire to buy revenue or scale.",2016-10-24,u0swvRQUwz7X2V8n7hWWYN,"Indias IT sector has always had the resilience or ability to transform itself, says Abidali Neemuchwala ",10:45,IT sector not looking at doomsday scenario: Wipro CEO Abidali Neemuchwala

				In a note released on Monday, titled Tata-Mistry: Shareholders vs board, battle for supremacy, proxy advisory firm Stakeholders Empowerment Services (SES) prods the independent directors to explain to the stakeholders their divergent views to remove all doubts about the subsequent events that have unfolded since the boardroom coup on 24 October.It also questions the manner in which Mistry was removed from his position as a chairman from the TCS board. In a notification to the exchanges, on 10 November, TCS informed the decision to appoint Ishat Hussain as chairman on the Board of TCS in place of Mistry. SES does not agree that powers of Board or decisions of Board can be changed by shareholders in this manner.Among other things, the report highlights the conflicting stand of some of the independent directors. For instance, Keki Dadiseth, an independent director at Indian Hotels Co. Ltd (IHCL) who applauded the performance of Mistry, is also a trustee of Sir Ratan Tata Trust (SRTT). SRTT is one of the two principal Tata Trusts which control two thirds in Tata Sons, it is also a shareholder in IHCL. It seems like (Mr). Keki Dadiseth has taken two different stands, one where he supports (Mr) Mistry, other where he was also involved in decision making process for replacing (Mr) Mistry as a Trustee of SRTT. Same is true for Narsee Munjee.said the report. SES said unless they come out and state the reason for their diverse views, doubts would remain.On the issue of removal of Nusli Wadia, SES pointed out that while legally Tata Sons has every right to seek removal of any director on board, be it independent director, executive director or otherwise, the issue is whether such an act is ethically right and would pass the benchmark of good governance.SES said it believed the independent directors and all other directors on the board should be driven by interest of the shareholders. Directors (including IDs) do not have the mandate or right to adjudicate and pronounce right or wrong, it said. A divided board, said SES, is not in the interest of the stakeholders and the foundation of collective responsibility cannot survive in a divided board. A divided board is like a vehicle with driver at both ends, each trying to move in his own direction. Division at board level unlike dissent, which reflects a healthy board, is counterproductive and destroys shareholder value.It is in real sense a testing time for them, said the report, alluding to independent directors. It questions the basis on which the independent directors of Indian Hotels and Tata Chemicals Ltd decided to back Mistry. Do they know the truth? If yes, please tell the same to all investors? If not, can they adjudicate based on letters of two sides and decide? Does their job involve adjudication? Are they competent for adjudication? questioned the report. In one way, according to SES, they are guilty of the same hurried decision, which Mistry is complaining of. Adjudication is a process and one cannot decide without serious application of mind taking into account all factors. Have IDs done that? the report asked further.SES, the report pointed out, has been of the view that the action of removing Mistry on an immediate basis was disproportionate to the cause attributed for the decision. Assuming it was based on non-performance, it is difficult to believe that non-performance could be an overnight development which assumed such an enormity that immediate action was required, it said.Indian corporates materially differ from the rest of the developed countries, especially those in the US and the UK, in their ownership structure. In India, almost all companies have a dominant shareholder called promoter. In the US and the UK, holding/ownership is generally dispersed and no one is a promoter, pointed out SES. By equating dominant shareholders at par with minority shareholders, the law has created mismatch of risks and rights. This leads to non-transparent control mechanisms, it said.",2016-11-14,uBjMztpUXe0TSqvrlwd39L,Proxy advisory firm Stakeholders Empowerment Services prods independent directors of Tata group to explain to stakeholders their divergent views ,14:21,Its testing time for Tata group independent directors: SES

At the end of 2015, only about 30% of our revenue was from ERP and 70% was non-ERP, Deb Deep Sengupta, president and managing director, India subcontinent region, SAP, said in an interview.Sengupta acknowledged that while the benefits of ERP became visible in large enterprises, there was this perception that for a smaller company, SAPs technology is very hard to adopt and very expensive too. To address the issue, SAP India introduced many best practices from the implementations it had done in countries such as Brazil and Latin America. We created some packages for micro-verticals (small, specialized industry segments) and created an ecosystem of implementation partners that did not exist earlier, Sengupta said.SAP India also started working with agencies that do nation-building such as the railways, utility companies, ports and airports. We also worked a lot with the defence and home ministries, Sengupta added.In 2010, SAP launched its High-performance Analytic Appliance (HANA) software platform, which enables data processing in real or near-real time for quick business insights and improved decision-making. HANA can be deployed on premise or on the cloud, a model whereby firms do not spend upfront on licensing and equipment but pay on a per-use basis.SAP has also spent billions of dollars on acquiring firms whose solutions are cloud-centric. Some examples include Hybris, SuccessFactors, Ariba, Concur and Fieldglass. These, Sengupta said, have helped SAP rise to the world No. 2 spot in terms of revenue from cloud computing applications in 2015. Globally, we now have over 200 million users on the cloud.Even the core ERP, now christened S/4HANA has been completely re-tooled. In less than a year since its launch in 2015, we have deployed this solution in more than 2,700 companies. It is available on the cloud and on-premise. You can also deploy it in a hybrid model, Sengupta said.The 20.8-billion company, which has about 8,000 employees in India, does not give a break-up of its India revenue, but Dataquesta Cyber Media (India) Ltd publicationpegged the companys India revenue at Rs10,705 crore in fiscal 2015-16.SAP dominates the ERP software market in India; Dataquest reporting its market share at about 47%. Its product portfolio includes analytics, customer relationship management (CRM), expense management, human capital management and business-to-business commerce.The key verticals for SAP in India, according to Sengupta, are manufacturing, consumer goods, professional services and public services. Banking, financial services and insurance is another rapidly-growing vertical for the company, even though competitor Oracle Corp. leads in this space.For Sengupta, digital is not just about the front end; its an integrated thing. Its about the experience, which well provide. He observed that while digital firms are building an offline presence, physical ones are going digital too, known as the phygital trend. Sengupta cited the examples of US sportswear brand Under Armour and the multi-brand digital marketplace of the Tata group in India, Tata CLiQ, as examples of companies going phygital. To cater to this need, SAP announced the launch of the SAP Digital Boardroom in October 2015. According to Sengupta, the boardroom is a digital approach that aims to contextualize and simplify performance reporting across all areas of business in real time. Built on the SAP Cloud for Analytics Solution, the SAP Digital Boardroom incorporates fully automated business intelligence capabilities that aim to dramatically improve the quality and speed of reporting as well as collaboration in real time.SAP is also providing cutting-edge technology solutions to its clients. For instance, it has around 100 engineers working on machine learning, and that team is constantly expanding, said a 1 December 2016 report by research firm Market Realist. SAP is hoping to leverage machine learning to strengthen its cloud-based human resources suite SuccessFactors. Besides machine learning, SAP has also stepped up its investments to drive blockchain innovation. Blockchain is the technology that underlies cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Zcash.If SAP succeeds in its machine learning efforts, it could reduce competition for its products and pave the way for more revenue, the Market Realist report said. But it also cautioned that SAPs aggressive push into machine learning would put the firm on a collision course with Alphabet Inc. (parent of Google Inc.), which is also heavily into artificial intelligence research.The Internet of Things (IoT) is another area of focus for SAP; it announced an investment of 2 billion over five years in the IoT segment. As part of this plan, SAP acquired Plat.Onean IoT services providerlast September.To be sure, SAP will have its fair share of challenges in the coming years, especially in cloud computing, said analysts. For one, SAP does not have its own data centre in India yet. Sengupta pointed out that SAP is tying up with local partners for cloud services in India, but analysts remained sceptical.The growth has been easy for SAP in India when it came to the top 100 enterprises and then another 300-odd large companies, but the joy ride ends now, said Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst and CEO of Greyhound Research. He pointed out that Indian firms are wary about data residing in a foreign country. Gogia added that SAP has not found many takers for its expensive HANA. Though some enterprises have technically bought HANA licences, there are only a few of implementations in the country, as not all ERP modules are ready yet on HANA. Another reason for the lukewarm response to HANA is the lack of skill sets on HANA in India, Gogia noted.The upcoming goods and services tax (GST) regime, which would need ERP to be modified or upgraded for compliance, could also pose a challenge for SAP, Gogia said. While SAP is mandating its clients to buy S/4HANA licences if they want to migrate their existing SAP solution to a GST-compatible version, other vendors are offering to supply the GST patch for free, Gogia noted, warning that firms may shift their custom to other vendors as they embrace GST.The competition is undoubtedly stiff with the likes of Amazon Web Services (AWS), CenturyLink, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and Salesforce offering public cloud platforms. AWS and Microsoft lead the pack among global public cloud platform providers for enterprise developers. IBM and Google offer competitive options. Oracle, Salesforce, CenturyLink and SAP lag behind, according to a 29 August 2106 report by Forrester analysts Dave Bartoletti and John R. Rymer.Among the megacloud providers, SAP is a challenger, the report said. The analysts pointed out that while the HANA cloud platforms greatest strength is in shielding developers from all infrastructure configuration tasks when working with SAP business suites, companies must determine whether the platform is a good choice to also build and deploy applications that are independent of SAPs business suites since the HANA cloud platform offers only a limited set of application development and delivery functions. SAP, according to analysts, is yet to step up to the full range of language run times, databases, and analytics services of the leaders, although SAP recently released an IoT service to all customers. As a new entrant in the market, SAPs partner roster for HANA cloud platform is small, as is adoption of its platform, the report concluded.",2017-01-16,uLYxZE6K7ZZ85besrpDTIK,"SAP, the German ERP software company, has successfully made inroads into cloud computing and digital solutions",00:42,SAP: The road beyond ERP

				Most premium office buildings in Mumbai, Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), and Bengaluru are fully leased out, while a few of them have vacancies of 2-5%.In Mumbais financial hub of Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), prime office buildings such as One BKC, The Capital, Trade Centre and Platina are 90-100% leased out, company executives and property advisors said. Cybercity and Two Horizon Center, DLFs office space buildings in Gurgaon are 95% occupied, an executive at the developer said, asking not to be identified.Bengaluru-based commercial real estate firm RMZ Corp., which owns around 15 million sq. ft of office space across six properties in the city, said it has about 2% vacant space. RMZs office buildings in Delhi and Mumbai are fully leased out.As per global property adviser JLLs estimates, overall supply of office space in India is pegged at 40 million sq. ft in the next one year. Of this, about 70% or less than 30 million sq. ft is in grade A office buildings. But the forecast for office absorption stands at around 33-34 million sq. ft over the next one year. Last year, net absorption across seven cities was 36.5 million sq. ft.In Bengaluru, where office absorption was the highest in the country at 10.8 million sq. ft last year, rental values of prime commercial properties have shot up by as much as 20% in the last one year. Rentals are moving up because there is dearth of supply and also because of improving qualities. Amenities are getting better. Inflation has also moved up. So overall costs, including construction and land are also rising, said Thirumal Govindraj, managing director (management), RMZ Corp., adding that rentals will move up further over the next one or two years.He said at the companys under-construction Ecoworld office building in Bengaluru, deals are being closed at a monthly rental of Rs80 per sq. ft, against Rs60-65 last year. At its Infinity building on Old Madras Road, rentals are about Rs90 per sq. ft now, from Rs76-77 last year.Monthly rentals in Mumbai have risen by around 3-8% in the last one year, according to JLL estimates. But in a few prime buildings at BKC, rents have remained unchanged, for instance in Wadhwa Groups Trade Centre and The Capital, which are 100% leased out. At present, rents at most commercial buildings in the area hover between Rs230 and Rs320 per sq. ftamong the highest in Mumbai.Growth in rental values in a few good assets in Mumbai has exceeded 10%such growth was last seen five years ago, said Ashutosh Limaye, head (research), at JLL India. While it (rents) has grown over the last few years, the margin of growth has been smaller by around 2-3%. However, rentals in a few select properties have appreciated by around 5-10%, he said.Commercial real estate rentals are likely to rise further in the next one year with no significant fresh supply expected over the next two years, while demand, particularly from the information technology and pharmaceutical sectors, is continuing to grow, said developers and real estate advisors. Most of the new commercial projects in Lower Parel, Wadala and the western suburb region in Mumbai are still on the drawing board. Even if it were to come back in the market, supply wouldnt probably hit the market till about 2019-20, said Gautam Saraf, managing director (Mumbai), Cushman & Wakefield. While prices of commercial properties may rise by 5% in 2017, rentals may see a double-digit growth in the next one year, he added. In Delhi-NCR, rents in DLFs Cybercity are currently at around Rs105-Rs115 per sq. ft, as per JLLs latest monthly real estate monitor. A year ago, they were around Rs95-100 per sq. ft.

0.07,"New Delhi: Information technology (IT) vendors are complaining about difficulties in executing government ordersfrom inflexible contactual terms to delays in paymentsalthough both the centre and states are farming out more work to IT companies.
				   
				Take, for instance, NIIT Technologies Ltd. In the June quarter, the firm reported a 47.5% fall in net profit due to a provision of Rs36 crore for dues it was yet to receive on a government contract, which been put on hold. The companys India business declined 7.2% sequentially in the quarter to September because it earned lower revenue from the government. India now accounts for just 7% of its total revenue.It (India business) impacts cash flow because it is very difficult to collect money from the Indian government... by defocusing on Indian government, we have been able to dramatically reduce the outstandings that we have to the cash flow, said Arvind Thakur, chief executive officer of NIIT Technologies.Both the central and state governments have stepped up spending on IT and e-governance projects. Rigidities built into requests for proposals (RFPs), which dont take into account the complexities involved in project execution, and delays in clearing invoices have offset the attractiveness of contracts.Payment terms and conditions tend to be skewed towards the end of the contract period. The problem worsens in case the project has a significant hardware component that has to be delivered and installed early on in the project life cycle, according to lobby National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom).Delayed payments create serious cash flow challenges for industry, especially smaller and medium IT vendors, and can make projects financially unviable.Day sales outstanding last year was typically between 85-90 days because of all the money stuck in domestic government projects. This quarter, it is 73 days because we reduced dependence on government. So, the entire cash position has changed dramatically, Thakur said. Day sales outstanding  refers to the average number of days that a company takes to collect revenue after a sale has been made.Indias third largest IT firm Wipro Ltd in September threatened to initiate legal proceedings against the Employees State Insurance Corp. (ESIC), a government entity, due to non-payment of dues. The company entered into a seven-year contract in 2009 with ESIC as a system integrator to set up a health administration programme for Rs1,200 crore. Wipro has completed its obligations under the contract. However, ESIC has withheld certain amounts due to Wipro in an ad-hoc and arbitrary manner, which has resulted in significant delay in collections for Wipro, the company said in a filing to the BSE on 7 SeptemberWipro did not respond to emailed questions. HCL Technologies Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd did not respond to questions citing the so-called silent period ahead of quarterly earnings announcements. Emails sent to Infosys Ltd and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd remained unanswered.The government awards contracts through L1, or the Least Cost Selection method. While L1 is the norm in procurement of IT hardware and software, there are other selection methods which should be encouraged taking into account the complexity and strategic importance of the project, IT vendors say.The industry has been engaging with the government to implement new RFPs and implement new methods of selection such as quality and cost based selection (QCBS), quality based selection (QBS) and fixed price bids.We are suggesting we look at model RFPs so that this issue of different departments, different states, everybody having different payments condition and terms, dont arrive, said Sangeeta Gupta, senior vice-president, Nasscom.",2016-10-19,urXvP8YFo0vOHsSHgjOWlJ,"Though both the centre and state govts have stepped up spending on IT, delays in clearing invoices have offset the attractiveness of the contracts",00:52,IT firms complain of payment delays by the government

RIL remains convinced of being able to fully justify and vindicate its position that the governments claim is not sustainable, the company said in a emailed statement on 4 November.We felt that the penalty, if any, that RIL could be liable to pay should be limited to the net cumulative earnings before interest and taxes (Ebit) earned by it from the disputed volumes, which we had estimated at Rs16 billion.

0.24,"Singapore: Japan Inc. is getting a raw deal in India. Some of its high-profile investments in the country have created more wealth for arbitration lawyers in London and Singapore than they have for shareholders. Those who were expecting great things from the bromance between Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi have reasons to be disappointed.
				   
				Two soured deals are NTT Docomo Inc.s $2.2 billion investment in an Indian wireless venture with the Tata Group, and the $4.6 billion Daiichi Sankyo Co. shelled out to buy Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd, a generic drugmaker. Almost a decade on, the Japanese companies have won claims to compensation via international arbitration proceedings, but in neither case is there any sign of a check in the mail.The Docomo dispute might be quicker to resolve. Ratan Tata, who recently reclaimed control of the conglomerate in a boardroom putsch, is reportedly keen to settle. It was he who had promised to buy out Docomo at a 50% loss on its original investment in five years.But when the Japanese tried to exercise their put option in 2014, the Indian group contended that in local law, a guaranteed exit price would become unwelcome foreign debt masquerading as equity, therefore, the Tatas could neither honour their commitment, nor fulfil the arbitration award the Japanese company won last year in London.ALSO READ: Tata-Mistry ties strained further with Tata Motors 2015 rights issue: AffidavitDaiichi Sankyos misery began when it acquired Ranbaxy from brothers Malvinder Singh and Shivinder Singh in 2008. Shortly after, US regulators barred more than 30 drugs made at two of the Indian companys plants and also halted reviews of new products at one of the factories because the company had falsified data. In May last year, the Singapore International Arbitration Centre awarded Daiichi a $376 million claim against the Singh brothers for suppressing facts, which had cost Ranbaxy an expensive settlement with the US regulator. Japan Inc.s total outbound mergers and acquisitions (M&A) last year stood at $79.7 billion.That victory doesnt mean much. The siblings are contending that the Singapore award is invalid under Indian law. Daiichi, which has already exited India at a loss, is now hoping the courts there will stop the Singh brothers from selling a stake in their hospital chain Fortis Healthcare Ltd before settling their claim. Earlier this month, Mint reported that KKR & Co. was in talks with the brothers to buy Fortis, which has an enterprise value of $1.5 billion. In a new twist, Daiichi claims it just found out that one of the Singh brothers investment companies it sued to recover the money from no longer exists.The longer such wrangles linger, the stronger the impression that Indias local laws make it impossible to settle commercial disputes with foreigners. Japanese firms arent the most ambitious of dealmakers in emerging markets anyway. Their total acquisitions in Brazil, Russia, India and China have amounted to just $25 billion over the past six years, of which Indias share has been $4.4 billion. By contrast, American companies spent $5.1 billion shopping in India last year.Abe wants the coyness to end and hopes for a big role in Indias railway modernization. However, for long-gestation infrastructure projects, sanctity of contract enforcement will be even more important. New Delhis tax regime is already a minefield.

Edited excerpts from an interview:What will be your focus area as the new CEO?One very important thing that we have articulated to the market is our Mode 123 strategy. This is all about how we can map the customer spend and fine-tune our services to make it relevant to the spend. We have mode 1 services which are traditional services such as infrastructure, application, engineering services and BPO (business process outsourcing). These are momentum services and we believe these markets are still under-served. Only 49% of global 2,000 companies have outsourced. Then still there are a lot of re-bid opportunities, $150 billion worth of re-bid is on and year on year its $40-50 billion. Its a big opportunity.You have made niche acquisitions such as those of Volvo for automotive and Butler America for aerospace. Are you more focused on gaining technology instead of acquiring customers?We want to focus on intellectual property (IP). If you want to future-proof your business, I think products and IPs are very important, so whether you can overnight build products and IPs of very high valueno. By this partnership and niche acquisitions, we will start building it in the long term. I think its really a very important strategy for us.Are you planning to appoint a new head of the infrastructure business, and will the COO position be filled?Its something I have to think about. Its too early. But we have a very strong leadershipsales leaders, delivery leaders and HCL has always boasted of strong leadership pipeline. I think, I am pretty comfortable with the momentum and we are pretty optimistic for the overall outlook.So, can I say that the COO position was created to help you transition to the CEO post?You can take it like that. It was a part of succession planning.You have chalked out a partnership with IBM. What gains are you expecting from this, considering that IBM is also a competitor?Competition is in certain space. In the IT space, there are lots of opportunities. They have a huge software business. So, there are good IPs that can be potentially looked at and thats what we have done. And then they are also a very large PaaS (platform-as-a-service) provider, like Bluemix is a big PaaS service. Some of our modern applications can be built on Microsoft Azure or IBM Bluemix.You have been defocusing on the India market. Will that continue?Yes, we are not focusing on the India market. It will continue to come down.With a 2.8% quarterly growth and a soft second half, will you be able to achieve the 12-14% target in 2016-17?We had a 6% revenue growth in the first quarter, we have 2.8% in the second quarter, so we are clear on what the run rate is. It is between 2% and 3% to get to the 12-14%. So far, from whatever we know, we feel confident to achieve that target.While many IT peers have hired outsiders in order to transform themselves, you are a 22-year company veteran. Do you feel confident to bring new ideas?Each core business has got very strong leadership. We continue to hire from outside also. So, it gives a good mix of external and internal view.

0.41,"Washington/New Delhi: Putting the heat on countries like India that corner substantial numbers of H1B and L1 work visas issued to IT professionals, senator Jeff Sessions, US president-elect Donald Trumps nominee for the post of attorney general, overnight, on Thursday said the new administration would push for legislative measures to curb the misuse of the two categories of visas. 
				   
				The comments come as Trump, in his first news conference as president-elect on Wednesday, promised a major punitive border tax on products manufactured by US companies shifting jobs outside the US, underlining that job creation at home would be one of his priorities.Previously, the US president-elect had listed immigration reform among five executive actions he plans to take on his first day in office. They include asking the Department of Labor to investigate all abuses of the visa programmes that undercut the American worker.Also read: The challenges to free movement of labourIn his confirmation hearing, Sessions said: Its simply wrong to think that were in a totally open world and that any American with a job can be replaced if somebody in the world is willing to take a job for less pay. We have borders. We have a commitment to our citizens and you have been a champion of that. Ive been honoured to work with you on it, Sessions said in response to a question from senator Charles Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.Under the H1B visa programme, US-based companies hire highly skilled foreign workers, up to a maximum of 85,000 a year65,000 hired abroad and 20,000 from among foreign nationals studying in the US.The H1B visas are used by companies hiring Indian techies while the L1 is used for intra-company transfers.  The multibillion-dollar Indian IT industrys exports are worth $108 billion, 60% of which goes to the US market.Also read: Trump effect? Bill targeting H1B visas reintroduced in US CongressIn New Delhi, Shivendra Singh, vice-president in charge of global trade development at the National Association of Software and Services Companies or Nasscom, said the trade body would work to dispel the perception that Indian IT professionals were eating into the US jobs market. The top seven Indian companies account for just 13% of the H1B and L1 visas issued every year, he said, adding that the rest are used by major US companies who hire Indian IT professionals.The fact is that the Indian IT sector is a net jobs creator in the US, Singh said. We support more than 400,000 jobs in the US, we contribute $20 billion as taxes to the US economy and we play a role in making America more competitive, he said.  Singh also cited the US Labor Department figures to buttress the argument that a shortage of skilled workers within the US labour pool was what was causing Indian as well as US companies to hire Indian IT professionals. According to Singh, the US Labor Department had itself predicted a shortage of 2.4 million STEM or science, technology, engineering and mathematics graduates till 2018. We want to hire locally but there is a shortage of skilled labour. This is why US companies are also hiring Indian workers, he said.If the H1B and LI visas are given on the basis of skill, then we are fine with that, he said. We are also supportive of US efforts to create more jobs, he said.With the US and India looking to boost trade from the current $100 billion to $500 billion (set by India and the US during a visit to New Delhi in 2013 by the outgoing US vice-president Joe Biden), Singh said the IT industry was seen as one of the key drivers of this.The Indian IT industry has in the past too been a target of  US politicians who blame it for taking away jobs.In 2015, during US president Barack Obamas second term in office, India had protested the increase in H1B and L1 visa fees from $2000 and $2,500 respectively to $4000 and $4500 respectively. The steep hikes were justified by the US administration to finance more security posts on the US-Mexico border and for the creation of a special fund for the victims of the 9/11 attacks in the US in 2001.Sessionss comments on the H1B and L1 visas come as two Republican lawmakers from California on 5 January re-introduced a bill in the US Congress that backs  key changes in the H1B programme, news reports said.

In this Star Wars space opera, Cyrus Mistry, the recently ousted chairman, was Sith Lord Darth Vader who had brainwashed the PR folk  the old and venerable conglomerates noble Jedi warriors  and used them to smother criticism of his performance.
				   
				Thats probably why a 24 September Economist report, titled Mistrys Elephant, which was denounced by the group for drawing preconceived conclusions based on an inappropriate interpretation of selected data, was on Thursday extolled by the same people for being really a well-balanced and critical review.Not just that.

How many episodes are left? Wheres the popcorn?The answer to the first is far from obvious. Ratan Tatas camp is now accusing Mistry of trying to hijack control of operating companies in the $100 billion salt-to-software conglomerate. Mistrys side says the allegations are untrue. Tata is mocking Mistrys poor leadership for botching up Tata Steel Ltds UK operations, claiming that the Scunthorpe steel plant it sold in May to Greybull Capital LLP for 1 British pound has since seen a dramatic turnaround. Mistry, on the other hand, blames Ratan Tatas $12.9 billion purchase of Corus Group Plcs steel assets in 2007 for the groups debt overhang.Tata Consultancy share-price declined 13% since Ratan returned . Since Ratan Tata is back only in an interim capacity, the group needs a new chairman to end the spat. But until Mistry agrees to sell his familys 18.4% holding in Tata Sons Ltd., the holding company, the lightsabers wont get turned off. Its unlikely that the CEO of a global corporation would want to jump into the fray as Luke Skywalkerand get his or her reputation fried in the process. Besides, after Tata Groups press statement accused Mistry of dismantling structures put in place by visionary founders and generations of Tatas, its not even clear if the group wants to be anything other than a family-run enterprise.Its a much more than just a war of words. Ratan Tata is trying to evict Mistry from the boards of operating companies, but its proving to be far from easy thanks to a few independent directors whore supporting Mistry. But are those directors taking up the cudgels to uphold corporate governance standards, or are they simply trying to avoid the embarrassment of firing a chairman after showering praises on him?Like in everything else with the Tata Wars, its impossible to establish whos with the Force and whos gone over to the Dark Side. Or for that matter, how many more episodes are left in the sordid saga. The best investors can hope for is that until the group makes up its mind on whether it wants to slash debt, gun for growth, or do a bit of both, Tata Consultancy Services , the groups ATM, will keep coughing up more cash so Bombay House can fully engage in the tussle for control. Thats the popcorn.

0.22,"Bengaluru: Wipro Ltd will spend $500 million to buy Appirio Inc., an Indianapolis, US-based cloud services firm, underlining the aggressive acquisition-based strategy Indias third largest software services firm has scripted for its transformation.
				   
				Appirio helps companies move applications to hosted servers offered by Amazon, Google and Salesforce.com.The privately held company, founded in 2006, has raised more than $110 million from investors including Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic, and counts Facebook, Home Depot and IBM as its clients. It is estimated to have revenue of more than $200 million.Wipro chief executive officer Abidali Z. Neemuchwala said it is important for companies to transform the way they engage with customers and employees by leveraging the power of the cloud. Since Neemuchwala joined the company in April last year, Wipro has spent $1.13 billion to buy four companies, including Appirio.Wipro spent $95 million in July 2015 to buy Denmark-based design firm Designit, with a revenue of $30 million, to give a boost to its newly created business division, Wipro Digital.In December, it paid $78 million to buy Cellent, a German technology company with over $90 million in revenue, that implements and maintains SAP software for clients in automobile and manufacturing segments. In February, Wipro paid $460 million to buy HealthPlan Services, a Florida, US-based technology firm that brings over $220 million in business by offering solutions to health insurance firms. Wipro also tried buying Viteos Group but later called off the buyout, citing inordinate delays in the completion of the acquisition. The Times of India first reported the Appirio deal.Wipros decision to buy Appirio mirrors the approach followed by its larger peers Accenture Plc. and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM). Accenture bought Salesforce partner, Cloud Sherpas in September last year while IBM bought Salesforce partner Bluewolf Group in April this year.This deal is about giving Wipro the capabilities to scale out IT services in the cloud world. What it gains are some strong methodologies in delivering in the cloud, and  significant partnerships such as Workday, Salesforce, Amazon, and Google, said Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm.More importantly, Wipro can take those methodologies and scale out to adjust for building revenue in the cloud. Every vendor is trying to figure out how to scale out cloud services and make money. Appirio and its chief competitor Blue Wolf have been the pioneers in this field.Cloud computing poses a threat to companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Wipro, whose customers  have started to use hosted servers. This means system integrators no longer just lose business in buying hardware and writing software needed for large data centres but even lose out in revenue which comes from maintaining the applications which move to hosted servers. The applications which moved to the hosted servers offered by Amazon and Microsoft use artificial intelligence and automation platform technologies which can be managed by  significantly fewer engineers.

0.6,"London:  Ashish Thakkar, who co-founded Africa banking conglomerate Atlas Mara Ltd with ex-Barclays Plc. head Bob Diamond, is a 35-year-old billionaire whose divorce fight has been prolonged, thanks to a complex web of offshore assets. 
				   
				The question of how much Thakkar is worthhe says $541,000 while his wife claims his wealth is far greateris coming under scrutiny in a UK divorce court. A judge in the London family court has denied Thakkars request for a final divorce decree until a determination of his real worth.This is a case where the wife says her husband is a billionaire, judge Philip Moor said in the ruling that shows the difficulty courts have in making a fair assessment of wealth. All the assets are offshore. They are held in very complicated structures that have changed within the recent past. The situation is one where it can be very significant if you are a wife or a former wife.The judges ruling, which was handed down in June and published on the courts website last week, extends a legal battle over the less than five-year marriage that has cast a spotlight on the entrepreneur, whose own foundation has promoted him as Africas youngest billionaire.Financial puzzlesUK judges have become used to unpicking complex webs of offshore assets in high-stakes divorces as spouses sometimes plead net worth far less than what the other spouse claims is their actual fortune. The forensic tracing of assets is a problem that has played out in other scenarios judges have faced across the world from tax avoidance schemes to fraud prosecutions.Based on his disclosed public and closely held assets, Thakkars net worth is valued at $425 million, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His most valuable asset is Ison BPO (Business Process Outsourcing), a UAE-based outsourcing company that operates in Africa and India.Lawyers for Meera Thakkar declined to comment as did a spokesman for Ashish Thakkar. Thakkars lawyers didnt respond to a call seeking comment. In court filings, Thakkar has argued that the beneficiaries of his companies are his mother and sister.While the Thakkar case is at the London high court, similar issues have reached the countrys top court before. The ex-wife of oil trader Michael Prest won a Supreme Court ruling giving her the right to force offshore companies owned by her ex-husband to turn over assets as part of a 17.5 million-pound settlement in 2013. Prests lawyers argued at the time that the courts had no right to pierce the corporate veil of his companies to fund the settlement as they were separate entities and unrelated to the marriage.He was later threatened with up to four weeks in jail for failing to pay his ex-wife 360,000 pounds in 2015 despite his assets being estimated by the judge to be in the region of 37 million pounds.Allegations of hiding assets in divorce cases is nothing new and UK judges have wide discretion to set values as they see fit, according to Graham Coy, a lawyer at Stowe Family Law, who isnt involved in the Thakkar case.If someone is determined to try and hide their assets it is possible, but they could still end up being clobbered in the end anyway because a judge can just take a view on how much theyre worth and if they dont like it, prove it, Coy said.The ex-wife of a property magnate Scot Young told a London judge in one of the highest profile divorce cases in recent years that Young was hiding billions from her while he claimed he was about 28 million pounds in debt.The judge said in the 2013 ruling that Young wasnt a penniless man of straw with huge debts, and that hed hidden from the court about 40 million pounds in assets. Young fell to his death from a fourth-floor window of his flat in London in late 2014.The Supreme Court rolled back two divorce settlements in a 2015 decision that underlined Londons claim to be the divorce capital of the world. The top court ruled two ex-wives are entitled to larger divorce settlements because their husbands hid their true wealth, the decision could pave the way for previous divorce agreements to be revisited many years after they were agreed.Adventures in AfricaThakkars story began in Idi Amins Uganda. His family was among Asian families the dictator expelled in 1972, and moved to the UK, where Thakkar was born. They returned to Africa when he was a child, this time to Rwanda, where his family lost everything during the genocide in 1994, Thakkar says in his 2015 autobiography, The Lion Awakes: Adventures in Africas Economic Miracle.Thakkars own success has prompted him to be branded Africas youngest billionaire. Hes described that way in a 2013 video on a YouTube channel for his charity, the Mara Foundation. He is introduced as that at conferences and asked about it in media interviews.At 15, after the family had returned to Uganda, Thakkar sold a laptop to his dads friend, triggering the realization he could be a trader. His father gave him $5,000 start-up cash, and he started flying to Dubai to buy cheap computer products, which he sold from a tiny shop in central Kampala.He expanded his business by setting up a Dubai-based company. He later started a packaging factory in Uganda and partnered with an Indian Information Technology services company to help them gain entry in new markets across Africa, according to his websites.Thakkar and Diamond met at an event, hit it off and decided that they could start a banking venture together. Thakkar remains a non-executive director with Atlas Mara, which he and Diamond founded with the idea of buying up stakes in banks across sub-Saharan Africa. The company, domiciled in the British Virgin Islands, has raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors through share offerings since 2013.Its important to think big, dream big, but start small, Thakkar says in interviews and speeches. I dont want to bring Silicon Valley to Africa.

0.94,"New Delhi: The quest for energy efficiency is transforming Indias Rs15,000 crore a year market for lighting systems. Conventional lamps are being replaced by efficient ones starting from simple LED (light emitting diode) bulbs to sophisticated movement-detecting lighting systems for smart cities and businesses, opening up a host of opportunities to lighting companies from the very bottom of the pyramid to high-end consumers. Harshavardhan Chitale, vice-chairman and managing director of Philips Lighting India Ltd, speaks to Mint about the industrys changing dynamics.
				   
				Edited excerpts from the interview:What is your strategy for growth in India?
We have actively contributed to improving the health of power distribution companies with energy savings. Lighting as a whole contributes to 18-20% of total power consumption in the country. To bridge our energy deficit, we need to either increase power generation or reduce the need for power itself, through energy efficiency. If the entire lighting system of the country is converted into efficient LED lighting or smart connected lighting, our total lighting-related power demand will get reduced by half. It frees up about 30 gigawatt (GW) of our over 300GW generation capacity. That more than bridges our peak power deficit, which is the result of increased power consumption for lighting at peak hours.Secondly, in spite of the drive to electrify all the villages, there will always be parts of India where providing grid-connected power is not economical, as the cost of laying wire will be much more than the cost of power generation. About 20 crore people, or four to five crore households in the country, have either no access to power or get only intermittent supply. Making energy-efficient lighting, especially those run on solar power, available to them will solve our energy access problem.What are the growth opportunities that energy efficiency offers to companies like yours in urban areas?
Home lighting, lights used by businesses and organizations and infrastructure and street lighting are the three major areas of power consumption. India has about three crore street lamps which remain lit for about 10 hours a day, which is a major segment of consumption. For businesses, upgrading to energy-efficient lighting offers a high return on their investment by way of savings in power bill. Payback period for upgrading all lighting systems ranges between two and three years. Almost three-fourth of all new lights bought by businesses are energy-efficient LED lights. There is also a trend among businesses to go for smart lighting, which can sense movement of people and the number of people in the surrounding and produce light accordingly. This intelligent lighting offers about 30% of energy saving in addition to the 50% saving that LEDs per se offer. Some organizations are now getting into what is called managed services. That is, companies like ours upgrade their lighting infrastructure and they pay us in instalments for using that infrastructure. Their savings from power bills helps them pay their instalments to the service provider. Manufacturing companies as well as information technology firms, which are very familiar with the concept of managed services, are going for this.Is smart lighting of streets catching up?
Many states have started to adopt efficient street lamps because of the Smart City initiative, but a lot more is to be done. India has 5,000 towns and at least 100 large cities and three crore street lights. Some cities have upgraded to connected smart street lights. One example is Naya Raipur, the new capital of Chhattisgarh. This city has probably the worlds most modern connected lighting infrastructure that is monitored remotely. The city engineer monitors the infrastructure from his office. If a bulb needs replacement, it gets reported automatically. We are also upgrading the lighting infrastructure of many cities in Tamil Nadu, including Chennai. Finances of the state and the municipalities concerned are important in going for an upgrade. The upgrade is quicker where the municipality concerned has a clear financial model such as central government funding or multilateral aid or lending. Besides energy saving, the cost of maintenance for efficient lights is less and the quality of light is also better.In overseas markets, especially in Europe, we have executed projects where lights remain dim when there is no one in the street and the light intensity goes up when movement of people or vehicle is detected. Indian cities have not gone for this level of sophistication, but the journey has started.The government promotes LED bulbs in a big way. Has it captured the market for home lighting?
In the consumer segment, about 30% of the lights sold today are LED bulbs and the rest are conventional bulbs. The large market share that conventional bulbs still enjoy is not because of any price advantage, but because they are more easily available in the neighbourhood. Its a question of distribution. Some of the LED options are cheaper than conventional bulbs. We need to address this.How can this be tackled?
Firstly, the products that should be adopted have to be of high quality and should be designed for the domestic market with high voltage fluctuation tolerance. Use of poor-quality products can sabotage the adoption of LED bulbs as it would adversely affect public perception of the benefits of energy-efficient products. The next wave of LED adoption will get supported by a robust retailing ecosystem. We go to a nearby retailer to replace a bulb, not to a power distribution utility that stocks these products. The total lighting market in India as per industry estimates is Rs15,000 crore a year. This excludes new pockets of demand such as the remote areas where solar-powered LED bulbs would be required.More than 93% of the lighting equipment that Philips sells in India is designed for India and is made in India.",2016-09-20,woGw5FGjDjQubIV5AEkyaP,"Philips Lighting India MD Harshavardhan Chitale on the lighting industrys changing dynamics

-0.06,"Undoubtedly, it was under A.M. Naiks stewardship that Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) earned a pride of place in the Indian equity markets.
				   
				From the time he took over the reins as chairman and managing director in 2003 and until date, L&Ts market capitalization has surged three times to Rs.1.425 trillion. This implies a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25%, which surpasses the 21% CAGR in the MCap index of BSE 100 companies during the period. Not just this. L&Ts stock, which trades at Rs.1,519, is reckoned by analysts, brokers and investors as the best play on the economy.The first major decision in his 13-year old journey at L&Ts helm to sell its cement business to the Aditya Birla group in lieu of the equity stake held by them in the firm, was creditable. For, it marked the end of takeover threats by big industrial groups and established greater employee and public shareholding. It also ended its presence in its only commodity playcement. Importantly, it marked L&Ts transition from a sizeable engineering and cement conglomerate into an indomitable edifice spanning several businesses such as hydrocarbons, heavy engineering, finance and information technology (IT).That said, L&Ts key focus area remains infrastructure, engineering and construction that today comprises about 45% of its revenue, compared with 83% from engineering and construction way back in 2004.Some analysts have been critical of Naiks diversification into unrelated areas such as finance and information technology (IT), though others consider these as cash-accretive businesses that would provide a hedge against economic recession.Proof of this was seen in the companys financial results during the last two years, when profit growth in the infrastructure segment dropped to single digits. Overall profitability got a leg-up from IT and financial services that did well and helped buck an economic slowdown.Again, Naiks decision to enter these businesses can be lauded in that the two recently announced public issues of L&T Infotech Ltd and L&T Technology Services will help unlock shareholder value as the money deployed in these businesses generates good returns.Further, Naik leaves behind a legacy of not just diverse businesses but diverse markets, too. From a pure domestic infrastructure firm a little over a decade ago, L&T is now present in new markets, such as West Asia. Today, almost one-third of its annual order inflows come from overseas, offsetting the slow pace of infrastructure development and order inflows in the country.Of course, in West Asia, the firms timing was perhaps wrong as the crude oil price crash stymied expansions in this region.L&Ts strength lies not just in diversification, but also in attaining size and scale in its businesses, enough to compete well.From FY03 till FY16, L&Ts consolidated revenue has grown at a CAGR of 19% to touch Rs.1.026 trillion. Growth in profit after tax has been even better at 23% CAGR.That said, sustaining fixed costs and overheads in the face of an economic slowdown is challenging. This is mirrored in its operating margin that has slowly started trending lower from 13-14% about a decade ago and is unlikely to improve in the near term.That apart, L&T could boast of a sizeable order book, enough to generate revenue for the next two years. But then, its balance sheet is also weighed down by the same. Economic slowdown and project delays due to tight liquidity conditions among customers has led to a surge in working capital requirements that is one-fourth its net revenue.The change of guard comes with huge challenges, too. Through Naiks tenure, L&T has been unable to churn out profits from some businesses. Its shipbuilding, heavy forgings, hydrocarbons, power and road subsidiaries are either loss-making or have wafer-thin profits.The scene is far from cushy in developmental projects that include roads, ports, bridges and urban infrastructure. For example, the FY16 annual report shows that while its road projects clocked single-digit revenue growth, high interest costs and depreciation translated into losses.The street is also concerned about the Hyderabad Metro project, mired in clearance hurdles and delays. It is likely to bleed once it is fully operational and weigh on L&Ts overall profitability.A Religare Capital Markets report says that decisions of capital misallocations in the recent past may not be addressed in the expected timelines. If so, it would tell on profitability. Meanwhile, analysts feel that FY17 will mirror the full impact of the new accounting (Ind-AS) norms, which could hurt profit growth given the more stringent provisions required.Be that as it may, Naiks successor is faced with the task of precariously balancing the juggernaut, until macroeconomic winds turn more favourable.",2016-09-09,x0cXVktXgElid8CsJZMZpL,"AM Naiks successor is faced with the task of precariously balancing the juggernaut, until macroeconomic winds turn more favourable

0.54,"The Tamil Nadu of the 1980s was a pioneer in the field of technical educationnot so much in terms of what was being taught, but where and how. That was the decade the state government decided to allow private engineering colleges. Tamil Nadu wasnt the only state to do so. Around the same time, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh also decided to allow private engineering colleges.
				   
				The motive for all states was the sameto address the demand-supply gap.This was particularly acute in Tamil Nadu, where 69% reservation meant anyone from the so-called forward castes, who wanted to be an engineer, had either the intelligence or the economic wherewithal, or both, to secure admission to a top government engineering college (The College of Engineering, Guindy, was at the top); an Indian Institute of Technology; College of Engineering Roorkee; BITS  Pilani; or the Regional Engineering College (REC), Trichy.ALSO READ | How N. Chandrasekaran became Tata Sons chairmanBy the middle of that decade, enough private engineering colleges had emerged. By then, young people wanting to be engineers in the state had discovered software services companies (or rather, software services companies had discovered them). The demand for computer science soared among students seeking admission to engineering colleges.Even with the increase in supply, there still wasnt enough to go around. Companies such as NIIT Ltd and Aptech Ltd thrived on the surplus and also on demand from science (even commerce and arts) graduates who wanted to do computers, so as to land a job with a software services company. Loath to be left behind, government universities and private colleges decided to offer a masters programme in computer applications, called MCA. The main objective was to target graduates in other disciplines who would otherwise end up with a private computer education institute.N. Chandrasekaran, who was named chairman of Tata Sons on 12 January, was a beneficiary of this. He joined Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) after completing his MCA from REC Trichy.That was in 1987, by when Chennai had already emerged as home to one of TCSs biggest development centres (on what the city still obstinately called Cathedral Road, although the government had long ago renamed it Dr Radhakrishnan Road after one of the countrys presidents). Interestingly, the TCS office was almost strategically locatedright next to the US consulate. Back then, anyone who joined TCS wanted to be sent to the US on an assignment. Many succeeded. Chennai was well on its way to becoming a city of parents. But thats another story.ALSO READ | Tata Sons new chairman has twin obstaclesa family and a conglomerateChandrasekaran isnt from Chennai. He was born in Mohanur in Namakkal district (famous for poultry farms) and studied in a local Tamil medium school till Class X. Although he didnt go to engineering college (he graduated in applied sciences from Coimbatore), he must have been aware of what was happening around him (and also from his two elder brothers, N. Srinivasan and N. Ganapathy Subramaniam). Back in the 1980s, it was hard to be a student in Tamil Nadu and not get caught up in the whole computer thing. And when Chandrasekaran completed his MCA from REC Trichy, he went to work in TCSs Cathedral Road office. Interestingly, his brother N. Ganapathy Subramaniam was already working for TCS then (and still does).Sure, Chandrasekarans career really took off after he served as then chief executive S. Ramadorais executive assistant for a couple of years in the late 1990s, but it would be unfair to ignore the other factors that have contributed to his success: his own abilities; an environment that encouraged computer literacy (actually, proficiency); colleges that offered the right kind of courses; and the deeply meritocratic nature of the IT industry.Interestingly, Chandrasekaran wasnt the only beneficiary of this. Nor were all the beneficiaries Tamilian Brahmins (or tam-brahms for short; Chandrasekaran is one), although that was the community at the vanguard of the first great westward migration by Indian IT professionals. In pre-dominantly Brahmin parts of Chennai, such as T. Nagar and Adyar and Mylapore, the joke in the 1980s (and the early 1990s) was that every family had to give at least one child to Uncle Sam.ALSO READ | The many challenges of Natarajan ChandrasekaranThanks to the 69% reservation and the increase in both demand for and supply of software engineers, almost everyone benefited. Thanks to IT, Tamil Nadus affirmative action actually worked, perhaps one reason why the states social indicators are healthy.In the mid-1980s Tamil Nadu (and Chennai, which was still Madras), it was clear that if one wanted a job one should do computers.And through the 1990s, the 2000s, and perhaps the 2010s (although the last is arguable), it was clear that IT companies were among the best managed in the country. They had to be. Their clients were usually Western corporations with high benchmarks, and their success meant they were tracked extensivelysometimes obsessivelyby analysts.It is, therefore, in the fitness of things that a young man from Mohanur who did computers and then worked in an IT company, gets a shot at managing one of the largest conglomerates in the land.Chandrasekarans success is that of the Indian IT Everymans.R.

Mistry and letting of bad blood ever since. Popularly known as Chandra, the 54-year-old will take charge at the helm of $103-billion Tata Sons, the main holding company of the salt-to-software conglomerate from 21 February. He will be the first non-Parsi chairman of the 150-year old Tata Group. Chandrasekaran was the CEO and MD of Tata Consultancy Services, the cash-cow for the group, since 2009. A Tata lifer, he had joined the company in 1987. He was appointed as a director on the board of Tata Sons on 24 October 2016, just a day after Mistrys removal as chairman. Ratan Tata was appointed as the interim chairman of Tata Sons while a five-member panel was formed to search for a successor. Chandrasekaran has said the responsibility of his new assignment would require binding the Group together (and its) the three-tier structure with the phenomenal work that Tata Truststhe majority holders of Tata Sonshas done very silently over a century in contributing to the society.

0.82,"Bengaluru: At Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), the protracted period of subpar growth continued as Indias largest technology outsourcing firm reported a 0.3% dollar revenue growth, marginally higher than Street expectations, in the October-December period.
				   
				TCS, which ended with $16.5 billion in revenue last year, has grown more than 3% on a sequential basis in a quarter only three times since October 2014. Worryingly, over these past nine quarters, it last reported an over 10% year-on-year growth only once, in the January-March 2015 period.Mumbai-based TCS saw a 0.3% rise in dollar revenue from the preceding three months, and was up 5.8% from the year-ago period to $4.379 billion in the quarter to December. In rupee terms, third-quarter revenue rose 1.5% to Rs29,735 crore from the preceding three months. In constant currency terms, TCS reported a 2% growth, on account of generating more business from its banking clients in the US.TCSs quarterly profit rose 1.6% sequentially to $1 billion, up 8% from $926 million in the year-ago period.A Bloomberg survey of analysts had estimated the firm to report Rs6,432 crore ($947.49 million) profit on net sales of 29610.5 crore ($4.36 billion).The companys operating margin was 26%, similar to what it was at the end of the July-September period. The management reiterated its commitment to end the year in its stated guidance of 26-28% operating margin.It was a very good quarter, considering traditionally Q3 has a weak demand, said Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chief executive officer, TCS, who is set to take over as chairman of holding company Tata Sons on 21 February. I dont expect Q4 to be anything different than in the past. As of now, based on what information I have, I believe it (Q4) should be on expected lines.Chandrasekaran downplayed concerns over a clamp down on H-1B visas, critical to software firms such as TCS, in the context of the new administration in the US and said the company is well prepared to cope with any increase in wages for its US employees or a lowering of the visa ceiling.I cannot comment on the margin impact; but since 2015, we have been preparing ourselves to work in a visa-constrained environment. So I dont think there will be any impact on us, said Chandrasekaran. Earlier this month, a legislation demanding that outsourcing firms pay at least $100,000 a year to employees who work in the US was introduced in the US Congress.TCS does not give a quarterly or yearly guidance, and the companys underperformance in the nine months of the current year means it will at-best report a 6% dollar revenue growth, lower than the 7.1% growth reported last year.TCS has added $786 million in incremental revenue from April to December this year against $783 million in new business in the first nine months of 2015-16. Significantly, for the first time since TCS went public in 2004, its annual growth will be less than or at best on par with Accenture Plc., which is double the size of the Mumbai-based firm. Accenture grew 6% in the year to August last year (Accenture follows September-August as financial year), helped by  15 acquisitions , which brought 2 percentage points of overall 10.5% constant currency growth. TCS has shied away from buying companies.It is status quonothing materially different than the second quarter. It is important to note that expectations are already so low that even if the company meets the low end of these expectations, it is considered to be a decent show, said a Mumbai-based analyst at a domestic brokerage, on condition of anonymity.At the heart of TCSs underperformance is its inability to build a stronger consulting practice and the managements reluctance to buy small hi-tech firms. TCS also faces some client-specific challenges. Nonetheless, TCS said its digital business in the third quarter rose 6.6% on a sequential basis and 30.2% over the year-ago period to $737 million, or 16.8% of its quarterly revenue.Its revenue from banking, financial services and insurance firms, which accounts for 40% of total revenue, reported a 2.1% increase in constant currency terms. TCS reported a 2.2% improvement in the US, which accounts for 55% of total revenue. Revenue growth in the UK, which brings about 13.3% of total business, rose 1.7%, while the India business, which brings about 6.3% of revenue, jumped 10.3%.TCS managed to retain more employees in the quarter, as attrition for IT services stood at 11.3% and including back office unit (BPO business), attrition was 12.2%. Shares of TCS rose 0.87% to Rs2,343 on BSE on Thursday, while the benchmark Sensex rose 0.39% to 27, 247 points.The results were disclosed after the markets closed.",2017-01-12,y5EWGSFJ6cRDGp7gSgCXRJ,"Tata Consultancy Servicess revenue in dollar terms grew 0.3%, sequentially, and increased 5.8% from a year ago",16:15,"TCS Q3 profit rises 8% to $1 billion, beats forecasts"

				The dynastic business that built a reputation over more than a century for discretion, integrity and fair-dealing has sunk into a public spat of allegations and name-calling. Its directors trade barbs. Its share price is tumbling. And on Friday, executives were jostled in the street while security staff engaged in an unseemly brawl outside Bombay House, the groups revered headquarters.How did it come to this?The drama dissecting Tata Sons, Indias largest industrial group, revolves around Ratan Tata, scion of a family that built an empire so diverse that it writes financial software for Goldman Sachs Group Inc., sells pick-up trucks in Uganda and offers packaged salt to Indian families at Rs.18 a kilo.Two weeks ago, Ratan Tata threw the group into confusion and the public spotlight after the Tata Sons board sacked his successor as chairman, Cyrus Mistry, and wrested back control for the 78-year-old. Neither Tata nor any other board member or major investor has suggested that Mistry financially mismanaged the group. He remains head of many of the affiliate companies, such as Tata Motors and Tata Steel.Instead, Mistrys ouster was the result of growing discontent from Tata, who ran the company for two decades, at what he considered was an undermining of the Tata brand, according to people who have worked with both and asked not to be named because the matter is private.Egos have been bruised, said Harsh Goenka, chairman of RPG Group, another Mumbai-based conglomerate. He said the Tata name stands for humility, humaneness, benevolence, grace and boldness of vision, and it has been dented by the current conflict.Since Mistrys removal as group chairman, Tatas more than two dozen listed companies have lost in excess of $8 billion in market value. Ratan Tata didnt respond to a recent request for an interview.Brand TataTatas adherence to the idea of the brand being a byword for integrity has run throughout his career, according to interviews with more than a dozen people who have worked with him. Banks would routinely do business based on Tatas word, and once he committed to doing something, he would see it through no matter what, said a person with knowledge of some of his deals.When Tata Steel bid for Corus Plc in 2006, it arranged financing with three banks for around $5 billion to $6 billion, said the person, who asked not to be named because the negotiations were private. As the price rose in a bidding war for the European steelmaker, Tata officials found cheaper funding, but would have to pay a break fee with the original banks of about £80 million ($99 million). Some executives tried to negotiate a cheaper release, but when the matter was brought to the attention of Ratan Tata, he insisted the original contract be honoured, the person said.Tatas decision echoes the groups current spat with Japanese telecommunication partner NTT Docomo Inc., which is one of the key battlegrounds in the war of words between Tata and Mistry. Docomo is trying to enforce a London Court of International Arbitration decision ordering Tata Sons to pay $1.17 billion for failing to uphold a contract, signed during Ratan Tatas 21-year period at the helm.A Tata Sons spokesman declined to comment while Mistrys office referred to a 1 November statement on the companys partnership with NTT Docomo.Tata became frustrated at Mistrys seeming reluctance to pay, which reflected on the Tata name, according to people familiar with the case. In an email to the directors after his removal, Mistry said it was the board that has not covered itself with glory, by the way he was dismissed.Family codeBut the Tata family code, rigorously pursued by Ratan Tatas predecessor, the legendary industrialist, aviator and philanthropist J.R.D. Tata, extends far beyond just sticking to your word.J.R.D., whose portrait looked down from the boardroom wall in Bombay House as Mistry was being ousted, made Tata famous for refusing to pay bribes. He founded many of the businesses that are now key units, such as Tata Motors, and funnelled a large chunk of profits to social programs such as Asias first cancer hospital and the Tata Institute for Social Sciences.He handpicked Ratan, the great grandson via his adopted father of group founder Jamsetji Tata, to carry on that family legacy. Trained as an architect at Cornell University, Ratan began on the shop floor in 1962, stoking Tata Steels blast furnaces, before gaining experience in several positions in the group.In 1991, he took over the chairmanship and set about establishing his dominance over group companies, which had become rich and autonomous during J.R.D.s five-decade reign.In the 1990s the Tata Group was ruled by powerful satraps and he very dexterously distanced all of them from their powerful positions and gained total control, said Goenka, chairman of RPG. The one common factor that defines Ratan Tata then and now is that of an astute leader. He eased out Cyrus Mistry from the chairmanship that took India Inc. completely by surprise. If the past was about a loud war cry, the present is about stealth.During his first chairmanship, Tata expanded the company rapidly, often by acquisition, turning a predominately India business into a global group with $103 billion in salesahead of Gazprom and International Business Machines Corp. He also sowed the seeds for many of the groups current troubles, including the purchase of Corus, the venture with Docomo and the ill-fated Nano car project.Since about 2004, with the question of his succession looming, Tata gradually increased his control in the operations of the group, said a person who worked closely with both Mistry and Tata. He took major decisions with less board consultation than previously, the person said.Ratan Tata has always consulted senior executives in all his decisions, including the Corus acquisition, said a Tata official, who asked not to be identified citing company rules.New successorThe eventual choice for a successor was Mistry, the son of one of the biggest shareholders in Tata Sons, his own brother-in-law and a fellow member of the Parsi communitythe isolated followers of Zoroastrianism whose ancestors fled to India from Persia a millennium ago.With Mistry deposed, Tata is back at the helm promising to find a new successor before March. Next month he will be 79.I do not think Ratan Tata has any option other than to hold on to the position that he has taken back, whether he likes it or not, said Kavil Ramachandran, executive director of the Thomas Schmidheiny Centre for Family Enterprise at the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad. In the interest of every stakeholder, he has to take steps to get the situation back on track.While Ratan took the groups products to more than 100 countries, he retained the ethos of his predecessors, that in building a business you are also helping to build India.Nano InspirationThe Nano was inspired by seeing an Indian family riding on a motorbike in the rain. It epitomized Ratan Tatas qualitieshis vision and attention to detail, as well as his stubbornness and reluctance to terminate a key business thats losing money.Tata spent hours with the Nano development team, focusing on getting every detail right for the most anticipated auto release of 2008, said a person who worked on the project. Yet the car was marketed as cheap, a stigma that was reinforced by dealers who had little interest in pushing a low-margin vehicle.When Mistry led the introduction of Tata Motors latest modelthe unfortunately named Zica hatchback, rechristened Tiagohis main concern was how to ensure the car would be profitable, according to the person who worked with both Mistry and Tata, and asked not to be identified as hes not authorized to speak to the media. Mistry talked to staff about what he, and even his children, thought of the marketing campaign and what needed fixing, the employee said.Ratan Tatas vision for the group was a globally diversified and successful conglomerate with some distinctive values, said Rishikesha T. Krishnan, director and professor of strategic management at the Indian Institute of Management Indore. Cyrus Mistry did not dismantle that vision, but he appears to have been particularly concerned about the viability of different businesses.If something went wrong, Tata would tell you to your face and then take immediate steps to rectify the problem, said a senior Tata Sons executive who has known Ratan Tata for more than two decades. He described Tata as a humanist with a deep sense of compassion, who was keen on products that fostered social justice like the Nano, or Tata Salt.In 2012, after grooming Mistry for the top job for a year, Tata stepped down as group chairman, and moved from his relatively modest apartment to a white, three-story house he built on the seafront near the exclusive Colaba neighbourhood of Mumbai, with a private gym and rooftop infinity pool looking out over the Arabian Sea, according to local newspaper reports.Start-up InvestingHe threw his energies into working with entrepreneurs, investing nominal sums in more than three dozen startups ranging from artificial intelligence to online sales of womens lingerie.Those who met him spoke of his imposing presence, graciousness and attention to detail in how ideas would work.Mr Tata. listens intently, has a curiosity to learn and often gives a fresh perspective that hasnt been considered, said Vani Kola, head of venture capital fund Kalaari Capital. He notices the smallest things, he puts people at ease.At the same time, he continued to keep any eye on the Tata Group as head of the powerful family trusts that hold a majority stake in Tata Sons. According to several people who know Tata, he became increasingly frustrated by what was happening to the company that bore his name.On 24 October, before the board meeting in Bombay House, where stray dogs are allowed to roam the corridors, Mistry was told of the decision to remove him.Cyrus Mistry was handpicked by Ratan Tata, said Goenka. This time he will look for someone who understands the Tata culture and the Tata way of doing things, better. Bloomberg",2016-11-08,ylJCy9morUM9QsY5DRkqhN,"Tata group, the dynastic business that built a reputation over more than a century for discretion, integrity and fair-dealing has sunk into a public spat of allegations and name-calling",11:24,Ratan Tatas return as interim chairman seen taking toll on Brand Tata
