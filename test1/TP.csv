0.25,"Ahmedabad: Billionaire Gautam Adani, chairman of the Adani Group, talks about the companys $16 billion coal project in Australia in an interview after winning a series of court battles that once threatened to derail the controversial mining project.
ALSO READ | Gautam Adani says debt level not a concern, eyes new sectorsThe Gujarat-based businessman also discusses his plans for solar, the next sunrise sectors for the group, the changing Indian economic scenario, compensatory tariff issues for its thermal power plants and the Adani Sagar Mala, a string of ports across the country. Edited excerpts:After much delay, your plans to build one of the worlds largest coal mines in Australia seems back on track with the recent court rulings being in your favour and the Australian government extending full support to the project. How do you see your Australian dreams unfolding? Also, you have faced similar resistance from environmental groups in India too in the past. What do you find in common in the two?After four long years of approval processes and unnecessary  struggles in courts, we have finally overcome the hurdles and we hope to take it to our board (Adani Enterprises) for final investment decisions by March. The Carmichael mine, rail and port project includes the development of a world-class mine with phase one production of 25 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) in FY21. This includes 388-km standard gauge multi-user railway line of 60 mtpa capacity and related port expansions. The coal from this mine would be used to fire our power projects in Mundra and Udupi.The recent successful meeting with Australian federal, state and regional leaders not only enhanced our confidence but also has paved the way for enhancing trade multi-fold between the two nations.The much-needed infrastructure for the project will open up the Galilee Basin and put Australia in a competitive position in a global sea-borne market. The total life of mine capex is about $16 billion and we would have invested about $4.5 billion in the first phase.Now, coming to the other part, I will tell you that we remain fully committed and very confident of the environmental impact studies we commission and all this information is public. Be it India or Australia or any other country, the impact studies we do are world-class and we use consultants of global repute to augment our very strong internal team.There have been several positive recent court outcomes in Australia that rejected the claims of what are largely activist-inspired appeals and uphold the strong approvals process by the governments in Australia that we have complied with. These activist-motivated appeals are at odds with the strong local community support in the regions the projects are based. So, the court wins provide more confidence around the project time-frames for Adani and meeting demand in India as well as for the supporting communities in Australia.Just like any other company in our sector, there will always be some resistance for different reasons and its a part of our business to be able to address these in a transparent and scientific manner.There are both differences and similarities between activist activities in the two nations. Increasingly these are political campaigns with wider objectives and often with funding and support by global NGOs. Regrettably, these campaigns often dont recognize that in many respects, India and Adani are at the forefront of finding the right balance between our leadership on renewable energy and the fact that our developing economy also needs the affordable thermal energy that many other nations still rely on for their base load.We continue to look for opportunities in mining sector across the globe as we aspire to be world leaders in the integrated pit-to-plug strategy in our energy vertical. It includes mines, rail and port developments.You seem to have got a clear ambition to be a dominant player in the sectors that you venture into, be it ports, power, mining or the more recently forayed renewable energy business. What is the next sunrise sector for you?It is important to understand that for a growth economy like India, even our core sectors of ports, power (including solar) and mining remain sunrise sectors, given the sheer potential ahead. All you need to do is to look at China and see what they have done over the past 25 years to be able to realize that the real period of growth for India within our core sectors is still ahead of us. A 7+% GDP (gross domestic product) growth rate and the strong policy advocacy that we are seeing from the government will provide the additional tail wind for companies like us to keep growing our business at healthy double-digit rates.That being said, we are certainly evaluating other sectors that include coal conversions, defence and water. However, its too early to say which of these would be the next sunrise sector for us.Solar seems to have taken a top priority for the group in recent times. You have also set up the worlds largest solar plant in Tamil Nadu.Solar indeed has taken a significant priority and is a great example of how rapidly we capitalize on opportunities. Over the past 18 months, we have built a confirmed pipeline of 2,000MW of solar power, commissioned the worlds largest solar plant in Tamil Nadu in a record period of nine months.We have a target of contributing 10% of capacity in the national target under Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) of 100,000MW of grid-connected solar power by 2022. Accordingly, we aim to set up 10,000MW of solar power plants and at least 10,000MW of solar parks during this period. One has to remember that ultimately, the speed of learning cycles and the execution experience makes all the difference and at this time, we are doing this perhaps faster than any other player in the world. In Australia too, we have focused plans to enter the renewable energy sector.You have announced $1 billion for a solar panels and solar cells production facility. What kind of opportunity do you see in solar manufacturing for an Indian company?We are in the process of commissioning a 1.2GW, Indias largest integrated solar manufacturing facility, to produce polysilicon, ingots, wafers, cells and modules and ancillary products under Make in India initiative at Mundra (Gujarat) in multiple phases.One has to understand that under the JNNSM programme, we are talking about establishing a 100GW solar generation capacity by 2022. No country in the world has ever accelerated their solar programmes at the pace this government has set out to do. India is set to become one of the leaders in the world in renewable energy generation in the days to come. Indian solar power market is expected to grow at CAGR of more than 60% for next five to 10 years. With solar tariffs coming in grid parity with that of thermal power and going forward is expected to come down further, future energy demand will be met from the solar projects.Currently, Indian solar manufacturing is inefficient compared to some international markets due to many reasons like obsolete and inflexible units of existing manufacturers, lack of economy of scale, dependence on imported raw material, etc. Large scale, end to end, vertically integrated solar manufacturing facility like that at Mundra will have a significant edge over currently established cell and module manufacturing units in India and can easily compete with worlds leading producers. Yes, there will be competition, but one has to recognize that we must have the confidence that the only way we can be a major player in the solar area is to be able to compete across the solar value chain using global benchmarks and therefore we need to use our integrated strategy as a differentiator.There were reports about your talks to take over some assets of Sun Edison in India. What is the current status? We evaluate various business opportunities continuously. Lot of projects in India, which were aggressively bid out, are in market looking for buyers/investors. Some of these were just taken to be later sold to potential buyers before or soon after the development. We looked at some of the assets but then decided that it made more sense to organically develop the businessat least as of now. As regards Sun Edison, we heard from media reports that Greenko is in advanced stage of discussions.Moving from solar, tell us what is happening in thermal power projects. The fluctuating coal prices and compensation tariff have been a concern for the company for quite some time now.From the very beginning, our goal has been to generate 20,000MW by 2020. Indian power sector has witnessed rapid advancement over the past few years with installed capacity surpassing 300GW and electricity demand reaching 1,100 billion units. Indias current per capita power consumption is over 1,000kWh (kilowatt hour) per capita per annum and aspires to reach 2,000kWh per capita per annum by 2024. With current power-generation capacity of around 11,000MW, Adani Power is already the largest private power producer in India. We have always ensured fast-paced execution of projects and implemented the best available technologies and practices that can serve as benchmarks for the power industry.The company has already got relief from Appellate Tribunal for Electricity, which held in its judgment that changes in Indonesian regulations affecting discounted coal prices under contract is a force majeure event under the PPAs (power-purchase agreements) and asked the central regulator to grant appropriate relief. The matter has been sub judice from last four years and therefore, though coal price is falling, the company has been under severe financial stress due to delay in grant of appropriate relief. Despite a long legal battle, we are honouring our commitments to supply power. Similarly, grant of relief is also pending for the tariff of power supply from Kawai (Rajasthan) and Tiroda (Maharashtra) power plants.Are you looking for further expansions or acquisitions in the power sector?Yes, we are looking to continue our expansion and I expect some of it will be inorganic. The Indian power sector is witnessing consolidation among the private sector developers. We are looking at all opportunities, brownfield and greenfield projects. A lot of the power projects up for acquisition come with multiple challenges such as transmission evacuation, rail connectivity, no PPA, no domestic coal supply and many more.How have things changed in the power sector under the new leadership at the centre?The proof of success lies in metrics and I think the numbers speak for themselves. I have already spoken about how solar power has been catalysed by the policy initiatives taken by the government. Average solar tariffs are now at Rs4 per unit and this is a tremendous achievement by any yardstick or measure and the long-term cascading benefits of this in helping industries, getting power to rural areas as well as galvanizing the solar value chain in India will be significant.From providing a lifeline to the ailing state-owned power distribution utilities (discoms) in the form of UDAY (Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana) scheme, introducing amendments in the National Tariff Policy, ramping up the countrys traditionally neglected transmission network and boosting domestic coal supply, many initiatives have been introduced by the centre to facilitate sustainable growth in the power sector.In our view, the centre has set the reform process in motion, which has already made a difference, but the full impact will be felt only in the long run.For the groups most successful business, ports, has there been any change in strategy for attaining your previously articulated goal of reaching 200 mtpa by 2020? Also, you have built a huge network of ports across the country, making acquisitions in the east and south. What is the overall strategy?With a strategy to serve large Indian hinterland, APSEZ (Adani Ports and SEZ Ltd) has developed and operates 10 ports/terminals across the coastline of India. All our ports and terminals are strategically located, making a string of ports or the Adani Sagar Mala. This network of multi-cargo ports enables us to cater to major consumption and resource-rich regions of India. The addition of the Kattupalli port (in Tamil Nadu) earlier this year to augment our flanking strategy along with its sister Ennore port in Chennai has been yet another success with volumes at the Kattupalli port already doubling since we have taken over operations. Kattupalli has a tremendous location and we plan to convert it to a multi-cargo port to further capitalize on this advantage. In Kerala, our plan to build out the Vizhinjam transhipment port at the southern-most tip of India is on track and this will be yet another strategic port that will draw traffic from the worlds busiest shipping routes as well as allow our own countrys traffic to be transhipped within our country.In FY16, we handled a cargo volume of 151 MMT and we are expecting 10-15% cargo growth in FY17. While we are seeing growth in cargo handling at our existing ports, we are also expanding our presence across the Indian coastline. Given the growth rates, we have seen in the ports sector and the progress made over the last few years we will reach our target of 200 mtpa well before 2020, most likely well before the end of 2018.We are also targeting to provide value-added services to our customers in form of integrated logistics solutions, which is going to enhance growth prospects of our ports. Having presence across the coastline of India is going to be a key factor in this initiative. Our logistics business has seen record growth over the past three years and is well set to capitalize on the logistics boom as we expand our network of warehouses, ICDs and transportation capabilities. Ultimately, as part of our strategy, we want to be a one-stop shop for many of our major customers.Currently, we are focusing on timely completion of our LNG and LPG terminals at Mundra and Dhamra, coastal shipping, container trans-shipment and improvement in operational efficiency by leveraging technology. We are confident that all these initiatives together will help us in reaching our goal. Mundra is today the largest commercial port of the country, handling over 110 mtpa. How do you continue to keep this momentum going given some stiff competition given by government-controlled major ports especially Kandla Port, your closest competitor in terms of traffic and commercial cargo volumes handled?Mundra is our flagship port and a true success story, which has given new goals to the port sector in India. We are expanding capacity at Mundra port and container terminal 4 would be operational soon.Mundra enjoys superior operational efficiencies owing to its investment in evolving commodity-specific infrastructure such as fully mechanized coal import terminal, fertilizer cargo complex and mechanized steel yard, among others. These facilities ensure best service levels at Mundra port. These coupled with our long-term relationships with stakeholders such as shipping lines and key customers are key factors in maintaining long-term competitiveness in the region and the country. More than 65% of our cargo being handled under long-term service contracts with various customers across various cargo types. These advantages continue to help Mundra port grow, which registered a 12% y-o-y growth in 2016-17.In fact, spurt in cargo handling at Tuna Tekra is one of the significant reasons behind the recent cargo growth visible at Kandla port. (Tuna Tekra is a terminal operated by APSEZ and falls under the purview of Kandla Port Trust.)The upcoming LNG and LPG terminals at Mundra port are going to further strengthen the niche position of the port in the market. Having SEZ, DTA and FTWZ create right ecosystem for the port to offer a long-term advantage to our customers. Furthermore, we continue to focus on efficiency improvement through several operational and technological initiatives to increase value-edge. As highlighted, our integrated logistics service offering is going to add further value to our customers, enhancing their convenience and ease of handling logistics through Mundra port and our other ports in India.How do you see your acquisitions in ports? How do you see them fit in your overall growth plans?Our strategy remains on track as we have built out a network of 10 ports all the way from Mundra (in Gujarat) in the west to Dhamra (in Odisha) in the east. The acquisition of the Dhamra port in 2013 has been a huge success from the operational and strategic perspective and we turned around the performance in the very first year. Given the focus on coastal shipping, we should see a further step change in the performance of Dhamra. The port has increased significantly from handling around 10 mtpa cargo to a port targeting to handle around 21 mtpa cargo in 2016-17. It is being envisioned to replicate success of Mundra port for the east coast. We plan to undertake major capacity enhancements at Dhamra port, taking its current capacity from 20 mtpa to 100 mtpa in future.You have also ventured into defence, where you have floated a separate entity. What is happening there?We are in various discussions to enable the Make in India programme, but its too early for me to make any comment.Some time ago, Adani Group got the environmental nod for setting up a shipbuilding yard in Kutch. Can you elaborate on your plans and also if you plan to build ships for the defence sector.Its too early to elaborate on any of these plans. However, there is no plan for us to build ships for the defence sector.What about your plans to enter the financial services sector? There were reports of Adani planning to acquire Macquarie NBFC.This has been done in a private domain by the promoters.There has been quite a buzz about Adani being a debt-heavy company. What is your take on this? As you are aware, infra is a capital-intensive business. At group level, our long-term debt: Ebitda is at a comfortable level of 3.25:1. The corresponding value of net fixed asset is Rs125,000 crore. Overall, for infra business, we are robustly placed.The social sector is being given more focus in the past couple of years with new CSR guidelines in place. What areas is Adani focusing on? The areas that the Adani Foundation focuses on are education, community health, sustainable livelihood and rural infrastructure. Adani Foundations education programmes have already touched the lives of over 150,000 young students, the healthcare programmes touches the lives of over 200,000 people every year, the sustainable livelihood programs have made over 35,000 people and their entire families self-reliant and the rural infrastructure programmes have improved the lives of over 500,000 people across 177 villages by helping provide better roads, drinking water and other basic facilities.What about ventures like real estate, promoted by the family?Adani Realty, our youngest venture, is vigorously expanding its offering of high-quality residential, commercial, affordable and township projects in Mumbai, Gurgaon and Ahmedabad. Our execution is always on track with improving focus on satisfying customer needs and trust. Shantigram is probably one of Indias finest mixed-use townships already. Despite the temporary downturn in the realty sector, you will hear more about Adani Realty and its ambitious growth plans ahead.How do you see the overall Indian economy for industries today under the government at the centre? A lot has been written about your proximity to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. How do you view this?Ultimately, we should let the metrics speak for themselves. India continues to remain the bright spot in the otherwise slowing global economy. It has been and will also be in 2016-17 the fastest-growing major economy, growing at 7.5% as against a global economy that is projected to grow at 3.5%. Today, there is increasing recognition that a large part of the growth is a result of the policies that the government has moved to quickly introduce reforms after coming to power. FDI (foreign direct investment) is a sign of global confidence and FDI over the past 24 months in India has grown 46% and stands at $62 billion, which is an all-time record. In my opinion, we are just getting started and the actual benefits will be realized by the industries over the next decade.The next generation of Adani Group seems to be gearing up for the future. Your elder son Karan Adani was earlier this year appointed as new CEO of APSEZ. How do you see him taking bigger responsibilities?Karan has now been involved in the ports business for over seven years now and I am proud of the way he has developed himself with the strategic and operational role he has played over the years. He has built a well-rounded leadership team who can capitalize on the opportunities in the sector. I am confident that the next phase of expansion that we will see under his leadership will help APSEZ further strengthen its position as a port and port-led development company.",2016-12-19,0v3GPxrwuJA6gebfOMy7iN,"Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani on the Australian coal mine project, plans for the solar power sector and Adani ports along Indias coastline",02:36,We aspire to be world leaders with our integrated pit-to-plug strategy: Adani
0.34,"Mumbai/Ahmedabad: Ruias promoted Essar Oil on Saturday sealed a deal with Russias Rosneft, United Capital Partners and Trafigura Group Pte. to sell 98% in its most priced asset, the 20 million tonnes per annum Vadinar refinery and Vadinar Port in Gujarat. 
				   
				An all-cash deal, the transaction includes Rs.72,800 crore ($10.9 billion) for Essar Oils refining and retail assets, and Rs.13,300 crore ($2 billion) for Vadinar port and related infrastructure. According to one of the sources directly involved in the deal, the total equity value of the deal stands at about $6.4 billion and $6.6 billion as debt approximately.The deal was signed at the Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) summit in Goa in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The funds realised through the deal will be used to settle Essar Group debt, said Prashant Ruia, director, Essar Group at the press meet held in Goa. The Group has a debt of about Rs.80,000 crore that it accumulated in a bid to expand operations and buy steel and oil assets overseas. We will be utilising significant portion of this for debt reduction, Ruia told reporters in Goa. The deal had been in the works since July 2015. Rosneft is worlds largest publicly listed company and will take 49% stake in Essar Oil. Netherlands-based Trafigura Group Pte., one of the worlds biggest commodity trading companies, and United Capital Partners (UCP), a Russian investment fund, will together hold the rest 49% between them. In July, Mint reported that Essar Oil is in talks with oil trading companies including Trafigura Group to sell stake in the company. Investing in EOL, which operates one of the worlds most complex refineries and runs Indias largest private sector retail network, gives the new stakeholders a strong foothold in the Indian market that will witness robust demand growth for petroleum products in the long term. The growth for refined petroleum products in the Indian market for the next five years is expected to be in the 5%-7% range, Essar Oil said in a statement. Vadinar Refinery is Indias second largest refinery contributing 9% of Indias refining output. Essar Oil also operates a pan-India network of 2,700 retail outlets.The closing of the transaction is conditional upon receiving requisite regulatory approvals and other customary conditions. The parties expect to obtain the relevant approvals before the end of the first quarter of 2017, Essar Oil said in a press statement. India allows 100% foreign direct investment in the oil and gas sector. Once the Rosneft deal is officially closed, Essar Oils refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat is likely to begin receiving crude oil from Rosneft. Last July, Essar Oil signed an agreement with Rosneft for supply of 10 million tonnes of crude per annum to the Vadinar refinery in Gujarat for 10 years.This August, Essar Oil had said that it will invest an additional Rs.1,200 crore over the next two-to-three years to upgrade its Vadinar refinery in Gujarat to boost refinery margins by $1.5 per barrel. The company, had also said that it is weighing the option of reviving its petrochemical complex project with an investment of around $1-1.5 billion.The company has already earmarked and acquired land, around 5km away from the refinery, to develop a petrochemical complex that would produce gasoline, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and propylene among other products.Essar Oil which runs a network of 2,700 operating retail outlets, has 2,850 additional outlets in various stages of implementation. Essar Oil has a target of reaching 4,300 operational outlets by the end of FY 2016-17. The total capital investment in these outlets would be about Rs.2,100 crore, which will be mostly infused by franchisees.Arpwood Capital acted as sole advisors to Essar on the transaction.India, consuming 4.3 million barrels per day, is experiencing fastest growing oil consumption in the World right now. Ownership of refinery and access to retail network in India would be an excellent hedge against fluctuating oil prices,said Debasish Mishra, partner at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India Pvt. Ltd.

0.24,"GAIL (India) Ltds share price has gone up 7.3% in the last two trading days.
				   
				On Wednesday, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB)s tariff order increased the companys KG basin pipeline tariff to Rs.45.3 per million British thermal units (mBtu) from a provisional tariff of Rs.5.6 per mBtu. That led to the spike.As Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd pointed out in a note to clients that even though the KG network is one of GAILs smaller networks and accounts for less than 5% volume, this large hike can raise GAILs FY17 earnings by more than 3%.Importantly, investor confidence would increase, that forthcoming tariff orders will also lead to tariff hikes (though not such steep ones), adds the Nomura report. Considering that the pipeline networks useful life (25 years) is ending on 11 February 2017, earlier period adjustments would be taken into account, leading to a sharp tariff hike for the KG network.Despite the recent increase, the GAIL stock is still 6.4% lower so far this fiscal. However, from its yearly low in August, the share price has appreciated by one-third. The renegotiation of Qatars RasGas LNG contract is a key reason for the optimism. Input costs of GAILs petrochemicals business are expected to reduce as LNG prices have been renegotiated at a lower price.As Antique Stock Broking Ltd pointed out, the stabilization of the expanded petrochemicals capacity in the first half of 2016 would lead to higher utilization, which would ensure lower fixed unit operating cost and a higher revenue over FY17-18 for the business. Nevertheless, the sharp decline in petrochemical prices and slow pace of production ramp-up are metrics investors should watch out for. For the nine months to December, the petrochemicals business has posted earnings before tax and interest loss of about Rs.700 crore. Weak realizations and higher input costs are some factors to blame.We have marginally revised up our Ebitda estimates in FY16/FY17 by ~5% building in a) better petrochemicals Ebitda on account of volume ramp-up/ cheaper spot prices b) a pick-up in gas trading segment due to increase in spot volume, said Ambit Capital Pvt. Ltd in its last quarter results review.

0.37,"Saudi Arabia will soon choose a site for its first nuclear power plant as the worlds biggest crude exporter seeks to diversify its sources of energy.
				   
				We will be selecting sites very soon that we will reserve for our first nuclear energy power plant, Khalid Al-Falih, the countrys energy minister, said Wednesday at the Oil and Money conference in London. We hope within the next 12 months that we will be announcing concrete plans. The government wants to make sure all regulatory steps are taken beforehand, he said. Wind and solar power will also play a very significant part of Saudi Arabias energy mix, Al-Falih said. Saudi Arabia, which laid out its ambitions for diversifying energy supplies in 2012, is trying to reduce the economys dependence on hydrocarbons as low oil prices strain the budget. The country raised $17.5 billion this week in the biggest bond sale from an emerging-market nation as it seeks to bridge a deficit that widened last year to about 15 percent of gross domestic product.UAE ReactorsThe kingdom has a target of generating 6 to 7 gigawatts of electricity from nuclear power by 2032, rising to 17 gigawatts by 2040, Maher al-Odan, an adviser to the government on renewables planning, said in April of last year. Abu Dhabi in the neighboring United Arab Emirates is building the Gulf Arab regions first nuclear power plant. The reactor, one of four that the emirate is planning, is scheduled for completion in 2017. Emirates Nuclear Energy Corp. and Korea Electric Power Corp. signed a joint-venture agreement on Thursday for a long-term partnership in the U.A.E.s nuclear program, ENEC said in an e-mailed statement. Korea Electric is taking an 18 percent stake in a venture representing the commercial interests of the U.A.E.s Barakah nuclear-plant project, with ENEC holding the rest, according to the statement. Construction of the U.A.E.s four reactors is more than 71 percent complete, and all the plants are to be finished in 2020, ENEC said. The U.A.E., like Saudi Arabia, a fellow member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, is trying to reduce its reliance on oil exports.

				But so far in fiscal year 2017, there has been some optimism on oil and thats good news for Indian state-run oil producing companiesOil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL), profits of which are highly leveraged to crude oil prices. Since 1 April, the Brent crude price has increased as much as 27% to $49.69 per barrel on Wednesday. Outages in several key producing countries such as Canada and Nigeria are responsible for the recent spike in prices.While the recent strength in prices augurs well, its not as if the outlook over a medium-term perspective has turned particularly bright. We do expect some improvement in global supply-demand balance for crude oil over the next two years, said a report from Kotak Institutional Equities Research on Tuesday. They forecast global crude oil price at $50 a barrel for FY2017 and $55 a barrel for FY2018, according to the report.For now, lower crude oil prices have meant disappointing net price realizations for the quarter gone by. ONGC and OILs net realizations came in at $34.88 a barrel and $32.62 a barrel, respectively. Further, the production performance wasnt impressive either. ONGCs crude oil production fell 2% year-on-year while its gas production declined at a faster pace of 10%. Sure, OILs gas production increased 8% year-on-year but it has declined 7.5% compared with the December quarter.

0.96,"Bengaluru: Titan Co Ltd, a Tata group firm that makes watches and jewellery, reported a 23.51% year-on-year increase in net profit to Rs180.76 crore in the September quarter as it benefited from cost cuts, improved margins and festive season sales.
				   
				Titans revenue fell marginally by 0.1% to Rs2,659.83 crore during the period.In April, Titan announced a voluntary retirement scheme for employees who had either finished 10 years of service or were above 40 years of age in a bid to improve productivity and cut costs. The move appears to have paid off in terms of profit growth.Gross margins were very good during the quarter. We are at 42% studded ratio and that added to the margin substantially. Another fact is also that in plain gold jewellery our margins were significantly higher thanks to the higher gold prices, senior executives at Titan including CEO (jewellery) C.K. Venkataraman, told analysts in a conference call on Friday.Still, both net profit and sales missed Street expectations of Rs192.20 crore and Rs 3,040.20 crore, respectively, based on a survey of analysts by Bloomberg.Net sales at its jewellery and eye-wear segments, and other businesses, including precision engineering and accessories, grew while revenue from watches declined from year-ago period.This was an extremely good quarter for the company,  with respect to profit. All businesses of the firm recorded profits in the quarter. The jewellery business had an extremely good studded jewellery activation and the watches business launched its second smart watch, JUXT Pro, Bhaskar Bhat, managing director of Titan, said in a BSE filing on Friday.In a BSE filing in early October, Titan had warned that studded jewellery sales had surpassed its expectations in the September quarter but volatile gold prices and low consumer confidence had dented sales of gold jewellery.That, perhaps, explains why revenue from the companys jewellery segment, run under the Tanishq brand, grew just 0.24% year-on-year in the quarter to Rs1,987.51 crore.Revenue from this segment typically accounts for a major chunk of overall sales.For the Dussehra to Diwali festive period, Tanishq registered a growth of 39% over last year, Bhat said in the filing.On Friday, Titans shares ended at Rs368.50 on the BSE, down 2.16% from the previous close while Indias benchmark Sensex Index fell 0.57% to close at 27274.15 points.",2016-11-04,2cANNdBicJMP0Nx2QCbX1H,"Titans second-quarter revenue, however, fell marginally by 0.1% to Rs2,659.83 crore ",15:44,"Titan Q2 profit rises 23.5% on improved margins, cost-cutting measures "
0.43,"New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modis drive to give liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) connections to the poor without upfront charges is gaining the scale of a flagship entitlement scheme akin to the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGA) piloted by the previous Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government.
				   
				The Ujjwala scheme of distributing clean cooking fuel to women in poor households launched in May by Modi is set to cross 1 crore connections this week, with states in the east, north-east and hilly regions being the biggest beneficiaries, a person involved in implementing the scheme said on condition of anonymity.Poll-bound Uttar Pradesh is the largest beneficiary state with 34 lakh poor women getting the connection, followed by states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Odisha.Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Jharkhand and the north-eastern states too have got priority status under the scheme with no cap on the number of connections to be issued. Members of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and minorities are the major beneficiaries of the scheme.Interestingly, while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had performed well in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar, the party wants to consolidate its position in states like Odisha and make further inroads into the north-east which together comprise 25 Lok Sabha seats. The BJP is in power in Assam. It also partners government in Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh. Similarly, West Bengal and Odisha remain crucial for the BJP because the two states together control 63 Lok Sabha seats.Jammu & Kashmir is also a priority area for the BJP where it had won seats in Jammu and Ladakh regions, while the party continued its dismal performance in the Kashmir valley where it drew a blank. The performance was repeated in December 2014 when BJP won seats in Jammu but didnt open an account in the Valley.The steps taken by the NDA is also crucial because the BJP leadership hopes to play a decisive role in the assembly elections in states like Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarkhand, Uttar Pradesh and north-eastern states in the next two years.States are given priority status if LPG use is less than the national average of 61% of households. Geographically and economically-challenged states received priority as LPG access has been less in those regions.Our target for the current financial year is 1.5 crore connections. We have already cleared applications more than that and are working towards releasing all of that shortly. In a day or two, we will cross the one crore mark, explained the person quoted above.To make sure that all the households that are given connections get easy refills, oil companies Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd are adding the number of distributors.This year, the companies added 300 distributorships and more than 1,600 applications are being processed. Companies have also identified 400 locations for new distributors in Uttar Pradesh.The drive to promote LPG as a clean cooking fuel is altering the countrys energy mix resulting in higher import of LPG and sufficient kerosene for industrial purposes as well as for exports. The drive is also part of a strategy to veer the country towards a gas-based economy in light of the climate change action plan.

In an email response, Olympus Capital declined to comment. Mails sent to Anand Prakash, managing director of ACP, went unanswered.Suzlon, in January 2016, won 210 MW of solar projects in Telangana through a competitive bidding process. These include one project of 100 MW, one of 50 MW and four projects of 15 MW each.The company has in the recent past sold minority stakes in these assets. In October, Canadian Solar Inc. acquired 49% stakes in two Suzlon projects in Telangana. Also in October, Suzlon sold another 49% stake in a 50 MW project to Ostro Energy Pvt. Ltd.ACP is a joint initiative of the Asian Development Bank, Japanese financial services group ORIX Corp. and Dutch asset management firm Robeco Group N.V. to make private equity investments in the clean energy, resource efficiency and environmental sectors in Asia.Hong Kong-based ACP has so far made two investments, of which one is in Indian cold chain logistics firm ColdEX. In February 2016, ColdEX Logistics Pvt. Ltd, which runs a fleet of 850 refrigerated trucks known as reefers, agreed to sell a stake in itself to ACP. The fund also acquired the stake of ColdExs existing private equity investor India Equity Partners, which had invested in the company in 2010.Olympus Capital, founded in 1997, has invested more than $2 billion of equity capital in over 50 portfolio companies throughout Asia, including China, India, Japan, South Korea and South-East Asia, according to the funds website.In India, Olympus has invested in companies such as Aster DM Healthcare, Quatrro Global Services and Vishwa Infrastructure and Services.Indias renewable energy sector has seen several private equity and infrastructure-focused funds invest in the platform strategy. In September, Mint reported that asset management firm IDFC Alternatives Ltd will float a platform to hold its renewable energy assets. The company was targeting acquisitions of 250 MW of operating wind, solar and small hydro capacity by the end of 2016 and upwards of 600 MW over the next 18 months.In October, IDFC Alternatives announced that it is acquiring 24 MW of wind power assets from Jindal Steel & Power Ltd.

				In what now appears to be a remarkably prescient remark, the magazine said, That the revered Mr (Ratan) Tata still chairs the Trusts that bear his name may make it trickier for Mr (Cyrus) Mistry to be his own man.Was Mistrys performance so bad that he had to be removed? The Street seems to think otherwise.One obvious yardstick is the market capitalization of the group. On 1 January 2013, soon after Mistry took charge, the market capitalization of listed companies of the Tata group was Rs4.97 trillion. On Monday, when the decision was announced, the market capitalization stood at Rs8.71 trilliona massive 75% higher in less than four years.The Tata groups increase in market capitalization beats benchmarks such as the Nifty, which has risen 47% and big groups such as Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) with a market capitalization growth of 27% in the same period. Of course, one cannot ignore the market cap of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), one of the groups premium firms that spews  cash, alone is higher than that of RIL. And it does paper over the fact that many of the group companies are not doing so well. But, on key return ratios such as return on equity, the groups leading firms are on par with peers. As far as revenue goes, compounded revenue growth between FY13 and FY16 of TCS, Tata Motors Ltd (led by Jaguar Land Rover Plc) and even Indian Hotels Corp. Ltd have outperformed their peers.ALSO READ | Cyrus Mistry removed as Tata Sons chairman, Ratan Tata returnsYes, there were some bad eggs in the basket. For instance, Tata Steel Ltds acquisition of European steel giant Corus was sinking under its own weight. But its performance has perhaps more to do with the severe cyclical downturn in commodities, with global players bleeding and shutting down plants.Tata Docomo likewise was caught in a long-drawn and bitter legal tussle, the genesis of which predated Mistrys taking charge.If anything, media reports suggest Mistry was trying to put the vast and diversified conglomerate in order. He put Coruss steel assets in the UK on the block and took firm steps to sell off assets of the non-performing businesses of Indian Hotels and Tata Chemicals. There were also reports that he was telling managers to pull up their socks. At the Tata Motors annual general meeting on 9 August, Mistry was reported to have said, I think the journey is going to be long and not for the faint-hearted.ALSO READ | Uneasy lies the Tata crownIn any case, analysts and industry experts say that four years is too short a time period to judge Mistrys performance by or even compare it with that of Ratan Tata, who was at the helm unfettered for three decades. It may also be a trifle unfair to hold Mistry responsible as chairman for the weak performance of some of the companies in his group, considering that he inherited massive problems.Clearly, Mistry was attempting to change the course of the ship, with a sharper focus on shareholder value. Unfortunately, he was not very communicative about his plans.What impact will the announcement have on Tata group shares? It is now up to the board to take immediate steps to restore investor confidence. Unless the uncertainty is resolved soon, Tata group shares may pay a price for the abrupt and opaque decision to replace Mistry and the failure to communicate to investors that the board had cogent reasons for doing so.",2016-10-25,408Zf7yPvqLWnOmSQTyfDL,"Tata group shares may pay a price for abrupt, opaque decision to replace Cyrus Mistry with Ratan Tata as interim chairman",07:33,The elephant unseats Cyrus Mistry

In September, however, the deal was scrapped owing to SunEdisons financial problems. Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners is the majority owner in Continuum Wind, a Singapore-based, India-focused firm, in which it invested $212 million in 2012. Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners manages $4 billion globally.Continuum was set up in 2009 by Arvind Bansal and Vikash Saraf. Moelis and Partners Group declined to comment. Emails sent on Tuesday to Brookfield and Morgan Stanley did not elicit any response.Continuums asset sale talks with Brookfield come against the backdrop of a strong consolidation drive in Indias renewable energy industry.In June, Tata Power Co. Ltd acquired around 1.1 gigawatts of solar and wind power assets from Welspun Enterprise Ltd at an enterprise value of $1.4 billion.In September, Hyderabad-based renewable company Greenko Energy Holdings, acquired SunEdison Inc.s Indian solar asset portfolio for around $392 million.

Finance costs in the quarter rose 22.8% to Rs1,351.06 crore.The company said that its deliveries in the September quarter stood at 5.65 million tonnes.Tata Steel has been grappling with rising shipments from China, where an economic slowdown has depressed demand and put steel prices under pressure.Over the past year, Tata Steel has cut jobs and shuttered some of its plants in Europe, blaming cheap Chinese imports, a strong pound and high costs for its decision.Tata Sons Ltds ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry had played a key role in discussions about merging Tata Steels European operations with those of Thyssenkrupp AG. Tata Steel said it is still involved in discussions with the German company for a potential joint venture and that the process of selling Tata Steel UKs speciality steels business and its Hartlepool pipe mills are ongoing.Tata Steel UK is deeply engaged with all relevant stakeholders in the UK including the unions, the pension trustees and the pension regulators to find a structural solution and a way forward with regards to the affordability of the legacy pension scheme liabilities. Discussions are currently ongoing, the company said in a statement.Strong monsoons affected steel demand across the country while the increase in domestic capacity added to the competitive pressure... There was a sharp drop in realizations which coupled with the ramp-up costs at the Kalinganagar plant kept margins under pressure. While realizations have since improved, rising coal prices will affect margins in the short run and will necessitate increase in steel realizations going forward, said T.V. Narendran, managing director of Tata Steel India and South-East Asia.In March, Tata Steel decided to put its entire UK business on the block in the face of a slump in steel demand and prices, but the plan hit a roadblock due to uncertainty stemming from Britains decision to exit the European Union.The group eventually halted the sale process in July in favour of discussions for a joint venture with strategic players in the steel industry, including Thyssenkrupp.As of 30 September, Tata Steels net debt stood at Rs75,563 crore.Overall numbers were below expectations.

				Australia, Qatar and Iran could all act as potential suppliers of long-term LNG contracts, power minister Piyush Goyal said in Sydney on Thursday. The global search for LNG comes as Indias gas-fired plants, which can generate nearly 25 gigawatts of power, run at less than a quarter of their capacity because of a shortage of the fuel at affordable prices.I think gas needs to be between $5 and $5.50 landed at my power plant. That is what Im looking for in the medium- to long-term, Goyal said in an interview. Otherwise I wont be able to start those gas plants.NTPC Ltd., Indias biggest power producer, is said to be seeking to terminate a long-term supply contract for LNG because the fuel is too expensive to be used in power generation. That highlights the countrys difficulty in switching from coal to natural gas for power generation, undermining Prime Minister Narendra Modis efforts to cut carbon emissions and promote clean energy.As of now I dont have any credible offer on the table but Im fairly confident from talking to people across the world that if not Australia, maybe Qatar will give it to me, or Iran might be able to get me something, Goyal said. Ill go to Europe next week to discuss the same thing.

				The Singapore complex gross refining margin (GRM), a measure of the difference between the per-barrel price of crude and the value of products distilled from it, dropped to $5 a barrel in the June quarter, compared with $7.7 a barrel in the March quarter. Still, the reported GRMs of Indian refining firms on a sequential basis fared better. However, these GRMs got a boost on account of inventory gains, thanks to the rising oil price trend over the quarter.Adjusted for refining inventory gains, the GRMs of oil marketing companies (OMCs) were in the range of $4-5 a barrel, according to Spark Capital Advisors (India) Pvt. Ltd. OMCs include Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC). OMCs results beat Street expectations. IOCs operating profit increased by one-third, compared with last years June quarter. HPCLs operating profit rose 17% year-on-year, while BPCLs operating profit increased at a much slower pace of 3%.GRM is a measure of profitability.Reliance Industries Ltds (RIL) reported premium of $6.5 per barrel over Singapore GRM was the highest in the past eight years, according to the firm, and exceeded Street estimates by a good margin. Most analysts expected RILs GRM to be $9.5-10 per barrel. But RILs GRM came in at $11.5 per barrel. The management indicated $2 per barrel can be attributed to gains from inventory, hedging and risk management. RILs stand-alone revenue fell 19%, reflecting the decline in the broader crude oil prices, while net profit rose about 19%. That was because of a 628 basis points jump in operating profit margin, a 3% decline in depreciation cost and an 18.5% rise in other income. A basis point is 0.01%.Meanwhile, oil producers have had it tough what with oil prices languishing. As expected, net price realization of Oil and Natural Gas Corp.

-0.55,"Singapore: This weeks putsch at Tata Sons has already served one useful purpose. While its been clear for a while that something wasnt quite right at the $100 billion Indian empire, the chairmans surprise ouster has made it possible to start asking questions about strategy (or lack of it) at a conglomerate that traces its roots to the American civil war.
				   
				Did the newly dumped Cyrus Mistry fail to plant enough saplings of growth? Or did Ratan Tata, who gave Mistry the job only to take it back four years later, not want to face reality? Are some of the businesses he acquired now covered in weeds, compelling Mistry to trim the outgrowth of debt?The answers will be important for investors in the groups publicly traded units, who, at present, have no idea how the coup at the holding company will affect them.Letting Tata vs. Mistry play out in public is a delicious idea. With the Economic Times leaking the contents of an unhappy email purportedly written by Mistry to the Tata Sons board and owners, and at least one of those shareholders giving a TV interview on what they disliked about the Mistry regime, the slugfest has begun. Its time to pour a cup of (Tata-owned) Tetley tea, and settle down.Also Read: Tata Sons dividend payout steady for last decadeV.R. Mehta, a trustee at one of the philanthropic organizations that collectively own roughly two-thirds of Tata Sons, is right to argue that under Mistry, the dividends from group companies have become increasingly reliant on just two businesses  Jaguar Land Rover, one of Ratan Tatas most audacious acquisitions, and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., the software export unit.But to what extent is Mistry responsible? In the letter attributed to him by the Economic Times, the ousted chairman claimed that it was Ratan Tatas 2009 decision to buy a property in suburban Mumbai  in disuse since a 1993 bomb attack  that led to Indian Hotels Co.s entire net worth getting wiped out. The companys last big profit, of $115 million, was in 2008.Then again, a year after Ratan Tata bought Corus Group Plc in 2006, Tata Steel went on to earn an annual profit of almost $3 billion. A China-led global steel glut has turned that profit into a loss of $1 billion over the past four quarters, with Mistry warning in his letter of a potential $10 billion impairment of European steel assets.Tata Steels loss in past 4 quartersMistry cant shift all the blame to his predecessor. While Ratan Tatas non-JLR car investments have mostly flopped, Mistrys problem was not having enough big ideas of his own. He may not have been the one to sink the wireless telecom unit, but he did precious little to revive it. He could also have handled the ugly spat with NTT Docomo Inc., the partner in that business, a lot better.Also Read: Ratan Tata seeks to rally group firms after Cyrus Mistry ousterThe Tata Group has survived two world wars, nationalization of its prized airline by a socialist-minded government and other tribulations. But the damage to the groups reputation for fair dealing is probably Mistrys biggest failing as chairman.That failure has consequences. In Singapore, bond investors are scratching their heads over a dollar-denominated perpetual bond issue by Tata International Ltd. The debt of this thinly capitalized company will derive its value from implicit support by the Tata group. A few years ago, it would have been preposterous to suggest that the Tatas would stake their reputation to save $1.17 billion  the amount the group is seeking to avoid paying in the Docomo dispute. Its worrisome if investors are no longer sure whether the group will even back a $150 million to $200 million bond issue. A no-holds-barred airing of differences between Mistry and Ratan Tata may help reestablish just what it is that shareholders of Tata Sons want their group to stand for. That will be the cherry on the cake from this entertaining spectacle  to be washed down with that Tetley tea, of course.

0.66,"New Delhi: The fine print of Union budget 2017-18 has served incentives for the energy sector such as lowering the tax burden on carbon trading gains and making it more attractive for foreign oil firms to store crude oil in Indias strategic reserves. 
				   
				The incentives seek to support energy security and climate change goals of the country after having decisively departed from petroleum subsidies.Union finance minister Arun Jaitley has proposed to cut the tax on gains from carbon trading to 10% from 30% in a move expected to make investments into energy efficiency and clean energy more rewarding. The minister also extended the income tax exemption to foreign companies storing crude oil in Indias strategic reserves to any gains from sale of such oil even after expiry of the companys contract with the Indian government. At the moment, this benefit is limited only during the contract period.The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) set up under the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) allows investors in emission-reducing projects to generate tradable credits corresponding to the volume of emission reduction achieved. These credits can be sold to industrialized countries. So far, the income tax department has been treating the income on transfer of carbon credits as business income, subject to a 30% tax. Jaitley has proposed that it shall be a concessional 10% and applicable surcharge and cess. This amendment will take effect from the 2017-18 financial year.The move to incentivize clean energy projects comes parallelly with gradual increase in taxes on petroleum products and the cess on coal, making India one of the leaders in climate change action. Since June 2014, when international oil prices started declining, India has increased excise duty on branded petrol from Rs15.5 a litre to Rs22.7 a litre as of December 2016 and on branded diesel from Rs5.8 a litre to Rs19.7 a litre, pointed out the Economic Survey 2016-17.In contrast, the governments of most advanced countries have simply passed on the benefits to consumers, setting back the cause of curbing climate change. As a result, India now outperforms all the countries except those in Europe in terms of tax on petroleum and diesel, the survey pointed out.Ashish Khanna, chief executive officer of Tata Power Solar Systems Ltd, said the budget demonstrated the governments commitment to being a front runner in renewable sources of energy.In line with the governments stated objective of phasing out corporate tax exemptions in order to be able to moderate the corporate tax rate from 30% to 25%, Jaitley did not extend the income tax incentive for power projects under section 80 IA after it expires on 31 March 2017.

0.24,"Public sector enterprises are not known to be investor-savvy. In the last three years, the S&P BSE PSU index, which tracks shares of public sector units (PSUs), gained 18.6%, half of what the benchmark Sensex delivered (38.9%). But one business bucking this trend is the power sector.
				   
				Shares of notable central PSUsPower Grid Corp. of India Ltd, NTPC Ltd, Neyveli Lignite Corp. Ltd, SJVN Ltd and NHPC Ltddelivered double digit returns in the last three years, whereas shareholders of private sector firms Tata Power Co. Ltd and Adani Power Ltd have lost out. The divergence can be partly explained by the return on equity (RoE). The higher the ratio, the better it is for investors. The average RoE of the five PSUs stood at 11% in the past fiscal. A similar calculation of nine private sector firms stood at 4%, data from Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd show.While returns of PSUs have been consistent, private firms returns have been volatile. Three of the five PSUs generated double-digit RoEs in each of the last five years, a feat matched by none of the private firms, except JSW Energy Ltd which delivered double-digit returns in four of the last five years.The reasons are not hard to find. PSU utilities work mostly on the cost-plus modelinvestments, assets are assured of minimum returns. Private firms, on the other hand, took excessive risks, running into business and regulatory hurdles. But this scenario will change. Private firms are seeking better tariffs for underperforming plants and are trying to improve asset utilization. Also, a slowdown in hydro capacity additions and delays in execution means ROEs at SJVN and NHPC can soften or suffer for some time. Within the PSU lot, the underperformance of SJVN, and NHPC to some extent, may be offset by Power Grid and NTPC. Religare Capital Markets Ltd expects Power Grids RoE to improve by about 100 basis points on high capex and capitalization schedule. Similarly, the upcoming capacities are expected to push up NTPCs returns from next year.

0.68,"New Delhi: Finance minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday announced plans to create a state-run behemoth by merging various public sector firms in the oil and gas sector.
				   
				We propose to create an integrated public sector oil major which will be able to match the performance of international and domestic private sector oil and gas companies, said Jaitley in his budget speech.International firms such as ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell plc and BP Plc have integrated operations across upstream exploration, refining and fuel retail.The Indian governments move comes in the backdrop of concerns articulated over rising oil prices presenting a challenge to the countrys growth. The price of crude oil in the Indian energy basket has increased from $39.9 in April 2016 to $52.7 in December 2016.The Indian energy basket represents the average of Oman, Dubai and Brent crude. The price was $54.63 per barrel on Friday.The state-owned firms in the oil and gas sector are; Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC), Oil India Ltd, GAIL (India) Ltd, Indian Oil Corp., Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Numaligarh Refinery Ltd, Chennai Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Engineers India Ltd,  Balmer Lawrie & Co. Ltd, and Biecco Lawrie Co. Ltd.We see opportunities to strengthen our CPSEs (central public sector enterprises) through consolidation, mergers and acquisitions. By these methods, the CPSEs can be integrated across the value chain of an industry. It will give them capacity to bear higher risks, avail economies of scale, take higher investment decisions and create more value for the stakeholders. Possibilities of such restructuring are visible in the oil and gas sector, Jaitley said.The concern over crude oil prices stems from Indias energy import bill of around $150 billion, expected to reach $300 billion by 2030. India imports around 80% of its crude oil and 18% of its natural gas requirements. India imported 202 million tonnes of oil in 2015-16.The state owned firms welcomed the move.Though the finer details are yet to come but the intention appears to form an integrated company on the lines of integrated oil firms such as ExxonMobil, Shell and BP, said Dinesh K. Sarraf, chairman and managing director, ONGC.This also comes at a time of faltering domestic crude oil and gas production and output cuts announced by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec). India is one of the major consumers of Opecs production, with the grouping accounting for 85% and 94% of Indias crude oil and gas imports.Indias energy demand growth is expected to outpace the other BRIC (Brazil, Russia, China, India) countries, according to the latest BP Energy Outlook released last week.The new entity will have economies of scale and Indian industrys negotiating power globally will increase significantly.

0.1,"Seoul: Billionaire Shin Dong-joo has reason to be bitter. In the past couple of years, hes been suspended by his father, fired by his younger brother and indicted on charges of embezzlement by South Korean prosecutors.
				   
				Yet the former No. 2 at Lotte Group says hes confident hell clear his name in court, overthrow his brother as chairman and seize control of a business empire that generates more revenue than Google Inc. or Airbus Group. His plan is to take advantage of the groups complex network of more than 70 cross shareholdings. If he can gain the votes of minority shareholders in one Japanese unit that binds the whole conglomerate together, he says he can effectively control the group.My final target is to take control of Lotte, Shin, 62, said in his office in Seoul in his first interview with foreign media. My brother and the current management destroyed (Lottes) good corporate culture.Shin is attempting to pull off a unique coup in Korean corporate historythe takeover of one of the countrys giant family-run business groups, known as the chaebol. If he succeeds, hell take charge of the nations largest chain of shopping malls, duty-free stores, hotels and amusement parks, one whose overseas assets include Guylian Belgian chocolates and New Yorks Palace Hotel. ALSO READ: Lotte scraps $4.5 billion hotel IPO as probes deepen crisisCoup attemptsIts a big if. His brother Shin Dong-bin, chairman of Lotte Group, outguns him in terms of resources and has already fended off numerous coup attempts. The brothers given names will be used in this article for clarity.No coup has ever succeeded among the chaebol, said Chung Sun-sup, CEO of Chaebul.com, a website that tracks the chaebol. He said Dong-joos best chance would be if his brother was convicted as a result of the investigation this year into corruption at the company. Dong-joo has also been charged but both brothers deny the allegations. Meanwhile, the family feud is hurting Lotte and has added another stain to the embattled reputation of the chaebol groups this year, which have already suffered the bankruptcy of Hanjin Shipping Co., Samsung Electronics Co.s exploding phones and an influence-peddling scandal that cost President Park Geun-hye her job.The battle at Lotte is among the fiercest corporate power struggles in Asia -- rivaling the brawl raging atop Indias Tata Group -- as some of the regions biggest dynasties undergo a once-in-a-generation leadership change.Lotte was founded seven decades ago by Shin Kyuk-ho in Japan, where he had earlier attended Waseda University. He started out selling chewing gum and built a business empire in Japan and Korea. The two brothers grew up together in Japan, with the elder learning to run the Japanese units and the younger taking charge of the Korean part.The trouble began when the ailing patriarch, now 94, fired his eldest son Dong-joo in January 2015 and took away some of his voting rights. Dong-joo says he was removed because the president of Lotte Holdings, Takayuki Tsukuda, falsely told his father that he was responsible for causing losses. Dong-joo said the accusations were part of a plan to wrest control of the company.Fathers forgivenessThe first thing for me to do was to persuade my father about the real situation, Dong-joo said. It took several months to change his mind.He did. In July 2015, the patriarch flew to Tokyo to overturn the dismissal but was thwarted when Dong-bin, Tsukuda and Chief Financial Officer Masamoto Kobayashi refused to meet him, according to a copy of testimony Dong-joo gave to Korean prosecutors earlier this year. The next day, the trio called an emergency board meeting and ousted the groups founder as the head of Lotte Holdings.Lotte Holdings declined to comment on any of the ousted executives allegations and wouldnt make Tsukuda or Kobayashi available for comment.Lotte Group said in a statement to Bloomberg News that Dong-joo was fired because he made unauthorized investments in a software venture that led to about 1 billion yen ($8.7 million) in losses. Lotte Chairman Dong-bin, 61, wasnt available for an interview, the group said.To insist one should be able to reclaim the company just because hes the owners son shows he has an outdated perspective and sees the company as a personal belonging Lotte said. Dong-joo is remorseless and lacks managerial competence, according to the statement.China expansionDong-joo said his brother is the one who is shortsighted. Dong-bin should be blamed for changing Lottes culture to one where managers constantly fear getting fired, he said. He also blamed Dong-bins expansion in China for what he estimated to be 2.4 trillion won ($2.1 billion) in losses for the group.The best players come to China and fight like at the Olympics, Dong-joo said in an interview in the Gran Seoul building, a block away from Lottes headquarters in the South Korean capital. The current management team underestimated the situation. Timeline of events that have roiled Lottes Shin familyLotte couldnt confirm the amount of the China losses. It said that Dong-bin is a proven leader who increased the groups annual sales to about 90 trillion won, from 26 trillion won in 2004, and pushed for the listing of Lotte Shopping Co. to enhance transparency. The chairman has a strategy to enhance group transparency and become a better corporate citizen, it said.As to Dong-joo, his strategy centers around Lotte Holdings Co., the closely held Tokyo-based company that owns about 99% of Hotel Lotte Co., which in turn controls the conglomerates scores of businesses in Korea. He argues that the best way to improve the groups governance issues would be a public share sale of the holding company.Dong-joo commands 33.3% of votes at Lotte Holdings, theoretically giving him a larger say than the 22.3% directly controlled by the Japanese executives. But there is also a 31% block of shares owned by 130 employees that is represented by a single union delegate whos been siding with Dong-bin. Should the delegates vote be broken up, Dong-joo said he could get the majority he needs.Dong-joo declined to specify how hed change the employee voting system, which was set up by his father decades ago, but said there are legal steps that his team is working on. His supporters include Min Euoo-sung, 62, the former Korea Development Bank chairman who placed a failed bid for Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. before its bankruptcy, and Cho Moon-hyun, an attorney at DW Partners.Lotte said the employee union sided with Dong-bin in light of his managerial skills, while Dong-joo should be ashamed of losing the support of the Lotte Holdings staff. Union representatives werent available to comment.Dong-joo says his brother is only a pawn in a battle being controlled by Tsukuda and Kobayashi. As he tells it, the majority of votes at Lotte Holdings are effectively controlled by the Japanese executives as his younger brother only holds 1.6% of the voting rights.They can fire my brother anytime, Dong-joo said. My brothers position is not stable. While the brothers feud rages, Lotte is facing other crises.Corruption indictmentsIn October, South Korean prosecutors indicted five members of the family, including both brothers and their father, after a four-month investigation, accusing the Shin clan of engaging in financial crimes amounting to almost 280 billion won. Dong-joo was also charged with embezzling 39 billion won, which he denies. Lotte Group said most of the allegations against his brother, Dong-bin, involve events during the time their father was running the group. Other family members could not be reached for comment.Separately, Dong-bin had to answer allegations from parliament, along with other chaebol leaders, that Lotte and the other big business groups gave bribes to foundations controlled by Choi Soon-sil, the confidante of impeached Korean President Parkaccusations Dong-bin and Lotte Group deny.The scandals have taken a toll on Lottes businesses. The company scrapped a potential $4.5 billion initial public offering of a hotel unit and withdrew a multi-billion-dollar bid for chemicals-maker Axiall Corp. Prior to its deals freeze, Lotte was the most active Korean conglomerate in terms of mergers and acquisitions over the past six years, according to corporate watchdog CEOScore.For Dong-joo, the crises at Lotte are representative of what he says are managements missteps. He says he has a message for his estranged brother, with whom he hasnt spoken in months. Youd better apologize to my father and come back to Shin family, Dong-joo said. As a family, we should be united. BloombergGrace Huang also contributed to this story.",2016-12-16,644n0DkZZlIjzpFHzGm9bN,"Billionaire Shin Dong-joo says hes confident hell clear his name in court, overthrow his brother as chairman and seize control of Lotte Group that generates more revenue than Google or Airbus ",18:58,Inside a banished Korean billionaires plot to overthrow his brother

-0.4,"New Delhi: Winter heating to counter a severe cold wave sweeping across north India has driven up power demand beyond what was seen in previous years, sending power distributors in the region scurrying to negotiate arrangements to prepare for contingencies.
				   
				Delhis peak power demand this winter is expected to be around 4,500-4,600 mega watt (MW), compared to around 4,125MW a year ago, according to a spokesperson for two units of BSES promoted by Reliance Infrastructure Ltd supplying power in the National Capital Region (NCR). Peak winter power demand in NCR which has steadily risen from 3,678MW in 2010, has already crossed last years winter peak. Last summer, peak demand had touched 6,188MW in the capital on 20 May, about a quarter more than the peak summer demand around the same time a year ago. Energy demand peaks in mornings and early night hours compared to the average level of supply and forms a component in the electricity tariff to the consumer. It makes sense for a consumer to keep her peak demand lower as power generation companies have to  invest in extra capacity required to service the peak demand which remains idle at other times. According to Praveer Sinha, chief executive officer and managing director at Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd, Delhi may see a rise in winter peak power demand as compared to previous years due to the persistent cold wave. We all are experiencing a dip in the temperature to the coldest minimum since 2013, which has led to the increase in demand. At Tata Power-DDL, we have made prior arrangements to meet the rising demand...We have tied up through long-term power supply, banking as well as procurement on short term though the exchange, said Sinha.ALSO READ | Indias five hottest years since 1901 came in past 15 years, IMD data showsPower banking is a barter system of supplying excess power available to a distribution company to a counterpart which can be sourced back at another season at no cost. Distribution firms serving in plains strike such deals with those in hill states where power demand is more in winter and less in summer.Besides long-term arrangements, we are also using techniques like banking and backdown to dispose of surplus power and making arrangements to get power during summer months. In case of any unforeseeable contingency, BSES discoms will buy short-term power from the exchange which is available at economical rates, said the company spokesperson. BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd will bank the surplus of around 200MW with states like Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Meghalaya. BSES Yamuna Power Ltd (BYPL) has arranged for an additional 150MW from Punjab for December and January. To reduce the night surplus, BYPL will supply around 175MW to Bihar between December and March, said the spokesperson. This year, winter came late in the north and central parts of India. Two sets of cold waves, first between 11-15 January and the second between 18-19 January led to a severe fall in temperature across many parts of north and central India. In the first spell, Delhis minimum temperature dropped to 3.4 degrees Celsius on 12 January, the lowest in January in three years. Churu in Rajasthan recorded a minimum temperature of -1.9°C, seven degrees below average, making it the coldest city in the country on 12 January.According to India Meteorological Department, another cold wave will grip the northern parts of the country in the next few days which would lead to a fall in temperature.

0.62,"Tough negotiations are under way between GAIL (India) Ltd and two bidding groups that applied to charter nine new liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers required by the state-run gas processor and distributor for shipping gas from the US.
				   
				The intense bargaining is over the three LNG tankers that are to be built in India as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modis Make in India programme. The two consortiums comprising mainly Japanese fleet owners with a strong presence in LNG shipping want GAIL or the government to take on potential risks associated with the Indian-built LNG tankers, which would be the first such sophisticated ships built locally. GAIL doesnt want to assume the risks and is waiting for the government to take a position.A consortium of Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd (MOL)-Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha Ltd (NYK Line) and Mitsui and Co. Ltd and another group comprising Mitsubishi Corp.-Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd (K Line)-GasLog Ltd and Foresight Ltd are eyeing the long-term deal because of its sheer sizeworth around $7 billion. Such long-term shipping contracts translate into huge cost savings for GAIL and for the end-use consumers of LNG, a clean source of fuel which India is seeking to rely on to cut carbon emissions.Executives briefed on the tender issued by GAIL for the second time in two years (the first one failed because no one showed up), says there was an attempt by global shipowners to scuttle the bidding process and the Make in India plan by putting conditions that either GAIL or the government may find it difficult to accept.Conversations with these executives, who declined to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media, gives an insight into the role played by local representatives (mostly looking after crewing and other ship agency functions and not well versed with ship construction) of bidding groups in influencing their top bosses in the Tokyo headquarters on the perils of building LNG ships in India and to avoid taking perceived risks associated with this. A GAIL executive summed this up pretty well by saying that the company faced more resistance in pursuing the tender from the local representatives of the bidding groups than from senior executives based in Japan.To illustrate the point, a local representative with one of the bidding groups voiced concern during a meeting on the possible de-hiring of Indian-built LNG ships by GAIL, citing the example of Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd, which a few months ago prematurely cancelled contracts on ships taken on a long-term basis to support its oil exploration activities after daily rentals crashed due to a plunge in crude prices. However, those were small and old vessels which cannot be compared with the sheer scale of the Make in India project, intended to promote local manufacturing.Initially, even GAIL was not willing to get three of the nine LNG ships built in India, but had to change course following a directive from the ministry of petroleum and natural gas.Similarly, fleet owners were extremely reluctant to build these tankers in India due to concerns over construction time line, quality issues and risks associated with running such ships. Again, they had to relent after the government clearly indicated that it was going to use its LNG buying clout to get local yards to enter the highly lucrative LNG shipbuilding business.The LNG cargo purchasing power has been used by other nations such as South Korea and China to promote and augment their local shipping fleet or to build ships locally.Much has happened since the plan was unveiled. Indias state-owned Cochin Shipyard Ltd has managed to get a technology tie-up with South Koreas Samsung Heavy Industries Co. Ltd to build the LNG carriers. It has also secured a licence from French firm GTT to use its patented Mark-III LNG containment systems.It is imperative for both the government/GAIL and the bidders to meet half way to make this a reality. There should be give and takes in such an exercise; thats how plans such as Make in India can work.It would be childish on the part of global fleet owners to assume that Indian-built LNG ships may lack quality and run into operational problems, resulting in financial implications for them.After all, even the Japanese and the South Koreans, who are reputed LNG shipbuilders in the world today, got started at some point. There is always a first time.Having said that, the government and GAIL should not let go of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to start building LNG ships locally for want of a final push in the last lap of the tendering process.There are many upsides to this, one among them being the huge employment it can generate, which is also a political plank of the government.The government needs to guard against those trying to derail the process.

0.56,"Beijing: China, the worlds biggest clean-energy investor, lowered its solar and wind power targets for 2020, a reflection of how record installations of renewables have overwhelmed the ability of the nations grid to absorb the new electricity.
				   
				China is now aiming for 110 gigawatts of solar power by 2020, a 27% reduction from an earlier target, according to a webcast posted on the website of the national energy administration that cited the agencys chief engineer, Han Shui. The nation reduced its goal for wind power by 16% to 210 gigawatts.While China has poured billions of dollars into clean energy in recent years, the ability to deliver the newly-generated electricity from where its produced to where its needed has lagged. The mismatch has left solar and wind capacity sitting idle in some parts of the country, hurting companies such as China Longyuan Power Group Corp. and China Datang Corp. Renewable Power Co.The global large solar energy valuation peers index, which counts many Chinese manufacturers among its 20 members, has slumped 42% this year.The target reduction, which was largely expected by the solar industry, comes at a time when concerns about oversupply are pressuring solar stocks, analysts Ben Kallo and Tyler Frank of Robert W. Baird & Co. wrote in a 7 November note. Utility-scale projects will likely be most affected, and rooftop remains a potential source of upside.Earlier targetThe government earlier expected to have 150 gigawatts of solar power and 250 gigawatts of wind by 2020, PVnews.cn reported last year, citing Zhu Ming, deputy director of renewable energy department at the NEA.The lower targets were immediately criticized by some environmental groups who said the new goals arent good enough.The wind power capacity targets do not reflect the reality of the sectors growth and solar targets fail to expand the sector beyond its record 2015 growth, Greenpeace East Asia said in an e-mailed statement.Given the urgency of combating air pollution and climate change, we would expect the government to accelerate investments in clean energy, rather than stabilize or slow down, Greenpeace said.Since 2012, solar capacity has surged more than seven-fold, while wind has almost doubled amid a push by China to generate 15% of its power from renewable energy and nuclear by 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The rapid growth in capacity has left China struggling to integrate power supplies from renewable sources even as the government continues to promote clean energy as an alternative to more polluting fuels like coal and natural gas.China idled 33.9 billion kilowatt-hours of wind power last year, up 69% from a year earlier, the NEA said in August. Idled capacity at solar farms has also begun to appear, especially in the nations northwest, it said.Still, even with the lowered ambitions, China is due to see a surge in new clean-energy capacity. Solar will more than double by 2020 from 2015 levels, while wind will increase by 50%, according to Bloomberg new energy finance data.Bloomberg ",2016-11-08,6dL5kbnR8Dch5CNNjSrv9M,"Now, China aims for 110 gigawatts of solar power by 2020, a 27% reduction from an earlier target",16:24,"China scales back solar, wind ambitions as renewables cool"
1.0,"Bengaluru: A little over two decades back, K.R.Sridhar worked on a NASA mission to convert Martian atmospheric gases to oxygen for propulsion and life support. His work was so ahead of its time that Fortune magazine called him one of the top five futurists inventing tomorrow, today.
				   
				Fast forward to 2016, and the Indian-born rocket scientist-turned-entrepreneur is on a completely different mission: to provide clean, reliable energy for all on Earth.Sridhar, who founded Silicon Valley-based Bloom Energy that makes electricity from (solid oxide) fuel cells using natural gas, has finally brought the technology to India.In an interview with Mint, he talked about how it all started, the efficiency of green technology, why India needs it now more than ever and how it will navigate a few challenges unique to Asias third-largest economy. Edited excerpts:How did Bloom Energy come about?I started out trying to figure out how to create oxygen on Mars, and then along the way, to create water, breathing air, electricity and all those things so that you can think of a sustainable habitat. So I was working on that, but clearly American interest in space exploration started waning after the Cold War because we had other interests and other places to spend our money on. So I realized that seeing a human mission to Mars is not going to happen within the time frame, maybe not in my lifetime. So I started thinking of what I could do that could be impactful. I realized that water and energy are the biggest issues we are going to face in the next 100 years, given that we will get to 10 billion people on the planet. I also knew that if I had cleaner electricity, I could always provide clean water.What do you want to accomplish in India?India is a perfect place for us to prove our basic value proposition: which is you need to decentralize before you distribute it. India has proven that more than any other countryboth in computing and in telecom. If you think about supply of electricity and given when it is available, the extremely bad quality of that supply and the extreme environmental impact of that supply, we can take a page from computing and apply it to power and create distributed, sustainable power all over the country. It can become the model for the rest of the world to follow.Is it hard to sell your technology in a country like India?It is harder and easier. Its harder because until now the gas infrastructure did not exist and there wasnt a company like GAIL telling people, you buy this and we will provide the infrastructure for you and we will provide a reliable supply of gas for you. So it was hard. It is easier because in a place like the US, while they are hurling towards technology and are not afraid of new technology, the grid was fairly adequate and there was enough access to power and there wasnt a demand-supply mismatch. Whereas here, you are offering people power against not having power. So, its easier from that perspective. So it is both.There are many who think that a decentralised (generation and distribution) model will not work for gas-based technologies in India, but only in markets similar to the US. What are your thoughts?Natural gas will be the most abundantly available fuel in the 21st century for electric power generation around the world. This abundance will result in increasingly improved economics and an expanded global export market. Add the fact that natural gas is the lowest carbon fossil fuel and you have a very attractive fuel for power generation. This is the significance of our partnership with GAIL which is committed to expanding the natural gas infrastructure for decentralized power generation in India. With this, we believe that decentralised gas-fuelled power generation has a bright future in India and will help this country make the same kind of technology leapfrog in power generation from centralized to distributed that we have seen in telephonythe country avoided the fixed infrastructure investments of landline telephones and went straight to mobile.Your tariffs are still considerably above other alternate sources of power.The important question is what you are providing. Do they find the value in what you are doing. You may have a (cheaper) solar power plan, but with a solar panel on your roof, if you cannot turn on the lights in the night, when the sun is not shining, that power is not of much use to you. It doesnt matter what it costs.You may get a (cheaper) coal power plan because of which your child can study because the lights are on, but if that childs life is going to be reduced by 10 years because of all the pollution it puts up, you are going to wonder if that is the best alternative.A household may think, cheap power is good enough, why do I need more. The average life of all their appliances in their house is going down so fast because of problems with voltage and stability. They are never able to calculate the cost associated with that. They sometimes dont realize that they are paying significantly more for a refrigerator because the company had to build all these additional band-aids for that power, to make sure the warranty problem doesnt come to them and charge them more. It is about total overall value, as opposed to the essential value of commodities. That is an education that we have to do.We absolutely know that we have a learning curve and a cost curve. We are confident that over a few years with scale, people will use us not just because of all the positive attributes we bring, but also be cause we are the most affordable.How do you plan to procure biogas? Though GAIL has promised you natural gas, you will need more supply. So think of this1.3, fast forward 1.4 billion people in the nationthe amount of human waste, the amount of animal waste that comes from supporting this, the amount of plant waste that comes from supporting the animals and the plants is gigantic and it is either a liability or can be converted into an asset. And to us, it should be an asset and that becomes the biogas fuel. In the past, it was always a problem because the power plants were very, very large and you needed to go long distances to collect the biomass, bringing it to a huge centralized base and the cost of carrying it over a long distance was incredible.But, in the distributed Bloom model, people can take their own bio-waste and put that into their own bio-mass plant, generate their own biogas and produce their own power. And, in a true Gandhian way, can have a completely sustained solution.Are you happy with GAILs infrastructure in Bengaluru (where Bloom is powering technology company Intels R&D lab)?I dont think GAIL will say they are happy with it because they are aggressively trying to get into Bangalore, and as you know, in any big city like Bangalore, there are issues of being able to lay a pipeline quickly and all that. However, what I am extremely impressed with is the aggressive speed and passion with which they want to get it done, in spite of obstacles.What incentives are you offering to get more companies to sign up?You do that when you dont believe in your product. Our product more than speaks for itself. We are satisfying an unmet need. Those corporate customers have a root canal. I am offering them a pain killer. I dont need to discount it.But, if you look at the US, places where it worked were states where there were incentives or subsidies. Isnt it?True, there are different ways to look at it. If it were a level-playing field, we would require more subsidies. Because everyone else is subsidized. Not giving a subsidy to us puts us on an uneven playing field. That is the reason we need subsidies in the US.Could you eventually think of powering individual homes too?It may not be the best thing because if you think of individual homes, the evenings and mornings, when you do all these things, that (is when) you may be consuming power. It may be capital inefficient for you to have a piece of equipment that is not working for you all the time. It will better for a cluster of homes and businesses to be in a little micro-grid. I think thats a better solution than having a little box in every home.Where exactly will your fuel cell packs be installed?It should be right where you use it and where its under your control. Typically, you never did that because these power generators were noisy, they vibrated and so you liked to put it far awayout of sight, out of mind. Here is a beautiful looking piece of equipment, children can play around it, people can have a picnic table around it. You can put it on a rooftop, on a basement or next to a parking lot. For the same amount of energy that you can produce, we require 120 times less land. So, (while) land use is a big issue usually (with respect to  power generation), this is a non-issue for us.When are you going public?Going public is just a step of a long process for a company. It is not even the beginning to the end, its just one small step. When we are ready, we will do it. We are definitely closer to it than we were.People can think what they want. It is a private company and our stakeholdersour investors, customers and employeesare all happy with the path we have taken.Are you profitable?We can state with no uncertainty that if we dont find a path to make our own company sustainable, we cannot make the planet sustainable. We have a path for sustainability, both for us and our planet. Being a private company we dont discuss these things.Can you tell me about your energy capacity? Where do you see it in five years?We are very actively engaged in building a pipeline for customers. We have actively started engaging with prospective customers. Obviously in the regions where natural gas is available like Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad. Places like that where there is both an availability of natural gas and a supply-demand mismatch, where electricity is a problem. Hopefully, next year, when you see me, the numbers will be impressive.Could you possibly look at local manufacturing of fuel cells to bring costs down?We already manufacture some component systems in India and make use of supply chain partners which also contribute Make in India manufactured goods which are incorporated into our systems. As the market develops in India and volume justifies it, we expect more Make in India content in our systems.Will Bloom Energy seek to source biogas from local plants for generation of electricity if enough natural gas is not available?This is among the options we are considering, especially in more rural areas.How do you plan to raise funds?As a private company, we dont discuss our funding requirements. We are a very healthy company, well-positioned to execute our business plan.Costs associated with building and maintaining fuel cells are pretty high. How can you change that?We are already economically attractive for certain types of customersthose commercial or government entities that have significant business critical operations that cannot suffer interruption of power. Like any new, transformative technology, Blooms technology is riding a steep cost-down path as innovation and market volume forces come together to bring down cost. We are extremely confident that this trend will continue for many years.How do you rate India companies when it comes to sustainability initiatives?We applaud that sustainability is an increasing focus for India Inc. Much is left to be done and the challenge is significant to improving the sustainability of business operations in India and for the society.What are the three biggest problems with Indias power infrastructure?We see the three biggest challenges as lack of access and adequate supply of electric power to fully support the society, challenges with power reliability and power outages, and still high CO2, high nox (oxides of Nitrogen), sox (oxides of sulphur) and particulate emissions relative to what is possible today with an advanced technology such as Bloom.Whats your advice to young entrepreneurs?Pick something you are passionate (about), because there are so many ups and downs. To be able to still go ahead, that passion needs to be strong. It should be yours and not someone elses.(Theres) nothing wrong in being a capitalist, nothing wrong in wanting to make money. But money is a lot more satisfying, if you also find something that has a social impact.Gireesh Chandra Prasad in New Delhi contributed to this story",2016-10-17,6p08znifFPuASBf1TXMe6I,"KR Sridhar talks about the efficiency of green technology, why India needs it and how Bloom Energy will navigate through challenges unique to the country",01:17,Decentralized gas-fuelled power generation has a bright future: Bloom Energy CEO
0.22,"Mumbai: State-owned fuel retailers are planning to approach the government to compensate them for their losses while giving a 0.75% discount for cashless payments, two people aware of the matter said.
				   
				In the wake of demonetisation, the government on 8 December announced a discount of 0.75% for purchase of auto fuel using credit and debit cards and e-wallets at fuel stations run by Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corp.  Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd. The  discount came into effect on 13 December 2016. We may reach out to the government seeking compensation on the revenue losses arising out of the 0.75% discount we are currently providing. We plan to approach the government in a few months, said the first of the two officials cited above, an executive from one of the oil marketing companies, on condition of anonymity. A Mint report last month quoted OMCs as saying that the discounts could dent the revenue by around Rs1,100 crore till March. If the discount period is extended by another  quarter, it would double. The OMCs said they do not want the discount period extended. While marketing business (which includes fuel retailing) forms 18% of volumes for IOCL, at BPCL and HPCL, it forms 40-50%. Religare Institutional Research in a report dated 9 December said, Assuming 70% of transactions at OMC outlets go digital, IOCL, BPCL and HPCL could see a worst-case earnings hit of 8-14% in FY18 if they are unable to pass on these costs (which is unlikely). There are additional benefits of improved transparency and efficiency.The OMCs did not reply to an email sent on Thursday morning.I think the discount helps our marketing strategy. It will bring more customers to us who can experience our services, if they already have not. We will have to see if the government agrees to compensate us for the losses, said the second official, another OMC executive, on condition of anonymity. For OMCs,  diesel forms 70% of sales.  Assuming 70% of all transactions at fuel outlets move to the digital medium, the net discount for petrol/diesel works out to Rs0.3/litre. This can be comfortably passed on, as OMCs have been able to raise gross marketing margins in these products from Rs1 per litre to Rs2.6 per litre over the last three years, added Religare Institutional Research in its report. The OMCs operate (owned and co-owned with dealers) a network of 52,000 retail outlets, with annual sales of 92 billion litres of diesel and 31 billion litres of petrol (FY17E). OMCs said on Thursday that post-demonetisation, they have seen e-transactions go up by 50% in cities and around 30% in semi-rural areas. However, many rural areas are yet to start with digital payments. OMCs said many rural outlets do not have the means to accept digital payments. Once that is facilitated, the number of transactions would go up.Kotak Securities in a report dated 27 December said, IOCL management indicated that it has not received any clarification from the government on compensation for discounts on fuel sales through digital means. However, the company will be able to recover the incidental loss through reduction in transaction costs and modestly higher marketing margins on overall sales, if not compensated adequately. OMCs expect that once people get used to the e-transactions, the discounts would cease.",2017-01-20,6u1ZK0NzOfqJ9BwYwQWWoL,State-owned firms aim to approach government in a few months over the 0.75% discount for cashless payments at fuel outlets,01:13,Cashless discounts: Fuel retailers may ask govt for compensation
0.36,"New Delhi: Government has formally granted a licence to BP Plc, Europes third-biggest oil company, to set up 3,500 petrol pumps in India, making it the 10th company to enter the lucrative fuel retailing sector. 
				   
				The company was granted a formal licence on 14 October. BP granted licence to market Motor Spirit (petrol) and High Speed Diesel (diesel)another milestone for BP in India, the company tweeted. The UK-based firm, as also Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd, was given approval by the oil ministry to retail petrol and diesel, officials said. A significant step in #BPs partnership with Indiabeen granted licence to market Motor Spirit and High Speed Diesel, it said. A BP India spokesperson had earlier this month stated that: BP sees a strong future for transportation fuels in India. We are keen to be involved in this market and contribute to its development. The company had in January this year won in-principle approval to retail aviation turbine fuel (ATF) to airlines in India. Subsequently, it got full approval for that. We can confirm we have been granted approval for marketing for ATF, the BP spokesperson said. For a licence to retail auto fuelspetrol, diesel and ATF, a company should have invested a minimum of Rs2,000 crore in exploration or production of oil and gas, oil refining, gas or product pipeline or terminals leading to additionally to the existing assets or creation of new assets in the eligible activities. BP, which had in 2011 bought 30% interest in 21 exploration blocks of Reliance Industries for $7.2 billion, had cited investment of nearly $500 million in oil and gas exploration and production for gaining the licence. India currently has about 56,190 petrol pumps, with public sector firms operating a majority of them. Private sector operators are limited to Essar Oil and Reliance Industries, who between them have some 3,500 petrol pumps. Royal Dutch Shell operates 82 petrol stations. Numaligarh Refineries Ltd (NRL) and Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) are late entrants and have six outlets between them. State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) owns 25,363 petrol pumps, Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) 13,802 stations and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) 13,439 outlets. Kolkata-based Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd (HPL) was the latest company to get licence to set up upto 100 petrol pumps, mostly in West Bengal. In ATF or jet fuel retailing, there are 205 aviation fuel stations, 100 of which are owned by IOC, 40 by BPCL and 37 by HPCL.

0.9,"Ousted Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry was pushing C. Sivasankaran, who had played dealmaker in several Tata group transactions in the past, to pay up the Siva groups share of the DoCoMo award, and also discussed with the board of the holding company possible legal action against the sometimes controversial, Seychelles-based entrepreneur, documents seen by Mint show.
				   
				On 15 September, at his penultimate Tata Sons board meeting as chairman, Mistry raised this issue, the documents show. He was removed as chairman when the board next met on 24 October.Interestingly, on 19 September, Tata Sons (Tata Teleservices Ltd and NTT DoCoMo Inc. are named as co-respondents) received a legal notice from a firm retained by Sivasankarans Sterling Info-tech Ltd, alleging mismanagement of Tata Teleservices and reserving the right to seek damages to recover its (Sterlings) losses.Mint learns that a decision on how to respond to this email had not been taken till Mistrys exit.Tata group spokesperson Debasis Ray said in an email response to Mints queries that in 2008, when Docomo agreed to acquire shares of Tata Teleservices, Tata Sons voluntarily offered other shareholders of TTSL an opportunity for a pro-rata sale of their holdings. This was subject to the shareholders agreeing to bear a pro-rata portion of any claims or amounts payable to Docomo should such an event arise.... Thereafter in 2014, Docomo exercised the put option. In terms of the agreement with the selling shareholders, Tata Sons demanded from Mr Sivasankaran his pro-rata share of the amount payable to Docomo.Ray added that Tata Sons is pursuing all legal options for recovery of this amount.Mint couldnt ascertain whether the company had responded to Sivasankarans notice. Sivasankaran could not be reached for comment immediately.The notice from Sivasankarans law firm mentions his long-standing association with the Tata Group of Companies on account of his close association with Mr Ratan Tata.Sivasankaran has had several dealings with the group, taking Barista, Indias first coffee chain that the Tata group had acquired, off its hands, selling Dishnet DSL to the Tata-owned VSNL, which subsequently became Tata Communications, and facilitating the sale of the Tata stake in the Birla-Tata-AT&T telecom venture to the Aditya Birla Group, resulting in the formation of Idea Cellular Ltd.In early 2006, the Siva group acquired 520 million shares in Tata Teleservices at Rs 17 per share or Rs884 crore. It paid Rs102 crore towards this, the documents show. It paid the balance in February 2006. Of the Rs782 crore, the documents show that Rs650 crore was funded by a loan from Standard Chartered Bank effectively guaranteed by Tata Sons. The balance Rs132 crore came from Kalimati Investments, a subsidiary of Tata Steel.Ray confirmed both and said that to ensure that in the event of a default on the repayment of the loan, the shares of Tata Teleservices were not sold to a third party, Tata Sons agreed to an arrangement whereby the bank would sell the shares to Tata Sons.He added that a part of the consideration was funded by another Tata company for a few days on market-linked terms.In 2006, when the loan was refunded, the Tata group withdrew this guarantee, and the Siva group had to provided other collateral to the bank, the documents show.Then came the 2008 deal with DoCoMo under which the latter bought shares amounting to 26% of Tata Teleservices equity. Of the 26%, 20% was to be fresh equity and 6%, a sale by existing shareholders. Under this, the documents with Mint show, Sivasankaran sold 20.74 million shares at Rs117.81 apiece, turning a tidy profit.The DoCoMo investment eventually turned sour, and with no initial public offering in sight, the Japanese company exercised a put option. The resulting litigation led to an award of Rs8,450 crore to DoCoMo. Of this, the Siva groups share was Rs694 crore.The September legal notice from the Siva group and a letter to Mistry in October 2013 from Sivasankaran refer to Tata Teleservicess dire need for equity, and present the Siva groups investment in the company as a sort of lifeline.This representation was disputed by Mistry in his response to the letter. I have been advised by Mr (Ratan) Tata that the investment made by the Siva Group was made principally on the consideration that the telecom sector was fast-growing and represented a good investment opportunity. In his letter, Sivasankaran referred to an earlier letter to Ratan Tata in 2011 seeking assistance in finding a buyer for the Siva groups holding in Tata Teleservices.He further asks Mistry for a fair resolution (presumably a buyback of his holdings) in line with the mutually benevolent relation between the Tata group and Siva group which made the Siva group walk the extra miles to support the Tata group by undertaking risks which no financial investor acting in self-interest would.From Rays comments, it looks like that resolution is headed for the courts.",2016-11-09,8UuRA0q7zaqX07hXw3QxPL,"At his penultimate Tata Sons board meeting as chairman, Cyrus Mistry raised the issue, the documents show",01:31,Cyrus Mistry was trying to get Siva group to pay share of DoCoMo award
-0.8,"London: Oil bounced back from a one-week low on Thursday as the International Energy Agency (IEA) said global oil markets were tightening even before cuts promised by organisation of petroleum exporting countries (Opec) and other producers could take shape. 
				   
				Oil prices have gyrated this year as the markets focus has swung from hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and others producers to fears that a rebound in US shale production could swamp any such reductions.Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, was up 27 cents at $54.19 a barrel by 3.45pm after closing down 2.8% in the previous session. US West Texas Intermediate crude oil was up 25 cents at $51.33 per barrel, having dropped to a one-week low on Wednesday at $50.91 a barrel.The IEA said that while it was far too soon to gauge Opec members levels of compliance with promised cuts, commercial oil inventories in the developed world fell for a fourth consecutive month in November, with another decline projected for December. It raised its 2016 demand growth estimate, and said the data indicated that rising demand was slowly tightening global oil markets.Still, analysts warned that keeping to the cuts was crucial, particularly as a resilient US shale industry threatened to add more barrels to the market. Discipline and strict adherence to the new quotas will be needed probably throughout 2017 and beyond to see the long-awaited and sustainable rebalancing finally arrive, PVM Oil Associates analyst Tamas Varga said in a note. Opec itself said its cuts would help balance the market, and said its output had already fallen in December. But it also pointed to the possibility of a rebound in US output amid higher oil prices. Stocks data coming out of the United States sent more mixed signals. American Petroleum Institute (API) data on Wednesday showed that US crude stocks fell by 5.04 million barrels in the week to 13 January, well above the expectations of a 342,000-barrel decline.But the data also showed larger-than-expected, and potentially bearish, increases in stocks of gasoline and distillates.

-0.09,"Mumbai: Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has requested the petroleum ministry to remove the cap on the quantity of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) that the company is permitted to sell through its own parallel marketing channel, two people aware of the development said.
				   
				In a notification on 29 July 2015, the ministry had directed RIL, which sells LPG cylinders under the Reliance Gas brand, to restrict its own marketing of domestically produced LPG to 10,000 tonnes per month.RIL has approached the ministry requesting them to remove the cap of 10,000 tonnes per month altogether, said the first person mentioned abovean official from an oil marketing company who declined to be identified.Although the ministry has not heeded RILs request so far, there are continuous follow-ups by the company, the person added.RIL did not respond to an email questionnaire sent on 27 December. As per the LPG Control Order on regulation of supply and distribution, issued by the petroleum ministry in 2000, all cooking gas produced domestically must be supplied to state-run oil marketing companiesBharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC). As per the ministrys order, RIL sells the LPG produced at its two refineries at Jamnagar, Gujarat, to public sector retailers. However, under a Parallel Marketing Scheme (PMS), private companies are allowed to import and market LPG to bulk consumers.In July 2016, RIL launched its small-capacity 5-kg cylinders, which qualify as free trade LPG (FTL). This means they are not subsidised by the government, unlike the commonly used 14.2-kg domestic cylinders. The larger capacity cylinders are sold at market price to consumers who have the option of receiving a government subsidy in their bank accounts. Private firms are not entitled to government subsidies, unlike state-run oil marketing companies, and have to sell fuel at market price. But with the governments bid to restrict the volume of subsidy by barring consumers earning more than Rs10 lakh per annum from taking advantage of subsidised LPG, an attractive market for LPG has opened up to private players such as RIL.",2017-01-10,8sPLXhCZngGwbtYpj8eYWN,"RIL plea comes following a Central govt notification that the Reliance Gas brand to restrict its own marketing of domestically produced LPG to 10,000 tonnes per month",09:58,RIL seeks removal of LPG cap

				The government is going the extra mile to facilitate tie-ups among the major players to ensure that investments flow into these blocks at a time global energy firms are cutting back on capital spending because of sustained bearishness in oil and gas prices. The offer, which was to be originally concluded on 31 October, has been extended to 21 November to make sure those who have shown interest in the road shows in September and October get enough time to study geological data and finalise their bids, said an official, requesting anonymity.The blocks are estimated to hold over 625 million barrels of in-place oil and oil equivalent gas, spread over 1,500 sq. km. The blocks with many hydrocarbon discoveries are offered under liberal contractual terms. The fields were earlier returned to the government by state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. for unviable administered price of gas that prevailed. To sweeten the offer, the government has permitted free pricing of gas as well as freedom to sell the fuel to any customer without government intervention.This is a departure from the practice of the authorities setting a list of priority industries such as fertilizers, liquified petroleum gas, power and condensed natural gas for allocation of gas from fields auctioned under the previous licensing policy. The present auction of hydrocarbon resources, the first since 2010, is a litmus test for the government, keen to increase fuel production and reduce Indias import dependence from 77% to 67% by 2022.Many potential investors who attended road shows have expressed interest in larger blocks as those on offer are small and marginal ones. We will be offering larger ones once the current exercise is concluded, said the official quoted above. Upstream oil and gas regulator, the Director General of Hydrocarbons Atanu Chakraborty told Mint in an interview on 30 September that rules are being framed for offering Indias entire unexplored sedimentary basins in one go to investors, who could chose the assets they want under the new open acreage policy approved by the cabinet in March. The basis of that is the national data repository (NDR), which is in a very advanced stage of completion. Now we are entirely focused on making the auction of discovered small fields a success. It will yield a lot of learning too. This campaign has all the components of the new hydrocarbon exploration licensing policy (HELP)--it offers a unified licence for all forms of hydrocarbons, free pricing, market access and revenue sharing terms. The Indian market is a fast growing one and any investor with a long-term view should come to India now, said Chakraborty.

-0.19,"The broad reading is that gas companies results for the December quarter are likely to be relatively weak. 
				   
				City gas distributorsIndraprastha Gas Ltd (IGL) and Mahanagar Gas Ltd (MGL) had delivered a good financial performance for the half year ended September. But both companies are expected to suffer the adverse consequences of demonetization on compressed natural gas (CNG) demand during the December quarter. As a result, there could be some negative impact on CNG volume growth. Further, reduced traffic during high smog days in the quarter is also expected to weigh on IGLs results.According to Edelweiss Securities Ltd, IGLs Ebitda margin will be squeezed, given the increase in spot/term LNG (liquefied natural gas) price, while realization has been cut following the 18% reduction in domestic gas price. For MGL, we are estimating Ebitda/standard cu. m (scm) to contract 12% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) to Rs6/scm, said Edelweiss Securities in its results preview.Ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.The results of Petronet LNG Ltd, too, are likely to be comparatively subdued, after a fabulous performance in the first half of FY17. For one, spot LNG prices increased sharply during the December quarter, compared with the September quarter. And, then, LNG demand was below expectations. Citi Research expects lower utilization for Petronet LNG on the back of lower volumes (lower October and November imports on higher spot prices + competition from the Dabhol LNG terminal), driving a 16% q-o-q Ebitda decline.Meanwhile, volume offtake for GAIL (India) Ltds petrochemicals segment is expected to be adversely impacted due to demonetization. But the good news is earnings improvement is expected to sustain. GAILs earnings have been improving steadily since bottoming out in 1HFY16 and analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd expect the trend to continue with a 5% q-o-q increase in Ebitda. For the stock, investors will do well to follow the ramp-up of GAILs expanded petrochemical capacity at Pata in Uttar Pradesh.But investors have little to complain. After all, these stocks have performed well so far this fiscal. Stocks of Petronet LNG, IGL and GAIL have increased 44.7%, 62% and 29%, respectively. That compares favourably with the 6.7% gain in the benchmark Sensex during the same time frame. MGLs share price has doubled from its issue price of Rs421 a share. Even as that augurs well, valuations seem to be capturing a good chunk of the optimism.

				This is the second large set of orders KEC has won in two weeks. On 17 March, it had announced new orders worth Rs.1,041 crore.With the latest gain, the stock is up 23% from February lows, recouping almost half of the losses it saw earlier this year. It lost one-third of its value in January and February as the slump in crude oil prices stoked concerns about its business in the West Asian countries. Around 15% of KECs outstanding order book is from that region. In a conference call with analysts, KEC had said it is yet to see any slackening of its order pipeline in West Asia. But that did not cut much icethe stock fell after the third quarter results.Instead, what is helping the stock are strong order inflows and management commentary on prospects in India and other markets. The latest order wins comes on the back of a 26% rise in inflows till the first week of February. More than half of the 17 March orders are from overseas (Ghana, Americas). Last weeks orders are mostly from India. This lends credence to the belief that diversification (both geographical and in services) is helping KEC navigate the business environment better, especially the overseas markets from which it derives half of the business.The company is seeing large tenders opening in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. Operations in Mexico are turning around. In India, apart from transmission, opportunities are emerging in the railways and solar energy sectors. KEC highlighted it is also seeing healthy traction in solar and railway segments (tenders worth Rs.25 billion (Rs.2,500 crore) up for bidding), Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd said in a note.In 2016-17, KEC is targeting revenues to rise 10-12%, which will be a notable improvement from the year gone by. Revenues were flat, or increased just 0.2%, in the first nine months of 2015-16. From Rs.3,000 crore in February, KECs deal pipeline increased to Rs.4,200 crore, the company told ET Now. As these bids convert into orders, the order book will rise further.According to IndiaNivesh Securities Ltd, the outlook for KECs core transmission and distribution (T&D) business in India is strong with the sector estimated to see an investment of almost Rs.3 trillion over the next four years. So, even if West Asia sees any slowdown in T&D spends, KEC can maintain the revenue momentum.

-0.85,"London/ Singapore: Oil prices rose on Tuesday, supported by a falling US dollar and Saudi Arabia saying it would adhere to organisation of petroleum exporting countries (Opecs) commitment to cut output.
				   
				Gains were capped by rising US production and scepticism that the Opec as a whole would comply with its commitments to reduce supplies.Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were up 77 cents at $56.63 per barrel at 3.50pm. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 88 cents at $53.25 per barrel.The dollar, along with stocks and bond yields, fell across the board on Tuesday after US President-elect Donald Trump said that the strong greenback was hurting US competitiveness.Traders said oil drew some support from top crude exporter Saudi Arabia, which said it would adhere strictly to its commitment to cut output under the agreement between Opec and other producers like Russia.Under the agreement, Opec, Russia and other non-Opec producers have pledged to cut oil output by nearly 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd), initially for six months, to bring supplies back in line with consumption.The market genuinely seems quite happy here (around $55) ... but people are watching with caution as the slightest hint of this Opec/non-Opec agreement going wrong is going to drive the market down, said Matt Stanley, a fuel broker at Freight Investor Services (FIS) in Dubai.Despite this, crude futures have fallen 5%  since their early January peaks because of doubts over the oil producers willingness to fully comply with the cuts.Traders are also watching rising US output with interest, as this could offset supply cuts elsewhere. The market is focused on the build in US production which is nearly up to 9 million bpd - up from 8.5 million bpd last June and close to 2014 production levels, said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at Sydneys CMC Markets.With US crude clearly above $50 a barrel, we are getting a supply-side response which is pushing production higher, he said.Further weighing on crude, at least in the short term, have been refinery outages in the Middle East and Asia over the past week, traders said. Analysts also said that steps to prop up oil prices through a cut in supplies could be self-defeating.For each $10 per barrel increase in oil prices, oil demand will decline by 10 basis points. While consensus expects demand-growth of 1.3 million bpd in 2017 (vs 1.4 million bpd in 2016), we see risks to the downside as demand growth in China and India starts to moderate, AB Bernstein said.

0.03,"Mumbai: Clean energy companies and their investors are worried about rising instances of state power distribution utilities (discoms) unplugging their generating capacity from the grid and delaying both payments and the signing of power purchase agreements (PPAs). 
				   
				Two of Indias largest renewable energy companies, ReNew Power Ventures Pvt. Ltd and Tata Power Renewable Energy Ltd (TPREL), a subsidiary of Tata Power Co. Ltd, have been hit by such unplugging, also called back-down at their plants in multiple states, company officials said. Projects of other companies including Adani Green Energy Ltd and Hero Future Energies have also been hurt due to back-down and delays in signing PPAs, they added. Some states resort to backing down wind and solar projects, jeopardizing investments already made in the projects, said Rahul Shah, chief executive of TPREL. Discoms in Maharashtra, Tamilnadu, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have also been delaying payments to generators of wind and solar power by as much as 8-10 months, which puts their cash flows under tremendous pressure. These are negative signals for developers and investors who are evaluating the Indian market for investment in new renewable energy capacity, Shah said.According to ReNew Powers estimates, discoms in Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh owe wind energy producers over Rs4000 crore in payments. A ReNew spokesperson said about 500 megawatt (MW) of its solar capacity and a smaller size of wind capacity is stranded in Jharkhand due to delays in signing PPAs.A check of awarded projects shows 1200 MW of solar capacity of ReNew Power, Adani Power and ACME Solar and about 600 MW of wind capacity is stuck for the lack of PPAs in Jharkhand. Adani Power and Hero Future did not respond to emails seeking comment. Many discoms are in poor financial shape and have started going back on their commitment to sign PPAs with solar power producers, multiple people in the renewables business said. In solar projects, which are won through reverse bidding process, a PPA is signed ahead of completion of the project, usually for a period of 25 years. A back-down can happen due to availability of cheaper power elsewhere, lack of transmission infrastructure, absence of demand, or inability of the grid to buy power. Grids usually reserve the right to unplug power because of the variations in the amount of power generated. This practice, called power back-down, leads to losses of billions of units of green power.Several companies have filed petitions against a state utility in Rajasthan on account of this, an official of Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission said on condition of anonymity. Investors are losing confidence, said Seema Changlani, director of Beont Capital, which helps Indian companies set up projects and attract new investments. At times, the grid refuses to purchase renewable power in favour of cheaper thermal power. Investors finance projects on the basis of PPAs and absence of PPAs by discoms can hurt IRRs of these projects.Back-down and delay in payments have become a chronic problem, Dilip Nigam, adviser, ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE) said on the sidelines of an event in Mumbai on Wednesday. Discoms are backing down on renewable energy in the name of security of the grid and we have been taking up the issue separately. Renewable energy should have a must-run status. India has a total wind capacity of 27.4 gigawatt (GW) and solar capacity of about 9 GW. It has set itself the target of adding 100 GW of solar and 60 GW of wind capacity by 2022.The government has set a renewable purchase obligation target for discoms, but this target is not being met. This raises concerns over rising solar capacity and ability of the discoms to buy all of it. This (problem) is becoming bigger by the day, Vinay Rustagi, managing director, renewable energy focused consultancy Bridge to India said.The MNRE wrote to the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission in August highlighting the issue of back-downs. Tarun Kapoor, joint secretary, MNRE wrote in that letter that if any backing down has to be done, thermal power projects should be asked to back down so that some fuel is saved. This (loss of energy from backing down) can make solar power unattractive particularly when projects are being allotted through competitive bidding and tariffs have come down drastically, he wrote. They should be paid full tariff if they are forced to back down in rare cases.Solar energy tariffs have fallen from Rs15 over four years ago to below Rs5 per unit over the past 12 months, in part due to aggressive bidding in reverse auctions. Tariffs are expected to fall to Rs3.50 per unit in the next three years on account of falling cost of equipment and better technology, Mint reported on 26 July.",2016-10-21,ASu58DZtfl5xnomADH13wL,Rising instances of discoms unplugging generating capacity from grid and delaying signing of PPAs ,02:58,Renewable energy firms worry about back-down by power discoms
-0.76,"London/ Singapore: Oil prices rose for the first time in three days on Wednesday, following news of Saudi supply cuts to Asia, but persistent doubt over output reductions and signs of rising shipments from other producers kept gains in check.
				   
				Brent crude futures were up 41 cents at $54.05 a barrel by 5.03pm, while US West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up 39 cents at $51.21 a barrel.Brent has surrendered nearly 40% of the gains made between late November and early January. Analysts, however, said the slide was unlikely to become more aggressive, given the likelihood of Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbours at least sticking to their pledge to cut output. Few envision that Brent crude at sub-$50 a barrel is a viable price (in the first half of 2017) amid Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) production cuts tightening up the market, SEB commodities strategist Bjarne Schieldrop said.Whether last nights low of $53.58/barrel turns out to be the low point remains to be seen. However, we do think that buying in the territory between the current price of $53.88/b and down to $50/b is probably as good as it gets for buyers in H1.Saudi Arabia, the worlds top oil exporter, has told some of its Asian customers that it will reduce their crude supplies slightly in February. But there is still plenty of oil to fill the gaps left by the Opec. North American drilling is on the rise, while European and Chinese traders are shipping a record 22 million barrels of crude from the North Sea and Azerbaijan to Asia this month. There is still doubt among many market watchers over whether the planned cuts will be enough to rebalance a market that has been oversupplied for the past two years.Traders continued to fret about rising US supply and compliance by Opec to agreed-upon production cuts, ANZ bank said.The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Tuesday that crude production in the United States this year would rise by 110,000 barrels per day to 9 million bpd.Another concern is high US crude stockpiles, with the EIA scheduled to release its latest figures on Wednesday.

				Winning developers in Jharkhand state are still waiting to sign power purchase agreements almost a year after the tender. In March, Jharkhand awarded contracts to build 1.2 gigawatts (GW) of solar. The states power retailer, Jharkhand Bijli Vitran Nigam Ltd, was supposed to sign the power purchase agreements in May 2016.We have asked for financial assistance of a few hundred crore rupees from the states finance department and are awaiting their response, said R.K. Srivastava, chief secretary of the energy department in the state of Jharkhand.The delay underscores the threat from financially strapped state power retailers to Prime Minister Narendra Modis ambitious renewable energy goals. State-owned power retailers in India had combined losses of Rs3.84 trillion as of March 2015, according to a report by KPMG.Jharkhand Bijlis managing director, Rahul Kumar Purwar, couldnt be reached for comment.ReNew Power Ventures Pvt. Ltd, which is majority owned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. scooped up 522 MW in the March auction. ReNews other investors include the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the Global Environment Fund.Other winners included Suzlon Energy Ltd, OPG Power Ventures Plc, Acme Group, Adani Enterprises Ltd and SunEdison Inc.A Suzlon spokesperson was unavailable for comment. An email sent to the Adani Group wasnt returned. OPG Power executives couldnt be reached. In an email, ReNew Power executives declined to comment.Solar auctionHow much of the solar capacity awarded in Marchs tender eventually gets built depends on whether the government provides the backing, Srivastava said.Tariffs awarded in the auction ranged from Rs5.08 to Rs7.90 per kilowatt-hour depending on the size of the project, all of which were supposed to become operational between May and November this year.There is a huge difference between the average tariff of nearly Rs4.3 a unit, at which the discom buys power, and the rates quoted for solar energy in the auction last year, Srivastava said in a phone interview, referring to the term used to identify electricity distribution companies in India.The poor financial health of the countrys power retailers has been identified as one of the biggest hurdles to Modis climate pledge to install 175 GW of renewable capacity by 2022.Those losses mean discoms cant buy more electricity to satisfy expected demand whether clean or conventional, nor can they add more customers. That ultimately leaves latent power demand unmet.Several domestic and overseas clean energy companies have said they havent received payments for the electricity they generate for more than 10 months, racking up deficits of several hundred million dollars that may put the countrys green power ambitions at risk.Jharkhands state discom has liabilities of Rs6,400 crore, according to government data.

0.5,"As I write this, we are on the cusp of a green energy revolution.
				   
				Solar power is already cheaper than coal in most parts of the world and its likely to be the cheapest form of energy everywhere by the end of the decade. 2016 saw solar bids starting with $64 (around Rs4,300) per MWh in Rajasthan in the first quarter and crashing to $29.10 per MWh in Chile by August. Services in the city of Las Vegas are now powered entirely by renewable energy. In May, Portugal ran continuously on renewable energy for four-and-a-half days. Costa Rica barely used any fossil fuels in 2016. Tesla began manufacturing lithium ion batteries from its Gigafactory. Since 2010, Li+ battery costs have dropped at an astonishing 15-16% per year and could go down to as low as $150 by 2020, if not earlier. 2017 could be the watershed year for super-efficient solar panels.These are encouraging trends which hold out optimism for a green and decarbonized world. In the not-so-distant future, we will witness a breakthrough in low-carbon energy resources usage, a dramatic increase in the energy-efficiency of buildings, factories, appliances, gadgets, devices, etc., and an explosion in the electrification of the economy, from transportation to industry.Intermittency in wind and solar generation, a big hurdle for the propagation and adoption of renewable energy (RE), will be handled by self-thinking smart grids controlling geographically dispersed but interconnected wind, solar and water resources. Demand response management at the end-user level, through smart meters, will also help manage the uncertainty in RE power. Sophisticated behind the meter storage systems will shift consumption from peak to off-peak hours and help absorb excess RE generation, whereas utility-scale storage solutions will ensure grid stability and balancing. Even as grids move power over massive distances, the power landscape will also be abundantly dotted with microgrids, distributed generation and distributed storage. Just like the mobile phone revolution leapfrogged fixed-line telephony in developing countries, distributed generation is all set to take a similar giant leap to electrify homes without access to electricity. Home-based solar systems or local energy units built with solar panels, batteries and computers will give rise to a new energy infrastructure that will become mainstream. The cost of this will continue to decline as technology advances. The beauty of it all is that it will provide the impoverished in developing countries accelerated access to healthcare, education, food, water, shelter and sanitation, resulting in quantum progress in human development and well-being in the coming decade. There will be huge advances in energy-efficiency technologies and the integration of solar panels into everyday materials. Buildings will become net energy generators, with solar as the main source of energy. Solar modules on rooftops will be supplemented by solar windows and tiles. Solar windows or self-charging glasses will be adapted to self-charging mobiles, tablets and other such devices and gadgets. Who knows, even our clothes could become solar panels and charge our phones and other personal devices. Ultra-lightweight and flexible solar films will be used in rural areas and for portable projects. Solar panels are, in fact, now even being built into road surfaces, just in case we run out of empty spaces in future!I cannot visualize a green energy future without electric cars. Half of the worlds population will be living in cities in a decade. Electric cars are imperative for keeping the city air pollution-free. China has made the switch to electric vehicles a priority. Germany has passed a law banning oil cars by 2030, Norway plans to ban fossil fuel-powered cars in 2025 and Austria wants to ban them as soon as 2020. India too has expressed a similar intent.All this is good but it signifies a complicated change, and change is never easy. But renewable energy, and, most importantly, solar PV (photovoltaic) is to me an exponential technologylike computers, mobile phones, Internet, data storagewhich is all set to disrupt the conventional energy sector. The worlds smartest minds are working round the clock on green technologies. Hardly a day passes when we dont hear of a new innovation in renewable technology with regard to efficiency, cost, practicality, etc. Thousands of new jobs are being created every year by a clean-energy economy.All these developments are proving sceptics of renewable energy wrong.

0.6,"The Essar Group may have been in a debt trap, but there are no signs of distress in the Essar Oil Ltd sale to PJSC Rosneft Oil Co and a consortium led by commodities trader Trafigura and private investment group United Capital Partners. Essar said it has sold a 98% stake in the oil company at an enterprise valuation (EV) of $10.9 billion or Rs72,800 crore.
				   
				This works out to around 12.5 times Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization). Most analysts value Reliance Industries Ltds refining business at an EV/Ebitda multiple of around seven times at best. Prima facie, Essar has got itself a good deal.Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients, The formal announcement of the deal at the recent BRICS summit in the presence of the political leaders of India and Russia suggests a high degree of involvement of the Indian government in the transaction. We note that Indian PSU oil companies had earlier purchased a 49.9% stake in the Vankor oil block of Rosneft.Besides, according to a Bloomberg report, Essar was in talks with as many as five overseas oil companies for the asset sale. Its natural that Rosneft and the consortium ended up paying a premium when the competition was as high.That aside, the Essar asset offers decent growth opportunities. The company has had plans to double capacity at the existing plant, but couldnt do so because of financial constraints. The buyers should be able to follow through on these expansion plans and drive growth. Besides, Essar Oils refinery is in close proximity to the deep draft Vadinar port, which lends greater efficiency to the operations. The port has been acquired in a separate transaction at a valuation of $2 billion. Essar Oil also operates a network of 2,700 retail outlets. They may not have added much to overall profits until now, but their prospects have improved because of increased deregulation of prices of petroleum products.Rosneft can drive synergies by shipping relatively cheap crude oil from Venezuela and the Trafigura connect will help in selling oil products to Asia-Pacific markets.Essar Oil currently processes around 145 million barrels of crude oil annually. According to an oil industry analyst who did not want to be identified, its safe to assume that the company makes an Ebitda of around $6 per barrel, resulting in an annual Ebitda of $870 million. While this results in an expensive valuation of 12.5 times for the refining asset, this must be seen in light of other growth prospects, the added advantage of the port facility and the retail outlets, he adds. What about implications of the deal for Indian companies?The Essar Groups total debt in the system is estimated to be about Rs1.3 trillion, and this is expected to reduce substantially after the deal. While the group will use the proceeds to pay off debt, bank debt will also reduce, as part of Essar Oils debt is being refinanced by a Russian lender, according to news reports.ALSO SEE | Rosneft-Essar Oil deal cuts Essar Groups debt, lifts banksICICI Bank Ltd, one of the largest lenders to the Essar Group, has already seen a nearly $1.5 billion rise in market capitalization after the deal announcement.

				The Mahanagar Gas Ltd (MGL) stock has gone up about 80% from its issue price since listing. Not without reason.For one, the operating environment for these companies has improved. Stocks of city gas distributors such as IGL and MGL are being re-rated on account of better volume growth outlook and margin improvement. Analysts expect further improvement in profit margins of IGL and MGL on account of the recent gas price cut. But that should show in the December quarter results. For Petronet, higher liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand and bringing forward the completion of its Dahej expansion augur well.Secondly, all the above companies put up a remarkable show in the June quarter. MGL and IGL saw operating profit margins expand. GAILs petrochemical business swung to profit at the Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) level in the June quarter from a loss in fiscal year 2016. In fact, its petrochemical segment is expected to continue to report profit for this year, helped by higher volumes from its expanded petrochemical facility.Currently, GAIL, IGL, MGL and Petronet trade at 15.6 times, 19.5 times, 20 times and 23.5 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year, respectively. Valuations arent cheap. It is possible that the September quarter results may not turn out to be as robust as the June quarter. Still, its not that expectations are low for the September quarter.Strong LNG demand should help keep utilization levels at Petronets Dahej terminal high. Management had indicated partial commissioning of a vaporizer at Dahej at the end of 1Q. Further updates on start of the expanded facility and resolution of Kochi pipeline RoU (right of use) issues will be key to watch out for, wrote Arya Sen and Ranjeet Jaiswal of Jefferies India Pvt.

The brokerage firm has modelled total volumes of 4.4/4.6 mscmd in FY17/FY18. MGL is expected to report healthy volume too. GAILs petrochemical business is likely to continue the positive momentum. Investors would do well to follow the ramp-up on the Pata petrochemical expansion for the GAIL stock. From a medium-term perspective, if crude oil prices improve, then margins of the companys petrochemical and LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) business should expand.

				The primary issue afflicting the industrys growth is urea price control. The government makes good the production cost through subsidy, but unfortunately payments happen after long delays. Also under-allocation for subsidy requirement in earlier years means the budgeted amounts get exhausted in the first three quarters of the fiscal year.For instance, agricultural inputs manufacturer Coromandel International Ltd has received subsidy payment only till September. As of December, it has subsidy outstanding of Rs.1,582 crore, payment of which may happen only in the next fiscal year.The delay in payments is keeping the interest costs at elevated levels. Data compiled by rating agency Icra Ltd shows that interest expenses of 11 listed companies in the industry more than doubled in the last four years (between 2010-11 and 2014-15). During the period, key return ratios of these companies, such as return on capital employed and return on net worth, roughly halved.Pooling of natural gas and the recent softening of the spot market rates have helped alleviate working capital pressure. As a result, barring a few companies like Gujarat State Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd and Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers Ltd, interest costs at most companies did not rise significantly so far this fiscal year.But that provides no comfort. Prices of raw materials and fertilizers have fallen significantly in international markets, offering scope for subsidy cuts. Analysts expect the government to use this window to retain the overall subsidy amount at current levels and route the cost savings (on NPK grade or complex fertilizers) to clear pending subsidies. NPK is short for nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.This will not help the industry as it will widen the price gap between complex fertilizers and urea. The ideal step will be to rationalize urea prices, which will encourage balanced usage of fertilizers. But will the government bite the bullet? There is a pricing anomaly in the market with urea price being highly subsidized, leading to indiscriminate usage at the cost of NPK fertilizers, K. Ravichandran, senior vice-president and co-head-corporate sector ratings at Icra, said. While the government may resort to reduction in per unit subsidy on NPK nutrients in order to contain subsidy, farm gate price increase on urea remains to be seen with elections round the corner in five states, he added.",2016-02-23,CxQqNbBfv03REevFSeWnOO,"The primary issue afflicting the industrys growth is urea price control

In fact, JSW Energy is one of the few private firms to consistently generate double digit return ratios in recent years.That was made possible by its strong merchant business. Due to its Karnataka plants location advantage, JSW Energy was able to clinch good short-term deals. This helped it generate steady cash flows, giving it ammunition for asset acquisition. JSW turned FCF (free cash flow) positive in FY14 as it was able to spot stress in the sector early and pull out of organic growth at the right time. Thereafter, FCF has been growing despite pressure in the merchant market. This has helped JSW in making attractive acquisitions and allocating capital efficiently, Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd said in a note. Of course, merchant power tariffs are coming under pressure. But JSW Energy is managing to attain better tariffs by bidding for bilateral contracts. Also, to avoid offtake problems, the company is concentrating on buying operational assets with PPAs.A substantial part of the hydro power assets it acquired earlier are tied up through PPAs. The latest deal to acquire a 500MW power plant also has a PPA (besides being bought at discount to project cost). The 1,000MW deal with Jindal Steel and Power Ltd does not have a PPA yet. But the acquisition will be done at significant discount to replacement cost if a PPA is not signed in stipulated time.Nevertheless, the acquisitions will raise the share of PPAs in JSW Energys power business. With purchases being done at attractive prices and PPAs assured of steady returns, the management not only expects to fund current acquisitions without any balance sheet deterioration but also buy more in future.While the companys comfortable debt-to-equity ratio (less than two times now) may enable this, the challenge for JSW Energy is to optimize returns from the assets it is acquiring. The new assets do not have 100% PPAs and some like the latest acquisition are operating at sub-par levels due to low off-take. Also, they are in regions that have surplus power. It would be interesting to see how JSW Energy optimizes returns from them.",2016-07-21,DKsZ5gZPM3O1HT4cp78KgM,"With its latest 500 megawatt power plant purchase, JSW Energys capacities have almost doubled from three years ago
",00:59,How savvy deals propelled JSW Energy forward
0.34,"Deals in the infrastructure space are set to increase as companies put dozens of assets across roads and renewable energy sectors on sale, according to analysts and investment bankers. A number of such deals have either been announced or are in the due-diligence stage and will likely be completed in 2017. 
				   
				A number of infrastructure-focused funds and overseas pension funds have announced plans to invest in Indias roads and renewable energy projects.  Within infrastructure, roads is a sector where one will see deal activity improving, primarily because there are multiple operating assets available for a transaction that do not have construction risks involved and thus have better appeal to a financial investor. Also, there are multiple buying platforms emerging apart from the existing road platforms, as financial investors will also become acquirers of road assets via structures such as InvITs (infrastructure investment trusts). It is now a question of buyers and sellers expectations meeting at a certain valuation benchmark, said Navneet Singh, executive director and head, infrastructure group, Avendus Capital. ALSO READ: Indias solar prices set to drop amid competition, lower costsAlso, while deals in the thermal energy sector are expected to remain subdued due to the presence of only a handful of buyers, predominantly looking for operating assets, the renewable sector, primarily solar, will see activity in fund-raising as companies will continue to need additional capital to build their projects, Singh added. Several Indian infrastructure developers, weighed down by debt, have announced exits from individual highway projects to monetize assets and repay creditors while renewable energy firms evaluate fund-raises and going public.The infrastructure sector raised about $3.78 billion in 2016 across 36 transactions, including mergers and acquisitions (M&A), private equity (PE) investment and two initial public offerings (IPOs), analysis of monthly data from investment bank Equirus Capital Pvt. Ltd showed. This compares with $2.9 billion raised in 2014 and about $3.7 billion raised in 2015. According to data from Grant Thornton India, about $2.91 billion was raised from 39 M&A and PE transactions in 2016 across engineering, infrastructure, and clean-tech sectors.Funds such as US-based I Squared Capital, Indian asset manager IDFC Alternatives infrastructure fund, Canadas Brookfield Asset Management, Australias Macquarie Group, and the Canadian pension funds Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec (CDPQ) have committed large investments in the sector and are looking to buy assets across roads, thermal power and renewable energy to build their own portfolio in India. CDPQ, for example, had last year committed investments of $150 million for renewable energy in India and also joined hands with Tata Power Co. Ltd and ICICI Venture to launch a platform to facilitate investments in power projects with an initial capital of up to $850 million. Infrastructure Fund II of multi-asset manager IDFC Alternatives, for example, plans to buy certain operational road assets by March. A number of deals in the sector have been signed or announced over the last 12 months but many are yet to close. One noticeable trend seen is that closing and funding control acquisitions require significantly higher involvement and patience than buying simple passive minority stakes, said Aditya Aggarwal, partner (infrastructure) at IDFC Alternatives. Going forward, I would expect a lot more mid-sized M&A activity in renewables given that significant solar capacity would get commissioned from the equity lock-in restrictions in 2017. Likewise, I expect the TOT (toll-operate-transfer) model to be a game changer in road sector investments this year, Aggarwal said. The government is looking to monetize 75 national highways operated by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) through international competitive bidding under the so-called TOT model, where investors including foreign funds will participate. ALSO READ: Centre calls national review meet to push clean energy projectsSimilarly, road developers including Sadbhav Infrastructure Projects Ltd and Gayatri Projects Ltd are looking for buyers for some of their operational assets. Hyderabad-based Gayatri Projects is carrying out the process of demerging its roads assets into a separate entity to bring in a financial partner or look at selling the portfolio either entirely or as individual assets to foreign funds, managing director T.V. Sandeep Kumar Reddy said. He expects the demerger process to be over by end of March. Among upcoming deals this year is Larsen and Toubro Ltds (L&T) plan to transfer its build, operate, transfer (BOT) assets to Canadian pension fund CPPIB by March.

0.7,"Mumbai: The ongoing crisis in the $103 billion conglomerate is unlikely to impact Brand Tata, said Harish Bhat, chairman of Tata Global Beverages Ltd and brand custodian of the group. 
				   
				In an interview, he said that it was business as usual in all the operating companies even though the current spat had been tough to deal with at a personal level. Edited excerpts:As the custodian of the Tata brand are you concerned about brand erosion?First and foremost, the Tata brand is the result of many decades of initiatives which have to do with providing excellent products and service to our customers, which have to do with providing value back to the community, and which have to do with the highest level of corporate governance. So, this is a brand which has been built assiduously over several decades. Second is the consumers,  who buy our services and brands. Their trust in the Tata brand remains unchanged. Has the Tata brand been affected with respect to stakeholders?I would say this controversy perhaps has to some extent impacted the way some stakeholders look at the brand, and we will need to build on the brand and nurture it in the future, bearing that in mind.(Cyrus) Mistry has alleged some governance violations. As a representative of the chairman office of Tata Sons, how do you respond to that?Firstly, to have a chairman who is in open hostility with the promoter company puts at risk all the shareholders of the company. The company uses the brand name of the primary promoter company. There are credit ratings the company enjoys. People work in the company because it is part of a larger group. There are collaborations with joint venture partners which have been supported by Tata Sons.The other fact you mentioned is also very relevant. The board governance guidelines which was adopted by the board of Tata Global Beverages Ltd (TGBL) very clearly specified that if you were an employee of the company and if you were a non-executive director on the board of another Tata company and if you moved out of employment in your primary company, then you would also immediately resign from the boards of operating companies where you were a non-executive director. This was clause 2.9 of board governance guidelines which was adopted by the board of TGBL. It was adopted unanimously by the board, and the board at that time was chaired by Mistry.ALSO READ | What does Cyrus Mistry gain by trashing the Tata group?So, the question is now Mistry should also follow these guidelines which he has not done. I do believe that this is violation of the board governance guidelines. This is the second reason why we felt he should be replaced. This has been clearly mentioned in the appeal that Tata Sons has put out to all shareholders earlier this month.Isnt he still a director on the board of Tata Sons and hence an employee?A non-executive director is not an employee. He was an employee of Tata Sons until he was the chairman of Tata Sons.What about the allegations he has made about governance of the operating companiesTata Sons and Tata Trusts?I have been on the board of several operating companies of the group, and I must say that they are run independently by their own boards of directors. Our boards debate and discuss what the future strategy of the company should be, what the capital allocation should be. Those are decisions taken by the boards of the respective companies. As far as I am concerned, my experience on the boards of the companies is that the companies are independently run, are supervised by very competent boards composed of very competent and reputed independent and non-independent directors.What happens if in certain EGMs Mistry is not voted out?First and foremost I want to preface my answer to that to say that Tata Sons has issued an appeal to all our shareholders. Ratan Tata, our interim chairman has also written a letter to all our shareholders. In these letters and appeals, we have put forward our case very strongly on why the continued presence of Mistry on the boards of our operating companies can be disruptive and dysfunctional to those companies. The appeal from Tata Sons has also pointed out the corporate governance violation, which I discussed a little while ago. I am very confident that the shareholders will take those appeals and letters into account before deciding how they will vote in the best interests of the companies where they hold equity stake.ALSO READ | Tata Motors emerges as key battle in Tata vs Mistry fightFor any reason, if the situation arises, as you are describing it, then it is up to the board of Tata Sons to decide what they would like to do. What next now? How do you resolve this dispute?We have EGMs coming up next week. In those EGMs,  there are resolutions which Tata Sons has moved. Those resolutions will get voted upon. We are very keen to put the focus and spotlight very clearly on profitable growth of each operating firm within the company so that we can run as fast as required to create the right level of shareholder value. Is the group prepared for a long legal battle?The group will do whatever is right to safeguard our shareholders and safeguard all our stakes.Can you share with us whats top of your mind now?There are 2-3 things. First and foremost, I want to use this opportunity to pay tribute to all the operating companies of Tata group. Over the last few weeks, while this issue has been very actively discussed in media and in public forums, we must recognize and appreciate that for all our operating companies it has been business as usual. Also, at a personal level, the last few weeks have been very difficult for me, but not so difficult at a professional level. Let me explain why. At a personal level its difficult because any such situation for a person like me, who has been part of the Tata group for 30 years now, I think it creates anxiety. On the other hand, at a professional level, I have always borne in mind I should do what is right for the institution.ALSO READ | What if other Tata group shareholders vote the same way as those at TCS?Can you tell how you will restore the brand value which has been impacted to some extent?Two or three things. One is the principles on which the brand has been built remain unchanged. We do what is right by all our stakeholders, and they include our consumers, our financial shareholders, community, vendor partners and value chain partners and, of course, our employees.You were also a part of the group executive council under Cyrus Mistry. We understand that he was about to present a governance document which would define the relationship between Tata Sons, the trusts and the operating companies. Can you share something of that?I do not want to share in this interview any information about any documents that were being discussed in confidence. I hope you appreciate my point of view here. Having said that, yes, I was a member of the operating council under Mistry. There were specific roles that he had assigned to me in the GEC which were to do with customer-centric promoting, customer centricity and customer excellence in the group. They were to do with providing marketing support to some of the new businesses that we were incubating within Tata Sons.Were you a part of those discussions?Some discussions I was a part of, some I was not. There were discussions on many matters within the GEC. On the specific question you have asked on the governance document, I would not like to comment.Why is it that almost all the directors of Tata Global Beverages who have voted against Mistry have filed caveats against him in the Bombay high court?I do not want to comment on any legal matters. I believe the company will do whatever is right under the law.TGBL is the only listed company that has not called an EGM to remove Mistry as director?It is up to Tata Sons to decide if they want to call an EGM and in what order. Whenever Tata Sons calls the EGM, if they do and when they do, then we will have the EGM.Can you tell us what happened at the TGBL board meeting on 15 November? What was the need to move the circular resolution later? Is it an admission that it was not all kosher at the board meeting?No, absolutely not. The board meeting was conducted in strict adherence to the process of law. Whatever was the legal process required to introduce a resolution was followed to the T. Thats the first point I would like to make. I have already mentioned in an earlier interview that the reason I moved that resolution in the board meeting is because I believe, and eventually as you know seven out of 10 board members voted for that resolution, that Mr Mistrys continued presence as chairman of the board while he was also at the same time in an adversarial and hostile relationship with the primary promotor Tata Sons would be very harmful to the interests of the shareholders of TGBL.The circular resolution which was moved thereafter was without prejudice to the board meetings. It was just to re-emphasise the fact that a majority of directors were strongly in support of replacing Mistry as the chairman of the board for all the risks I pointed out earlier.What about the video recording. Why was it not made available to Mistry?Mistrys correspondence was with the company secretary of Tata Global Beverages and to the best of my knowledge the company secretary of Tata Global Beverages has responded to Mistry. I would also like to say that the law provides for the minutes of the meeting which have been recorded by the company secretary to be finalized within a period of time in case the video recording for some reason is not available. That legal process was also followed completely.In his representation to Tata Sons, Nusli Wadia said that in the case of Tata Steel, the founding fathers had given the company the name since 1907. Tata Steel existed much before Tata Sons and the brand agreement was signed only in 1998 so this needs to be examined and addressed. What are your views?I am very clear that the Tata trademark is owned by Tata Sons. The ownership of the trademark is with Tata Sons. Under a brand equity licence agreement, operating companies of the group use the trademark. So, those two facts are very clear to me and beyond that I dont want to add anything because trademark ownership is an established law in our country and indeed all parts of the world. We are also very clear that Tata Sons has added a lot of value to the Tata brand name.Do you think the independence of operating companies will be curtailed in the future?Each operating company of the Tata company is an independent organization. The board of directors of each individual company, whether it be of Titan (Co. Ltd) or Tata Global Beverages or Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), or any company of the group, the board of directors of that individual company is the one that guides the organization, which provides the strategic and governance framework for that company. We have a very competent board of directors with very competent independent and non-independent directors on each board. Having said that, each operating company of the Tata group does not exist in a vacuum. It exists as a part of the larger Tata group and I think it benefits greatly...like the use of the Tata trademark, credit rating and talent acquisition. So, you are saying that it will be status quo in the way that they are operating?I also want to say that, some of us who represent Tata Sons on the boards of these operating companies, what we do and what the entire board does is ensure that we try to maximize values for our entire shareholders into the future.Does profitable growth also entail exiting companies, which seems to be a bone of contention?(Ratan) Tatas letter to the shareholders has specified that very clearly. He has addressed the issue. He said very clearly that as a promoter, Tata Sons constantly evaluates new business opportunities and investments. Some of these investments have been successful while some others have taken time to be profitable. Our approach has been to support and fund these businesses during their development and growth phases. He has also mentioned that we will exit the business when we believe it is inviable.What are your views on where the group is headed with all these changes?See, my belief is that Tata Group is not just a corporation. It is an institution. It is an institution which is now 149 years of age. Its strongly embedded in some values which I think are dear to the institution. It symbolizes trust, it symbolizes the highest levels of corporate governance and it symbolizes doing good for the community or being a good corporate citizen. Those three fundamental pillars of the Tata brand will remain unchanged.R. Krishna Kumar, a trustee and director on the Tata Sons board, had in an earlier interview with the media shared that a succession plan for Tata Trusts is being discussed. This vindicates Cyrus Mistrys stand with respect to the governance structure of Tata Trusts, that it needs to be reworked.I do not want to comment on that. I am not part of the Tata Trusts. My relationship has been far more with Tata Sons and the operating companies. Thats a decision for Tata Sons to take. I do not wish to comment on the statement he has made.Given that you have worked Mistry for 3-3.5 years, did you see this coming?My working was with respect to all the functions he had allocated to me. And as far as Tata Sons is concerned, I do not have the visibility and would not like to comment on that. I have not been privy to those discussions and would not like to comment on that.How was it working with Mistry?I must mention this very clearly that I hold Mistry in very good personal regard. I have worked closely with him and the opportunity that he gave me to work as a member of the GEC and the specific role he gave me within the GEC. I have had several discussions with him. Those discussions were very cordial, very professional. I must say that I have not had the time so far over the last several weeks as you will no doubt realize to sit down and reflect on all those three years. But may be sometime in the future, I will do so.Was he a tough boss?How do you define tough. He was a boss who heard me out on areas I discussed with him and he would give me whatever decisions I wanted. If there was a specific area that he thought required far more intense work, he would tell me that.How is it that you and Mukund Rajan were retained and the other members of the GEC were let go?I can only talk about my performance appraisal. I also would not like to comment on other members of the GEC. I can only talk about the role I played. I did my role to the best of my capability. Whatever role was given to me, which I have already mentioned earlier. Now its up to Tata Sons and my boss at Tata Sons to judge how I performed.",2016-12-17,EReffw5Q2VhEVa25BzNgDN,Tata Global Beverages chairman Harish Bhat says its business as usual in all group firms though the Tata vs Mistry spat is tough to deal with at a personal level,02:38,Trust in the Tata brand remains unchanged: Harish Bhat
0.25,"Mint reported on 3 November that Tata Sons Ltd does not have a controlling stake in several Tata group companies including Tata Steel Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd. Cyrus Pallonji Mistry is the chairman of these companies and if he doesnt resignit is clear now that he wontthe holding company of the Tatas is going to have to fight a long and possibly bruising shareholder and legal battle to get him out. 
Mint reported on 4 November, citing a person close to the ousted chairman of Tata Sons, that he will indeed not resign as chairman of the Tata operating companies. Meanwhile, Tata Sons has disbanded the Group Executive Council. Three of its five members, all Mistrys hires, have left. The other two, Tata group veterans, have survived and been assigned larger roles. Mistrys email to the board of Tata Sons, a day after he was asked to go on 24 October, has raised several questions, just as Tata Sons explanation for asking Mistry to go has. Stories repeating these questions, or proffering answers to them, have started appearing in mainstream media, signs that the PR machinery on both sides has swung into action. Mint reported details of the PR and legal teams both sides have lined up on 1 November. Tata Sons cannot afford to have Mistry continue as chairman of the operating companies, although it is unlikely to push for his exit as a director. The second will require the support of a larger group of shareholders; the first will merely need to be approved by the board in a vote. Mistry, though, is likely to push for a vote by shareholders. In 2012-13, shortly after he took over as chairman of Tata Sons, the boards of these operating companies and their shareholders approved his nomination as their chairman too, but Mistry seems to think they may not toe the Tata Sons line this time. Given that his thinking on aviation and the Tata Nano is exactly that of several analysts, he may have good reason to believe that at least some shareholders approve of his actions and will support him.ALSO READ | Tata Group firms independent directors left in the dark on Cyrus Mistry ousterSo, what is likely to happen? Before we look at scenarios, let us try and understand the interests of the two sides. Tata Trusts, the dominant shareholder of Tata Sons, and Ratan Tata, chairman of Tata Trusts, want to re-establish control over the operating companies. They have already regained control of the holding company (indeed, they were never not in control), and also removed all of Mistrys men who had group-level positions. Mistry, a person close to him says, wants to protect the Tatas (as in the group) from Tata (as in Ratan Tata and Tata Trusts), and also safeguard his familys 18.38% holding in Tata Sons. I think he also wants to save face, for surely, this is not a fight he can expect to win. Now to the scenarios.The first involves a settlement between Mistry and Tata Sons, but given the bad blood on both sides, the chances of this are remote. It is also not clear what Tata Sons could give Mistry that would make him go quietly. Still, stranger things have happened. The second involves Mistry selling his stake. The person close to Mistry who has been mentioned above says this isnt on the table. Still, if Mistry does choose to exit, he could unload his stake in Tata Sons to an activist shareholder who could prove a thorn in the side of the company, a rival business group, or a passive investor aligned with the Tatas. The third involves a protracted battleat the level of the directors of the operating companies, at the level of shareholders of the operating companies, in the media, and in courts and regulatory bodies. Id hate to see the third happen because it will end up being bad not just for the Tata group, but Indian business itself in so many ways. That said, it does seem the most likely scenario. It is also one where Mistry has nothing to lose and the Tatas, a lot. Whoever wins, in the short-term, it is the Tata group that is the loser. Many of the Tata companies face significant challenges, but their leaders are likely to be distracted by the ongoing fight (apart from being confused about who to listen to). Mistrys email has already taken some of the sheen off the groups squeaky-clean image and the allegations and counter-allegations that have begun to fly will take some more off. He may have lost his job but ensuing eventsand it has been just two weeksmean the Tata group could lose its halo. R.

-0.07,"Mumbai: The root cause of the current conflict in the Tata group is groups operating structure itself, said proxy advisory firm Institutional Investors Advisory Services (IiAS) in a research note on Saturday. The Tata Trusts exert control over Tata Sons, which exerts control over operating companies, several of which  are listed and subject to scrutiny by external stakeholders including shareholders, it said. 
				   
				While shareholders expect them to operate along commercial lines, given that the companies belong to the Tata group, these are overlaid with additional expectations regarding behaviour and the brand. According to IiAs philanthropy running a commercial business creates its own paradoxes. The Trusts elegantly solved this problem by putting Tata Sons between themselves and the operating companies: The trusts could remain philanthropic even as Tata Sons pushed businesses to deliver higher profit. The Tata group needs to address possible areas of conflict and clearly set the terms of engagement between the three tiers of the group. They need to put in place an operating structure that outlives individuals, it said. To be sure, the nine page missive issued by Tata Sons on Thursday exposed the internal conflict among the different entities. The holding company accused the ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry of betraying the trust it had reposed in him and seeking to control the main operating companies of the Tata group to the exclusion of Tata Sons and other Tata representatives. The current scenario, says the proxy firm should be used as an opportunity to fix the structural issues in the Tata Group, a representatives. IiAs suggest that in order to align the interests of the Tata Trusts and Tata Sons, the chairperson of the Tata Trusts and Tata Sons must be the same individual as this has worked smoothly in the past. It also suggests Tata Trusts and Tata Sons in future should be run by independent CEOs with roles of each defined clearly. While the chairperson should be the custodian of the Tata brand, the role of the CEO of Tata Sons should be a bit more than that of a portfolio manager. The Tata Sons CEO should monitor the performance of companies, establish dividend policy and be responsible for capital allocation between companies. Additionally, the Tata Sons CEO should ensure adherence to the brand identity, and exploit group synergies by providing common services. The CEO should have the flexibility to rebalance portfolio companies, within reason given the Tata brand is associated with these. Like in corporate boards, the Tata Sons CEO will be answerable to the board and the chairperson. He should also ensure that that costs and the bureaucracy at Tata Sons does not balloon  a recent charge, it should be desirable to cap costs as a fixed percentage.Well-defined roles and an unambiguous chain of command should ensure that all participants are clear about their roles and responsibilities. The proposed structure is likely to be beneficial for all stakeholders  the stakeholders of listed companies as well as the Tata Trusts.The battle between Mistry and Ratan Tata has been intensifying with each passing day with neither side showing signs of relenting.

				Containers, which account for about half of Indias exim trade volumes, grew by a decent 5.2% in August. So far this fiscal year, they are up 4.3%, better than the 2.4% rise in the year-ago period, shows data compiled by ICICI Securities Ltd. According to Maersk Line, improving trade with mature marketsEurope and Americascan help container volumes maintain the positive growth momentum in the rest of the calendar year also. While the full-year growth may still be in single digits, anaemic global trade means Indias exim numbers are seen as a bright spot, especially by trade liners and logistics solutions providers. We can expect Indian trade to clock 8-9% growth for the full year 2016, which will be four times the growth of global trade, Maersk Line said in a statement.Non-ferrous metal prices may flatten out in second halfThe near-term outlook for non-ferrous metal prices indicates a flat trend in the second half of fiscal year 2017, after an uptrend in the first half, according to ratings agency Icra Ltd. Since global capacity utilization is 80%, if rising prices prompt higher output, prices could get affected. In the domestic market, apparent consumption in the first quarter was healthy, with a 25% increase in aluminium consumption over a year ago, 10% in copper and 13% in zinc, due to higher demand from power transmission and distribution, and the automobile sectors. Icra cautions high consumption levels may not continue, especially in aluminium, as they may be partly due to an inventory build-up. Its longer-term outlook for base metals remains positive.Petcoke prices continue their upward trendDomestic refiners have increased petroleum coke (petcoke) prices again this month, according to analysts.Prices are now 9.5% higher compared to the September quarter, according to HDFC Securities Ltd. This is detrimental for cement companies. Cement companies are expected to take a hit due to higher petcoke prices starting in the September quarter in some measure, especially those without a high forward cover, according to the brokerage firm. While cement companies have taken price hikes in some regions, it may only help set off the increase in operating costs. We remain negative on large caps on prohibitive valuations, said HDFC Securities.",2016-10-12,FATZmCqjmNhx49QTyQiFrI,"Containers, which account for about half of Indias exim trade volumes, grew by a decent 5.2% in August",00:17,Steady container volumes add heft to Indias trade

				The firm benefited from higher coal prices, dividend income and low finance costs. Barring two units, all key subsidiaries generated operating profits and  several reported better operating profits.The coal business was the star performer. As prices rose, the firm sold 14% more coal. True, high prices have hurt its ultra-mega power plant at Mundra, Gujarat. Under-recoveries rose and losses at the plant continued. But that did not come as a surprise as the plant was anyway stuck in unfavourable offtake agreements. What stood out is better operating performance. Availability of the plant roseits up from 77% a year ago to 85% in the last quarter. This improved fixed cost recovery.Revenues at the stand-alone company level fell due to low power demand and offtake. But that did not percolate to earningsprofit was up 26% at the stand-alone levelthanks to high dividend from shipping and investment subsidiaries.Overall the performance was satisfactory. Tata Power revised downwards the previously agreed sale consideration for its Indonesian asset PT Arutmin. But the change in consideration is due to adjustments related to prior period liabilities, past claims and statutory obligation and not due to valuation write-down, the company clarified, says an analyst who attended the conference call.ALSO READ | Tata Power cuts sale consideration for Arutmin mine in Indonesia to $246 mnThe recent rebound in coal rates is likely to benefit Tata Power in the current quarter also. Of course, firm coal prices will undermine the Mundra power plants profitability. But as analysts point out, at the company level Tata Power is net long on coal, in terms of its share in coal generation and usage at the Mundra plant.

0.62,"Shares of Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) have performed well in recent months. One reason for the optimism is increasing crude oil prices. Brent crude prices have averaged higher so far for the current quarter compared to the September quarter. 
				   
				The state-run upstream oil company has announced a decent set of numbers for the quarter ended 30 September. Its operating profit or Ebitda came in at Rs9,539 crore. Analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd and Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd were expecting the measure at about Rs8,930 crore. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. One reason that helped ONGC beat estimates is a decline in operating costs. Statutory levies and other expenses declined 13% and 8%, respectively, on a year-on-year basis. Not only that, exploration costs written off fell sharply as well. Finance costs dropped 7.5%. The upshot: ONGCs pre-tax earnings increased 4% at a time when revenue declined 10% and other income was a bit lower.While the companys September quarter crude oil production is lower compared to last years quarter, crude oil and gas production both have improved compared to the June quarter. Net realization for the September quarter stood at $47.92 per barrel, an improvement on a sequential basis, which was pretty much expected. If the recent strength in oil prices were to persist, then upstream oil companies including ONGC will benefit this quarter. However, at the same time, some of the gains from higher oil prices are likely to be set off by the 18% lower domestic gas price effective 1 October.But investors have no reason to complain. The ONGC share price has increased by as much as 43% from its lows seen in mid-May. The board has recommended a bonus issue in the ratio of 1:2.

Stand-alone pre-tax and one-time earnings declined by a fourth from a year earlier to Rs.3,173 crore. The petrochemicals business has been a major source of pain what with the segment posting earnings before interest and taxes (Ebit) loss of Rs.807 crore in FY16. Performance was impacted on account of lower sales volume and weaker prices.However, the business is expected to swing to profit this year. The re-negotiation of RasGas long-term LNG (liquefied natural gas) contract at lower prices is expected to reduce raw material costs, helping petrochemicals performance. GAIL has commissioned its petrochemical plant expansion in Pata (Uttar Pradesh) with capacity of 0.4 million tonnes per annum or MMPTA (taking total capacity to 0.81 MMPTA). Accordingly, the segment should also benefit from a gradual ramp up in volume.

-0.4,"Those who have known Ratan Tata well over the years vouch for his sense of fair play, his innate courtesy and his infectious smile. What they also tell you is that he conceals an iron fist in a velvet glove. When it comes to business or matters related to his business interests, this is a man who believes not in win-win but win-loseI win and you lose. He may be 78 years old and for the last four years he seems to have been content playing the benevolent angel to a clutch of technology start-ups. But if you thought he had taken his eyes off the ball, the tough words in his signed statement as the new interim chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, following the abrupt and shocking replacement of Cyrus Mistry, should put such thoughts to rest. I have agreed to do so in the interest of stability and reassurance to the Tata group. Thats not a man looking to appease anyone, not even someone he helped appoint as his successor less than four years ago.
				   
				Not surprisingly, Mistry, a proven success in his own businesses and on the board of Tata Sons since 2006, differed and departed from what Ratan Tata had set in play over the two decades that he led the group. The disconnect though, seemed normal and related to business strategy. Tata Steels global operations were the personal handiwork of Ratan Tata, something he had staked his groups future on in 2007 when he paid $12 billion to buy UK steel maker Corus Group Plc. The move catapulted Tata into the list of the worlds top steel makers but also laid the seeds for the massive losses that Mistry inherited when he took over as chairman, coincidentally around the time that the commodities cycle was turning adverse. Mistrys calculated decision to exit the business may have seemed rational to him but for the ex-chairman it must have been a bitter pill to swallow.The roles seemed reversed when it came to aviation, which was clearly a passion for Tata. Mistry may or may not have been too excited about the venture into this already crowded area but certainly the splitting of the investments into Air Asia India and Vistara seemed at odds with his style of working.Yet, these were business decisions and in a group as professional as the Tatas, must have had the collective assent of the board members, which included Ratan Tata. Nor is the latter a stranger to a new chairman stamping his authority in a new position. One of his first moves on taking over as group chairman in 1991 was to tighten his control over the various group companies. Thus, powerful satraps like Russi Mody at Tata Steel Ltd and Darbari Seth at Tata Chemicals Ltd, who under his predecessor J.R.D. Tata had pretty much the run of the place, were reined in and then eased out. This was followed by a massive restructuring exercise to create a more streamlined and capital-efficient group.ALSO READ | Cyrus Mistry ousted as Tata Sons chairman, Ratan Tata steps inSo were there other reasons for this abrupt decision? A clash of wills at this level seems churlish. That Mistry wasnt even given the option of resigning points to unprecedented and unusual circumstances and holds out the promise of more developments. In its 148-year history, the group has experimented with different chairmen for Tata Sons and Tata Trusts only once beforewhen J.R.D. Tata headed the trusts and Ratan Tata headed Tata Sons. But that was for a only short time before JRDs death and, in any case, involved two Tatas. The failure of the move to appoint an outsider to head Tata Sons while Ratan Tata retained his hold over the trusts could also mean that the next chairman may well be from the larger Tata family.

Ltd (ONGC), said a person aware of the development. 
				   
				The move is set to secure more time for RIL to resolve the dispute and help it avoid any immediate financial impact. The ministry raised the demand on 4 November, giving RIL one month to pay up, after the justice A.P. Shah panel told the ministry on 31 August that RIL should make up for the unfair enrichment it had obtained by way of retaining the gains of gas that seeped into its field from that of ONGC. The one-member panel, which looked into ONGCs complaints of gas flow between the two companies blocks, had also said that it is the government, not the state-run firm, which is eligible for compensation from RIL.The Mukesh Ambani-promoted firm has questioned the way the government interpreted the production lease for its KG-DWN-98/3 (KG D6) block and alleged that the manner of claiming compensation neither conformed to law nor to global practices, the person cited earlier said, on condition of anonymity. RIL, as the operator of the KG D6 block, has sought arbitration on behalf of the consortium comprising Canadas Niko Resources Ltd and BP Exploration (Alpha) Ltd, the person said. Emails sent to the three companies remained unanswered at the time of going to press. A government official privy to the developments, however, said there was no way of resolving the dispute other than RIL paying for the gas that did not belong to its field. With both sides hardening their positions, the dispute is set to slip into a protracted legal battle. According to a report by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, a US-based consultancy selected by both ONGC and RIL which was relied upon by the Shah panel for confirmation of the gas flow between the blocks, about 11 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas migrated to KG D6 from adjacent fields between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2015,  of which 8.9 bcm was tapped by RIL. The government official cited above said the ministry has not applied any discretion in arriving at the compensation figure.The government merely multiplied the amount of gas found by independent consultants to have flowed between the fields with the applicable gas price, the official said. Prolonged disputes are not in the interest of the industrys development.

As it executes more projects, Amplus could also do with more equity infusion from I Squared, Aggarwal said. Amplus is the countrys second-largest rooftop solar projects developer.The World Bank had in June said it would invest $625 million in Indias rooftop solar sector, while the ADB said this month that it plans to provide $500 million in financing to the sector.Executives of both the financial institutions said they were preparing to begin these investments. The World Bank project is being implemented by the State Bank of India, which will lend funds to developers of commercial and industrial rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems.

Tata Sons controls 26.51% of Tata Motors, 19.35% of Tata Chemicals and 29.75% of Tata Steel. The development followed Tata Chemicals board meeting on Thursday at which Wadia and other independent directors backed Mistry as chairman of the board. The directors said they took into consideration his performance for the past couple of years in backing him.It is an unprecedented move by the Tatas, said Amit Tandon, managing director and founder at Institutional Investor Advisory Services, a proxy advisory firm, alluding to the attempt to eject Wadia. Usually, companies do not remove the independent directors unless there are compelling reasons to do so, he added.

On Thursday, Tata Sons removed Mistry as chairman of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, in which it has a majority stake.In the days following Mistrys ouster from Tata Sons, the two sides have traded bitter accusations. On Thursday, the holding company accused Mistry of betraying the trust it reposed in him when it appointed him chairman in 2012. The Mistry camp said he was fired for going after holy cows in the Tata group.In a separate development, Bhaskar Bhat, a non-executive, non-independent director on the board of Tata Chemicals , resigned. In a letter to Mistry, Bhat said the content in the statement by independent directors dilutes his views expressed in the board meeting.The contents as well as the spirit of the statement completely dilutes the views I expressed at the Board meeting today especially regarding the threat the company faces on account of loss of confidence of the promoter Tata Sons in the chairman of Tata Chemicals Limited. Several important issues of discomfort I expressed seem to have been totally ignored. I therefore hereby tender my resignation as director of Tata Chemicals, with immediate effect, Bhat said in his letter. Wadia, chairman of Bombay Dyeing & Manufacturing Co.

0.53,"Mumbai: Cyrus Mistry, the ousted chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, on Sunday rebutted the 10 November statement of the Tata group holding company that alleged Mistry was seeking to control the main group operating firms to the exclusion of Tata Sons and other Tata representatives.
				   
				Tata Sons statement alludes to Mistry having created a new structure where operating companies were drifting away. This is furthest from the truth, said the statement from Mistrys office, while explaining the changes were made to reflect the contextual difference within which the group currently functions.The corporate governance framework in India has considerably tightened in recent times with more stringent rules on the independence of directors, female directors, board evaluation, and so on. To meet this increased scrutiny, several new policies and frameworks were developed at the group centre and deployed across operating companies, said the statement.As such, prior to Mistrys chairmanship, all board members of Tata Sons, with the exception of him, were internal to the group, being either vice-chairmen of group firms or members of the group corporate centre (GCC), said the statement, while pointing out that the structure is exactly the opposite today.According to the statement, the requirement to have 30% Trust nominees and 30% independent directors meant that in addition to Ishaat Hussain and Mistry, there was possibly only one more senior GCC member who could be on board of Tata Sons. This limited the involvement of other group centre members on Tata Sons board, said the note, adding that in the past three years, all these internal members, with the exception of Hussain, had retired. This was a generational change.As agreed with the Tata Sons board, the governance mechanism to protect Tata Sons interests and ensure adequate group representation on operating company boards was to have group executive council (GEC) members, other senior group centre members such as Farokh Subedar and S. Padmanabhan, and select chief executive officers such as Bhaskar Bhat and Noel Tata on the boards of operating firms.In addition, of the nine independent directors on boards of operating firms like Tata Chemicals Ltd and Indian Hotels Co. Ltd which have shown support for the ousted chairman, six were appointed during Ratan Tatas tenure. Moreover, two of these directors also serve as trustees on Tata Trusts.To question the independence of the directors by Tata Sons is truly unfortunate, given that the country acknowledges them as stalwarts of India Inc. To suggest ulterior objectives and clever strategy can sway these eminent names in undertaking their fiduciary duties and in discharging the duties mandated by statute as independent directors is absolutely astonishing and really speaks to how low Tata Sons has unfortunately stooped in their public statements, said the statement.",2016-11-13,ISo8Qt9SvuSunbtiVmJD1H,Cyrus Mistrys office says a new structure was created with an eye on better transparency,18:20,Cyrus Mistry rebuts Tatas takeover bid claim

Ltd (ONGC). 
				   
				Calgary-based Niko Resources Ltd, which holds 10% interest in RIL-operated KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block, said the partners believe they are not liable for the amount claimed by the government of India. In an emailed statement, it said it is considering joining RIL in invoking the dispute resolution mechanism in the production sharing contract (PSC). The oil ministry had on 3 November issued a notice to RIL, Niko and UKs BP plc seeking $1.47 billion for producing in the seven years ended 31 March 2016 about 338.332 million British thermal units of gas that had seeped or migrated from state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp.s (ONGC) blocks into adjoining KG-D6 in Bay of Bengal. After deducting $71.71 million royalty paid on the gas produced and adding an interest at the rate of Libor plus 2%, totalling $149.86 million, a total demand of $1.55 billion was made on RIL, BP and Niko. RIL had on Friday stated that it proposes to invoke the dispute resolution mechanism in the PSC and issue a notice of arbitration to the government. RIL remains convinced of being able to fully justify and vindicate its position that the governments claim is not sustainable, the company had said, adding it has worked within the boundaries of the KG-D6 block awarded to it and has complied with all applicable regulations and provisions of the PSC. The claim of the government is based on misreading and misinterpretation of key elements of the PSC and is without precedent in the oil and gas industry, anywhere in the world, it had said. BP, which holds the remaining 30% interest, said it is evaluating its options. BP believes that the action taken is neither in line with well-established global practices nor is it in line with the PSC. We are aligned and working with our partners to evaluate our options to achieve an effective resolution, a BP India spokesperson said. Originally, ONGC had sued RIL for producing gas that had migrated from its blocks KG-DWN-98/2 (KG-D5) and Godavari PML in the KG basin to adjoining KG-D6 block of RIL.

0.36,"Mumbai: Proxy advisory firm InGovern Research Services Pvt. Ltd has recommended the minority shareholders of Tata group companieswhich are holding their EGMs between 13 December and 26 December for the removal of Cyrus P. Mistry as director from the board of the operating companiesto vote against the resolution as Tata Sons Ltd hasnt provided any compelling reasons. 
				   
				Six of the seven Tata-listed group companies where Mistry serves as a director have called for EGMs to replace Mistry as a director after having received requisition from the promoter shareholder Tata Sons. Tata Sons hasnt provided any compelling reasons for the removal of Mistry as a Director from the Boards of the operating companies, said the proxy advisory firm in an email on Thursday morning, while drawing out a case for each of the individual companies and why it recommends minority shareholders to vote against the resolution.Moreover, Tata Sons hasnt articulated any new plans or visions for the operating companies than what the Boards under Mistry had adopted, said InGovern. Also, it is important to note that Mistry continues to have a beneficial shareholding of 3-13% in the listed companies, through 18.4% minority shareholding in Tata Sons Ltd. His presence as a Director on the Boards of the listed companies should be a balance on the Boards and a representation of the minority shareholder. In many operating companies, Cyrus Mistry continues to have the confidence of the Independent Directors, said the advisory. Also read: Ratan Tata asks shareholders to back Mistrys removal from group firmsInGovern also urged shareholders to question inherent assumptions regarding the value of the group structure and the value of Tata brand and demand greater disclosures on information flow between Tata Sons and the operating companies.Minority shareholders should decide on their votes independent of the actions of the promoter shareholder, said the InGovern advisory note, which was the second proxy firm to come out in support of Mistry after Institutional Shareholders Services Inc. (ISS), a foreign proxy advisory firm. So far four advisory firms have issued recommendations which are now equally split for and against.Making a case for the individual companies, InGovern said that in the case of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, which is holding its EGM on 13 December, The promoter itself accepts that the performance of TCS has been good, we do not see any logic as to why a shareholder should vote for removal of a director who was the chairman, for performance issues.The advisory firm further questioned the logic as to why the board had recommended the removal of a director who was given a favourable rating as a chairman a few months back and conceded that the plausible reason is that he was a nominee of Tata Sons on the board of TCS and since he was replaced as chairman for Tata Sons, it is natural that he be removed from the board of TCS. Also read: Cyrus Mistrys office says he is fighting to protect Tata groupAccording to InGovern, Shapoorji Pallonji Group, which is represented by Mistry, has the second largest share in the company after the promoters at 13.47% which means he has skin in the game and hence his interests would be in the best interests of the company. InGovern also discarded the possibility that his presence would cause constant conflict and said that it feels that a board is more effective when everyone is not Yes-men of the promoters on the board. While the Articles of Association of TCS allows the promoter to appoint and replace a chairman without the need to seek prior opinion of the board, we believe such a provision greatly restricts how he powers of the board, said InGovern, which recommended shareholders to raise concerns to remove such provisions from the board. In the case of the Indian Hotels Co. Ltd, which has its EGM on 20 December, all the independent directors have shown support for Mistry and the proxy advisory firm has recommended shareholders to vote against the removal of Mistry from the board as there is no compelling logic, it said. For Tata Steel Ltd, which had its EGM on 21 December, the proxy advisory firm was against the removal of both Mistry and Nusli Wadia as a director. Wadia who had been on the board for 47 years has had a tenure which is far greater than the maximum 10 years for Independent directors, as per Companies Act, 2013. However, Tata Sons proposes his removal not due to his long tenure but because he acted in concert with Mistry. Promoters who remove independent directors who do not agree with their views also sets a bad precedent for Indian corporate governance and such efforts should be thwarted by voting against the promoter proposals, said InGovern. Also read: Cyrus Mistry-Ratan Tata spat: A look at how the events unfoldedIf it is because of the long tenure, then there are at least 10 independent directors across the several group companies, including Aman Mehta of TCS, Deepak Parekh at Indian Hotels, Nasser Munji at Tata Chemicals and Homiar Vaccha at Tata Power Ltd. The proxy advisory firm listed similar reasons to support its recommendations for voting against the removal of Mistry and Wadia in the case of Tata Motors Ltd and Tata Chemicals. It was also against the removal of Mistry from the board of Tata Power, which is holding its EGM on 26 December. The independent directors of Tata Power have not made their positions publicly known even as the other six companies have aired their views. InGovern and ISSs recommendations are in contrast to that of Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS), a Mumbai-based proxy advisory firm. On 30 November, IiAS advised shareholders to vote in favour of Mistrys removal as his continuation on the board may lead to unnecessary friction between the operating companies and Tata Sons. SES, another proxy advisory firm, also recommended voting in favour of Mistrys removal. SES in its analysis has found that the performance of the Company has been agnostic to different persons occupying the post of the Chairman. TCS appears to be a company having matured well settled processes and system and a competent work force and management team. Therefore, removal of Mr. Mistry as a director is not likely to impact performance of the Company. However, as observed in other Tata companies, there is a high probability that continuation of Mr. Mistry might lead to Divided Board which is a value destroyer for sure, the firm said in a 5 December note.",2016-12-08,IjX79ZEzsxCVUmWgQTMDgK,InGovern says Tata Sons hasnt provided any compelling reasons for the removal of Cyrus Mistry as a director from the boards of the operating companies,11:19,InGovern tells shareholders to vote against Tata resolution to remove Mistry

-0.05,"Mumbai: Gamesa Renewable Pvt. Ltd, the local unit of Spanish wind turbine maker Gamesa Corp Tecnologica SA, expects to maintain its top position in the Indian market as it installs wind energy capacity at its fastest pace, chairman and managing director Ramesh Kymal said
				   
				Gamesa Renewable, which became Indias largest wind turbine maker three years ago by wresting market share from rival Suzlon Energy Ltd, plans to install 1,600 megawatt (MW) of wind capacity for various independent power producers (IPPs) this year, Kymal said in a phone interview on 2 November.The company, a late entrant in the countrys wind-turbine market, has already installed wind capacity of about 3500MW or 3.5 gigawatt (GW) for its customers in India till date. In comparison, Suzlon has installed more than 9.5GW of wind capacity, but it was built over a longer period of time. It took us four years to install the first 1,000 MW, and another 17 months for the next 1,000MW. Then we installed the next 1,000MW in nine months and now we will do the next 1,000MW in just four months. Thats the kind of growth we are seeing because we are focused on the IPP sector. Ninety-eight percent of our sales come from the IPPs, he said. Inox Wind Ltd  and Gamesa have a significantly higher share of sales in IPPs compared with Suzlon Energy, which has a bigger share of investor clients, who look for tax benefits from accelerated depreciation. But that is changing as Suzlon also is trying to increase its share of IPP clients. Gamesa had a 29% market share in fiscal 2016 while Suzlon Energy and Inox had a market share of 26% and 23%, respectively. Suzlon wants to reclaim the  50% share it once had, founder Tulsi Tanti said in an interview earlier this year.  (bit.ly/20SM4W1)We have gained market share from the earlier market leaders... We are likely to be the number one this year too. We would like to maintain our market share at 30-35% and we do not have the overarching ambition to achieve 40% or 50%, Kymal said.Cumulatively, the order book of Gamesa, Inox and Suzlon  touched about 3.4GW as of 31 March, IDFC Securities Ltd analysts Shirish Rane and Mohit Kumar wrote in a 25 October note. We expect the Indian wind turbine market size to touch 4.3-4.5GW (per annum) in FY17E on the back of healthy order book of Suzlon, Inox and Gamesa India, they wrote. Gamesa counts ReNew Power Ventures Pvt. Ltd, Hero Future Energies, Orange Renewables, Tata Power Co. Ltd, Ostro Energy Pvt. Ltd, and Greenko Energy Holdings among its customers. Parent Gamesa had in November 2014 committed 100 million in investment for expansion of facilities in India. The Indian unit changed its name to Gamesa Renewable from Gamesa Wind Turbine Pvt. Ltd after entering the solar energy market. It plans to build about 160MW-200MW of solar energy capacity on the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) model.Kymal said the Indian unit is now locally manufacturing inverters used in solar projects from earlier importing them from Spain. This is helping it earn higher margins in building these projects even as low solar tariffs mean margins for EPC companies have been squeezed. Suzlon, which last year won 210MW of solar projects, too is focusing on the solar EPC market. In June, Gamesa announced it plans to merge its wind business with those of German engineering company Siemens AG. The merger, which is expected to close by March 2017, will not see any changes in the India business, given Siemens is not present in wind in India, Kymal said.Apart from Suzlon, Inox Wind and Gamesa, wind equipment makers in the country include WinWinD and ReGen Powertech Pvt. Ltd. Large wind IPPs include Welspun Renewables Ltd (now under Tata Power), Goldman Sachs-backed ReNew Power, Morgan Stanley-owned Continuum Wind Energy Ltd, and JP Morgan-backed Leap Green Energy Pvt.

-0.58,"New Delhi/Mumbai: Screams alerted Dadasaheb Vidhate to the fire trapping three of his children in the familys thatched-roof hut in rural India.
				   
				Neighbours rushed to help douse the fire, but we couldnt save anyone, Vidhate, 45, said of the blaze four years ago, which he blames on an overturned kerosene lamp. My children were burned alive before my eyes.With no electricity, the one-room mud shelter on a farm 240 kilometers (150 miles) east of Mumbai had only the lamp for lightcommon in India, where power remains unaffordable, inadequate or simply non-existent for 240 million people. If their hut had been connected to the power grid, Vidhate believes it may never have caught fire, killing Aakash, 15, Manisha, 13, and 11-year-old Vikas, he said.When Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged to bring reliable power to all citizens during the campaign that propelled him into office in 2014, the same year the World Bank pegged India as home to the worlds largest un-electrified population. While his government has made progress meeting its 2019 deadline, many families are still missing out, holding back some of Indias poorest, most-vulnerable citizens and preventing the country from achieving its development ambitions.In the year after Modis election, an audit identified 18,452 villages without electricity. Since then, that number has fallen by a third, leaving only 1% of the countrys total villages to be electrified, the data show. But a closer look at what constitutes electrified reveals how much further India has to go.Also Read: Modis budget holds key to burnish outlook for India stock flowsAbout 250 kilometers east of New Delhi in the village of Fateh Nagla in Uttar Pradesh, Indias most-populated state and one of its poorest, the dairy shop runs on a combination of solar power and a led battery, while its three flour mills use diesel generators. In the afternoons, men wait their turn to charge their mobile phones off a wire rigged up to an electric water pump, according to village head Susheel Kumar.Though only 15 of its roughly 170 homes are connected to the power grid, the government lists Fateh Nagla as electrified, Kumar said. Thats because the village barely meets the central governments definition: the basic infrastructure is in place; power is being supplied to schools, health centers and other public places; and at least 10% of households are receiving electricity.In winter, when the sun sets at around 5:30pm, only a few solar-powered lights or kerosene lamps break the darkness. And even homes with a power connection are bereft of light as it switches on only after 10 pm and back off early in the morning, according to Kumar. That makes it difficult for children to do their homework, stunting education in a village where about 90% drop out of school by eighth grade, he said.Throughout Uttar Pradesh and neighbouring Biharwith combined populations approaching the size of the USfewer than half of rural households have power connections, according to data from the central government. But, by its definition of electrified, the same data as of Monday showed only 13 villages in Uttar Pradesh and 598 in Bihar lacked power.The governments definition of an electrified village doesnt make sense, said Aruna Kumarakandath, who leads renewable energy research at New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment, a non-profit public advocacy organization. How can we say a village is electrified if 90% of homes dont get power?The power ministrys top bureaucrat, Pradeep Kumar Pujari, sees building infrastructure to power villages as just the first step toward full electrification.By creating the infrastructure, we are creating demand from rural households, Pujari, the secretary of the ministry, said this week. There are challenges involved in this and this will not happen overnight. But it will happen slowly.Modis political fortunes ride on reaching his power for all goal, said Sandeep Shastri, a political scientist and pro-vice chancellor at Jain University in Bengaluru.It addresses the under-privileged sections of society and defies accusations that his government works only for the rich, Shastri said. The success of the program can have a big, positive impact on Modis political fortunes, while a failure can boomerang badly and bolster allegations that this governments promises are more of rhetoric and less of action.Power shortages cost India the equivalent of about 7% of gross domestic product, the World Bank said in 2010, when the country witnessed supply deficits of almost 15%. The government said the gap narrowed to less than 1% as of November, although that deficit only measures supplies to customers already connected to the grid.The power problems in India, which in 2012 suffered one of the worst blackouts in history and still has some 50 million rural households without electricity, are hardly about building more power plants or access to fuel. The country uses only half its generation capacity and its state-run coal miner is the worlds largest.Power plants, as well as installing polls and wires for distribution, is only a small part of the challenge ensuring reliable supply to poor households, said Ashwini Chitnis, a senior research associate at Prayas, a non-profit advocacy group that focuses on energy, health and education. While efforts toward putting in place infrastructure for electrification are absolutely necessary, they are not sufficient, Chitnis said.Some state-run power retailers consider supplying rural homes as an unattractive business proposition because of thin usage and below-cost tariffs, according to Dinesh Arora, chief executive officer at REC Power Distribution Co., a unit of state-run Rural Electrification Corp., which oversees the village electrification efforts.Power distributed to farmers and households under the poverty line is sold at below-market rates, the subsidies for which state governments are slow to repay.In addition, electricity retailers lose about one-quarter of the electricity they have for sale through technical and commercial lossesthe industry term for power theft. A federal government-led program aims to lower that to an average of 15% by 2019 with technology that tracks theft and improves metering, billing and revenue collection.The root cause of the poor financial health of the distribution companies is organized theft of power, said Padamjit Singh, a board member of Transparency International India and a member of the All India Power Engineers Federation, who believes the companies distributing electricity are sometimes complicit in the theft. Unless that is fixed, I see no hope for the people who dont have electricity.Even when the distribution company is willing to connect a house, some owners will balk at the upfront fees of 2,000 rupees to 3,000 rupees ($29 to $44), he said. Many households dont have that kind of money, said Deepak Gupta, senior program manager at New Delhi-based Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation. Many households dont have that kind of money.Indias expanding economy and population put it on the track to be the biggest driver of global energy demand through 2040, the Paris-based International Energy Agency said in a report on the country in 2015. Its grid connections are growing by 5% a year, a development that, along with rising incomes, means its power system needs to quadruple in size by 2040 just to keep pace. The IEA noted a spiral of poor performance by state distributors and described their financial dilemma as a key structural weakness for the energy sector.The distribution companies have no incentive to supply power to rural areas because they dont get paid, Gupta said. People dont pay because they have no incentive to pay, because they dont get quality power. It keeps on going like that.Earlier this month on the outskirts of Shirdi, a village in the western state of Maharashtras poorest districts, Vidhate showed a visitor the spot where he lost his children in the fire and explained how he and his wife, Anita, survived because they had been sleeping outside to guard their cow and goats. This can happen to any home that burns kerosene lamps, he said.

-1.0,"Domestic gas prices have been cut again. This is the fourth consecutive cut since November 2014 (see chart). For October-March 2017, prices have declined 18% to $2.5 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) on gross calorific value basis. What is worse is that analysts expect another round of price cut in April 2017 when the next price change is due. So far, trends in regional benchmarks that determine domestic prices indicate another cut is likely.
				   
				So who wins, who loses when domestic gas prices are cut?Earnings of gas producers such as Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) will be adversely impacted. This comes at a time when ONGC and OILs crude oil price realizations are already under pressure due to the lower crude oil price environment. According to Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd, for ONGC, the impact on revenue will be nearly Rs2,500 crore, with a post-tax impact of Rs2 a share (6.5% of its FY18 EPS of Rs31). For OIL, the impact on revenue would be nearly Rs350 crore, and a post-tax impact of Rs4 per share (7.5% of Nomuras FY18 EPS of Rs52). EPS is earnings per share. Very low production from KG-D6 (D6 field in the Krishna-Godavari  basin) means that the impact on Reliance Industries Ltd will be marginal.On the other hand, GAIL (India) Ltd is expected to benefit from low gas prices. The company uses domestic gas for its LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) production. Margins for the LPG business should expand by ~10% with this price reduction, said analysts from Religare Capital Markets in a report on 3 October. After a 20% domestic gas price cut on 1 April, GAILs operating costs fell sharply, 25% quarter-on-quarter in the June quarter for both LPG and gas transmission segments, said Nomura in a report on 30 September. Needless to say, another decline in prices will benefit GAIL further.City gas distributorsIndraprastha Gas Ltd, Mahanagar Gas Ltd and Gujarat Gas Ltdare expected to benefit too. The quantum of benefit, though, will depend on the extent of gain they decide to pass on to consumers in the form of retail price cuts.Meanwhile, the government has also reduced the ceiling price for gas produced from new difficult fields by 20% to $5.3 per mmBtu.

				The trigger is perhaps the strong indication of a better year for retail air conditioner sales.This segment accounts for half the revenue clocked in its domestic operations. Dealers say sales in January were better than what it was last year, and discounts were lower, too.A recent report by Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd says that in a recent exhibition on heating, ventilating and air conditioning, manufacturers were showcasing new products or energy-efficient variants, optimistic of good sales in the coming summer.Last years inventory pile-up, due to a less severe summer, had been drawn down during the October-November festive season.Meanwhile, the sales of larger commercial air conditioners used by hotels, retail stores, educational institutions and offices are hotting up, too. Together, the segment, which is called the unitary cooling products (UCP) division, has shown decent growth. Voltass market share rose by about 300 basis points  over the last two years. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Unfortunately, the companys engineering and electro-mechanical projects (EMP) businesses have been the spoilers for some quarters in the recent past. Voltas significant presence in the international markets, especially in the Gulf, marred performance due to delays in project execution and payments. The EMP segment even posted a loss in the December quarter, faring worse than the Streets expectation. Add to this weak order inflows: a situation that is unlikely to change in the near term with the low oil price raising concerns regarding capex in these regions.On home ground, too, it may be a while before large industrial and infrastructure orders pick up. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) for January declined more than anticipated, led by weakness in manufacturing. Like most companies in the capital goods pack, Voltas, too, will see gains in the last leg of the capex cycle, as that is when its products are installed.But, on the whole, theres a spark of investor confidence in the firm on account of improving sales in the UCP business.

0.56,"Last week, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the shipping industrys global regulator, took two significant stepsone, to cut the sulphur content of fuel oil used by ships and, second, to introduce a new data collection system on fuel oil used by shipsin a clear road map to help shipping meet its environment obligations as it looks to align the industry with the global climate change goals.
				   
				Shippings current share of the worlds carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is a reflection of an industry that transports almost 10 billion tonnes of cargo a year. It may be out of sight, but cargo shipping (about 70,000 ships) keeps the world economy running.About 90% of global trade is moved by cargo ships, which are collectively responsible for about 2.2% of the world's total green house gas (GHG) emissions.Beginning 1 January 2020, ships must use fuel oil on board with a sulphur content of no more than 0.5% m/m (mass/mass), a steep cut from the current global sulphur cap of 3.5% m/m, which has been in force since 1 January 2012. Ships can meet the requirement by using low-sulphur fuel oil.The reductions in sulphur oxide emissions resulting from the lower global sulphur cap are expected to have a significant beneficial impact on the environment and on human health, particularly that of people living in port cities and coastal communities, beyond the existing emission control areas, IMO secretary general Kitack Lim said after the agencys marine environment protection committee (MEPC) took the decision at a 24-28 October meeting in London.In 2008, IMO set progressive stricter regulations to control emissions from ships, including sulphur oxides (SOx) and nitrous oxides (NOx).At that time, IMO agreed a review would be done by 2018 to assess whether sufficient compliant fuel oil would be available to meet the 2020 date. If not, the date could be deferred to 2025. The review, completed in 2016, concluded that sufficient compliant fuel oil would be available to meet the new sulphur content limit.The new IMO rule poses significant challenges to global oil refiners and on the economics of shippingcompliant fuel is expected to cost between 50% and 100% more than the residual fuel that most ships currently burn.The additional cost of compliant low sulphur fuels, perhaps as much as US$50-100 billion a year globally, will give further impetus to efforts by shipowners to minimize fuel consumption. The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), the global trade lobby for shipowners, says there is much to do between now and 2020 to ensure sufficient quantities of compliant marine fuel of the right quality will indeed be available, and that this radical switch over to cleaner fuels will be implemented smoothly, in a harmonized manner, without distorting shipping markets or having negative impacts on the movement of world trade.The clear decision by IMO on implementation in 2020 should make it easier for shipowners to consider alternative compliance options such as fitting exhaust gas-cleaning systems or so-called scrubbers or using low sulphur fuels such as liquefied natural gas (LNG). However, overall uncertainty about future oil and gas pricesaside from the uncertainty about likely differentials between low sulphur and residual fuel in 2020mean such decisions will not be easy.This major regulatory change should ensure fuel, by far, will continue to be the shipowners largest operating cost, providing a serious further incentive to continue reducing CO2 emissions, ICS secretary general Peter Hinchliffe said.On the other side, the new mandatory data collection system agreed by IMO at the London meet is intended to be the first in a three-step approach in which an analysis of the data collected would provide the basis for an objective, transparent and inclusive policy debate in MEPC. The data collected would allow a decision to be made on whether any further measures are needed to enhance energy efficiency and address GHG emissions from global shipping. Under the new requirements, ships of 5,000 gross tonnage and above must collect consumption data for each type of fuel oil they use. These ships account for approximately 85% of CO2 emissions from international shipping.MEPC also approved a road map (2017 through to 2023) for developing a comprehensive IMO strategy on reduction of GHG emissions from ships, which foresees an initial CO2 reduction commitments to be agreed by 2018. It includes a list of activities such as IMO GHG studies with relevant timelines and provides for an alignment of those new activities with the ongoing work by MEPC on the three-step approach to ship energy efficiency improvements. This alignment provides a way forward to the adoption of a revised strategy in 2023 to include short-, medium- and long-term further measures. Under the road map, and to provide long-term vision for the shipping sector, MEPC has to address a number of important questions, such as what role the global shipping sector should play in supporting the goals of the Paris agreement on climate change. In 2011, IMO became the first global body to adopt mandatory energy-efficiency measures for an entire industry sector with a suite of technical and operational requirements for new and existing vessels that came into force in 2013. By 2025, all new ships built will be 30% more energy efficient than those built in 2014.The data system will foster the development of a mechanism by IMO for ensuring CO2 reduction commitments are met. The global shipping industry reduced its total CO2 emissions by more than 10% between 2007 and 2012, and projections for future growth in maritime trade demand are being revised down, compared with those used in the most recent 2014 IMO GHG emissions study. The IMO road map is a significant step forward because it has the agreement of developing nations that are understandably concerned about the possible impact on the cost of maritime trade.

Compressed natural gas (CNG) volume increased 8% from a year earlier and piped natural gas (PNG) volume grew 9%. The company derives about three-fourths of its volume from the CNG business. Unfortunately, a decline in price realization for both segments meant IGLs revenue for the quarter fell 3.4% to Rs.882 crore.
				   
				However, a decline in raw material costs led to a 300 basis points (bps) expansion in operating profit margin to 22%. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

A strong operating profit performance and a slower rate of increase in depreciation costs helped net profit growth of 12% to Rs.108 crore.Analysts expect profit margins to improve. We expect some margin improvement from 1QFY17 onwards due to a lower CNG price cut announced by IGL post the 20% domestic gas price cut since April, pointed out analysts from Jefferies India Pvt.

1.0,"New Delhi: With its eyes set on doubling Indias present installed wind power by 2022, the ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE) has revised guidelines for onshore wind power projects. 
				   
				At present (till end-September), India has 28.1 giga watt (GW) of wind power installed capacity across the country and the Central government has set an ambitious target of generating 60GW by 2022. To achieve that target, MNRE believes that the current rate of deployment of wind power capacity is required to be more than doubled. The guidelines were revised to address new-age problems and reduce delays.India first came out with guidelines for development of onshore wind power projects in 1995 to ensure proper growth of the wind power sector. The guidelines were then revised in 1996. Since then, this is the first major revision.The guidelines aim to facilitate development of wind power projects in an efficient, cost effective and environmentally benign manner. They address all major issues like land use permission, availability of wind resource, grid connectivity, transport logistics, environmental acceptability, micrositing, health and safety, hybridization, repowering and decommission plan.The project developer should ensure that the land being selected for the wind power project can be legally used for the purpose and all regulations regarding land use/land cover are complied with, said the guidelines which were issued on 22 October. They clarified that in case of land allotment by the state government for the wind power project, a maximum period of four years may be allowed for development and start of commissioning of the project. But if there is a delay, then the land allotment may be cancelled.To address the issue of grid connectivity, the guidelines said that the project developer should ensure that grid connectivity is technically and commercially feasible at the site selected.If the site being selected falls in the area of forest land or in the vicinity of habitat of migratory birds and their flight routes, civil aviation, defence and heritage establishments the project developer should ensure availability of necessary clearances from concerning authorities, they added.It added that to ensure health and safety of people working/residing near the wind power installations the NIWE (National Institute of Wind Energy) will prescribe criteria for noise and shadow flicker in consultation with stakeholders.The guidelines also stated that a proposal to establish wind power project should necessarily include a decommissioning plan of the wind turbine after completion of its useful life.The NIWE will formulate guidelines for decommissioning of the wind turbines in consultation with stakeholders, it added.As per the MNRE, the need for such guidelines were felt because of advancement in the wind turbine technology, requirement to comply various standards and regulations issued by CEA (Central Electricity Authority) and other regulatory bodies, to address issues related to micrositing, decommissioning, health and safety.For instance, over the past 20 years, the wind turbine technology in India has evolved from less efficient turbines with low capacity of 225 KW to more efficient turbines with high capacity of 3 mega watt being manufactured in India.Indias total installed renewable capacity currently is around 44.2GW and significance of wind power in India can be assumed from the fact it amounts to over 60% of the total installed renewable power.

The pipeline can carry 3.75 million tons of LPG every year. LPG demand in India grew 10.5% in 2016, and is expected to go up in the coming years. Global demand for LPG is estimated to grow to 380 million tons by 2024 from 278 million tons in 2015, mostly driven by emerging economies.Tell me more: The longest LPG pipeline at present is 1415 kms long and carries 2.5m tonnes of LPG from Jamnagar in Gujarat to Loni near Delhi. Its operated by GAIL India.31,762What is it? The number of bottles of anti depressant tablets being recalled from US market by Sun Pharmaceutical.Why is it important? While the recall is voluntary and is categorised as class 3 (no health consequence because of violation), the event underlines the growing tension between Indian pharmaceutical majors and the US Food and Drug Administration. The US regulator has increased its headcount in India to 19 from 12 earlier, with more drug production units under inspection. The number of warning letters for failing to meet standards have gone up too. This includes Suns Halol unit in Gujarat which made the anti depressant tablets.Tell me more: The recalled drug is bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets. US accounts for over half of Suns revenues. $120 millionWhat is it? The value of stocks, stock options and retirement benefits that Wells Fargos chairman and chief executive John Stumpf will be walking away with after the bank announced his retirement on Wednesday effective immediately. Why is it important? Wells Fargo is under fire for creating over 1.5 million checking and savings accounts and 500,000 credit cards that its customers never authorized and was fined $185 million by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for the offence. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who famously grilled him over the scam during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in September, tweeted she would still want Stumpf to return every nickel he made during the scam, & face DOJ/SEC investigation. Tell me more: Stumpf will be replaced by two Wells Fargo insiders.

				As the company resumed production of fertilizers using spot natural gas, it reduced its trading business. From less than 44% a year ago, the contribution of revenue from manufacturing has gone up to about 55% in the last quarter.This helped Deepak Fertilisers  expand margins 2.9 percentage points to 8.9%. Operating profit, or Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), jumped 52% and net profit more than doubled to Rs.26 crore.The chemicals business did well. Operating profit at the business more than doubled as the segment benefited from higher volumes. Margins at the segment almost doubled. Margins in manufactured products showed improvement during the quarter. The acids business and technical ammonium nitrate recorded a substantial growth in volumes as compared to the same quarter in the previous year, the company said in a statement.Fertilizers, on the other hand, posted an operating loss of Rs.2.7 crore as the business was not able to recover fixed costs fully. The strong operating performance of the chemicals business negated this loss.Deepak Fertilisers saw a substantial rise in inventories and short-term borrowings from March this year. Trade receivables jumped 53% as the subsidy from the government has been delayed. During the quarter, the company launched a water soluble fertilizer, which may have added to inventories.While a good winter crop season can help lower inventories, resumption of gas supplies under the administered price mechanism remains crucial for Deepak Fertilisers. Though the company has received a favourable court verdict on this, supply has not resumed yet. Resumption of domestic gas supply will help the firm operate its plants at an optimal level and extract better economies of scale. With spot gas, Deepak Fertilisers will not be able to attain a similar cost structure, say analysts. We await more clarity on gas resumption.

				MAIN SECTIONMistry familys allegations Mismanagement at Tata Sons and oppression of minority shareholdersRatan Tata abused the powers vested in him as the erstwhile chairman of the Tata group in terms of the various businesses entered into which includes Nano car project, acquisition of Corus, Tata Teleservices, Air Asia, dealings C. Sivasankaran and M Pallonji & Co.Corporate governance breakdown and excessive interference by Tata TrustsTata and other trustees, acting as shadow directors, have been controlling Tata Sons as a super-board with trustee-nominated directors accustomed to act under the instructions of Tata Trusts, which hold 66% in Tata Sons. The trustees sought to micro manage the governance of Tata Sons.Illegal removal of the executive chairmanThe executive chairman was removed without any notice or explanation. Abuse of articles of associationThe article of associations of Tata Sons, whose aim was to have a governance framework to protect the firms interests, have been converted into a regime enabling the control of Tata Sons by Ratan Tata and Noshir Soonawala, trustees of the Tata Trusts.Violation of insider trading normsLaw violations by Tata and Noshir Soonawala , a trustee for procuring unpublished price sensitive information from listed Tata companies.Tata Sons responseIssues raised are nothing but a ruse by Cyrus Mistry. This is merely to publicly express his displeasure at the loss of his office as the executive chairman of Tata Sons. It is an attempt to besmirch the reputation of the Tata group.Mistrys removal not illegalMistrys removal was resolved upon by a majority of the directors (seven out of nine directors who voted in favour of Mistrys removal as the executive chairman).Mistry was well acquainted with the affairs of Tata Sons and the Tata group  This was much before Mistry became the executive chairman in December 2012. He was part of the boards deliberations in respect of several decisions which he is now attempting to call into question.Why now? Mistry is seeking to justify the inexplicable delay by the petitioner in availing judicial remedies. He did not take the requisite step to address the alleged mismanagement and oppression nor did he bring it to the notice of the board of Tata Sons. He rose from slumber to voice this grievance only after he was removed.Allegations levelled against Ratan Tata misconceived All decisions at Tata Sons and Tata companies have been taken by the relevant management teams. In his own draft presentation Mistry had proposed an active and consistent engagement with the trusts and the trust nominee directors.No special treatment to C. Sivasankaran The allegations with respect to the instances of dealings with C. Sivasankaran, chairman of the Siva group, are not relevant to the present proceedings for alleged oppression of the petitioners and alleged mismanagement of the affairs of Tata Sons. There is absolutely nothing on record to suggest that these transactions involved a degree of undue favour or special treatment at the behest of Tata group companies.Flawed business decision do not tantamount to acts of oppression Assuming but without conceding that these business decisions were in fact flawed and imprudent, such transactions do not tantamount to acts of oppression or mismanagement as is the settled legal position.What Mistry family has asked the NCLTWind up Tata Sons board and appointment of an administrator or appoint a retired Supreme Court judge as the non-executive chairman and appoint new independent directors.Restrain the so-called interim chairman from attending any meeting of the board of directors.Restrain Noshir Soonawala from interfering in the affairs of Tata Sons.Direct Tata Sons to not issue any securities which could lead to a dilution in the present equity capital.Restraint the respondent to the petition which includes Tata Sons, Tata Trusts and Ratan Tata from making any changes to the article of association unless its done with the consent of the honourable tribunal.Appoint an independent auditor to conduct a forensic accounting and independent investigations into the transactions of Air Asia, involving Mehli Mistry and associated entities, C. Sivasankaran and his business entities. And submit a report to the tribunal.Appoint an inspector to investigate into the of Sebis prohibition of insider trading breach by Ratan Tata and Noshir Soonawala and submit a report to the tribunal so that it can refer the findings to the Serious Fraud Investigation Office of the ministry of corporate affairs.Appoint a forensic auditor to re-investigateDirect Tata Trusts to bring back into Tata Sons the funds used by Tata Sons for acquiring shares of Tata Motors.Restrain Tata Sons from entering any new line of business or acquiring any new business without the consent of the tribunal and that to after it has been discussed with the board of directors without applying 121 of article of association.Restrain the trustees from interfering in affairs of Tata Sons and various companies that are part of Tata group.Restrain the existing selection committee from discharging any duty and appoint a new committee.Direct that no candidate selected by the committee pursuant to the article 118 of the article of association of Tata Sons be appointed without the consent of the Tribunal.Direct Tata Sons not to demand unpublished price sensitive information from any listed Tata group companyPass an order which is in the interest of justice and brings an end to the acts of oppression and mismanagement.SECOND SECTION Face-off: Ratan Tata vs Cyrus MistryThe genesis of the current crisis emanated from the personality differences between the then chairman of Tata Sons and chairman emeritus. Here are the few key issues which became the bone of contention between the two.Allegations against Ratan TataA chairman who never retired.His insistence of being a super board by wanting to pre-vet and pre-decide what gets formal approval to the Tata Sons board shows he was never happy being chairman emeritus but saw himself as chairman who never retired.Board of Tata Sons removed Mistry at the behest of Ratan Tata.It was under the influence of Tata that the board ousted Mistry.Remote controlling operations of Tata group companies.Tata was seeking to control key decisions in key Tata group companies through abuse and misuse of article of association. Any deviation from the approach sought by him would be attacked by him as a violation of articles of association.Aviation misadventure, Nano car project and flawed overseas acquisition strategy. Ratan Tatas passion for flying and aviation industry in general led the Tata group into aviation business. Every decision in the sector relating to Taj Air, B Jets, Piaggio Aero and more recently AirAsia and Vistara has inflicted serious damage to Tata group and to Tata Sons interests.As there is no line of sight to profitability for the Nano, any turnaround strategy for the company requires to shut it down. Emotional reasons alone have kept the company away from this crucial decision. The foreign acquisition strategy, with the exceptions of JLR and Tetley, had left a large debt overhang.Friends of Ratan Tata While some of them were bestowed powers to commit serious investment decisions on behalf of the Tata Sons while others were granted extraordinary and undue favours. These include Mehli Mistry, the chairman of M. Pallonji group, won contracts from Tata Power Co. Ltd at rates much higher than the prevalent market rates, while due to the special treatment, C. Sivasankaran, chairman Siva group, made a fortune by investing in Tata Teleservices Ltd (TTSL).RATAN TATAs RESPONSEOn him being a super board The allegations are unfounded. It is at Mistrys invitation that he was made chairman emeritus. Such an invitation would not have been extended had Mistry harboured such fundamental objections to Tatas term as chairman. Even upon assuming office, Mistry continued to seek Tatas guidance and views.On Mistrys removal Mistrys removal as the chairman of Tata Sons was led by the complete erosion of confidence and widening of trust deficit amongst the board of directors of Tata Sons and a similar trust deficit between Mistry and Tata Sons principal shareholders.On remote controlling operations Tata offered his opinion only on being asked by Mistry and his views were not unsolicited. Tata also presented his well-intentioned point of view and shared his thoughts wherever he felt that doing so would further the best interests of Tata group. To now colour this as interference amounting to a case of oppressive conduct is regrettable to say the least. Mistrys petition is nothing but a personal attack with a view to besmirch Tata based on false and baseless allegations.On acquisitionsThe decision to acquire Corus at the stipulated price was the unanimous and conscious decision of the entire board of directors of Tata Steel in 2007. In fact, the board of Tata Sons, including Mistry, passed a board resolution for financing the acquisition by Tata Steel.On Tatas persistent resistance to shelve Nano project  He did not raise any objections in view of the volumes and contributions being made by the project. It is entirely without basis for Mistry to contend that it was Tata who thrusted the decision to continue with Nano upon the incumbent management of Tata Motors.On aviation misadventure The investments made by Tata Sons in the aviation sector, was an unanimous decision of the board. In fact, Mistry in his webcast to all the employees of Tata group recognized Tatas contribution in the aerospace plans. The documents placed on record by Mistry himself reveal that he constantly sought Tatas advice and inputs on the issues inflicting Tata Sons in the aviation sector.Response to the allegations regarding the special relationshipsOn C. SivasankaranIt is highly unjustified that Mistrys after all these years contends that TTSL investment or any other engagement with Sivasankarans companies, was driven by personal relationships rather than the collective commercial wisdom of the board of Tata Teleservices Ltd.On Mehli MistryIt is also wrong to say that when Mistry took over as executive chairman of the Tata group, he pursued a policy of all Tata group companies awarding large contracts solely because of competitive bidding to ensure that the Tata group companies receive the maximum benefit possible from their contracts with third parties. Such statement clearly insinuates that before Mistrys tenure, the contracts were being awarded by the Tata group companies without following a due process.Sapna Agarwal contributed to this story.",2017-01-31,NUG4OYNFBmmDMQ5mHsyGvL,"The National Company Law Tribunal, or NCLT, will start hearing the petition from Tuesday  on the Tata Sons-Cyrus Mistry row",10:39,Tata Sons-Cyrus Mistry spat: What the affidavits say
0.54,"New Delhi: Sweating during frequent power cuts? You may soon be able to use natural gas-run air-conditioners at home.
				   
				Indraprastha Gas Ltd., an arm of state-owned gas utility Gail (India) Ltd will soon introduce air-conditioners running on gas in collaboration with a few New Zealand-based manufacturers in a bid to increase gas consumption in the country, managing director E.S. Ranganathan said.The gas utility, which has 6.5 lakh customers for piped gas in the national capital region and has a target of reaching 11 lakh in three years, is trying to create new markets for gas by diversifying into appliances running on the clean fuel. It has already started promoting gas-run power generators in institutions and residential complexes which replace costly and polluting diesel generation sets.The move is part of the oil ministrys plan to shift towards a gas-based economy in which the clean fuel will replace diesel and coal for power generation and petrol and diesel for transportation (by way of condensed natural gas or CNG). Government wants the share of gas in the hydrocarbon mix to go up from about 7% now to 25% in a few years.Our business development group is working on introducing air conditioners and geysers running on gas. This will be useful in areas such as Ghaziabad in the national capital region or Rewari in Haryana, where there are four hours of power cut, said Ranganathan.IGLs idea is to introduce a cost effective air conditioner, which will enable the consumer to recover the cost in a short time from savings on power consumption. There are some overseas manufacturers of gas engine air conditioners. We will tie up with those producers who can market it here and when it catches on, they can start manufacturing here, said Ranganathan.IGL has called a meeting of leading domestic and multinational producers of gas based power generators to draw up a financing scheme for consumers. More than IGL, it will be producers of gas-based appliances who will benefit from an evolving gas market, said Ranganathan. The cost of power from a diesel-run generator is about Rs19, while a gas based one could produce power for about Rs6-7 a unit.The average piped natural gas (PNG) consumption per household for cooking is about half a cubic meter a day, which translates to a monthly bill of about Rs360.With a target of adding 1.5 lakh customers every year, IGL is spending Rs300 crore this year and another Rs350 crore in the next to add more CNG stations and to lay more pipelines. The oil ministry has a target of raising PNG customers from 39 lakh now in the country to one crore in a few years.With gas consumption going up, IGL may have to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) to meet demand in the future. According to Kalpana Jain, senior director, Deloitte in India, at least in the foreseeable future, the country will remain dependent on imports for gas. For the moment, the going seems to be really good and all the projections seem to suggest that gas price is not going to go through the roof. Going by the investments flowing to construction of LNG import terminals and pipelines, there is a strong case for placing gas as a significant part in our clean energy portfolio, said Jain.",2016-10-13,NsSnxGSh9BcCmCHK3nZQzJ,"Indraprastha Gas , which has 6.5 lakh customers for piped gas in NCR, is trying to create new markets for gas by diversifying into appliances running on the clean fuel",19:15,Indraprastha Gas to introduce CNG-run air conditioners

The vessels are the first to feature new membrane technology from French specialist Gaztransport & Technigaz SA(GTT), considered key to the execution of the project.With a capacity of 87,000 cubic meters, the two vessels are the largest ethane carriers built to date.In a ceremony held in Geoje (South Korea), RIL inaugurated its very first two VLECs, GTT said in a statement.The two vessels, named Ethane Crystal and Ethane Emerald, are the first in a series of six VLECs ordered by RIL in 2014.Japans biggest shipping company Mitsui OSK Lines Pvt. Ltd will manage and operate the ships for RIL.Ethane, a natural gas component, is expected to be produced in large volumes in North America due to the shale gas revolution, which has generated an abundance of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Ethane is primarily used as a petrochemical feedstock to produce ethylene by steam cracking.RIL plans to ship 1.5 million tonnes a year of ethane from its US shale joint ventures to its chemical complex in Gujarat. The firm has two joint ventures (JVs) in Pennsylvanias Marcellus Shaleone with Chevron Corp., in which it has invested $1.7 billion, and another with Houston-based Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc., in which it has invested $392 million. It has a third JV, in which it invested $1.5 billion, in Texas Eagle Ford Shale group with Dallas-based Pioneer Natural Resources Co.The worlds richest energy billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led RILs business spans petrochemicals, exploration and production, retail and telecommunications. As per the original contract, Samsung was to deliver the ships to be used for ethane transportation, from October 2016 to January 2017. Each ship is priced at $120 million.VLECs are a hybrid of LNG and LPG carriers. Due to the expectation of competitively priced ethane as opposed to naphtha, a crude oil byproduct, petrochemical producers are hoping to lower their production costs by using ethane.The VLECs are to transport liquefied ethane from the US to the Dahej terminal in Gujarat, which will be used to supply feedstock for RILs crackers in Dahej, Hazira and Nagothane.RIL has an ethane supply contract in place with Enterprise Product Partners out of their Morgans Point terminal in the US Gulf, which exported its first ethane cargo in September on a 27,500 cubic meter vessel for Ineos.Earlier this week, RIL had stated that it has secured a $573 million of loan for part-financing of the vessel construction costs.",2016-10-28,OGRgM8F15eacBFWFH19ugP,"The two vessels, named Ethane Crystal and Ethane Emerald, are the first in a series of six Very Large Ethane Carriers ordered by RIL in 2014",20:22,RIL gets worlds first very large ethane-carrying ships

				LPG consumption is growing by over 10% and private refiners RIL and Essar Oil want a pie of it. Currently, public sector retailers Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum control retail LPG market, selling cooking gas in 5-kg, 14.2-kg and 19-kg cylinders. They sell 12 cylinders of 14.2-kg or 34 bottles of 5-kg per year to households on subsidized rates and any requirement above that on market price. The 19-kg cylinder is for commercial use. Private firms are not entitled for government subsidy and they have to sell fuel at market price. But with the government restricting volume of subsidy as well as barring consumers earning more than Rs10 lakh per annum from subsidised LPG, a ready-made market is now available for private oil companies. Mobile App rolled in all operating states to enhance customer experience, RIL said in the presentation. The company sells most of the LPG produced by its twin refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat to public sector retailers. While RIL did not disclose the price at which it is marketing the 4-kg cylinder, a 5-kg subsidized domestic LPG cylinder costs Rs58.50 in Delhi. A 5-kg cylinder for domestic use is priced at Rs181 while it costs Rs252.50 for non-domestic use. A subsidised 14.2-kg cylinder costs Rs427 in Delhi and a non-subsidized bottle comes for Rs490. A 19-kg cylinder is priced at Rs895. Domestic LPG consumption rose 10.8% in April-September this year to 10.2 million tonnes, nearly half of which was imported. The government had last year permitted RIL to sell up to 1.2 lakh tonnes of LPG produced at its plants to private cooking gas marketers. The LPG Control Order mandates that all cooking gas (LPG) produced locally must be supplied to state-run fuel retailing companies as India is deficient in LPG and has to import a part of the requirement. However, under the Parallel Marketing Scheme (PMS), private companies are allowed to import and market LPG to bulk consumers. Packed LPG business sales grew at 10% year-on-year basis, the company said in the presentation.

0.59,"The government announced a slew of measures in the hydrocarbon sector on Thursday that are expected to have a positive impact on the Indian energy sector in the long run. Importantly, there will be a uniform licensing system which will cover all hydrocarbons, i.e. oil, gas, coal bed methane, etc., which should help companies explore all kinds of oil and gas resources under one licence.
				   
				The blocks under the new policy will be awarded through an open-acreage policy, which will enable E&P (exploration and production) companies choose the blocks from the designated area. Also, there is a shift to a revenue-sharing model, which will be easy to administer for the government. The measures announced are positive for the sector and are expected to simplify licensing rules and accordingly boost investments in the sector.Whats in it for investors?One of the key announcements made is allowing pricing and marketing freedom for natural gas produced from difficult terrain. This would be applicable to all discoveries in deep water/ultra-deep water/high temperature/high pressure areas which were yet to commence commercial production as on 1 January 2016 and for all future discoveries in such areas.However, there is a ceiling price, which means that prices will not be totally free. According to analysts, the ceiling price based on new guidelines, starting 1 April works out to $6-6.5 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). Domestic gas prices are at $3.82 per mmBtu currently. That looks attractive but its important to realize that the benefits from this development are not going to be visible in the near future.As Nitin Tiwari, an analyst at Antique Stock Broking Pvt. Ltd, says, the new pricing for production from difficult fields could be beneficial for Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) when its KG-DWN-98/2 starts production. Similarly, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) too could benefit when it starts production from its R-Cluster and satellite fields. However, production from the above mentioned fields may start by FY19 or beyond, which means benefits from the development are accordingly going to accrue in the longer-run, than in near term, points out Tiwari.Secondly, the state of the macro environment and commodity (crude/NG/FO) prices would also be crucial for above mentioned developments as policy itself is not a sufficient condition to facilitate investment, he adds. The government has also said that in case of pending arbitration or litigation pertaining to gas pricing covering such fields, the new rules will be applicable only on the conclusion/withdrawal of such litigation/arbitration. This does not augur well for RIL, which is currently in a legal battle with the government over gas pricing.

1.0,"Singapore: What does Cyrus Mistry want? Ever since his summary 24 October dismissal as chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, the spurned executive has demanded a reason for his sacking from the holding company of Indias $103 billion salt-to-software conglomerate.
				   
				At the same time, Mistry, 48, has accused Ratan Tata, the 78-year-old who wrested back control of the group, of everything from a control fetish to governance failures and bad judgment. According to Mistry, Ratan Tatas 2006 purchase of Corus Group Plcs British steel assets, his vanity small-car project as well as the acquisition of pricey hotels have exposed the empire that bears his familys name to an existential threat.Some of this could just be wounded pride, but even if Mistrys allegations have a kernel of truth, what does he gain from trash-talking a group in which his family owns 18.4%? One possible answer is that he mightif he can convince enough outside investors in operating companies to side with himprize open the loosely controlled conglomerate, and pluck out a big reward.Tuesdays shareholder meeting of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, the software business, may have been a practice session in that treasure hunt. Tata Sons 73% stake in TCS was enough for Ratan Tata to get Mistry thrown out as its chairman. But at five other companiesIndian Hotels Co.

Mistrys own core supporters, fired together with him, have no clout. But Nusli Wadia, the scion of one of Indias oldest business families, is a heavyweight. He has spent a combined 90 years on three Tata boards.At Tata Steel, where Wadia is the longest-serving independent director, hes already questioning the validity of the companys brand licensing agreement with Tata Sons, a younger company that received its first royalty payment 91 years after the steelmakers founding. Wadia wants an examination of the agreement.A similar suggestion at Tata Motors, where Wadia has been on the board for 18 years, would be a thinly veiled call for mutiny. The ultimate prize may be Jaguar Land Rover, the crowning glory of Ratan Tatas dealmaking career.Tata Sons boosted its stake in Tata Motors by 1.7% on the day of the TCS vote, and is open to buying more ahead of the 22 December extraordinary general meeting. This must be the Wadia effect. Even at TCS, retail shareholders overwhelmingly voted against Mistrys ouster. If Wadias PR spiel can swing enough of them away from Ratan Tata, the latters control of Jaguar Land Rover might be at risk, provided Mistry can raise money for an open offer to shareholders, a condition on which the market regulator may well insist. And that could split the empire.Also read: Message for Tata Sons in bittersweet victory at TCS EGMOn both sides, theres much high-minded talk about values, and how the other camp was ruining the groups reputation for fair play by cutting ethical corners.

0.65,"New Delhi: Power minister Piyush Goyal on Monday pitched for wider use of smart electricity meters and urged the electrical equipment industry to come up with innovations that suit the domestic consumer as the country strives to use energy efficiently.
				   
				Addressing industry executives at the beginning of a three-day conference organized by the Indian Electrical & Electronics Manufacturers Association (IEEMA), Goyal said smart meters, which are crucial for a roof-top solar power plant which is connected to the grid to sell surplus power, can be a game changer. Selling surplus power to the grid enables a roof top solar power plant owner to recover the cost of the plant.I am given to understand that in some smart meter tender for only 10,000 units, the quotations were of Rs3,000. Now if 10,000 meters can be bought or sold for Rs3,000, imagine the price that can be discovered at a scale of 25 crore smart meters. We have the example of LED bulbs, Goyal said. The governments efficient lighting programme has led to a decline in the public procurement price of LED bulbs sharply to just over Rs 50 apiece from more than Rs300 less than two years ago. Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd. is now installing 200,000 smart meters and is planning to scale it up to 1.5 million in five to six years, while Reliance Power Ltd-owned BSES Yamuna Power Ltd and BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd, which supply electricity in Delhi, are also installing smart meters for customers in phases. Smart meter can be a game changer when it comes to planning the electricity sector in the long run, said Goyal. The central government is prompting state-owned power distribution utilities to improve operational and billing efficiency under the Ujjwal Assurance Discom Yojna rolled out in November 2015. Our electrical industry should come up with indigenous innovation. It is important that we look at our own situation and come up with solutions relevant for the Indian consumer, our climate and our level of incomes, said Goyal.",2017-01-23,PSxpwX4A93xUe5xycZRHfK,Power minister urges electrical equipment manufacturers to come up with innovations that suit the domestic consumer,21:38,Piyush Goyal pitches for wider use of smart electricity meters
0.05,"Mumbai: Running a marathon is a metaphor for Natarajan Chandrasekarans career. 
				   
				Twice over.In Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), a business he will lead until 21 February, Chandra, as he is popularly known, has spent almost 30 years, his entire working life.He started as a software programmer with TCS in 1987 and rose through the ranks to become one of the youngest chief executive officers (CEOs) in Tata group when he was 46 years old in 2009.Now, as he prepares to take over as chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, Chandrasekaran is in effect getting ready to run another marathon.He is 53 and the retirement age for top Tata executives is 70, giving him a potential 17 years at the helm of the $103-billion group that has businesses ranging from salt to steel and tea to telecom.Running a marathon is also a metaphor for running a business, according to Chandrasekaran.You have to decide on the length of the engagement, develop endurance to handle setbacks and increase speed when the competition demands it, Chandrasekaran said in an interview to Runners World magazine in October 2015 (bit.ly/2iFOCtK).You have to perform with your heart and your mind; you will not get lost on the way if you have a good road map; you will get nowhere without discipline. This is what I always tell my employees in speeches, he said.He will start running his new marathon at a time when Tata group is in the midst of a bruising battle with its former chairman, Cyrus Mistry, who was sacked on 24 October in a boardroom putsch, less than four years after he succeeded family scion Ratan Tata.Also read: Tata vs Mistry: NCLT dismisses contempt of court plea filed by Mistry firmsThe feud between Mistry, who has accused the 149-year old business house of a variety of corporate governance violations, and Tata has reached the National Company Law Tribunal, or NCLT, where a long and messy legal battle is looming.The Mistry family is the largest minority shareholder in Tata Sons, the holding company of the group.We are at an inflection point, Chandrasekaran wrote in an emailed statement after his appointment. I am aware that this role comes with huge responsibilities. It will be my endeavour to help progress the group with the ethos, ethics and values that the Tata group has been built on.A Tata Sons spokesperson said the chairman-designate was not available for interviews immediately.Chandrasekaran, we believe will now inspire the entire Tata group to realize its potential acting as leaders in their respective businesses, always in keeping with our value system and ethics and adhering with the practices of the Tata group which have stood it in good stead, the Tata Sons board said in a statement on 12 January while announcing his elevation. The five-member selection committee chose him unanimously, it added.Also read: Tata Sons new chairman has twin obstaclesa family and a conglomerateChandrasekaran would be no stranger to the value systems and the practices that the board is talking about. The man who would have been a farmer joined the company after completing his Masters degree in computer applications from the Regional Engineering College in Trichy, Tamil Nadu. Over time, he has worked in a variety of positions (chief operating officer, executive assistant to S. Ramadorai, the previous CEO), and places (California and Stockholm). In that sense, he is an insider.He is an outsider because he is the first truly professional chairman of the Tata Sons board who is not related to the Tata family.Nowroji Saklatwala, the third chairman of the group, was the nephew of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of Tata group. Cyrus Mistry is the brother-in-law of Noel Tata, half brother of Ratan Tata.This can be interpreted in two ways: Either the Tatas chose a safe option by choosing an insider, or the group took a step forward to regain its tarnished credibility by choosing a non-family memberand one with a proven track recordto lead the firm.Also read: N. Chandrasekaran begins long road to restoring Tata groups imageIndeed, Chandrasekarans first task will be to restore the reputation of the group and the sheen of brand Tata.A day after his ouster, Mistry (in a letter that subsequently found its way into the public domain) said the Tata group was beset with a host of corporate governance issues.The group was staring at a potential $18-billion write-down, he claimed. It persisted with a loss-making project, the Nano small car, because it was an obsession with Ratan Tata; there was undue interference from some of the trustees of the Tata Trusts, which own two-thirds of Tata Sons; some friends and associates of Ratan Tata benefited from Tata group contractsthey all were a part of Mistrys lists of allegations.Subsequently, the listed companies of the Tata group lost 6.1% (till 16 January) of their market capitalization, and regulators began asking questions.The controversy at Tata group is not his (Chandrasekarans) creation. He just needs to ride it out. I think if he can build a reasonably supportive relationship with Cyrus, it will be good for the image of corporate India, said Ganesh Natarajan, vice-chairman at Zensar Technologies Ltd, who has worked with Chandrasekaran at software industry lobby Nasscom.Restoring the reputation is just a start. The fact remains that the Tata group has several underperformers. The so-called legacy hot spots which were named by MistryTata Power Co. Ltds Mundra plant in western Gujarat, Tata Steel Europe, Indian Hotels Co. Ltd, Tata Teleservices Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd passenger vehiclesall are pressure points.For instance, in the four years to fiscal 2016, Tata Steel has taken an impairment charge of at least Rs24,175 crore, most of it attributed to the European assets that it acquired with the 2007 purchase of Corus Group Plc for £6.7 billion (Rs54,000 crore today).In the past fiscal, losses at Coastal Gujarat Power Ltd (CGPL), which houses the Mundra plant, were Rs1,491.86 crore.Looking at data aggregated between 2011 and 2015 and limit the analysis largely to the legacy hot spots, it will show that the capital employed in those companies has risen from Rs1.32 trillion to Rs1.96 trillion A realistic assessment of the fair value of these businesses could potentially result in a write-down over time of Rs1.18 trillion, Mistry pointed out in his letter.But it wont be easy to rejuvenate these businesses. Selling or exiting them wont be a quick option since it will call into question the business wisdom and legacy of group patriarch Ratan Tata.Look at Tata Steel. Corus is a disaster, said T.V. Mohandas Pai, chairman of Manipal Global Education and former board of director at Infosys Ltd. Cyrus tried to change that by selling assets, but they ousted him as they said it was against Tata values, said Pai.Tata values, he said, cannot be based on destruction of shareholders value.Pai terms Chandrasekaran as a go getter who is great at marketing and building relationships, but he is not sure if he will get the much-needed free hand to run Tata Sons.Once he takes charge at Tata Sons, the key issue wont be whether he will be able to do well, but whether he will have operational freedom, he said.This talk of freedom to operate that Pai is talking about goes to the crux of Mistrys accusations.Mistry, in his 25 October letter, said he had been reduced to the position of a lame duck chairman.He accused Tata Trusts and some of the trusteesRatan Tata and Noshir Soonawala, in particularof excessive interference in the running of listed Tata companies.Documents filed by the Mistry family firmsCyrus Investments Pvt. Ltd and Sterling Investments Pvt. Ltdin NCLT alleged mismanagement of Tata Sons and oppression of minority shareholders, cited some examples and called them shadow directors.These charges have been strongly refuted by Tata and Soonawala in affidavits they filed in reply.Also read: Why Natarajan Chandrasekaran is a safe choice for Ratan TataLeaving this issue aside, Chandrasekaran will anyway have to establish a good working relationship with the principal shareholders of Tata Sons, both in terms of navigating the three-tier structure of the groupTata Trusts, Tata Sons and Tata group operating companiesand in meeting their expectations.Already, the trustees have come out with statements highlighting their concerns.The new leadership at Tata Sons should ensure that the overall profitability and income of the group improves, and the dividend payout by Tata Sons to Tata Trusts not only stabilizes but also increases, said V.R. Mehta, a trustee of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, in an interview, a day after Chandrasekarans elevation was announced.The main worry of the trust was the decline in the dividend income of Tata Sons from the operating companies, he said.In a 10 November statement, Tata Sons had pointed out that with the exception of TCS, all 40 other firms (many non-dividend paying) in its portfolio paid dividends that have continuously declined from Rs1,000 crore in 2012-13 to Rs780 crore in 2015-16.It said even the Rs780-crore figure included an interim dividend of Rs100 crore, which would have been normally received in 2016-17. Shriram Subramanian, managing director at InGovern Reearch, a proxy advisory firm, says while Chandrasekarans capabilities are beyond doubt, he needs to ensure that better corporate governance practices prevail in the group, and he is not seen as a yes man to Ratan Tata.Also read: Chandras true test will be shutting down Tatas loss-making businesses: Aswath DamodaranIn TCS at least, Chandrasekaran has proven to be his own man as can be seen from the 2008 reorganization of the software firm into five groups, whose directors began reporting directly to him.But the challenges will be different now, when it comes to dealing with other group CEOs, many of them his peers.To some extent, Chandra will also be constrained by not having the experience of having dealt with huge debt and with bankers, said Subramanian.TCS has been the cash cow of Tata group. It accounts for around 17.5% of the total revenue of the conglomerate. It is the company which spews cash to fund Tata ventures into newer businesses, allowing Tata Sons to act like a private equity investor.Chandrasekarans role so far has been to keep it running smoothly and build on the gains made previously; under him, TCSs market capitalization and revenues grew more than three times. But now, he needs to figure out ways to replicate his success with TCS in unfamiliar businesses.The culture in the IT (information technology) industry is one of youthful exuberance, service orientation, technological innovation and collaborative learningan antithesis to the rough and tough shop-floor realities of old-world industries, wrote Prabal Basu Roy, a Sloan Fellow from the London Business School and a chartered accountant, in a column on 14 January. Therefore, this cultural and skill set mismatch will be a major challengethough charismatic leadership can overcome some of this.But such concerns are brushed aside by Tata insiders.Also read: The many challenges of Natarajan ChandrasekaranIf the group chairman knows everything, it will create over dependence and everyone would look upon him rather than doing it on their own, said K. Santhanakrishnan, non-executive and non-independent director at Tata Global Beverages Ltd. The group needs his soft skills. The hardware already exists in the form of professionally managed boards and professional executive management. His experience in the software industry which has linkages with all the sectors and his wide international exposure and acceptability across, would really help the group.Chandrasekaran takes charge at a time when the group needs a strategic reorientation. With the election of Donald Trump, who has vowed to protect American jobs, as US President and the shift in customers spending patterns from traditional IT services to a digital domain, TCS itself is going to face tough times and may not be able to sustain its dividend track record.At the same time, tough calls have to be made to bring down group debt, which stands at Rs2.25 trillion, and which new businesses to focus on.The reactions I get to my philosophy are heartwarming. No less than a thousand employees responded to my call to run the Mumbai Marathon together, Chandrasekaran said in the Runners World interview.To succeed in his new job and successfully complete the metaphorical marathon he is embarking on, he will need a similar response from the 660,000 employees of Tata group.",2017-01-20,PUT0dMs7Buh2WJTdbafJzM,MintAsia examines the challenges Natarajan Chandrasekaran faces  as he prepares to take the helm at Tata Sons at a time when the group is engaged in an ugly feud with its ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry,01:26,Marathon Man

0.35,"Mumbai: Cyrus Mistry, the ousted chairman of Tata Sons Ltd,  formally talked about defining the relationships between Tata group trusts and operating company boards at a June meeting of the holding companys nomination and remuneration committee, said two people close to Mistry. 
				   
				Mistrys team had prepared a governance report on issues related to the group structure, the two said, declining to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the issue. Mistry was removed before he had an opportunity to present these issues at the 24 October board meeting of Tata Sons. Tata trusts have all the rights through representation on the holding companys board to ensure that the flow of dividends for them is steady and that the company is not taking undue risks. However, the governance document sought to clarify the role of each entity and ensure that the promoters exercised their rights through their nominee directors, the two said. The root cause of the current conflict in the Tata group is the groups operating structure itself, proxy advisory firm Institutional Investors Advisory Services said in a 12 November note. Tata trusts exert control over Tata Sons, which exerts control over operating companies, several of which are publicly traded and subject to scrutiny by external stakeholders including shareholders, the note said.ALSO READ | Cyrus Mistry rebuts Tatas takeover bid claimThe governance document, the two people cited above said, is important in view of the events that culminated in the boardroom coup.

This bypassed the Tata Sons boards nomination and remuneration committee, and while it is within the law, it constitutes bad governance, these persons said. In the 25 August shareholder meeting, Tata Sons, with two-thirds ownership, confirmed the appointment of Piramal and Srinivasan. Because Tata trusts have the powers to nominate one-third of the board, Amit Chandra was appointed as a director the next day.ALSO READ | Will do whatever it takes to deal with Cyrus Mistry ouster: Tata SonsWe have said whatever we had to say in the 10 November statement, said a Tata group spokesperson.

				While the EGMs, to some extent, will end the indecisiveness facing the listed entities, its unlikely to bring the curtain down any time soon on one of the biggest corporate feuds seen in the recent past. If anything its going to be protracted battle with both sides likely to seek legal recourse and seeking intervention from market regulator and the government.Here is a quick analysis of the possible scenarios that are likely to emerge:If Tata Sons wins...Mistry gets removed as the director from the boards of various companies. He will also cease to be the chairman at firms where he continues to hold the position. Tata has ousted Mistry as chairman of Tata Consultancy Services, Tata Global Beverages Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd. He continues to be the chairman of Tata Motors Ltd, Tata Chemicals Ltd, Tata Power Co. Ltd and Indian Hotel and Co Ltd. However, Mistrys ejection from the board of Tata companies may not warrant peace to Tatas, said legal experts. Being a shareholder (18.5%) in Tata Sons he can continue to fight. Even if he is ousted, he has the right to arouse his grievances as he has been in the management and is also a shareholder, said a corporate lawyer who declined to be identified.

Tata Sons will have no option left but to take the legal recourse to remove him from the board of companies. Such a scenario may lead to a divided board which is not in the interest of the larger stakeholders of the company, said Kavil Ramachandran, executive director, Thomas Schmidheiny Centre for Family Enterprise, Indian School of Business. A divided board is not good for any organization, he said pointing out that it will also have an adverse impact on the plans and decisions taken by the board.

While IiAss Tandon believes the current crisis is an opportunity for the group to fix its structural issues not every one agrees.

				The oil ministry has also sought their views on the measures that could be taken to ensure that production of gas does not decline further from RILs KG D6 block so that any move to recover the compensation from the sales revenue of gas from the KG DWN 98/3 (KG D6) block does not suffer, a person with direct knowledge of the development said on condition of anonymity. RIL reported production of 139.1 billion cubic feet of gas from the block in 2015-16.An email sent to RIL on Tuesday remained unanswered at the time of going to press.The person quoted above said that the government was merely addressing all aspects of the dispute as per the law and was not being vengeful to an investor. We are only taking steps to protect governments revenue interest in an objective manner as any government of the day will do in any given dispute. The provisions of the law will take its course, said the person.After the oil ministry raised the compensation claim on 4 November, Reliance proposed an arbitration to resolve the issue. Accordingly, the government nominated G.S. Singhvi, a former Supreme Court judge and former Competition Appellate Tribunal (Compat) chairman, as its arbitrator, Mint reported on 26 December. Singhvi, along with RILs nominee on the arbitration panel, Bernard Eder, a former high court judge in the UK, are now in the process of finalizing a third neutral umpire arbitrator for the panel.The ministry raised the compensation demand after the Justice A.P. Shah panel, which looked into ONGCs claim of gas flow between the neighbouring fields of the two companies, recommended on 31 August that RIL should compensate for the unfair enrichment it had by way of retaining the gains of gas flow into its block KG D6. The panel was appointed after the Delhi high court, on a petition from ONGC, asked the government to resolve the issue in a transparent way, keeping in mind provisions of the law and applying principles of natural justice.The panel, which lacked technical expertise on determining whether gas flowed from ONGCs block to RILs, relied upon a report by consultant DeGolyer and MacNaughton, jointly hired by the companies, to say that between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2015, about 11 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas migrated to KG D6 from adjacent fields, of which RIL benefited from 8.9 bcm. RIL in a 4 November statement said that its liability to pay compensation had not been established by any process known to law. The claim of the government is based on misreading and misinterpretation of key elements of the production sharing contract and is without precedent in the oil and gas industry, anywhere in the world RIL remains convinced of being able to fully justify and vindicate its position that the governments claim is not sustainable, the company had said then. Experts said disputes often arise on account of volatility in the energy sector as well as from multiple interpretations of the contract.The government has to ensure that investors get a reasonable return on their investments in the oil and gas sector compared to what they would get from other markets or from other industries. The interests of the government which owns natural resources on behalf of the people and that of investors who help the state commercialize and realise the value of it have to be balanced, said Kalpana Jain, senior director, Deloitte in India.",2017-01-12,RJocZh6y5YMoC2Ok1uOaCP,Oil ministry is seeking opinion on whether it should proceed to recover the $1.55 billion fine in the Reliance-ONGC row while an arbitration remains pending,03:18,"Reliance, govt headed for a long battle in KG D6 dispute"

(ONGC), it could sell surplus crude oil only to government and its nominees.The terms of the PSC allowed Cairn get 70% of crude from the well while the state-owned company would get 30%. The plea is bereft of merits, stands dismissed, said Justice Manmohan who pronounced the order.He added that company could resort to dispute resolution mechanism under the PSC to address the issue of export of surplus crude.The oil and gas exploration company through the hearings had maintained that it should be allowed to export its surplus crude as private domestic refineries in India were not offering competitive prices with respect to the international market.It said that they were agreeable to offering the domestic players in the country the first option to buy the crude, but at international prices.Due to neither the government, nor its nominees or public sector refineries willing to purchase its crude, Cairn contended that it was forced to sell to two private refineriesReliance and Essar, at a loss since these prices were not internationally competitive.The Centre had reiterated that the countrys no-export policy on crude as long as the country does not attain self sufficiency could not be changed.Additional Solicitor General, Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre told the court crude oil per se was not allowed to be exported. He said that India had a total refining capacity of 223 million tonnes. However, at present only 38 million tonnes of crude oil was available.

				According to a person familiar with the development, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the government on 12 October received a favourable order on two issues relating to its share of revenue from the fields.The panel ordered that marketing margin levied by the companies from customers have to be included in the revenue to be shared with the government and that only the actual taxes paid by the contractors can be allowed as a cost and not any notional tax rate mentioned in the contract signed in 1994. In the 1994-95 financial year, corporate tax rate ranged between 45% and 65% depending on tax residence (domestic or foreign) and public interest in the company, compared to 30% at present without surcharge.On a third aspect, the government received mostly a favourable order with an option for companies to file appeals before the tribunal within a month. Based on the two orders that are final with no option for appeals, the oil ministry will calculate the dues and issue notice without waiting any further, said the person. The dues are yet to be calculated.The companies maintained that the order was only partial and that they still have a window to fight the case.Even after the panel decides on every aspect of the dispute, dissatisfied parties are free to approach English courts for further relief.The arbitration was filed by Reliance and British Gas Exploration and Production India Ltd, while ONGC did not participate.

0.03,"New Delhi/Singapore: India may turn into a net importer of fuel oil as its state-owned refiners are making multi-billion dollar investments to upgrade their refineries and produce more profitable refined products such as gasoline or diesel.
				   
				India has traditionally been a net exporter of fuel oil, the residue oil left after initial crude refining that is typically used in shipping and power generation. That is about to change. Three state-run energy firms  Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum  plan to spend $20 billion on refinery expansions to add units by 2022 that would process fuel oil into gasoline and diesel, boosting their output to meet growing local demand for transport fuels.Our fuel oil production will be less because everywhere we are going for residue upgrades, said B. Ashok, chairman of the countrys biggest refiner Indian Oil Corp (IOC).Private refiners Reliance Industries and Essar Oil have already invested heavily to build advanced refineries which produce gasoline at the expense of fuel oil.With state refiners now doing the same, India will soon have to sharply raise imports of fuel oil, two traders that participate in the market said. Indias net fuel oil exports averaged 109,000 tonnes from April to September, according to the countrys Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell, and the traders estimate this could flip into a need to raise fuel oil imports as early as late 2017.As a result, the price difference between diesel and fuel oil could narrow further from its current $17.61 a barrel, as Indian shipping fuel demand rises with the governments thrust on the coastal movement of cargoes, considered more cost efficient than road transport.Already, gasoil and fuel oil differentials have started shrinking from about $30 three years ago to $16-$18 now and it is likely to narrow further as refiners are destroying fuel oil to produce gasoil and gasoline, said S. Thangapandian, director at Gulf Petrochem.Indian refiners expansion plans almost coincide with changing shipping fuel norms from 2020 requiring the use of low-sulphur fuels.IOC is the biggest expansion investor, planning to spend Rs50,000 crore ($7.48 billion) by 2022 to raise its refining capacity by about 30% to 2.08 million barrels per day (bpd) including expanding its Panipat refinery in northern India to about 400,000 to 500,000 bpd.HPCL and BPCL plan to spend $11.25 billion to expand refineries and install fuel oil upgrading units, halting fuel oil output in almost all plants.

0.34,"Sanjay Sagar, joint managing director and chief executive at JSW Energy Ltd, says in an interview that the company has no plans to enter the renewable energy sector in the foreseeable future. Every developed nation in the world has developed on the basis of thermal power so its unfair for them to expect that India should try and develop on the basis of green power, he said. Edited excerpts:
				   
				Would JSW Energy look at entering the renewable energy sector?
We are a country where essentially a lot of our population is poor and cant pay for expensive solar power. So, our only choice in at least the foreseeable future of 30-50 years is thermal power. It sounds very nice to be talking about wind power and ills of thermal coal, but you have to take a holistic view. The Western world, which is today suddenly so conscious about the ills of thermal coal, each of those countries has developed on the basis of thermal power. So, for us to start thinking that we will grow on the basis of solar (energy) I dont think is fair. Now, when I talk to you about growth in this sector, I am talking on the basis of this belief that this latent demand. Then we have to put up generation capacity and for PPAs (power purchase agreements) have to come. The second thing is if you look at the history of the distribution sector, for a long time, it has been owned by the government and continues to be owned by the government except for a few pockets where privatization has taken place. If you look at the history, every 8 to 10 years, discoms run themselves to the ground and the government comes out with a package to revive them. Now, the package is becoming tougher and tougher. With UDAY (Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana) starting to fall in place in another six months and once the discoms fiscal health is improved, they all need power. Its not that they dont want power; its just that they dont have the financial muscle to buy power. The moment their balance sheets are cleaned up, they (will) start buying power. In fact, I am looking at a scenario in India that by 2019 we might run into shortage of power. Its not because people cant consume it but because discoms cant buy power. This will lead to a situation where people with deep pockets or those who have done things prudently in the past can survive.Do you find tariffs in solar sector to be unattractive?
We had the option of tying Rs1.5-2 PPAs also three-four years back. But we consciously kept out of that rat race and so we did not get into a mess. Similarly, we had the option of going in bidding ridiculous premiums on coal blocks. But we believed that process was flawed from day one. And even now, a lot of people are asking me why dont you bid in solar. Because I again believe we are in a similar situation that we were in as far as thermal is concerned when people signed unviable PPAs. Today, they are doing the same thing in solar. Current tariffs in solar are not viable. They are not viable by any stretch of imagination, despite falling module prices. As long as there is a component of foreign and unhedged currency, these prices are not viable. The prices are viable if you dont take the hedging or currency risk into consideration. But you cant do that; youre entering into a 25-year PPA. What youre actually doing here is playing the currency game. It has nothing to do with generation of power.Given government is putting so much stress on solar energy, there might be more incentives for power companies...
When solar prices were Rs13-14 per unit, even at that stage, JSW Energy had kept out. We kept out because at that stage there was a huge element of subsidy built into the tariffs. We as a company believe that any business model which is trying to base its viability on subsidies is a non-starter. Because there is a limit to the amount of subsidy the government can give. We are a country which is plagued by subsidies; our power sector is plagued by subsidies. And for some strange reason, we sort of believed that the people in this nation need subsidy. I dont really believe that the consumer in this country needs subsidized power or even wants subsidized power. The same consumer is paying for his mobile phone; the poorest of the poor today are carrying mobile phones. Why should we presume that for power they are going to ask for subsidies? Why do we continue to believe that the farmer or the rural consumer or urban consumer wants subsidized power? Give him 24x7 power and he will pay for it.So you are saying you see no merit in entering the renewable power sector? Not even in the next five years?
No, not if things continue in the manner that they are. Unless there is a drastic change or we are certain of the viability of the tariffs that are there in the bids. The second issue is that most of these bidsthe low bids that we have seen these are based on Chinese equipment. It is known that the efficiency of solar modules goes down year-on-year. The Chinese equipment is still to be proved; at what rate will it deteriorate? Suppose after 10 years it goes kaput, then you are sunk and then you have to make the whole investment again.So it is just not economies of scale which is leading to a price drop?
No, it is not economies of scale. To the best of my knowledge, a huge amount of manufacturing capacity in China has been shut down. So, it is no longer economies of scale. In fact, Japan today is going back to thermal.Given the concern for the environment, what happens if there are punitive taxes on thermal energy?
Even if there are, they will be counterproductive. For practical reasons itself, you cannot wish thermal away. If it becomes punitive, then the consumer has to pay. I dont think it is a very viable proposition just to boost up solar to make the consumer pay higher price for thermal power. On the face of it, it appears to be counterproductive. When you are sitting in a country which is consuming one-third of the world average, we should be encouraging consumption of electricity. About the environment cess, I was just doing a back-of-the-envelope calculation the other day. The price of Coal India Ltd coal, because of the cess and taxes, has gone up by 53% on an ex-mine basis since May 2014. So, in over two years, the ex-mine price of Coal India coal has gone up 53% for the grade generally used by thermal power. So, those cesses and taxes are already being introduced. There is a cess of Rs400 per tonne of coal. Today, solar can become successful only if they come out with an economically viable solution for storage of power, which does not appear to be coming in near future. We need a solution which on a mass scale can store solar power. Then, you also have to look at space constraints. Today, every state wants a solar plant. You require 4.5-5 acres for setting up one megawatt (MW) of solar capacity, and for thermal, you require less than one acre per MW. Will you get that kind of space? Just think of putting up a 100,000MW solar plant, youre looking at 500,000 acres of land. These are practical problems. Every developed nation in the world has developed on the basis of thermal power, so its unfair for them to expect that India should try and develop on the basis of green power.",2016-09-27,StM6yVZMKG1xpvKppCQayL,"JSW Energy has no plans to enter the renewable energy sector in the foreseeable future, says joint managing director and CEO Sanjay Sagar

				The lack of progress on implementing production quotas and the growing discord between Opec producers suggests a declining probability of reaching a deal on 30 November, Goldman analysts including Damien Courvalin wrote in a note dated 31 October.Opec is due to meet in Vienna to implement the first supply cuts in eight years and get other producers from outside of the group to join in the action, including Russia. Brent crude extended losses below $50 a barrel on Monday after weekend talks failed to yield concrete details on an accord to reduce the global crude surplus and stabilize prices.The lack of an agreement so far has pushed oil prices sharply lower, with weakening oil fundamentals warranting oil prices in the low $40s a barrel in our view if Opec is unable to deliver a convincing agreement, the Goldman analysts wrote.Even if the fear of slumping oil prices prompts the group to hammer out an accord, the probability of the deal successfully reducing inventories is low, the bank said. Rising October Opec production and a faster ramp up of new non-Opec projects have reduced the odds that an agreement translates into a decent draw in inventories during the first half of 2017, it said, estimating average Opec output at about 34.2 million barrels a day last month.While the probability of a cut being announced and the odds of it successfully reducing stockpiles have declined over the past week in Goldmans view, Opecs most senior official said the organization and other major oil producers are on course to deliver a deal that will temper the global oversupply.Committed membersAll of Opecs 14 members as well as erstwhile rivals such as Russia are committed to finalizing the agreement, Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo said on Monday in a Bloomberg Television interview.

The Kingdom cut oil output in January by at least 486,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 10.058 million bpd, fully implementing an agreement by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and other producers to curb a global supply glut.State oil giant Saudi Aramco has started talks with customers globally on possible cuts of 3% to 7% in February crude loadings. There are also reports of supply cuts from Abu Dhabi.Still, doubts remained that all producers would fully implement planned reductions. There will be some countries who will cheat...we expect zero compliance from Baghdad...

Cement volumes in India increased by a meagre 3.3% in the September quarter, according to the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP).While south-based cement makers scored on the volumes front, north-based companies saw better operating profits, aided by a higher price realization.

Though most cement companies didnt see power and fuel costs rising on a y-o-y basis in the September quarter, benefiting from inventory acquired at lower cost, their input costs rose sequentially. And the full impact of rising petcoke prices will reflect in balance sheets from the December quarter onwards, hurting margins, caution analysts. It is known that production cost is likely to move northwards from hereon; what still remains to be seen is how severe will be the impact of demonetisation on cement volumes, although the managements of cement companies dont expect much impact as yet. Most cement stocks have seen sharp corrections after the currency exchange decision was announced on 8 November since it is seen as a near-term negative for the sector.Demand from the rural areas is likely to take a hit since most transactions happen in cash. Urban demand, which was already sluggish, is likely to remain so for some more time. The much-awaited demand revival which had earlier (pre-demonetisation) been foreseen in the second half of the year, would now be further delayed.In this gloom, one bright spot could be the governments spending on infrastructure activities, which may support cement demand to a certain extent.

But with petrochemical prices coming down, one will have to see whether the segments profit improves meaningfully.For the December quarter, the loss before interest and tax for the petrochemicals business dropped to Rs.161 crore from Rs.237 crore seen in the September quarter. The performance could have been better if it were not for stabilization issues faced at the new petrochemicals plant. As Jefferies Equity Research notes, given management commentary that GAIL almost entirely used spot LNG in the third quarter versus mainly RasGas in the second quarter (which was costlier), earnings improvement in petrochemicals was below par.Nevertheless, GAILs overall results did beat expectations. Its gas trading business exceeded expectations, reporting earnings before interest and tax of Rs.483 crore against Rs.51 crore for the year-ago period and Rs.193 crore in the September quarter. Gas pooling for the power sector fetched additional trading volumes sequentially. The companys transmission business too performed well.The upshot: net profit increased 10% year-on-year to Rs.664 crore despite a 10% decline in revenues. Strong other income growth helped.What next? Gas volumes can go up once the increased LNG supplies from RasGas start and once power pooling is implemented in certain states like Andhra Pradesh (still pending due to taxation issues), point out JM Financial analysts.Currently, GAIL trades at 12.5 times estimated earnings for the next fiscal year. Given the rally in the stock over the last three months, most catalysts such as higher crude oil price, positive impact of lower gas price, transmission tariff revision and pickup in transmission volumes seem to be priced in, says Jefferies.",2016-02-11,TOaV2AA7rLEW2O5JR6mVFJ,"Investors will require more than one good quarter from GAIL to alter their view on the stock

0.25,"New Delhi: Director general of hydrocarbons Atanu Chakraborty is presiding over the transition to a new regulatory regime for Indias hydrocarbon pursuits aimed at wooing investors with liberal terms when the global oil and gas industry is sailing through a painful phase of low prices. 
				   
				In an interview, Chakraborty said steps will be taken to reduce disputes in the sector and to make the terms for producing unconventional and difficult to extract fuels as investor-friendly as possible. Edited excerpts:Will India be able to cut import dependence on oil and gas by 10% as planned, considering cooking gas consumption and its import is rising?The Ujjwala programme (of distributing LPG without upfront payment to the poor) is part of a shift towards using cleaner fuel and improvement in the quality of life, which is bound to happen. The demand for fuel on account of this has been captured in the consumption growth of fossil fuels. We have to produce that much extra over and above what can be produced on a business as usual scenario. We are looking at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 5.6%. Year on year growth has been almost 11% in 2014-15. The planned 10% reduction in import dependence by 2022 is called for to make us reasonably strategically secure. To achieve that, we need to increase acreage (under exploration and production). We have launched the auction of the discovered small fields this year, after a gap of about six years. In the last two years, fuel price volatility was a reason not to go ahead with the offer of blocks. The blocks currently on offer are relatively small and have many hydrocarbon discoveries so that investors do not have to spend a lot on exploration. There are other incentives too (such as pricing and marketing freedom and duty free import of equipment). The idea is to incentivize investments and to add to overall production. Having more players in the market will increase competition and efficiency in the industry.With global energy firms now cutting back on their investments, the auction of small discovered fields is going to be a test of their appetite for further investments, isnt it?Under the new hydrocarbon exploration licensing policy (HELP), pricing and marketing freedom is given to gas produced from deep-water, high pressure and high temperature areas. Also, the new royalty structure favours investors. Under the revenue share regime, which replaces profit sharing prescribed in the earlier licensing policy, governments share remains the same (as a percentage of revenue), which gives investors the comfort and incentive to produce more and benefit more in absolute terms. With stable policies, robust economic growth and improvement of our ranking in ease of doing business, the country risk for energy firms is very low. We have to leverage it to get investments and then hold their hands to ensure that they get access to market quickly. We have also ensured that they get the processing facilities of ONGC and Oil India Ltd on a commercial basis. There is no gas utilization policy, the entire market for gas is open to producers. People do talk about other incentives in the case of shale gas. Perhaps we will again revisit the regime to see what more can be offered for production of tight oil and shale gas. We need to tap all these resources simultaneously. Increasing productivity and acreage under exploration and getting to difficult reservoirs is broadly the contours of the strategy. Auction of the small discovered field is the first step. The response to the roadshows has been tremendous. As we learn from the process, if we need to tweak our offering, we certainly will do it in a transparent way. Nothing is cast in stone.What is the strategy on unconventional fuels like gas hydrates and shale gas?In the east coast, we are working together with Japan and the US Geological Survey to extract gas from gas hydrates. It is still at a research stage and we have to reach a stage where the molecules are stable. While tight oil and shale gas are within the realm of possibility, gas hydrate has to reach a stage when we can think of commercial production. Considering our reliance on import, we need to be there on all these emerging areas from day one so that we can monetize any upside at the earliest. The gas market in India is rapidly developing with new transmission lines coming up, including for city gas distribution and for fertilizer plants. The share of gas in the national hydrocarbon basket is expected to go up from about 7% now to 25% in some years. In the case of Gujarat, it is already 25%.What are the tax breaks available for gas producers?Income-tax exemption no longer exists for gas, but import of equipment enjoys customs duty exemption.Price volatility in a highly capital intensive and risky sector such as energy, could in no time bankrupt a successful company. Disputes in such a scenario is normal as we have seen in the past. How do you plan to address this?There would be differences in perception, and hence disputes, in big contracts such as those for natural resources. We have to continuously fine tune the resolution mechanisms. We have made many corrections in the production sharing regime and we keep improving the existing system. If the contractor wants to produce hydrocarbons, the government will always help them. Those who are well intentioned, will always do well. We have a large number of fields which have in the last 20 years added to our energy basket. As a regulator, we want every energy company to bring investments and produce more. We will be taking many steps to further improve regulations.What are the specific areas you would be working on to reduce disputes?Communicating right at the time of auctioning the fields, the different aspects of executing the contract and the issues where perceptions could differ between parties, can eliminate avoidable disputes. We keep examining the models elsewhere that could help in reducing the time required for dispute resolution. For example, invoking force majeure provisions in a contract is one area around which many disputes take place. Creating awareness about this among investors is important. A lot of education is required on contract management by the parties. In the road shows for the discovered small fields, we tried to educate businesses about these aspects. We are also thinking of having a portal to facilitate communication among stakeholders that will help in reducing disputes.",2016-10-13,TbkBDUN0P9dE8WGxSKoC0N,"Steps will be taken to reduce disputes in the energy sector, says director general of hydrocarbons Atanu Chakraborty ",01:41,The entire gas market is open to producers: Atanu Chakraborty

				Rising oil prices through December encouraged investors to buy large volumes of crude oil futures contracts and many of these long positions are likely to be unwound unless the market stays strong, analysts and brokers say.I see this as a dead cat bounce, said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank in Copenhagen. Oil is unlikely to recover until the longs have been reduced.Tamas Varga, analyst at London broker PVM, agreed. We are seeing some short covering on the back of a weaker dollar, Varga said. We might see stronger prices today after yesterdays big fall, but the market should weaken in coming days. I believe we are going lower.Oil is priced in dollars, so a weaker dollar tends to encourage buying by consumers holding other currencies. Brent crude was up 20 cents a barrel at $55.14 by 3.20pm. US light crude oil was up 25 cents at $52.21.Both crude contracts fell more than $2 a barrel, or around 4%, on Monday on doubts that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and other key oil producers would cut output as promised to try to reduce a global oversupply.Opec members Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi both appear to be reducing production but it is not clear whether other big producers such as Iraq will follow suit.

				On Monday night, Cyrus Mistryunceremoniously dumped as group chairman two months agoended his high-decibel bid to hang around at operating companies that had called shareholder meetings to oust him.But Mistrys resignation from those boards is perhaps only a recognition that he was going to lose the proxy fight. Ratan Tata, who engineered the coup against Mistry at holding company Tata Sons Ltd, wont be resting easy. The founding familys tenuous control of the $103 billion conglomerate cant be taken for granted.With Mistry promising to shift the battleground, a far messier skirmish lies ahead. The risk is no longer of a split in the empire; now, just by being patient and uncompromising, Mistry could in theory get all of it.The ousted chairman says he will take the fight to a platform that can uphold the rule of law. Courts, however, are unlikely to get involved in deciding whether Ratan Tata kept meddling in the operating companies after handing over the reins four years ago.Also read: The options before Cyrus MistrySimilarly, Mistrys insinuations of insider trading might baffle the securities regulator. It would be one thing to show that trustees of Tata Trusts, philanthropic institutions that control two-thirds of Tata Sons, asked and got unpublished, price-sensitive information about publicly listed units, but quite another to prove that any of them enriched themselves or others.Alleged financial fraud and violation of foreign-exchange laws at Tata Groups joint-venture airline with Malaysias AirAsia Bhd might pose a more serious challenge, and even ethical lapses that arent necessarily crimes would serve their purpose. If the fog is thick enough to keep the conglomerate on front pages of newspapers for all the wrong reasons, an irritated government might be forced to intervene in Tata Trusts on the grounds that they have gone astray from their charitable mission.Assume Ratan Tata is no longer able to control Tata Trusts. Then, as the second-largest investor in Tata SonsMistrys family owns more than 18%the deposed leader gets to shape the groups destiny.It wont be that easy. If Ratan Tata, whos back as interim chairman of the holding company, can quickly find a strong successor to look after the empire, he can regain his footing. That would allow him to broach a compromise from a position of strength. Theres already a proposal to list Tata Sons. Citigroup Inc. drew up a detailed plan some time back. Implementing it would unlock value for Mistrys shareholding, too.Whether the deal works depends on Mistrys risk preference: The longer he drags on the conflict, the more the loss of wealth for all shareholders, including himself. But Mistry, 48, has one advantage over his 78-year-old-adversary: time.The onus to settle the feud is on Ratan Tata, and the younger man must know that, too.

0.25,"London: Some of the worlds biggest oil companies will invest $1 billion over the next 10 years to develop technologies to capture and store emissions of greenhouse gases and improve energy efficiency.
				   
				The investment, announced in a joint statement on Friday from companies including Saudi Arabian Oil Co., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA, BP Plc, Eni SpA, Statoil ASA and Repsol SA, aims to deploy low-carbon technologies on a large scale. Those energy producers, which together plan more than $90 billion of capital expenditure this year, are part of the oil and gas climate initiative, which is seeking ways the industry can support a global deal to tackle climate change while continuing to produce their hydrocarbon reserves.The creation of OGCI climate investments shows our collective determination to deliver technology on a large scale that will create a step change to help tackle the climate challenge, according to the statement. By working with others our companies play a key role in reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases.The investment comes as last years Paris climate accord enters into force, and three days before delegates from almost 200 countries gather in Marrakesh, Morocco for the latest round of talks to flesh out the deal. The companies, which together account for about a fifth of the worlds oil and gas output, last year backed policies consistent with limiting the increase in average global temperatures to within 2 degrees celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).Not enoughWe have got to welcome any positive move like this particularly, from the oil and gas industry, said Anthony Hobley, chief executive officer of the Carbon Tracker Initiative, a London-based group that studies the effects of climate change and policy on capital markets. $1 billion is not enough and it should be spent on clean energy and not squandered on carbon capture, he said.To give the world a 50% chance of limiting the temperature increase to below 2 degrees Celsius, about one third of oil reserves, half of natural gas and 80 of coal must remain unburnt, according to the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, a London-based researcher.The world needs to focus on ways to capture greenhouse gas emissions, not think about keeping oil in the ground, former Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali Al-Naimi said at an event in London Friday. Theres absolutely nothing wrong with fossil fuels and since the Paris climate agreement the kingdom, which has about 260 billion barrels of oil reserves, is focusing on ways to capture emissions, he said.Carbon captureThe OGCI said it has identified two initial focus areas: accelerating the deployment of carbon capture and storage and reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, which also warm the planet.The group, which was formed in 2014, also includes China National Petroleum Corp., Petroleos Mexicanos and Indias Reliance Industries Ltd. They have reduced greenhouse gas emissions from their own operations by 20% since 2005, according to the initiatives website. No US-based companies are part of the group.Even after the Paris climate deal agreed last year, the world still remains on track for as much as 3.4 degrees of warming by the end of the decade, according to the United Nations. Countries must make further pledges to cut at least 12 gigatons of carbon dioxide in order to meet the Paris goals, it said in a report on Thursday.

0.35,"Ahmedabad: Essar Ports Ltd, one of the leading port companies in the country, is exploring the option of setting up a greenfield commercial port in Gujarat, according to three officials close to the development. 
				   
				The company has recently given a project proposal to the states maritime regulator Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB) for the same. If it materializes, this would be the companys first all commercial port in the country. Currently, the company operates five ports, all of which are largely for captive purpose although they handle some amount of third party commercial cargo as well. According to the investment proposal made to GMB, the company has proposed an investment of Rs10,600 crore for the port project and it plans to employ about 1,000 people, according to two of the three officials quoted. The company aims to develop a commercial multi-purpose port preferably in Devbhoomi Dwarka district with facilities capable of handling bulk, general cargo, liquid including petroleum and oil lubricants, chemicals and LPG.A senior GMB official in the know of the development said that the Essar Ports wants to develop a commercial port with a draft of about 18 metres with a cargo handling capacity of 100 million tonnes per annum (MTPA). Presently, there are only two commercial ports in India that handle a cargo of 100 MTPA or more including the Adani group run Mundra port in Kutch and Kandla Port Trust run government port in Kandla, Kutch. Reliance Industries captive port at Sikka near Jamnagar handles close to 125 MMTPA, which is mainly used for its refinery and petrochemical projects at nearby Moti Khavdi. Apart from cargo, Essar Ports has also proposed to set up a 5 MMTPA liquefied LNG import and re-gasification facilities for the proposed project.The state maritime board has already identified locations for greenfield ports like Kacchigadh and Maroli for private development and these would be offered to Essar for their new port. However, since this is not a captive project, as the per the states policy for private ports, the regulator might call for bidding, said the same senior GMB official quoted earlier. Essar officials when contacted refused to comment on the development. It was not immediately clear if Essar Ports and the state government would sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) at the upcoming Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit 2017, where a lot of companies are expected to sign such non-binding pacts. Essar Ports had volumes but it could not get value for commercial cargo due to limitations of a captive port. With their expertise in handling port business, a multi-purpose greenfield port in south Gujarat would be more viable as GMB has already identified few good sites in the region. Also, it has good connectivity to northern hinterland and many industries have also set up there, according to Ramesh Singhal, chief executive, i-Maritime Consultancy, which tracks the port and shipping sector.In October, the Essar group promoters Ruia family signed a deal with Russias Rosneft and partner consortium to sell their 98% stake in Essar Oil. The $12.9 billion deal included the 20 MTPA Vadinar refinery and Vadinar Port in Gujarat. It is likely to close by March. The company had said in a 15 October statement that the deal would help Essar deleverage almost 50% of its Rs88,000 crore debt and substantially reduce interest costs. Essar Ports current has a cargo handling capacity of 140 MMTPA which it plans to expand to 194 MMTPA over the next few years.

				Seven of the worlds largest energy companies will together boost oil and natural gas output by 398,000 barrels a day, the most since 2010, according to data from Oslo-based consultant Rystad Energy AS. In 2018, output will rise even faster.The oil majors arent increasing their drilling budgets. Instead theyre benefiting from money invested before the rout. Lower costs combined with higher output would allow companies including Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc to maximize their gains from improved oil prices. Should crude remain above $50 a barrel, 2017 could be a break-out year, eliminating the need to borrow to pay dividends, according to analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein.They could hit a sweet spot this year, said Mark Tabrett, a London-based analyst at Bernstein. Heavy investments of previous years are paying off with more production, costs have been cut and the companies are in a position to take advantage of that when oil prices rise.After reaching an intraday low of $27.10 a barrel on  20 January, Brent oil prices more than doubled to a high of $57.89 on 12 December. The global benchmark rose 52% last year, its biggest yearly gain since 2009. Shares in the majors, meanwhile, rose across the board, led by Shell, whose B shares gained 53% in London, the best annual increase since at least 1990.Brent averaged about $45 a barrel in 2016, and is expected to rise above $55 this year, according to the median of 45 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Yet the majors, still smarting from more than two years of depressed prices, have expressed a reluctance to increase spending.For us this will be about not starting to run too fast, Statoil chief executive officer Eldar Saetre said at a conference in Oslo last week. There wont be a lot of new activity initiated when it comes to larger projects in 2017.2020 problemRystad estimates that the seven companies will boost output by about 670,000 barrels a day next year. Still, years of under-investment during the time when oil prices were low mean the production gains may be short lived.Output should start declining eventually for the majors that slowed project-sanctioning, said Rob West, an analyst at Redburn (Europe) Ltd, a London-based equity broker. Field-by-field models suggest thats a problem for 2020.Much of the expected increase is coming from offshore oil and gas projects approved at the start of the decade, said Espen Erlingsen, vice-president for analysis at Rystad. Theyre the kind of mammoth projects that are difficult to shut down once they get going.Included is Chevron Corp.s Gorgon liquefied natural gas project in Australia, which partly resumed operations last week, and Kazakhstans Kashagan field, in which Eni SpA, Exxon, Shell, and Total SA all have stakes, which began producing last year. Eni expects oil and gas production to climb to a record in 2017 even as spending continues to fall.A plan by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and 11 other nations to curb their supply and boost prices wont stand in the way of these companies growth plans, Redburns West said.While they all have production in Opec countries, the cuts are mostly concentrated outside of the majors portfolios, or cover assets that were declining anyway, he said.The majors are now starting to harvest from the investments they did at the beginning of this decade, Erlingsen said. Production is expected to grow, while investments are falling. Bloomberg",2017-01-11,USaR7mcuMq4D8T2c9vh7pL,"Seven of the worlds largest energy companies will together boost oil and natural gas output by 398,000 barrels a day, the most since 2010",10:37,Big oil hits sweet spot as new projects reap rewards of recovery
0.43,"Bengaluru: The squabble between rival factions owing allegiance to Cyrus Mistry and Ratan Tata at the Tata group could mask the potentially poor performance of individual companies. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) could be one beneficiary.
				   
				According to BNP Paribas, TCS will report a 6% increase in dollar revenue in the current financial year, down from last years 7%. Even this projection looks a tad generous, and, according to Mint calculations, TCS runs the risk of less than 5.6% growth.Put simply, TCS, for the first time since it clocked 5.4% growth in 2009-10, could add less than $1 billion in incremental revenue this year. And that could ring alarm bells at TCS, which ended with $16.5 billion in revenue in the financial year to March last year.TCS will report its fiscal third quarter earnings on Thursday.Accenture Plc., a firm about twice as large as TCS, recorded 6% growth in the year ended August (Accenture follows a September-August financial year). Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solution Corp., which was about half of TCSs size of $6 billion in 2009when Natarajan Chandrasekaran became the CEO of TCSwill still manage 9% growth to end the year with at least $13.5 billion in revenue (Cognizant follows the calendar year as financial year).At the heart of TCSs underperformance, which started manifesting in July 2014, is its inability to build a stronger consulting practice and the managements reluctance to buy small firms for technologies like design consulting and data analytics and automation platform providers. TCS also faces some client-specific challenges, all of which have led to low growth. Still, over the last two years, this has not stopped TCS management from claiming the company is making itself future-ready. The biggest concern for stakeholders is if TCS will continue to chug along in 2017-18 and disappoint with depressing growth numbers. For now, the signals are not bright. With this as the backdrop, Mint puts the spotlight on five things to watch in TCSs third quarter earnings on 12 January:1. Revenue growth and management commentary on the demand outlookBNP Paribas expects TCSs dollar revenue to inch up 0.3% to $4.39 billion in the October-December period on a sequential basis. Most brokerages do not expect any significant uptick in growth in the current quarter, either. Nonetheless, management commentary on demand for companys services from clients, especially in Europe and US, will be crucial.2. Pressure on profitability Since January last year, TCSs operating margins have been under pressure. Its 26.1% Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin at the end of March quarter was 54 basis points less than margins at the end of October-December period of 2014. The companys margins further contracted to 25.1% at the end of June quarter, and improved to 26% at the end of July-September period. Now, as commoditized deals come under further pricing pressure, traditional levers like going slow on hiring will not be enough to offset the gradual decline in profitability. For this reason, most analysts are doubtful if TCS will be able to operate in the managements stated guidance of 26-28%.3. Performance in the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) and retail sectorsAccentures performance in the September-November period and management commentary suggests some weakness in business from clients in the BFSI sector. This spells trouble for a company like TCS, which generates more than 40% of its business from BFSI. Retail segment too has seen a decline, and for this reason, management commentary on BFSI and retail, which together bring about 54% of its total revenue, will be eyed.4. Impact of US bill seeking to increase pay to employees with H1B visasEarlier this month, a legislation demanding that outsourcing firms pay at least $100,000 a year to employees who work in the US was introduced in the Congress. Analysts and industry executive believe it could take up to a year before the US makes this a law. Washingtons demand that companies like TCS pay a minimum wage of $100,000 to employees with H1B visas could hurt profitability by 300-500 basis points, according to a 9 January note by JPMorgan Chase and Co. analyst Viju George. Management commentary on this will be watched.5. Weak sectors and geographiesTCS does not expect growth to rebound in Japan. The company claims to have arrested any loss of business from its UK-based insurance platform Diligenta. Growth from telecoms segment continue to be wobbly. Together, underperformance by the three units eroded about 2% growth from the companys 11.9% growth on constant currency basis in 2015-16.

Impact on volumes has not been as severe as dreaded. Domestic sales volumes declined 2% at 11.01 million tonnes (mt), lower than analysts estimates. Strong demand in south India helped reduce the intensity of the impact on volumes to a certain extent. Overall sales volumes stood at 11.7 million tonnes, down nearly 1% year-on-year.
				   
				The companys cost-control measures helped bolster the profit and led to better operating efficiency.

				The company also plans to enter the spot LNG market this year, said two officials aware of the development.HPCL has an equal joint venture agreement with Shapoorji Pallonji Port Pvt. Ltd to build the 5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) LNG terminal at Chhara Port. The terminal is expected to be commissioned by 2019. HPCL is in dialogue with at least six parties internationally to source gas for the Chhara LNG terminal that it will complete by 2019.

ALSO READ: Oil marketing firms plan to introduce dynamic pricing at all retail outlets this yearHPCL did not reply to an email questionnaire sent on Tuesday. An HPCL official declined to name the six suppliers citing confidentiality clauses. LNG aggregators and fleet operators such as BP Plc. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc., are among the companies providing access to spot natural gas to interested buyers. Commissioning the terminal will help HPCL source LNG for its own refineries as well as to market natural gas for customers connected through gas pipelines.HPCL, as part of its expansion plan in the LNG segment, is also testing waters to enter the spot market this year. LNG is sold under long-term contracts and spot. Traditionally, the LNG market favoured long-term contracts but since the drop in crude oil and natural gas prices since 2015, spot trades have assumed significance. HPCL may market LNG cargoes of 60,000-70,000 metric tonnes. This, the second of the two persons said, will help the company establish itself in the gas business before it commissions its LNG terminal.According to Bloomberg, spot LNG prices for Singapore as on 3 January stood at $9.062 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) against $8.82 per mBtu.

-0.39,"New Delhi/ Mumbai:  Explorers in the worlds fastest-growing oil market are seeking lower taxes on crude produced from local fields to encourage fresh drilling as India tries to reduce its dependence on energy imports.
				   
				State-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) and the biggest private producer Cairn India Ltd. want finance minister Arun Jaitley to at least halve the cess on crude oil production in the Union budget due 1 February. India surprised some explorers last year with its 20% ad-valorem tax on every ton of crude produced locally, moving from a fixed charge. Companies pay more now with crude near $50 a barrel than they did under the old system when it was double the price.Globally, given the low oil price scenario, governments have provided incentives to stimulate and attract investments, said Sudhir Mathur, interim chief executive officer at Cairn India. In India, the cess rate of 20% acts as a disincentive to increase production and commit incremental investments.Attracting investments to boost output from local fields is key for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has made energy security a priority and set a target of cutting oil imports by 10% in the next five years. Reducing the levy will help explorers including ONGC and Cairn India, which oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan estimates will spend $25 billion by the end of this decade. Indias hydrocarbon resources are highly undeveloped and production has been declining for the past several years, prompting the government to nudge companies to invest in reversing the fall and increase energy supplies.New Delhi-based ONGC is spending over $5 billion for its biggest development plan in a deep-sea block in the Bay of Bengal off the countrys east coast. Cairn India also plans to spend as much as $4 billion over the next few years to drill for oil.Asias third-largest economy meets about 80% of its crude oil requirements through imports.We need some money to be left behind so that we are able to flow back into the investment cycle, said A.K. Srinivasan, finance director at ONGC, the nations biggest explorer.Otherwise there will be cash shortage. Already, we are going to run cash shortages.At a price of $55 a barrel, ONGC may have to pay about $11 as cess, compared with $9 when prices were $100 a barrel and the tax was fixed charge, he said. With crude prices firming up, the cost impact of this tax is quite high.Brent oil prices have risen about 17% since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) agreed in November to cut production for six months starting in January. The fuel traded above $100 as recently as September 2014.Firming crude prices may also allow the government to reduce the levy on retail prices for gasoline and diesel, according to Dhaval Joshi, an analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd.India didnt pass on to consumers the entire benefit of crudes price decline from July 2014, increasing excise duty on the two fuels nine times and mopping up about Rs960 billion ($14 billion) in the previous two fiscal years.The government may now look at easing prices as one way of cushioning the impact of its 8 November ban on high-denomination currency notes, which impacted the rural population the most, as it prepares for five state elections this quarter. The consumer price of diesel, the most-used fuel in the country, is at a record while that of gasoline is at the highest since August 2014, according to state-run fuel retailer Indian Oil Corp.s (IOL) website.

-0.07,"Geneva: Trafigura Groups purchase of 24% of Essar Oil marks a strategic shift as the trading house builds its position in the fast-growing Indian market and deepens ties with Russias Rosneft PJSC.
				   
				Part of a $13 billion deal spearheaded by Russias state-controlled petroleum giant Rosneft, its the largest oil acquisition in the 23-year-old commodity traders history. The transaction is expected to increase market share for Trafigura, the third-largest independent oil trader that already handles more than 4 million barrels a day.Trafigura wont disclose how much it will pay for the 24% interest in the 400,000 barrels-a-day Vadinar refinery and a network of 2,700 Essar Oil service stations. Trafigura will use its own equity plus its stake in the refinery as collateral for bank financing, but said it doesnt plan to tap the bond market.The deal, first reported by Bloomberg News in July, will see Rosneft acquire 49% of Essar Oil as well as a port terminal and power plant that values the entire transaction, including debt, at about $13 billion. Trafigura has formed a special purpose vehicle with Russian private investment fund United Capital Partners called Kesani Enterprises that will hold the investment outside of Trafiguras corporate structure.Strategic positionEssar Oil occupies a strategic position in the global oil market, Trafigura chief executive officer Jeremy Weir, who took over the top job following the death of co-founder and former chairman Claude Dauphin in 2015, said in a statement. It owns world-class refining and infrastructure assets that will create multiple synergies with our trading business.While the record Essar deal, which marks the largest single foreign direct investment in Indian corporate history, will give Rosneft a deep foothold in a market expected to overtake Japan as the third-largest oil user and the fastest growing crude consumer through 2040, it is also expected to boost Trafiguras trading volumes significantly as it fights for market share with rivals Vitol Group, Glencore Plc and Gunvor Group.Also Read: Deal with Rosneft is US sanctions-compliant: Essar CEO Prashant RuiaTrading houses have been investing in physical assets such as mines, ports, terminals and refineries to diversify their operations away from being mere middle-men buying and selling commodities. Vitol, the largest independent trader, owns stakes in refineries with a total capacity of about 390,000 barrels per day. Gunvor, which once dominated the trade of Russian seaborne crude, owns three refineries in Europe with total daily capacity of about 306,000 barrels.Fully compliantIn exchange for its investment, Trafigura is expected to increase its share of crude supplied to the Vadinar complex, which is designed to run on heavy Iranian or Venezuelan crude. Trafigura is also expected to handle more of the products including diesel and gasoline produced at Vadinar, which is Indias second largest refinery.Also Read: Essar Oil sells 98% to Rosneft, Trafigura and UCPTrafigura said that the transaction is fully compliant with international sanctions. The closely held trading house, which is owned by a group of 600 senior employees, has increased business with Rosneft even after the producer and its CEO Igor Sechin were sanctioned by the US in 2014 over Russias role in Ukraine crisis.Using short-term financing arrangements, Trafigura has purchased large volumes of Rosneft crude by complying with sanctions that prohibit lending to the Russian company for periods longer than 30 days.Close relationshipTrafiguras current close relationship with Rosneft began in 2013 when Dauphin and Sechin signed a five-year $1.5 billion prepayment deal in St. Petersburg for the trading house to purchase as much as 10.11 million tons of crude. The deal was far smaller than similar prepay agreements struck with Rosneft by Vitol and and Glencore that same year worth a total of $10 billion.Following record earnings from its oil-trading division in 2015 due to price volatility and a contango market structure that allowed traders to lock in profits by storing oil to be sold later at a higher price, Trafiguras first-half profit fell 10% from a year earlier. Without a one-time gain from a deal in which Angolas government acquired a dormant iron-ore mine, net income would have fallen by 50 percent.The yield on Trafiguras five-year bond due in 2020 widened 10 basis points to 4.42% on Monday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Victoria Dix, a spokeswoman for Trafigura in Geneva, declined to comment further or provide details on the financing structure for the deal.The companys office in Mumbai currently employs about 600 people involved in both metals and oil trading as well as back office and support functions.Trafiguras 49% owned storage and retail business Puma Energy owns two small refineries, including a 20,000 barrel-a-day plant in Nicaragua and a 32,000 barrel-a-day refinery in Papua New Guinea.

				In early 2009, NTT Docomo invested Rs14,500 crore ($2.2 billion) in an Indian wireless business on the understanding that if certain targets werent met in five years, its partner, Mumbai-based Tata Group, would either find a buyer for the Japanese companys 26.5% stake at fair market value, or would take over those shares at half the original value of the investment, whichever was higher. When Docomo decided to exercise the option in April 2014, there was no taker for the unprofitable operations, so the Tatas sought central bank permission to pay out the equivalent of Rs7,250 crore.By then, however, the Reserve Bank of India had a new set of rules that banned any exit by a foreign equity investor at an assured price. Still, the central bank, under Governor Raghuram Rajan, wanted to allow the payment because it was a question of an Indian company honouring an agreement, struck at a time when there was no clear law against options embedded in such an investment. Also, this clearly wasnt a case of foreign-currency debt masquerading as equity. How many creditors agree in advance to a 50% haircut after five years? Yet the Indian government, which had the final say, decided the Tatas shouldnt be allowed to pay Docomo.In January 2015, Docomo took the dispute to the London Court for International Arbitration. Last month, the court awarded the Japanese firm $1.17 billion (Rs7,840 crore at the current rate) in compensation from Tata Sons, the Indian conglomerates holding company.The saga should have ended there, except that:Bloomberg News reports that New Delhi intends to block the arbitration payment, too; Japans Nikkei says Docomo might ask a US court to seize Tata assets; The Financial Times has learned from a person close to Docomo that the Japanese company might seek enforcement action on Tata Groups British businesses; and The Tata Group is countering that the struggling Port Talbot steel plant in south Wales, as well as UK-based Jaguar Land Rover, are owned by Tata Steel and Tata Motors  theyre not Tata Sons properties. So the whole thing has become a spectacle. The Indian governments refusal to take a commonsense view of Docomos claim was a poor decision. New Delhi is now making bad judgment worse by threatening to block the arbitration award.Such actions have consequences. Not only has the governments pigheadedness created unnecessary risks for minority shareholders of publicly traded Tata Steel and Tata Motors, it has also cast doubts on Prime Minister Narendra Modis resolve to change investors experience of doing business in India.

Sales in North America rose 9%, while revenue in international markets grew 2% compared with the prior quarter.With the price of oil rising above $50 a barrel in New York, US drillers increased the number of rigs working in shale fields by 19% in the final three months of 2016. That helped spur a return to profitability for the company that helps explorers map pockets of underground oil, complete the wells and maintain output. Halliburton is expected to swing to a profit of $1.08 a share this year, according the average of 46 analysts estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Halliburton is realizing increased pricing and utilization throughout its US onshore region, analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. wrote Monday in a note to investors.Halliburton cut thousands of workers during a downturn that saw oil fall below $30 a barrel early last year, and has been pressing customers for higher prices in order to return to profitability in North America. Customers in the US and Canada boosted the number of oil and natural gas drilling rigs 19% in the final three months of the year.Despite the positive sentiment surrounding the North American land market, it is important to remember that our world is still a tale of two cycles, chief executive officer David Lesar said in the statement. The North America market appears to have rounded the corner, but the international downward cycle is still playing out.Schlumberger Ltd, the worlds largest oilfield services provider, generates most of its sales outside the US and Canada. On Friday, it reported that fourth-quarter net losses narrowed to $204 million from $1.02 billion a year earlier.

Here is a bit about the case studies: TaisysThe case from Taisys focused on the Sim-Se-pay solution launched by Taisys with Yes Banka wafer-thin sticker which can be stuck on any type of SIM card of any telco service providerstandard, micro and nano. This sticker installs a sim tool kit-based app which can be accessed by the consumer on any mobile phone without the need for Internet connection.This Sim-Se-Pay wafer is linked to a prepaid wallet which can be loaded by the consumer to perform various types of transactions. The case challenged students to work on increasing commercial usages and socio-commercial usages of the SIM Sleeve and create a comprehensive marketing strategy for the same.T-HubThe second case focused on the unique public/private partnership between T-Hub, the government of Telangana, three of Indias premier academic institutes (IIIT-H, ISB and NALSAR) and key private sector leaders. It stands at the intersection of the start-up, academic, corporate, research and government sectors, and Yes Bank.In April 2016, Yes Bank signed a memorandum of understanding  with T-Hub to create a centre of excellence (CoE), to enable the Indian start-ups across segments with primary focus on fintech. This association will help create a conducive business environment and support system for a large number of fintech start-ups. In addition, Yes Bank will offer its various products and payment gateways and open application program interfaces (APIs) to the start-up community. This challenge tasked the worlds finest minds to create an innovation strategy to leverage the relationship between Yes Bank and T-Hub and to create a holistic innovation program for fintech start-ups, as well as to create a detailed marketing strategy and implementation programme to promote the CoE initiative in a cluttered and highly competitive market.Zaggle In case 3, the focus shifted to Zaggle one of Indias fastest growing prepaid card companies with over 1,000 corporates and 600,000 cards (Visa/Master/proprietary platform) in circulation.Yes Bank and Zaggle have entered into an association to offer prepaid cards to Yes Bank customers. Zaggle has aligned itself with Yes Bank as a total solution provider for its prepaid instruments services across India. This collaboration formally marked Zaggles first engagement with Yes Bank to issue prepaid gift cards and subsequently follow it up with other prepaid cards and allied products with respect to digital payments. This collaboration with Yes Bank would enable Zaggle to further cement its position as a leader in the digital payments space.The case challenged the students to device a cashless innovative pre-paid solution for individuals, giving employers a hassle free product construct and the recipient a potent solution with a wide bouquet of options along with a focused marketing strategy.EzetapThere has been much talk about the gradual shift to a cashless society and the fourth case in the Yes Bank Transformation Series focused on that. This case was shared by Ezetapthe fastest growing mPoS company in India today. Since launching in 2011, Ezetap has over 80,000 terminals deployed in the market, processing over $2.5 million in gross transaction value daily.Despite the phenomenal growth of mobile wallet and m-PoS providers in the country, there is a still major reliance on cash transactions (almost 94% transactions are cash-based). Bright young minds across the world were tasked with devising a strategic road map for Ezetap to tap this huge potential market (there is a potential of 19-20 million PoS  terminals in India while currently only around a million exist). Students were also advised to integrate the revolutionary UPIUnified Payment Interface technology.Campus connectAfter a gruelling opening round, the top five teams were identified by senior leaders from the partner organizations and Yes Bank leaders. The Yes Bank Transformation Series hosted campus challenges across the top 25 campuses in the country to identify the 15 finalist teams of the challenge. The campus round saw students ideas being judged on criteria such as research methodology, understanding of current regulatory framework, depth of analysis of core issues, innovation quotient, and feasibility of implementation and scalability.Apart from naming the winners and runners-up in the campus round, additional prizes were given away for the most innovative idea, most implementable solution, best marketing plan, and Y-Star presenter. This year saw a number of online engagements that generated a huge buzz in the student community. For instance, prior to the campus rounds, teams that submitted their entries before 21 August were eligible for the early-bird submission prize. There was also a Cheatcode Day, through which the top five winners got the opportunity to have their queries addressed by the case-study partner.Students were equally ecstatic about the competition and shared their feedback. Said Janaki Thakkar, student at IIM, Ahmedabad: This year, the theme was around Innovation and National Impact, and the case study we received was a live project Yes Bank was working on. This made the competition appealing, knowing that our work would add value to the organization, and hence we decided to participate. Of course, the attractive prizes helped! Since we worked on a live problem statement at Yes Bank Transformation Series, the competition gave us an opportunity to apply our classroom learnings to real world scenarios. Further, this competition helped us in exploring the current trends across various sectors and keep us informed about recent developments in the business world. While working on this case, we not only looked into developing marketing plan for the target group but also multiple use-cases that would add value to the customers. Says Pramod Suresh of ISB Hyderabad: The transformation series was a challenging competition which required the use of both our left and right brains to arrive at creative yet logical solutions to an actual problem. Yes Bank and T-Hubs brand ensured that there would be stiff competition. The competition exposed us to the accelerator and fintech ecosystem. It also pushed us to think on new disruptive business models. We also got a holistic exposure into various facets of business and also helped polish the soft skills.According to Rashmi Yadawad of IIM, Calcutta: A competition like Yes Bank Transformation Series gives me an opportunity to know about this in detail and stay updated with the current industries and trends. Apart from knowing about current industries and trends, direct interactions with officials from Yes Bank and Ezetap gave me insights from their perspective, a direct picture of what they have already tried. Competing with the campus winners across different B-school campuses will also give me more learnings and the fire to give my best!The grand finaleIn a first-of-its-kind collaboration, the ministry of new and renewable energy, Government of India, shared a challenge focusing on popularizing solar energy with the 15 finalist teams. The final case study will provide a gruelling test to Indias future business leaders. After proving their worth in real-life business cases, the finale takes them to uncharted territories as they pit their wits on a challenge of national importance. The final case challenges finalists to provide innovative financial solutions for solar, or photovoltaic, installations while also creating a strategy for solar consumer products.India is now at a juncture when we must turn to solar to power our future. The government is fully committed to boosting generation and use of solar energy and aims to add 1,00GW of solar power by 2022. The non-polluting nature of solar energy further underlines its status as the most preferred fuel. We must look to integrate solar energy with the lives of the common Indian by making it cheaper, more reliable and easier to connect to grid. High quality research, technological advancements and innovative financing solutions are the means to ensure solar energy becomes affordable and accessible to all. In this regard, I am happy to note that the Yes Bank Transformation Series will see teams from top B-schools in India offering innovative and path breaking ideas regarding the future growth of solar as a medium of energy. I look forward to receiving some valuable insights and suggestions from the sharp young brains and wish them all the best, said A.K. Tripathi, adviser, ministry of new and renewable energy.The grand finale will be held in New Delhi on 16 and 17 November, where the finalists will get to present their ideas to a jury comprising industry experts and mentors. To kick off the final proceedings of the case challenge, Yes Bank will conduct a curtain-raiser on 16 November in New Delhi, where the final 15 teams will get the opportunity to fine-tune their solutions with the advisory council. They will also get to hear the success stories of some of Indias most successful start-up founders as they prepare to start their own quest to entrepreneurship.On 17 November, the teams will present their solutions to the jury, who will pick three winning teams that present the most innovative ideas that can create an impact.

0.1,"Mumbai: The board of Tata Sons Ltd on Monday replaced Cyrus P. Mistry as chairman, less than four years after he took the helm, and named his predecessor Ratan Tata interim chairman for four months.
				   
				The board of the group holding company did not specify a reason for the abrupt move, which was announced after markets closed.Tata Sons in its collective wisdom and on the recommendations of the principal shareholders decided that it may be appropriate to consider a change for the long-term interest of Tata Sons and Tata group, a spokesperson said. A selection committee comprising Ratan Tata, Venu Srinivasan, Amit Chandra, Ronen Sen and Kumar Bhattacharyya was given the mandate of finding a replacement for Mistry, 48, who became chairman of the $103 billion conglomerate in December 2012, at the end of Tatas over two-decade tenure at the top. The board was given four months to complete the task. In the interim, the board has requested me to perform the role of chairman and I have agreed to do so in the interest of and reassurance to the Tata group, Ratan Tata, 78, said in a statement addressed to colleagues.ALSO READ | Uneasy lies the Tata crownThe development, which portends at least short-term turmoil, comes at a time when the conglomerate, whose business interests range from tea to telecom and salt to software services, has been trying to recast or dispose of the key UK steel business, which it acquired in a $12.9 billion purchase of Corus Group Plc. in 2007 under Ratan Tata.This is quite an unusual situation, unexpected from a group like Tata which stands for its values. This means there could possibly have been some governance issue or some major disagreement with either the style of functioning or decision that Mistry may have taken, said Kavil Ramachandran, professor and executive director at the Thomas Schmidheiny Centre for Family Enterprise at the Indian School of Business.According to a person aware of the development, the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, of which Mistry is a scion and which is estimated to hold an 18% stake in Tata Sons, is protesting the move, paving the ground for what could be a messy battle. About two-thirds of Tata Sons is held by philanthropic trusts such as the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Mistry will continue as a Tata Sons director, the spokesperson cited earlier said. However, the group executive council (GEC), a brainchild of Mistrys, has been disbanded, said a person aware of the development. The GEC page has been pulled down from Tata Sons website as has Mistrys September interview to the in-house magazine in which he stated his views on some of the underperforming companies in the group. Our individual companies need to earn the right to grow, he said in the interview.The boardroom putsch has been some time in the making, according to a person close to Mistry, who asked not to be identified. Differences have surfaced over how Mistry has been dealing with the significant challenges facing the group.Several of Mistrys operational decisions were challenged by Ratan Tata, according to this person. Still, it is the prerogative of the largest shareholder to do this, the person said a few weeks ago. Mint couldnt ascertain if there was an immediate trigger for this ouster.Primarily, it was a lack of communication between the shareholder and the management. A lot of decision-making was done unilaterally by Tata Sons and was not approved by Tata Trusts, said another person briefed about the matter.Among the six chairmen Tata Sons has had so far in its history, Mistrys is the shortest tenure at just short of four years.ALSO READ | Ratan Tata says intolerance a curse we are seeing of lateSince taking over, Mistry has repeatedly talked about continuing to seize business opportunities, especially in emerging technologies.

				Accordingly, the share of renewable energy in the countrys fuel mix will increase from the present level of 2% to 8% in 2035. However, the green surge will be inadequate to meet Indias growing need for energy with the countrys demand growth expected to be more than double the non-OECD countries average of 52%.OECD countries refer to the 35 nations that are signatories to the Convention on the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, and mostly comprise mature economies.This comes in the backdrop of investors seeing enormous opportunity in Indias emerging green economy. India, the worlds third largest energy consuming economy after the US and China, plans to achieve 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022 as part of its commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted by 195 countries in Paris in December 2015.The global energy landscape is changing. Traditional centers of demand are being overtaken by fast-growing emerging markets. The energy mix is shifting, driven by technological improvements and environmental concerns. More than ever, our industry needs to adapt to meet those changing energy needs, said Bob Dudley, BP group chief executive in a statement.According to the report, an annual feature published by British energy firm BP Plc, the growth in Indias energy demand is expected to outpace the other so-called BRIC (Brazil, Russia, China, India) countries. Indias energy demand is expected to grow by 129%, while China and Brazils energy demand will grow by 47% and 41%, respectively. Russias energy demand is expected to grow by 2%.Indias energy consumption is expected to grow by 4.2% annually, faster than all major economies in the world. As a result, Indias share of global energy demand will increase to 9% by 2035, accounting for the second largest share among the BRIC countries with China at 26%, Russia at 4%, and Brazil at 2%.Coal remains the dominant fuel produced in India with a 65% share of total production in 2035. Renewables overtakes oil as the second largest, increasing from 4% to 14% in 2035 as oil drops from 10% today to 3% by 2035, the report said.In India, which is the biggest greenhouse gas emitter after the US and China, renewable energy currently accounts for 15%, or 45,917 MW, of the total installed capacity of 3,10,005 MW. According to the government, India has a renewable energy potential of around 900 GW from sources such as wind, solar, small hydro and bio energy.The National Democratic Alliance governments focus on renewable energy stems from Indias energy import bill of around $150 billion, expected to reach $300 billion by 2030. India imports around 80% of its crude oil and 18% of its natural gas requirements. The government aims to effect a 10% cut in energy imports by 2022 and a 50% cut by 2030. India imported 202 million tonnes of oil in 2015-16.According to BP Energy Outlooks prediction, Indias oil imports are expected to rise by 165%, followed by a 173% and 105% increase in gas and coal imports respectively. Energy in transport grows by 5.8% per year and oil remains the dominant fuel source with a 93% market share in 2035, the report added.",2017-01-27,WtZZpEdwb01T6g9uAF0nsM,"The clean energy surge will, however, be inadequate to meet Indias growing need for energy with the countrys demand growth",08:58,Renewables to overtake Indias oil output in 2035: BP Energy Outlook 
0.38,"New Delhi: After Tata Group, Indias largest fertiliser producer IFFCO has envisaged interest in taking 10% stake in Rs5,900 crore floating LNG import terminal being set up by Nikhil Merchant-led Swan Energy in Gujarat.
				   
				Earlier this month, Tata Realty and Infrastructure (TRIL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Sons set up in 2007, had expressed interest in taking 10% stake in Swan LNG Pvt. Ltd that is setting up the Floating and Regasification Unit (FSRU) near Jafrabad in Gujarat. In a stock exchange filing, Swan today said: Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Ltd (IFFCO) are willing to invest up to 10% of the equity in the project. Ahead of the move, the authorised share capital of Swan LNG Pvt Ltd has been increased from Rs5 lakh to Rs2,000 crore, Swan Energy said in a separate filing. Gujarat government had previously taken 26% equity the LNG project. The Gujarat government participation in the project was through Gujarat State Petronet Ltd and Gujarat Maritime Board jointly. State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) have already booked 60% of the capacity of 5 million tonnes a year LNG terminal. The three firms have signed an agreement to import 1 million tonnes per annum of their own liquefied natural gas (LNG) at the Swan terminal. Gujarat State Petroleum Corp Ltd (GSPC) too is in talks to take 1.5 million tonnes capacity in the FSRU. The companies hiring the capacity will bring their own LNG from abroad and pay Swan a tolling fee. Swan Energy is building the project in joint venture with Exmar of Belgium, which holds 38% stake in the project. Swan is targeting 2019 for commissioning of the one jetty-moored FSRU at Jafrabad. It plans to expand the capacity to 10 million tonnes through the deployment of a second FSRU. Last month Swan had in a regulatory filing stated that it has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Petronasr and Alpha Energy Ltd for development of 20 trillion cubic feet Sephied Baghun gas field in Iran at an investment of $615 million. The project, besides constructing infrastructure to put the field into production, would also involve building an offshore gas liquefaction facilities (OLNG) that will convert the gas into its liquid form (LNG) for transporting it in ships to consumption centres. Swan will offtake around one million tonnes per year of LNG produced by the OLNG, which will be delivered to the FSRU built by Swan in Gujarat, it had said on 14 December.",2017-01-30,XFUIGbUDdpzOYW6vCKE8yO,"Swan Energy is building the project in joint venture with Exmar of Belgium, which holds a 38% stake in the project",22:47,IFFCO eyes 10% stake in Swan Energys LNG terminal
0.24,"Bengaluru: Indias bid to construct liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers locally under the Make in India plan has collapsed yet again, with state-run natural gas firm GAIL (India) Ltd scrapping a tenderthe second in less than two yearsto hire as many as nine new such ships from global fleet owners to transport gas from the US. 
				   
				Two Japanese-led consortiums had submitted bids before the 15 October deadline set by GAIL, which contended that the two groups had submitted deviations to the tender terms that were not permissible. The bidding groups want GAIL to spare them from paying huge penalties arising from potential non-performance of the Indian-built LNG tankersessentially they want GAIL to assume a larger share of the potential risks on locally built ships. The tender is closed, an official with one of the two bidding groups said, asking not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. It is no longer valid, he said, adding that the government could not decide on a request from GAIL on what to do with the deviations even after the bid validity was extended by a fortnight on 30 September. Confirming the development, a GAIL official said that the company would come out with a fresh tender to hire the ships but whether that will incorporate the stipulation to build part of the ships in India was yet to be decided. These issues are still being discussed, the official said, requesting anonymity. A spokesperson for GAIL could not immediately be reached for comment. A consortium of Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd (MOL)-Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha Ltd (NYK Line) and Mitsui and Co. Ltd and another group comprising Mitsubishi Corp.-Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd (K Line)-GasLog Ltd and Foresight Ltd applied for one of the most sought after shipping tenders globally. The contract, estimated to be worth $7 billion, involved hiring nine new LNG tankers for shipping 5.8 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa) of gas from the US. GAIL will not order the ships directly at shipyardsboth overseas and Indian. It plans to hire the LNG carriers from global fleet owners who will have to construct three of the nine tankers in India as part of the Make in India plan of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In todays market, it costs more than $200 million to build an LNG ship from scratch. Indias state-run Cochin Shipyard Ltd is the only local yard that has fulfilled the eligibility criteria set by GAIL to build the LNG tankers. It has signed a technology collaboration pact with South Koreas Samsung Heavy Industries Co. Ltd to build the LNG ships. It has also secured a licence from GTT, France, to use its patented Mark-III LNG containment systems. Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan told Parliament recently that the first tender issued in 2014 had to be scrapped because none of the qualified foreign shipyards were able to sign binding collaboration pacts with an Indian shipyard for transferring LNG shipbuilding technology when the deadline for submitting bids ended after three extensions. In the second round of tendering, seven of the top global LNG ship owners formed two separate consortia to put in bids. But there were differences between GAIL and the bidders on sharing of risks on Indian-built LNG carriers. The tender terms, according to the bidding groups, loaded all risks on Indian-built LNG ships on to them. GAIL, on its part, was not willing to assume those risks. Make in India can work if both GAIL and the government extend support to the fleet owners, said an executive associated with one of the bidding groups. Make in India is not only one partys headache. GAIL/government cannot say that you are getting business so you take all the risks for Make in India. It has to be a collaborative effort. The government, GAIL and lenders have to come together. You cannot treat a tender at par for LNG ships to be built at experienced South Korean yards and those to be built at an Indian yard for the first time. Wherever LNG carriers are built for the first time, strong support was extended by the governmentbe it in China, Korea or Japan. It does need the support of everybody, the executive said. A shipbuilding executive closely associated with the bidding process, however, said that the concerns raised by the bidding groups on Indian-built ships were unfounded. Cochin Shipyard would build the carriers based on design provided by Samsung Heavy Industries and LNG containment systems licensed from GTT. Hence, the perception on quality and risk concerns expressed by bidders are misplaced, the executive said.

0.64,"Oil companies are likely to report a decent set of numbers for the December quarter. Singapore gross refining margin (GRM), though lower on a year-on-year basis, has improved sequentially (see chart). Nevertheless, a better refining environment is expected to reflect in the December quarter numbers of Indian refining companies. GRM is a measure of the difference between the per barrel price of crude oil and the value of products distilled from it.
				   
				State-run oil marketing companies (OMCs)Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Indian Oil Corp. Ltdare expected to report a good quarter thanks to a recovery in GRMs and inventory gains. While we assume inventory gains (GRM $1-2 a barrel, marketing segment $1-1.5 a barrel), we think OMCs could surprise, pointed out Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd. OMC stocks have outperformed the BSE Sensex so far this fiscal year. Currently, they trade in the range of about 9-12 times estimated earnings for FY17.For Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), improvement in refining margins is expected to be set off to an extent against muted performance from its petrochemicals business. Analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd expect RILs earnings to be largely flat versus the September quarter. That is because, according to Jefferies, the companys GRM is likely to improve by a more modest $0.7 a barrel to $10.8 a barrel in the December quarter due to a five-week maintenance shutdown at one of its FCC (fluid catalytic cracking) units and sharper improvement in gasoline and fuel oil cracks relative to middle distillate cracks. Middle distillate products account for a relatively higher share of RILs product slate.Secondly, the companys blended petrochemical margin has been slightly lower last quarter. Further, the impact of currency demonetization needs to be watched on the petrochemicals segment. Management commentary on the telecom business and updates on downstream projects will be crucial for the RIL stock, which has underperformed the benchmark Sensex so far this fiscal year.Meanwhile, earnings of upstream oil companiesOil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd and Oil India Ltdare expected to benefit from the strength in crude oil prices. On the flip side, some of those gains are likely to be offset by the 18% cut in domestic gas price.

The only second non-Tata to take charge of the group after Nowroji Saklatvala in 1932, Mistry by virtue of his age came in with a lot of promise, specially of continuity when he became chairman of Tata Sonsthe promoter of the major operating Tata companies at the age of 44. However, in nearly four years since he took over the reins of the salt-to-software conglomerate, Mistry had to face many challenges in both domestic and global markets as many of the group companies faced headwinds. He undertook a strategy of divesting assets in contrast to what his successor did. Significant among them is the groups steel business, specially Tata Steel Europe. Earlier this year, the company had completed selling of the European long products business in the UK as well as a mill in France to Greybull Capital. It had also announced plans to sell its UK operations after years of losses, although the company is yet to finalize the sale. In July, Tata groups hospitality firm Indian Hotels Company Ltd (IHCL), which runs Taj Group of hotels, completed sale of Taj Boston hotel for $125 million (about Rs839 crore). The hospitality firm had also sold off 12.7 lakh shares of Belmond (earlier known as Orient Express, which the Tata Group tried unsuccessfully to acquire in Ratan Tatas time) for a consideration of $11.96 million.

OVL will tie-up long-term financing in the next six to nine months to replace the bridge loan, he said. Besides OVLs 26%, a consortium of comprising Oil India (OIL), Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Bharat PetroResources (BPRL) has acquired 23.9% stake in the field at a cost of $2.02 billion, giving them 6.56 million tons of oil.Also Read: Cabinet allows ONGC Videsh to buy 11% stake in Russias JSC Vankorneft After the stake sales, Rosneft holds 50.1%  stake in JSC Vankorneft, the company that operates the Vankor oilfield.

That agreement was subject to certain conditions including approvals from the Indian and Russian governments. All approvals are in place, leading to closure of the deal, he said. The completion within very short period of the binding agreement reflects the speed and cooperation with which both OVL and Rosneft have moved and the support that the investments by Indian companies in Russian oil sector enjoy with the Russian and Indian governments. Vankor is Rosnefts (and Russias) second largest field by production and accounts for 4% of the countrys production.Also Read: OVL, Rosneft sign pact for 11% stake in Vankorneft The daily production from the field is around 410,000 barrels per day of crude oil and 26% stake would give OVL about 107,000 bpd. The acquisition of additional 11% would add about 30% to the existing OVLs production at the current rate and approximately 2.2 million tons of oil and 1.0 billion cubic meters of gas annually, he said.

But that would be a challenge for any person, and Chandra looks better placed than other rumoured contenders for the role.ALSO READ | How TCS chief N. Chandrasekaran became Tata Sons chairmanA bigger worry is how TCS manages the transition in leadership. In the past seven years, the company contributed over 90% of Tata Sons total dividend income. TCS is effectively the goose that lays the golden egg for the Tata group. If growth stutters at the company as a result of the leadership transition, the entire group will be affected adversely.Chandrasekaran developed relationships with large clients, oversaw operations and held myriad things together simultaneously. To say that he will be missed is an understatement. Whats more, unlike the time when he himself took over as CEO from S. Ramadorai, there has been no clear succession planning.ALSO READ | Safe choice Chandrasekaran will be tested as Tata Sons chairmanRajesh Gopinathans appointment as the new CEO comes across more as a sudden response to the evolving situation at Tata Sons, rather than a planned move. According to an analyst with a multinational brokerage firm, while Gopinathan is sharp and intelligent, his elevation as CEO is likely to irk more senior colleagues who headed business for large geographies and verticals.What makes things look disconcerting is the current backdrop of demand for IT outsourcing. The shift in customers spending patterns from traditional services to digital services has hurt companies such as TCS.Besides, the election of Donald Trump is likely to increase visa and other costs for outsourcing companies. So while Chandrasekaran took over at a time when things were beginning to turn around for the industry (in end 2009), Gopinathan is taking over when things are looking increasingly precarious.ALSO READ | N.

				The re-balancing of the oil market should take place by the end of the first half of the year, Al-Falih told reporters during an energy event in the United Arab Emirates capital of Abu Dhabi. Demand will pick up in the summer, and Opec wants to make sure markets are well-supplied, he said.We dont think its necessary, given the level of compliance we have seen and given the expectations of demand, Al-Falih said on Monday. The re-balancing which started slowly in 2016 will have its full impact by the first half. Of course, there are many variables that can come into play between now and June, and at that time we will be able to reassess.Saudi Arabia is due to meet fellow members of the Opec in May at their bi-annual meeting in Vienna to assess the market and the groups production policy. Opec states will also gather with major producers outside the group later this month in the Austrian capital to monitor their compliance with the production cuts, which aim to reduce inventories and shore up prices.

The cuts took effect on 1 January and are to last through June.All players have indicated their willingness to extend, if necessary, Al-Falih said. Based on my judgement today, I think its unlikely that we will need to continue. Demand is going to pick up in the summer, and we want to make sure the markets continue to be supplied well. We dont want to create a shortage or a squeeze, so the extension will only happen if theres a need, and if theres a a need, we will do it. Two years of market chaos led to the agreement, with decreases in investment and profits underscoring the need for joint action by producers inside and outside of Opec, he said. Extra MileAl-Falih said he was confident of the deals success. Many countries are going the extra mile in making deeper production cuts than they pledged, and Opec will stop intervening in the market once global crude inventories return to their five-year average, he said.Saudi Arabia has cut production to less than 10 million barrels a day, below its targeted level, and is currently producing at a 22-month low, Al-Falih said on 12 January in Abu Dhabi.

-0.43,"Tata Sons Ltd on Thursday accused ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry of betraying the trust it had reposed in him and seeking to control the main operating companies of the Tata group to the exclusion of Tata Sons and other Tata representatives.
				   
				Mistrys aides issued a rebuttal saying the Tata Sons statement reflects desperation.It is unfortunate that Tata Sons, acting in good faith, did not anticipate such devious moves by Mr. Mistry and thereby did not inform the other directors of the operating companies about its dissatisfaction with Mr. Mistry at the level of Tata Sons. However, we will now do whatever is required to deal with this situation, the group holding company said in a statement.It added that Tata Sons had expected Mistry to resign as chairman of the group operating companies once he was ousted as chairman of the holding company and his refusal demonstrates his absolute disregard of longstanding Tata traditions, values and ethos.This is the first time since removing Mistry on 24 October that Tata Sons has elaborated on the ostensible reasons for his ouster. Since then, the independent directors of Indian Hotels Co. Ltd (IHCL) and Tata Chemicals Ltd have backed Mistry.Pointing to the first instance, the Tata note said this reveal the true colours of Mr. Mistry and his ulterior objective. It accused him of trying to gain control of IHCL by ensuring he would be the only Tata Sons representative on its board over the years. The statement said this seems to have been Mistrys strategy, planned and executed over the past four years.A person close to Mistry refuted charges of an ulterior motive of taking control of companies. He said giving the example of Indian Hotels only because independent directors, one of whom is also a director of Tata Trust, demonstrated true independence, is not in keeping with Tata governance standards, the person said.A look at the board composition of the top six listed Tata group firms where Mistry is chairman shows at least half the board was appointed before 2012, when he took charge. The Tata statement, which runs into nine pages, also cited falling dividend income and increasing impairment provisions, ballooning debt and low return on investments as reasons for removing him as chairman of the $103 billion group.Tata Sons also alleged that under Mistry, the edifice of the group founded in 1868 had been consciously dismantled, resulting in operating companies drifting away from the promoter company and their shareholders.With the exception of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), dividends received from all 40 other firms (many non-dividend paying) in its portfolio have continuously declined from Rs1,000 crore in 2012-13 to Rs780 crore in 2015-16 but the latter figure includes additional interim dividend of Rs100 crores which would have been normally received in 2016-17 (due to budgetary changes), the statement said. It added that in the past four years, the groups debt had increased by Rs69,877 crore to over Rs2.25 trillion.Despite huge investments by firms, the returns are not visible in increased profits, though, in all fairness, some major growth projects like the new steel plant at Kalinganagar will show results only in coming years, the statement said.The person close to Mistry said the Tata Sons statement had selective data, unsubstantiated claims and half truths, without a word of explanation as to why it became necessary to remove him summarily, violating natural justice and without explanation.This person pointed to the high operating profit margin of 14% for Tata Steel Europe in 2014 and the narrowing losses in the Mundra power project (admittedly because of lower coal prices) as examples of improvement under Mistry. This was the largest turnaround in Indian corporate history involving multiple companies and is still a work in progress, said this person.Proxy advisory firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS) said the Tata statement is inconsistent.You cant blame him (Mistry) for non-performance of one company and not give any credit for the good show of the other, said Amit Tandon, IiAS founder and managing director. Mistrys aide cited earlier said the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of Tata Sons lauded his performance on 28 June and its report was adopted by the entire board. Tata Sons is yet to state what necessitated the replacement of Mr. Mistry on October 24 without any notice or an opportunity to defend himself, this person said.

				Companies currently pay 9.09% of the price they realise on oil and gas produced from onland or onshore fields and 16.67% on the same from offshore areas. The Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC), in a recent clarification, has stated that the licence granted by the government to a company to exploit a natural resource is a taxable service and hence liable for service tax.As a rule, service tax is paid by the entity providing the service, but in certain cases it is the liability of the party that receives the service to remit the levy under a system called reverse charge. In the circular clarifying on service tax liability on use of wireless spectrum, CBEC stated that all periodic payments such as royalty on use of natural resources will attract 15% service tax.Following the clarification, the Service Tax department has sent letters to companies like Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), Cairn India Ltd and Reliance Industries seeking information on royalty payments, industry sources said.These companies had paid a total of Rs4,885 crore royalty on oil and gas produced in 2015-16. Considering change in prices and production profile, the service tax liability would come to over Rs730 crore this fiscal on top of the royalty payout. CBEC is using the logic that since service tax is leviable on wireless spectrum, which is a natural resources, the same should extend to oil and gas as well.Sources said energy explorers through their association have taken up the matte with the oil ministry saying their profitability has been severely impacted by slump in oil and gas prices to multi-year low and the additional levy would erode it further. CBEC in the circular stated that one-time payments for natural resources are exempt from service tax but not any periodic payments. Oil companies have to pay royalty on a monthly basis. Exemption from payment of service tax is applicable only to one time charge, payable in full upfront or in installments, for assignment of right to use any natural resource and not to any periodic payment required to be made such as Spectrum User Charges, license fee in respect of spectrum, or monthly payments with respect to the coal extracted from the coal mine or royalty payable on extracted coal and other natural resources, CBEC has said.

Indian refining firms had benefited from substantial inventory gains in the June quarter, but that advantage will not be available for the September quarter, as there may not be a major inventory impact considering oil prices have not moved dramatically.
				   
				Whats more, refining margins have inched up only a bit. Benchmark Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) last quarter came in at $5.1 a barrel against $5 a barrel in the June quarter. In short, even though refining margins have risen a bit, lack of substantial inventory gains will mean that reported GRMs of Indian refining firms are likely to be sequentially lower.State-run refining and marketing companiesBharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd are no exception to that trend. On an overall basis, subdued refining performance will more than offset the benefit of robust market margins (calculated diesel retail margins up 32% QoQ) and healthy marketing volumes, wrote Edelweiss Securities Ltd analysts in their September quarter preview. Five brokerage firms previews studied by Mint show  that Ebitda of all three companies is expected to fall against the June quarter.

0.39,"Steve Hasker, global president and chief operating officer at Nielsen Holding plc, was in India to meet clients and speak on the growing importance of mobile in advertising at the Mobile Marketing Association conference in Gurgaon. 
				   
				During the trip, he met executives from PepsiCo, Nestle, Reckitt Benckiser, Tata group, BARC India and Facebook, among others.India is a very important market for us. The visit was to ensure our success continues and we stay connected with clients, Hasker said as he explained the importance of Nielsens newly launched Total Audience Measurement tool in the US. Edited excerpts:What does Total Audience Measurement include?Total Audience Measurement, thats been launched in the US, has the ability to measure any piece of video, audio or text, on any device at any time and to do it seamlessly and consistently. It has an advertising measurement component and a content measurement component and the ability to put them together. It obviously has a TV, PC, connected device and tablet, and smartphone component and in the US, we have rolled out all those pieces.Here in India, we have started with the digital ad ratings. So, we started with the advertising component. In the coming months, we look to launch the content ratings. But Total Audience Measurement is more than just digital?What Total Audience Measurement does is, it takes all the digital touch points and combines with TV advertising. So, for any campaign, an agency will say, okay, I should think about TV relative to these digital touch points. Should I buy more TV or less TV? This is very important because different markets have different objectives in terms of reach and frequency. Right now, Total Audience Measurement is available in the US; but we have also launched in Mexico and a version of it in Brazil.When will you introduce it in India?To a large extent, that is dependent on BARC (Broadcast Audience Research Council). They have the TV data. In theory, we could do it today because BARC data and digital ad ratings are consistent; but it requires an advertiser to put those two together.Is linear TV declining?What we have seen in a number of countries is the pressure on TV ratings. The size and frequency of audiences watching television has come under pressure in some of the more developed markets like the US, UK and Australia. And that has meant growth in terms of time spent on digital devices. However, what marketers are trying and have now started to understand is that TV has a reasonably unique value proposition in terms of the ability to tell a story to consumers in a way that is accepted by them. And that many large brand campaigns need a TV component. So, the ability to come out of TV altogether and going to digital was overstated. Particularly in 2016 in many markets, we have seen a reversion back to TV and more reliance on TV from an advertising perspective. But the UK and US numbers suggest digital ad revenue has surpassed TV numbers.In the UK, digital surpassed TV a number of years ago; and in the US, it has surpassed in the past 18 months. Those numbers are for real. But this year, in what we call the upfronts which is the mechanism of buying and selling advertising on TV in US, we have seen some reversion back to TV. What a number of major advertisers found that they probably swung the pendulum too far toward digital; and in doing so, they saw some decrease in reach of their campaigns to their target audience. Was losing Indias TV market to BARC a big setback for Nielsen?We certainly enjoyed being part of the TAM joint venture (between Nielsen and Kantar Media owned by WPP Plc) for quite a long period of time. We are very supportive of BARC. We met BARC and have a good relationship. Wed like to help them if we can. So we are looking forward. We think therell be an opportunity to do that. Which are the successful digital models globally? What we have seen in the last couple of years in the US and many countries is the emergence of truly spectacular digital models. One of course is Google with its search model thats been extended to YouTube. And the second is Facebook. In fact, Google, Facebook and, increasingly, Snapchat are proving to be very successful digital models partly because they have attracted disproportionate amounts of consumer time and attention and partly because they have an economic model which is very efficient. Facebook announced last week it had 4 million advertisers. And one of the great things about Facebook and Google platforms is that for an advertiser, they are extremely easy to use. You can target a particular audience and you can buy using your credit card So for advertisers and agencies, it is a great model. It is also a highly profitable model.What about newspaper publishers?It is more difficult for traditional publishersnewspapers or magazines or what we call pure play digital content websites and portals because the audiences access their content through Google, Facebook and Snapchat. In other words, the means in which they get content is through one of these larger players and, secondly, the time and attention is smaller on their properties.So, whats their future?In an increasingly fragmented and complicated world, great journalism, great video production, great TV production is not easier to do. So, even though we have got this great democratization of information and it is freely available in many different places, the ability to interpret news and write insightful commentary around the news, does not become easier in that environment. So, the value attached to that goes up not down.Whats happened here is that theres been a significant disruption in the distribution mechanism; so, whether it is a newspaper or a TV channel , or magazine, consumers now have many different ways to get to that content but, ultimately, the content itself has to be incredibly valuable. And now, done properly, there are more ways to monetize great journalism than there were previously. Right now, what media formats is venture capital (VC) chasing?VCs are very good at sniffing out areas of growth. So they are focused on a couple of thingsone is video. That is, players who are in the digital video space, either producing or distributing video content. Secondly, they are focused on players who have interesting data setson consumer identity or consumer behaviourpurchase behaviour or media consumption behaviour. The other place VCs are more focused on is fintechlike mobile payments and also on healthcare related apps and start-ups.Nielsen acquired Indicus Analytics in India. Are you eyeing more firms here?We would like to make more, provided they enhance our business and make sense financially. For us, India is a very important market. What is the next big thing for Nielsen?The big area of focus for us will be the connected system. We have two businesses. One measures media behaviour, the other measures consumption of consumer packaged goods and provides all kinds of analytics around that. In the media business, the big investment is Total Audience Measurement, and, as we said, we have rolled that out in many countries and we are in the process of bringing that to India. The second area is to build the connected system which links the market share data to explanatory analytics. Say, for instance, did the market share of Kinley water go up because of better product innovation like a new bottle size, different packaging or concept, or did it go up because its marketing has been more effectivetheres been more money on digital and more money on TV. Or did it go up because of in-store execution, its pricing, promotion and assortment was better. So, the connected system will, in real time, enable the brand manager of a particular brand to understand how am I doingwhat happened, why did it happen and what should I do next.So, were in the process of prototyping this with a number of clients across the world and we would look to introduce this here in India sometime next year. We are piloting it with six clients at the moment in different parts of the world. This is our biggest area of investment for the next five years.",2016-10-17,bNj32jkOPJkyiWyZYj8wxO,"India is a very important market for Nielsen, says global president and chief operating officer Steve Hasker",01:41,Some digital advertising is moving back to TV: Nielsens Steve Hasker

Wadia said he had warned of possible future losses from the merged entity. He and other board members had also expressed serious apprehensions on the proposal for the Rs800 crore acquisition of the Brunner Mond Group in the UK, Kenya and Netherlands, he wrote.Wadia, who is chairman of Bombay Dyeing and Manufacturing Co.

Mukundan held a meeting of senior management and asked them to sign a pre-drafted letter seeking to endorse the stand of Tata Sons Ltd. In this representation, Wadia had said that at the board meeting, which followed the meeting of independent directors on 10 November, Mukundan conveyed that in the event the independent directors chose to issue any statement which made a reference to Tata Sonss ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry, he would not permit the company secretary to issue the proposed communication. This, he had said, was a serious cause for concern on the lack of corporate governance in the conduct of the affairs of the company resulting from the undue interference by the dominant promoter.Wadia claimed that the cross-holdings of Tata Chemicals in other Tata companies are being maintained to indirectly keep the voting rights and control in Tata Sons.

-0.18,"Shares of state-run oil producers Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) have risen about 5-6% year-to-date. That falls short of an about 10% increase seen in the benchmark Sensex. Lower crude oil and gas prices, along with unexciting production trends, have kept sentiments low for these stocks.
				   
				According to some analysts, things may soon get better. Spark Capital Advisors (India) Pvt. Ltd pointed out in a report on ONGC recently that crude oil prices are likely to head towards $60 a barrel over the next 12-18 months, led by ongoing capex (capital expenditure) and production cuts across the E&P (exploration and production) industry, a potential supply freeze by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries over the next 12 months, likely narrowing of excess supplies and stabilization of prices from the latter half of the current fiscal year.Needless to say, higher oil prices are key for investor sentiment to revive in these stocks. The recently announced June quarter results of these companies reflect the impact of lower crude oil prices. Net price realizations of both companies declined year-on-year. ONGC and OILs net realizations declined 22% and 25% to $46.1 a barrel and $43.09 a barrel, respectively. But that was on expected lines. The measure was higher sequentially, helped by a recovery in broader crude oil prices after touching lows earlier in 2016.As expected, the drop in realization led to a drop in profits. ONGCs Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) declined 23% to Rs9,390 crore. This excludes exploration costs that were written off. Again, ONGCs Ebitda was above some analysts estimates owing to lower-than-expected other expenses. OILs Ebitda declined 29% to Rs863 crore.On the flip side, production performance is far from encouraging. ONGCs crude oil production declined 2% year-on-year and was flat compared to the March quarter. OILs crude oil production declined 4.6% over last years June quarter but was 2.8% higher than the March quarter. To be sure, ONGC subsidiary ONGC Videsh Ltds (OVLs) production increased 12% year-on-year but that includes volumes from its stake purchase in Vankor (JSC Vankorneft), Russia. Of course, higher production from Vankor should help to some extent. For fiscal year 2016, OVL reported a net loss of Rs2,094 crore against a net profit of Rs1,904 crore in FY15, as low crude oil prices caused tremendous grief.ONGC and OIL both currently trade at about 12 times their estimated earnings for this fiscal year.

0.27,"London/Muscow: Opecs internal disagreements over how to implement supply cuts prevented a deal to secure the cooperation of other major suppliers after two days of talks in Vienna.
				   
				Nations including Russia and Kazakhstan ended talks at the headquarters of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) on Saturday without making any crude-supply commitments, said Brazils oil and gas secretary Marcio Felix.The producers will meet again for discussions on 25-26 November and the outcome of the process hinges on Iran and Iraq, said Azerbaijans energy minister Natiq Aliyev.A deal with other crude producers wasnt possible after internal Opec talks on Friday reached an impasse over the role of Iran and Iraq, both of which want to be exempt from any cuts. While non-member Oman said Saturday it was willing to cooperate in a supply deal, it couldnt commit to a specific output cut until Opec had its own agreement.Oil-producing nations need to continue dialog and come up with real numbers before cuts can begin, Kazakhstans Deputy Energy Minister Magzum Mirzagaliyev said after the meeting.Opecs surprise agreement in Algiers last month to make the first supply cuts in eight years will only make a serious dent in a record oil surplus if producers outside the group join in. While the accord helped push oil prices to a 15-month high above $50 a barrel earlier this month, they have subsequently fallen as several members disputed the production estimates that would determine the size of cuts. Failure to implement the output reduction agreed last month in Algiers will hurt oil producers, the organizations top official warned.Risk of failureOpec agreed on 28 September to reduce output to a range of 32.5 million to 33 million barrels a day, compared with about 33.4 million in September. None of the countries that attended Fridays meeting specified how much they are willing to cut, said one delegate, who asked not to be identified because the meeting was private. Still, progress was made on the methodology to be used for allocating individual production curbs, the delegate said.Anything short of implementation of this accord could lead to the elongation of the rebalancing process, with further deterioration of financial conditions and setbacks in investments extending into a third year, which would be unprecedented, Opec Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo said at the start of Saturdays meeting.This is a critical time for the oil market, which is still under great pressure because of a large stockpile surplus, Barkindo said, according to a transcript of his speech posted on Opecs website. The price recovery has already taken far too long and producers cant risk delaying it further, he said.Maximum commitmentWe should be calling for maximum commitment from all Opec and non-Opec countries to the Algiers accord, Barkindo said.Representatives of Azerbaijan, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Oman and Russia attended Saturdays meeting with officials from OPEC member states. Those countries collectively produced about 19.6 million barrels a day of oil last year, about 21 percent of global supply and equivalent to half of Opecs output, according to BP Plcs Statistical Review of World Energy.Oman is willing to cut production as part of deal with other producers, but is waiting for Opec to reach an internal agreement before deciding on the size of its own supply reduction, said Ali al Riyami, the nations representative at the meeting in Vienna. The Middle Eastern nation pumped about 1 million barrels a day in May.Rising productionRussia, the largest producer outside Opec, is already pumping at a post-Soviet record of about 11.1 million barrels a day. Prior to Saturdays meeting, energy minister Alexander Novak indicated the country would prefer to freeze at this level as part of any deal, rather than make a cut.Brazil attended the talks only as an observer, to listen to the other oil producers, Felix said before the meeting. The Latin American country will boost output by 290,000 barrels a day next year to 2.9 million a day, the biggest increase of any non-Opec nation, according to the International Energy Agency. Production will keep growing for the next few years, said Felix.Kazakhstan also plans to boost output next year following the restart this month of the $50 billion Kashagan oil field after 16 years of development. The field is currently pumping about 100,000 barrels day, which should rise to 200,000 by year-end and 370,000 by the end of 2017, Italian oil company Eni SpA said Friday.

0.62,"Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus of Tata Sons Ltd, served as chairman of the Tata group from 1991 till 2012. He continues to head the groups charitable trusts. The groups philanthropic initiatives are wide ranging and have evolved with the changing economic conditions of the country. Starting with building institutions of repute to hospitals, to research facilities for the socioeconomic integration of the marginalized communities, the groups social engagement has been moulded and influenced by the family values of the Tatas. He talks about why poverty alleviation is key to his philanthropy, how his grandmother influenced him about how to stimulate the wealthy to give more, why access to natural resources is important to improve lives and the India Philanthropy Initiative. Edited excerpts from an interview conducted by Bridgespan in partnership with Mint:
				   
				How did you start your philanthropic journey?I grew up in a family that was driven by philanthropy. My grandmother with whom we spent a great deal of timeshe brought us up because my parents were separatedinfluenced me. We were steeped into philanthropy, whether it would be for the household staff or the person on the street. She was in fact for a period of time, the chairperson of the Sir Ratan Tata Trust. We grew up in that aura of giving back to the people or alleviating misery if we could. Formally I became involved with philanthropy when I became a trustee of the Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Were there people or incidents or experiences that you used to inform your approach to philanthropy, the formal version of it?As a young man growing up, it was the environment that I spoke of, which set the pace and the tone of my journey of how one makes contributions to make a difference.How is the Sir Ratan Tata Trust changing from its old avatar?We look at our trusts collectively. The bigger ones undertook projects of philanthropy which were very far reaching in those days, be it a cancer hospital or a hotel that would be open to Indians or donations in the interest of tuberculosis. My grandmother gave away all the homes she and her husband had all over India so that sanatoriums for consumptive people, who needed to be isolated, could be made or old peoples homes could be set up. And then a fair amount of philanthropy was in the form of alleviating individual hardships, such as funds for treatment or surgery. We give much more than we did in those days but we are trying to be relevant. We are trying to participate in research for cancer, for diabetes, getting institutes in place to make the treatments affordable and reachable to the common man, looking at agricultural inputs that alleviate poverty in a rural community. What has led to this shift broadly?I cant say that there was a motivator that was defined. For example, one of the big changes has been combating malnutrition today among infants. Just the fact that we are losing so many children in India at infancy. It took only a few weeks of research to realize that we couldnt do that without involving the mother, who is also malnutritioned. We also found out very fast that we couldnt really do much unless we focused on hygiene and sanitation. It become a holistic activity. We undertook pilot projects in eight districts across multiple states to work out the systems for this and its been a real eye-opener. We have received tremendous support from the state government whom we were working with.Any advice for a philanthropist thinking about doing problem solving?The only advice I would give is there is a lot of money that is probably less effectively used or employed because someone has not done enough research on what the problems are. One of the changes we made is that we are no longer a purely grant-giving philanthropic organization. We moved from there into being involved ourselves in some of the projects that we have, we manage them ourselves or jointly with an NGO (non-governmental organization) but not only through an NGO.In the past, we would support an NGO for eight years or 10 years and then move those funds and allocate in another place. You would assume that this community by now would be self-sustaining. But when you withdrew your funds, the NGO collapsed, the community collapsed and you become the most hated person or hated organization there is. Sustainability in development has been a new call and we realize that communities dont need handoutsthey need prosperity and dignity. So our grants today, wherever we give them, put sustainability as one of the mileposts. I mean as far as possible, the idea is to make the community self-sustaining and have the dignity which I think everybody wants. How do you measure your success ?I think to a great extent it is about trying to establish and understanding what the real problems are. You have got to define your goals effectively.What characterizes a professionalized NGO?I cant answer that particularly but sometimes its not scale. Very often an NGO tends to forget the traditional outlooks of a community and ignore it, so that what they try to dohowever well intentioneddoesnt work.What is your assessment of the current state of CSR (corporate social responsibility) in India? And what needs to be done to improve it?I have a sort of philosophical view. The CSR funds have to come from somewhere. I think there would be a fair amount of abuse of these funds and the government will have to do some regulation to make sure that these are effectively used. It would not be a bad thing if the government had defined X number of causes to which you can officially give these funds, which would work for rural prosperity. I think even if large projects, a public works projects, were funded in this way, there is nothing wrong in that but the government may have to define what they are. CSR could become an avenue for innovative thinking on how you can improve the quality of life, and it could be a very powerful toolor it could be wasted. How do you see the state of philanthropy in India?I think the new type of philanthropy that we talked about, that is looking at making donations or making funds available in far-reaching terms, is starting to happen. But a large amount of philanthropy is in the more traditional formsmaybe to build temples or hospitals, not so concerned about what it actually does, but that edifices are created because that establishes that you did A or B or C. I think India has to move like other countries into a more sophisticated form of philanthropy which makes a difference and is designed to make a difference rather than just creating edifices. Do you have a philosophy of philanthropy?If I put it into one sentence, I think you really want to be doing things that make a difference. If you cannot make a difference, if its just water trickling through a tap or leading through a drainage system, its wasteful. Have you changed because of the philanthropy? How has it affected you?Yes I think so. I was the chairman of the trust while I was chairman of Tata Sons. I may have chaired the trust but I didnt spend as much time or have had much depth of involvement as I do today and thats been an eye-opener. I have become more sensitive to the pain and the suffering that exists. I am more involved with where we should do more and where we should be bolder in terms of the amount of money that we allocate. And it also made me more sensitive to the likely abuse of funds.The Bridgespan Group, an adviser and resource for mission-driven leaders and organizations, in partnership with Mint interviewed several philanthropists across India to trace their journeys and share their learningsConversations with Remarkable Givers: India.ALSO READ | Philanthropy benefits the philanthropistALSO READ | How a small donation secures freedomALSO READ | Strategic giving for impact",2016-10-03,eZ5raUtIs7kmScXuchQY9M,Tata Sons chairman emeritus Ratan Tata on why poverty alleviation is key to his philanthropy and why access to natural resources is important to improve lives,03:03,You really want to be doing things that make a difference: Ratan Tata
-0.69,"The rise in crude oil prices, coming on the back of a disruption caused by demonetization, is a double whammy for paint firms. If the liquidity crunch is affecting volumes, higher costs can affect margins if companies decide to absorb the cost so as to not disturb demand.
				   
				The increase in crude oil prices appears to be sustainable so far, as oil-producing countries have agreed to production cuts. This could see an increase in the petroleum-based solvents that paint firms use. If the rising crude prices sees derivatives such as plastics becoming expensive, that can result in higher packaging costs. Lastly, freight costs will increase once fuel prices are hiked.Another key raw material, titanium dioxide (TiO2), has seen prices rise both month-on-month and over a year ago. Firms import their requirement and could see their costs increase as contracts get renewed at higher rates. If lower costs helped firms improve profitability in the past (even if demand was not as strong), they now face a situation where rising costs may eat into margins.If average oil prices increase by a further 10%, the estimated FY18 EPS for consumer firms such as Asian Paints Ltd and Berger Paints India Ltd could be lower by 8%, other things remaining same, cautioned JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd in a recent report. EPS stands for earnings per share.The timing makes it worse. Demonetization has affected decorative paints demand, a segment that is discretionary by nature and cash plays a key role. Our channel check suggests demand in decoratives segment has fallen 40% in November and December. For the industrials segment, volumes have been affected to the tune of 25%, Amit Agarwal, a Kotak Securities analyst said.In a recent Nomura report, the managements of major paint companies such as Asian Paints and Berger Paints said offtake is down, with Berger stating that demand is down to 40-45% of its original level. They also said the situation is improving as dealers have begun moving to digital payments.Still, volume growth is expected to be under pressure for two quarters. Some brokerages have trimmed their earnings estimates of paint companies factoring in lower volumes. We have cut earnings for Asian Paints higher than for most consumer companies, said a Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd report.That makes for a sobering outlook even as there is uncertainty on whether oil prices can go up further. Though demonetization is not a structural issue, it has jolted demand, and it is difficult to judge how soon consumption will recover to normal levels. Thus, paint stocks could remain under pressure till signs of a recovery come in sight.",2016-12-16,eeRiGizOwQ0ayyGOy6MUCL,"If the liquidity crunch following demonetisation is affecting volumes, higher costs in wake of Opec oil production cuts can affect margins if companies decide to absorb the cost ",07:48,Paints: not a pretty picture 
0.83,"Bengaluru: Bhaskar Bhat, 62, has been at the helm of Tata group firm Titan Co. Ltd for nearly 15 years. His association with the Tata Watch Project, which eventually led to the creation of Titan, has continued for more than three decades, during which he has seen the Titan brand expand from watches into jewellery, eyewear and precision engineering.
				   
				About four months ago, Titan entered yet another categorytraditional womens wearas part of a pilot project, while watches and jewellery continue to be its mainstay, accounting for a major portion of its revenue. Unlike the jewellers in the unorganized sector who have been hit by demonetization, Titan expects the governments move to help boost its sales in the longer run. The company estimates it has less than 5% market share in jewellery and therefore abundant headroom for growth.As of now there are no acquisition plans in the pipeline, says Bhat, and the companys focus is on integrating brands such as CaratLane in jewellery and Favre-Leuba in watches and Maison Montblancwhich makes jewellery, writing instruments and leather goodsas all these were acquired less than two years ago. In an interview, Bhat spoke about the companys key business segments and the fillip it expects from demonetization. Edited excerpts:How has this fiscal year shaped up so far and what kind of growth rate do you expect over the next two years?Overall, like we reported, we had been growing in the first six months, by a small amount, but still, growth was there. In fact, we even said that were expecting a 15% growth in the jewellery business and we expect to clock those numbers. In watches also, the growth rates are better than last year. So the year as such is better, that much I can say. We will be able to keep our current rate of growth, i.e. 15%. Whether it will be much more for FY18 and the year after, we cannot say. But for us FY18 will be better than the current year primarily because demonetization has, in a way, sucked the winds out of the sails of the unorganized sector. Do you expect any fallout from demonetization on Titans future performance? Right now I can confidently say that the concerns because of demonetizationfor instance, concerns that there is no cash for daily transactions so I wont buy watcheshas diminished considerably. It was an event that has affected most companies and we have also articulated that we did get affected in the first week to 10 days. After that, normalcy has come back; the informal (unorganized) economy was affected whereas it has not affected us. In the end, consumers have to buy jewellery, watches and eyewear. If the unorganized sector is not able to give them the product, theyll have to come to us, right?Companies that were doing business in black will not be able to transform to our kind of model or any other kind of model where you accept credit cards and cheques, you keep your books of accounts and you pay taxes. Thats not a transition which will occur easily. And that is where the demand which is there, fundamentally, will flow to companies that can and have been operating legitimately.Youve said in the past that the jewellery industry will be full of turmoil due to policy changes. Is that still your expectation, in particular for this year? Over the past two years, there has been considerable turmoil in the jewellery industry. Gold-on-lease was stopped and later restored, customs duty was increased from 6% to 10%. Then excise duty was introduced and, if you remember, stores were closed for 43 days. Disclosing PAN cards was introduced for purchases above Rs5 lakh and then further dropped to those over Rs 2 lakh. And then we had demonetization. But I think jewellers have now learnt a lesson. At what rate the government decides to impose GST (goods and services tax) is the only other policy change in store and that will benefit us because a lot of the jewellers will have to fall in linedemonetization plus GST is a nightmare for them. So we should benefit from FY18 onward.Which of your jewellery brands are you betting big on and do you expect sales from your Golden Harvest Scheme (GHS) to get a significant boost going ahead?There is a lot of excitement in CaratLane, which we acquired, and Mia. Both are appealing to younger consumers. But between Tanishq, Mia, Zoya, CaratLaneTanishq is certainly the biggest brand. It is a very steady high-growth brand and is at a very high level of sales. Sales from GHS are basically advance booking orders; so youve got a guarantee that one year later at least this much business you will do. Its always been 15-20% of our sales. We aggressively push GHS. Maybe its contribution to sales can increase a little more but I dont see it becoming the new normal.Watches and eyewear have not been doing too well. Whats the plan to boost sales? Watches are bought today as an accessory, not as a time-keeping device. So the strategy is clearly accessorization and premiumization. Getting into the smartwatch segment is also a strategy that weve introduced and were doing well at it. Eyewear has been slow this year, yes. Right now the effort is in ensuring existing stores grow rather than new stores. Growth will come out of the so-called same-store sales growth mantra. Is Titan planning to enter any new categories? We began piloting traditional womens wear in October and are looking at opening a physical store. And we still have to grow perfumes, for example, which is still at a level of Rs30-40 crore. So we dont have any other category in the pipeline. What is your strategy when it comes to competing with online marketplaces? We participate, we dont compete. In watches, we are with online marketplaces like Flipkart and Myntra, and we have a strict contractual obligation with them as to what price they can sell our products at. Discounting is at our behest, not theirs and they have agreed to this so theyve become a partner. The biggest advantage we have is we have offline stores. Our strategy has always been omnichannel but there are very big advantages of bricks and mortar, which I think bricks-and-mortar companies need to play up and not just assume that everybody is going to migrate to online. The need to go to a store is least in watches, because watches you can buy online also, and highest in jewellery. The higher the ticket size, the more risk-averse people will get. So convenience is not everything when you are buying. And I think this trend of buying eyewear online is a passing phase. People will realize that unless you get the quality that you want, it can be quite bad. If your lens is not good enough, for example, its a risk. You also cant touch and feel your frame (before placing an order online). Youve been associated with Titan, and earlier the Tata Watch Project for about three decades. What would you say is the one significant event in the history of the company? We didnt know a thing about retail. So the first retail store we opened in Safina Plaza (a shopping complex in central Bengaluru) in the late 1980s was very memorable. It was a 350-square-foot store but it was very well designed. I remember we sold 17 watches on the first day and we were very thrilled! That was a significant event in the life of Titanthe introduction of retailing.When you look back, I dont think we ever dreamt that we would be a watches, and jewellery, and eyewear, and precision engineering company. It was inconceivable. We were just about relieved that wed got government approval to get into the watch industry and that we were able to make good watches and overtake HMT in five-six years. After that, its been kind of a dream run.",2017-02-04,eokVM94g0SpP1h72Lt1VFO,Titan MD Bhaskar Bhat on integrating brands such as CaratLane  and why he expects the jewellery business to get a boost from demonetisation,00:41,"Titan will maintain current growth rate over two years, says Bhaskar Bhat"

No final agreement has been reached with any party, the people said. Energy companies have announced $43.2 billion of asset sales this year after crude prices fell to the lowest level in more than a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Chevron, the largest US oil producer after Exxon Mobil Corp., is seeking buyers for Asian geothermal assets that could fetch as much as $3 billion and is also holding talks to sell assets in Indonesia and Thailand, people familiar with the matter said earlier.

-0.16,"The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday gave the green signal to Tata Sons Ltd to hold a planned shareholder meeting on 6 February, which will consider a proposal to remove former chairman Cyrus P Mistry as a director from its board. 
				   
				The tribunal refused to grant a stay despite being pressed by the counsel of Mistrys family investment firms, Aryama Sundaram. This bench has not passed any stay on the EGM (extraordinary general meeting) scheduled for 6th February. ... Relief (to Mistry family firms) is recused. Now either the petitioner can file an appeal or be bound by an order, said B.S.V. Prakash Kumar, one of the two members of the NCLT bench.Earlier this month, the Mistry firms filed a contempt of court petition seeking a stay on the Tata Sons EGM. This has been dismissed by the NCLT, which asked the firms to club it with their original petition alleging mismanagement of Tata Sons and oppression of minority shareholders. Cyrus Mistry was ousted as chairman of Tata Sons in a boardroom putsch on 24 October.The bench asked Sundaram, the counsel for Cyrus Investments Pvt. Ltd and Sterling Investments Pvt. Ltd, to argue the merits of the original petition. Sundaram asked the NCLT to first clarify whether the petition was maintainable. In its response to the Mistry family firms petition, Tata Sons had said that the two firms were not qualified to file such a petition because they didnt hold enough equity under Company Act rules.Cyrus Investments and Sterling Investments together own 18.4% of the ordinary shares of Tata Sons, but only 2.17% if preference shares are included, said the holding company of the Tata group. Similarly, the Tata Trusts, which control two-thirds of Tata Sons, said that any suit filed against them needed the permission of the charity commissioner.This (equity) class of shareholders is affected and since we form 18% of the equity shareholders, the petition is maintainable and we have the right to appeal if we feel there is going to be a change in the board. Changes in the board are done through EGMs, which qualifies equity shareholders only to vote. Since we form 18% of that class, the petition is valid and maintainable, Sundaram argued.This did not work.This bench is virtually perplexed. None of the judgments of the Supreme Court or sections of the Companies Act cited by the petitioner counsel is in relation to the matter of maintainability. Moreover, normally maintainability point will be taken from the respondent side. But here the petitioner is arguing on the point of maintainability, said Prakash Kumar.The bench expressed its displeasure, saying that the Mistry family firms counsel was not cooperating with the proceedings. The tribunal said it will not spell out the judgement on maintainability separately and will hear  arguments on maintainability only as a part of the overall arguments made on the original petition. It asked Sundaram to argue on the merits of the original petition on 13 February, the next day of the hearing. After concluding hearings on behalf of the Mistry firms, the tribunal will hear Tata Sons arguments on 20 and 21 February.While agreeing to postpone the hearing from Mistrys side by two weeks, Prakash Kumar said, The petitioner counsel cant argue on the matter and is only asking for adjournment. Content in the petitioner counsels argument is a clear recusal from the direction given by the court. The meaning is that he cant and is not ready to argueThe road map was already laid out on 22 December and thereafter on 18 January. As the court earlier said, there was enough time given to the petitioner counsel. After the hearing, Sundaram told reporters that the Mistry family firms will look at other options to get a stay on the 6 February EGM.Now we may want to take other remedies against the order (the oral order allowing the EGM on 6 February) so we asked (for an) adjournment, said Sundaram.",2017-01-31,fYoDQOVgWTMiVp90MagHXM,"NCLT to next hear counsel for Cyrus Mistrys family firms on 13 February, Tata Sons on 20-21 February",23:44,"NCLT clears Tata Sons EGM on 6 Feb, asks Mistry counsel to argue first petition"
-0.13,"New Delhi: Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Thursday that his ministry was assessing the actions of former officials at Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) and upstream regulator, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), since 2007 relating to a dispute between the state-run company and Reliance Industries Ltd around flow of gas between their connected reservoirs in the Krishna-Godavari basin.
				   
				Once the assessment is completed, the ministry is expected to bring provisions to penalize energy firms for not disclosing all material information to the regulator at various stages of field development and give DGH more enforcement powers and technical expertise.Also, the ministry may take action if any individual official is found guilty of suppressing relevant information.These measures were recommended by the single-member justice A.P. Shah committee that looked into ONGCs claim that Reliance gained by producing gas from their connected reservoirs.There must be clarity on what roles the stakeholders played (relating to the dispute.) We should have transparency. We are making an internal assessment. We will bring to light whoever is responsible, Pradhan said at the economic editors conference in the capital.The Shah panel also said that the government should probe ONGCs alleged long periods of inactivity in developing the blocks awarded to it. ONGC chairman and managing director D.K. Sarraf said on 8 September that the company came to know that the reservoirs of the two companies in the KG basin were connected only in 2013, the year in which it approached the DGH on the issue. Sarraf also said then that the company had informed the Shah committee that it had no prior knowledge about flow of gas between the fields, but there was no mention of its submission in the panels report.The panel said, citing a report by DeGolyer & MacNaughton, a US-based consultancy that was hired earlier by the firms, that between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2015, about 11 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas migrated to KG D6 from adjacent fields, of which 8.9 bcm was appropriated by RIL. In a stock exchange filing on 5 November, Reliance contested the $1.5 billion claim the government made on the same day relating to the gas that seeped into its field, saying the company had worked within the boundaries of the block awarded to it and has complied with all applicable regulations and provisions of its lease.Disputes relating to natural resources do not augur well for the development of the sector.

0.3,"New Delhi: The National Democratic Alliance government on Saturday reached out to people in Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhis constituency Amethi in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, with its flagship entitlement scheme of giving cooking gas connections to the poor, called Ujjwala Yojana and assurances on skill development and employment.
				   
				Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan along with human resource development minister Prakash Javadekar and textiles minister Smriti Irani inaugurated a permanent campus for Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology (RGIPT). The central ministers also attended the distribution of 1,000 liquified petroleum gas (LPG) connections to the poor in Amethi without an upfront security deposit. Uttar Pradesh, which is going to assembly elections early next year, is a priority state for the Ujjwala scheme as LPG access to households in the state is below the national average by 7-8 percentage points. In Uttar Pradesh, electorally Indias largest state with 403 assembly seats, the Bharatiya Janata Party os looking to repeat its 2014 Lok Sabha election performance when the NDA won 73 out of the 80 seats. In Amethi, Union minister Smriti Irani had contested and lost against Rahul Gandhi during the 2014 general elections.Responding to Pradhans invitation for the launch of the campus, Rahul Gandhi in a letter said that the previous UPA government had piloted the enactment of the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology Act 2007, making the RGIPT an institute of national importance.I am happy that this historical effort of ours is moving forward. I would, however, like to bring to your notice that a number of other major development initiatives in Amethi which had either been legislated or had received cabinet approval have not progressed during the current NDA government, Gandhi said in his letter.The polls are crucial for the BJP as a win in Uttar Pradesh would bolster the chances of the partys expansion in north India. The Congress party has is also looking to revive their position where Rahul Gandhi has just completed a month long campaign. Both the regional partiesincumbent Samajwadi Party and main opposition Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Partyare eyeing the election.This is not the first time that Smriti Irani is going to Amethi for election campaign. BJP is only trying hoping that people will get distracted through these events and forget about issues like price rise, rural distress, and deteriorating law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh, said a senior Congress leader from the state.Pradhan said his government has spent Rs.302 crore in the state for completing the RGIPT project against the Rs.129 spent between 2008-14, when Congress led-United Progressive Alliance was in power. Also, in the last two years and a half, the number of LPG connections in Amethi has more than doubled to touch two lakhs, said Pradhan. In the next two years the target is to ensure 100% penetration of LPG in the district, said an oil ministry statement quoting Pradhan. The minister also said that under the scheme meant to empowering and protecting the health of women, nearly 90 Lakh LPG connections have been released since its launch on 1 May at Balia in Uttar Pradesh by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He said that the oil ministrys target is to provide LPG connections in each and every household of Uttar Pradesh.An official involved in implementing the scheme, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said so far, 31 lakh LPG connections have been issued to those below the poverty line in Uttar Pradesh under the scheme, accounting for nearly a third of all the connections issued. Three districtsAllahabad, Kushinagar and Sitapurhave been issued connections more than one lakh each.When we started the programme, the national average of LPG access was 61% of households while the same for UP was 54%. Now, the national average has improved to 68%, while that for UP has moved up to 60%. Jammu and Kashmir, being a hill state is another priority area for the scheme, said the official. So far, more than 60,000 connections have been given in Jammu and Kashmir under Ujjwala.Political analysts say that close to the polls, the central government gets an opportunity to showcase the work being done.PM Modi himself had urged people to give up their subsidies. With this one gets a sense that the subsidy is being utilized. Politically it is quite relevant and wise to hold the event in Amethi, said A.K. Verma, a Kanpur-based political analyst and political science professor at Christ Church College.So close to the polls, it is normal electoral practice to hold such events specially when there is no code of conduct in play.

0.01,"Singapore: Whats a nice round figure to take to a job interview? If the position in question is chairman of Tata group, there might be three of them: $40 billion; 2020; and 250 basis points.
				   
				Thats the value of the Indian conglomerates outstanding debt, and there are several reasons it needs to be discussed before pay and perks.For one thing, investors will hound the next chief for answers. About 90% of the Tata loans and bonds are on the books of publicly listed companies whose shareholders are nervous about the recent sacking of the groups chairman after less than four years at the helm.Market value of Tata groupCyrus Mistry has lashed out against his dismissal by warning of a possible $18 billion in asset writedowns. Discount that estimate for wounded pride, but theres no denying that some of the businesses Mistry described as legacy hot spots do have lousy credit metrics. Tata Teleservices Maharashtra Ltd.s debt exceeds 11 years of the wireless carriers earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Ditto for Tata Steel Ltd. The debt-to-Ebitda multiple at Indian Hotels Co., owner of the Taj group, is approaching eight times.Then theres the niggling issue of bunched-up repayments, the second topic toward which the aspiring chairman must steer the interview. Given that 30% of the Tata group debt originally contracted in US dollars, and more than 60% of the British-pound borrowings, will need to be repaid or refinanced in 2020, the next chairman must know from his recruiters what it is that they wish to tell international creditors about strategy before then.Much of the groups debt burden has its genesis in the optimistic expansion in the second of the two decades under Ratan Tata. To the extent his return (albeit as an interim arrangement) has ignited concerns that Mistrys attempts at deleveraging will get shelved, the new full-time boss will be expected to calm nerves. Otherwise, the loans market, which is currently treating even highly leveraged Tata companies with benign neglect, could turn anxious, especially if the ongoing war of words with Mistry casts a lingering shadow on creditor sentiment. A good place to start that uncomfortable conversation may be 250 basis points, which is the spread the group paid over Libor to raise five-year money this year for Tata Steel. For a company thats rated BB- by S&P Global Ratings, the global average for similar dollar loans this year has been 262 basis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Clearly, the 148-year-old Tata brand commands a decent premium in credit markets despite the dead weight of its European steel operations.That privilege could vanish if the bickering doesnt end. The 78-year-old Ratan Tata may have regained control of the conglomerate that bears his familys name, but Mistrys 18.4% stake in the holding company  and board seats across the group  give the 48-year-old a bully pulpit from which he can demand fire sales, especially of assets his older foe is fond of.A confrontation could get messy for the next chairman. Taking three crucial numbers into the interview wont guarantee success in what might prove to be India Inc.s most demanding open job, but making an appearance without them could be a surefire way to end up as collateral damage.

				An official involved in discussions over the policy said on condition of anonymity that the government wants more investments to flow into these fields, licensed prior to 1999, to recover the entire reserves for which an extension is necessary.The terms of extension will raise the governments take by way of an increased percentage of profit petroleumproceeds from the sale of hydrocarbon that companies share with the government. The operators of the blocks will get certainty about continued production rights to go ahead with deploying technologies to enhance output.When the Union cabinet approved a similar extension on 10 March for another set of pre-1999 fields, which unlike the ones currently under review, had hydrocarbon discoveries at the time of signing the contracts, it adopted a 10% increase in the governments take of profit petroleum. The increase applies on whatever is the governments share that is calculated as per the terms in the existing contract.The 25-year lease period for Cairn India Ltds block in Barmer, RajasthanRJ-ON-90/1expires in May 2020.

				Gail, which was forced by the oil ministry to add the Make-in-India condition to its tender, will now hire the ships from the global spot or current market to transport LNG, a senior official with knowledge of the matter said. Two Japanese biddersa consortium of Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL)-Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK Line) and Mitsui and Co. and a consortium comprising Mitsubishi Corporation-Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd (K Line) and GasLog, had sought several deviations from the tender conditions, which were not agreeable to Gail. We discussed with both the bidder the deviations they sought for over six months but when they didnt agree, we were left with no option but to cancel the tender, the official said. In the tender, Gail sought to time-charter nine newly built LNG ships of a cargo capacity of 150,000-180,000 cubic meters to LNG it has tied up from Sabine Pass and Cove Point LNG projects in US, with supplies slated to start from December 2017. Bids were sought in lots of three, with the condition that one of the three ship will be built at an Indian shipyard. The official said since Indian shipyards neither had the technology nor experience of building the highly specialised LNG ships, the bidder sought sovereign performance guarantee for the ones built in India. After postponing the deadline thrice, Gail had in February last year scrapped the tender to hire nine LNG carriers to ferry gas from the US, with a caveat that three of them be made in India. At that point, no foreign shipyard was willing to share LNG ship-building technology. Negotiations that followed saw Cochin Shipyard strike a deal with Samsung Heavy Industries Ltd to cooperate in construction of the vessels. It has also been licensed by GTT of France to build LNG carriers with the Mark III membrane containment system. However, L&T Shipbuilding, which had a deal with Hyundai Heavy Industries, has pulled out of the bidding as it turns its focus to defence projects. Pipavav Defence and Offshore Engineering has teamed up with Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering (DSME) of South Korea for ship-building. The tender was re-floated on September 15, 2015. After the deadline was postponed thrice, two consortiums put in bids on March 31 this year. The official said according to the tender condition while two ships were to be built at the shipyards of their foreign collaborators, one carrier has to be built in India. The tender document provides for the Indian shipyard taking 5-13% LNG carrier that it will build. This condition was not there in the original tender floated in 2014. Also, Gail has a right to take up to 10% equity stake in any or all of the nine ships.

0.58,"This weeks acrimonious separation between the chairman of Tata Group and its majority owners may now be heading for a divorce. Ratan Tata, who returned to head the conglomerate after ousting Cyrus Pallonji Mistry, is looking for a partner to buy the ex-chairmans stake, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.
				   
				Should Mistry agree to sell, how much can he hope to get for his familys 18.4% of Tata Sons Ltd?Bear in mind that following his dismissal, Mistry raised some very serious allegations about both the holding company and several of its biggest publicly traded units. In hitting back at the board that fired him, Mistry said the groups net worth of $26 billion could be impaired by as much as $18 billionshrinking to just $8 billionshould writedowns be needed at businesses like Tata Steel Ltds European operations; Tata Motors Ltds passenger car business (ex-Jaguar Land Rover, the jewel in the empires crown); Indian Hotels Co.s overseas Taj properties; one of Tata Power Ltd.s plants; and a floundering wireless telecom venture with NTT Docomo Inc.As a seller, Mistry is unlikely to behave anything like a spurned chairman trying to score debating points. To maximize value, he might say he overestimated the risk of Armageddon. He might even admit the possibility that Ratan Tatas return to a conglomerate he chaired for two decades will reinvigorate the operating companies. Maybe Tata cant repeat a near sevenfold increase in book value over the period 2004-2012, but if global steel demand stabilizes, theres a fair chance the groups assets could reach a book value of $28 billion after a year. In the base-case scenario, the coffee-to-cars-to-software conglomerate wont be any worse off, and its assets would be worth in 2017 what they are today: $26 billion.Now suppose that status quo has a likelihood of 50%, while the probability of a massive writedown is 20%, and that of an improvement is 30%. That gives a one-year-forward book value of $23 billion. Considering that General Electric Co. trades at three times its estimated book value for next year, and companies in the more diversified Tata Group sell at 4.8 times, Mistry could perhaps ask for a halfway-house multiple of 3.75 times, valuing his 18.4% stake at a little under $16 billion.Only a patient investor who cares more about growth than current income would be willing to write that check. After all, the dividend received from operating companies yielded just 1.6% on Tata Sons investment last year, according to the Economic Times. An investor who paid a multiple of 3.75 to relieve Mistry of his stake would earn a divided yield of 0.4%.As for Mistry himself, at $16 billion, he would walk away with an annualized 4.5% return on the $200 million loan the Tata family took from outsiders 91 years ago. Include past dividends, and he might even have matched or beaten the 9% annual return from the US stock market since 1928. Thats hardly a divorce to feel unhappy about.

				Crude futures markets roared into action, with trading accelerating as Europe joined Asia from around 0500 GMT, as Trump surprised by defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton in a series of key contests and opening a path to the White House.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell to a session low of $43.07 per barrel, down more than 4% from their last close and their lowest since September, before inching back to $43.68 a barrel at 0525 GMT.International Brent crude futures were down 2.5% at $44.87 a barrel.This is dejavu of the Brexit moment, very worrying, said Bob Takai, president at Sumitomo Corp Global Research in Tokyo, referring to Britains surprise vote to leave the European Union in a referendum last June, which led to market turmoil.The falls in oil came as prices for gold, a traditional safe haven for investors in times of high economic risk jumped, while the dollar fell sharply against a basket of other leading currencies.Investors moved into complete risk off mode...

-0.01,"Bengaluru: Tata Group chairman Cyrus Mistry has a new worry in the growing pile of troubles afflicting Indias largest conglomerate. How to revive growth at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), which accounts for 16% of the groups $103.5 billion revenue?
				   
				The troubles at Tata Motors Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd are well-documented. Despite TCS reporting a 3.7% sequential dollar revenue growth in the April-June period, the company is likely to report weak numbers in the second quarter, results of which will be declared on 13 October.Worryingly for investors, TCS now risks growing at a slower clip this year than last year, when its revenue expanded 7.1%, the slowest annual growth at TCS since 2009, when Natarajan Chandrasekaran took charge as its chief executive. TCS is expected to report an at-best 1.6% sequential dollar growth in the second quarter, according to brokerage BNP Paribas. This, on the back of 3.7% growth in the first quarter, translates into TCS doing $8.79 billion business in the first six months of the current financial year. TCS now needs more than $8.92 billion in revenue in second half of the year if it intends to grow at 7.1% this year. Simply put, TCS will need to record a better show in the October-March period this year than in the second half of last year. This certainly is a tall task as technology outsourcing firms report soft growth in the second half of the financial year.Undoubtedly, Chandrasekaran faces a tough task given the size of TCS.At the heart of TCSs slow growth is its inability to build a stronger consulting practice and reluctance to buy small firms for technologies like design consulting and automation platform providers. These tiny buyouts not just improve the current solution deliveries but also bring in growth. May be now, Mistry could nudge Chandrasekaran to start buying.With this as a backdrop, Mint puts the spotlight on five things to watch in TCSs second quarter earnings on 13 October:1. Revenue growthBrokerage BNP Paribas expects TCSs dollar revenue to rise 1.6% to $4.43 billion in the July-September period on a sequential basis. This is a big worry as this will mean that TCS needs to put forward its best foot forward in the remaining six months of the year if it wants to save itself from the humiliation of recording an even slower growth than last year. Management commentary on demand levels from its customers in Europe, after Britain voted to leave the EU, will be crucial.2. Pressure on profitability poses a double whammySince January this year, TCSs operating margins have been under pressure. TCSs 26.1% Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin at the end of March quarter was 54 basis points less than margins at the end of October-December period last year. The companys margins further contracted to 25.1% at the end of March quarter, which the management claimed to be largely on account of annual wage hikes. Now, as commoditized deals come under further pricing pressure, and TCS continues to spend money in reskilling its workforce and building digital technologies, traditional levers like going slow on hiring, will not be enough to offset the gradual decline in profitability. Analysts say that TCS is unlikely to end the current financial year with its stated guidance of 26-28%.3. What really is the problem among TCSs BFSI clients in the US?On 7 September, TCS in a mid-quarter update, said that some holding back of discretionary spending particularly in the BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance clients) vertical in the United States had led to sequential loss of momentum at the company. Is this just an one-off development or does this suggest a structural malaise? We know all IT vendors are seeing less business from big banks as these banks are spending less in application development work. Homegrown technology vendors are further seeing erosion in current revenue from the embrace of automation platforms, which is cannibalizing the existing model of billing clients on human hours. 4. Rain check of weak sectors and geographiesTCS does not expect growth to rebound in Japan. The company claims to have arrested any loss of business from its UK-based insurance platform Diligenta. Growth from telecoms segment continue to be wobbly. Together, an underperformance from the three units eroded about 2% growth from the companys 11.9% growth on constant currency basis in 2015-16. TCS needs to report some growth on a consistent basis if it has to better last years growth.5. Is higher net erosion of existing business biting into TCSs growth?During the July-September period last year, TCS claimed its order book was the strongest ever, with about 30% more than the company ever managed in any quarter. The company, however, does not disclose its order book size. Outsourcing deals are long-term contracts, and IT vendors can generate only about 3-4% of revenue from new orders in the first year, according to JPMorgan Chases George. Agreed, IT firms lose about 3-5% of current business every year, which in TCSs case, translates into a loss of about $500-825 million a year. This clearly suggest that TCS is losing more business from existing clients because even some business generated from its record order book has not offset the annual loss of business, thereby resulting in a sluggish y-o-y growth.",2016-10-12,hesaBaeP0eIEHrwSnqJO5K,TC is likely to report weak numbers in the second quarter and risks growing at a slower clip this year than last year,01:16,TCS Q2 earnings: Five things to watch for today
-0.92,"The flock of frightened pigeons that calls itself Indias telecom industry had a violent reaction recently when their regulator set a cat among them.
				   
				The impending entry of a new fourth-generation operator would anyway mean a trip to the slaughterhouse for a few of the dozen existing players, some of whom are already making a run for the coop door. But thats a known risk. Its the threat of having to cede market share to billionaire Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Jio faster than imagined thats causing nervousness.That latter possibility has been raised by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of Indias (Trai) consultation paper on scrapping the compensation one wireless service receives for calls routed to it by another.That proposal to do away with the calling-party-pays system, the incumbents allege, smacks of bias. It would give a pricing advantage to a new network like Jio, which would be more likely to originate calls than terminate them. Meanwhile, Jio has complained that existing operators are sabotaging its ongoing beta trials by not offering adequate interconnection, leading to call drops.Incumbents have denied the allegation, and accused Ambani of running a service in the garb of testing. The dispute is fast turning into just the kind of melee the government, looking to hold its biggest-ever auction of spectrum a little more than a month from now, can ill afford.Also Read: Reliance Jio vs the rest: Trai, PMO dragged into the fightTo the extent the fracas is the harbinger of a bruising price war, its also bad news for shareholders of Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular, which together with Vodafone control more than three-fifths of the market. The quest to expand data usage on their networks ahead of Jios long-delayed entry has already caused prices to head south:While data usage is indeed picking up, capital expenditure is accelerating. Ideas net debt is almost 5.7 times annual earnings before interest and taxes (Ebit); its 3.3 times Ebit for Bharti. With Reliance boasting to the regulator that its $20 billion investment in Jio is already more than any of its competitors, incumbents have little breathing room.When Kumar Mangalam Birla, Idea Cellulars controlling shareholder, sought to streamline his fiber-to-finance empire, minority shareholders balked at the prospect of being asked to fund his money-guzzling telecom venture. Ambani, on the other hand, has been lucky. His petroleum-refining business is minting cash, so creditors are giving him the chips to spin the roulette wheel and grab those 100 million Reliance Jio subscribers he craves.The stakes are high, and so are anxiety levels. With the regulator adding to the uncertainty about future market share, investors can expect more volatility. Idea Cellulars shares jumped as much as 7.9% on Tuesday before the company said media speculation about a sale to Vodafone is untrue and preposterous.The fluttering has begun.

0.4,"Tata Sons Ltds failure to communicate with stakeholders to explain the trust deficit that it said had prompted Cyrus Mistrys ouster last month has reinforced a perception of opacity around the exit, proxy advisory firms and investors said on Tuesday.
				   
				In a research note released on Tuesday, Institutional Investor Advisory Service (IiAS) said independent directors of listed Tata group companies must provide comprehensive guidance to shareholders on whether Mistry should remain chairman of these firms.And, if boards of the listed companies are divided in their support of Mistry, there is a risk of the boards becoming dysfunctional, IiAS warned.On 27 October, three days after deciding to replace Mistry, Tata Sons released a statement in which it said: The Directors of the Tata Sons board had repeatedly raised queries and concerns on certain business issues, and Trustees of the Tata Trusts were increasingly getting concerned with the growing trust deficit with Mr. Mistry, but these were not being addressed. The Tata Sons board, in its collective wisdom, took the decision to replace its chairman in the manner undertaken.Tata Trusts are the single-largest shareholders in Tata Sons.The holding company has not elaborated on the trust deficit, and Tata Sons board is effectively asking investors to blindly trust it, IiAS said.In the research note, IiAS said it was important for Tata Sons to communicate to its companies boards the rationale to dethrone Cyrus Mistry. Tata Sons can begin by sharing the details of the board evaluation, and the process it followed to conclude that Mistry must be unseated, it said.With public perception veering towards Cyrus Mistry, the Tata group needs to provide factual and cohesive information supporting its decision to balance the discourse. Else it must back down, it added.A top official at a mutual fund company that is invested in various Tata group firms said: The process and the way it has been done is not to our liking, it could have been done in a much better way.On the day Tata Sons announced Mistrys removal, this official, who didnt want to be named, said he received two emails from Mistrys officeone an invitation to attend Tata Day, the global investor meet scheduled for 18 November, and the second to attend an event on 13 December to announce the formation of an investment trust that was to be formed between the Tata Group, BlackRock, McKinsey & Co and other firms to promote long-term investment in the Tata group companies.Both the events have now been rescheduled for next year.Independent directors of Indian Hotels Co. Ltd, which runs the Taj group, have backed Mistry, reposing their confidence in his leadership.State-owned Life Insurance Corp. of India (LIC), which has a significant stake in several Tata group firms, is also likely to back Mistry, said a person aware of the situation, who didnt want to be identified.If theres a resolution to vote for removal of Mistry, LIC may vote against it, he said.In response to questions on the IiAs note and how the company plans to justify the action taken a fortnight ago, a Tata group spokesperson said, These are subjective views of different profiles. Tata Sons on 24 October had said that the board in its collective wisdom and the recommendation of its principal shareholders decided that it may be appropriate in the long-term interest of the Tata Sons and Tata group to replace Mr Mistry. Independent directors have a right to a point of view, he said.The board of directors of Tata Chemicals Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd are set to meet on 10, 11 and 14 November, respectively, to discuss the companies September quarter earnings. It is not clear if the independent directors are  likely to meet ahead of  the quarterly earnings to discuss Mistrys board position.There will obviously be a resolution and it will be taken to a logical conclusion, whatever that may be, said a Tata group official, who declined to be identified.To pass a resolution supporting the removal of Cyrus Mistry as director with a 51% majority, the Tata group will need shareholders supportit only owns about 30-35% of equity in the listed companies of the group other than Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.Amit Tandon, founder and managing director at IiAs, said given the current complexity, going forward, the chain of command becomes very critical among the different entities within the Tata Groupthe Tata Trusts, Tata Sons and the operating companies.Ami Shah and Anirudh Laskar in Mumbai contributed to this story.",2016-11-09,iZlkEZyxqm4Yrh4907wN4J,"Tata group has to provide credible facts that necessitated former chairman Cyrus Mistrys ouster, say proxy advisory firms",01:21,Is trust deficit widening on Tatas narrative on Cyrus Mistry?
0.54,"Bangalore/Mumbai: Amid the carnage on Wall Street in 2008, as Bank of America Corp. was trying to forge its rushed merger with Merrill Lynch & Co., Natarajan Chandrasekaran boarded a plane for New York to try to reassure the two financial behemoths that an Indian IT company could make the systems of their strikingly different cultures work together.
				   
				Chandrasekaran, known as Chandra, was then chief operating officer of Asias largest IT services exporter, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS). Over the following weeks he fended off global rivals who smelled an opportunity to muscle in, and set about integrating the banks systems and assuaging the new managements anxieties about outsourcing to a foreign supplier. TCS kept the business and grew it substantially.Last week, Chandra, now chief executive officer of TCS, was chosen for an even more fraught diplomatic task: to resurrect the image and fortunes of the Tata Group, Indias biggest conglomerate, which has been racked by losses at some of its biggest units, and by a boardroom battle that has threatened to turn the workings of the venerable corporation into a media soap-opera.Tata Sons, the group holding company, named Chandra, 53, as chairman, taking over on 21 February from interim chairman Ratan Tata. Tata, 79, had run the family business for more than two decades before handing over in 2012 to his hand-picked successor, Cyrus Mistry. In October, Tata Sons shocked Indias corporate community by firing Mistry, reinstalling Ratan Tata and promising to find a replacement by March. Chandra was a front runner for the job, a Tata employee almost all his working life, who grew TCS into the conglomerates most successful business, with about $16 billion in sales.Yet he is both an insider and an outsider. While he has been with the group since joining as an intern three decades ago, he is the first chairman who is not a Parsi, the shrinking ethnic group of Zoroastrians that boasts a disproportionately high number of Indias business elite. He is only the third person without the Tata name to get the job, and the first without a close family tie to the Tatas.IT CareerMoreover, his career and success has all been with TCS, virtually an island within the group that serves many of the worlds top corporations with a young, skilled, technical workforce. As head of Tata Sons, he will be responsible for a conglomerate that assembles buses in Zambia, serves prawn kalimiri to diners at its Bombay Brasserie in London, sells salt to Indian families at Rs18(27 cents) a kilo, and runs hundreds of other businesses across the world.He served both TCS and the customer commendably during the BofA-ML merger. Now he has the chance to build a positive organization by bonding together various companies and their half-a-million plus employees, said S. Ramadorai, the previous CEO of TCS. He is non-confrontational and, at the same time, does not foolishly ignore problems.Chandras appointment came after TCS announced it had made the equivalent of $1 billion in quarterly profit for the first time. Tatas star unit accounts for over half of the groups market value.A five-man panel unanimously chose Chandra from a list of more than a dozen candidates. He stood out both within the group and outside, said former bureaucrat Vijay Singh, a non-executive director on the board of Tata Sons, which ratified the selection. A Tata Sons statement said Chandra would uphold the groups values and adhere to its high standard of practicesthings the board previously accused Mistry of failing to do.We are at an inflection point, said Chandra in a statement after his appointment. I am aware that this role comes with huge responsibilities. It will be my endeavor to help progress the group with the ethos, ethics and values that the Tata group has been built on. Chandra declined an interview request for this story.Steel lossesFacing him is a menu of corporate issues, including the money-losing UK operations of Tata Steel Ltd., the overhang from failed ambitions like Tata Motors Ltd.s cheap Nano car, debt-ridden Indian Hotels Co., and a $1.17 billion arbitration battle with telecom partner NTT Docomo Inc. Mistry has previously defended his time as chairman, when he tried to reduce debt built up during a series of global acquisitions by Ratan Tata. In an e-mail to directors after his dismissal, Mistry said the group may face Rs1.18 trillion in writedowns over time because of  legacy hotspots he inherited.Mistry, whose family owns an 18% stake in Tata Sons, filed a case with the National Company Law Tribunal seeking the appointment of an administrator to oversee the companys affairs, a forensic audit and a probe into the role of the trustees of Tata trusts, the majority shareholders of Tata Sons. Hes asked for Ratan Tata, head of the trusts, to be restrained from attending board meetings. A spokesman for Mistry said he would not comment as the matter is subject to the legal proceedings.Investors expect Chandra to act quickly to resolve governance issues, said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director at proxy advisory firm InGovern Research Services Pvt. Key to his success will be how he handles Ratan Tata, who has indicated that he may step down as chairman of the trusts this year. Tata instigated the Nano project, a troubled airline venture and many of the other expansions that are now draining the groups resources.Tata congratulated Chandra on Twitter, saying he was sure the new chairman would protect the groups values and ethics. A Tata Group spokesman declined to comment.Chandra is an optimist, he thinks big and will go after positive outcomes in the new job, said Krishnakumar N., executive chairman of rival Indian IT services company Mindtree Ltd.The son of a farmer in rural southern India, Chandra studied in a Tamil-language school rather than gaining the English-language education favored by the middle class.He joined TCS in 1987 after completing a masters in Computer Applications from Regional Engineering College, Trichy, Tamil Nadu. His leadership talent was spotted by Ramadorai in 1993 when Chandra was praised by customer International Business Machines Corp. He was put in charge of a major project for British Telecommunications Plc. When Ramadorai became TCSs CEO, he chose Chandra as his executive assistant.He loved meeting customers, and it was never a Hi-How-Are-You? kind of a meeting, Ramadorai said in a telephone interview. He put the client at the center of the universe, made every conversation count and nurtured clients like American Express.Young CEOChandra took over as chief executive of TCS in 2009 at the age of 46. Over the next seven years, he would triple the IT companys share price and revenue and more than double its headcount.As Chandras corporate universe expanded, so did his interests, according to colleagues. Hes fond of photography and classical music, but his real passion is running. He has run marathons in Boston, Chicago, Berlin, New York, Tokyo and other cities.Being a runner has greatly shaped my thinking as a leader, Chandra told Runners World in October 2015. You have to decide on the length of the engagement, develop endurance to handle setbacks and increase speed when the competition demands it. You have to perform with your heart and your mind.At TCS, Chandra backed new technologies from cloud to mobile and evangelized to global corporations about digital disruption, always with a reputation for building close relationships with clients. Som Mittal, former head of Hewlett-Packard Co.s India operations, worked with Chandra for years in the software-industry trade body Nasscom and said if he texted Chandra, hed get a call back within 20 minutes.Whether he was preparing for a marathon in London or stepping into a client meeting in New York, he unfailingly called back, no matter what timezone and which corner of the globe he was in, said Mittal. He was also an inveterate traveler who would fly to client meetings even for the smallest deals. He has this uncanny ability of making everyone think they are his dearest friends.Chandra drove projects at TCS that dispersed the chaotic crowds and touts that used to clog the entrances of Indias passport offices and its best-known hospital, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi. He charted new territories for TCS in Latin America and Japan by hiring local talent.His new role comes with a different set of challenges. He will have to stabilize the group and plan a decade or two into the groups future, said Ramadorai. It is a rough road.Looming over him will be the presence of a family that has been royalty in Indias business world for more than a century, and the scion of that family, Ratan Tata.Chandra is not afraid to express opinion and can be extremely firm when he is convinced about something, said Mittal. He is no pushover. Bloomberg",2017-01-16,icSPfNFcGFeEX4LWRyqbnM,Natarajan Chandrasekaran  will take over as chairman of Tata Sons from interim chief Ratan Tata on 21 February ,12:30,N.

				A stronger US dollar also weighed as the currency surge made it more expensive to hold dollar-denominated commodities. Brent crude futures were down $1.01, or 1.8%, at $56.09 a barrel at 3.36pm. US crude futures were trading at $52.99 per barrel, down $1, or 1.85%.We see the optimism surrounding Opec and non-Opec production cuts being counterbalanced by fears of higher US crude production as the higher rig count of last Friday still weighs, said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro.Last week, US energy companies added oil rigs for a tenth week in a row, Baker Hughes data showed, extending a recovery in activity into an eighth month as crude prices remained at levels at which many drillers can operate profitably.This raised concerns that US production is increasing and undermining efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and others to cut output.Rising exports from Iran also added to bearish sentiment. Iran has sold more than 13 million barrels of oil held on tankers at sea, capitalising on its exemption from a global deal to cut production in order to regain market share and court new buyers.In Iraq, Opecs second-biggest producer, a record 3.51 million barrels per day (bpd) were exported from its port in Basra in December, officials said, although they added that the country would comply with its commitment to lower output by an average of 210,000 bpd from January.On the other hand, Russia, one of the worlds largest crude producers, appeared to be sticking to the agreement to cut as Russian energy market sources told Reuters the countrys output had slipped in the first week of the month.Oil and gas condensate output averaged 11.1 million bpd from 1 January to 8 January, down from Octobers 11.247 million bpd.

				RGPPL, which runs the Dabhol power plant and LNG terminal in Ratnagiri district, now receives cargoes only between October and May, due to lack of a breakwater to protect vessels from choppy seas during the monsoon months. The company plans to build a breakwater facility at a cost of Rs800 crore, and is currently de-merging its power and LNG businesses into separate entities. RGPPL is owned by NTPC Ltd and Gail (India) Ltd with both holding 25.51% stake each while financial institutions hold 35.47% and Maharashtra State Electricity Board holds 13.51%.Raising funds for the breakwater facility seems difficult right now, said a Gail (India) official, one of the two people cited above, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  We have thus decided that after the demerger, which is under way, we will have a separate business plan for the LNG terminal.

0.48,"Mumbai: Shareholders of Tata Motors Ltd voted on a resolution on Thursday to remove Nusli Wadia as a director at the companys extraordinary general meeting (EGM).
				   
				Though the voting results were not released at the time of going to press, the odds seemed to be  stacked against the industrialist who has been a director on the Tata Motors board for more than 18 years, if the number of shareholders who spoke in favour of the resolution seeking his removal was any indication. Tata Sons, the Tata group holding company, in November sought the removal of Wadia as director of Tata Steel, Tata Motors and Tata Chemicals. Tata Sons controls 26.51% of Tata Motors, 29.75% of Tata Steel and 19.35% of Tata Chemicals.ALSO READ | Nusli Wadia removed as Tata Steel directorEarlier this month, Wadia filed a Rs3,000 crore defamation suit against Ratan Tata and the board of Tata Sons.Global proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (ISS) questioned the rationale behind resolution to seek removal of Wadia, an independent director at three Tata companies. Proxy advisory firm Stakeholder Empowerment Services (SES) on the other hand, recommended shareholders of Tata Steel, Tata Motors and Tata Chemicals to vote in favour of a resolution to remove him. Both developments happened earlier this month.Sixty-three people spoke at the EGM; most spoke in favour of the resolution.Before the meeting, Wadia, who did not attend the EGM, had made his case to the companys shareholders in a letter. Wadia said he had chosen not to attend, calling the recent EGMs as inappropriately and shamefully stage-managed.Wadia, 72, was removed as an independent director from the board of Tata Steel Ltd late on Wednesday with a majority of both institutional and retail investors voting against him at an EGM. On Friday, he will face a similar test at an EGM called by Tata Chemicals Ltd to remove him.Wadias four-page letter to Tata Motors shareholders, dated 21 December, spoke of attempts by Tata Sons to influence independent directors and the board of Tata Motors through unsigned legal opinions. These opinions, he said, were circulated just hours before a company board meeting to influence, intimidate and muzzle the independent directors from communicating with the stock exchanges.He wrote about the companys ill-conceived investments in low-cost passenger car Nano and the delay in its closure leading to a serious drain on the finances of the company. Wadia said every sale of Nano was at a substantial loss to Tata Motors, with total losses on Nano running into thousands of crores.Wadia also wrote about cross-holdings in Tata companies, the largest of which, he said, was Tata Sons valued at Rs8,600 crore.Wadia said the cross-holdings were being held in Tata Motors, a debt-ridden company, to keep voting control over Tata Sons. The listed companies as a whole have blocked approximately Rs70,000 crore in holding Tata Sons shares equivalent to 14% of its capital with the sole purpose of shoring up the voting rights of the (Tata) Trust(s).It is for you the shareholders of Tata Motors who own 70% of the shares of your company to decide whether you want to be the holder of Tata Sons shares with minimum return, zero liquidity and no exit, he wrote.Wadia said it was the first time in Tata Motors history that a productivity-linked settlement was agreed, initiated and was to be signed with the union in Pune after 14 months of discussion, but Ratan Tata met the union and asked them to support the change in leadership. The union subsequently issued a statement that their relationship with the management of the company had taken a downward trend over the issues. This irresponsible action galvanizing and acting prejudicially against the interest of your company may jeopardise its future and impact the overall morale of all the workers and employees of Tata Motors. The letter also pointed to the impact on the passenger vehicle business due to issues in design, product, quality, execution and high costs being directed from the top. The division has high capital employed, high level of loss that impacts overall financials of the company, he wrote. What is at stake now is not whether I am removed or not, but the fate of the very institution of the independent director that has been created in law and by Sebi (capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India) to safeguard the interests of all stakeholders, the letter said.On Wednesday, Wadia had said that the ability of promoter Tata Sons to seek removal of independent directors from group company boards could force them to either toe the line, resign or face removal.",2016-12-22,jFgUgkZQ86jpARNXaZ6grJ,"A number of shareholders, at the Tata Motors EGM, spoke in favour of the resolution seeking Nusli Wadias removal was any indication",11:29,Odds stacked against Nusli Wadia at Tata Motors EGM

He will also have the support of Ratan Tata who is unlikely to give him the kind of free hand he gave Mistry.

				In his budget speech, Jaitley said full electrification of 18,452 villages identified in 2015 will be achieved by 1 March 2018, for which Rs4,814 crore will be spent in the next financial year, a 43%jump from what is estimated to have spent this fiscal. Of this, so far, close to 12,000 villages have been electrified.Jaitly announced setting up of 20 GW of solar power capacity and feeding 7,000 railway stations with solar power, giving a major impetus to the shift to clean energy. Over the last two years, the share of solar power in the countys energy mix has been gradually increasing, while that of thermal power has been declining. As on 31 December, thermal power capacity accounts for 69% of the countrys 310 gigawatt (GW) power generation capacity, while solar power account for 2.7%.Also read:Union Budget 2017: Key highlightsSolar energy, with the help of government policies and the falling global prices, is now at an inflection point where it can compete on its own against other forms of energy, said Sanjeev Aggarwal, managing director and chief executive of Amplus Energy Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Two new strategic oil reserves announced will be built in Odisha and Rajasthan, Jaitley said. India has already built underground crude oil storage capacities at three locationsVishakhapatnam, Mangalore and Padur with a total 5.3 million tonne capacity. The facility at Vishakhapatnam has already been filled up and half of the Mangalore storage facility has been filled. India in January signed a deal with the United Arab Emirates for filling the rest of the facility at Mangalore. The idea is to have enough oil reserves in case of any disruption in crude oil supplies to the country in the event of any geopolitical tension. Oil refiners like Indian Oil Corp. have inventory sufficient to meet three weeks of demand. Jaitley also cut import duty on LNG from 5% to 2.5% and on solar tempered glass that goes into manufacturing of solar cells, panels and modules from 5% to zero. Also, materials that go into making such glass will now attract countervailing duty at 6% compared to 12.5% earlier.

0.97,"Moscow/London: Two years ago, the Kremlins oil flagship was foundering, hit by falling prices and international sanctions just as it faced $20 billion in debt payments.
				   
				Short of cash, Rosneft got about $15 billion of emergency aid with help from the central bank. But the deal spooked investors, requiring a massive rate increase to stem market turmoil. Chief executive officer Igor Sechin, the man Vladimir Putin had for a decade relied on to build Rosneft into a giant, faced rare disfavour from his patron, senior officials said at the time.Now, Putin is turning to Rosneft for help. Sechins energy colossus is helping fill a yawning budget gap at home and support the Kremlin abroad. The companys turnaround is a triumph for the Russian president, who vowed to protect the pillars of his state-dominated system from US and European Union pressure when they were slapped with sanctions two years ago.Russia is among dozens of petro-states that are learning to make do with less as oil prices show no signs of major recovery. For some, like Saudi Arabia, the rout has provided an added impetus for economic overhauls, while othersincluding Putins Russiathe priority has been to paper over cracks with short-term fixes that dont reduce their reliance on petroleum.Also Read: Rosneft buy of Bashneft gives impetus to privatization: Vladimir PutinIts very important to the Kremlin that Rosneft is a strong company, said James Henderson, a former banker who is now a senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. Russias foreign policy as much as domestic policy relies on it.Shopping spreeJust last week, Rosneft spent 330 billion rubles ($5 billion) to buy control of another oil company from the government, the biggest privatization deal yet this year. Then Putin backed a plan under which Rosneft could provide an even bigger cash infusion, spending as much as $11 billion to buy a chunk of its own shares from the government. On 15 October, it announced a deal to buy a big refinery and other assets in India, under which it will pay $3.5 billion for a 49% stake. Putin presided over the signing of that agreement on a visit to Goa, confirming that Rosneft remains a favoured Kremlin tool for binding political ties with business links.Even Putin seemed surprised at Rosnefts recovery. At a meeting with budget officials, he said hed instructed the appropriate agencies to check that Rosneft had the funds on its accounts and wouldnt need to borrow to make the payments to the government.The Kremlin, too, has managed to weather the worst of the pain so far, thanks to billions in petrodollars saved up when oil prices were high, the sharp devaluation of the ruble and help from China and other friends outside the West. His economy steadying, Putin shows no sign of softening his confrontational approach to the US and Europe. Hes pushing his advantage in Syria, moving new missiles to Europes borders and, according to US intelligence, deploying hackers to meddle in the presidential elections.The key to Rosnefts turnaroundeven as oil prices have languishedwas a combination of financial engineering, the weakened ruble, political support and a little help from some friends: billions of dollars in advance payments from buyers in China. Rosnefts cash pile stood at more than $22 billion at the end of the second quarter, almost double what it had early last year.A Rosneft spokesman didnt respond to a request for comment for this article.Once an also-ran made up of the scraps of the Soviet oil industry that the 1990s oligarchs didnt want, Rosnefts fortunes turned as Putin moved to restore Kremlin control of the strategic sector in the early 2000s. He installed fellow intelligence veteran Sechin to lead the company in 2004. Rosneft took over the bulk of Yukos, a company the government seized from Putin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky. In 2013 Rosneft became the largest publicly traded oil producer on the planet when it purchased TNK-BP, a venture of the British company and a trio of Russian billionaires, for more than $50 billion. It borrowed more than $30 billion for that deal, one of the largest-ever financings by a Russian company.But soon after the TNK-BP deal, Rosnefts proximity to Putin became a liability.Also Read: Will Rosneft deal benefit Essar Oil shareholders?Eager to hit the Russian leader in his pocketbook after the March 2014 annexation of Crimea, the US announced sanctions targeting Sechin, citing his utter loyalty to Vladimir Putin. Later, the US and EU slapped limits on Rosneft, restricting access to technology and capital markets. Igor sanctionForeign lenders whod once battled for Rosnefts favour couldnt do business with it. BPs CEO joked that Sechins new nickname was Igor Sanction.By that fall, Rosneft was again walloped as oil fell below $100. Soon, it was asking the Kremlin for a $43 billion rescue. Putin balked at the huge sum, which was nearly as big as the bailouts the largest US banks got back in 2009 and would have used up much of one of Russias two sovereign wealth funds.The crisis of 2014 made investors panic, said Oleg Popov, a Moscow money manager who owns Rosnefts bonds. It was a perfect storm.But just days before a $7 billion payment to western banks came due in December 2014, Rosneft got its lifeline. Through a complicated series of transactions that stretched over several months, it issued 1 trillion rubles in bonds that a local bank used as collateral to borrow as much as $15 billion from the Russian central bank to lend on to the oil giant. The state bank that came up with the scheme couldnt participate because of sanctions, so Rosneft took the idea to another lender, according to a person familiar with the deals. Apparently fearful the US could extend the restrictions to squeeze the institution involved, Rosneft kept the nature of the deal a secret.But when word of the bond issue leaked out, its huge size alarmed local investors, who dumped the ruble.Only an emergency 6.5-percentage-point rate hike and heavy Kremlin pressure on exporters to sell foreign currency were enough to stabilize the exchange rate. Sechin publicly denied any role in the rubles plunge, threatening to deal with provocateurs who alleged the company was involved. Rosnefts London-traded shares dropped to the lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis.Putin criticismThe botched bailout angered top officials including Putin, people familiar with the situation said at the time. Sechin faced a rare public criticism from the president in a late-night meeting. A prominent Moscow newspaper editor tweeted that rumors were swirling among the capitals elite gathered at the Bolshoi Theater for a ballet premiere that Sechin was about to be fired. Rosneft denied it.Sechin tried to make amends, selling tens of billions of dollars earned from oil sales to buy rubles, helping steady the currency. He cut capital spending. To raise cash, the company pitched stakes in major Siberian projects to investors in China and India.The plunging ruble became a blessing, lowering Rosnefts costs in dollar terms and cushioning the blow of low oil prices, since crude is sold in dollars. A fifty-dollar barrel is worth 53% more, in ruble terms, today than it was two years ago.Also Read: Essar Oil-Rosneft deal likely to escape capital gains tax due to Mauritius treatyFurther relief came when customersnever publicly identified by Rosneft, but assumed by analysts to be led by state-controlled China National Petroleum Corp.made $15 billion in prepayments for future crude supplies in the third quarter of 2015. By early this year, Sechin had reclaimed his traditional position in Putins good books, touting Rosnefts results in a personal meeting with the leader. He also installed a veteran executive whod built up government connections during a stint as a deputy energy minister, Pavel Fedorov, as his de-facto No. 2.Rosnefts market capitalization topped that of Gazprom, the state gas monopoly and its traditional rival for political affections, for the first time in April. BP, which owns a 20% stake in Rosneft, reported that its share of the Russian companys profits last year contributed almost a quarter of its earnings, the largest share ever. In June, Sechin said he thought his company could be worth as much as $130 billion, twice its current value and more than BP. Crude production would be up after several years of declines, he said.By accidentOver the last year, we cut our debt load in half, he told state television. For a company like ours thats under sanctions, thats a brilliant result, he added. Topping the market-capitalization ranks of Russian companies just happened by accident, he said with a smile.Still, investors have cause for skepticism. In its presentations, Rosneft doesnt count the billions of dollars of pre-payments as debt. Rating agencies believe it should, since the company has to repay them, with interest, in oil. When the prepayments are included, Rosneft had reduced its net debt since 2013 by only about $6 billion as of the end of the second quarter, according to Alexey Bulgakov, an analyst at Sberbank-CIB in Moscow. That compares with the companys claim to have cut net debt by more than $22 billion over the period.S&P Global Ratings this month called Rosnefts financial policy aggressive, warning that future acquisitions could lead debt to spike.The company faces as much as $16 billion in debt repayments before the end of next year, including the bulk of the central-bank facility, which the regulator is eager to see repaid, according to officials. At the same time, Rosneft still is pumping money into projects in Venezuela, where the business outlook is murky at best but the Kremlin is eager to maintain political ties.Goldman Sachs this week cut Rosneft shares to neutral from buy, warning that the company could start diverting its cash to value-eroding M&A.Political controlEven Rosnefts plan to buy its own shares is in part a reflection of weakness. The government efforts to find other buyers for the 19.5% stake it wants to unload have fallen flat, leaving Rosneft itself as the acquirer of last resort. Real privatization would happen at a later date, with Rosneft reselling it to unspecified outside investors at higher prices, Putin told reporters on the trip to India last weekend. On that visit, a jacket-less Sechin was sighted playing pool with the head of a state bank during a break in the talks. (Sechin won.)Concerns about the giant companys efficiency were among the reasons Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and senior members of his cabinet cited in opposing Rosnefts bid for Bashneft, the company Rosneft bought in the privatization this month. They argued the sale should be used to boost the private sector. But Rosneft offered as much as $1 billion more than rival bidders and after months of mixed signals, Putin ruled against his officials, saying he was a bit surprised theyd ever been opposed.The current leadership believes that political control is more important than market efficiency, said Edward Chow, a former Chevron executive who is now a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

0.63,"Singapore: Monday evenings coup at Bombay House, the headquarters of Indias steel-to-software conglomerate Tata, was as swift as it was abrupt.
				   
				Not only did the board of Tata Sons, the holding company, dump Cyrus Mistry as chairman after less than four years, it also brought back Ratan Tata, 78, as the interim boss, leaving nobody in any doubt that the founding family of the 148-year-old empire was reasserting control.But what made Tata reach for the nuclear option?The companys brief statement gave no clues, though conspiracy theories range from Mistrys futile attempts at micro-managing a maddening potpourri of companies, to not having a nose for talent (a six-member executive council put together by him was also disbanded), and selling the family silver to pay down debt when he should have focused more on growth.Investors in Tatas suite of operating companies were picking up signs of discord, but were still unprepared for a coup. After all, Ratan Tata seemed to be nothing less than delighted when a selection committee tasked to find his successor returned from a 15-month global hunt with the idea that Mistry  a member of the search panel as well as the son of a large shareholder  was the best choice. If the 48-year-old executive is now being removed for being out of his depth, the more experienced Ratan Tata deserves some blame for putting him in that position in the first place.Also Read: Understanding the Tata Sons boardroom coupBesides, its not clear that Mistry was doing a lousy job. Start the clock in late August 2004, when the IPO of software business Tata Consultancy created the group as it exists today. In the subsequent eight years that Tata guided the behemoth, a market capitalization-weighted index of its 26 listed units barely managed to beat the Sensex. Over a shorter time frame, Mistry has outperformed the benchmark more convincingly.When it comes to future returns, though, Ratan Tata may have reasons to be anxious about the direction in which Mistry was steering the ship.Tata took advantage of a China-fueled boom in commodity demand to load up on debt, which led to an eightfold expansion in the annual net income of the groups publicly traded companies in the six years through 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But with overcapacity in the Peoples Republic hitting the groups steel business hard, profitability waned.In wanting to reduce leverage by selling everything from money-losing UK steel operations to coal mines in Indonesia and hotels in the US, Mistry has veered too far away from his predecessors expansionist strategy. With the pace of capital expenditure down to a 12-month run rate of $2 billion versus $3.7 billion in Tatas final year at the helm, the group runs the risk of courting irrelevance. Also Read: Cyrus Mistry ouster could slow Tata groups debt reduction processMore worrisome, from a Tata perspective, is that the group nowadays makes news mostly for the wrong reasons. Whether its an almost $1 billion jury award against its software unit for a US intellectual-property infringement case, or the embarrassment of losing a $1.17 arbitration brought against Tata Sons by NTT Docomo for alleged failure to honour a partnership contract, the conglomerates reputation for good corporate citizenship has taken a beating.Its hard to say if Mondays putsch will fix everything from strategic wobbles to PR snafus. Investors will want to see if the mutiny leads to a bounty in the form of superior shareholder returns. That depends mainly on whether the search panel gets lucky this time around. Pending the induction of the new chairman, however, what matters is how operating companies  and their bosses  react to Ratan Tatas return.For now, palace intrigue looks unlikely to affect performance. Tata group investors should worry if that were to change.

0.46,"Mumbai: Tata Motors Ltd, which had launched the countrys first compressed natural gas (CNG) bus fleet, is planning to commercially roll out eco-friendly liquefied natural gas (LNG) bus by April next year. 
				   
				The company had made a pilot-run for the nations first LNG powered bus in Thiruvananthapuram last week and hopes to launch first in Kerala. The company had unveiled the first LNG truck at the Delhi Auto Expo 2014. If all goes well, we are planning the commercial launch next April. We are working overtime to get regulatory approvals including those from Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), Tata Motors engineering head Ajit Jindal said. He, however, denied the plans that the company has inked an agreement with Kerala. We have not signed any agreement with Kerala as yet or any other state. Kerala is keen to place an order for 1,000 buses with us and we have offered to make 10% of that (100) to be LNG-powered, Jindal said. He said these fully-built buses will be produced at its Lucknow plant, where it makes the CNG buses also, and the body will be built at its Dharwar plant. Going forward, if the demand is good, we can also offer just chassis, he said. When asked about the advantages of LNG over CNG in terms ownership cost for a customer, he said there is no significant cost advantage over CNG, but coastal states can gain considerably from fuel transportation cost. From the point of view of diesel, the gains are huge as cost of ownership will be cheaper by around 30%, while acquisition cost may be higher by Rs4-5 lakh, he added. In terms of ease of usage, the LNG buses offer a great advantage over CNG variants as the dead weight of a CNG cylinder and that of a cryogenic cylinder is huge apart from very low filling time, he said. With a full tank, an LNG bus can run as much as 700 km in one filling, while a CNG bus can at best deliver just about 200 km per cylinder, Jindal said. He also said an LNG-powered bus (Tata LPO1613) is lighter in weight compared to buses powered by conventional fuels and has enhanced levels of payload.Jindal said they have not spent too much on developing this bus which will be sold initially as fully built units of 9 meters or 35 seaters, and 12 meters or 50 seaters, the engines are same as that of its CNG buses. About fuel supply, Jindal said the company is talking to Petronet LNG Ltd and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd to set up special filling stations. But again, he said, no agreement has been reached between them. From the emission side, LNG being a cleaner fuel can reduce greenhouse gases by 30% than diesel.

1.0,"Mumbai: Energy giant Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) on Monday reported a 3.6% year-on-year increase in consolidated third-quarter net profit, benefiting from higher refining and petrochemical margins.
				   
				Consolidated net profit in the three months ended 31 December rose to Rs7,506 crore from Rs7,245 crore a year ago. Consolidated revenue rose 16.2% from a year ago to Rs84,189 crore.Earnings were boosted by a 12% increase in so-called other income, or income thats generated from avenues other than its main businesses, to Rs2,736 crore in the December quarter.The refining business has delivered eight consecutive quarters of double-digit GRMs (gross refining margins), benefitting from the global demand for transportation fuels and improved product cracks, said Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director.ALSO READ | Reliance Jio to add $4.4 bn in funding as Mukesh Ambani builds war chestGRM, or what the company earns from turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel, widened to $10.8 per barrel compared to $10.1 in the September quarter. Analysts had expected RILs GRM to be between $10.5 per barrel and $11.5 per barrel. During the quarter, the benchmark Singapore complex margin increased by $1.5 per barrel sequentially to $6.7 per barrel. RILs revenue from the refining segment was up at 7.5% at Rs61,693 crore.RIL is the operator of the worlds biggest oil-refinery complex with a refining capacity of 1.24 million barrels of oil per day, located at Jamnagar in Gujarat.The companys petrochemicals business sprang a surprise. Analysts had expected the segment to show weaker numbers on the back of falling margins and demonetization.Segment revenue in the petrochemicals business grew 17.8% to Rs22,584 crore. Earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) grew faster at 25.5%. As a result, the petrochemical margin was a better-than-expected 14.4%, up 80 basis points from a year ago.

0.1,"It is Make in India week in Mumbai and the buzz in the city is all about getting more foreign direct investment and boosting exports. But with overseas demand in the dumps, the latest trade data makes for dreary reading. Even after accounting for lower commodity prices, and adjusting for oil and gold trade.
				   
				Take non-petroleum product exports. In January, these totalled $19.12 billion, about 10.5% down from a year ago. Several manufactured goods industries reported this decline. Engineering goods exports fell by more than a quarter, textiles by 6.1% and leather by 12.1%. To be sure, lack of demand and deflation worldwide is one reason for this sharp fall. However, calculations by Sonal Varma and Neha Saraf, economists at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd, show that volumes fell 0.4% in January after falling 0.2% in December.Import data doesnt show a better picture either. Imports of capital goods, which are usually a sign of investment demand recovery, fell in many categories. Transport equipment imports fell 21.1% and project goods fell similarly. Overall, non-oil non-gold imports, a signal for domestic demand, fell 7.5% from a year ago in January.While this fall in imports is totally in pricing terms that is, volume growth is still in positive territoryNomura calculations show a weakening trend. Import volume growth in January declined to 9.5% from a year ago compared with 13.7% in December and nearly 20% in the early months of 2015.

				Oil marketing companies Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) are set to begin sales of such cylinders with 30,000 units initially.The cylinders will be launched in Maharashtra and Gujarat, to begin with, three senior officials from the OMCs said. We are seeking composite liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders to be included in the LPG control order. As soon as that is done, we will be launching the product, a senior HPCL official said on condition of anonymity. Given that this is a new category, the official said, either the LPG control order that regulates the supply and distribution of LPG needs to be amended or a special dispensation has to be made.The OMCs are, however, sceptical about sales picking up significantly, given the high costs. Composite cylinders are expensive. A consumer will have to pay nearly Rs3,000 per cylinder. At this cost, customer acquisition will be very difficult. We will have to figure out if there will be any demand for these cylinders, a senior BPCL executive said on condition of anonymity. If the economics do not work out, we may opt out of this, the executive added.A 5kg composite cylinder will cost Rs2,000-3,000. Re-fill costs will be in line with those of a 5kg steel cylinder. An advantage of transparent gas cylinders is consumers can be assured of the quantity of gas.

0.17,"A Rs1.5 trillion mega refinery and petrochemical complex proposed by oil marketing companies (OMCs) will come up in Rajapur city of Ratnagiri district in Maharashtra, said two senior OMC officials aware of the development. 
				   
				The OMCs and the Maharashtra government have been looking for land for the past 10 months, ever since Union oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan announced the project on 28 December 2015. Rajapur is a city in the Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra, around 385km from Mumbai. The OMCsIndian Oil Corp. Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL)plan to jointly build a 60 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) refinery at a cost of Rs1.5 trillion in two phases of 40 and 20 mtpa.The piece of land identified is exactly what we wanted. It is near a potential port and around 14,000 acres. We recently received a confirmation from the Maharashtra government that they have found the required land. Now MIDC (Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation) will go ahead with the acquisition of this land, said the first of the officials cited earlier. Emails sent to the three OMCs on 28 October remained unanswered. The second of the officials added that the land identified is only for the refinery. We still need some piece of land to set up a jetty and a desalination plant for captive water supply. So we are looking for land for that, he said.Mint had reported in September that the OMCs and the state government were finding it difficult to find 15,000 acres of contiguous land in the Konkan region for the complex. Government officials had asked the OMCs to reduce the land requirement. The first official cited earlier said around 20-30% of the land parcel identified is rocky and the OMCs may need to invest Rs10,000-15,000 crore to flatten this portion of land. However, we are happy that the land that has been finalized, he added. The OMCs will form a special purpose vehicle for the project. While Indian Oil will hold a 50% stake, HPCL and BPCL will hold 25% each. The official said they are keen on bringing in a strategic partner in the project and may rework the equity structure post that. Some international partners have shown interest in the project but they will participate only after we have some concrete plans in place (for the refinery) to present to them, said the official. Pradhan had said on 6 June that the refinery had been offered to Saudi Aramco as a prospective partner.The OMCs have finalized the configuration and petrochemical linkages that the refinery will have. The government has appointed Engineers India Ltd as the technical agency to prepare a detailed feasibility report (DFR). The two OMC officials added that with the identification of the piece of land, the DFR can now be commissioned and that the report may take 8-10 months to prepare. Besides, the process for environmental approvals, deliberations on financing options, tax concessions and various board approvals can be put in place now. An analyst with a domestic brokerage said, India has been an exporter of petroleum products and its existing refineries are also being further expanded.

1.0,"India is firmly set on a path of economic growth that is estimated to usher in prosperity like never before. This economic prosperity will need to be built on the back of significant transformations across several facilitating elements, the primary ones being infrastructure build-out, energy availability and sustainability. Indias per capita energy consumption currently is almost one-third the global average, and trails far behind the mean figure for the developed world. Our energy consumption is largely based on coal, along with a preponderant dependence on other fossil fuels. Although per capita energy consumption has more than doubled over the past 15 years, almost 240 million people do not have access to affordable energy supply today. 
				   
				Energy consumption in India has grown at a compound annual growth rate of about 6% during the last decade. BP Energy Outlook 2035 expects India to achieve the fastest energy consumption growth among all major economies, despite rapid increases in non-fossil fuel production. The total energy consumption is expected to grow by 128% by 2035. Demand for gas is expected to expand by 155%, followed by coal (121%) and oil (118%), while demand for renewables, nuclear and hydro are estimated to rise by 656%, 334%, and 99%, respectively (see chart). Our potential clearly positions us as the leading global driver of growth in energy consumption in the next 20 years, possibly surpassing China in the process. Even under the most sombre growth scenarios, it is fully expected that Indias growth ambitions will lead to a 100% increase in energy consumption, thereby requiring double the existing energy sources. On the supply side, India is significantly dependent on coal as a primary fuel, which accounts for 58% of the energy consumption in the country. It is estimated that we have one of the largest resource bases of coal, with the policies and gains of the past few years positioning us strongly for the future. It is expected that India will be the largest consumer of coal, equivalent to over 435 million tonnes of oil by 2035. According to current estimates with respect to oil and gas, India is home to only 0.3% of the worlds sedimentary basins. Further, we account for a mere 0.3% of the global oil and 0.8% of the global gas reserves. We are, however, blessed with abundant natural resources in the form of sun and wind. The total wind potential in the country is estimated to be over 30 times the current installed capacity of 27 gigawatts (GW), while our solar potential is expected to grow by about 90 times the current installed capacity of 8GW. Already, the government has an aggressive target of 60GW of wind capacity and 100GW of solar capacity by 2022.ALSO READ | Believing in Indias solar mission takes a leap of faithSuccessive governments have embarked on addressing the forthcoming challenge at varying intensities and levels of aggressiveness. There are, however, some structural issues that affect the sector. Firstly, we have successively underpriced our resources, making the economics of the sector unattractive to a large number of serious investors. The energy subsidies over the years have been a major burden to the economy. The total subsidy for 2014-2015 was Rs76,285 crore. The diesel price deregulation and direct benefit transfer of liquefied petroleum gas subsidy coupled with low oil prices, led to a 64% drop in the subsidy burden for 2015-2016, which now stands at Rs27,571 crore. Gas prices in the country have also been fixed by the government based on different regional benchmarks. Domestic prices were reduced by over 50% from $5.1 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in November 2014 to $2.5 per mmBtu for the period between October and December 2016, making the sector unviable for producers, even though the country is in a supply deficit.Given this scenario, the newly announced pricing regime that promises market prices for natural gas produced from forthcoming fields is a favourable step to attract investment in the sector. While the government has provided support to several segments of our polity at different points in time, the mechanism of delivering such support has been inefficient. Secondly, past events in the policy and governance ecosystem have created the impression of a less-than-desirable regime of instability and lack of administrative efficiency. Thirdly, the relative naivety of infrastructure financing in the early years resulted in increased corporate leverage, without commensurate assets to underpin the debt levels, thus putting pressure on stakeholders, including financial institutions. These three factors, coupled with inefficient underlying processes and systems, have reduced the attractiveness of the sector to investors, whose participation is crucial for us to fulfil our 2035 aspirations.Our current path of growth and evolutionary reforms is likely to widen the gap between the supply and demand of energy, and has potential to cripple any aggressive growth plans. If no significant changes are made to the current trajectory, India might increase the burden on the fiscal front associated with energy independence and sustainability. We will then need to import significantly larger quantities of primary resources to fulfil our growth ambitions. BP expects Indias energy production as a share of consumption to decline from 57% in 2014 to 54% by 2035, and imports to rise by 153%. The countrys oil imports are expected to increase by 161%. This will account for 52% of the increase in imports, followed in volumetric terms by increases in coal imports by over 122%, and gas by over 301%.ALSO READ | A time of change for the oil industryThe future of India and its economic growth plans are critically linked to the fortunes of the energy sector.To propel this key primary sector to the next level, we need a combination of bold and aggressive moves, and a clean up to bring in more efficiency and effectiveness. The moves need to be comprehensive and coordinated. They must be focused on all aspects of managing the demand side, while fomenting the supply side, ensuring that critical enablers are in place, and firing on all cylinders. Given our requirements, the Indian energy landscape will continue to be a combination of fossil and new energy based solutions over the next 20 years. It will be important to get the balance right.The key question is, is it time to get even bolder on renewables? The present government has certainly made huge strides in achieving our renewables aspirations. Can we be the country that sets the course for a new development model for the energy sector? Can we blaze a new trial by learning from the mistakes of the more developed countries with regards to renewables? Is it possible for us to create a new paradigm for sustainable and viable development of the sector as the core to energy independence? All these would imply significant public and private investments in developing cost-effective technologies for the generation, storage and distribution of energy. So the main concern here is, is it better to channel government money earmarked for resource segments toward bets on the future of renewables? Significant innovation, both in terms of technologies and business models, will have to be made to turn the entire value chain into an attractive proposition. The key is to accelerate the process of building scale, experience, talent and knowledge, in order to help us advance the large-scale viability of the sector by many years.Secondly, commodity cycles normally go through high and lows. Currently, we are in one such trough. Is it time to make some aggressive moves that secure our fossil-related resources? The prolonged run of lower oil prices afforded the government an opportunity to create an investment fund to help Indian oil and gas companies bolster domestic as well as overseas investments. While some companies are actively seeking overseas opportunities by leveraging their own financials, we seem to have missed the opportunity for setting up a sovereign oil fund. The basis of this one-time infusion of funds to secure everything from resources to strategic reserves is paramount to our future energy independence. The often-mentioned challenge of how would we administer such a fund? is, at best, rhetorical. Our inability to find answers to such administration challenges has laid many a good idea to an early rest. Thirdly, we must consider complementing our initiatives for supply augmentation with measures that help increase our efficiency in managing demand. These initiatives also need to be supported by policies and regulations like time-of-day pricing, incentives and so on, along with large-scale investment in efficiency boosting technologies across the value chain.Finally, there is a need to rationalize the energy governance software infrastructure. The existing resource-focused governance structure (coal, oil and gas, renewables, etc.) should give way to a more integrated and comprehensive mechanism. Such a mechanism must help us understand the complex trade-offs, and allocate both human and financial resources with energy independence in mind, rather than just the oil versus gas versus coal versus renewables paradigm. The audit and licensing mindset must be replaced with effective measures to drive flexible administrative mechanisms that are more facilitative and supportive.In conclusion, the future of the economic growth of India is dependent on our ability to leverage energy sources to fuel our ambitions for the sector. In his book, The Audacity of Hope, Barack Obama, states, A nation that cant control its energy sources cant control its future. Securing our energy future is thus critical for India to become a superpower in the future.Kaustav Mukherjee is a senior partner and leads the energy practice at BCG India, and Rahool Pai Panandiker is a partner and director at BCG.",2017-01-18,mf6g1hQV6OlV6HIW5mQTiN,"Indias potential clearly positions us as the leading global driver of growth in energy consumption in the next 20 years, possibly surpassing China in the process",01:09,Indias economic growth is linked to the fortunes of the energy sector

				MEASURES: Subsidy provided for the oil sector is about Rs25,000 crore for 2017-18. This includes Rs2,500 crore towards liquified petroleum gas (LPG) connection to poor households.Basic custom duty on liquefied natural gas (LNG) has been cut to 2.5% from 5%.The finance minister proposed to create an integrated public sector oil major. This will be able to match the performance of international and domestic private sector oil and gas companies.Decision to set up Strategic Crude Oil Reserves.Retains focus on 100% village electrification by May 2018.Allocation for Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Yojana stepped up by Rs4,814 crore.Allocation for integrated power development scheme also increased.An additional 20,000 megawatt to be added in the second phase of solar park development scheme.Taxes on parts, machinery used to manufacture solar power project components reduced.IMPACT:Oil subsidy allocation may be slightly on the conservative side to meet industry needs for 2017-18. There is a risk if the increase in oil prices is more than anticipated.Decline in LNG custom duty is positive for the sector. Analysts expect Petronet LNGs utilizations to get some fillip. Gas distributors such as Indraprastha Gas Ltd and Mahanagar Gas Ltd are expected to benefit on account of this move. Their profit margins could improve depending on the extent of the decline in prices the companies pass on to consumers. In general, decline in LNG custom duty is expected to encourage the use of natural gas, which is considered a relatively cleaner fuel.As regards the creation of an integrated oil major, while the idea is certainly laudable, the key challenge will be integration issues especially on the human resources side, pointed out K.

Share prices of Petronet LNG, IGL and MGL were up 3.7%, 2.3% and 3%, respectively. LNG custom duty cut boosted sentiments for these stocks.Shares of Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Oil Corp. Ltd and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd rose 1.7%, 3% and 2.5% , respectively. The optimism could be due to the proposal to create an integrated public sector oil major. Investors, of course, will have to wait for the details of how this will pan out.The Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd stock declined nearly 1%. One reason for that is the fact no announcement was made regarding decline in cess on crude oil production, which was one of the key expectations for this budget.Suzlon Energy Ltd shares fell 5%.

0.25,"On 13 October, the fertilizer ministry issued an office memo stating that the movement of finished fertilizers by coastal shipping/inland waterways will be eligible for a freight subsidy granted by the government to fertilizer firms.
				   
				 So far, only railway freight for primary movement of finished fertilizers from plants/ports to the nearest railway station of the dealers was reimbursed. The fertilizer ministry has a yearly budget of about Rs2,000 crore for this subsidy.Primary movement has been redefined and expanded to cover transportation by rail, and/or coastal shipping or inland water transport or by any or two or by all three modes of transportation from the plant or port to the various railway rake points of districts (where dealers are located), P.B. Sahu, a fertilizer ministry official, wrote in the memo. Fertilizer firms in the public, private and co-operative sectors pay the railway freight for the primary movement and then claim the money from the government, according to the practice followed.In the new regime, freight subsidy for primary movement using coastal shipping/inland water transport will be reimbursed by the government in the same manner but at the lower of the equivalent railway rates or actual rates paid by the fertilizer firms, Sahu said.The development lends a big boost to coastal shipping and inland water transport, which the government is seeking to promote to ease congestion on rail and road, reduce carbon emissions and cut logistics costs.Fertilizer is seen as an ideal cargo to shift to water. Fertilizer production is very energy-intensivewith the cost of feedstock and fuel alone accounting for 55-80% of production cost. From the logistics perspective, therefore, production cost is of particular interest. Growing agri-produce and an increase in the overall sown area will prompt greater demand for fertilizer end-productsaround 70 million tonnes (mt) by 2020 and around 120 mt by 2035. The volume of imports of fertilizer raw materials and finished products will grow at 4%, keeping the volumes handled at Indian ports fairly stable by 2020.Indias 12 ports owned by the central government loaded 8.493 mt of finished fertilizers in the year to March 2016, clocking growth of 8.18%. While rail is currently the primary mode of transport for long-distance fertilizer movement, experts say a modal-mix shift towards coastal shipping can significantly cut costs. For instance, the movement between Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra costs Rs1,928 per tonne via rail, while the same movement via road and rail-supported coastal shipping could cut cost to as low as Rs1,415 per tonnea potential cost saving of 25-30%, according to the ministry. If key rail movements are considered from major fertilizer plants to the top-200 fertilizer-consuming districts in India, around 10 plants have the potential to shift to coastal shipping, the ministry reckons.Fertilizer corporations with multiple plant locations across the country seem to have the highest potential to leverage coastal shipping.Finished products constitute half of the 28 mt of fertilizers that India imports in a year, with raw materials for the farm nutrients making up the other half. The inclusion of coastal shipping/inland water transport in the freight subsidy scheme for moving fertilizers could spur interest among fleet owners by purchasing the right vessels that can move seamlessly between sea and inland waterways to tap this business. Indias maritime regulator, the director general of shipping, has already set rules for running the so-called river-sea vessels.After putting in place an enabling environment to kick-start the fledgling sector through the Sagarmala programme, the government is now targeting fertilizers and automobiles to show the way. The shipping of cars by sea on roll-on-roll-off ships is slowly picking up on the back of an 80% discount in vessel-related and cargo-related charges over the rates approved at the ports owned by the Indian government for a two-year period.The shipment of cars on national waterway 1 between Varansai and Haldia has also commenced.Water currently contributes less than 6% to Indias modal mix and the government is looking to double this share by 2025. China uses its inland waterways to transport raw material and finished goods between the eastern and western provinces; water contributes 24% to Chinas freight modal mix. Australia carries 17% of goods through coastal shipping. In Germany, 11% of goods are moved through inland waterways and coastal shipping.If the movement of automobiles and fertilizers through coastal shipping and inland waterways catches up, it would not be long before producers of other commodities such as oil, liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas, steel, iron ore, coal and cement also seriously consider a big switch to this cost-effective and eco-friendly mode of transport, with a little more support from the government. This would give a lot more confidence to cargo owners, who are now sceptical about the sustainability of such a shift, to move their goods by water.The fertilizer ministrys decision to bring coastal shipping and inland water transport under the freight subsidy plan shows that the Narendra Modi government is willing to tweak existing schemes to prop up the twin sectors, rather than formulate new incentive packages to achieve the objective. Many more funding schemes with individual ministries/departments can be tapped to promote water transport.P. Manoj looks at trends in the shipping industry.",2016-10-28,o4WIJOP90gHDELZ7KCWZGM,Fertilizer ministrys decision to bring coastal shipping and inland water transport under freight subsidy plan shows government is willing to tweak schemes to prop up the twin sectors,00:10,"Will fertilizers, automobiles show water transport the way?"

				Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and mutual funds have been more optimistic, with the latter increasing their ownership in 12 Tata group firms and cutting their stake in seven. In the December quarter, state-run LIC, Indias biggest investor, cut its stakes in seven out of the 11 Tata group firms it owns stakes in, according to stock exchange data. Twenty-seven Tata group firms are listed. FPIs slashed holdings in nine and increased their holdings in nine Tata group firms. LIC cut its stake by the most in Tata Chemicals Ltd, where it reduced its holding by 73 basis points (bps) to 2.59%. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. In Tata Global Beverages Ltd, it slashed its holdings by 60 bps and by 35 bps in Tata Communications Ltd. Titan Co. Ltd and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd are the only Tata group firms in which LIC increased its stakes during this period.Overall, the value of LICs holdings in listed Tata firms came down by Rs2,371 crore or 6.4% between 24 October, when the Tata Sons board suddenly ousted Mistry, and the end of December. In comparison, the entire market capitalization of Tata listed firm fell by 7.6%.  A lot of things that were kept under wraps have come to the fore after the Tata-Mistry dispute started. So, from an FPI point of view, especially when US markets have started looking up, there is not much reason for them to stay heavily invested in Tata firms for the time being, said the head of a mid-sized asset management firm, requesting anonymity. FPIs too slashed their holdings in Tata group firms such as Tata Elxsi Ltd (3.2 percentage points) and 1.9 percentage point in Tata Motors. On the flip side, foreign investors also raised their stakes in 9 firms, including Trent Ltd by 2.66 percentage points and Indian Hotels Co. Ltd (54 bps). However, given the overall decline in prices of Tata group firmsa trend mirroring the broader marketthe value of FPI holdings in Tata firms fell by 10.9%, or Rs18,131 crore, between 24 October putsch and the end of December. In the three months to December, FPIs sold $6.72 billion worth of shares.LIC is looking to slash its holdings in Tata group firms further gradually over concerns that the ongoing Tata-Mistry feud may continue for several years, diminishing returns on investments, according to two people familiar with LICs investment strategies, including an LIC official. They did not want to be named because the matter is market-sensitive. The Tata-Mistry spat has reached the doors of the National Company Law Tribunal and hearings are on from Tuesday. An email sent to LIC remained unanswered. No one knows how long this will continue and how much damage it will inflict on investments (made) by shareholders.

				Rosneft PJSC is part of a group of investors that beat suitors from Saudi Arabia and Iran to buy Essar Oil Ltds Vadinar refinery, Indias second-biggest, in a deal announced over the weekend. Russias largest oil producer is following a strategy by resource-rich firms and nations to secure outlets for their output, and may supply the facility with Venezuela crude and challenge Middle East exporters that provide about two-thirds of the countrys imports.India will be the most important product-growth market over the next 25 years, making it important to Russia, according to Neil Beveridge, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.With the Essar deal, Rosneft is targeting a market of 1.3 billion people that imports more than 80% of its crude requirements and which is forecast by the International Energy Agency to be the worlds fastest-growing oil consuming nation through 2040. The country has emerged as a bright spot for global demand as the quickest economic expansion among major economies spurs increased use of trucks, cars and motorbikes.Market accessThe transaction also includes about 2,700 Essar Oil retail stations, a market that has attracted top oil companies such Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc. Most of Essars output is sold domestically, either through its own outlets or to government-owned fuel retailers.The access to the Indian market attracted Rosneft the most, Prashant Ruia, chairman of Essar Oil, said in an interview in Mumbai on Sunday. It is one of the worlds largest markets.

Saudi Arabia is buying stakes in refiners through its state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco in countries from Indonesia to the US. Kuwait is also investing in processing facilities.Essar Oils Vadinar refinery in Gujarat can process about 400,000 barrels a day. It was designed to run on low-quality crudes from Venezuelan or the Middle East, rather than Russian grades. Venezuela made up almost half the refinerys supplies in the first six months of the year, followed by Iran, according to shipping data obtained by Bloomberg.The best way for Rosneft to supply crude to Essar is via its equity in Venezuela, said Tushar Tarun Bansal, director at Ivy Global Energy, an industry consultant in Singapore. Bringing this crude to India helps Rosneft and Russia the most by securing their equity crude supply and not adversely impacting its own market in Europe.By comparison, Middle East exporters led by Iraq and Saudi Arabia provided more than 65% of Indias overall crude imports during the April-June quarter, according to oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan.Strategic dealsRosneft and Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the state oil company, agreed earlier this year to terms on swapping crude oil and fuels. The Russian oil giant also has interests in five projects in VenezuelaPetromonagas, Petrovictoria, Petromiranda, Boqueron and Petroperijathat contain estimated oil reserves that exceed 20.5 billion tonnes (about 150 billion barrels), the company said in February.India has been deepening its energy ties with Russia, which has also developed nuclear reactors in the South Asian nation and has discussed increasing supplies of natural gas through both LNG and pipelines. Indian state-owned companies have so far spent almost $6 billion for new stakes in Russian oil assets in Siberia.After letting India companies invest in Russian exploration and production projects, India is reciprocating by allowing Russian oil major Rosneft to invest in refining in India, said Bernsteins Beveridge. These agreements are very strategic, aimed at boosting Indias energy security and boosting Russias access to the most important long term growth market. Bloomberg",2016-10-17,oMDuiVNGQqQXrS5QCOYSKM,"With the Essar Oil deal, Rosneft is targeting the Indian market which is forecast to be the worlds fastest-growing oil consuming nation through 2040",12:27,Rosnefts Essar Oil deal takes Russias turf war to Middle East backyard

				Tata Sons, which has a 73.26% stake in TCS, nominated Ishaat Hussain, a Tata group veteran, as the interim chairman of the company with immediate effect. Thus, Mistry ceases to be chairman of the TCS board, the company said in a stock exchange statement on Thursday.Separately, Tata Sons has requested a shareholder meeting of Indian Hotels Co. Ltd (IHCL) to pass a resolution for the removal of Mistry as director. On 4 November, IHCLs independent directors unanimously backed Mistrys board position as chairman.This could mark the beginning of a protracted battle,  analysts said.Also read: Did Tata Sons violate insider trading norms?According to the articles of association of TCS, as long as Tata Sons (and associates) holds at least 26% of the firm, the holding company has the right to nominate the chairman of the board of directors.People close to Mistry have questioned TCSs move, saying that Tata Sons has the right to only nominate a candidate.TCS had to then convene a board meeting and table the nomination at the board at a meeting or through a circular resolution. Nothing of this nature was done. In pre-meditated haste, by a letter of the same date, TCS has directly gone on to announce that Mistry stands replaced, one of the people said.A TCS spokesperson said the due process was followed. Under Article 90 of the articles of association of the company, the majority shareholders of Tata Sons are vested with the power to nominate the chairman. Accordingly, it informed all the board directors that Hussain is being nominated as the chairman, the spokesperson said. Sumit Agrawal, partner, Suvan Law Advisors, said that under the Companies Act, where articles of association specifically and categorically provide a right to a major shareholder or group of shareholder to nominate a chairman, exercising that right effectively removes the incumbent with immediate effect till a regular appointment of someone else through a shareholder resolution is made.The concept of shareholders right in the modern corporate world denotes the shareholders supremacy in the governance of the business and the affairs of the corporate sector either directly or through their elected representatives, said Agrawal.These shareholders, he pointed out, have certain statutory rights which nobody can take away, except in accordance with prescribed norms under articles and provisions of the Companies Act.That said, the process followed in TCS to nominate a new chairman neednt necessarily be followed in other group companies. Thats because the method of appointment or removal of chairman is incorporated in the articles of association of a company. In Tata Motors, for instance, the right to appoint the chairman lies with the board and not Tata Sons.Also read: Is trust deficit widening on Tatas narrative on Cyrus Mistry?For removing Mistry as a director, shareholder approval is needed and the request for an extraordinary general meeting in TCS by Tata Sons points to that.Under the provisions of the Companies Act, anyone holding at least 10% of a company can call for a shareholders meeting and propose a special resolution to remove directors before the end of their tenure.Amit Tandon, founder and managing director of Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS), a proxy advisory firm, said that the latest move marks the beginning of Tata Sons moving shareholder resolutions to remove Mistry from the board of operating companies.In the case of TCS, as they have more than 70% stake, they are quite confident of pulling it through, he said.In other Tata group operating companies where Mistry is chairman, Tata Sons (plus other group companies that have cross-holdings) owns a 30-35% stake.In Tata Chemicals, whose board met on Thursday, it has only a 29.98% ownership.To pass a resolution supporting the removal of Mistry as director, the Tatas will need a 51% majority. Thus, the role of institutional shareholders, particularly Life Insurance Corp. of India, becomes important.The state-owned insurer holds around 13% each in Tata Steel Ltd and Tata Power, and 10% in Tata Global Beverages Ltd.The vote of institutional investors will be decisive. Perhaps, this is a reason why Tata Sons has come out with a detailed statement today explaining its need to replace Mr. Mistry and also rejecting claims made by him in his letter to the Board of Tata Sons, said a statement by InGovern Research Services Pvt. Ltd.Hussains nomination comes on the heels of a snub the promoters faced on 4 November when independent directors unanimously backed Mistrys board position at Indian Hotels, which owns the Taj group.

Fight battles inside boardrooms, said Rumi Behram Balsara, a second-generation shareholder in some Tata group companies.Tata ethosFrom shipyards to textiles, Mumbais Parsis have led the citys commercial development from a group of sleepy fishing villages to one of Asias business capitals.Parsi business houses owned by the Tata, Wadia and Godrej families are at the forefront of Indias corporate world. The Tata empire stretches from Jaguar Land Rover to Tetley Tea, while the Wadia family owns textile and food-product businesses. The Godrej Group owns interests in everything from consumer goods to chemicals.Also read: The fig leaf of corporate governanceParsis follow the Zoroastrian faith, an ancient pre-Islamic religion of Iran. Some of the tenets of the faith like charity and doing good to others have long been woven into the Tata heritage and business ethos. Much of the dividend paid out by Tata Sons gets funnelled into charitable trusts involved in philanthropic work.The crux of the Tata world view, said Morgen Witzel, a UK-based author of a book on the Tata company, is shareholder value should not be an end in itself. Companies are not machines for making money. They exist to provide value and service to their communities; profit is a by-product of that process.That view appears to be at the heart of the boardroom dust-up. Mistry was attempting to gradually transform Tata from a sprawling empire of middling businesses into a much more focused profit-driven enterprise, but that involved decisions like axing businesses and jobs, moves that jarred with the Tata ethos, say sources close to the conglomerate.Over time, the Tatas had built up a fantastic reputation. However, the size and resistance to change meant that many of their businesses were not able to keep up with the times, said Ronny Bharda, a Mumbai-based Parsi businessman. Cyrus Mistry brought about a renewed sense of enthusiasm. He had the ability to bring about change.Eventually, what social good can the house of Tatas do, if they do not earn any money?More than businessSome Parsis believe the community should ignore the spat.The Parsi community isnt the custodian of thoughts, words and deeds of every Parsi, said Baghzaad Bhomisha, a Mumbai-born Parsi settled in Australia, adding Parsis had bigger concerns than the egos and worthless legacies of Parsi billionaires.Mistry, an Irish citizen, was the first chairman in the Tata groups 148-year history to not belong to the Tata family. He was named chair of the group in 2011 after a lengthy search for a replacement for Ratan Tata. In an organization populated by veterans, his anointment at the age of 43 was a marked departure for the Tatas.Mistrys family is also prominent and has long had ties with the Tatas. His elder brother Shapoor runs the Shapoorji Pallonji conglomerate, which is focused on construction and real estate. It also owns the largest individual stake in Tata Sons, after the family trusts headed by Ratan Tata.The two families are related by marriageCyrus Mistrys sister is married to Ratan Tatas half-brother Noel.Mistrys ouster shows a person with a keen business sense only wont work. Tata is built on more than just business, said Kaizad Todywalla, a Parsi who owns a coin auction house in Mumbai.I personally believe you need a Tata to make sure that the ethos of the group or the philosophy behind it remains. Reuters",2016-11-01,oRoGbj4ivMXhf5SHo5yaqI,"The public allegations of malfeasance and the central role of two billionaire Parsis , Rata Tat a and Cyrus Mistry has not gone down well in the communit",12:31,Tata vs Mistry shocks Parsi community
0.51,"New Delhi: Indias biggest fuel retailer is seeking to buy oil assets as demand surges in the worlds fastest growing energy market.
				   
				State-run Indian Oil Corp. wants to buy assets globally to ensure a tenth of its refining capacity is fed by crude that is either from its own oil field or from assets where it has a stake, Chairman B. Ashok said in an interview on Monday. That goal will require the company to boost oil production 10-fold to about 210,000 barrels a day in the next eight years. There is a lot of potential production from our existing blocks, Ashok said in his office in New Delhi, referring to the blocks it holds in Africa, Latin America and the US. We are also looking at economics and seeing where the assets are available.Indian Oil, the nations biggest company by sales, and other state companies are increasing global acquisitions to secure energy supplies and meet demand thats expected to double by 2040. The biggest oil sector downturn in a generation opened a window for the energy hungry Indian companies to snap up assets as oilfield operators looked to sell assets or take partners to share expenses.Diversifying geographiesThis is a good time for Indian companies to buy oil assets overseas, said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at InterfaxEnergys Global Gas Analytics in London. There could be potential interest in the Middle East and Africa, and opportunities in Latin American nations such as Brazil and Mexico as they seek foreign partnerships to boost output.China had similarly stepped up overseas oil and gas investments after the 2008 oil price crash, snapping up assets for $108 billion in the five years to 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Indias oil companies spent almost $6 billion buying stakes in Russian oil fields last year. Indian Oil is diversifying its search to other geographies and is evaluating offers from global oil companies that are looking to sell some of their assets to generate cash, Ashok said. He did not give details.There are lot of opportunities possibly on offer in Africa, Middle-East and South East Asia, he said. We are looking at these and if the prices are right, we will go for it.The companys shares, which have risen 55% in the past year, added 1.2% to Rs346.8 in Mumbai on Tuesday.Refinery expansionApart from oil production, the company also plans to increase refining capacity. It is building one of countrys biggest refinery-cum-petrochemicals complex on the western coast along with two other state-run oil companies. It will own 50% in the proposed project and is keen to bring in a foreign partner, Ashok said.Indian Oil plans to spend about Rs1.8 trillion ($26.2 billion) through 2022 to expand it refining capacity to over 100 million tons and build new pipeline and distribution infrastructure. The company currently processes 80.7 million tons of crude a year from its nine plants and two owned by its unit Chennai Petroleum Corp. Indias oil demand is forecast to reach 10.3 million barrels per day by 2040, according to Paris-based International Energy Agency.The countrys 23 refineries have a total capacity of about 230 million tons a year, while total fuel demand was 196.5 million tons during 2016, according to the oil ministry.

0.01,"Mumbai/New Delhi: Global oil majors BP Plc and Rosneft PJSC are eyeing a piece of Indias $117 billion retail market for fossil fuels, threatening to shake up government-owned companies that have faced little competition for a decade.
				   
				BP has already secured licenses to open as many as 3,500 fuel stations in the worlds second most-populous nation. Rosneft gained access to about 2,700 pumps through last months acquisition of Essar Oil Ltd, which has plans to add 2,600 more outlets. Along with Reliance Industries Ltd and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, the private players will try to chip away at the dominant position of three state-owned enterprises that control 90% of market volume.Competition is expected to intensify with the entry and expansion of private players and multinational companies, said Rahul Prithiani, a Mumbai-based director at CRISIL, a unit of S&P Global Ratings. Private players and multinational companies are expected to increase their market share though government companies will probably still dominate given their vast network of fuel retailing stations, he said.Retail sales have become more viable for private-sector refiners ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modis government scrapped diesel-price controls two years ago. Pricing freedom coupled with record oil consumption as the number of trucks, cars and motorbikes multiply is helping India stand out as a country that global oil majors cant ignore.The Paris-based International Energy Agency predicts India will be the worlds fastest-growing oil consuming nation through 2040.This sort of growth they will not get anywhere, said Lalit Kumar Gupta, chief executive officer of Essar Oil. Europe is virtually saturated, there is hardly any growth. In the US there is tough competition. India is the only country which is growing and which is growing by a big number and they feel there is scope.Companies including Saudi Aramco and Frances Total SA have shown an interest in India, while existing players such as Shell are planning to expand their footprint, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said in June, flagging further reforms in the oil and gas sector. More fuel retailers will increase competition and benefit consumers, he said.This is Indias second attempt at deregulation. Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries had captured 14% of retail diesel sales and 7% of petrol sales in 2006, after the government deregulated prices more than a decade back. The company had to close down pumps after price caps were re-introduced.The October 2014 deregulation is an opportunity for Reliance Industries to re-enter the retail market and ramp up volumes, according to the companys latest annual report. RIL plans to launch aggressive customer acquisition programs to quickly regain targeted market share, it said.Reliance Industries has re-secured over 4.5% of sales to bulk users of diesel, such as railways and state-operated bus services, the company said. It has opened about 1,100 stations so far, with plans to increase the number to 1,400 by March.Rising consumptionIndias fuel demand grew 11%in the year ended 31 March, the fastest pace in records going back to fiscal 2001. Consumption expanded 8% in the first half of the financial year that started 1 April, according to the oil ministrys Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell.BP sees a strong future for transportation fuels in India, the British oil major said in an emailed statement last week. We are keen to be involved in this market and contribute to its development.Still, private players have a long battle on their hands given the dominating position of the three government-owned companies, Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd, which together operate almost 53,000 fuel stations in India.If we compare with 10 years ago when private players had come, since then the state-run oil marketing companies are much better prepared, said Sanjiv Singh, head of refineries at Indian Oil, the countrys biggest fuel retailer. It will definitely bring in efficiency. The challenge before us is that while private players target the very-prime market, our commitment is to feed the total market.International companies may first make a dent in the large-scale industrial and commercial market, since public-sector companies have established themselves at prime locations for fuel pumps, Vikas Halan, vice president at Moodys Investors Service, said by phone.Thats where the competition heats up with the foreign players, he said.

This is the second straight increase in rates, coming on the back of 3.11% rise in 1 October. In case of subsidised LPG, this is the sixth increase in price since July when the government decided to go in for a small hikes of up to Rs 2 per bottle every month to cut down its subsidy outgo. LPG rates were last hiked on 28 October by Rs1.5 per cylinder on account of hike in commission paid to dealers. In the last monthly hike, rates went up by Rs2.03 per cylinder on 1 October to Rs427.09. Prior to that rates were hiked by Rs1.97 per cylinder on 1 September, Rs1.93 on 16 August and by Rs1.98 per 14.2-kg cylinder on 1 July.

The near Rs2 per cylinder hike in LPG every month is also aimed at doing the same thing.

According to the holding firms articles of association, a selection committee is needed to both select and replace a chairman. However, the Tatas have said they had sought legal opinion before replacing him, and it isnt clear why Mistry has not pursued this option so far.If relevant, the breach of any contractual shareholder rights may also be alleged in terms of the shareholders agreement at the Tata Sons level. Whether the parties approach arbitration or the courts will also be dependent upon the terms of the said agreement, said Tejesh Chitlangi, partner at law firm IC Legal.Pursuing the corporate governance angle, Mistry could complain to Sebi about these issues, especially the possible violation of the need-to-know principle under securities regulations.Many of allegations in the public domain against Tata Sons pertain to financial irregularities and insider trading for which Mistry can approach CBI, Sebi. According to his statements, the end goal is to achieve better governance practices, so such investigations could lead to short term pain; however, down the line, there would be cleaner processes, said Shriram Subramanian, founder of proxy advisory firm, InGovern.Yet another option is to approach the government. At the heart of the governance reform,  which Mistry wants to institute, lies the relationship of the Tata Trusts with the group operating companies. He has said the government has an inherent obligation to remedy and repair (the) breakdown in the governance of Tata Trusts.In his Monday message, Mistry talked about how the trustees wielded no voting power on Tata Sons shares until 15 years ago, because company law had vested it in the hands of the government.The role of MCA (ministry of corporate affairs) in administering The Companies Act, 2013, and of the ministry of finance in seeking the stand of Sebi and stock exchanges is also involved, since the episode has international ramifications of Indias rankings for business environment, Agrawal of Suvan added.Mistry could present these issues of corporate governance and ethics to institutional investors and ask them to raise questions with the Tatas.We have brought the dialogue on the table, both from the point of view of governance and ethics, and I think that is today in peoples minds. I believe you will see shareholders in the near future demanding (better) governance, Mistry said in an interview on Monday.I also think that the institutional investors should write to Tata Sons seeking that what is their succession plan, because from where we stand, it seems to be completely unclear, said Subramanian of InGovern.Lastly, Mistry and his family can buy shares of the Tata group operating companies from the open market, if he thinks that will best serve his interests as a shareholder in the group.

Private firms are seeing incremental positives, such as CESCs Chandrapur plant tying up a power purchasing agreement (PPA), JSW Energy Ltd getting short listed for a Karnataka PPA and Adani narrowing losses.But the firms are yet to reach a stage where their earnings will begin to see positive momentum. For instance, Adani Power and Tata Powers compensatory tariff issues for their plants are yet to be settled; CESCs Chandrapur plant still has free capacities that need to be tied up and PPA finalization for JSW Energy is awaited.

0.66,"Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltds (RIL) third-quarter report card may not have had the stock market excited, but the energy company expects its gross refining margins (GRMs) to stay in double digits going forward. 
				   
				GRM is what a refiner  earns from turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel. RIL announced its third-quarter results on 16 January. During the quarter, RIL's GRMs stood at $10.8 per barrel, against $10.1  in the second quarter and $11.5  a year ago. Though it reported a $4.1 per barrel premium to Singapore complex margins, it was the lowest in the past three quarters. Singapore GRMs came in at $6.74 per barrel. This is our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit GRMs and double-digit GRMs are good, said Srikanth Venkatachari, Reliances joint chief financial officer, after the companys  earmings conference. Srikanth added that he sees the GRMs sustained at these levels going forward. As a refinery, we are seeing a demand growth for products. The underlying demand trends are good. When you look at the demand for refined products and the supply for the same, clearly, demand outstrips supply. Our own outlook is that we continue to think that the refining environment is in a good spot. (RIL) Management expects GRM to remain strong as net refining capacity addition of 5 million barrels of oil per day (mbpd) over the next five years will lag demand growth of 6 mbpd. In the medium term too, fuel demand growth of 1.3 mbpd in CY2017 shall surpass refining capacity addition, thereby keeping margins firm. Also, strong demand growth from Asia (especially India and China) and refinery closures in Europe will support GRM, said Axis Capital in its research report dated 17 January.Refining and marketing and petrochemicals form over 95% of RILs profit. RIL reported a 3.6% increase in its consolidated net profit at Rs7,506 crore for the three months ended 31 December from Rs7,245 crore a year earlier. Consolidated revenue came in at Rs 84,189 crore against Rs 72,513 crore a year earlier. Goldman Sachs in a report dated 17 January said it expects RILs refining margins to outperform peers. The company refined 17.8 million tonnes of crude oil during the quarter, lower than the 18 million tonnes  a year earlier, following a five-week shutdown at a catalytic cracking unit. The company operates two refineries in Gujarat, with a combined capacity of 1.24 million barrels a day. RILs two refineries in Jamnagar help it process cheaper crude, boosting its refining margins. RIL, which has invested heavily in expansion of its core projects, will see the expansion paying off from FY18. Analysts expect GRMs to be boosted by $0.7-$0.9 per barrel by the commissioning of the expansion of its core projects.  ""RILs grandiose $50 billion capex programme is nearing completion and will effectively double its gross block by FY18 estimated. About 35% of the overall capex was incurred towards core businessesrefining, petrochemicaloff as cracker ($5bn); petcoke gasification ($5bn); and US ethane imports ($1.5bn) are on track for commissioning from January 20117 to end CY17.These should further enhance GRMs and petrochemical margins,"" said Edelweiss Securities Ltd in its report dated 16 January.  Investment in petcoke gasification will help RIL meet its entire fuel requirement at the refineries and eliminate its petcoke production of 6.5 million tonnes a year, generated from two of its cokers. The technology for petcoke gasification will help RIL produce 23 mscmd (million standard cubic metres a day) of syngas and will aid in reducing R-LNG (regasified liquefied natural gas) intake for its refineries.  In the analyst meet, the company highlighted plans to raise the utilization rate for its downstream refining units, which along with term contracts on heavy crude, should help cushion the impact from potential reduction in crude discounts. The company highlighted its flexibility to move product yields by 10-15% which we believe should support GRMs as we see diesel margins outperforming gasoline in 2017,"" said Morgan Stanley in its report dated 17 January.",2017-01-24,rJaSLjQgZUrrwefo1NcxRO,GRM is what a refiner  earns from turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel ,10:28,RIL hopes its double-digit GRM will continue to hit the sweet spot 
0.08,"Mumbai: Adding a fresh twist to the nearly two-month-old battle with Tata Sons Ltd, Cyrus P. Mistry on Monday announced his decision to not contest the forthcoming extraordinary general meetings (EGMs) and instead step down from the board of all the operating companies where he is a director.
ALSO READ | Cyrus Mistry cedes space to take moral high groundIn his first media interaction since the boardroom putsch that forced him to exit, Mistry said he is shifting gears and taking the fight with Tata Sons to a bigger platform, hinting, perhaps, at legal challenges to come. He said Tata Sonss coercive behaviour and uncertainty facing the shareholders had made him decide to quit. Edited excerpts:What prompted this decision to step down?I think the reason for the decision is wedded in the history of the Pallonji family, which has always supported the Tata group. What I have seen in the last eight weeks is a significant coercive behaviour from Tata Sons with employees and other stakeholders,  and as you see in their EGM notice, a threatening attitude, creating a situation of tremendous unease.My belief is that from here, the platform has to change to the legal side to ensure we protect the shareholders. The output is still the samewhat we are ensuring is governance reform and ensuring the ethical values of the founder... I will continue to pursue that very vigorously. What we have seen in the last eight weeks as far as the EGMs are concernedthe process has shown a lack of governance which I have detailed out. It has thrown up many ethical issues that have come to the fore. What we also saw in the last eight weeks is the huge amount of uncertainty, which I wanted to put to bed.What was the trigger for the move to step down?There was no trigger. One has to reflect from time to time. What we have achieved so far, is to initiate a dialogues for change and reform. What one would achieve by going ahead with the EGMs would be more destructive than productive.History shows that we have always looked at the best interest of the group. I believe the best interest of the group will be served by taking this to a new platform.What nextI cant discuss the legal strategy, but you will see it unfold.What would be the status of the EGM (of Indian Hotels) which was to take place tomorrow (Tuesday)?I think the EGM will be cancelled.What other steps will you take to ensure that all these governance reforms are carried out?We have brought the dialogue on the table, both from the point of view of governance and ethics, and I think that is today in peoples minds. I believe you will see shareholders in the near future demanding (better) governance.Have there been any instances that make you feel that some of this has already come to the fore?Yes, I think I will not go into the details of which one, but there have been instances of that.And I think also what is important was to first take me out of the equation because if I am in the equation, it gets clouded. I want to take myself out of the equation to make sure this is not a battle about me; this is effectively a battle for company governance reform. So by doing so, I have taken myself out of the position. I have been consistent if you see on the same thingin my EGM, in my representation.Again, I have reiterated this in my letter to the TCS (Tata Consultancy Services Ltd) shareholders. Many shareholders are ready to abstain to send a message to the company that this is not something that they wanted to do.Would Mr Wadias moves have had an impact?Mr Wadia has taken his own independent decision, and I think Mr Wadia might well continue with his position. His position is different from mine; his position is from an independent directors point of view, and, clearly, the fact that I am not contesting the EGM, strengthens his position because there is no question of him supporting me. I think he has always been for the institution of independent directors and thats the fight that he will continue I am sure.Whats the end game in terms of governance reforms that you want to achieve?I think from my perspective whats important is that the (Tata) Trusts themselves look at an appropriate governance structure, whether thats including succession planning, decision-making, and the interface with Tata Sons.ALSO READ | Tata Sons calls Cyrus Mistry resignation a deliberate strategyTata Sons itself at the board (level) has to reform and understand how it interacts with the Trusts and with the operating companies. And I think thats the part of the reform that needs to happen on the governance side. If you look at it on the ethics side, I think people who have been involved in any unethical actions have to vacate office. I think thats crucially important.Why did it take you so long to raise these issues?If you look at it, all of these issues,  whether they are governance reform and ethics, are exactly what I have been raising in Tata Sons. My role in Tata Sons is actually to raise those issues. My shareholders representation has raised the same issues. I have raised those issues again in the TCS letter, so I have been consistent. You will also see that in my statement and you will see that statement in the video (Editor's note: Mistry released a video on Monday explaining his position)  that effectively these were part of the board agenda the day that I was removed, and most probably a part of the reason I was removed as well.Did you these issues before the 24 October board meeting?The governance issues have been raised for a long time; the debate on performance of governance or structures of governance have been there for more than six months may be close to a year.You said in your letter that Ratan Tata said the reason (for removal) will go down with him to his grave...?I am waiting.

-0.62,"Mumbai: One of the biggest drivers of Indias superlative macro-economic performance in the recent past has been a relatively under-appreciated element: oil. Since 2014, the dramatic fall in crude oil prices has helped India contain her twin deficits, and tame inflation. But with oil exporting countries planning to curtail oil supply, raising the possibility of a rise in oil prices, the Indian economy might soon have to deal with another pain point besides demonetisation.
				   
				The extent of the gains from lower oil prices since mid-2014 is under-appreciated as the benefits have not been evident in the retail prices of petrol or diesel. However, the government did improve its finances, using the opportunity to increase the amount of taxes collected on petroleum products, as the charts below illustrate.The excise duty collected by the Union government on petrol and diesel has been hiked nine times since November 2014. The Union governments tax collection from petrol and diesel has increased from 0.4% of GDP in 2013-14 to 1.1% in 2015-16, i.e. an increase of 70 basis points (bps) in two years. To put this in perspective, this is more than the 60 bps reduction achieved in gross fiscal deficit (from 4.5% of GDP to 3.9% of GDP) over the same period. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.In other words, the entire reduction in Indias fiscal deficit could be attributed to the increase in Centres tax revenue from petrol and diesel alone. Hence, it is fair to say that falling crude oil prices have driven the improvements in Indias public finances over the past couple of years. Looking at more recent data for the first half of the fiscal year ending March 2017 (April-September 2016), and combining taxes with other oil-linked receipts such as dividends from public sector petroleum companies and states VAT collection on petroleum products, we find that the total receipts of the Centre and state governments from the petroleum sector have risen by about 50 bps since fiscal 2015 to 3.14%.Even the above-mentioned gains from the petroleum sector might be an underestimate because besides the increase in taxes, the Centre also gained from reduced subsidy burden owing to the fall in crude prices. Diesel prices were deregulated in 2014 and the diesel subsidy was eliminated in the last fiscal year (2015-16) itself. Previously, subsidy on diesel would cost 0.6% of GDP (FY14), jointly borne by the government and the public sector petroleum companies. Besides, subsidies on PDS kerosene and LPG have also reduced; however these reductions could also be attributed to government initiative to reform rather than a fall in petroleum prices per se. The upcoming Union Budget 2017 is likely to assume an average crude oil price of $55-$60 per barrel, as reported by the Hindustan Times. However, there remain risks that oil prices, which are already near $55 per barrel, could shoot up if the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and other oil exporters make good on their pledge to cut global oil supply by around 1.8%. Such a scenario, according to the International Energy Agency, would move the global oil market into deficit in the first half of 2017, i.e. demand would outstrip supply, after more than two years of comfortable surplus.In such a scenario, if oil rises above the governments comfort zone to say around $70 per barrel, then the government could lose tax revenues equivalent to about 0.4% of GDP which would jeopardize the governments plan to cut the fiscal deficit to 3% of GDP next year.To illustrate, in a hypothetical scenario where the global crude oil price is $70 per barrel in the coming fiscal year (2017-18) and the USD/INR exchange rate remains stable at 68, the government could either allow the petrol price (Delhi) to rise by another Rs10 to over Rs80 per litre, or reduce its excise tax duty from currently Rs21.48 per litre to Rs11.48 (if it wishes to keep prices same). If the government decides to reduce excise duties on petrol and diesel in similar fashion, then the Centres revenue from petrol and diesel could shrink to 0.7% of GDP in fiscal year 2018 compared to 1.1% in fiscal year 2016, back-of-the-envelope calculations show (assuming annual growth of 11.4% and 4.1% in demand for petrol and diesel respectively, as has been observed in the year so far). Thus, a spike in oil price to around $70 per barrel is enough to strain our public finances and add 0.4% to the Centres fiscal deficit. This would be over and above the increasing expenditure obligations on interest, salaries and pensions, compounded by Seventh Pay Commission recommendations and OROP. Read more If the government wishes to keep petrol and diesel prices unchanged, without sacrificing its tax revenues, then it would have to resort to subsidies (or under-recoveries) as used to be the case in yesteryears. Thus, no matter the recourse adopted, government finances will most likely be hit severely if oil prices rise, unless the government allows the prices of petroleum products to rise. Besides posing risks for the governments finances and stoking the fires of inflation, a rise in oil prices would also worsen the current account deficit. Assuming crude oil prices at $70/barrel and pencilling a constant pace of rise in volumes in oil imports and exports, as seen in the current fiscal year so far, and keeping all other things constant, Indias current account deficit could widen to 1.7% of GDP in fiscal 2018 compared to 1.1% of GDP in fiscal 2016.Indias net oil and gas import bill, i.e. adjusting for exports of petroleum products, amounts to around 2.5% of GDP, higher than Indias overall current account deficit and hence plays a big role in determining the dynamics related to the balance of payments. Thus, if there is one commodity to watch out for in 2017, it is likely to be oil.",2017-01-18,ro8NqXjBC4gk1i2OAQdGYN,The entire reduction in Indias fiscal deficit over the past few years can be attributed to the fall in crude oil prices,08:51,Why oil can spoil Indias budget math
-0.17,"Singapore: Oil prices rose on Thursday, driven up by a weakening dollar, but gains were capped by plentiful supplies and inventories despite an effort by organisation of petroleum exporting countries (Opec) and other producers to cut output and prop up the market.
				   
				Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were trading at $55.56 per barrel at 1.31pm, up 48 cents, or 0.87%, from their last close.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $53.19 a barrel, up 43 cents, or 0.82%. Traders said that the gains were largely down to a weakening dollar, which has lost 3.9% in value since its January peak. Since oil is traded in dollar, a cheaper greenback makes fuel purchases less costly for countries using other currencies, potentially spurring demand.However, oil price gains were capped by data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) that showed an increase of 2.84 million barrels in commercial crude inventories to 488.3 million barrels, which add to a 6.3% rise in US oil production since the middle of last year to 8.96 million barrels per day (bpd).EIA estimates that crude oil and other liquids inventories grew by 2 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by an increase in production and a significant, but seasonal, drop in consumption, the agency said.Rising US inventories and output are countering efforts by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and other producers including Russia to cut supplies by a almost 1.8 million bpd during the first half of 2017 in an effort to end a global glut.Key customers in Asia are also being spared any significant cuts as producers fear losing market share to competitors.Crude supplies to Japan from its biggest supplier Saudi Arabia will not be impacted by last years agreement between Opec and non-Opec countries to cut output, Aabed Al-Saadoun, deputy minister for company affairs at Saudi Arabias Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources, said in Tokyo on Thursday.But Russia, which overtook Saudi Arabia as Chinas biggest supplier last year, is likely to remain Chinas top crude partner for some time as it prepares to expand its crude outflows via the Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline, energy consultancy BMI Research said in a report on Thursday. That comes as Saudi Arabia is set to cut supplies mainly of its medium-to-heavy grades to some customers in Asia, giving rival suppliers the opportunity to step in, the report added.

-0.26,"Mumbai: The Tata group, in an affidavit filed to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) board, strongly refuted charges levelled by Cyrus P. Mistry, the ousted chairman of Tata Sons, and said Mistry did a poor job of turning around companies such as Tata Steel Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd, resulting in a drop in dividends to the Tata Trusts, The Economic Times reported on Monday, citing the affidavit. 
				   
				It also said Mistry did not pay any heed to Ratan Tatas requests to keep his family business at a distance to avoid conflict of interests.The affidavit is a response to the petition filed by Mistry on 20 December. In his petition Mistry alleged mismanagement and oppression of minority shareholders of Tata Sons and seeking the ouster of the current management of Tata Sons and Tata Trusts. Ratan Tata, in a handwritten letter dated 24 September 2013, seemed alarmed by the conflict of interests between Mistrys family business and Mistrys position as chairman and, therefore, prodded Mistry to set up a so called blind Trust that will disassociate the latter from his Tata shareholding, and also not to have any transaction of business between Shapoorji Pallonji Group and Tata Group as long as Mistry was its chairman. Blind Trust is a popular concept abroad when individuals are keen to avoid any conflicts with another entity their firm has a relationship with. It allows the owner of the stake to relinquish the control of the company during the period when he has other responsibilities. Tata preferred handwritten notes in his correspondence with Mistry, reflecting his desire to keep differences strictly confidential, between him and his then successor. Even as Mistry was removed as the chairman of the $103 billion group only on 24 October 2016, the differences between Mistry and the then chairman emeritus Ratan Tata had surfaced as early as 2013, according to the 37-page affidavit.

The September quarter results announced after market hours that day showed a robust 41% year-on-year growth in its net profit to Rs102 crore. That compares favourably with a 19% net profit growth seen in the June quarter. 
				   
				One reason why the company was able to clock better profit growth is lower gas costs. Supported by the cut in domestic gas prices, the gas distributors Ebitda/scm was at Rs6.75 (FY16 at Rs5.78; June 2016 quarter at Rs6.7), pointed out Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd in a report on 28 November. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. SCM is standard cubic metres.For the September quarter, operating profit margin improved by an impressive 881 basis points to 31%; albeit slightly lower than the 31.5% operating margin clocked in the June quarter. But that shouldnt bother investors much. What augurs well is that further cuts in domestic gas prices are expected to support margins in the days to come. A basis point is 0.01%.The companys revenue (adjusted for excise duty) declined 3.4% compared to the same period last year. Volume traction though decelerated. Compressed natural gas (CNG) sales growth slowed down to 4.4% year-on-year (June quarter: 8% year-on-year) due to base effect and seasonal factors, Nitin Tiwari of Antique Stock Broking Ltd said in a note on 29 November. CNG sales in September 2015 quarter were strong at 1.87 million scm per day, about 9% higher sequentially, resulting in the base effect. The conversion of vehicles to CNG, though a tad weaker, however, continued the trend observed in 1Q, with a total conversion of ~19,200 vehicles (1Q: ~20,300) of which 7,348 (1Q: 10,700) were private cars, added Antique. Piped natural gas sales volume growth for the September quarter was a shade faster than the June one. But that wasnt enough to compensate.

They said the two countries are also planning a ceremony of first pour of concrete to the foundation of Unit 3 and 4 and a ceremony of inauguration of Unit 2 of the Kudankulam nuclear plant. Both ceremonies will witness the participation of Putin and Modi as well as Kudankulam engineers in Tamil Nadu via video-conference, they added. On 10 August, the first unit of the Kudankulam Nuclear was dedicated to the nation jointly by Modi and Putin who had participated at the ceremony from Moscow via video-conferencing. The Kudankulam 1 has been jointly built by the Nuclear Power Corporation of India and Russias Rosatom and it had started generating electricity in 2013.

0.78,"London: Tata Sons interim chairman Ratan Tata was on Sunday hailed as the saviour of the UK steel industry after the Tata Group announced a 10-year commitment of £1 billion investment to save thousands of jobs for its embattled steelworks in the country last week. 
				   
				In a special feature titled Man of Steel, the Sunday Times attributes the thousands of jobs saved in the industry largely to the sacking of Cyrus Mistry and Ratan Tata stepping in as interim chairman. Last weeks abrupt change of heart owes much to a terse board meeting in Mumbai on 24 October. At that meeting the board of Tata Sons, the parent company that sits astride an empire spanning steel to tea, sacked its chairman Cyrus Mistry and reinstated his predecessor Ratan Tata, the report said. Describing Ratan Tata as the architect of the £6.1-billion acquisition of Corus in 2007, it quotes insiders as saying that the 78-year-old tycoon was never comfortable with the idea of abandoning Tata Steels Welsh plant at Port Talbotthe UKs largest steelworks. Now he is back at the helm, Port Talbot has won a reprieve, it notes. Tata is said to have been painfully aware that the closure of Port Talbot would devastate the town already marred by poverty. As the head of the (Tata company) charity, Ratan is not like that. You dont want to get rid of vast chunks of people and create mass unemployment. Ratan was quite upset at the way he (Mistry) was dealing with Tata Steel. There were all these whispers that he (Ratan) did the wrong thing in buying Corus, the newspaper quotes an insider as saying. Nearly 11,000 British workers at Tata Steel have been rejoicing after the company has indicated that it would not take any dividends from its British plants until their profit tops £200 million a year. The company made the pledge last week as part of a plan that will keep the Port Talbot site in south Wales open until at least 2021. It promised no job cuts for five years and to pump £1 billion into its UK plants over 10 years. Tata said in a statement, The immediate target of £200 million provides sufficient funds to invest in the business and to manage working capital needs. However, beyond this level the business will balance the needs of all its stakeholders, including the financing of dividends.

0.23,"Mumbai: Even as the crisis at Tata group deepens the role and responsibility of independent directors (IDs) have come to the forefront as they take varied stance in different operating companies, dividing the board and adding to the drama facing the $103 billion group.
				   
				In a note released on Monday, titled Tata-Mistry: Shareholders vs board, battle for supremacy, proxy advisory firm Stakeholders Empowerment Services (SES) prods the independent directors to explain to the stakeholders their divergent views to remove all doubts about the subsequent events that have unfolded since the boardroom coup on 24 October.It also questions the manner in which Mistry was removed from his position as a chairman from the TCS board. In a notification to the exchanges, on 10 November, TCS informed the decision to appoint Ishat Hussain as chairman on the Board of TCS in place of Mistry. SES does not agree that powers of Board or decisions of Board can be changed by shareholders in this manner.Among other things, the report highlights the conflicting stand of some of the independent directors. For instance, Keki Dadiseth, an independent director at Indian Hotels Co. Ltd (IHCL) who applauded the performance of Mistry, is also a trustee of Sir Ratan Tata Trust (SRTT). SRTT is one of the two principal Tata Trusts which control two thirds in Tata Sons, it is also a shareholder in IHCL. It seems like (Mr). Keki Dadiseth has taken two different stands, one where he supports (Mr) Mistry, other where he was also involved in decision making process for replacing (Mr) Mistry as a Trustee of SRTT. Same is true for Narsee Munjee.said the report. SES said unless they come out and state the reason for their diverse views, doubts would remain.On the issue of removal of Nusli Wadia, SES pointed out that while legally Tata Sons has every right to seek removal of any director on board, be it independent director, executive director or otherwise, the issue is whether such an act is ethically right and would pass the benchmark of good governance.SES said it believed the independent directors and all other directors on the board should be driven by interest of the shareholders. Directors (including IDs) do not have the mandate or right to adjudicate and pronounce right or wrong, it said. A divided board, said SES, is not in the interest of the stakeholders and the foundation of collective responsibility cannot survive in a divided board. A divided board is like a vehicle with driver at both ends, each trying to move in his own direction. Division at board level unlike dissent, which reflects a healthy board, is counterproductive and destroys shareholder value.It is in real sense a testing time for them, said the report, alluding to independent directors. It questions the basis on which the independent directors of Indian Hotels and Tata Chemicals Ltd decided to back Mistry. Do they know the truth? If yes, please tell the same to all investors? If not, can they adjudicate based on letters of two sides and decide? Does their job involve adjudication? Are they competent for adjudication? questioned the report. In one way, according to SES, they are guilty of the same hurried decision, which Mistry is complaining of. Adjudication is a process and one cannot decide without serious application of mind taking into account all factors. Have IDs done that? the report asked further.SES, the report pointed out, has been of the view that the action of removing Mistry on an immediate basis was disproportionate to the cause attributed for the decision. Assuming it was based on non-performance, it is difficult to believe that non-performance could be an overnight development which assumed such an enormity that immediate action was required, it said.Indian corporates materially differ from the rest of the developed countries, especially those in the US and the UK, in their ownership structure. In India, almost all companies have a dominant shareholder called promoter. In the US and the UK, holding/ownership is generally dispersed and no one is a promoter, pointed out SES. By equating dominant shareholders at par with minority shareholders, the law has created mismatch of risks and rights.

0.55,"German multinational corporation SAP SE may be best known as an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software firm but senior executives insist that it has successfully moved beyond ERP to providing cloud computing and digital solutions as well.
				   
				Until about 2010, 70% of our revenue globally was from ERP. At the end of 2015, only about 30% of our revenue was from ERP and 70% was non-ERP, Deb Deep Sengupta, president and managing director, India subcontinent region, SAP, said in an interview.Sengupta acknowledged that while the benefits of ERP became visible in large enterprises, there was this perception that for a smaller company, SAPs technology is very hard to adopt and very expensive too. To address the issue, SAP India introduced many best practices from the implementations it had done in countries such as Brazil and Latin America. We created some packages for micro-verticals (small, specialized industry segments) and created an ecosystem of implementation partners that did not exist earlier, Sengupta said.SAP India also started working with agencies that do nation-building such as the railways, utility companies, ports and airports. We also worked a lot with the defence and home ministries, Sengupta added.In 2010, SAP launched its High-performance Analytic Appliance (HANA) software platform, which enables data processing in real or near-real time for quick business insights and improved decision-making. HANA can be deployed on premise or on the cloud, a model whereby firms do not spend upfront on licensing and equipment but pay on a per-use basis.SAP has also spent billions of dollars on acquiring firms whose solutions are cloud-centric. Some examples include Hybris, SuccessFactors, Ariba, Concur and Fieldglass. These, Sengupta said, have helped SAP rise to the world No. 2 spot in terms of revenue from cloud computing applications in 2015. Globally, we now have over 200 million users on the cloud.Even the core ERP, now christened S/4HANA has been completely re-tooled. In less than a year since its launch in 2015, we have deployed this solution in more than 2,700 companies. It is available on the cloud and on-premise. You can also deploy it in a hybrid model, Sengupta said.The 20.8-billion company, which has about 8,000 employees in India, does not give a break-up of its India revenue, but Dataquesta Cyber Media (India) Ltd publicationpegged the companys India revenue at Rs10,705 crore in fiscal 2015-16.SAP dominates the ERP software market in India; Dataquest reporting its market share at about 47%. Its product portfolio includes analytics, customer relationship management (CRM), expense management, human capital management and business-to-business commerce.The key verticals for SAP in India, according to Sengupta, are manufacturing, consumer goods, professional services and public services. Banking, financial services and insurance is another rapidly-growing vertical for the company, even though competitor Oracle Corp. leads in this space.For Sengupta, digital is not just about the front end; its an integrated thing. Its about the experience, which well provide. He observed that while digital firms are building an offline presence, physical ones are going digital too, known as the phygital trend. Sengupta cited the examples of US sportswear brand Under Armour and the multi-brand digital marketplace of the Tata group in India, Tata CLiQ, as examples of companies going phygital. To cater to this need, SAP announced the launch of the SAP Digital Boardroom in October 2015. According to Sengupta, the boardroom is a digital approach that aims to contextualize and simplify performance reporting across all areas of business in real time. Built on the SAP Cloud for Analytics Solution, the SAP Digital Boardroom incorporates fully automated business intelligence capabilities that aim to dramatically improve the quality and speed of reporting as well as collaboration in real time.SAP is also providing cutting-edge technology solutions to its clients. For instance, it has around 100 engineers working on machine learning, and that team is constantly expanding, said a 1 December 2016 report by research firm Market Realist. SAP is hoping to leverage machine learning to strengthen its cloud-based human resources suite SuccessFactors. Besides machine learning, SAP has also stepped up its investments to drive blockchain innovation. Blockchain is the technology that underlies cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Zcash.If SAP succeeds in its machine learning efforts, it could reduce competition for its products and pave the way for more revenue, the Market Realist report said. But it also cautioned that SAPs aggressive push into machine learning would put the firm on a collision course with Alphabet Inc. (parent of Google Inc.), which is also heavily into artificial intelligence research.The Internet of Things (IoT) is another area of focus for SAP; it announced an investment of 2 billion over five years in the IoT segment. As part of this plan, SAP acquired Plat.Onean IoT services providerlast September.To be sure, SAP will have its fair share of challenges in the coming years, especially in cloud computing, said analysts. For one, SAP does not have its own data centre in India yet. Sengupta pointed out that SAP is tying up with local partners for cloud services in India, but analysts remained sceptical.The growth has been easy for SAP in India when it came to the top 100 enterprises and then another 300-odd large companies, but the joy ride ends now, said Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst and CEO of Greyhound Research. He pointed out that Indian firms are wary about data residing in a foreign country. Gogia added that SAP has not found many takers for its expensive HANA. Though some enterprises have technically bought HANA licences, there are only a few of implementations in the country, as not all ERP modules are ready yet on HANA. Another reason for the lukewarm response to HANA is the lack of skill sets on HANA in India, Gogia noted.The upcoming goods and services tax (GST) regime, which would need ERP to be modified or upgraded for compliance, could also pose a challenge for SAP, Gogia said. While SAP is mandating its clients to buy S/4HANA licences if they want to migrate their existing SAP solution to a GST-compatible version, other vendors are offering to supply the GST patch for free, Gogia noted, warning that firms may shift their custom to other vendors as they embrace GST.The competition is undoubtedly stiff with the likes of Amazon Web Services (AWS), CenturyLink, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and Salesforce offering public cloud platforms. AWS and Microsoft lead the pack among global public cloud platform providers for enterprise developers. IBM and Google offer competitive options. Oracle, Salesforce, CenturyLink and SAP lag behind, according to a 29 August 2106 report by Forrester analysts Dave Bartoletti and John R. Rymer.Among the megacloud providers, SAP is a challenger, the report said. The analysts pointed out that while the HANA cloud platforms greatest strength is in shielding developers from all infrastructure configuration tasks when working with SAP business suites, companies must determine whether the platform is a good choice to also build and deploy applications that are independent of SAPs business suites since the HANA cloud platform offers only a limited set of application development and delivery functions. SAP, according to analysts, is yet to step up to the full range of language run times, databases, and analytics services of the leaders, although SAP recently released an IoT service to all customers. As a new entrant in the market, SAPs partner roster for HANA cloud platform is small, as is adoption of its platform, the report concluded.",2017-01-16,uLYxZE6K7ZZ85besrpDTIK,"SAP, the German ERP software company, has successfully made inroads into cloud computing and digital solutions",00:42,SAP: The road beyond ERP
0.84,"In what may help reduce wind energy tariffs in the country, the 1 gigawatt (GW) tender floated by state-run Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI) has received 2.6 times the quantum of bids offered for the grid linked capacity.
				   
				Experts say this may potentially bring down wind energy tariffs which currently ranges from Rs3.9 per unit to Rs5.9 per unit.The industry is eagerly awaiting the outcome, said a wind energy developer participating in the auction process, requesting anonymity.Another clean energy developer who also requested anonymity said, There is a possibility that the tariffs may fall as low as sub Rs4 per unit.Bids totaling 2,600 MW have been received from 13 companies including Adani Power, Hero Future Energies Pvt. Ltd, Renew Power and Inox Wind for the two-stage processtechnical and financial. Those qualifying the technical bid stage will be eligible for the financial bid stage. Once, the financial bids are opened, a reverse bid auction process will be run to select the developers. The last date for the bid submission was 9 January.2,600 MW is the maximum bids received. The final award can be less than that. Financial bids are yet to be opened, said Ashvini Kumar, managing director, SECI, declining to identify the companies who have taken part in the bidding process. In India, which is the biggest greenhouse gas emitter after the US and China, renewable energy currently accounts for 15%, or 45,917 MW, of the total installed capacity of 3,10,005 MW. Of this wind energy projects alone account for 28,083 MW, placing it at fourth position after China, the US and Germany. In the long run, the price difference between wind and solar will go. Now whether that happens in this tender or the next one (remains to be seen); they (wind and solar) will be competitive, Kumar said while adding that the final tender will be awarded within the next two to three weeks.Spokespersons for Inox Power and Hero Future Energies confirmed their participation in the tender.Queries emailed to spokespersons for Adani Power and  Renew Power remained unanswered at press time. India plans to achieve 175GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022 as part of its climate commitments; wherein it has promised to achieve 40% of its electricity generation capacity from non-fossil fuel based energy resources by 2030. This includes 60 GW from wind power, 100 GW from solar power, 10 GW from biomass and 5 GW from small hydro projects.While remaining hopeful, experts sounded caution on the 1000 MW wind energy project tender.Just as the solar tariffs have benefited from lower panel prices, wind tariffs will also optimise as the auction will create pricing pressure on WTG (wind turbine generator) suppliers. However, given that 70% of the bids are from Tamil Nadu, a high wind regime, the tariffs from this process should not be considered as a benchmark by lower wind regime states going forward. Overall, this is a good initiative and the sector will benefit from this auction, said Srishti Ahuja, director, at consulting firm EY.This comes at a time when the wind energy sector is grappling with issues such as squatters on good wind potential sites, inordinate delays in signing of power purchase agreements and untimely payments, and distribution firms shying away from procuring electricity generated from wind energy projects. The other pertinent issues are: proper scheduling and forecasting of wind energy, availability of transmission facilities and rationalisation of transmission tariffs for wind energy projects.The union government has called a national review meet of states and the nodal agencies for ironing out issues plaguing the green energy sector as reported by Mint on Friday(bit.ly/2iquTy0)India has a wind power potential of around 302 GW at 100 meter hub-height.",2017-01-16,uNn22FVohHnlCNsOtJz4EO,"The development may potentially bring down wind energy tariffs, which currently range from Rs3.9 per unit to Rs5.9 per unit, say experts",00:19,SECIs 1GW wind power tender sees high interest
1.0,"New Delhi: The board of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd(ONGC) on Thursday will consider issuing a bonus share to increase liquidity ahead of government disinvestment. 
				   
				With all of its about Rs14,000 crore cash committed in future projects and capital expenditure, the company is considering issuing bonus shares rather than cash dividends as a method of providing income to shareholders. The board on 27 October will consider the second quarter financial results as well as consider a proposal for declaration of bonus issue, the company said in a regulatory filing. Issuing bonus shares increases the issued share capital of the company, which is then perceived as being bigger than it really is, making it more attractive to investors. When a company issues bonus shares, the price of its existing shares comes down by about the same ratio as the bonus shares that have been issued. So, if the bonus issue is 1:1, which means they are issuing one additional share for each existing share, the market price of the share will roughly halve. ONGC had in December 2010 issued 1:1 bonus share along with a special dividend of Rs32 per share and a stock split. At that point, ONGC equity share of Rs10 face value was split into two of Rs5 face value. This was done as a precursor to the companys planned follow-on public offer (FPO) in the following year. The government is considering divesting at least 5% of its shares through an FPO this fiscal to raise about Rs12,500 crore. Prior to that, the company had in 2006 issued a 1:2 bonus issue.

-0.5,"London/ New York: The promise of production cuts from Opec and its partners sent oil rallying in 2016. Now traders want proof theyre delivering on those vows. It wont come easy.
				   
				The challenge: building a coherent picture from the morass of data that emerges at each step along the process, from the wellheads where the oil is produced, to the tankers that carry it, and the depots that store it.Unlike in the US, where output is published weekly, members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Opec, can take months to disclose their production. Beyond that, their data can be at odds with independent surveys, and countries have been known to cheat on such deals. With a rising US rig count offering a bearish undertone, each new hint on the accords implementation can be expected to swing prices.The market could be whipsawed more by data and headlines than in the past, said Michael Cohen, head of energy commodities research at Barclays Plc in New York, in a telephone interview. Data lags will be the primary problem in tracking cuts.Brent crude, the global benchmark, has surged 23% since 29 November, the day before the deal was sealed among Opecs members. The grade was trading at $56.86 a barrel at 1.07pm in Singapore. Future price increases for crude future will depend on a wide variety of signposts. Heres a breakdown on what to look for:UpstreamThe first indications will come at the start of next month, when media outlets such as Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters and Platts publish surveys of production. Estimates from institutions such as the International Energy Agency and US Energy Information Administration arrive a week or two later.As no ones counting barrels at Abqaiq, the Saudi oil-processing facility, these have to be modelled on computers, Barclays Cohen says. While we consider official production data published by Opec governments, we come up with our own estimates, said Lejla Villar, an analyst who estimates Opec output at the EIA, part of the US Energy Department. We look at crude oil loadings, estimated domestic consumption and refinery runs, storage, and whatever else might be relevant.Opec wont publish production levels until the middle of next month. Even then, the waters will be muddied as the organization provides two sets of data: the one used to monitor the agreement, compiled from the surveys described above, and numbers submitted directly by member governments, which can differ significantly.Monitoring the 11 non-members collaborating in the deal could be even harder, as data for the smaller producers like South Sudan and Equatorial Guinea are very patchy.At the moment its hard to be sure how much announced production cuts have been followed or matched by actual changes, said Damian Kennaby, director in the oil markets team at IHS Markit Ltd, whose estimates are among the external ones used by Opec. There are very few data on current production numbers and balances.To provide more clarity, Opec and its partners have established a monitoring committee, to hold its first meeting in Vienna from 21 January to 22 January, though the panel hasnt yet said ind detail how it will operate.MidstreamWhile the agreement applies to production, changes in exports will be felt more acutely by the international oil market. National producers notify customers months in advance what cargoes are available, which means some details on exports are already known. Iraqs shipping schedules, for instance, show the countrys sales will increase rather than decrease next month, though the country subsequently said buyers should prepare for lower volumes.Once the oil is on the water theres a range of services dedicated to following its flow, from ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg to companies such as Petro-Logistics SA and Oil Movements. Satellite-tracking means these shipments can be estimated almost in real-time.Still, a drop in exports might not guarantee a change in production, according to the EIA.The question of storage is the key unknown when estimating production using export data, said the EIAs Villar. Its difficult to know how much of the lifted crude each month comes from storage and how much from production in that particular month. Furthermore the size of the cuts, at just 4% of Opecs total output, is not necessarily enough to have an impact on the number of tankers, said Olivier Jakob, managing director at consultants Petromatrix GmbH.StockpilesClearing bloated oil inventories, rather than achieving a particular price, has always been the stated aim of Opecs intervention. The group estimates that the worlds tanks are overstuffed by more than 300 million barrels, or enough to satisfy China for almost a month.Yet if stockpiles are the most important metric, the problem is that they are perhaps the most lagging, with data from the IEA arriving about two months in arrears.The agency previously assumed inventories wouldnt drop until the end of 2017. It now estimates that Opecs cuts could start to deplete inventories as early as the first quarter, which means data from this definitive gauge would arrive in April or May. Opec, meanwhile, has said that while the deal will speed up the re-balancing of the global oil market, it wont result in demand exceeding supply until the second half of the year.Even if Opec delivers the cuts promised, theres still the risk of backsliding if their competitors in the US respond by ramping up drilling, said Chip Hodge, who oversees a $12 billion natural-resource bond portfolio as senior managing director at John Hancock in Boston. If activity picks up dramatically here, it might push other producers into cheating because of what that means for prices, he said.

The stock has fallen 8% in the last two weeks, while year-to-date is down 1.11%.Recently, the government slapped a $1.55 billion fine on RIL and its partners BP Plc. and Niko Resources Ltd, for extracting gas from state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltds (ONGCs) deep-water block in the Krishna-Godavari basin for seven years.However, RIL said it is planning to initiate arbitration against the government. RIL remains convinced of being able to fully justify and vindicate its position that the governments claim is not sustainable, the company said in a emailed statement on 4 November.We felt that the penalty, if any, that RIL could be liable to pay should be limited to the net cumulative earnings before interest and taxes (Ebit) earned by it from the disputed volumes, which we had estimated at Rs16 billion. This is far lower than the $1.55 billion imposed by the government (the latter is admittedly a gross number, which should be $1.15bn net to RIL, in our view), said Citi research report in a note to its investors on 6 November.This effectively almost equals the total revenues earned from the sale of these gas volumes (ie, without allowing operating expense and  capital expenditure to be deducted). Even without getting into the merits and justification of the governments action, the calculation itself in our view appears flawed and the resultant penalty appears grossly exaggerated, the report added.",2016-11-11,utsUY3oQipb6v2Zmz1JxTI,"HDFC Bank with a market value of  Rs3,25 trillion, follows Tata Consultancy Services , which is Indias most valuable company with a market capitalisation of Rs4.14 trillion",16:39,HDFC Bank beats RIL to become Indias 2nd biggest firm by market capitalisation 
1.0,"State-run refining and marketing companies (OMCs)Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL)have all delivered strong June quarter results. 
				   
				A key reason why these companies were able to perform better is the fact that they reported a better gross refining margin (GRM).For the quarter, the measure for IOC, HPCL and BPCL stood at $9.98 a barrel, $6.83 a barrel and $6.09 a barrel, respectively.GRM is a measure of profitability for refining companies. In general, GRMs of refining companies were expected to get a boost from inventory gains, thanks to the rising oil price trend over the quarter. That has panned out. Spark Capital Advisors (India) Pvt. Ltd says, adjusted for refining inventory gains, the GRMs for these companies were in the range of $4-5 a barrel. Thats not very impressive.Nevertheless, the results beat street expectations.IOCs operating profit increased by one-third, compared with the same period last year to Rs.13,683 crore. HPCLs operating profit increased 17% year-on-year to Rs.3,627 crore, while BPCLs operating profit increased at a much slower pace of 3% to Rs.3,919 crore.Reported net profit of IOC, HPCL and BPCL increased 25%, 30% and 11%, respectively, to Rs.8,269 crore, Rs.2,098 crore and Rs.2,620 crore.What next after a great quarter? Investors in these stocks have little to complain. Higher visibility on profits thanks to reforms in the sector, benefits from lower crude price and robust demand have helped sentiment. So far this year, shares of these companies have outperformed the Sensex meaningfully. Currently, BPCL, HPCL and IOC trade at 11 times, nine times and 10 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year.Even as valuations do not appear demanding, the outlook isnt the brightest. Spark Capital believes OMCs earnings have peaked out in fiscal 2016 and sees risks to 2HFY17/FY18E earnings. Some factors that pose risks, according to the brokerage, include weaker GRMs and narrowing of trade discounts offered by West Asian suppliershitting GRMs and normalization in marketing margins of auto fuels.Further, while the June quarter was supported by strong inventory gains, a similar support in the current quarter is unlikely. In fact, it is possible that the June quarter ends up being the best quarter for this year. Given this and the sharp run-up in the stocks, upsides in the OMC stocks could be capped.",2016-09-04,vwgz8rEb7fUq3xkuRqZFXK,"While the June quarter was supported by strong inventory gains, a similar support in the current quarter is unlikely, according to some analysts",20:18,Inventory gains boost oil marketing companies in June quarter
0.24,"Singapore: Japan Inc. is getting a raw deal in India. Some of its high-profile investments in the country have created more wealth for arbitration lawyers in London and Singapore than they have for shareholders. Those who were expecting great things from the bromance between Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi have reasons to be disappointed.
				   
				Two soured deals are NTT Docomo Inc.s $2.2 billion investment in an Indian wireless venture with the Tata Group, and the $4.6 billion Daiichi Sankyo Co. shelled out to buy Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd, a generic drugmaker. Almost a decade on, the Japanese companies have won claims to compensation via international arbitration proceedings, but in neither case is there any sign of a check in the mail.The Docomo dispute might be quicker to resolve. Ratan Tata, who recently reclaimed control of the conglomerate in a boardroom putsch, is reportedly keen to settle. It was he who had promised to buy out Docomo at a 50% loss on its original investment in five years.But when the Japanese tried to exercise their put option in 2014, the Indian group contended that in local law, a guaranteed exit price would become unwelcome foreign debt masquerading as equity, therefore, the Tatas could neither honour their commitment, nor fulfil the arbitration award the Japanese company won last year in London.ALSO READ: Tata-Mistry ties strained further with Tata Motors 2015 rights issue: AffidavitDaiichi Sankyos misery began when it acquired Ranbaxy from brothers Malvinder Singh and Shivinder Singh in 2008. Shortly after, US regulators barred more than 30 drugs made at two of the Indian companys plants and also halted reviews of new products at one of the factories because the company had falsified data. In May last year, the Singapore International Arbitration Centre awarded Daiichi a $376 million claim against the Singh brothers for suppressing facts, which had cost Ranbaxy an expensive settlement with the US regulator. Japan Inc.s total outbound mergers and acquisitions (M&A) last year stood at $79.7 billion.That victory doesnt mean much. The siblings are contending that the Singapore award is invalid under Indian law. Daiichi, which has already exited India at a loss, is now hoping the courts there will stop the Singh brothers from selling a stake in their hospital chain Fortis Healthcare Ltd before settling their claim. Earlier this month, Mint reported that KKR & Co. was in talks with the brothers to buy Fortis, which has an enterprise value of $1.5 billion. In a new twist, Daiichi claims it just found out that one of the Singh brothers investment companies it sued to recover the money from no longer exists.The longer such wrangles linger, the stronger the impression that Indias local laws make it impossible to settle commercial disputes with foreigners. Japanese firms arent the most ambitious of dealmakers in emerging markets anyway. Their total acquisitions in Brazil, Russia, India and China have amounted to just $25 billion over the past six years, of which Indias share has been $4.4 billion. By contrast, American companies spent $5.1 billion shopping in India last year.Abe wants the coyness to end and hopes for a big role in Indias railway modernization. However, for long-gestation infrastructure projects, sanctity of contract enforcement will be even more important. New Delhis tax regime is already a minefield.

0.25,"Mumbai:  The Tata group fracas appears to have shed all earthly inhibitions and gone to a galaxy far, far away. In this Star Wars space opera, Cyrus Mistry, the recently ousted chairman, was Sith Lord Darth Vader who had brainwashed the PR folk  the old and venerable conglomerates noble Jedi warriors  and used them to smother criticism of his performance.
				   
				Thats probably why a 24 September Economist report, titled Mistrys Elephant, which was denounced by the group for drawing preconceived conclusions based on an inappropriate interpretation of selected data, was on Thursday extolled by the same people for being really a well-balanced and critical review.Not just that. Thursdays press statement ticked off the groups PR machineryin other words, itselffor dismissing views that did not toe the line being peddled by Bombay House, Tatas headquarters. Even the author of the Economist report is baffled by the sudden change of heart.Stanley Pignal @spignal Im fascinated to see Tata denouncing its own PR machines response to my recent article. Odd given PR side is/was https://t.co/gCbxA6z7EB Twitter: Stanley Pignal on TwitterAs for investors who have seen more than $12 billion of their Tata group wealth vanish since 24 October, the day Ratan Tata reclaimed control, only three questions really matter:Whos the Chosen One to restore balance to the Force? How many episodes are left? Wheres the popcorn?The answer to the first is far from obvious. Ratan Tatas camp is now accusing Mistry of trying to hijack control of operating companies in the $100 billion salt-to-software conglomerate. Mistrys side says the allegations are untrue. Tata is mocking Mistrys poor leadership for botching up Tata Steel Ltds UK operations, claiming that the Scunthorpe steel plant it sold in May to Greybull Capital LLP for 1 British pound has since seen a dramatic turnaround. Mistry, on the other hand, blames Ratan Tatas $12.9 billion purchase of Corus Group Plcs steel assets in 2007 for the groups debt overhang.Tata Consultancy share-price declined 13% since Ratan returned . Since Ratan Tata is back only in an interim capacity, the group needs a new chairman to end the spat. But until Mistry agrees to sell his familys 18.4% holding in Tata Sons Ltd., the holding company, the lightsabers wont get turned off. Its unlikely that the CEO of a global corporation would want to jump into the fray as Luke Skywalkerand get his or her reputation fried in the process. Besides, after Tata Groups press statement accused Mistry of dismantling structures put in place by visionary founders and generations of Tatas, its not even clear if the group wants to be anything other than a family-run enterprise.Its a much more than just a war of words. Ratan Tata is trying to evict Mistry from the boards of operating companies, but its proving to be far from easy thanks to a few independent directors whore supporting Mistry. But are those directors taking up the cudgels to uphold corporate governance standards, or are they simply trying to avoid the embarrassment of firing a chairman after showering praises on him?Like in everything else with the Tata Wars, its impossible to establish whos with the Force and whos gone over to the Dark Side. Or for that matter, how many more episodes are left in the sordid saga. The best investors can hope for is that until the group makes up its mind on whether it wants to slash debt, gun for growth, or do a bit of both, Tata Consultancy Services , the groups ATM, will keep coughing up more cash so Bombay House can fully engage in the tussle for control.

0.81,"Petronet LNG Ltd is reaping the benefits of shortage of locally produced gas. Lower domestic gas production has meant improved demand for imported liquefied natural gas (LNG). In fact, in April-August 2016, LNG imports to India have risen about 26% year-on-year, according to Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell. Considering that domestic gas production is not going to improve overnight, the outlook for LNG is bright. Further, it helps that expected global LNG supply is likely to be more than demand, ensuring lower prices for some more time. In that backdrop, Petronet LNG, a company that imports LNG, finds itself in a sweet spot.
				   
				Its share price has surged an impressive 49% so far this fiscal year. Not without reason. For one, the company has brought forward the completion of 5 million tonne per annum (mtpa) capacity expansion at Dahej to October from its earlier guidance of end-2016. That will take the total capacity at Dahej to 15 mtpa.Unlike the Kochi terminal, Dahej has uninterrupted pipeline access and the lowest regas charges, pointed out analysts from IIFL Institutional Equities, adding that weak LNG prices will foster speedier terminal ramp-up. Use-or-Pay contracts and customer advances shield Petronet LNG from volatility in gas prices and demand, said IIFL analysts in a report on 29 September. Under use-or-pay contract, the customer will have to pay even if cargoes are not taken.If demand remains strong, Dahej could have a volume of 14 mt in FY17, said analysts from Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd in a report on 16 September. The brokerage firms current FY17 Dahej volume assumption is 13 mt. Each 1 mt in higher volume results in 9% higher earnings per share, according to Nomura.Petronet LNGs June quarter results were strong. Capacity utilization at its Dahej terminal increased to as much as 130% during the quarter from 111% in the March quarter. The company processed its highest ever volume in the June quarter. The September quarter, too, is expected to be strong.Given the above scenario, it is not surprising that the stock has outperformed the benchmark Sensex and the BSE Oil and Gas index so far this fiscal year. Currently, it trades at 22 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year. Thats not cheap. Moreover, concerns on underutilization of Petronet LNGs Kochi terminal remain, thanks to pipeline connectivity problems.

And some brokerages have started raising red flags about it. Cement companies should brace for some erosion at the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) level in the September quarter due to hardening fuel costs.
				   
				Data provided by S&P Global Platts shows that globally, the prices of thermal coal, the FOB Richards Bay 6,000 kcal/kg, surged from $50.283/mt in the beginning of the year to $62.445/mt in July. Richards Bay 6,000 kcal/kg NAR (net as received) is a grade bought by Indian buyers, especially cement companies. The chart represents the monthly average price of this grade of coal on a free-on-board (FOB) basis. This is the price the buyer pays to purchase coal and get the cargo loaded on to a mother vessel at Richards Bay Coal Terminal in South Africa.Similarly, average petroleum coke, or petcoke, prices rose from $45/mt in January this year to $81/mt in August. Supramax cargo of imported petcoke with typical 6.5% sulphur is delivered to Indias east coast port of Krishnapatnam. S&P Global Platts has been tracking the price of petcoke delivered to India on a weekly basis from March 2015 and this is highest price since then.Petcoke prices were trading at about close to $40/mt CFR India (CFR=cost and freight) in March this year. Cement companies found this price very attractive and started procuring in huge quantities, shifting from thermal coal. In fiscal 2016, total India petcoke imports stood between 3.5-4 million tonnes . But this year, in July alone, more than 1 million tonne of petcoke arrived in India, Deepak Kannan, managing editor, Asia Thermal Coal, S&P Global Platts told Mint.Maintenance issues with a few US refineries earlier this year tightened supply while demand continued to rise, leading to a steep increase in petcoke prices, while thermal coal prices have been driven by supply cuts and a shift in demand, he added.According to some experts, while it is certain that margins will begin to erode from hereon, it is difficult to quantify the exact impact now because some cement companies may have petcoke inventories acquired at low cost. Also, the hit on margins would vary from one company to another based on their usage of petcoke and coal.In the last three months, domestic petcoke prices have surged from Rs.1,200-1,500/tonne and players like ACC, Ambuja and UltraTech have increased petcoke usage to 60-75%; hence, operating cost is expected to harden from current quarter. Considering 50% of impact in current quarter, power and fuel cost is likely to surge by Rs.50-100/tonne. Further, increase in crude price also has an impact on packaging costs. However, looking at price trend of first two months of 2QFY17E, average price tends to be higher by 2-3% year-on-year, which may provide a cushion and arrest margin erosion, an analyst with Reliance Securities said.Further, Kannan cautioned that as the monsoon season ends, Indian buyers are expected to come back into the market for restocking, but they are staring at very high coal prices.The second quarter of the fiscal year is a seasonally weak one for this industry.

0.38,"Cement companies have announced price hikes in some regions in anticipation of good demand after the end of the rainy season. While prices are increased around this time every year, this time around it also has to do with a steep surge in petroleum coke (petcoke) prices.
				   
				In any case, the price hikes are hardly anything to get excited about, especially keeping in mind where valuations of cement stocks are.But first, it must be noted that the recent hikes are on expected lines, and may be enough to only cover increased costs. A recent ICICI Securities Ltd report said petcoke prices have risen by nearly 80% over the past six months, which is likely to impact margins in a seasonally weak period, and the brokerage firm expects it to be passed on to consumers in the medium term. Companies have announced price hikes of Rs10-50/bag across most regions in September 2016 mainly on reversal of price fall during monsoon, the report added.Prices in western, eastern and southern parts of India have seen a rise while prices in central and northern India remain more or less stable, say some analysts. Some experts such as Amey Joshi, associate director at India Ratings and Research Pvt. Ltd, say that prices may increase further in October. At that time, many companies would be looking at replenishing their petcoke stocks at an increased price, and hence would pass on the increase in costs to customers, he says. While a hike in prices to cover the increase in costs is welcome, it is clearly not enough to support the record valuations of cement companies. In a report titled, Testing the upper bands of optimism, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities write, Cement valuations continue to scale new peaks, meaningfully higher than historical bands and despite optimistic earnings assumptions that carry downside risks. Large cement companies have rarely breached the 15X EV/EBITDA on one-year forward estimates over the past decade, and accordingly, we see no scope for multiple re-rating from here. EV is  short for enterprise value while Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.In the near term, the seasonally weak second quarter of fiscal year will end in a few days from now and some analysts have already cautioned about subdued performance from cement companies, especially on the operating margins front due to increase in fuel costs, which could lead to a short-term correction in these stocks.Though some experts maintain that the second half of the year will be better for cement companies, the impact of the aforesaid price rise and whether or not the much-anticipated revival in demand has happened, remains to be seen.The fact that the industrys capacity utilization is currently low at less than 70%, it does leave ample room for volume growth, especially if a strong economic recovery is on the cards. But that cant be taken as a given, especially if capacity additions are higher than expected. Again, current valuations assume strong growth and much more. Kotaks analysts write, The pitfalls of poor earnings predictability may make asset-based valuation a suitable alternative check on valuations. Our analysis of gross block addition for the large cement companies and their individual capex plans, suggest capex of Rs 5.5 bn/mtpa (US$84/ton at spot rate) and transaction multiples of US$115-140/ton, (which is) significantly lower than trading multiples of US$127-304/ton for pan-India companies.",2016-09-19,ylAw4aKIaVgwuFWRkThqFN,"While cement prices are increased around this time every year, this time around it also has to do with a steep surge in petroleum coke (petcoke) prices",23:28,Cement price hikes on expected lines
0.44,"Mumbai:  It is, said a bewildered employee of Indias biggest company, very un-Tata-like.
				   
				The dynastic business that built a reputation over more than a century for discretion, integrity and fair-dealing has sunk into a public spat of allegations and name-calling. Its directors trade barbs. Its share price is tumbling. And on Friday, executives were jostled in the street while security staff engaged in an unseemly brawl outside Bombay House, the groups revered headquarters.How did it come to this?The drama dissecting Tata Sons, Indias largest industrial group, revolves around Ratan Tata, scion of a family that built an empire so diverse that it writes financial software for Goldman Sachs Group Inc., sells pick-up trucks in Uganda and offers packaged salt to Indian families at Rs.18 a kilo.Two weeks ago, Ratan Tata threw the group into confusion and the public spotlight after the Tata Sons board sacked his successor as chairman, Cyrus Mistry, and wrested back control for the 78-year-old. Neither Tata nor any other board member or major investor has suggested that Mistry financially mismanaged the group. He remains head of many of the affiliate companies, such as Tata Motors and Tata Steel.Instead, Mistrys ouster was the result of growing discontent from Tata, who ran the company for two decades, at what he considered was an undermining of the Tata brand, according to people who have worked with both and asked not to be named because the matter is private.Egos have been bruised, said Harsh Goenka, chairman of RPG Group, another Mumbai-based conglomerate. He said the Tata name stands for humility, humaneness, benevolence, grace and boldness of vision, and it has been dented by the current conflict.Since Mistrys removal as group chairman, Tatas more than two dozen listed companies have lost in excess of $8 billion in market value. Ratan Tata didnt respond to a recent request for an interview.Brand TataTatas adherence to the idea of the brand being a byword for integrity has run throughout his career, according to interviews with more than a dozen people who have worked with him. Banks would routinely do business based on Tatas word, and once he committed to doing something, he would see it through no matter what, said a person with knowledge of some of his deals.When Tata Steel bid for Corus Plc in 2006, it arranged financing with three banks for around $5 billion to $6 billion, said the person, who asked not to be named because the negotiations were private. As the price rose in a bidding war for the European steelmaker, Tata officials found cheaper funding, but would have to pay a break fee with the original banks of about £80 million ($99 million). Some executives tried to negotiate a cheaper release, but when the matter was brought to the attention of Ratan Tata, he insisted the original contract be honoured, the person said.Tatas decision echoes the groups current spat with Japanese telecommunication partner NTT Docomo Inc., which is one of the key battlegrounds in the war of words between Tata and Mistry. Docomo is trying to enforce a London Court of International Arbitration decision ordering Tata Sons to pay $1.17 billion for failing to uphold a contract, signed during Ratan Tatas 21-year period at the helm.A Tata Sons spokesman declined to comment while Mistrys office referred to a 1 November statement on the companys partnership with NTT Docomo.Tata became frustrated at Mistrys seeming reluctance to pay, which reflected on the Tata name, according to people familiar with the case. In an email to the directors after his removal, Mistry said it was the board that has not covered itself with glory, by the way he was dismissed.Family codeBut the Tata family code, rigorously pursued by Ratan Tatas predecessor, the legendary industrialist, aviator and philanthropist J.R.D. Tata, extends far beyond just sticking to your word.J.R.D., whose portrait looked down from the boardroom wall in Bombay House as Mistry was being ousted, made Tata famous for refusing to pay bribes. He founded many of the businesses that are now key units, such as Tata Motors, and funnelled a large chunk of profits to social programs such as Asias first cancer hospital and the Tata Institute for Social Sciences.He handpicked Ratan, the great grandson via his adopted father of group founder Jamsetji Tata, to carry on that family legacy. Trained as an architect at Cornell University, Ratan began on the shop floor in 1962, stoking Tata Steels blast furnaces, before gaining experience in several positions in the group.In 1991, he took over the chairmanship and set about establishing his dominance over group companies, which had become rich and autonomous during J.R.D.s five-decade reign.In the 1990s the Tata Group was ruled by powerful satraps and he very dexterously distanced all of them from their powerful positions and gained total control, said Goenka, chairman of RPG. The one common factor that defines Ratan Tata then and now is that of an astute leader. He eased out Cyrus Mistry from the chairmanship that took India Inc. completely by surprise. If the past was about a loud war cry, the present is about stealth.During his first chairmanship, Tata expanded the company rapidly, often by acquisition, turning a predominately India business into a global group with $103 billion in salesahead of Gazprom and International Business Machines Corp. He also sowed the seeds for many of the groups current troubles, including the purchase of Corus, the venture with Docomo and the ill-fated Nano car project.Since about 2004, with the question of his succession looming, Tata gradually increased his control in the operations of the group, said a person who worked closely with both Mistry and Tata. He took major decisions with less board consultation than previously, the person said.Ratan Tata has always consulted senior executives in all his decisions, including the Corus acquisition, said a Tata official, who asked not to be identified citing company rules.New successorThe eventual choice for a successor was Mistry, the son of one of the biggest shareholders in Tata Sons, his own brother-in-law and a fellow member of the Parsi communitythe isolated followers of Zoroastrianism whose ancestors fled to India from Persia a millennium ago.With Mistry deposed, Tata is back at the helm promising to find a new successor before March. Next month he will be 79.I do not think Ratan Tata has any option other than to hold on to the position that he has taken back, whether he likes it or not, said Kavil Ramachandran, executive director of the Thomas Schmidheiny Centre for Family Enterprise at the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad. In the interest of every stakeholder, he has to take steps to get the situation back on track.While Ratan took the groups products to more than 100 countries, he retained the ethos of his predecessors, that in building a business you are also helping to build India.Nano InspirationThe Nano was inspired by seeing an Indian family riding on a motorbike in the rain. It epitomized Ratan Tatas qualitieshis vision and attention to detail, as well as his stubbornness and reluctance to terminate a key business thats losing money.Tata spent hours with the Nano development team, focusing on getting every detail right for the most anticipated auto release of 2008, said a person who worked on the project. Yet the car was marketed as cheap, a stigma that was reinforced by dealers who had little interest in pushing a low-margin vehicle.When Mistry led the introduction of Tata Motors latest modelthe unfortunately named Zica hatchback, rechristened Tiagohis main concern was how to ensure the car would be profitable, according to the person who worked with both Mistry and Tata, and asked not to be identified as hes not authorized to speak to the media. Mistry talked to staff about what he, and even his children, thought of the marketing campaign and what needed fixing, the employee said.Ratan Tatas vision for the group was a globally diversified and successful conglomerate with some distinctive values, said Rishikesha T. Krishnan, director and professor of strategic management at the Indian Institute of Management Indore. Cyrus Mistry did not dismantle that vision, but he appears to have been particularly concerned about the viability of different businesses.If something went wrong, Tata would tell you to your face and then take immediate steps to rectify the problem, said a senior Tata Sons executive who has known Ratan Tata for more than two decades. He described Tata as a humanist with a deep sense of compassion, who was keen on products that fostered social justice like the Nano, or Tata Salt.In 2012, after grooming Mistry for the top job for a year, Tata stepped down as group chairman, and moved from his relatively modest apartment to a white, three-story house he built on the seafront near the exclusive Colaba neighbourhood of Mumbai, with a private gym and rooftop infinity pool looking out over the Arabian Sea, according to local newspaper reports.Start-up InvestingHe threw his energies into working with entrepreneurs, investing nominal sums in more than three dozen startups ranging from artificial intelligence to online sales of womens lingerie.Those who met him spoke of his imposing presence, graciousness and attention to detail in how ideas would work.Mr Tata. listens intently, has a curiosity to learn and often gives a fresh perspective that hasnt been considered, said Vani Kola, head of venture capital fund Kalaari Capital. He notices the smallest things, he puts people at ease.At the same time, he continued to keep any eye on the Tata Group as head of the powerful family trusts that hold a majority stake in Tata Sons. According to several people who know Tata, he became increasingly frustrated by what was happening to the company that bore his name.On 24 October, before the board meeting in Bombay House, where stray dogs are allowed to roam the corridors, Mistry was told of the decision to remove him.Cyrus Mistry was handpicked by Ratan Tata, said Goenka. This time he will look for someone who understands the Tata culture and the Tata way of doing things, better. Bloomberg",2016-11-08,ylJCy9morUM9QsY5DRkqhN,"Tata group, the dynastic business that built a reputation over more than a century for discretion, integrity and fair-dealing has sunk into a public spat of allegations and name-calling",11:24,Ratan Tatas return as interim chairman seen taking toll on Brand Tata 
-0.63,"When spot prices are lower than that of contracted long-term prices, it is natural for consumers to be reluctant to make long-term purchases. Thats what happened with Petronet LNG Ltd. Moreover, the anticipated revision of the RasGas, Qatar, contract led to further reduced offtake. 
				   
				For the December quarter, long-term volume was about 38 trillion British thermal units (trillion Btus), representing just two-fifths of the contracted volume. As a result of lower long-term volume, the firm had to bear ship idling charges worth about Rs.85 crore in the quarter.Sure, short-term volume and volume from services (tolling) increased, and compensated for the lack of long-term volume. Still, capacity utilization fell. Petronet LNGs Dahej Terminal has operated at around 109% of its nameplate capacity for the December quarter against 120% for the September quarter. The volume regasified at Dahej Terminal last quarter was 138 trillion Btus compared with 154 trillion Btus for the September quarter. The Kochi Terminal handled only a nominal volume of liquefied natural gas (LNG), according to the company.The outcome: Petronet LNG reported results sharply below expectations. Operating and net profits declined 32% and 28%, respectively, against the September quarter to Rs.316 crore and Rs.178 crore, respectively.But investors need not lose sleep over this. While the Petronet LNG stock has declined 7% from its annual high in January, it has substantially outperformed broader markets so far this fiscal year. The company has renegotiated the RasGas contract in December-end and that removes a key risk. The worst then could be behind us. Long-term volume is likely to recover in the current quarter. Outlook on spot volume too is not bad. Huge liquefaction capacities coming up in Australia and US will keep spot LNG prices subdued, resulting in higher demand for spot volume, point out analysts from Elara Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd.The Petronet LNG stock trades at 16 times next years earnings estimates, factoring in most of the positives. The firm maintains work for expansion of Dahej LNG Terminal from 10 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) to 15 mtpa is on track. The capacity expansion is likely to be completed by year end.
