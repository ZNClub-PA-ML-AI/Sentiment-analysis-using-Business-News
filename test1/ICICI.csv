0.58,"New Delhi: The central governments decision to demonetize Rs500 and Rs1000 notes will give a major push to e-wallets and the recently launched unified payment interface (UPI), an interoperable system launched by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), which will allow peer-to-peer and peer-to-entity payments. E-wallets like Paytm, Freecharge have been quick to capitalize on this and have been aggressively advertising to promote the usage of digital wallets as a way of moving towards a cashless economy.

				Home loans up to Rs75 lakh for women borrowers will now attract an interest of 9.15% from the earlier rate of 9.30%, according to the ICICI Bank website. At the same time, the new rate for salaried class has been reduced to 9.20%, as against 9.35% earlier. The new rate is effective from 2 November, a day after the bank lowered marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) by 0.1%.Yesterday, SBI had slashed interest rates by 0.15% for its home loans up to Rs75 lakh. SBI home loan is available at 9.15% while women borrowers will get it at 9.10% interest. According to analysts, the rate reduction effected by large players would put pressure on others to follow suit to remain in the competition. Since there is hardly any credit demand from corporate sector, most of the banks are chasing retail loans to keep their balance sheet ticking, analysts added.Yesterday, ICICI Bank launched a product for the salary account holders who have taken a loan from it, offering credit from Rs5 lakh to Rs1 crore against property owned by them.The product, ICICI Bank Home Overdraft, offers dual advantage of a term loan as well as an overdraft facility, the bank said in a statement.While the term loan provides customers with quick funds for immediate needs, the overdraft facility offers them the flexibility to access funds instantly for expenses, as and when required, the bank had said.Those buying the overdraft loan from the bank would be able to utilise the funds for their personal needs such as education, medical treatment, home renovation, marriage and overseas travel, among others.Customers will have the facility to avail a minimum 10% of the total amount as term loan and maximum 90% as overdraft.ICICI Bank said that the interest on term loan would be charged as per the equated monthly instalment, while on the overdraft the charges will be only on the utilised amount for the period the funds are used.",2016-11-03,05T7DNd3rw7HQKWVOFYoOP,"The new home loan rate is effective from 2 November, a day after ICICI Bank lowered marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) by 0.1%",15:43,ICICI Bank slashes home loan rate by 0.15%

				New installations of renewable energy overtook conventional power for the first time in 2015, the Paris-based agency said Tuesday in its Medium-Term Renewable Energy Market Report. Global green power rose by a record 153 gigawatts, equivalent to 55% of newly installed capacity last year. Total installed capacity exceeded coal for the first time, the IEA said.We are witnessing a transformation of global power markets led by renewables and, as is the case with other fields, the center of gravity for renewable growth is moving to emerging markets, IEA executive director Fatih Birol said.The report shows the acceleration toward clean-power generation was already picking up pace before governments agreed in Paris in December to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Renewables will be the worlds fastest-growing source of electricity over the next five years, according to the report.The IEA raised its estimate of the amount of green energy on power grids by 13%, revising its forecast to 42% by 2021. About 500,000 solar panels were installed each day across the globe in 2015, according to the report.Renewables capacity will be supported by falling costs, according to the agency. Solar panels are projected to be a quarter cheaper over the five year forecast period ending in 2021. Onshore wind-turbine prices may drop 15%.Much of the growth will be driven by four countries, the IEA said, identifying China, the US, India and Mexico as clean-energy hotspots over the next five years.

A senior Greenko executive said on condition of anonymity that the firm keeps exploring various options to optimize costs from time to time and overseas bonds is just one of them.Hyderabad-based Greenko, backed by Singapores GIC and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), acquired SunEdisons Indian assets in October at an enterprise value of $392 million (Rs2,607 crore). The deal involved an equity investment of $42 million (Rs279 crore) and required Greenko to assume project-level debt of $350 million at an average investment cost of 11.3%, according to recent corporate filings. Greenko has one of the largest renewable energy portfolios in India with 1GW of operating projects across hydro, wind and thermal power. It has actively tapped the overseas bond markets to fund its debt in recent years. In August, it raised $500 million from high-yield overseas green bonds to refinance a part of its exiting debt and meet operating and transaction costs. In recent months, several Indian firms have queued up to borrow at lower costs from overseas bond markets.

0.57,"At Mints 10th Annual Banking Conclave on 23 January, Indias top bankers got together to discuss issues confronting the sector such as competition, growth and asset quality. SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya, ICICI managing director (MD) and chief executive officer (CEO) Chanda Kochhar, Punjab National Bank MD and CEO Usha Ananthasubramanian, HDFC Bank MD Aditya Puri, Axis Bank MD and CEO Shikha Sharma, and Citibank India CEO Pramit Jhaveri took part in the discussion on Indian Banking: The new landscape moderated by Tamal Bandyopadhyay. Edited excerpts: 
On increasing competition and the changing banking landscape, with the emergence of differentiated banks:Puri: Competition will come, there will be a change in the financial landscape...congruence of information, technology, mobility, analytics and computing (means) that there will be a change in the business model. All of us are pretty much prepared today to offer every conceivable financial service to the customer in any form he wants. He wants it manually, he wants it on the phone, computerhe can have a complete set of services which include what wallets would do, what payment banks would do. If he comes to our bank say on our mobile phone, he can buy mutual funds, buy insurance, he can download an app like a wallet... he can get his assets report. We are pretty much ahead of the curve. We are not complacent.On foreign banks in India: Jhaveri: If you look back in time in the last 25 years, this industry has been no stranger to competition, this industry has been no stranger to disruption. In the last two decades, we have seen this happen multiple times; this industry is not afraid of competition... Since the financial crisis, the global industry has undergone significant changesome of it is because of the crisis, the new regulatory regime. As far as we are concerned there are natural advantages which we bring to the tablethere is a global footprint, global reach... If you combine that with our strength in India from the technology point of view, disruption point of view, we are very pleased with what we were able to do both on the corporate and consumer side. If you look at the number of milestones which have taken place... things have only got better over time. On the limited growth of foreign banks in India:Jhaveri: At the end of the day, you have to look at the presence you can have in a particular market place around the constraints we operate. At the end of the day, we have a limited branch footprint. When you look at innovations, plenty of which we have had on the consumer side, institution side, I will not bore you with that. You look at the market share (of foreign banks) with a very small physical footprint in the countrythe credit card business, wealth management business; I will not bore you with numbers. Our market share is significant...On the emerging competitive scenario:Ananthasubramanian: If you see Indian banking, every public sector bank remained a regional bank. Post-liberalization, with branch expansion, competition started. It will continue to be on, irrespective of the players coming in... Given the competition, I will say if you lay a cake on this table and everybody takes a piece, the cake will continue to grow. That is the scope of banking. But Indian banks have realized that you have to be on your toes and take competition through the route of technology. The established banks in the country can take on competition and still remain in harmony.Sharma: We will see new forms of competition coming. We have also invested a lot in terms of technology through a range of products to our customers and making sure we are able to differentiate in terms of service. We are pretty well prepared and any functionality customer is looking for, we have a digital footprint around that. We will not be embarrassed. We are excited by some of the competition. In India, today there is still a huge market out there...Jayakumar: Most significant challenge which we face is to complete the transformation exercise. One is to strengthen our basic processes, second is to get digital, analytical, etc., third is significant of people. That is a significant objective at this point of time. That said, we have a bunch of young people who are pushing forward, my perspective of the whole thing is get ourselves fit, get these changes done.Kochhar: I dont think many of us will be able to say different things because already a lot has been spoken. The Indian banking industry has always faced competition because we have certain areas of business that we are following; sometimes it is interest rates and currently technology is disruptive again. New entrants are coming in the field. A lot of changes are happening across...the financial spectrum. A lot of what these small entities can do, banks can also do; banks have a larger relationship with the customers. Second is, competition expands the market, it brings more and more people to the formal lending market.Bhattacharya: We have been alive for the past 111 years... We have in fact used competition at every level to sort of lift up, and in the last 10 years actually in deposits we have gained 300 basis points market share, from 15.3% we are up to 18.3% and in advances we have gained 60 basis points. We have a customer base of 350 million and on a daily basis we were opening 50,000-70,000 accounts...after demonetisation, we alone opened 89 lakh accounts, thats  the kind of the reach we have. Demonetisation gave us a boost in ensuring our BC (business correspondent) channels were really active, we have a huge amount of collaboration. We have 235,00 PoS (point of sales) machines which are paying out cash; competition makes us tougher, wiser and better.On how easy or difficult is it to change public sector banks:Jayakumar: One is to look at a parallel transformational exercise SBI has done. I have spoken to their CEOs, past and present. As far as changes are concerned, there will be some resistance; once plans start showing results, resistance starts coming off... I think it has lot to do with the way we communicate, but accept that there will be some pushback and you have to pick the right battles. On impact of demonetisation on monetary transmission:Bhattacharya: In Indian banks, 97% of resources come from deposits. Therefore, if you are not cutting rates of deposit, you will not be able to pass on that benefit (of lower rates). You cut rates of deposits when they are plentiful in the system. It is a simple law of demand and supply. All the banks are saying that if RBI (Reserve Bank of India) cuts rates and keeps liquidity tight, there is no way transmission can occur. Till March this year, liquidity was very very tight. However, because of the huge deposits that have come into the system, we are able to reduce the cost of deposits and automatically that will flow into cost of borrowing. A lot of us are held back, we are not sure how much of those resources will stay with us. If these resources prove to be stable, which we will get to know in the next 2-3 months, you will see deposit rates further falling... you will see impact on borrower side. On deposits, we are quite conservative; on loan side not so. The reason is that is we want to give a fillip to credit growth, with so much of deposits hanging on our hands if I dont give a fillip to credit growth I will not be able to make the best of the situation. On deposits side we are still being conservative.Puri: At the moment we have a tremendous amount of supply. If money is tight and we are not dependent on our borrowers funds, then unless the supply of money exceeds demand, rates will not come down... Sharma: For a quarter I will expect rates to remain low depending on when restrictions on withdrawls are removed. We will go quarter by quarter.Ananthasubramanian: This is a kind of one-off event that has happened in the countrys history. This kind of accretion we have never seen. Bank deposits have surged... Maybe, I am guessing, 40% will stay with us...For a short while, it will be an advantage that will flow to the customers.Kochhar: We should recognize this was a one of its kind event. Even in the first six months of the year, total accretion to the banking system was Rs5.4 trillion but just in these two months, accretion was another Rs6 trillion. In that sense liquidity has come into the banking system and therefore reduces the lending rate. Some part of it will go back to the system, and some should go back to the system. Impact on interest rates is (that) we will definitely remain in a soft interest rate regime.Ananthasubramanian: In the post-demonetisation era, what has happened is, specially women I speak of, that money has moved from masala dabbas to the banking sector. People have opened accounts, money has moved into the system, that is one. It is very important to educate (customers) and plan strategy with them, which is happening. People are being educated about various services like SIPs (systematic investment plans)...Jhaveri: When you look at credit offtake and investment, we tend to focus just on the private sector. When you look at different offtakes, we talked about consumers, households. I think there is no problem with credit offtake. As far as private corporate sector is concerned, working capital needs to increase, there are certain clear indications that working capital cycle is increasing. Hopefully, that will be followed over time as some will start increasing capacity utilization. It has been a tough period in terms of credit offtake...Kochhar: When you look at credit growth, lets also look at two things in terms of how the Indian economy is structurally changing. One is supply of credit itself, if you look at the last one year, there was a Rs4 trillion increase in the banking credit; there is an equal amount of issuance of bonds and commercial paperwe tend to ignore that. Second is that structure of economy is also changing...Its not just about working capital increase of a particular company, how it is translating into a lot of start-ups that are then increasing multiplier impact on the economy...Sharma: On retail side, as everybody has said, growth has been reasonably heavy, and some products are more interest rate-sensitivefor instance mortgages, very interest rate-sensitive. The fact that interest rates have come off, helps the mortgage market; may be right now people are waiting (in the hope) that home prices will correct next quarter or so; home loans should see annual growth from here, auto loans and retail loans have done well... We expect working capital growth to pick up. As far as private investment is concerned, we need to wait for the consumption cycle to play out. Credit growth of double digits is a good number. Bhattacharya: Investments happen when your existing capacity starts getting utilized to around 80-85%. Now for that to happen, demand has to go up. At this point of time, two things will make demand go up. Because demand in this country exists, its a question of people actually executing on that demand. One is business confidence goes up and two ease of doing business goes up. Both of these two are very important. Government has in its hands one very potent trigger that can actually be used for doing both the things, that is the budget. In the budget, it has been our recommendationboosting both consumption and investment. Now if this is done in proper manner I do believe it can act as a very good trigger. This along with resolution of large stressed assets on which we are working on very, very assiduously. These two things can actually bring back the demand.On pain caused to the informal economy by demonetisation, impact on demand:Puri: I think in most of the organized sector and sectors that moved from the unorganized to the organized sector, it (demand) has pretty much returned. I talked to Bharat Puri at Pidilite, he is seeing a return to whatever was there on 8 November; I talked to Harsh Mariwala (Marico Ltd chairman), he is also surprised with the V recovery; then I see for ourselves, we are back to 8 November.Sharma: I think what Aditya said is that in the formal sector or which has moved to the formal sector, recovery has surprised all by being V-shaped but the segments which are cash segment parts of agriculture, there I think the recovery is slower.Puri: The second part is that the parts of the economy that are moving from informal to formal sector also will create demand for assets. What you were financing previously though cash will now have to be financed with the banks.On banks asset quality. Is the worst over?Bhattacharya: One must understand somethingthat non-performing assets (NPAs) are not a one-time occurrence. NPAs are an occurrence that happen throughout the life of any institution, not only for banks, even for businesses. Even businesses have to write off some amount of receivables. What happened in this case was that a large number of units, especially in infrastructure, went bad because investments happened in one short and small space of time and many of the investments could not result in the ultimate assets getting created and cash flows getting established. This happened on account of many, many things that happened in the economy in a particular space of time. Having said that, I must say that whatever the government has done for enabling better resolution is going to have its effect, it may not have yet started...Yes, the worst is over...These are evolving times. Impact of demonetisation on SMEs (small and medium enterprises), that will come with a lag of about a quarter. It takes time to trickle down into the banks book. By March 2017, we should look at things getting better.Kochhar: When we talk of NPAs we generally just get stuck with recognition and numbers. Important point is recognition, resolution and provision. Now, if you look at banks in India, recognition-wise there are RBI rules, not just that. RBI followed earlier recognition through the AQR (asset quality review), we have also been doing that. As far as provisions are concerned, some banks have been proactive to actually provide more to the extent possible. On recognition and provisioning, a lot of work has happened.What is very important is that...we give equal amount of focus on resolution...Jayakumar: I am not focused on gross NPA ratio and that number for us has been coming down. Second, there are risks in the mid-market segment. Three, one hopes some of the larger accounts get resolved; that will provide us with some upgrades that will pay for the litigation. Overall I think we will be within the forecast that is provided.",2017-01-30,0Ab1voUw7w35LqJc80J1pL,"At Mints 10th Annual Banking Conclave, Indias top bankers discuss issues confronting the sector such as competition, growth and asset quality",02:58,Mint Annual Banking Conclave | The changing landscape of Indian banking
0.46,"The Indian banking system is quickly going digital, but in the rush to adopt technology and usher in a cashless society, is the system overlooking key opportunities and challenges? This was a topic of discussion at the 10th Mint Annual Banking Conclave, which was held in Mumbai on 23 January.
				   
				The panel discussing the issue included V. Vaidyanathan, founder and executive chairman, Capital First Ltd; Anup Purohit, chief information officer, Yes Bank Ltd; Naresh Makhijani, partner and head-financial services, KPMG; Vijay Mukhi, cybersecurity expert; and Venkatesh Hariharan, director (fintech), ISPIRT.According to Vaidyanathan, the Indian banking system is currently going through one of its toughest changes. With the current change coming in, a number of existing players could find themselves flat-footed and a number of new players such as payments banks, mobile wallet companies could be coming in. To innovate, this one is going to be a more difficult churn, he said.Purohit, the only banker on the panel, claimed Yes Bank had managed to improve digital payment options for its customers by taking the whole payments infrastructure outside the banks internal systems.We focused on API (application programming interface) banking where we said that our customers will not use Yes Bank systems. Our customers will directly use it on their own systems as we have implemented our API on their corporate ERP (enterprise resource planning), Purohit said.Hariharanwhose iSPIRT, a think tank that also produces digital solutions for the Indian banking sector to target customers with an annual income of Rs2-5 lakh said that a few large public sector banks have already started implementing  digital solutions to adapt to newer technologies and are trying to open up a large base of customers. He pointed out that working with banks had not been an easy ride. The problem, he said, was that the banks were unwilling to employ something new quickly and integrate it into their processes.For example, we have been talking about e-KYC (electronic know-your-customer) for years. The thing is that if you take paper-based KYC, the cost of acquiring a customer is about Rs1,000, but with e-KYC this cost is at about Rs60, which can further be brought down to Rs5, Hariharan said.The best way to move forward with digitization would be to embrace cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, said Mukhi. According to Mukhi, this would easily weed out any security concerns at banks and ensure that hackers do not get access to peoples money.We will solve our cybersecurity problem if we use cryptocurrencies in our banking systems, Mukhi said.Going ahead, banks would be looking at alliances with specialists to take digitization forward, predicted Makhijani of KPMG.It is difficult for a bank CIO to take a decision since there are so many types of technology available. It would largely depend on vagaries of their businesses and they may not want to do everything alone, Makhijani said.A challenge that the banking system faced was that with so many developments happening in the financial technology space, many of the innovations might be getting bypassed, said Vaidyanathan. Focusing on certain things such as scanning of multiple documents through fiber optic technology might not even be necessary, since most application and complaint processes had now been automated.Vaidyanathan also urged bankers to make more efforts to popularise the unified payments interface (UPI).The panel also discussed the banking sectors handling of demonetisation, where large queues were seen outside branches for many days. According to the panellists, while banks handled the situation well, issues were also caused due to the mindset of the average customer who doesnt fully trust digital payment options.",2017-01-30,0S81b1kQmceoP1OAaligcK,"At the 10th Mint Annual Banking Conclave, bankers discuss whether the Indian banking system is missing key opportunities in its rush to adopt technology",03:07,Is the banking system overlooking key challenges in its rush to go digital?

They are talking to some of the existing investors of the company, too, to pick the stake from them, said one of the two people cited above, requesting anonymity, as the talks are private.According to the second person cited above, the bank is looking to sell its stake at a price that would value Mswipe at $200-250 million.Around the last time they raised funds, the company was valued at close to $150 million. The price which they are seeking could get them up to $20 million for their stake, he said.The last fund-raising at Mswipe was in July 2015, when the company raised Rs160 crore in a Series C round from new investors such as Falcon Edge Capital, Ola Cabs and Meru Capital.Existing investors Matrix Partners India, Axis Bank Ltd and DSG Consumer Partners also participated in the funding round.Axis Bank first invested in the company in early 2013.Emails sent to Axis Bank and Mswipe on Friday went unanswered.Mswipe was founded in 2012 by Manish Patel, a doctor by education, who previously co-founded an alcoholic beverages distribution company called Milestone Merchandise. Mswipe provides a mobile payment solution with a card reader, which can be attached to any mobile phones audio (headset) jack. The company also provides similar card payment solutions for smartphones.It works closely with smaller banks such as Corporation Bank, RBL Bank Ltd, Shamrao Vithal Co-op. Bank and large banks such as Axis Bank.It is also present in the Middle East, the US and South-East Asia through partnerships. Its clients include small and medium enterprises.In the payments services market, Mswipe competes with companies such as Ezetap and Paynear.In August 2015, Ezetap raised Rs150 crore from Social+Capital, Helion Advisors and Berggruen Holdings, Horizons Ventures and the Capricorn Investment Group.In December 2015, Paynear raised around Rs16 crore from a high net-worth individual investor.According to a March 2015 report by Ken Research, the payment services industry grew at a compound annual growth rate of 147.6% between the financial years 2012 and 2014.The research firm believes that the Indian payments market will continue to grow at a strong rate going ahead. The payments market is driven largely by transactions through mobile point of sale terminals and mobile banking, the report said.For Axis Bank, plans to sell its stake in Mswipe come at a time when the bank is facing stress due to loans that soured.In the quarter to September, the private sector bank reported a 83% plunge in net profit at Rs319 crore, primarily on account of higher provisioning for bad loans.The bank had posted a net profit of Rs1,915.64 crore in the same period in 2015-16.Gross non-performing assets (NPA) and net NPAs at the bank rose to 4.17% and 2.02%, respectively in the quarter.",2016-11-15,0SArJpfqkiCBj82GYYIncL,Axis Bank may sell its 8% stake in mobile payments firm Mswipe for around $20 million in a deal that is likely to value that firm at $200-250 million,00:47,Axis Bank in talks to sell Mswipe stake
-0.11,"New Delhi: The finance ministrys financial intelligence unit (FIU) has asked the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to examine all foreign investments made in the medical devices sector under the automatic route after January 2015, when the foreign direct investment (FDI) policy for the sector was laid out.
				   
				A procedural oversight in the FDI policy governing investments in the sector as well as the definition of medical devices, has prompted the move.According to the policy, 100% foreign investment was allowed through the automatic route for manufacturing medical devices in both greenfield and brownfield sectors. However, the definition of medical devices in the policy is based on what was proposed in the Drugs and Cosmetics (Amendment) Bill, 2013, which was withdrawn from Parliament in June 2016.Interestingly, the need for a separate legislation for the medical devices sector was one of the reasons for the withdrawal of the draft legislation since there is no clear definition governing medical devices in the existing Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940.There may be larger issues involved since the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 (amendment bill) has been withdrawn and the proposed definition of medical devices is not effected in law, FIU said in a note to RBI and the department of pharmaceuticals on 20 October. Mint has reviewed a copy of the note.As it is different from the definition given under the extant Drug and Cosmetics Act, 1940, there may be instances on mis-representation, which may lead to companies availing automatic route... though they may not be strictly entitled to, given the scope of their activity, as is in the present case, FIU said in the note. FIUs comment was in connection with the proposed investment made by French biotechnology firm BioMérieux in Indias RAS Lifesciences, in which the former owned 60% and had proposed to raise its stake to 70%.A person aware of the matter said BioMérieuxs investments in RAS may not be approved under the automatic route.BioMérieux and RAS Lifesciences did not respond to detailed questionnaires sent by Mint.The French multinational has asserted that it does not need approval from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) as the 10% investment in RAS Lifesciences was made after the government withdrew the requirement for an FIPB nod in the medical devices sector in January 2015.RBI appeared to agree with the firms stance in a communication dated 2 August.Earlier rules for FDI in the medical devices sector had three caveatsa non-compete clause except with the approval of FIPB,  the requirement of a certificate along with the FIPB application by the investor and investee, and the right to incorporate appropriate conditions for FDI in brownfield investments. These three conditions were also rescinded when the FDI policy for medical devices was introduced in January 2015.While the assertion of the company is correct and it does not make sense in linking medical devices and pharmaceuticals sector, the regulation has been so worded that the definition of medical devices as given in the FDI policy/FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act) regulations would be applicable subject to amendment of Drugs and Cosmetics Act. We understand the Act is still to be amended. In such an event, FIPB approval would be required, RBI said in a letter to FIPB.However, we are of the view that since medical devices has been defined in the FDI policy and in the regulations, this particular condition may be deleted, so that in future FIPB approval may not be required for such cases irrespective of whether the Drugs and Cosmetics Act has been amended or not, it said.Mails sent to RBI and the finance ministry did not elicit a response.The implication of the anomaly is twofoldone, for any foreign investment made in the sector (post the FDI policy) to qualify under automatic route, the companys activity should be confined solely to manufacturing of medical devices and not pharmaceuticals or brownfield pharma.Two, as the proposed definition under FDI policy is different from the one in force, and defined, by law, there may be instances of firms availing the automatic route, which they may not be entitled to, owing to misinterpretation of the rules  deliberate or otherwise.FIU has also advised the department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP) to examine afresh the policy of foreign investment in medical devices, in consultation with the department of pharmaceuticals (DoP).DIPP may also issue a corrigendum to the FDI policy of January 2015 so that the definition of medical devices as given in the extant Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, is applied for availing benefit under FDI policy for medical devices, FIU said.",2016-11-15,0WvjNUVdKA0wsRBs0dv1FK,"Finance ministrys FIU has asked RBI to examine all foreign investments under the automatic route after January 2015, when FDI policy for the sector was laid out",01:39,Govt tells RBI to examine foreign investments in medical devices sector 
0.22,"Ford Motor Co. on Tuesday said that it will invest $195 million (Rs1,300 crore) in Chennai to build a global technology and business centre that will serve as a hub for product development, mobility solutions and business services for India and other markets around the world. 
				   
				The centre will also house the companys largest information technology organization outside of the companys global headquarters. Mint had in October 2015 first reported about Fords plans to set up a global technology and business centre in India.India is not only a vibrant market for cars and new mobility ideas, it also is rich with talent, technical expertise and ingenuity, executive chairman Bill Ford said in a statement. This new center will help us attract the best and brightest, and make Chennai a true hub of innovation for Ford around the world. Once it gets completed in 2019, the centre will become Fords third global product development centre in Asia Pacific and part of Fords global product development network.It also will feature a wide range of laboratories and testing facilities for both full vehicles and components, enabling Ford to conduct extensive testing of future vehicles in India, the company said in a statement. However, Tuesdays announcement is unlikely to help Fords India operations immediately and the focus will be more on feeding into the Detroit-based companys global operations.Ford in India continues to struggle even after being present in the country for more than 20 years, in which the Indian market has changed drastically.In the six years between 2010-11 and 2015-16, the American car makers annual sales in India have grown only twice. Sales reached the highest at 98,537 units in 2010-11 because of the success of the Figo but they declined to 92,665 units and 77,225 units in 2011-12 and 2012-13, respectively. Sales grew in 2013-14 and fell in 2014-15 only to rise again in 2015-16, albeit on a smaller base. During the same period, the Indian passenger vehicle market expanded from 2.52 million units to 2.78 million.In recent times, the companys second generation Figo failed to receive the kind of response that the previous one did. Ford did create a new compact SUV segment with the EcoSport, but it failed to capitalize on the first-mover advantage. The segment is now dominated by market leader Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Hyundai Motor India Ltd. Ford, along with Volkswagen India Pvt. Ltd, was the last one to enter the sub-four-metre sedan category but demand in the segment has waned, which meant lukewarm response for the American car makers Figo Aspire.In pursuit of making its business sustainable, the company has changed tack and shifted focus to exports, which grew 41.37% to 55,821 units between April and September.Indias overall car exports grew 3.89% to 319,579 units.In the new centre in Chennai, the company will hire 3,000 skilled workers over the next five years. Ford also will consolidate 9,000 employees from six existing facilities in Chennai on the 28-acre campus, the company said in a statement.Ford has invested over $2 billion in India to set up two plants, one each in Chennai and Sanand in Gujarat.

0.25,"Ahmedabad: Billionaire Gautam Adani, chairman of the Adani Group, talks about the companys $16 billion coal project in Australia in an interview after winning a series of court battles that once threatened to derail the controversial mining project.
ALSO READ | Gautam Adani says debt level not a concern, eyes new sectorsThe Gujarat-based businessman also discusses his plans for solar, the next sunrise sectors for the group, the changing Indian economic scenario, compensatory tariff issues for its thermal power plants and the Adani Sagar Mala, a string of ports across the country. Edited excerpts:After much delay, your plans to build one of the worlds largest coal mines in Australia seems back on track with the recent court rulings being in your favour and the Australian government extending full support to the project. How do you see your Australian dreams unfolding? Also, you have faced similar resistance from environmental groups in India too in the past. What do you find in common in the two?After four long years of approval processes and unnecessary  struggles in courts, we have finally overcome the hurdles and we hope to take it to our board (Adani Enterprises) for final investment decisions by March. The Carmichael mine, rail and port project includes the development of a world-class mine with phase one production of 25 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) in FY21. This includes 388-km standard gauge multi-user railway line of 60 mtpa capacity and related port expansions. The coal from this mine would be used to fire our power projects in Mundra and Udupi.The recent successful meeting with Australian federal, state and regional leaders not only enhanced our confidence but also has paved the way for enhancing trade multi-fold between the two nations.The much-needed infrastructure for the project will open up the Galilee Basin and put Australia in a competitive position in a global sea-borne market. The total life of mine capex is about $16 billion and we would have invested about $4.5 billion in the first phase.Now, coming to the other part, I will tell you that we remain fully committed and very confident of the environmental impact studies we commission and all this information is public. Be it India or Australia or any other country, the impact studies we do are world-class and we use consultants of global repute to augment our very strong internal team.There have been several positive recent court outcomes in Australia that rejected the claims of what are largely activist-inspired appeals and uphold the strong approvals process by the governments in Australia that we have complied with. These activist-motivated appeals are at odds with the strong local community support in the regions the projects are based. So, the court wins provide more confidence around the project time-frames for Adani and meeting demand in India as well as for the supporting communities in Australia.Just like any other company in our sector, there will always be some resistance for different reasons and its a part of our business to be able to address these in a transparent and scientific manner.There are both differences and similarities between activist activities in the two nations. Increasingly these are political campaigns with wider objectives and often with funding and support by global NGOs. Regrettably, these campaigns often dont recognize that in many respects, India and Adani are at the forefront of finding the right balance between our leadership on renewable energy and the fact that our developing economy also needs the affordable thermal energy that many other nations still rely on for their base load.We continue to look for opportunities in mining sector across the globe as we aspire to be world leaders in the integrated pit-to-plug strategy in our energy vertical. It includes mines, rail and port developments.You seem to have got a clear ambition to be a dominant player in the sectors that you venture into, be it ports, power, mining or the more recently forayed renewable energy business. What is the next sunrise sector for you?It is important to understand that for a growth economy like India, even our core sectors of ports, power (including solar) and mining remain sunrise sectors, given the sheer potential ahead. All you need to do is to look at China and see what they have done over the past 25 years to be able to realize that the real period of growth for India within our core sectors is still ahead of us. A 7+% GDP (gross domestic product) growth rate and the strong policy advocacy that we are seeing from the government will provide the additional tail wind for companies like us to keep growing our business at healthy double-digit rates.That being said, we are certainly evaluating other sectors that include coal conversions, defence and water. However, its too early to say which of these would be the next sunrise sector for us.Solar seems to have taken a top priority for the group in recent times. You have also set up the worlds largest solar plant in Tamil Nadu.Solar indeed has taken a significant priority and is a great example of how rapidly we capitalize on opportunities. Over the past 18 months, we have built a confirmed pipeline of 2,000MW of solar power, commissioned the worlds largest solar plant in Tamil Nadu in a record period of nine months.We have a target of contributing 10% of capacity in the national target under Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) of 100,000MW of grid-connected solar power by 2022. Accordingly, we aim to set up 10,000MW of solar power plants and at least 10,000MW of solar parks during this period. One has to remember that ultimately, the speed of learning cycles and the execution experience makes all the difference and at this time, we are doing this perhaps faster than any other player in the world. In Australia too, we have focused plans to enter the renewable energy sector.You have announced $1 billion for a solar panels and solar cells production facility. What kind of opportunity do you see in solar manufacturing for an Indian company?We are in the process of commissioning a 1.2GW, Indias largest integrated solar manufacturing facility, to produce polysilicon, ingots, wafers, cells and modules and ancillary products under Make in India initiative at Mundra (Gujarat) in multiple phases.One has to understand that under the JNNSM programme, we are talking about establishing a 100GW solar generation capacity by 2022. No country in the world has ever accelerated their solar programmes at the pace this government has set out to do. India is set to become one of the leaders in the world in renewable energy generation in the days to come. Indian solar power market is expected to grow at CAGR of more than 60% for next five to 10 years. With solar tariffs coming in grid parity with that of thermal power and going forward is expected to come down further, future energy demand will be met from the solar projects.Currently, Indian solar manufacturing is inefficient compared to some international markets due to many reasons like obsolete and inflexible units of existing manufacturers, lack of economy of scale, dependence on imported raw material, etc. Large scale, end to end, vertically integrated solar manufacturing facility like that at Mundra will have a significant edge over currently established cell and module manufacturing units in India and can easily compete with worlds leading producers. Yes, there will be competition, but one has to recognize that we must have the confidence that the only way we can be a major player in the solar area is to be able to compete across the solar value chain using global benchmarks and therefore we need to use our integrated strategy as a differentiator.There were reports about your talks to take over some assets of Sun Edison in India. What is the current status? We evaluate various business opportunities continuously. Lot of projects in India, which were aggressively bid out, are in market looking for buyers/investors. Some of these were just taken to be later sold to potential buyers before or soon after the development. We looked at some of the assets but then decided that it made more sense to organically develop the businessat least as of now. As regards Sun Edison, we heard from media reports that Greenko is in advanced stage of discussions.Moving from solar, tell us what is happening in thermal power projects. The fluctuating coal prices and compensation tariff have been a concern for the company for quite some time now.From the very beginning, our goal has been to generate 20,000MW by 2020. Indian power sector has witnessed rapid advancement over the past few years with installed capacity surpassing 300GW and electricity demand reaching 1,100 billion units. Indias current per capita power consumption is over 1,000kWh (kilowatt hour) per capita per annum and aspires to reach 2,000kWh per capita per annum by 2024. With current power-generation capacity of around 11,000MW, Adani Power is already the largest private power producer in India. We have always ensured fast-paced execution of projects and implemented the best available technologies and practices that can serve as benchmarks for the power industry.The company has already got relief from Appellate Tribunal for Electricity, which held in its judgment that changes in Indonesian regulations affecting discounted coal prices under contract is a force majeure event under the PPAs (power-purchase agreements) and asked the central regulator to grant appropriate relief. The matter has been sub judice from last four years and therefore, though coal price is falling, the company has been under severe financial stress due to delay in grant of appropriate relief. Despite a long legal battle, we are honouring our commitments to supply power. Similarly, grant of relief is also pending for the tariff of power supply from Kawai (Rajasthan) and Tiroda (Maharashtra) power plants.Are you looking for further expansions or acquisitions in the power sector?Yes, we are looking to continue our expansion and I expect some of it will be inorganic. The Indian power sector is witnessing consolidation among the private sector developers. We are looking at all opportunities, brownfield and greenfield projects. A lot of the power projects up for acquisition come with multiple challenges such as transmission evacuation, rail connectivity, no PPA, no domestic coal supply and many more.How have things changed in the power sector under the new leadership at the centre?The proof of success lies in metrics and I think the numbers speak for themselves. I have already spoken about how solar power has been catalysed by the policy initiatives taken by the government. Average solar tariffs are now at Rs4 per unit and this is a tremendous achievement by any yardstick or measure and the long-term cascading benefits of this in helping industries, getting power to rural areas as well as galvanizing the solar value chain in India will be significant.From providing a lifeline to the ailing state-owned power distribution utilities (discoms) in the form of UDAY (Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana) scheme, introducing amendments in the National Tariff Policy, ramping up the countrys traditionally neglected transmission network and boosting domestic coal supply, many initiatives have been introduced by the centre to facilitate sustainable growth in the power sector.In our view, the centre has set the reform process in motion, which has already made a difference, but the full impact will be felt only in the long run.For the groups most successful business, ports, has there been any change in strategy for attaining your previously articulated goal of reaching 200 mtpa by 2020? Also, you have built a huge network of ports across the country, making acquisitions in the east and south. What is the overall strategy?With a strategy to serve large Indian hinterland, APSEZ (Adani Ports and SEZ Ltd) has developed and operates 10 ports/terminals across the coastline of India. All our ports and terminals are strategically located, making a string of ports or the Adani Sagar Mala. This network of multi-cargo ports enables us to cater to major consumption and resource-rich regions of India. The addition of the Kattupalli port (in Tamil Nadu) earlier this year to augment our flanking strategy along with its sister Ennore port in Chennai has been yet another success with volumes at the Kattupalli port already doubling since we have taken over operations. Kattupalli has a tremendous location and we plan to convert it to a multi-cargo port to further capitalize on this advantage. In Kerala, our plan to build out the Vizhinjam transhipment port at the southern-most tip of India is on track and this will be yet another strategic port that will draw traffic from the worlds busiest shipping routes as well as allow our own countrys traffic to be transhipped within our country.In FY16, we handled a cargo volume of 151 MMT and we are expecting 10-15% cargo growth in FY17. While we are seeing growth in cargo handling at our existing ports, we are also expanding our presence across the Indian coastline. Given the growth rates, we have seen in the ports sector and the progress made over the last few years we will reach our target of 200 mtpa well before 2020, most likely well before the end of 2018.We are also targeting to provide value-added services to our customers in form of integrated logistics solutions, which is going to enhance growth prospects of our ports. Having presence across the coastline of India is going to be a key factor in this initiative. Our logistics business has seen record growth over the past three years and is well set to capitalize on the logistics boom as we expand our network of warehouses, ICDs and transportation capabilities. Ultimately, as part of our strategy, we want to be a one-stop shop for many of our major customers.Currently, we are focusing on timely completion of our LNG and LPG terminals at Mundra and Dhamra, coastal shipping, container trans-shipment and improvement in operational efficiency by leveraging technology. We are confident that all these initiatives together will help us in reaching our goal. Mundra is today the largest commercial port of the country, handling over 110 mtpa. How do you continue to keep this momentum going given some stiff competition given by government-controlled major ports especially Kandla Port, your closest competitor in terms of traffic and commercial cargo volumes handled?Mundra is our flagship port and a true success story, which has given new goals to the port sector in India. We are expanding capacity at Mundra port and container terminal 4 would be operational soon.Mundra enjoys superior operational efficiencies owing to its investment in evolving commodity-specific infrastructure such as fully mechanized coal import terminal, fertilizer cargo complex and mechanized steel yard, among others. These facilities ensure best service levels at Mundra port. These coupled with our long-term relationships with stakeholders such as shipping lines and key customers are key factors in maintaining long-term competitiveness in the region and the country. More than 65% of our cargo being handled under long-term service contracts with various customers across various cargo types. These advantages continue to help Mundra port grow, which registered a 12% y-o-y growth in 2016-17.In fact, spurt in cargo handling at Tuna Tekra is one of the significant reasons behind the recent cargo growth visible at Kandla port. (Tuna Tekra is a terminal operated by APSEZ and falls under the purview of Kandla Port Trust.)The upcoming LNG and LPG terminals at Mundra port are going to further strengthen the niche position of the port in the market. Having SEZ, DTA and FTWZ create right ecosystem for the port to offer a long-term advantage to our customers. Furthermore, we continue to focus on efficiency improvement through several operational and technological initiatives to increase value-edge. As highlighted, our integrated logistics service offering is going to add further value to our customers, enhancing their convenience and ease of handling logistics through Mundra port and our other ports in India.How do you see your acquisitions in ports? How do you see them fit in your overall growth plans?Our strategy remains on track as we have built out a network of 10 ports all the way from Mundra (in Gujarat) in the west to Dhamra (in Odisha) in the east. The acquisition of the Dhamra port in 2013 has been a huge success from the operational and strategic perspective and we turned around the performance in the very first year. Given the focus on coastal shipping, we should see a further step change in the performance of Dhamra. The port has increased significantly from handling around 10 mtpa cargo to a port targeting to handle around 21 mtpa cargo in 2016-17. It is being envisioned to replicate success of Mundra port for the east coast. We plan to undertake major capacity enhancements at Dhamra port, taking its current capacity from 20 mtpa to 100 mtpa in future.You have also ventured into defence, where you have floated a separate entity. What is happening there?We are in various discussions to enable the Make in India programme, but its too early for me to make any comment.Some time ago, Adani Group got the environmental nod for setting up a shipbuilding yard in Kutch. Can you elaborate on your plans and also if you plan to build ships for the defence sector.Its too early to elaborate on any of these plans. However, there is no plan for us to build ships for the defence sector.What about your plans to enter the financial services sector? There were reports of Adani planning to acquire Macquarie NBFC.This has been done in a private domain by the promoters.There has been quite a buzz about Adani being a debt-heavy company. What is your take on this? As you are aware, infra is a capital-intensive business. At group level, our long-term debt: Ebitda is at a comfortable level of 3.25:1. The corresponding value of net fixed asset is Rs125,000 crore. Overall, for infra business, we are robustly placed.The social sector is being given more focus in the past couple of years with new CSR guidelines in place. What areas is Adani focusing on? The areas that the Adani Foundation focuses on are education, community health, sustainable livelihood and rural infrastructure. Adani Foundations education programmes have already touched the lives of over 150,000 young students, the healthcare programmes touches the lives of over 200,000 people every year, the sustainable livelihood programs have made over 35,000 people and their entire families self-reliant and the rural infrastructure programmes have improved the lives of over 500,000 people across 177 villages by helping provide better roads, drinking water and other basic facilities.What about ventures like real estate, promoted by the family?Adani Realty, our youngest venture, is vigorously expanding its offering of high-quality residential, commercial, affordable and township projects in Mumbai, Gurgaon and Ahmedabad. Our execution is always on track with improving focus on satisfying customer needs and trust. Shantigram is probably one of Indias finest mixed-use townships already. Despite the temporary downturn in the realty sector, you will hear more about Adani Realty and its ambitious growth plans ahead.How do you see the overall Indian economy for industries today under the government at the centre? A lot has been written about your proximity to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. How do you view this?Ultimately, we should let the metrics speak for themselves. India continues to remain the bright spot in the otherwise slowing global economy. It has been and will also be in 2016-17 the fastest-growing major economy, growing at 7.5% as against a global economy that is projected to grow at 3.5%. Today, there is increasing recognition that a large part of the growth is a result of the policies that the government has moved to quickly introduce reforms after coming to power. FDI (foreign direct investment) is a sign of global confidence and FDI over the past 24 months in India has grown 46% and stands at $62 billion, which is an all-time record. In my opinion, we are just getting started and the actual benefits will be realized by the industries over the next decade.The next generation of Adani Group seems to be gearing up for the future. Your elder son Karan Adani was earlier this year appointed as new CEO of APSEZ. How do you see him taking bigger responsibilities?Karan has now been involved in the ports business for over seven years now and I am proud of the way he has developed himself with the strategic and operational role he has played over the years. He has built a well-rounded leadership team who can capitalize on the opportunities in the sector. I am confident that the next phase of expansion that we will see under his leadership will help APSEZ further strengthen its position as a port and port-led development company.",2016-12-19,0v3GPxrwuJA6gebfOMy7iN,"Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani on the Australian coal mine project, plans for the solar power sector and Adani ports along Indias coastline",02:36,We aspire to be world leaders with our integrated pit-to-plug strategy: Adani

				Revenue rose 20% on a 25% growth in volume.In the previous eight quarters, revenue and volume had increased in the range of 2-19%. Strong growth in Latin America helped the company report a robust performance.Late sowing of corn in the region led to sales spill-over from the December quarter. Also, UPLs products for rice, fruits and vegetables performed well in Mexico and Columbia.As a result, operating profit jumped 25%. Margins expanded 90 basis points to 22.6%. According to Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd, this is the companys best ever quarterly margin. The company ended 2015-16 with a revenue growth of 10%. The growth is slower than the 12-17% increase the company saw in the last two fiscals. But the performance should be seen in the context of the demand and currency headwinds that the industry is facing.The global crop protection market is estimated to have contracted 10% in 2015. Brazil, one of the key markets for agrochemical firms, declined 23%. Despite this, UPL has grown revenue, thanks to market share gains.According to Sharekhan Ltd, the management maintained its guidance of 12-15% revenue growth and 60-100 basis points margin expansion in the current fiscal. The growth is expected to be driven by new product launches and market share gains, especially in Latin America.The robust performance and guidance have led to an earnings upgrade. HDFC Securities Ltd and Emkay raised their sales, operating profit estimates for the current fiscal. But Emkay downgraded the stock citing run-up in the share priceits up 15% in the last fiscal. While the gains are not spectacular, weighing on sentiment is the companys renewed focus on capital expenditure. According to Emkay, the company is likely to incur a capex of Rs.800-900 crore per annum for the next couple of years to expand and upgrade capacities. A growing firm like UPL cannot avoid investments. But the fear is that aggressive capex can limit free cash flows and delay the balance sheet improvement measures. Also, it brings back earlier memories of UPL pursuing inorganic growth, which undermined key financial ratios and stock valuations.

0.47,"Mumbai: Railways has made its unreserved ticketing system (UTS) mobile ticketing application more passenger-friendly by adding two features on the Android-based platform. The centre for railway information systems (CRIS), the IT arm of railways, has added two important features on the Android-run application to make payments and printing of tickets easier for passengers, an official said on Thursday.
				   
				 Firstly, its wallet could now be recharged with private on-line payment players like Paytm and MobiKwik, an option which was not available earlier. Till now, customers had to recharge the wallet through net banking, said Narendra Patil, chief PRO of Central Railway (CR). Secondly, passengers can get a printed unreserved ticket through the application.

0.38,"Mindtree Ltds shares have behaved strangely in the past two trading sessions. The company issued a profit warning at the beginning of the week, and it initially seemed that investors more or less shrugged it off, as the shares corrected by only 2.7% on Tuesday. But the next day, after the shares adjusted for a 1:1 bonus issue, Mindtrees valuation fell by as much as 11.5%.
				   
				Some of this is due to the so-called bonus stripping that some high networth individuals engage in, which partly makes it a technical correction. But the companys valuations have also been unusually high for a long time, and so the correction is welcome.Mindtrees statement to investors earlier in the week said that organic revenues will grow only marginally in the March quarter, owing to delays in project starts in the retail and banking, and financial services segments. Based on the companys comments at the time of the December quarter results announcement, the expectation was that growth will be better than the 2.3% it reported for the third quarter. Similarly, while the earlier expectation was that margins will grow, Mindtree has now said that margins will decline.The warning has led to some cuts in earnings estimatesalthough the 14% fall in the companys shares looks a bit overdone. Note that this came after a 5% outperformance vis-à-vis the Nifty IT index in the preceding three trading sessions, which, again, was on account of the bonus stripping opportunity.Bonus stripping involves buying shares just before the ex-date of the bonus issue, and then selling half of the holding at the adjusted ex-bonus share price. In Mindtrees case, it would have involved, for instance, a purchase at Tuesdays price of around Rs.1,550 as the first leg of the transaction. The second leg would involve selling half the number of shares acquired at Tuesdays average price of around Rs.700. The resulting loss of Rs.850 per share can be used to offset short-term capital gains from other transactions. As far as the unsold portion of the portfolio goes, it is typically held for a year to avoid capital gains tax; or in some cases is sold if prices drop beyond a threshold.Perhaps, a large number of such transactions put pressure on Mindtrees shares on Wednesday. Even so, as pointed out earlier, the company enjoyed relatively high valuations, and the correction is welcome. Analysts at Religare Institutional Research said in a note to clients on 8 March, Mindtree is trading at a premium to the sector and to large-caps. While better growth and execution deserve a premium, we think (a valuation of) 17x serves more of an exit multiple for investors in a sector undergoing ROE (return on equity) compression.Besides, after the companys profit warning, expectations on growth would have to be toned down a bit as well.",2016-03-10,1NzTKdPgwV9gWnT6L6vqJN,"The companys valuations have also been unusually high for a long time, and so the correction is welcome

0.03,"Beijing: Its goodbye China, hello virtual reality (VR) for Hugo Barra. After spending three and half years in Beijing leading smartphone-maker Xiaomi Corp.s global division, Barra is returning to Silicon Valley to head Facebooks VR efforts. 
				   
				He leaves behind an uneven legacy.Barra, 40, was hired in 2013 from Google, where he worked as head of product management for Android, to oversee Xiaomis international expansion. While he helped boost device sales in India, the company aborted a push into Brazil and its other global efforts have largely stalled. At the same time, Xiaomi lost ground in its home market to domestic competitors like Vivo and Oppo, which worked more effectively with retail stores. Barra arrived with an ambitious vision, but failed to predict and overcome rapid changes in the global smartphone market.He did a lot to build up Xiaomis mindshare internationally, said Bryan Ma, vice president for devices research at IDC in Singapore. But when you look at the hard numbers, they show mixed results.Barras surprise exit comes just a couple of weeks after co-founder and CEO Lei Jun said in a letter to employees that the company had recently faced unforgettable challenges and now needed to focus on sustainable growth. After building its success by selling only online, its now developing brick-and-mortar stores in China. Barra declined to comment for this story, but he cited several accomplishments in social media posts as he departed, including the expansion into India and more than 20 other markets. A spokesperson for Xiaomi said Thursday he would continue to advise the company for the indefinite future.When he first moved from sunny California to smoggy Beijing, Barra brought the world spotlight with him. Energetic, globe-trotting, and supremely comfortable commanding a conference-hall stage, the Brazilian-born Barra showed Xiaomi how to introduce its expanding line of products -- which include fitness bands, ear buds, and air filters -- into other countries with a fast-growing middle class.He helped to be that ambassador to the rest of the world, said IDCs Ma. He was that enthusiastic, charismatic guy on stage, who helped explain who this Chinese company was.From 2012 to 2015, Xiaomis smartphone sales rose at a furious clip, expanding more than six-fold, powered by online flash sales and savvy social-media. For parts of 2014 and 2015, Xiaomi ranked first in domestic smartphone sales, and local and international media dubbed the company the Apple of China. When Barra joined, he hoped to translate that success abroad, identifying India and Brazil as key targets. The vision was promising enough that in late 2014, Xiaomi was valued at about $45 billion, the highest for any startup in the world at the time.Yet Xiaomis position at home soon began slipping. Facing intense competition from Vivo, Oppo and other rivals, Xiaomi dropped from first to fourth among smartphone sellers in China. While it focused on online sales, its competitors worked to become more prominent in retail stores, where the vast majority of customers still buy phones. The challenges at home foreshadowed hurdles in other markets.To replicate an e-commerce model from China in India or Indonesia is not as easy as it sounds. Every country has a different internet culture, said Edward Tse, a Hong Kong-based business consultant and author of the book Chinas Disruptors, which described the early days of Xiaomi and other Chinese tech upstarts.By traveling frequently to India -- and chronicling his trips on social media -- Barra helped to build a smartphone business there with $1 billion in annual revenue, an achievement he noted in his farewell Facebook post. Xiaomi is currently ranked third in the Indian smartphone market, with 9 percent market share, according to Counterpoint Research.Hugo spearheaded the idea of how you bring Xiaomi-branded products outside of China, said Gary Rieschel, founding managing partner at Qiming Venture Partners, an early investor in Xiaomi. He works incredibly hard.Barra thanked Lei Jun and Xiaomis fans in his departure post on Facebook. This journey has been nothing short of spectacular in every way, he wrote, and I can proudly say that Xiaomi Global is the first baby I helped bring into the world.Neil Shah, Counterpoints research director in India, thinks Xiaomis performance in India may be near peaking. Theres almost a ceiling about how much you can sell online. Sixty to seventy percent of the markets are offline, he said. For online channels, Xiaomis margins are razor thin, in India and China alike. Chinese rival Vivo, which works closely with retail stores, has already overtaken Xiaomi in India.IDCs Ma says Xiaomis prospects in India look positive for the next year, but after that he isnt so sure. The story in India reflects a lot of what has been happening in China, too. As the market shifts toward offline channels, it favors Oppo and Vivo.According to IDC, India is now Xiaomis dominant overseas market -- accounting for 62 percent of its non-China shipments for the first nine months of 2016. Next up is Myanmar, accounting for 16 percent of shipments. Myanmar is not exactly the first country that comes to mind when you think of the global smartphone market, said Ma.After opening with much fanfare in the summer of 2015, Xiaomis Brazil office closed last year. The companys position in Brazilian smartphone sales peaked in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, with about 1% of the market, according to Tina Lu, head of Counterpoint Research for Latin America. Everything they were selling, they were selling at a loss, she said. Unless you assemble devices locally, you face taxes of about 60 percent. Xiaomi explored, but never finalized, plans to manufacture devices in Brazil.A former employee at Xiaomis Brazil office, which once employed 23 people, said local management struggled to distinguish itself. Beyond the pricing and brand challenges, the outpost had a difficult time coordinating strategy with Beijing, the person said.Replicating Xiaomis early success in developing economies turned out to be elusive -- with obstacles ranging from Brazils heavy taxes on foreign-assembled devices; to patent-infringement lawsuits in India; to the slow adoption of e-commerce in most developing countries compared with China.A lot of people, including myself, once thought that if a Chinese technology company can make it there in China, it can make it anywhere. But I got that wrong, said Clay Shirky, an associate professor at NYU Shanghai and author of the 2015 book on Xiaomi, Little Rice: Smartphones, Xiaomi, and the Chinese Dream.Now Xiaomi will turn greater attention to fighting for its home turf. In his recent letter to employers, Lei Jun admitted the company had lost focus as it attempted rapid expansion, into both new products and countries. Thats why we must slow our pace, and seriously learn from our mistakes, he wrote.Barra isnt the only executive departing amid the slowdown. In October, Chen Tong, a vice-president for content at Xiaomi, left the company to join news platform Yidianzixun. Zhang Jinling, a vice-president managing finance and investments, left to join Baidu Inc. Chen did not respond to a request for comment, and Zhang declined to comment.They had some glory days in the past. One can never count them out, said Tse. But for them to really come back, they need to do a lot of hard work to rebuild the brand. People in China view it now as a declining brand. Bloomberg",2017-01-27,1b62RMQZOeDcrsfVN26CTN,"Hugo Barra had joined Xiaomi with an ambitious vision, but failed to predict and overcome rapid changes in the global smartphone market.",18:46,"Hugo Barra, in shift to Facebook, leaves behind unfinished expansion at Xiaomi"
0.25,"At a time when the Indian banking industry is grappling with bad loans, a consistent performer like HDFC Bank Ltd is much sought after by investors. That is why the lender, also the countrys most valuable bank, enjoys a price-to-book valuation of 3.7, well above its peers. The premium reflects investor confidence in its ability to deliver stable earnings. As usual, HDFC Bank met expectations on most counts in its June quarter earnings. Net profit rose 20.14% year-on-year, (y-o-y) backed by growth in its retail business. In the March quarter, net profit had risen 20.2%. Thats how consistent HDFC Banks profit growth has been.Net interest income (NII) grew 22% y-o-y. Surprisingly, the net interest margin (NIM), which had been expected to remain stable, rose sequentially to 4.4% in the quarter from 4.3%, aided by moderating deposit costs. Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) and net NPAs rose sequentially to 1.04% and 0.32% of the total loan book, respectively, because of defaults in the small and medium enterprises segment. Provisions for bad loans increased 19% y-o-y and 30.8% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q), in part due to funds set aside for loans to Punjab for food procurement. Analysts dont see the marginal rise in bad loans as a concern. Also, the spike seen in provisions is due to a one-off factor and one shouldnt read too much into it, they say. HDFC Banks current and savings account (CASA) ratio was stable y-o-y at 40%; although it was lower than the 43% seen in the March 2016 quarter. While the bank is making efforts to expand branches, pushing CASA to higher levels would be a challenge. Its a measure of investors confidence in HDFC Bank that its shares touched an all-time high of Rs.1,239.90, before closing down a mere 0.15% on the Nifty on Thursday, while the Nifty Private Bank Index fell 1.55%.",2016-07-22,1iF4kfghejYWf5g0VepdZL,"As usual, HDFC Bank met expectations on most counts in its June quarter earnings

Helping the rebound is a strong product pipeline and the belief that these new products will offset potential weakness in the business environment in the coming season.
				   
				Bayer CropScience plans to register 20 new products by 2020, of which four are scheduled to be launched next fiscal year. One of its peers, PI Industries Ltd, is estimated to launch one-two products per annum in the domestic market and another, Dhanuka Agritech Ltd, two-three (exclusive) products, data from Edelweiss Securities Ltd shows.According to B&K Securities India Pvt. Ltd, Bayer is also planning to launch new trait rice seeds and a cotton hybrid. While last 10-15 years have been spent on strengthening distribution reach and connect with farmers, Bayer is now complementing it with a strong product pipeline, B&K Securities said in a note.The strong product pipeline can help cushion Bayer from the vagaries of agricultural demand. It gained market share in cotton seeds despite a drop in the industry volumes in the previous summer crop season (kharif). In agrochemicals, Bayer plans to capitalize on strong traction for herbicides through new molecules. According to Edelweiss, the company aims to increase the share of herbicides in revenue from the current 17% to 40% in 2020.The launches will complement six new products Bayer introduced over the last two years. Consistent new product launches supported by strong pipeline will continue to drive growth, Edelweiss said in a note. B&K Securities estimates the new products to contribute half of Bayers incremental growth by 2020. Currently the share of revenue generated from products introduced in the last five years stands at around 20%.While the product pipeline looks strong, the performance so far this fiscal year has been a dampener. Revenue dropped 10% in the last quarter. In the nine months to December, revenue is up just 2%. The performance was hit by external factors like weak demand and unfavourable climatic conditions.With the company enhancing its product portfolio, the performance in the coming season should be better than in the year gone by.

0.1,"Mumbai: Against trillions of rupees of fiscal and tax gains projected from the note ban, a domestic brokerage on Wednesday said the government may gain only Rs72,800 crore from the movetaxes, penalties worth Rs32,800 crore and Rs40,000 crore by way of surplus transfer from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). 
				   
				Many pro-demonetisation economists and analysts had in the early days of the move claimed at least 20% of the Rs15.55 trillion of cancelled money would not come back to the system, which in turn, could enable the RBI to write off that amount from its balancesheet. The profit accretion could then be transferred to the government by the RBI as surplus transfer. While the central bank had publicly cited only Rs15.55 trillion of high value notes were cancelled on 8 November, in an RTI reply to PTI, it had said the actual quantum of bills cancelled was much higher at Rs20.51 trillion. ALSO READ: No records of fake currency deposited in banks: RBIBut according to a report by domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal, this could just be a whimper of the initial projection at Rs40,000 crore, which means only around 3.5% of the cancelled money was not returned to the system or were black money. The brokerage said while RBI has not provided any data on deposited notes after 10 December, calculations using official data on currency in circulation and total supply of bills by 19 December show that over Rs15 trillion has come back to the system. Thus, the RBI could transfer a maximum of Rs40,000 crore to the government, which will be included in the latters non-tax revenue receipts for the next fiscal, the report said. Additional taxes worth Rs32,800 crore and non-tax revenue of Rs40,000 crore will add Rs72,800 crore to the governments kitty next year, it said. But this is based on the broking firms assessment of the cancelled money which came back to the system till 19 December. So far, neither the RBI nor the government has quantified the money that came back to the system. As per the brokerages estimates, the income tax department may be able to unearth only Rs28,500 crore as black money, representing 50% of the income considered to be declared under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana scheme.

-0.07,"Davos: Open markets and global trade have been blamed for job losses over the last decade, but global chief executive officers say the real culprits are increasingly machines.
				   
				And while business leaders gathered at the annual World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos relish the productivity gains technology can bring, they warned this week that the collateral damage to jobs needs to be addressed more seriously.From taxi drivers to healthcare professionals, technologies such as robotics, driverless cars, artificial intelligence and 3-D printing mean more and more types of jobs are at risk. Adidas, for example, aims to use 3-D printing in the manufacture of some running shoes.Jobs will be lost, jobs will evolve and this revolution is going to be ageless, its going to be classless and its going to affect everyone, said Meg Whitman, chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise.So while some supporters of Donald Trump and Brexit may hope new government policies will bring lost jobs back to Americas Rust Belt or Britains industrial north, economists estimate 86% of US manufacturing job losses are actually down to productivity, according to the WEFs annual risks report.Technology is the big issue and we dont acknowledge that, Mark Weinberger, chairman of consultancy EY, said on Thursday, arguing there was a tendency to always blame trading partners.The political backdrop is prompting CEOs to take more seriously the challenge of long-life training of workforces to keep up with the exponential growth of technological advances. I think what were reaching now is a time when we may have to find alternative careers through our lifetime, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella told Reuters. Over the last decade, more jobs have been lost to technology than any other factor, and John Drzik, head of global risk at insurance broker Marsh, expects more of the same. That is going to raise challenges, particularly given the political context, Drzik, who helped compile the WEF report, said.Compared to clamping down on immigration by tightening borders, dealing with the impact of technology destroying jobs is something that is perhaps even less easily controlled.For while many advanced technologies remain more expensive than low- or medium-skilled labour in the near term, the shift is likely to accelerate as costs come down.Widening gapTechnological advancements require governments, businesses and academic institutions to develop more educated and highly skilled workforces, executives in Davos said.But this shift to skilled workers also widens the income gap and fuels growing inequality.Jonas Prising, CEO of staffing firm ManpowerGroup, noted that US unemployment is only about 2 to 2.5% among college-educated people but 9 or 10 percent among those with low or no skills.The idea that we would ban automation as part of an evolution within the manufacturing industry, is not really part of the discussion, Prising said. He pointed to policies in countries like Denmark and Italy, where there is a focus on employability of workers.If we dont own responsibility (for the problem of displaced workers), its only going to get bigger, Procter & Gamble Chief Executive David Taylor said.Brawn and brainThe scope of the employment risk from what the WEF calls the fourth industrial revolution which blurs the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres is unclear.A University of Oxford study in 2013 said nearly half of US jobs were at risk, while in 2015 Forrester Research predicted a net loss of only 7% by 2025, as some lost jobs will be replaced with new ones. Forrester predicts that by 2019, one-quarter of all job tasks will be offloaded to software robots, physical robots, or customer self-service automation.

				CDPQ, which set up its India office in March, has announced $850-million capital for power projects in India, and investments in Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd and in TVS Logistics Services Ltd.In an interview, Anita Marangoly George, managing director (South Asia) at CDPQ, comments on the present scenario in India and the pension funds investment plans.Edited excerpts:Limited partners (LPs) have complained about under-performance of Indian PE and have decided to do investments directly. Do you believe direct investment is a good option for large investors like CDPQ?Weak PE returns is not an issue that is intrinsic to India alone and is not the sole reason why the LPs are interested in direct investments.There is a renewed interest in the way LPs are looking at the India story which is driven by the fundamentals of the Indian economy. As LPs get to know the opportunities and the partners in different sectors, they are more comfortable investing directly. Other reasons could include economic considerations on saving carry (carried interest) and fees; better governance in terms of flexibility and exercising more control on investment decisions and how they deploy capital; and scaling up internal capabilities are just a few reasons why the LPs are going the direct route. For long-term investors like CDPQ, it is also important to consider the timing of entering a new market and the exit where institutional investors may have a different time horizon relative to PE funds. Last, but not the least, in a long-term relationship, the quality of the local partner is vital to us.How does CDPQ see India as an investment destination as compared to the other Asian markets?Indias story is ultimately not just about the growth rates, its about potential that rests on economic fundamentals. First, the labour force, its one of the most attractive in the world, young and growing at a remarkable rate. Over 10 million new entrants a year are expected over the next decade. Second, Indias governanceno doubt, there is a new tone on the top on this issue and progress is being made. A stable and principled system of public and corporate governance is a prerequisite for investor confidence and for long-term, sustainable growth.Third, Indias structural reforms that are gradually changing will make India a more competitive player in the global economy and better equip it for future growth.Which sectors are attractive ones for CDPQ in India?Thinking long-term, thinking like a business owner, are opportunities we believe are key. We are particularly keen on themes like  financial services, renewables, real estate, healthcare, and transport and logistics. Fintech (financial technology) is reshaping the landscape of financial serviceshow they are delivered and who delivers them. With renewables, we identify that India will need more power and has the opportunity to develop it in a way that keeps its cities liveable and potentially provide a competitive advantage. Transportation and logistics is critical to create a common market to create and build the transportation logistics capabilities required to move goods efficiently.How do you see Indias growth in ICT sector? And potential for investments?Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) is one of the fastest growing parts of Indias economy and the largest private employer in the country. Over the next five years, it is estimated that at least 33% more citizens will gain access to the Internet,  and the number of smartphone users will grow to 700 million or more by 2025, from 200 million last year. All of these open the door to a world of connectivity, knowledge and opportunity. But what really matters is Indias long history of entrepreneurship and innovation. Today, India ranks as the second-most important ICT start-up hub in the world and ICT is remaking the global economy, disrupting businesses and business models every day.

0.54,"New Delhi: With less than two months left to meet the deadline set by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), banks are moving towards enabling ATMs and point of sale (PoS) machines they will install in the new year to allow Aadhaar-based biometric authentication. 
				   
				Banks say there is still a long way to go before the supporting infrastructure is put in place for biometric authentication-based transactions on ATMs and PoS machines.Last month, RBI issued a notification asking all banks to ensure that ATMs and PoS machines deployed from 1 January are enabled for accepting chip-enabled cards as well as those authenticated using a personal identification number (PIN) or the Aadhaar unique identification number and biometric verification.The decision came on the recommendation of a working group established by RBI favouring the use of Aadhaar as an effective alternative for additional authentication of  domestic card transactions. It is the incremental engagement that is getting secured, but the existing inventory also needs to be updated in order to eliminate the chances of data breach, said Puneet Kapoor, senior executive vice-president at Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. It will take some time before we reach a position where we can say that we have really optimized the opportunity of biometric authentication.The introduction of biometric-enabled PoS machines will allow more people to perform Aadhaar-based financial transactions because of the large issuance of RuPay cards under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, a government initiative to ensure every household has access to a bank account, said Ritesh Pai, senior president and country head of digital banking at Yes Bank Ltd. Biometric-enabled PoS machines are also expected to ease the experience of financial transactions for a large number of users and it also ensures higher security levels, Pai added. This will spur a gradual adoption of such infrastructure throughout the ecosystem, and eventually we are likely to see only biometric-enabled infrastructure to be present for card acceptance with older devices being replaced.With more than 1.07 billion Aadhaar enrolments, the use of Aadhaar for authentication of proof of identity and proof of address and for electronic know your customer verification is expected to pick up in the coming months.For a card present transaction, PIN is a factor for authentication. In the place of the PIN, we can use biometric authentication. The latter will be more authentic in comparison to the first one, said an official at Federal Bank who didnt want to be named. So, theoretically at least, if the card is dumped, the thumbprint alone will be only a single factor authentication, though more secure than the card and PIN combo.This official said RBIs 1 January deadline will be a challenge for banks to meet.Delta ID Inc., an iris scan technology developer, is in talks with some banks for use of its software in PoS terminals and ATMs.With the addition of biometrics, payments will change for the better for both consumers and banks.

The Reserve Bank of India had noted in its bi-annual Financial Stability Report, released in June that 86% of banks bad loans were taken by large borrowers, who accounted for 58% of total loans. A large borrower is defined as a borrower who has aggregate exposure of Rs50 million and above. And the top 10 conglomerate groups do account for a significant chunk of bank borrowings in the country, as the first part of this series pointed out.However, it will be wrong to presume that Indias excessive debt problem is limited to the very large firms. A Mint analysis of 305 listed non-financial companies shows it is actually the smaller companies that are saddled with the highest amount of debt relative to their market capitalization. These 305 companies are those non-financial firms belonging to the BSE-500 universe for which past data is available. The BSE-500 index accounts for over 90% of market capitalization on the bourse.The average debt of the bottom quartile of companies, ranked by their market capitalization, is around 2.3 times their market capitalization. On the other hand, the average debt burden of the top quartile of companies amounts to less than one-third of their market capitalization. The trends are roughly similar when we compare the debt to equity ratios of the 305 listed non-financial companies. Debt-equity ratios for the smallest firms in the BSE-500 universe are significantly higher than that for the biggest firms. The smaller companies have witnessed the fastest debt pile-up in the last 10 years. Moreover, the ability of these smaller companies to meet their interest expense is also the worst compared to the rest. The ability to meet interest expenses is at a 10-year low for both the top and bottom quartiles but the bottom quartile fares worse. The interest coverage ratio for the bottom quartile has slipped below one in FY16 for the sample under consideration. This means that they dont earn enough in operating income to meet their interest expense. The decline in inflation is partly responsible for the fall in the interest coverage ratio over the past couple of years but the fall also reflects an inability to grow revenues substantially. The median firm in the top quartile earned Rs14,217 crore in net sales over the past fiscal year while the median firm in the bottom quartile earned Rs1,658 crore in net sales over the same period.As a Mint column by Ravi Krishnan had pointed out earlier, smaller firms tend to be affected more when businesses are struggling to grow. Given their high leverage ratios the first domino to fall in a high-stress environment could well be a small-cap firm.This is the second part of a four-part data journalism series on corporate debt in the country.

0.07,"An investment recovery and the health of the banking system are inextricably linked. The banking industry needs cash. Bloated with bad loans, state-owned banks require Rs.1 trillion in the near term, estimate brokerage firms and rating agencies. The government, on the other hand, has allotted only Rs.25,000 crore for this year under its so-called Indradhanush programme.
				   
				Consider this statistic: In the December quarter alone, banks posted a cumulative loss of Rs.10,911 crore, which is slightly over two-fifths of governments proposed capital infusion. Credit Suisse estimates that unprovided problem loans are now at 65-200% of public sector banks capital.The capital requirement will grow further as most banks are yet to recognize some more bad loans. The chart shows how badly banks need capital. Overall, estimated capital requirement for the banking system is between Rs.2.5 trillion and Rs.3 trillion over the next four years compared with the governments promise of Rs.70,000 crore.Clearly, given its fiscal constraints the government may not be able to cough up any huge amount upfront, especially after the Seventh Pay Commission and 14th Finance Commission recommendations. The solution to the bad loan problem, which will free up cash for banks and enable them to accumulate it out of profits, lies in policy measures.A comprehensive bankruptcy code was promised in the last budget; it is in the works and yet to become law. Another idea that has taken hold in recent times is the creation of a bad bank, some version of the USs Troubled Asset Relief Programme after the 2008 crisis. This would be a sovereign-backed asset reconstruction company. But that doesnt save taxpayers from taking a hit as someone would have to make good those losses. It also creates a moral hazard as banks arent made liable for their past bad decisions.Of course, the government can reduce its stake below 51% in public sector banks. It can always bring down its stake to 33% while still keeping voting rights intact. The big concern here is cheap valuations currently and hurdles from bank unions and accusations of selling the family silver. That would be the first step in injecting some much-required capital.",2016-02-26,2pfYg9dpuy859sgse4uvTN,"Overall, estimated capital requirement for the banking system is between Rs2.5 trillion and Rs3 trillion over the next four years compared with the governments promise of Rs70,000 crore

-0.42,"Listed Indian banks have had their worst three quarters in history with these past nine months culminating in a massive drop of almost 30% in profit, a doubling of the bad loan pile and additional trouble of capital depletion for public sector banks. But have banks learnt their lesson? Have they wised up in the nine months and provided for every rupee they learnt had turned toxic?
				   
				The answer is not a straight and comforting yes. Two numbers indicate that banks could still be swimming naked in the bad loan pool. One is the provisions of banks towards bad loans and second is the provision coverage ratio (PCR). Of the 39 listed banks that have declared results for the September quarter (Jammu and Kashmir Bank is yet to release its numbers), 30 lenders saw their PCR drop sharply from a year ago. Axis Bank saw the biggest drop in the ratio to 59% in the September quarter from 78% a year ago. The worst of the lot were South Indian Bank and Punjab and Sind Bank, both having a ratio of just 46%.PCR is a measure of funds kept aside by a bank to cover bad loans. A higher PCR means the bank is protecting itself better against its bad loans. It is clear that lenders are yet to make the required prudent provisions against bad loans. This is frightening for the outlook on profitability for banks in the coming quarters. As bad loans age and more loans slip every quarter, provisions are unlikely to come down. If the momentum of provisioning remains the same, loss-making banks may not be able to swing to profit and those making profits are unlikely to increase the growth in their earnings. For the sector as a whole, provisions rose by 80% in the September quarter but the bad loan stockpile bloated by a greater 105% on a net basis. To avoid painting every bank with the same brush, provisions rose at a faster pace than bad loan accretion in 16 banks. Now, have investors taken note of the worsening coverage ratio? One look at the price-to-book value multiple of the 30 banks that saw a sharp drop in PCR shows that the Street is yet to completely wake up to this grim picture. These lenders havent seen a big erosion in their multiples.

				For years, UCWeb Inc., a subsidiary of Chinas Internet giant Alibaba, steadily rolled out updates designed for its Indian customers, like data saving modes, and blocking data-intensive ads by default.Focus on content, too, helped. UC Browser has a cricket section with live scores and videos, built-in music in  partnership with Hungama, and UC News, a content-aggregation service.Indians love content. They want to download videos but they are not able to because of the data speeds. We have done a lot of localization in this area with the built-in download manager and give access to content through partnerships, said Robert Bu, general manager at UCWeb India.To be sure, its not the only browser offering features like these any longer. Googles Chrome division and Opera, too, have realized the unique needs of users in markets like India and have released a slew of updates.Google in September announced  Chrome will have a data saving mode, optimize web pages when on 2G networks and easily download media for offline use.We have made a strategic shift team-wide to prioritize the mobile web and helping users in mobile-first markets such as India. To prepare for building the best browsing experience in mobile, we conducted extensive research around user behaviour in India, said Rahul Roy-Chowdhury, vice-president at Chrome, in an email response to queries from Mint.In some cases, we were missing some features that our users wanted, such as offline functionality. In other cases, we had useful functionality but didnt make it easy for users to find them, for example the Chrome Data Saver feature. We also realized that for many users, specially new users, we needed to do more to help them find the content they cared about. We have worked quickly to address these issues, Roy-Chowdhury added. While Operas data saving modes were always popular, in January, it, too, announced that its browser would be available in 13 regional languages (UC Browser is available in 11 languages).India is the top market for us, but considering the potential for Internet growth here, we think the market is still there to capture. We have very strong partnerships with original equipment manufacturers and thats going to be one of the ways in which we cater to new users, said Sunil Kamath, vice-president for South Asia and South-East Asia at Opera Software.Although independent experts agree UC Browser leads the market, there is some dispute about the extent of its dominance. Opera, for instance, claims 50 million monthly active users from India, compared with UC Browsers 80 million. Opera has a 17.51% market share and Chrome has 15.73%, according to StatCounter data. UC has understood the needs of a new mobile user (especially in emerging markets) and has adapted its service to suit it, such as easy access to most used services. This enabled it to compete effectively with Opera. Chrome on the other hand does have a mobile first strategy but is supported by a suite of complementary apps by Google and isnt a one-stop shop like UC. This differentiates UC from the very popular chrome browser, said Neha Dharia, senior analyst at research firm Ovum Ltd. UC Browser has essentially become a web-app platform. If you let it, the browser takes over phone functions such as lock screen, notifications and music player. Users can access app-like experiences of popular services like Facebook, Flipkart and Paytm from within the browser itself.UC wants to ensure users spend as much time as they can within the browser. Keeping the user within the ecosystem is a strategy followed by Facebook, Google and all the other big digital players, said Dharia.UCWebs 30 India staffers are supported by a large group in Guangzhou in China, according to Bu. UCWeb has more than 2,000 employees worldwide.The firm credits its popularity to word-of-mouth publicity, but it has steadily been investing in traditional marketing channels. In August, it launched a television commercial to promote UC News. Last year, it hired cricketer Yuvraj Singh as brand ambassador.UCWeb hasnt always had it easy though. The firm was caught in a controversy in May last year over its data sharing practices. Documents leaked by US intelligence whistleblower Edward Snowden showed the browser was sending personally identifiable information which was being used by Western intelligence agencies to spy on certain individuals.Citizen Lab, a research lab based in the University of Toronto, published a report that identified security vulnerabilities in the browser in May 2015.

0.57,"Reacting to the railway budget, one industry stakeholder told a business news channel that he was happy with the announcements as long as he didnt think about how they would be funded. That aptly sums up the mood on the Street, which dumped railway-related stocks after the budget was presented.The highlight, of course, is the scaling up of capital expenditure (capex) to Rs.1.2 trillion for the next fiscal year, which is entirely commendable. But believing the big numbers requires a leap of faith.First, the targets set for the current fiscal year are seeing sharp cuts. Capex for the current year has been revised down from around Rs.1 trillion to Rs.82,192 crore. To be sure, thats far higher than what the railways has been clocking for years. But as of December, the national transporter spent only 64% of the revised capex target, an increase of less than one-fourth from the year-ago period.The second problem is resource generation. After meeting all expenditure, Indian Railways is estimated to generate net revenue of Rs.18,210 crore in the next fiscal year. It is not only 8% less than the current fiscal years revised estimate (which itself has been cut) but is also prone to serious downward revisions.Total traffic receipts (both from freight and passenger fares) are estimated to rise 10%, optimistic considering the lack of upward revision of tariffs. As in the previous budget, the ministry is projecting a double-digit (12%) growth in passenger earnings, when the number of passengers is actually declining. The expected fall is 1.5% in the current fiscal year. This year, passenger revenue is expected to go up by 7%. True, freight revenue growth projections are realistic at 5%. But lack of time-bound measures to revive the flagging volumesestimated to grow just 1% in the current fiscal yearhas been a disappointment.Of course, a significant part of the Plan expenditure is funded by support from the Union budget, borrowings and institutional finance. But as Religare Capital Markets Ltd points out, resources from all these sources have fallen short of budget estimates. If economic activity does not see a meaningful recovery and the governments fiscal position remains stretched, then it is likely the budgetary support for next fiscal year will also be constrained.The railways plans to further lower costs and boost non-traffic revenue. While the ministry has achieved some success in cost-control measures, non-traffic revenue is showing no signs of improvement yetin fact, it is expected to fall 8% this year.All this gives way to some doubts about the budget estimates. The poor performance in FY16 has few excuses, unless the projections for FY16 were too ambitious to begin with, Religare Capital Markets wrote in a note. One cannot help but be sceptical of FY17 projections, therefore, especially on the funding part of the planned expenditure.However, there is no denying that the railways capex is growing. As Dilip Bhat, joint managing director at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd, points out, even if the railways manages to achieve capex of Rs.1 trillion next fiscal year, it will be a significant improvement from the Rs.40,000-60,000 crore the organization was spending some years back.While that is a clear indication of the governments push to kick-start growth through increased public investments, the fact remains that the numbers need to be taken with a pinch of salt.",2016-02-26,4K3Wxb6Muf9pmFztI6WoqM,"The highlight of railways budget is the scaling up of capital expenditure to Rs1.2 trillion for the next fiscal year, which is commendable, but believing the big numbers requires a leap of faith

				Yahoo chief executive officer Marissa Mayer will assist with the transition until the sale is complete and then depart the company with a comfortable parachute worth more than $50 million in cash and stock. So lets not weep for her. But inevitably, a passel of eulogies will be crafted about her failed four-year attempt to turn around the company. These reflections will be largely unfair, because the decline and demise of Yahoo isnt totally her fault. Its at least partially the fault of its founders, Jerry Yang and David Filo.The early story of Yahoo is now Silicon Valley mythology. As graduate students at the Stanford School of Engineering in 1994, Yang, a math-oriented Taiwanese immigrant, and Filo, a quiet programmer from Louisiana, created a directory of links called Jerry and Davids Guide to the World Wide Web. It was a handy map to what was then an unnavigable digital landscape, and web surfers loved it. The following year, when Sequoia Capital invested in the newly renamed start-up, it brought in a former Motorola executive named Tim Koogle to be CEO.The move reflected the reigning conventional wisdom of the timebring in an experienced chief executive and go public early. But while they stepped aside to become chief Yahoos, as their business cards said, Filo and Yang stayed intimately involved. Filo, as the technical leader, wrote the very first version of Yahoo search and made the bulk of decisions about the companys underlying technical architecture. Yang stayed close to strategic decisions and was instrumental after the dot-com crash in replacing Koogle with Terry Semel, the longtime co-CEO of Warner Brothers.Semel brought with him a core group of native media execs whose names are now familiar in Silicon Valley, like Jeff Weiner, the CEO of LinkedIn, and Dan Rosensweig, CEO of textbook rental service Chegg. This was the origin of what would become Yahoos enduring split-personality: Was it a technology company or a media company? Sitting on perhaps the most valuable piece of real estate on the web, shuttling between its offices in Santa Monica, California, and Sunnyvale, Yahoo executives tried to be a little bit of both.Also Read: Verizon buys Yahoo, Marissa Mayer says planning to stayWe now know what it takes for technology companies to succeed: fierce, often unpleasant, founders who are able to make hard choices and place unpopular bets. During the years that Yahoo was banking on the media business, Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com, for example, expanded into unprofitable lines of online retail, brooked a painfully hollow stock price, cut workers, and finally spawned a completely different business in the cloud, called Amazon Web Services. At Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin brought in Eric Schmidt as CEO, but they governed as a triumvirate of equals, inventing an insanely profitable text advertising business that augmented web search results, rather than distracting from them like Yahoos eye-ball burning banner ads.During the 2000s, Yahoos biggest mistakes were failures of will. Semel, billed as a deals guy from Hollywood, could have bought Google in 2002, as Fred Vogelstein reported in Wired. Yahoo also came close to buying Facebook in 2006, until Semel lowered his offer from $1 billion to $850 million after a disappointing earnings report, alienating an already reluctant Mark Zuckerberg in the process, according to David Kirkpatricks book, The Facebook Effect.These acquisitions probably looked like risky, uneconomical moves that Yahoo investors might hate. Thats the whole point. Web companies need the unique power of founders to do unpopular things. Page advocated for Google to buy the money-losing video sharing site YouTube in 2006; Zuckerberg made what seemed like an outrageously overpriced bet on the photo app Instagram in 2012. This is how tech companies survivethe ability to take risks.Yang took over as CEO from Semel in 2007 but was either too nice or too unwilling to make hard decisions. In retrospect, he should have fired more employees, and banked hard toward technology and the emerging smartphone revolution. In what now looks like his biggest blunder, he turned away one of the best exits Yahoo would ever see, Microsofts unsolicited $45 billion bid in 2008, an effort by then CEO Steve Ballmer to compete with Google.Also Read: Yahoos Tumblr unveils live videoIn what should now be the canonical photo of Yahoos decline, from the Allen & Co. conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, that June, Yang was pictured sitting with Page and Brin, his head in his hands, presumably bemoaning the overture from the big, lame software blunderbuss from the north. The photo reveals Yangs confusion at the time about Yahoos true enemy. It was not Ballmer and his gang of Windows fanatics. It was the Google guys, there listening supportively across the table from him.After that, it was pretty much over for slow-footed Yahoo, trying to navigate a fast-changing internet landscape with uninspired CEOs like Carol Bartz and Scott Thompson at the helm. In periodically leaked missives, executives bemoaned that Yahoo was spreading itself too thin over too many lackluster products. Without a steadier hand from its founders, Yahoo had lost its way culturally as much as strategically. It was fat with layers of accountants, lawyers, and product managers, people whose job it was to mitigate risk, rather than take it. Yang didnt respond to requests for comment, and Filo declined to comment through a spokeswoman.The founders did make big contributions. In 2005, Yang helped orchestrate what would be the companys best deal: the sale of its businesses in China to Alibaba, along with a $1 billion investment. He deserves tons of credit for that. Its also likely that his voice was not always heard. In 2012, Yang left the companys board of directors after its disastrous decision to hire PayPals Scott Thompson as CEO and then promptly fire him upon discovering he fibbed on his résumé. For his part, Filo has been the picture of corporate loyalty in an age sorely lacking it. He joined the Yahoo board when Mayer took over the company and, by all accounts, remains an inspirational figure.But by that time, the mistakes of the past loomed too large. Perhaps there was a short window of opportunity for Mayer to bet the company on a bold acquisition or a new product, but it closed fast. She made strange moves, spending a huge chunk of her figurative and literal capital on a $1.1 billion deal for the also-ran social network Tumblr in 2013. Tumblr, like so many other Yahoo acquisitions (Flickr, et al.) went nowhere fast, perhaps because there were not enough nutrients in the Yahoo soil for any startup to thrive.Others have chronicled more of Mayers mistakes. But now its all ancient internet history, to be parceled out and puzzled over by business school students. Its time for us to mourn Yahoo. Sorry, I meanYahoo!

-0.96,"Mumbai: Tata Steel Ltd on Friday said it swung to a loss in the quarter ended 30 September, hurt by weak operations in the United Kingdom.
				   
				The steel maker reported a consolidated net loss of Rs49.38 crore for the quarter, compared with a net profit of Rs5,609.43 crore a year ago. Net sales edged up 0.2% to Rs27,392.06 crore from Rs27,339.37 crore a year earlier.Fifteen analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected Tata Steel to report a consolidated net profit of Rs712.3 crore, while 16 analysts had expected sales of Rs27,334.70 crore.India business revenue rose 10.1% to Rs11,718.31 crore. Revenue at Tata Steel Europe fell 13.7% to Rs12,357.69 crore. Finance costs in the quarter rose 22.8% to Rs1,351.06 crore.The company said that its deliveries in the September quarter stood at 5.65 million tonnes.Tata Steel has been grappling with rising shipments from China, where an economic slowdown has depressed demand and put steel prices under pressure.Over the past year, Tata Steel has cut jobs and shuttered some of its plants in Europe, blaming cheap Chinese imports, a strong pound and high costs for its decision.Tata Sons Ltds ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry had played a key role in discussions about merging Tata Steels European operations with those of Thyssenkrupp AG. Tata Steel said it is still involved in discussions with the German company for a potential joint venture and that the process of selling Tata Steel UKs speciality steels business and its Hartlepool pipe mills are ongoing.Tata Steel UK is deeply engaged with all relevant stakeholders in the UK including the unions, the pension trustees and the pension regulators to find a structural solution and a way forward with regards to the affordability of the legacy pension scheme liabilities. Discussions are currently ongoing, the company said in a statement.Strong monsoons affected steel demand across the country while the increase in domestic capacity added to the competitive pressure... There was a sharp drop in realizations which coupled with the ramp-up costs at the Kalinganagar plant kept margins under pressure. While realizations have since improved, rising coal prices will affect margins in the short run and will necessitate increase in steel realizations going forward, said T.V. Narendran, managing director of Tata Steel India and South-East Asia.In March, Tata Steel decided to put its entire UK business on the block in the face of a slump in steel demand and prices, but the plan hit a roadblock due to uncertainty stemming from Britains decision to exit the European Union.The group eventually halted the sale process in July in favour of discussions for a joint venture with strategic players in the steel industry, including Thyssenkrupp.As of 30 September, Tata Steels net debt stood at Rs75,563 crore.Overall numbers were below expectations. India business was weak due to Kalinganagar impacting the overall mix and the Europe margin rise was not as expected. The other divisions also did not perform well. For the next two-thirds quarters, Kalinganagar will continue to impact negatively. The spat with Cyrus Mistry did not come up on the post-results call with management, but this is likely to hurt all Tata group company stocks, said an analyst, asking not to be named as he is not authorized to speak to the media.",2016-11-11,4QP1LjfPhJVC9adC8JS5nO,"Hurt by weak UK operations, Tata Steel reports Rs49.38 crore loss ",19:14,Tata Steel swings to loss in September quarter
0.43,"On 27 and 28 February, five teams from India will present their models on how Hyperloop can be used to  connect Bengaluru to Thiruvananthapuram, Chennai to Bengaluru (two teams), Mumbai to Chennai, and Mumbai to Delhi.
				   
				Hyperloop, a low-pressure tube in which magnetically levitated pod-like vehicles can ferry passengers, sometimes at speeds in excess of 1,000 kmph, is the brainchild of Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX and Tesla Motors. But Musk, busy with his other ventures, is not developing a commercial Hyperloop. Two firmsHyperloop One and Hyperloop Transportation Technologies Inc. (HTT)are, and both are keen to introduce the Hyperloop in India. Hyperloop One is currently building a prototype in the Nevada desert in the US. Simultaneously, it is scouting for partners to whom it can license its technology to build Hyperloop routes in various countries. To that end, it launched a global competitionthe Hyperloop One Global Challengein which several consortia participated. Of these, 30 were shortlisted, including five from India, (prn.to/2jwi9UP), according to Nick Earle, senior vice-president of global field operations, Hyperloop One.By March this year, said Earle, who is on his first visit to India, we will demonstrate a pod travelling in passive magnetic levitation in a forward motion inside a pressure-reduced tube (not 100% vacuum). We are just weeks away from proving the technology with the worlds first demonstration.Unlike what his competitors are doing, insists Earle, the build-out at Nevada is a full-scale prototype with everything that you need to build a real-world Hyperloop. He said his companys philosophy is to build it, engineer it, prove that it works and then go to different countries to deploy it.Earle and his team are in India to meet government officials and potential partners and review the work of the five Indian teams. When we look at which country could benefit the most from Hyperloop, we look for large ridership population or freight demand, GDP growth, requirement for national productivity,  and the engineering and academic prowess to build this locally, said Earle who likens the Hyperloop concept to broadband for transportation.India, then, is a natural fit. Alan James, vice-president of worldwide business development for passenger systems at Hyperloop One added, India is the primary spot in Asia as far as Hyperloop is concerned.Hyperloop Ones rival HTT was founded on a crowd-funding model. In December, Bibop Gresta, chairman and co-founder of HTT, met Indias union minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari (bit.ly/2glawkG), and proposed linking  Mumbai and Pune with its ultra-high speed transport system. The cost (of building the track) depends on the location. To be generic, it will be $40 million per km. But it is one-fourth of high-speed rail. When you consider investment in infrastructure, you also consider how fast you can recoup it. This investment can be recouped in eight years, Gresta said. HTT has an exclusive agreement with the US-based Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for using its passive magnetic levitation system as the core of low-cost, safety-conscious construction and design in its Hyperloop, according to the companys website.Maglev, or magnetic levitation, is a technology that enables a train to float 1-6 inches above the track on a cushion of magnetic power and runs at a minimum speed of 350 kmph and a maximum of 500 kmph.Earle too says the Hyperloop will cost less than high-speed trains50% or less compared to the cost of high-speed rail or similar transport systems over a 30-year operational cycle, but we expect economic benefits to be three-and-a-half to four times greater.Apart from HTT and Hyperloop One, Spains Talgo SA, Germanys Siemens AG and Knorr Bremse AG, are wooing Indian policymakers with their transport technologies. Mint reported on 5 January (bit.ly/2joNU4s) that the ministry of road transport and highways has sought approval from the Niti Aayog to experiment and introduce new mass rapid transportation technologies such as Hyperloop and pod-taxis. Some pilots are already in the works. For instance, a pod-taxi pilot, with Metrino-PRT,  will soon let passengers use Indias first driverless pods on a 12.3km stretch from the Delhi-Haryana border to Badshapur via Rajiv Chowk in Delhi and Iffco Chowk and Sohna Road in Gurgaon. The project will cost Rs800 crore. Indeed, across the country governments and government departments are setting aside money for such projects. The Indian Railways, which seems sincere about high-speed trains this time and which has been running some trials with them,  is planning a capital expenditure of around Rs1.3 trillion for the fiscal year 2017-18the highest-ever capital outlay and is expecting a gross budgetary support of around Rs55,000 crore from the finance ministry.To be sure, its early days yet for Hyperloop. The technology solution is some time away, and the cost of developing it will run into  billions of dollars. Both Hyperloop One and HTT are rushing to raise funds from investors.On 1 December, HTT said it surpassed $100 million in total investment. This included an equity investment of $31.8 million and in kind and land value investments of $77 million. Earle of Hyperloop One, on the other hand, insisted that all the $160 million his company has been able to raise so far is in real, hard cash.Meanwhile, critics of Hyperloop claim that at such high speeds, there could be health hazards arising from travelling in Hyperloop (which can be built on the ground, in tunnels or higher up on pylons). Dismissing these concerns, Earle believes that the travel experience will be similar to what people have in air travelonly, there would not be any turbulence because things here are happening in a controlled environmentAccording to Earle, an airplane starts stationary, then it accelerates at about 0.3-0.4gwhich is what the Hyperloop pod accelerates atit then goes up in the sky, whereas the pod stays close to the ground. The reason the plane goes up in the sky is that it needs low air pressure to travel at 600 miles an hour; we take the low air pressure and bring it down to the ground. In its final leg, the plane decelerates and stops; thats exactly how the Hyperloop works: stationary, accelerating at 0.3g, travelling at 700 miles an hour, decelerating and then stopping. The human body doesnt sense speed; it senses acceleration, which is the same as in air travel.Does Hyperloop make sense for a country like India?G. Raghuram, professor, Public Systems Group, at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, says the concept of Hyperloop is a good one, as it can reduce energy consumption significantly and speed up transport.  However, he cautions that from a safety point of view, the technology is yet to be proven. Also, Im not sure how useful it will be for a country like India that needs to transport people on a large scale.  In my opinion, India should not jump headlong into it but take a wait-and-watch approach and see the implementation elsewhere first.Still, the prospect of travelling from Mumbai to Pune in around 30 minutes or Delhi to Mumbai in under two hours, without flying, is attractive.",2017-01-27,4SR0XqWS2qbkhtr5rrPC5I,"Hyperloop One and Hyperloop Transportation Technologies Inc. are, and both are keen to introduce the Hyperloop in India",00:56,Can Hyperloop transform how Indians travel?
0.25,"Early-stage investors, it would appear, have rediscovered their love for the healthcare sector. Since March, investors have concluded around 17 deals that have something or the other to do with healthcare. There may be more deals. This is based on a quick scan of the deals that have been reported by various media outlets. Still , its a substantial number that looks suspiciously like another gold rush is in the making.
				   
				Lets break down the deals to see where the money is headed. There are at least five app-based start-ups in the mix. This month, HealthifyMe, an app that enables users to track their fitness and connects them with nutritionists and trainers, picked up $6 million in a Series A round of funds from IDG Ventures India, Inventus Capital and Blume Ventures. In April, DocsApp, an app that lets patients consult with doctors, raised $1.2 million in a seed round led by Japanese venture capital firm Rebright Partners. In March, LoveCycles, a womens health and menstrual cycle tracker, raised a $700,000 round from Prime Venture Partners.It wouldnt be a surprise to see more early-stage investors make a beeline for such app-based start-ups over other categories in healthcare. The space received a big push last year when Practo, the Sequoia Capital backed start-up, raised a $90 million Series C round of funds led by Chinas Tencent Holdings. The valuation of the eight-year-old company, following the round, reportedly jumped to over $500 million.Then there are a few companies that would fall in the so-called online pharmacy category. The most well known of the lot is 1mg, which raised a $15 million Series B round led by Maverick Capital Ventures, the venture capital arm of Dallas-based hedge fund Maverick Capital, last month. Another online pharmacy that got funded last month is CareOnGo. It raised an undisclosed sum in a seed round from FAO Ventures.There are also a couple of outliers. Accel Partners recently led a Series B funding round in medical devices firm Consure Medical. It is working on faecal incontinence management technology, which is aimed at helping critical care patients among others. Earlier in March, the Indian Angel Network invested an undisclosed sum in stem cells research firm Transcell Biologics.Brick-and-mortar healthcare services firms are still not back in favour with investors, relative to the interest in the healthcare technology segments. But there has been a smattering of deals in that area, too. A couple of days ago, AddressHealth, a pediatric services healthcare chain, raised $1.5 million from Gray Matters Capital and existing investor Unitus Seed Fund. Earlier this month, dental services chain Vatsalya Centre for Oral Health raised $1.6 million from S-Squared Capital Investments.The home healthcare services segment, within the brick-and-mortar category, may become more interesting to investors soon.In January, SAIF Partners led a $4 million funding round in Care24. India Quotient, which had seed-funded the company earlier, participated in the round. There have been some big funding rounds in this business in the recent past. Last year, Portea Medical closed a $37.5 million funding round led by its existing investor Accel Partners. World Bank arm International Finance Corporation jumped in to participate, contributing $7 million to the round.The other notable deal in the segment last year was a big $10 million Series A round raised by Medwell Ventures from Fidelity Growth Partners India and Fidelity Biosciences.It isnt entirely surprising to see the heightened interest in the healthcare sector. Mint reported in March, quoting a Deloitte research report, that Indias overall healthcare market is worth $100 billion and is expected to grow at a 23% compounded annual growth rate to touch $280 billion by 2020. The report further estimates that the market for pharma e-commerce alone will grow 10 times to $400 million by 2017.The healthcare sector has also had a good run at the bourses lately, reigniting interest among investors. Last year, diagnostics services chain Dr Lal PathLabss public offering, which was subscribed more than 33 times, created profitable exits for its two private equity investorsWestBridge Capital Partners and TA Associates. Other successful public market outings include Narayana Hrudayalaya, which runs a chain of multispeciality hospitals, in December, and diagnostics labs chain Thyrocare Technologies Ltd last month. Thyrocares investors include CX Partners, Norwest Venture Partners and Samara Capital.Healthcare should be on the radar of investors, both early and later stage. Its one of those sectors that holds the key to solving massive problems in this country and offers multiple opportunities for non-linear growth. Investors just have to be careful that healthcare doesnt go the food technology way. The after-effects would be disastrous.",2016-05-27,4Yswe3cNQbyVZh3oU0dwuK,"Since March, investors have concluded around 17 deals that have something or the other to do with healthcare

This deposit could be made with any banks. But now cooperative banks have been barred from accepting such deposits. The PMGKY scheme is open till 31 March. Application for the deposit in the form of bonds ledger account shall be received by any banking company, other than cooperative banks, to which the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, applies, the government said while amending the notification for PMGKY, 2016.

0.25,"Ahead of his World Chess Championship (11-30 November) match against challenger Sergey Karjakin in November, defending champion Magnus Carlsen contacted Microsoft Corp. Its not that he wanted Office installed on his laptop, but he was simply seeking help to prevent hacking.
				   
				Carlsen, who relies heavily on specialised chess computers for his preparation, was worried that Russian hackers would gain access to his tactics which, in turn, could help Crimean-born Karjakin, reported The Indian Express. His fears stemmed from precedence: Russia-based hackers had broken into the World Anti-Doping Agencys website sometime back.Technology is now integral to sportand not just in malpractices like the one cited above (Carlsen retained his title). Technology is used in training, diet, recovery, clothes, shoes and in every sphere of the modern sporting world. In speed skating, an academic paper World Records: How much athlete? How much technology? suggests that half of the progress of world records has been due to changes in technologyand the other half from real athletic improvement.Three key areas have been consistently in prominence: first, the use of technology in officiating or umpiring; second, in data analysis; and third, in safety. All three play a role in driving sporting excellence and, more importantly, particularly in the world of sport, driving fans experience. It can be argued that too much reliance on science or numbers removes the element of instinct from sportone which allows M.S. Dhoni to promote himself in a World Cup cricket final or tells Stan Wawrinka to hit that backhand in the 2015 French Open tennis final. But when millimetres and fractions of seconds decide the difference between winner and runner-up, any help becomes welcome in the high intensity, competitive world of modern sport. Heres a look at how technology makes a mark in these three facets of sport.Not just line callsIn the first Test match against England in November, India were 208-1 with Cheteshwar Pujara batting on 86 when a ball bowled by Zafar Ansari hit the batsman on his leg. The umpire gave him out but Pujara, playing at home in Rajkot, asked for a review.The reconsideration decided the ball was going over the stumps and the umpires decision was revised. As the crowd roared, Pujaras wife did a little jig in the stands and two men sitting across Pujaras father shook hands, the commentator paid due credit: Thank you ICC and DRS.The Board of Control for Cricket in India has for long opposed the decision review system (DRS), citing inaccuracies in its methodology, but agreed to it on a trial basis for the five-Test series. But if a replay benefited Pujara (he went on to score a century in the first innings) it has benefited several others, too.Video replays have been used in many sports besides crickettennis, rugby, baseball and basketball, to name a fewfor different purposes. In basketball, it can be used to find out if the shot was released before the final buzzer, in baseball to handle boundary calls and in tennis/badminton whether the ball/shuttle landed inside or outside the lines. British firm Hawk-Eye, which has developed systems for many sports, uses 6-7 cameras to record the balls trajectory in tennis and puts together a three-dimensional image for officials to decide if the ball is in.Footballs governing body FIFA tried GoalControl technology during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The German-produced tech used 14 high-speed cameras and sensors mounted around the stadiumseven pointed at each goalto detect whether the ball has crossed the goal line or not. They could also combine their data into a three-dimensional format and send visual or vibration signals to the referees watch. A British firm Small Fry developed shin guards equipped with accelerometers and magnetic sensors that could reduce the number of dives in a football match. This could rob the sleep of players such as Chelseas Diego Costa.The Guardian reported other similar tools sometime back: Cairos Technologies and Adidas producing a system that uses a magnetic field to track the ball using a sensor embedded inside the ball, which detects the magnetic field produced by thin wires underneath the penalty box. Goalminder technology uses high-speed cameras built into the goal posts and crossbar to deliver visual evidence; GoalRef uses a magnetic field-based technology, too, but here the goal frame detects the passing of the ball.The International Football Association Board (IFAB) also approved testing of video technology to aid match officials (a final decision is to be taken later). The trials will allow referees to call on video assistance to help determine four categories of game-changing moments: goals scored, red cards, penalties and mistaken identity, AFP reported in March.In international sport, the stakes are very high. For instance, in the Olympics that are held once in four years, an athlete may not get a second shot at it since sporting careers tend to be brief, making margins of errors career-defining.So when Bahamas Shaunae Miller divedor fell as some have arguedat the end of the womens 400-metre race at the Rio Olympic Games in August, she lay on the track breathless for some time, as the result of the race remained unclear. It emerged later that she had beaten the favourite, Allyson Felix of the USA, to win the gold medal. The margin of victory: 0.07 seconds. The decision made by: Technology.Numbers tell how good you areOne of the best examples of using data comes from baseball, in which Oakland Athletics manager Billy Beane partnered a Yale graduate in crunching numbers and building a low-budget team of winnersimmortalized in the book Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game and a Hollywood movie. That was over a decade ago.Since then, innovations like Major League Baseballs Statcast and the National Basketball Associations SportVU systemsa system of six cameras in each arena that measures the movements of the ball and every player on the court, generating an entire database of performance informationhave leveraged data to assist coaches and players. Teams in the National Basketball Association, such as the San Antonio Spurs, have similarly used Big Data sets to help owners and coaches recruit players and execute game plans, according to the Stanford Graduate School of Business.A hand-held device called Skulpt helps improve trainingits 12 sensors, when pressed against the skin, create electric current that measures the percentage of muscle fibre versus fat stored inside the muscle. EliteForm is a technology that tracks and analyses an athletes movements while training and during games, the CNN listed in February.Niall Clark, who is the head of performance at Sachin Tendulkar co-owned Kerala Blasters, the football team in the Indian Super League, says they rely heavily on heart rate monitors and GPS. The players are given intense amount of work on certain days so they can hit specific heart rate zones and 60-70% of their individual heart rate for a maximum of 20 minutesfor recovery of homeostasis balance. GPS helps find out how much distance a player has covered, sprints he has made, accelerations and decelerationdata that help find out how the hamstring is working.GPS has also helped find that midfielders, for example, travel farther but accelerated less than players in other positions. If there is a big jump from one to other morning in the resting heart rate, we know something is wrong. Saliva helps with hormone levels, blood levels, to gauge player fitness. We havent had any muscle injuries in the season; contact injuriesyou cannot do anything about, says Clark.In certain other places, filming an athlete to gauge form and errors is passé now. Newer three-dimensional motion capture technologylike the Xbox Kinect systemsand biometric feedback on heart and respiratory rates, can give far more information, SportTechie reported.Another device, Motionize, that sends real-time information directly to an app, is a virtual coach for canoeists and kayakers. It uses two sensors, one on the boat and one on the paddle, and displays a complete view of the athletes movements on the cellphone screen.Cricket, a sport heavily influenced by statistics and datafor both performers and fansis not far behind either. Firms like CricHQwhich has the expertise of former New Zealand cricketers Stephen Fleming and Brendon McCullumCricket 21 and SportsMechanics, a sports analytics firm, crunch numbers for teams.CricHQ, which is working in conjunction with Callaghan Innovation to build the worlds best match projection engine, claims to be able to predict with a confidence interval of approximately 75% the result of any fixture in the IPL (using previous IPL data). Confidence interval is a range in which a measurement or trial falls corresponding to a given probability. We are looking to expose this engine for the 2017 IPL and hope to provide a unique experience for customers and consumers alike, says David Robertson, the companys chief data officer.Wear it, bear it for safetyIn November 2014, Australian cricketer Phil Hughes was struck by a ball on the back of his neck while batting during a first-class game. He collapsed on the pitch and died two days later. But strange as that incident may seem, it was not isolated.In recent times, at least three other people have succumbed to injuries on the cricket field: in November the same year, an Israeli umpire died after being struck on the jaw by a ball; in April 2015 a 20-year-old club cricketer died after colliding with another player in Kolkata and in July, another in England died after being struck on the chest while batting. International cricketers like Joe Root, Craig Kieswetter and Stuart Broad have suffered impact injuries in recent times, highlighting the need for on-field safety. During the same Rajkot Test, Pujara was struck thrice on his helmet.The ill-effect of force is not uniqueauthor Jeanne Marie Laskas wrote about a pathologist, Dr Bennet Omalu, who discovered that American footballers could suffer from mental deterioration caused by blows to the head. It was made into a movie last year, Concussion.NFL moved on to smart helmets, which have sensor and magnet technologysensors detect and disperse the force of collisions, while the magnet will help by spreading and absorbing the force.Since the Hughes incident and even before that, cricket has taken corrective measures, as the International Cricket Council brought in new regulations. Helmets now have a stem guard, made of thermoplastic polyurethane, to shield the back of the head and neck. It is a clip-on attachment to the side of the grille, with enhanced impact absorption, reported espncricinfo.com early this year.Over the years, other sports have modified their methods for the sake of safer practices.

0.42,"San Francisco:  Elon Musk showcased his ambitions to make Tesla Motors Inc. a clean-energy behemoth on Friday, unveiling a new solar-roof product at an evening event at Universal Studios in Los Angeles, California.
				   
				As the sun set, Musk told hundreds of guests gathered outside that Tesla and SolarCity Corp., the company that he chairs and which he aims to acquire, will make solar roofs that look better than normal roofs. He then showcased several houses with different roofing styles and said they were all solar, with solar panels embedded into glass shingles.How do we have a solar roof that is better than a normal roof, looks better, last longer, said Musk. You want to pull your neighbours over and say Check out this sweet roof.Musks presentation was short on details about the efficiency of the solar roofs, their warranty, cost or when they will be available. The solar roof is offered in four styles: Textured Glass Tile, Slate Glass Tile, Tuscan Glass Tile, and Smooth Glass Tile  due to a variety of architectural styles.Home batteriesThe idea is that homeowners will generate electricity for their home with solar power, then store that electricity in a home battery known as a Powerwall. You can fill up your battery during the day, then discharge it at night when the sun sets.Musk and Tesla chief technology officer JB Straubel have long envisioned a clean-energy future of electric cars powered by an increasingly solar grid, with Teslas batteries optimizing both. The company also offers much larger Powerpack systems to commercial and utility customers and has deployed almost 300 megawatt hours in 18 countries to date, according to a blog post on Thursday.Battery-based energy storage has the potential to revolutionize electricity for the worlds poorest citizens the way mobile technology disrupted the telecommunications industry. Coupled with solar panels or wind turbines, powerful lithium-ion batteries can store energy and provide electricity for the roughly 1.3 billion people worldwide who dont have access to electricity and face whats called energy poverty.Fridays event is part of concerted effort to make the case for the SolarCity acquisition to investors. More details, including financial information, will be revealed 1 November, when the company has said it plans to create a clear picture of how a combined Tesla and SolarCity will make solar and storage as compelling as electric vehicles. The proposed merger has been controversial because Musk is the chairman and largest financier of SolarCity, and the boards of both companies are deeply intertwined. Shareholders are to vote on the proposed merger 17 November.

0.54,"Beijing: China is seeking to build up export markets for its power amid signs the nation has invested too much in new generation plants.
				   
				State Grid Corp. of China, which runs the majority of the nations electricity distribution network, is considering how to build links to India, South Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia, a move that would require billions of dollars of investment in long-distance, high-voltage power lines.Interconnections would allow grid managers throughout the region to more flexibility use variable supplies coming from wind and solar farms cropping up from Vietnam to Mongolia. For China, the links would provide customers for power from hundreds of power plants finished in the past few years as demand in its domestic market stagnates.We can export to India and Southeast Asia where the power supply is inadequate, Zhang Qiping, chief engineer of State Grid, said on Tuesday at a conference hosted by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) in Shanghai.China, which is the worlds biggest investor in fossil-fuel generation, started more than 70 gigawatts of new coal projects last year and had 200 gigawatts under construction at the end of April, the Paris-based International Energy Agency said in September. At the same time, most plants are sitting idle more than half the time, and low-carbon sources of electricity including nuclear and renewables are covering additional demand.That report added weight to concerns voiced by environmental groups such as Greenpeace that China is apt to waste 1 trillion yuan ($148 billion) on excess power capacity by 2020.At the BNEF conference in Shanghai, energy policymakers from China, Thailand and Mongolia spoke about the merits of building a regional network of power interconnections, which would help reduce the cost of electricity and make grids more flexible in dealing with renewables. The issue is biggest for China, which has the largest power network in the region.Asia will be an important part in the global energy interconnection, Wang Min, vice general manager at State Grid, said at the BNEF meeting. The region, he said, has the biggest potential in energy economic growth and is a region with the most and fast-growing energy demand.Shift indicatedThe remarks at the BNEF conference are the fullest indication yet that the bid for interconnections has backing from the Chinese government. Wang said the effort fits with president Xi Jinpings effort launched in September 2015 to reduce pollution in Chinas power utility industry, part of the nations commitment with the US to hold back greenhouse gases damaging the climate.Regional interconnections will help each nation achieve targets to cap carbon emissions under the United Nations climate deal agreed in Paris last year, said Yao Qiang, vice general manager of Power Construction Corp. of China Ltd. The effort to replace fossil fuels with renewables is an unstoppable trend, he said.Also Read: China steel behemoth gets finishing touchesSignals pointing toward the priority that China places on inter-connectors emerged in March. Then, State Grid joined Tokyo-based wireless carrier SoftBank Group Corp., Korea Electric Power Corp. and Russian grid company Rosseti Pjsc in agreeing to research and plan for interconnected power grids in Northeast Asia as part of a plan dubbed Asia Super Grid.State Grids Wang has also proposed an ultra-high-voltage global power network to transmit electricity from country to country and continent to continent, with costs estimated at $50 trillion to develop by 2050.Other stepsTheres indications that more nations in the region are sympathetic to Chinas effort program.There are lots of engineering challenges, Michael Liebreich, founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said on a panel discussion about the issue at the event in Shanghai. The longer distance youre moving the power, the more exposed to interruption and catastrophic implications. These are issues that need to be addressed,For China, interconnections would combine smart grids, ultra-high voltage and clean energy, said Wang Yimin, who is currently the secretary general of the Global Energy Interconnection Development & Cooperation Organization. Created in March, Wangs organization is designed to promote links throughout the region.Its doable in technology, said Wang, adding current ultra-high voltage lines can transmit as much as 15 gigawatts of power through 5,000 kilometers.The organization is planning to draft a plan by the end of this year for transmitting power from East China to South Korea and then to Japan, Wang said.

The business has been renamed Clix Capital. In an interview, Bhasin talks about the gameplan ahead. Edited excerpts:
Whats your view on the current scenario of demonetisation? Will it be beneficial for lenders?Its a real concern for the short term as growth will slow down, borrowing will slow down and payments will slow down. We are fortunate as we are not fully in the game yet. I can see shops being hurt, consumer sales dip, which no one could be prepared for. The next couple of quarters might be really painful. However, it will allow everyone to participate in the economy in the medium and long term and the entire push towards digitization will be very good for us and the economy. Ultimately, it could also drive cultural change against black money and really double and treble the taxpayer base. The overall long-term result could be very positive.If you look around the world, India is one of the most attractive places to do business anywhere in the world, and especially in financial services, the growth prospects are goodas long as we remain disciplined about risk management.You closed the GE Capital India buyout recently. What are the growth plans?We closed the acquisition two months ago. We have assets of $300 million which will be used as a base to expand business. We have identified three major segments for businessconsumer, SME (small and medium enterprise) lending and commercial/corporate lending. Within that, there are multiple segmentsconsumer durables, used car loans, personal loans, education loans, school loansin the consumer space. We may plan housing finance in future. The size of lending could be anywhere between Rs10,000 to Rs50-70 crore depending on the segment. Our firm was renamed as Clix Capital a month ago and all regulatory approvals are in place.What role do you expect to play in the area of technology where you have expertise as the founder of Genpact?We strongly believe that technology platforms, especially those focused on mobile technology, will be a key differentiator for us. We will also add very strong analytical capability, leveraging my prior experience as the founder of Genpact, where we built one of the largest analytics capabilities in India. While there are many fintech companies that are coming up, many struggle because of lack of funding and strong underwriting capabilities. We still have separate worlds between banks and financial services companies, many of whom are carrying legacy systems, and technology companies which are trying to go beyond just their technology platform.At Clix, we want to build the best hybrid financial and technology solution to take our products to customers in a unique manner, which delivers speed, convenience, backed by strong underwriting.Acquisitions are common in the non-banking financial company spaceseveral smaller buyouts took place recently.We will certainly expand business through acquisitionswhether loan portfolios, or smaller NBFCs or aggregating platforms. There are many interesting opportunities and platforms and we would keep looking and evaluating options. Right now, we want to focus most on building our businesses. Our major challenge is hiring talented people. We want to build a fantastic team, taking the best of GE and adding modern-day innovation and creativity and design thinking.What are the challenges for NBFCs in India?NBFCs have grown fast. High-quality companies have grown and opportunities in India are large. We have great success stories. The way wealth has been created, for example, in Kotak Bank, Bajaj, Induslnd and other private banks, is a fantastic story. Having said that, risk management remains a key issue.In future, we will see competition from Amazon, Paytm and many other non-traditional players in this lending space.

				The government on 8 November demonetized Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes in a step to curb black money. Following the move, banks were closed on 9 November to stock lower value notes and exchange the defunct ones. In the last three days of working, nearly Rs30,000 crore cash has been disbursed in currency notes of lower denominations and newly introduced Rs2,000 notes. The ATMs are being recalibrated to handle new Rs500 and Rs2,000 notes, Indian Banks Association (IBA) said in a statement. From 10 November, customers are allowed to exchange up to Rs4,000 in cash at any bank branch with valid identity proof. They can also withdraw cash against withdrawal slip or cheque, subject to ceiling of Rs10,000 a day, within an overall limit of Rs20,000 in a week (including withdrawals from ATMs) up to 24 November, after which these limits shall be reviewed. IBA said the banks are making all-out efforts to ensure currency requirements of customers are met within the limits prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India. It, however, appealed to the public to use alternative modes of payments like debit and credit cards. In addition, payments could be made through electronic channels like RTGS (real-time gross settlement systems), NEFT (national electronic funds transfer), IMPS (immediate payment service), net banking, UPI (unified payments interface).

0.35,"Mumbai: The governments decision to withdraw Rs500 and Rs1,000 currency notes is likely to cause havoc in the automated teller machine (ATM) ecosystem as manufacturers get ready to adjust to new norms.
				   
				The process of ensuring there are enough currency notes in any given machine is also going to be a costly exercise for banks as they will have to ensure that there is enough legal tender available in the market.In any ATM, there are four currency containers, known as cassettes, which can contain 2,500 individual currency notes each. So, in total, an ATM can only have a maximum of 10,000 currency notes at any given time. Each cassette can only contain one type of currency note. How many Rs.100, Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes are loaded in a machine is dependent on the location of the ATM and the number of transactions that happen.Typically though, an ATM will not be loaded with over Rs.25-30 lakh in currency notes, since idle money would be a waste for the banks.For ATM manufacturers, the most important thing to do now is to replace all Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 cassettes and replace them with Rs.100 and the new high-security Rs.500 and Rs.2,000 notes over the next two days, as the machines will start operations only on Friday (11 November).New high-security Rs.500 and Rs.2,000 currency notes will be available in ATMs from 11 November, said finance secretary Ashok Lavasa on Wednesday, reported PTI.

0.66,"New Delhi: The fine print of Union budget 2017-18 has served incentives for the energy sector such as lowering the tax burden on carbon trading gains and making it more attractive for foreign oil firms to store crude oil in Indias strategic reserves. 
				   
				The incentives seek to support energy security and climate change goals of the country after having decisively departed from petroleum subsidies.Union finance minister Arun Jaitley has proposed to cut the tax on gains from carbon trading to 10% from 30% in a move expected to make investments into energy efficiency and clean energy more rewarding. The minister also extended the income tax exemption to foreign companies storing crude oil in Indias strategic reserves to any gains from sale of such oil even after expiry of the companys contract with the Indian government. At the moment, this benefit is limited only during the contract period.The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) set up under the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) allows investors in emission-reducing projects to generate tradable credits corresponding to the volume of emission reduction achieved. These credits can be sold to industrialized countries. So far, the income tax department has been treating the income on transfer of carbon credits as business income, subject to a 30% tax. Jaitley has proposed that it shall be a concessional 10% and applicable surcharge and cess. This amendment will take effect from the 2017-18 financial year.The move to incentivize clean energy projects comes parallelly with gradual increase in taxes on petroleum products and the cess on coal, making India one of the leaders in climate change action. Since June 2014, when international oil prices started declining, India has increased excise duty on branded petrol from Rs15.5 a litre to Rs22.7 a litre as of December 2016 and on branded diesel from Rs5.8 a litre to Rs19.7 a litre, pointed out the Economic Survey 2016-17.In contrast, the governments of most advanced countries have simply passed on the benefits to consumers, setting back the cause of curbing climate change. As a result, India now outperforms all the countries except those in Europe in terms of tax on petroleum and diesel, the survey pointed out.Ashish Khanna, chief executive officer of Tata Power Solar Systems Ltd, said the budget demonstrated the governments commitment to being a front runner in renewable sources of energy.In line with the governments stated objective of phasing out corporate tax exemptions in order to be able to moderate the corporate tax rate from 30% to 25%, Jaitley did not extend the income tax incentive for power projects under section 80 IA after it expires on 31 March 2017.

Consider the ordinary wooden cupboard which opens up to Narnia in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; or platform 9¾ of Londons Kings Cross station, the secret entrance to board a train to Hogwarts in the Harry Potter series; or the town of Macondo in One Hundred Years of Solitude, where the surreal is the normal.
				   
				The success of Pokémon Go is also in the realm of magical realismas augmented reality brings magical pocket monsters to our real world.It is no secret that the Pokémon Go craze has swept across the world. It has players in the US, Australia, New Zealand and major parts of Europe hooked. Terms such as PokéStops, Pokémon gyms and Pokéballs have already become common parlance.The first home video game consolea device that outputs a video signal or visual image to display a video gamewas manufactured as early as 1972, much before the days of Nintendos Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda. This bulky ensemble of a black, white and brown box called the Odyssey, manufactured by Magnavox, pales in comparison to the sophisticated modern-day versions of Sonys PlayStation and Microsofts Xbox. Nevertheless, it marked the beginning of a new mode of entertainment.Today, according to statistics published by the Entertainment Software Association, a majority of frequent gamers find that consoles hold more value for money than DVDs, movies and music. Four out of five US households own a device used to play video games with the average age of a player being 35 years.Thus, it is not surprising that Pokémon Go did well in a region which has been addicted to gaming for decades. Augmented reality via a smartphone as opposed to the virtual world created within the confines of homes by consoles offers something of a fresh perspective to the ordinarily sedentary gamer. It lets an individual walk about his locality, represented by an avatar guided by his phones GPS, and catch, train and battle with virtual creatures superimposed on the real world. Even if one accounts for the incidents of falling off cliffs and mugging, or the claims that video games decrease the grey area of the brain, the game has a charm to it and an unreal one at that.The video game mania of the modern-day world is not however, restricted to its fetish for the unreal. It is also the huge level of self-actualization and gratification that a gamer feels when he catches them all as the catch phrase for any Pokémon game reminds us. Within the human brain is the reward system which is responsible for desire, pleasure and positive reinforcement. When rewardedsay with virtual monsters or other awardsthe brain releases a compound called dopamine which encodes information about the salience, value, and context of a reward. This reward system is the one which induces appetitive or consummatory behaviour. Psychological theories like operant conditioning say that the frequency of a behaviour will increase if rewarded and decrease if penalized. Other theories such as the one given by Wolfram Schultz propounds that unexpected rewards or rewards greater than expected can also increase dopamine levels.The most popular video games of the past few years such as Diablo and World of Warcraft have been known to capitalize on this reward-seeking mentality of the human brain. Pokémon Go provides all the key ingredients responsible for activating the reward systemgratification, fast pace and unpredictability. The key towards maintaining the public interest in the game in future will also lie in these very ingredients.Meanwhile, another gameto monetize Pokémon Gois already emerging in the backdrop. Ad agencies are already neck-deep in research to find out ways to lure customers to nearby shops and restaurants from PokéStops. According to an article in the Financial Times, Niantics previous release Ingress which also involved virtual portals mapped on streets had found good commercial footing owing to the willingness of retailers and service providers to pay for promotions in the game. Pokémon Go too shows similar, if not higher potential. The trick is to reap the benefits before the crescendo dies.

				We propose to create an integrated public sector oil major which will be able to match the performance of international and domestic private sector oil and gas companies, said Jaitley in his budget speech.International firms such as ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell plc and BP Plc have integrated operations across upstream exploration, refining and fuel retail.The Indian governments move comes in the backdrop of concerns articulated over rising oil prices presenting a challenge to the countrys growth. The price of crude oil in the Indian energy basket has increased from $39.9 in April 2016 to $52.7 in December 2016.The Indian energy basket represents the average of Oman, Dubai and Brent crude. The price was $54.63 per barrel on Friday.The state-owned firms in the oil and gas sector are; Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC), Oil India Ltd, GAIL (India) Ltd, Indian Oil Corp., Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Numaligarh Refinery Ltd, Chennai Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Engineers India Ltd,  Balmer Lawrie & Co. Ltd, and Biecco Lawrie Co. Ltd.We see opportunities to strengthen our CPSEs (central public sector enterprises) through consolidation, mergers and acquisitions. By these methods, the CPSEs can be integrated across the value chain of an industry. It will give them capacity to bear higher risks, avail economies of scale, take higher investment decisions and create more value for the stakeholders. Possibilities of such restructuring are visible in the oil and gas sector, Jaitley said.The concern over crude oil prices stems from Indias energy import bill of around $150 billion, expected to reach $300 billion by 2030. India imports around 80% of its crude oil and 18% of its natural gas requirements. India imported 202 million tonnes of oil in 2015-16.The state owned firms welcomed the move.Though the finer details are yet to come but the intention appears to form an integrated company on the lines of integrated oil firms such as ExxonMobil, Shell and BP, said Dinesh K. Sarraf, chairman and managing director, ONGC.This also comes at a time of faltering domestic crude oil and gas production and output cuts announced by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec). India is one of the major consumers of Opecs production, with the grouping accounting for 85% and 94% of Indias crude oil and gas imports.Indias energy demand growth is expected to outpace the other BRIC (Brazil, Russia, China, India) countries, according to the latest BP Energy Outlook released last week.The new entity will have economies of scale and Indian industrys negotiating power globally will increase significantly.

Its Ebitda of Rs515.8 crore was much higher than the Streets estimates. For instance, Kotak Institutional Equities and Edelweiss Securities Ltd were expecting the Ebitda at Rs430 crore. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.ALSO READ | Zee Entertainments profit up 8.6% at Rs250.8 croreA decline in costs led to this improvement, as overall revenue growth was just 3.4% compared to a year ago.

In comparison, it had increased 15.7% and 19%, respectively, in the September and June quarters.According to the company, advertising revenue growth during the first 40 days of the quarter, i.e. pre-demonetisation, was similar to the growth seen in the half year ended September. What offers some comfort is that Zee Entertainments December quarter ad revenue performance was better than some analysts expectations. For instance, Kotak and Edelweiss were expecting ad revenue growth of 2% and 1%, respectively.Subscription revenue, accounting for 36% of total revenue, increased 13.7%, helped by closure of content deals with a few large distribution platform operators during the quarter. Subscription revenue included some catch-up revenues for the previous quarters. After a good quarter, much depends on how advertising shapes up. According to Mihir Modi, chief finance and strategy officer at Zee Entertainment, while advertising growth is better than November and December, it hasnt gone back to pre-demonetisation days.For the next six-eight months, Modi expects telecom and auto sectors to give impetus to advertising growth.

				Separately, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) will use the CBI chargesheet against Kingfisher Airlines, its officials and IDBI Bank officials to file a fresh extradition plea for Vijay Mallya, a senior official of the investigative agency said on condition of anonymity. A significant portion of the loans was disbursed by the bank was remitted out of India, said CBI in its 2,000-page chargesheet filed on 24 January. The chargesheet, a part of which was reviewed by Mint, names five retired IDBI bankers, four Kingfisher Airlines officials and Mallya, whom it called an absconder.Mallya-IDBI Bank CMD holiday meeting led to hasty sanction of Rs350 crore: EDThe CBI has already asked seven countries including the US, UK, Ireland, Mauritius and Switzerland  to conduct investigations in their respective jurisdictions and provide documentary evidence. CBI said it has so far unearthed a trail of Rs263 crore which it believes was diverted. CBIs investigation found that risk norms were flouted in sanctioning a short-term advance of Rs150 crore in addition to the Rs950 crore loan. It is relevant to mention here that the proposal was referred for credit rating almost a week after the disbursement of the entire loan amount, said the chargesheet. ED also plans to re-initiate the process of bringing Mallya back to India. The businessman left India in early March for the UK as creditors owed in excess of Rs9,000 crore by Kingfisher Airlines closed in on him.CBI charges Vijay Mallya with fraud, criminal conspiracyED will make a second attempt to bring Vijay Mallya to India.

MLAT is a bilateral agreement to share information in an ongoing investigation.ED is also investigating whether bankers received any kickbacks in the IDBI case. The BJP and Congress on Monday traded charges over help extended to Vijay Mallya in securing loans and leaving the country, with the two parties hurling accusations at each other for coming to the aid of the beleaguered businessman. Ahead of the budget session beginning on Tuesday, the BJP sought to corner Congress, alleging the corrupt hands which helped Mallya secure bank loans belonged to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and finance minister P.Chidambaram.Vijay Mallya issue: Manmohan Singh, P. Chidambaram deny BJPs allegationsSingh and Chidambaram rejected the charge, and the Congress targeted the Modi government over allowing the former liquor baron to leave for foreign shores. BJP spokesman Sambit Patra quoted from purported letters written by Mallya to Singh seeking his intervention to bail out KFA, following which it got loans. Singh  told the media that it was routine for businessmen to write letters to the government which were marked to appropriate authorities and that they did not violate any law. I think what I have done was done with full satisfaction of mind that we were not doing anything which was against law of the land.Patra cited another letter the liquor baron, who has been declared a proclaimed offender by a court, allegedly wrote to Chidambaram in March 2013, seeking his intervention to get a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from State Bank of India when his liquor company United Spirits Ltd was in talks with Diageo Plc. over a deal. Mint couldnt ascertain the context of that letter, but SBI heads the consortium that loaned money to KFA.The letter does not concern Kingfisher, it concerns United Spirits Limited, which was and is a thriving, flourishing profitable company. The letter does not talk about any loan, the letter talks about an NOC for a preferential allotment of shares. That is capital, equity, not loans, Chidambaram told reporters.  Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala posed a string of questions to BJP, asking the ruling party to explain who was responsible for allowing Mallya to leave India at a time when the consortium of lenders were moving against him.  Why has Modi Government not sought deportation of Vijay Mallya from UK till today? Surjewala asked.

-0.68,"New York/Frankfurt: Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $630 million in fines to US and UK regulators for failing to prevent around $10 billion in suspicious trades being laundered out of Russia, settling a second major legal case this month.
				   
				The scheme involved so-called mirror trades between the banks Moscow, London and New York offices from 2011 to 2015, in which it bought Russian blue-chip stocks in roubles on behalf of clients and sold the identical quantity of the same stocks at the same price through its London branch shortly afterwards.The offsetting trades here lacked economic purpose and could have been used to facilitate money laundering or enable other illicit conduct, the New York Department of Financial Services said, which fined Deutsche Bank $425 million.The bank missed numerous opportunities to detect, investigate and stop the scheme due to extensive compliance failures, allowing the scheme to continue for years.Britains Financial Conduct Authority separately fined Deutsche Bank £163 million ($204 million) for failing to maintain an adequate anti-money laundering controls between 2012 and 2015, allowing customers to transfer billions from Russia to offshore bank accounts in a manner that is highly suggestive of financial crime.It is the largest financial penalty for anti money-laundering controls failings yet imposed by the FCA or its predecessor, the Financial Services Authority.The Russian case settlements, on the heels of a $7.2 billion agreement with the US Department of Justice earlier this month over the misselling of mortgage-backed securities, lift much of the uncertainty swirling around the bank over its exposure to fines and enforcement.Deutsche Bank said the Russia-related settlement amounts were materially reflected in existing litigation reserves. It added, however, it was still cooperating with other regulators and authorities who had their own ongoing investigations.Its shares rose 1.5% to the top of Germanys blue-chip index at 18.88 in early trade.The US Department of Justice, which also has been investigating the suspicious trades, is not party to the deal. A spokesman for the department declined to comment on the status of its probe.Reuters reported earlier that Deutsche Bank was poised to settle over the trades.The New York regulator, which licenses and supervises the New York branch, found Deutsche Bank conducted its business in an unsafe and unsound manner in violation of state banking law.The trade of a Russian blue chip stock, typically valued at between $2 million to $3 million an order, was cleared through the banks New York operations, with the sellers typically paying in US dollars, DFS said.In addition to the penalty, Deutsche is required to retain an independent monitor to review the banks compliance programs.Deutsche Bank disclosed last September that it had taken disciplinary measures against certain employees as part of an investigation of the trades and would continue to do so. It also cut back on its investment banking activities in Russia.Mondays consent order found Deutsche Banks Moscow traders facilitated the scheme, with most of the trades placed by a single trader representing both sides of the transaction.Deutsches Moscow traders did not question the suspicious trades because it made for easy commissions when their Russian business had slowed, the regulator found.The bank is due to report fourth-quarter financial results on Thursday.",2017-01-31,5vFXMqqMbbz8bVVoCXCosL,"The scheme involved so-called mirror trades between the Deutsche Banks Moscow, London and New York offices from 2011 to 2015",18:09,Deutsche Bank fined $630 million for failures over Russian money-laundering
0.15,"There are enough dirges being sung for public sector banks, but strangely the performance of their stocks after their quarterly results does not reflect this. 
				   
				Five out of the seven public sector banks that reported quarterly results on Friday made a loss and the profit-makers, State Bank of India (SBI) and Oriental Bank of Commerce, showed a worse bad loan ratio. But their shares surged, with SBI rising more than 7%, and Bank of India gaining over 10%. Here are a few reasons why investors believe theres value in bank stocks, despite the rash of bad loans.Falling rate of slippages: This is one of the clearest signs that public sector banks are getting a grip on the bad loan problem. Lenders labelled a massive Rs.1.5 trillion worth of loans as non-performing in the March quarter. In the June quarter, the addition has come down to Rs.50,000 crore. This is something investors are cheering.Provisions: Banks have provided for most of the big troubled accounts in the March quarter, courtesy the Reserve Bank of Indias asset quality review. Provisions have halved for the 25 public sector lenders in the June quarter. Sure, some more skeletons may tumble out of the cupboard. But these are unlikely to be of the magnitude of provisions made in the March quarter. What do lower provisions mean? Higher profits, of course.Retail loan growth: Barring big banks such as SBI and Bank of Baroda, public sector lenders were slow to wake up to Indias consumption story. But now, every public sector bank has announced its plan to focus on retail lending. Rising retail consumption, which is fuelled by personal loans, could well pull them out of their credit abyss. Retail loan growth at Bank of India was 13%, at Union Bank of India 14% and that at SBI 20% in the June quarter.Merge or perish: For the public sector lenders to survive, some will have to die. The government is more open now than before for consolidation that would create a handful of strong and valuable lenders. A start is the merger of its associates with SBI. It will be tricky to forecast a turnaround in the fortunes of banks, although some bankers say this could happen in the first quarter of 2017-18.  Barring SBI, all public sector lenders have a price-to-book value ratio of below one. Until the dust settles, these rock-bottom valuations will keep calling to investors.",2016-08-15,5yRFwAXonxqCjpTtnGYJxN,"To foretell the timing of the turnaround of the public sector banks is tricky, although bankers insist that this would happen as early as the first quarter of FY18

-0.09,"Over the past few years, several policymakers have been heard complaining that Indian firms are not investing enough. The latest data on asset sales provides a clear and stark answer for that phenomenon: the Indian economy is currently going through the biggest deleveraging of the past quarter century, if not the biggest in history.
				   
				Data sourced from Thomson Reuters Eikon show that Indian companies have sold more assets in 2016 than they have in any year since liberalization. It is no wonder then that private investments have been tepid as the deleveraging process picked up pace over the past year or so. The data shows that asset-sale deals announced, pending or completed in 2016 are worth $40.85 billion. This beats the previous peak of $27.96 billion announced in 2007 by a wide margin. The Reuters data covers any tangible asset, branch, division, operations or subsidiary sold off by a parent firm.While the previous peak was driven by demand from investors who wanted a stake in the India growth story, the current round of asset sales has been driven largely by distress of indebted corporations. Essar features in the list of top deals in both 2007 and 2016. The top deals in 2007 include Vodafones acquisition of Hutchison Essar and Matsushita Electric Works acquisition of Anchor Electricals. The top deals of 2016 include the sale of controlling stake in Essar Oil to PJSC Rosneft Oil Co by the heavily indebted Essar group, and UltraTech Cement Ltds acquisition of Jaypee Groups cement assets. However, in terms of completed deals, 2016 has seen lower amount of such deals compared to previous years but that is largely because many of the asset sales are yet to receive regulatory approvals.As the charts below show, the asset sales have been led by stressed firms in the debt-laden sectors of the Indian economy such as energy, real estate, and metals. Many of the leading firms in these sectors are owned by some of the most indebted corporate groups of the country.The debt overhang of Indias corporate sector has been many years in the making and the unwinding of debt is taking almost as much time as the accumulation of debt. The seeds of the current debt problems were sown during the effervescent lending of the boom years in the mid-2000s. The credit boom leading up to the great global financial crash of 2008 witnessed a dilution of lending norms by banks and an aggressive asset-buying spree by Indian corporations. The financial crash brought an end to such excesses, and the boom turned to bust. In a 2012 report, Credit Suisse pointed out that the borrowings of the top 10 indebted conglomerates in the country (which included Essar, Reliance ADAG, Vedanta, Adani and the Jaypee group) had grown five times in the five years leading up to 2012 to Rs5.4 trillion, which equalled 13% of total bank loans.Even then, delayed recognition of bad loans by banks and regulatory forbearance by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) ensured that indebted firms and conglomerates did not face the pressures of paying back their debts that they are faced with today. In a 2015 update of their original report, Credit Suisse pointed out that the total borrowings of the top 10 indebted groups stood at Rs7.3 trillion.Thanks to tightening of norms related to restructuring of assets, and greater power provided to lenders to recover dues, promoters have been forced to consider selling distressed assets and subsidiaries to retire some of their debt. Some of the top deals of the past year feature firms owned by the top 10 indebted corporate groups and other large indebted conglomerates.But does this years asset-selling spree signal an end to Indias debt woes? Most analysts suggest that is unlikely. In fact, the debt problem has become more acute for companies which are not able to meet their interest obligations or have an interest cover less than 1. Contrary to expectations of a recovery in stressed companies, the share of debt with interest cover (IC) saw a slight increase up to 39% vs 38%. The share of chronically stressed companies also increased to 34% vs 32% QoQ, and 30% (vs 34%) debt was with loss-making companies, noted a 19 September Credit Suisse report by analysts Ashish Gupta, Kush Shah and Prashant Kumar. Bankers have pointed out that cash from many asset sales is only enough to stay out of debt trouble for a year or so. And once cash-generating assets have been sold, it could lead to fresh problems for indebted groups as the cash from the deals run out. It is likely that bankers or promoters, or more likely both, would have to take a hit in the coming quarters. A 20 September Religare Capital Markets Ltd report, which examined six steel companies to analyse their debt servicing capability, noted that EBITDA (or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) would have to triple for these companies to be able to meet their debt obligations. Given the limited upsides to EBITDA (ex-sale of non-core assets), we believe debt servicing will be possible only post a 35-40% loan haircut by banks, said the report authored by analysts Pritesh Jani, Parag Jariwala and Vikesh Mehta. The continuing spectre of further deleveraging seems to have affected risk appetite across the economy. As the chart below shows, cash levels have witnessed a rise for Indian firms after the crash of 2008 even though indebted firms have lagged others. Yet, the hangover of debt and the turning of the credit cycle seems to be deterring firms from making new investments.The tepid investment climate has affected overall demand in the economy and in turn hurt the debt-servicing capabilities of the indebted groups, analysts say.Indias debt issues will not be solved without an improvement in growth or a pick-up in demand, said V. Balasubramanian, head of equities at IDBI Mutual Fund.The problem is huge, said Balasubramanian.

-0.4,"New Delhi: Winter heating to counter a severe cold wave sweeping across north India has driven up power demand beyond what was seen in previous years, sending power distributors in the region scurrying to negotiate arrangements to prepare for contingencies.
				   
				Delhis peak power demand this winter is expected to be around 4,500-4,600 mega watt (MW), compared to around 4,125MW a year ago, according to a spokesperson for two units of BSES promoted by Reliance Infrastructure Ltd supplying power in the National Capital Region (NCR). Peak winter power demand in NCR which has steadily risen from 3,678MW in 2010, has already crossed last years winter peak. Last summer, peak demand had touched 6,188MW in the capital on 20 May, about a quarter more than the peak summer demand around the same time a year ago. Energy demand peaks in mornings and early night hours compared to the average level of supply and forms a component in the electricity tariff to the consumer. It makes sense for a consumer to keep her peak demand lower as power generation companies have to  invest in extra capacity required to service the peak demand which remains idle at other times. According to Praveer Sinha, chief executive officer and managing director at Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd, Delhi may see a rise in winter peak power demand as compared to previous years due to the persistent cold wave. We all are experiencing a dip in the temperature to the coldest minimum since 2013, which has led to the increase in demand. At Tata Power-DDL, we have made prior arrangements to meet the rising demand...We have tied up through long-term power supply, banking as well as procurement on short term though the exchange, said Sinha.ALSO READ | Indias five hottest years since 1901 came in past 15 years, IMD data showsPower banking is a barter system of supplying excess power available to a distribution company to a counterpart which can be sourced back at another season at no cost. Distribution firms serving in plains strike such deals with those in hill states where power demand is more in winter and less in summer.Besides long-term arrangements, we are also using techniques like banking and backdown to dispose of surplus power and making arrangements to get power during summer months. In case of any unforeseeable contingency, BSES discoms will buy short-term power from the exchange which is available at economical rates, said the company spokesperson. BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd will bank the surplus of around 200MW with states like Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Meghalaya. BSES Yamuna Power Ltd (BYPL) has arranged for an additional 150MW from Punjab for December and January. To reduce the night surplus, BYPL will supply around 175MW to Bihar between December and March, said the spokesperson. This year, winter came late in the north and central parts of India. Two sets of cold waves, first between 11-15 January and the second between 18-19 January led to a severe fall in temperature across many parts of north and central India. In the first spell, Delhis minimum temperature dropped to 3.4 degrees Celsius on 12 January, the lowest in January in three years. Churu in Rajasthan recorded a minimum temperature of -1.9°C, seven degrees below average, making it the coldest city in the country on 12 January.According to India Meteorological Department, another cold wave will grip the northern parts of the country in the next few days which would lead to a fall in temperature.

				But this was more than 25 years ago, when he was yet to get acquainted with wine. Today, he is the chief executive of Sula Vineyards, Indias largest producer of wine, with a 60% market share. We meet in the lobby of a hotel in New Delhi Aerocity and settle down for a chat over cappuccinos and cookies.Sula will crush more than 13,000 tonnes of grapes in 2016, up 20% from last year, according to the company. Samant says they are well on track to sell one million cases in 2016-17.We continue to be the pioneers of the Indian wine industry. Every two years or so, we come out with a new wine that nobody has produced before, says Samant. We now export to more than 25 countries and are listed on the menus of Michelin-star restaurants. It says a lot about the quality that we have sustained over time.Yet there are new, urgent challenges. Global warming and climate change are among the biggest, he says.Sustainability is the companys primary focus area todayreducing waste, reusing and recycling its topmost goals. It has recently appointed a chief sustainability officer. Every inch of the roof of our Nashik plant is covered with solar panels, says Samant. About 40% of our power consumption comes from solar energy. We want it to reach 70% in the near future.Water conservation is his next target.In April, the Maharashtra government declared drought in 27,723 of the states 43,000 villages. Scanty rainfall and erratic weather patterns in the recent past have affected Sulas production as well. We recycle every single drop of water we use. But there is a long way to go, says Samant.Sustainability is an essential but a very new concept in India, he says. In fact, India is one of the major resistors at global climate change negotiations. We have to start changing our position. We have to find a way to reach our economic goals while being sustainable. India is one of the main sufferers of global warming, says Samant.Wine is particularly susceptible to the challenges of global warming because grapes are delicate, dependent heavily on the terroir of the place where they are grown. The soil is very important. It needs to be a good mix of clay, silt and sand. If its very deep clay, it is that much harder. Wine grapes love the Mediterranean climatewarm days, cool nights, dry weather, not too much rain, says Samant. *****Samant vividly remembers tasting the first bottle of wine that Sula produced, in 2000. I was sitting with Kerry (Kerry Damskey, the master winemaker from California who helps Samant in winemaking) on the veranda of our Nashik home. Are you ready? he asked. I nodded. And then he poured. The wine was cloudy. It was unfiltered. It was the first fermentation. But it tasted amazing. It was the best white wine made in India.It was the result of painstaking work done through a decade full of indecision, wandering, research, learning and perseverance.In 1991, Samant joined Oracle in Silicon Valley as finance manager but quit two years later. For a year, he backpacked through the US, Asia and India, before returning home to Mumbai in 1994 and asking his father for a job. He refused. Rajeevs father Suresh Samant owns Samson Maritime, a maritime and oil services firm. But my father said he would support me if I did anything on my own, says Samant. My father is a first-generation entrepreneur. Entrepreneurship, therefore, is in my DNA. Samant did decide to do something on his own. What, he did not know then. It was in Nashik that Samant found his calling. His father wanted to sell some land he owned. Samant asked him not to and started experimenting with organic farming. He grew roses, tomatoes and teakwood but soon realized that the infrastructure and economics were not with me there; organic farming is labour- and cost-intensive and unless it was done on a large scale, it wouldnt be profitable. He also realized that while Nashik was a cradle for table grapes, nobody was making wine. In that moment, everything came together, he says. Samant started growing table grapes in 1995 and wine grapes in 1996-97. The first crush was done in 1999.  Sula was founded in 1999, with Rs3-4 crore in seed capital, on the 20-acre plot that his family owned. The money came from family, friends and banks. We had to mortgage everything, says Samant. If the wine business didnt work, we could lose all of the Rs3 crore and some more. It was all or nothing. Today, Sula is worth more than Rs1,000 crore and buys grapes from 3,000 acres of vineyards, mostly under contract farming. Its wines are priced from Rs250-1,750 in Maharashtra. The medium-bodied, food-friendly Sula Cabernet Shiraz, the herbaceous, crisp and dry Sula Sauvignon Blanc, and the semi-dry Sula Chenin Blanc that works as a delightful aperitif are some of Sulas best-sellers. Samant says Maharashtra, Karnataka, Delhi and Goa are their biggest markets.I had never thought Sula would become this big, he says.Not surprisingly, he is now primarily a wine drinker. I have wine fridges at home and I have all my Sula wines there as well as the wines that we import, such as Hardys and Cono Sur. When he wants a break from wine, he falls back on the old favourite: a good gin and tonic with a dash of nostalgia. *****Sula has put Nashik on the world map, says Samant. Some people might disagree, but, in my opinion, Nashik didnt exist before Sula, he says. Today, Sula has the biggest non-religious tourist site in Maharashtra. We had 230,000 visitors last year.The company has also transformed the surrounding villages, providing a livelihood to locals. In Sawargaon village, at least one person from every family works for us in some way. We have among the highest proportion of tribals in our workforce. I just hope this can be sustained, says Samant.Samant is upbeat about the future. Consumption has been growing at about 20% every year for the past couple of years, and we have still only seen the tip of the iceberg. Wine is still less than 1% of the total alcohol consumption in India, and I see no reason why the industry shouldnt grow at about 10-15% every year in the next decade. There is a lot of potential for brands to grow. It is a great time to be in the business.So where does he sees Sula in, say, a decade from now? I dont know. If someone had predicted 10 years ago that I would reach here, I would have laughed at them, Samant says. Now I dont know where the limit is.",2016-09-23,6InfSbJq3ObxfblrwddaoL,Sula Vineyards CEO Rajeev Samant on his journey from Napa Valley to Nashik and the challenges that remain,15:19,Rajeev Samant: The Winemaker

Lowering the charge without scale will have a negative impact,added Surya, who is also the managing director of ItzCash Card Ltd.The government on Tuesday provided highlights of the panels recommendations, but did not release the complete report. The highlights said that per capita cashless transactions by non-banks a year in India was merely 11 compared to 728 in Singapore, 355 in the UK and 142 in Brazil.It is very essential to find revenue alternatives not dependent on MDR i.e. using smartphones for payments, which requires low capital expenditure for the payment infrastructure, said Sunil Kulkarni, deputy managing director, Oxigen Services (India) Pvt. Ltd, a payment company.Surya said that tax rates applicable to the merchants should be lowered as their revenue from digital transactions increases.The RBI had already lowered the MDR rates on December 16. The MDR for debit card payments, including for payments made to government, was capped at 0.25% for transactions up to Rs1,000 and 0.5% between Rs1,000-2,000.However, there is no RBI cap on MDR on credit card payments. RBI said reduced charges will come into effect from 1 January 2017 and shall be applicable till 31 March 2017.The existing MDR cap before January 1was 0.75% for transactions up to Rs2,000 and 1% for over Rs2,000.According to a July, 2016 report by the Boston Consultancy Group, market for cashless payments will grow 10 times by 2020 to reach $500 billion.

Stating that the companys consumers, suppliers, vendors, partners and shareholders are all Indians, he said: My contribution to taxes and salaries are all to Indians and therefore I am at a loss to understand as what else must I be doing to be called as Indian. He was responding to a query on how the company views allegations by Patanjali through various advertisements that just like the way East India Company enslaved and looted us, multinational companies are still doing the same by selling soap, shampoo, toothpaste, cream, powder and similar daily items at exorbitant price. Narayanan further said: So, while the statements are read also by my board both India and globally in Switzerland, we do not change our views simply because of the rhetoric. Choosing not to get into a slanging match, he said: Irrespective of what people might say, they have their points of view, I respect their point of view.

Citing the example of the Maggi crisis, Narayanan said not even once that during the entire crisis, the company had a single incident of unrest. Even though Nestlé India shut down five factories for five months due to the ban on Maggi, it did not have a single problem at any of the plants, he added. No distributor left us or supplier left us and no shareholder betrayed us and that tells you that they are happy dealing with us as a company and they are happy with the trust and relationship that we have established these years, Narayanan said further. If all these remain with me and I do not change my behaviour, then why should I be worried what people might say or think about my antecedents. On whether Nestlé India will foray into ayurvedic FMCG products, which is fast becoming popular, he replied in the negative. The difference for Nestlé is Nestlé looks for nutrition and does not look at the origin or the source of the nutrition. This is a company involved in science, technology and R&D in nutrition, he explained. According to Narayanan, Nestlé Indias aim is to make efficacious products and it does extensive trials to ensure the items are sustainable and stable and give the right kind of nutrition as far as consumers are concerned. I do not see our strategy changing from a primacy of nutrition, science, technology and wellness to a primacy which needs to say that something from this stream of medicine simply because its nice one to use.

0.56,"Beijing: China, the worlds biggest clean-energy investor, lowered its solar and wind power targets for 2020, a reflection of how record installations of renewables have overwhelmed the ability of the nations grid to absorb the new electricity.
				   
				China is now aiming for 110 gigawatts of solar power by 2020, a 27% reduction from an earlier target, according to a webcast posted on the website of the national energy administration that cited the agencys chief engineer, Han Shui. The nation reduced its goal for wind power by 16% to 210 gigawatts.While China has poured billions of dollars into clean energy in recent years, the ability to deliver the newly-generated electricity from where its produced to where its needed has lagged. The mismatch has left solar and wind capacity sitting idle in some parts of the country, hurting companies such as China Longyuan Power Group Corp. and China Datang Corp. Renewable Power Co.The global large solar energy valuation peers index, which counts many Chinese manufacturers among its 20 members, has slumped 42% this year.The target reduction, which was largely expected by the solar industry, comes at a time when concerns about oversupply are pressuring solar stocks, analysts Ben Kallo and Tyler Frank of Robert W. Baird & Co. wrote in a 7 November note. Utility-scale projects will likely be most affected, and rooftop remains a potential source of upside.Earlier targetThe government earlier expected to have 150 gigawatts of solar power and 250 gigawatts of wind by 2020, PVnews.cn reported last year, citing Zhu Ming, deputy director of renewable energy department at the NEA.The lower targets were immediately criticized by some environmental groups who said the new goals arent good enough.The wind power capacity targets do not reflect the reality of the sectors growth and solar targets fail to expand the sector beyond its record 2015 growth, Greenpeace East Asia said in an e-mailed statement.Given the urgency of combating air pollution and climate change, we would expect the government to accelerate investments in clean energy, rather than stabilize or slow down, Greenpeace said.Since 2012, solar capacity has surged more than seven-fold, while wind has almost doubled amid a push by China to generate 15% of its power from renewable energy and nuclear by 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The rapid growth in capacity has left China struggling to integrate power supplies from renewable sources even as the government continues to promote clean energy as an alternative to more polluting fuels like coal and natural gas.China idled 33.9 billion kilowatt-hours of wind power last year, up 69% from a year earlier, the NEA said in August. Idled capacity at solar farms has also begun to appear, especially in the nations northwest, it said.Still, even with the lowered ambitions, China is due to see a surge in new clean-energy capacity. Solar will more than double by 2020 from 2015 levels, while wind will increase by 50%, according to Bloomberg new energy finance data.Bloomberg ",2016-11-08,6dL5kbnR8Dch5CNNjSrv9M,"Now, China aims for 110 gigawatts of solar power by 2020, a 27% reduction from an earlier target",16:24,"China scales back solar, wind ambitions as renewables cool"
0.16,"Hong Kong/San Francisco: In Chinas internet warzone, theres a road map for success: find a rich backer, get lots of money, burn it to buy market share.
				   
				The latest chapter of that playbook is being written by two young entrepreneurs each offering an update on a former icon of Chinas communist partythe bicycle.In one corner is Dai Wei, 25, whose Beijing Bikelock Technology Co. cycle-sharing startup, known as Ofo, won about $100 million backing in September from investors including the venture fund backed by Xiaomi Corp. founder Lei Jun and Didi Chuxing, the ride-hailing giant that just beat Uber Technologies Inc. out of China. The funding is said to have valued the start-up at $500 million.In the other is Hu Weiwei, who received similar funding days later for her Beijing Mobike Technology Co. from a group including Tencent Holdings Ltd., the nations biggest internet company and, ironically, a long-term backer of Didi.This is the trial by fire of Chinas internet landscape, where alliances change in days and start-ups bleed billions of dollars offering freebies to get customers, only to merge months later so they can take on the next upcoming competitor.Tencent and Didi each picking a different winner makes the competition much more unpredictable and interesting, said Cao Yang, Beijing-based analyst at internet consultant IResearch. It really comes down to which founder can adapt faster and leverage resources better.Bike-sharing is hardly new. There are about 600 such operations globally, with a market that could grow by 20% a year to generate as much as $5.8 billion in revenue by 2020, according to consultancy Roland Berger.Most, like Pariss Velib or Londons so-called Boris Bikes are run or set up by the local government, often with corporate sponsors, and bikes are available from racks at set locations. What differentiates Ofo and Mobike is that users find and pay for bicycles via a smartphone app and then leave the vehicle wherever they want.Each company is targeting a different market. Mobike has gone for high-end branding with bikes that cost as much as 3,000 yuan ($440) to build and have snazzy orange wheels, solid-core tires and satellite navigation. Ofo is targeting students with bright yellow two-wheelers costing only about 250 yuan that dont have GPS and rent for just 1 yuan per hour, typically half that of Mobike. Beijings public bikes are free for the first hour and then 1 yuan per subsequent hour.Mobike locates its vehicles via an integrated GPS. Ofo so-named because the word looks like a bicycledoes so by tracking the smartphones of its riders and sending a code to unlock the bike.These guys all think they can be Amazon, hoping to burn money first and then make money later, said Rawen Huang, Hong Kong-based founder of Petrel Capital, which invests in Chinas internet space. Will we look back in five years time and say Oh my, I cant believe they got funding at that valuation? Probably.In the capitals electronics heartland of Zhongguancun, where high-tech heavyweights like Lenovo Group Ltd. rub shoulders with startups and malls crammed with gadgets, two of Ofos yellow bikes stand in the hallway outside an apartment, which Dai has converted to a makeshift office.In the early stages of a company, expanding is more important than defending, says Dai, echoing the insights imparted by his mentor Cheng Wei, founder of Didi. The faster you use your money, the more efficient, the more money you raise, the stronger you become. Then you control the market.Its a strategy that helped Didi beat off more than 30 rivals. At the height of its battle with Uber, both companies were burning through $1 billion a year, mostly to subsidize fares. Didi now handles more than 11 million rides a day across about 400 cities. While Didi has yet to become profitable, Dai said Ofo is already making money.Bespectacled and soft spoken, Dai gained the support of Didis early investors Wang Gang and GSR Ventures Allen Zhu. The Peking University Ph.D dropout founded Ofo with four other students, ditching their original project on cycling tourism to focus on bike-sharing.Wang was instrumental in helping Ofo find a big tree to lean on, securing not only financial backing from Didi, but also potential access to its 300 million users.A 30-minute bike ride away, in a technology incubator called 768 Creativity Shejiyuan, Hu Weiwei landed an even more powerful ally. Tencents WeChat instant messaging app has more than 800 million users and already integrates things like Didis car-hailing service and JD.com Inc.s shopping function.The 34-year-old former journalist said the two companies are starting to coordinate on certain technology aspects.In a second-floor office down a dark passageway, next to a communal toilet, Hu speaks in a low octave, punctuating her key message: The fact that Tencent is investing in us shows that we share the same philosophy about products and technology.The investment from Tencent, along with Hillhouse Capital and Sequoia Capital, couldnt have been more timely. Following Didis announcement it would back Ofo, users like Shanghai-based Mike Huang began unsubscribing from Mobike to get back their 299 yuan deposits on concern the company would shut down.It just shows you how important the big companies are for the survival of start-ups in China, said Huang, an entrepreneur who has a womens health app. He resubscribed after hearing about the Tencent investment. Chinese internet companies are still in that phase of burning cash to win market share and the brutality of competition is even worse than Silicon Valley.Ofo and Mobike will need more than discounts to win users, they need bikes.Mobike said it has about 30,000 bicycles spread across the major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, which have an estimated combined urban population of more than 74 million. It aims to stock at least 100,000 bikes for each city by year-end and expand to other cities.Compare that with the more than 66,500 public bikes offered by the public transport corporation of Hangzhou, a city of about 8 million.Ofo says it has more than 85,000 bikes, mostly on university campuses, and expects to take its service to other places in China. Both rivals are eyeing markets in Europe.The ride-sharers are trying to reverse a decline in cycling in China, which spent the past two decades promoting cars. China had 670 million bikes in 1995. By 2013 it had 370 million.For some Beijingers, the billion-dollar fight between Ofo and Mobike comes down to which happens to be more convenient.I dont care whose bike it is, Ill use one if I spot one and feel too lazy to walk, said Guang Geng, who works in the Zhongguancun area. Honestly I just tell them apart by color. Bloomberg",2016-10-31,6k9UmdZnwfiV4Vttd1CAII,"Ofo and Mobike will need more than discounts to win users in China, they need bikes",14:24,Ofo fuels Chinas bike-share battle

				The latter was a wig, and the former was just bad science fiction packaged by consultants as a $600 billion hair-raiser. But Dewang Mehta, the chief lobbyist for Indias fledgling software services industry, carried off both with aplomb, convincing businesses that at the stroke of midnight of the new millennium, their computer systems would crash because old programs measured years in two digits instead of four. The solution, he persuaded them, was to let a horde of techies from Bangalore and Hyderabad go through each line of code and fix the Y2K bug. That was the birth of Indias massively successful software services industry, which died on Friday after a short battle with newer digital technologies. At the time of its demise, the business was worth $110 billion in annual export revenue.The first hint that the end was near came on Thursday when Tata Consultancy Services, the biggest Indian software vendor by market value, announced a virtual stalling of its business in the September quarter from the previous three months. After Infosys followed up by slashing its full-year revenue guidance for the second time in three months, it was time to turn off the ventilator.Infosys revenue growth pre-LehmanA coroners inquiry unearthed three signs of decay, the first of which shows how Indian companies cheap-talent-fueled growth ran out of breath. In the four quarters before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Infosys saw revenue increase an average 29% in constant-currency terms. Back then, Dublin-based Accentures growth was just half as high. But theres nothing exceptional about Indian companies expansion anymore. All that investors have heard from managements this year is gloomy commentary on how challenging its become to get clients to open their wallets. When the companies do make news nowadays, its more often for dodgy business practices, regulatory slaps on the wrist, and senior-level exits.A slowdown alone wouldnt have stopped the Indian industry if it had been able to embrace smac, or social, mobile, analytics and cloud-based technologies. But the vendors wasted so much time defending their legacy business of writing code for and maintaining purpose-built enterprise applications that they failed to make a mark in the new digital world. As an analysis from  Mint shows, the dominant trio of Tata Consultancy, Infosys and Wipro between them had 1.5 times more workers doing digital stuff last year than Accenture. But the revenue they garnered was 40% less than what the latter chalked up from newer technologies. That makes the typical digital-tech employee of an Indian vendor 25% as efficient as his counterpart at the global consultant. This gap sets the clock back on Indian companies, which have taken years to narrow the productivity differential:Maybe its just banking clients and their inability to pay like they once did. Or perhaps its a combination of weak global growth, Brexit, protectionism and Donald Trumps vacillating stance on US visas for Indian technology workers. Hoping that turbulence is temporary, investors are still paying a hefty premium for future growth. They may get lucky for a while. Still, a dead-cat bounce from delayed orders coming through would hardly count as proof of life.The millennium scare got Indian software a foot in the door at global corporations. But now the shoe is on the other foot. Robotics and artificial intelligence are putting the vendors labour-intensive business at risk of obsolescence. Even if the concern is as puffed up as Y2K, with plenty of growth candidates in the Indian start-up world, at least for some investors it may be time to back new horses rather than flog dead ones.

0.66,"Mphasis Ltds shares rose 3.18% on Tuesday, on news that the race for buying Hewlett-Packard Co.s (HPs) 60.5% stake in the company is hotting up. 
				   
				The Times of India said on Monday that Tech Mahindra Ltd is leading the race and is contemplating an offer that is at a 20% premium to the recent market price of Mphasis.Its true that a 20% premium to the current market price will be an aggressive offer. But its a bit premature for minority shareholders of Mphasis to get excited. This is because any decent offer will be possible only if HP sweetens the deal for the acquirer.As things stand, about a fourth of the companys revenue comes via HP, and it is declining at a fast pace. In the December quarter, revenue from the HP channel fell by almost 12% quarter-on-quarter. Five years ago, this business had an annual revenue run rate of $700 million; it has now fallen to around $220 million, based on the December quarter revenue. At this rate, the business will soon disappear. It doesnt make sense for any acquirer to pay a premium, unless HP provides some surety for providing business to Mphasis for at least three-five years. This may well be in HPs interest as well, as a decent- enough premium will help HP garner nearly $1 billion from the sale. But, of course, this cant be taken for granted. HP also has a wholly-owned subsidiary in India, which appears to have been a larger beneficiary of its offshoring efforts in recent years. As far as Tech Mahindras interest in the company goes, Mphasis, with its large exposure to the banking and financial services sector, will be a good fit. This is a segment where Tech Mahindra has lagged behind peers, and the acquisition will increase its scale in the business to a respectable $1 billion.But having said that, the risk of paying too much and merger integration issues are areas of concern. Analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd say in an 8 February note, One of the key things a buyer would look at when considering MPHL is the margin that it makes in the Direct Channel versus HP channel... Based on our calculation, direct channel Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margins could be around 11% (nearly half of the HP Channel Ebit margins of around 20%).In most of the recent deals in the IT (information technology) services space, the target companies have had margins of around 20% and their portfolios have been far more diversified. As such, theres hardly any reason for paying a high premium for Mphasis over comparable deals such as iGate Corp.s acquisition of Patni Computer Systems Ltd.It seems the only way HP can extract good value is to commit to certain revenues via the HP channel for the next few years.

0.3,"Bengaluru: Payments processing firm PayU India plans to launch two new businessesconsumer credit and digital bankingand accelerate merchant acquisition as it aims to diversify and become an all-round payments hub, chief executive B. Amrish Rau said. The company plans to process $10 billion in transactions in the year ending March 2018, up from an estimated $5.5 billion this financial year.
				   
				In September, PayU, the digital payments provider owned by South Africas Naspers Group, bought rival Citrus Pay for $130 million in an all-cash deal. Rau, a co-founder of Citrus, became CEO of the merged entity, replacing former PayU India head Nitin Gupta, who left to start his own venture.Since then, PayU has been working on providing credit to customers, initially for low-price purchases such as groceries and movie tickets. It will launch a product called LazyPay this month that will allow customers to buy things and pay a few days later. Purchase and payment dont need to be together. If weve seen customers transact over a few months, we know the likelihood of getting paid back. The crucial part with LazyPay is the speed of transaction. It allows people to pay at their convenience, much like how telephone companies allow post-paid. The next step will be to increase the credit limit, Rau said.  Some time next year, PayU also plans to introduce a digital payments platform that will put the company in direct competition with the likes of Paytm, Freecharge and Mobikwik.The aim will be to move money faster for consumers. Once the consumer starts trusting us in this aspect, we can then offer various financial products and become a digital bank. We have to combine three or four things: P2P play, digital payments huball your daily payments can be made from the same appand letting you move money faster. Its not clear what exact shape this will take but we want to enable all banking and financial services-related transactions for customers through the platform, Rau said.PayU already has a digital wallet though its insignificant compared with Paytm and others. Rau said, We think of the wallet more as a place where your cards are stored digitally. It would give faster access to your cards or bank transaction. Its something that will be there in the digital banking app. As the new initiatives take shape, PayU is expanding its core business of providing payment gateway services. The company, which gets a majority of its revenue from consumer Internet firms, has introduced a product called Selfie that allows individuals and small businesses to sell products and accept payments across platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Together as PayU and Citrus were covering 40-50% of the e-commerce market. Then, there are small businesses that are coming online that are underserved. Selfie is for merchants who dont have their own sites and are using Selfie to promote and sell their products.

0.58,"New Delhi: As an organization, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is changing the way payments are made in the countryfrom launching a card payment settlement system that competes with Visa and MasterCard to setting up a platform to facilitate instant money transfer. 
				   
				The Reserve Bank of India-backed organization is preparing to launch the second version of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) called UPI 2.0 by early next year and is betting that the upgraded version will accelerate Indias movement towards a cashless economy. In an email interview, NPCI managing director and chief executive A.P. Hota spoke about the progress made and challenges encountered by UPI so far, and the latest milestones that have been set for the payment system. Edited excerpts:Since its launch, how many banks have taken to UPI technology?Twenty banks have launched UPI. Mobile apps of 17 banks are available on the Google play store.In the last one month, what are the challenges that have emerged with respect to UPI?The main challenge is awareness. Though media has played a splendid role, for making the customer to actually download the app and make use of the same, its required that the value proposition of the technology needs to be clearly explained.But we know that unlike social media apps, adoption of electronic payments would be slow.How much time does it take for any financial product to integrate UPI?It takes time. The simplest form of mobile payment is person-to-person payments. Merchant payment is complex and requires integration with banks as well as merchants payment system.

Mobile payment processes are relatively new.Currently, how many UPI transactions have started to take place?On a daily basis, about 4,000 transactions are taking place from about 300,000 customers who have downloaded a UPI-based bank app.So, apart from the banks, how many other entities such as a payment gateway, have adopted UPI?Not many have, but we expect about 50 such merchants by the end of October integrated with UPI. In the next one year, what are the targets for UPIin terms of bank adoption, consumer traction and usage of UPI by other payment products?We expect 50 banks, 15 million customers, 100 merchants and around one million transactions as a peak day volume by March 2017.What is the strategy being used to counter the awareness challenge you earlier mentioned and to reach the targets mentioned above?Once we reach about 30 banks including State Bank of India and HDFC Bank, we will start an awareness campaign. We will also add new use cases of UPI technology such as merchant payments and bill payments. We have also planned a UPI version 2.0 for March 2017.What are some of the features that UPI 2.0 will have?UPI 2.0 will have enhanced features based on the feedback received from banks.

0.63,"Mumbai: The central bank is working on setting up a financial sector resolution corporation, said N.S. Vishwanathan, deputy governor, Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
				   
				We have discussed with the government the shape this corporation will take. Its purpose is to not only provide insurance to financial companies but also to provide resolution, Vishwanathan said at the Mint Annual Banking Conclave.The deputy governor said that while non-financial sector companies had the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to deal with resolution, the proposed corporation is likely to help protect financial sector companies.In September 2016, a panel set up by the government had released a draft law on financial sector resolution. This draft had suggested setting up a corporation to manage resolution. And it had also said that once the Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill, 2016 was enacted, the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) could be dissolved and all its functions passed on to the new corporation.Vishwanathan pointed out that the regulator had already put in place measures to de-risk bank balance sheets by reducing excessive exposure to large corporate accounts.We are also using this to develop the capital market. Banks will have to find different ways of using their funds, he said.In December 2016, RBI said that it would cap banks exposure to a group of connected companies at 25% of the lenders core capital, seeking to reduce concentration risk in a banking industry laden with bad loans.The central bank lowered the limit from 40% of the banks total capital funds, which include both Tier 1 (core) and Tier 2 capital, and gave banks until 2019 to meet the new norms.In the case of an individual company, this limit would be changed to 20% of Tier 1 capital, compared with 15% of total capital funds currently, RBI had said.The deputy governor said that while stressed loans were something that the banking sector was grappling with, the setting up of the Central Repository for Information on Large Credit (CRILC) was helping them gather more information and take better calls while resolving stress.RBI is also looking at the financial technology space and assessing the impact that it could have on various kinds of financial services.We need to make exploratory efforts on what needs to be regulated, how it will be regulated in a way that innovation is not undermined, Vishwanathan said.We have a multi-regulatory working group that we have put in place to look at the entire gamut of issues that are affecting the industry and hopefully will get their report soon, he added.",2017-01-23,7MPtvBBSDuHfH4czTZfcdL,"RBI deputy governor N.S.

				Volumes grew more than 10% y-o-y, but realizations slipped. Also, the quarters Ebitda at Rs2,244 crore was marginally below estimates of some analysts. This miss was primarily due to increase in minimum wages, which resulted in a sequential rise in employee cost/tonne. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.While the stock has lost 2.2% after the September quarter earnings were announced, i.e. in the last three trading sessions, the anticipated short-term negative impact of currency ban has led to correction of 26.4% since 9 November.In a post-earnings conference call, the management said demonetization of Rs500/1,000 notes has not affected sales volume till date and the proportion of cash in cement purchase is only 10-15%. But some brokerage firms have raised a red flag by trimming their Ebitda estimates. Our channel checks indicate pressure on demand in most parts of the country. We expect dispatches to get impacted going ahead. We revise our Ebitda estimates downwards by 3.3%/13.8% for FY17E/FY18E to factor in lower demand in H2FY17 due to the demonetization issue, Emkay Research said in a report.

While the bank has settled some of its biggest legal cases in the past two months, an initial request that it pay $14 billion to settle a US Justice Department investigation of mortgage-backed bonds spooked some investors in the quarter.There was a clear impact from the negative news flow around Deutsche Bank in the fall, especially on the global markets unit, said Daniel Regli, an analyst with MainFirst whose recommendation on the stock is under review. It remains to be seen whether this effect will be reversed in 2017.ALSO READ | Deutsche Bank fined $630 million for failures over Russian money-launderingThe banks net loss narrowed to 1.89 billion in the three months through December, from a loss of 2.12 billion a year earlier.

				But while Infosys Ltd and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) have presented contrasting images of each other at times, together the two big Indian software exporters have held a mirror. Analysts have used them to view global spending on those invisible lines of computer code that enable large corporations to run themselves. No longer. The picture the duo are displaying now is more about how their own industry is at risk of being overrun by robots.Infosys operating margin 
Before last quarters results, Infosys was doing a relatively better job of gaining investor approval. This time last year, TCS shares enjoyed a 15% higher valuation than Infosys, based on analysts expectations of future earnings. By this week, that had turned into a small discount.Then on Thursday, TCS beat revenue and profit estimates for the June quarter, but operating margins shrank to 25%. Thats below the managements targeted range of 26% to 28%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Infosys, which reported on Friday, cut its sales forecast for the year. Worse still, its operating margin came in at just 24.1%, extending a nearly four-year decline in relative profitability for the Bangalore-based group.Two years ago, Infosys tapped SAP executive Vishal Sikka to take over from the founders, who all seemed bent on having a go at running the company before retirement. For a while, it looked like they might run it aground. But while Infosys has steadied under Sikka, its increasingly clear that the new normal for operating margins for both Infosys and TCS may be around 25%, and not the 29% to 31% that at least Infosys used to hit fairly regularly before its management merry-go-around left it dizzy.Profitability is now capped by robots, or, to be more specific, a combination of artificial intelligence, digital technologies, blockchain and other innovations that are challenging the traditional strategy of throwing people at complex software problems and charging clients for their time. But while the large Indian vendors are themselves investing in these new areas, so much of their legacy business depends on exploiting the price difference between techies in the West and in developing countries, its not clear if theyll be able to switch to a people-lite business model in time.For the top four Indian vendors, growth in total employment has slowed to 8% levels, from 106% in the year ended in March 2012. But nimbler challengers are threatening to nibble at juicy businesses faster than the Indian companies can slim down. For instance, UK-based start-up Thought Machine has created a new, blockchain-based core banking package that resides in the cloud and wont require expensive in-house data centers, according to a report this week in Artificial Intelligence Online. TCS has made two acquisitions of more than $500 million in value, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. The last was in 2014. Infosys hasnt done any of that size with its $5 billion in cash. TCS fell as much as 3.8% in Mumbai on Friday, while Infosys slumped almost 11%. The relative performance of the two is no longer much of an investment theme. Of far greater importance is how they take on those robots. Bloomberg

				The company was granted a formal licence on 14 October. BP granted licence to market Motor Spirit (petrol) and High Speed Diesel (diesel)another milestone for BP in India, the company tweeted. The UK-based firm, as also Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd, was given approval by the oil ministry to retail petrol and diesel, officials said. A significant step in #BPs partnership with Indiabeen granted licence to market Motor Spirit and High Speed Diesel, it said. A BP India spokesperson had earlier this month stated that: BP sees a strong future for transportation fuels in India. We are keen to be involved in this market and contribute to its development. The company had in January this year won in-principle approval to retail aviation turbine fuel (ATF) to airlines in India. Subsequently, it got full approval for that. We can confirm we have been granted approval for marketing for ATF, the BP spokesperson said. For a licence to retail auto fuelspetrol, diesel and ATF, a company should have invested a minimum of Rs2,000 crore in exploration or production of oil and gas, oil refining, gas or product pipeline or terminals leading to additionally to the existing assets or creation of new assets in the eligible activities. BP, which had in 2011 bought 30% interest in 21 exploration blocks of Reliance Industries for $7.2 billion, had cited investment of nearly $500 million in oil and gas exploration and production for gaining the licence.

0.18,"On the face of it, the results for the third quarter of 2016-17 will show a stellar profit growth for banks simply because lenders suffered terrible losses in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal as the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBI) asset quality review (AQR) had forced unprecedented provisioning.
				   
				Analysts expect the net profit of banks to show a jump of as much as 95% for the quarter to December, marked by a surge in treasury income and a decent net interest income growth. Of course, treasury income is expected to be the key driver as bond yields dropped more than 30 basis points (bps) during the quarter and, in all, 65 bps from the peak to the bottom of the three months to December. Margins will likely improve as the deluge of deposits because of the withdrawal of high-value bank notes, largely into low-cost current and savings account, would have fetched banks a decent spread of 175 bps even if they had just parked the entire money at RBIs reverse repo tenders. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.But consensus earnings per share (EPS) estimates for 2016-17 for the BSE Bankex index have dropped 12.9% since 8 November, as pointed out in a Mint article on Friday, and this indicates the market is less sanguine on banks in the post-demonetized economy. The worry is justified as, firstly, demonetization has not repaired the shredded asset quality fabric of banks at all; in fact, in some cases, it has made it worse. The fresh pain points on asset quality that will arise due to demonetization have been given a temporary relief after RBI relaxed classification norms. This simply means that for at least one quarter, the slippages may not worsen.But by far the most worrying factor is the near-collapse of credit growth. Data from RBI shows loan growth dropped to 5.1%, the lowest in half a century as of 23 December. Unless disbursals pick up, this potentially spells doom for banks future earnings, especially when their turf is threatened by the bond market and even new players. Net interest income, the core income a bank generates through lending, will begin falling steadily in the following quarters. A surge in deposits is of no use if the money is not lent by banks to earn income. Margins could also come under pressure unless banks begin grabbing high-yield loan assets in place of passive investments in low-yielding government securities.In short, a clutch of good numbers such as a surge in profit growth, a rise in core income and treasury profits will give no cause for elation and worsening metrics through rise in bad loan ratios wont mean its the end of the world for banks.

0.32,"London/Tokyo: Toshiba Corp plans to withdraw from its lead role in projects to build nuclear plants in Britain and India, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said, marking a retreat as it wrestles with an imminent multi-billion dollar writedown.
				   
				Such a move would leave Toshibas US-based Westinghouse focused on the much narrower field of nuclear reactors and services, rather than civil engineering for nuclear power plants, or their construction, people familiar with the matter said.But it would throw into question the future of a key plank in Britains plans to replace ageing nuclear reactors, and the future of Indias biggest nuclear project to date.Toshiba became one of the nuclear sectors biggest players with the purchase of Westinghouse in 2006, the height of a short-lived boom. But the industry was left battered by the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster and Toshibas woes have only deepened - first with a 2015 accounting scandal and now damaging cost overruns at US projects.People familiar with the matter have said the writedown on the US business  set to be detailed on 14 February when Toshiba reports earnings  could be around $6 billion, wiping out the groups shareholder equity.NuGen, a Toshiba-led venture with French utility Engie , was set up to build three AP1000 nuclear reactors designed by the Japanese conglomerates Westinghouse unit at the Moorside site on the coast of Cumbria.But the $15 billion-$20 billion investment is now an impossible financial burden for Toshiba to help shoulder, one of the sources said, adding it had not yet notified the UK government.Two of the sources said Engie also wants to pull out of NuGen, as new chief executive Isabelle Kocher does not want to invest in new nuclear projects. Engie declined to comment.That could leave Britain searching for new backers.It has to be someone with a big cheque book. The real question for London is to what extent should this be a private sector venture anyway, said one veteran adviser.One of the sources said Toshiba was considering a full exit from the NuGen project, in which it currently has a 60% stake, but would take a firm decision once it had completed the sale of a stake in its memory chips business. That sale was announced last month but started on Friday.All three sources with knowledge of the matter declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.A Toshiba spokesman said it was reviewing all its nuclear power business outside Japan. Nothing has been decided at this time, including the impact on our Moorside nuclear project.NuGen declined to comment.Out of IndiaIn India, Westinghouse has also been in talks with state-owned Nuclear Power Corporation of India about a contract to build six AP1000s, a project strongly backed by both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and former US President Barack Obama.The three sources said that was now almost impossible.The Indian government was happy to have one sole counterpart, but this cannot continue, the first source said, adding that either an Indian civil engineering group or a foreign, possibly American, group would have to step in to negotiate, oversee and eventually finance the project.Westinghouse would instead just provide nuclear equipment, the source said.Representatives for Indias state-run nuclear body and the ministry of external affairs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Westinghouse has traditionally been a builder of nuclear reactors, not entire nuclear power plants including steam turbines, generators and transformers.But as tightening safety regulations following Fukushima made building nuclear plants more expensive, nuclear reactor builders and their shareholders have been increasingly forced to take on the civil engineering side too.The source said Westinghouse will return to its roots as a nuclear specialist, while Toshiba will stop taking on projects to build entire nuclear plants just so that Westinghouse can sell its AP1000 reactors.Toshiba will withdraw from being a general contractor for nuclear plants, the source said.

0.28,"Sometimes it is better to chop off a decaying limb of a company, especially when it starts to infect its more profitable businesses. Avantha Group-owned capital goods firm Crompton Greaves Ltd (CG) has done precisely this. On Wednesday, it inked an agreement for the sale of its international power business for 115 million (around Rs.850 crore) to a US-based private equity fund which is likely to be completed in the next six months.
				   
				This brings a ray of hope for  investors in the beleaguered firm. For 17 long quarters, CGs international operations, which comprised about half the consolidated business, have incurred losses. Worse, total borrowing continued to rise, while the international businessbuilt through acquisitionsfailed to churn out cash. Over a period, the losses from the overseas operations pulled down the companys overall performance too.For the December 2015 quarter, CG posted a net loss of Rs.107 crore, from a sizeable profit in the year-ago period. Not surprisingly, the Street reacted adversely to the results and the stock, which was outperforming the benchmark indices earlier, fell 30% in 10 days.Against this backdrop, investors welcomed the news of the sale. The CG stock rose by about 9% on Wednesday, after it was known that the proceeds will straightaway pare debt of Rs.900 crore. The stock fell 0.63% on Thursday.It does not matter that there will be no cash inflows to CG. Whats important is that the ailing businessesspread over the US, France, Ireland, Hungary, Belgium and Indonesiaare finally out of the companys turf.That said, some of the power businesses will remain part of the Indian operations.

-0.21,"If the December and March quarter results of banks showed state-run lenders as weaklings and private banks as winners, the June quarter numbers separated the sector into three clear partsthe weak, the still vulnerable and the winners. Collectively, public sector banks continued to be the worst performers with bad loans doubling from a year ago and private banks were the winners after making reasonable profits.
				   
				The weaklings: Small and mid-sized public sector banks featured here with their gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) exceeding 11% of loan book. However, even some private banks saw bad loan ratios worsen. For instance, the GNPA ratio for Dhanlaxmi Bank Ltd rose to 7.02% from 6.36% in the March quarter. ICICI Bank Ltd, too, saw GNPA ratio rise for the third quarter to 5.87% but, given its strong capital position, it would be unfair to term it a weakling. Unlike ICICI Bank, small- and mid-sized public sector lenders have shrunk loan portfolios by refraining from fresh lending even as existing loans decayed at a faster pace. As loan books shrink and bad loans age, these banks will find it difficult to sustain themselves. Four state-run banksCentral Bank of India, Indian Overseas Bank, United Bank of India and UCO Bankhad a capital adequacy ratio a hairs breadth away from the regulatory minimum of 9.6%.The still vulnerable: Asset quality of the countrys largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI), stabilized as its gross bad loans rose by a modest 3.43%. It looks like much of the pain has passed for SBI, with GNPAs at 6.94% of total loans amid a huge decline of 70% in fresh slippages (new loans turning bad). But the lender has a watch list of Rs30,000 crore loans, estimating that 30% of these could turn bad. In the June quarter, Rs2,165 crore worth of slippages was from the watch list. In the private sector, Axis Bank Ltd, too, has a watch list of around Rs20,000 crore in loans. Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank and ICICI Bank, too, are vulnerable given the rise in bad loans.The winners: Clearly, the best of the pack are from the private sector. HDFC Bank Ltd continued to show strong asset quality by capping its bad loan ratio at a little above 1%. The lender delivered 20% growth in net profit and its net interest income, too, grew by a healthy 22%. Others in this group were IndusInd Bank Ltd, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd and Karur Vysya Bank.",2016-10-09,88pKqHOheIWFhI9dumLsSP,The public sector banks continued to be the worst performers with bad loans doubling from a year ago and private banks were the winners after making reasonable profits,23:12,"Banking: the weak, the vulnerable and the winners"
0.48,"New Delhi: Everyone sees struggle, only the intensity differs, says Hari Das with a big smile. For Das, the intensity was always more than too much. 
				   
				Farming had left his family in debt, so his parents moved to Delhi from a village near Khajuraho in Madhya Pradesh in 1986, in the hope of making money. They started working as labourers for a construction site which was to become a part of the American Embassy School (in south  Delhis Chanakyapuri area), says Das, who was born in Delhi. Five years later, his father died of a brain tumour. It must have happened because of the weight he used to carry on his head every day, believes Das. The tumour was diagnosed at the last stage; even if it was detected earlier, we couldnt have done anything. Ma and pa used to earn Rs10 each a day, which was never enough to feed a family of five, says Das, who has two siblings. From then on, his mother was the sole earner. Das must have been three years old when his mother put him in a crèche, organized at the construction site by Mobile Creches, a Delhi-based non-profit that offers day care and education programmes for children of construction workers. Initially, I wasnt too keen but my mother insisted. Our house (in Sanjay Niwas slum) was 5 minutes away from the site, so I used to go to the crèche every day, along with my sister and brother at 2pm, study, eat and play games, recalls Das whose favourite part of the day was eating bananas offered at the crèche with the other 10 children. He continued going to the crèche even after joining a nearby government-run school at the age of 5. Our mother was very particular about education. She would work extra hours to ensure that we went to school, he says. Till the age of 10, Das used to spend his mornings at the crèche and the afternoons at the school.Mobile Creches helped too, with its scholarship scheme. Till sixth standard they offered Rs900 if we passed a year, from Class VI-X, it was Rs1,200 for passing each class, and Rs1,500 for the last two years, says Das. Each year, Das secured the scholarship, which helped him in his education and paid some expenses at home too. The crèche was removed after the completion of the construction. But another learning opportunity arose: as part of an initiative by the American Embassy School, children living in the slums were offered the chance to spend every Thursday with the children inside the school. He made the most of these visits. It was by interacting with those students and teachers that I learnt English, says Das, who used to spend most of his Thursdays in the computer activity room.He also started working at a dhaba, which fetched him Rs50 and two meals a day. My summer holidays were also spent working as a cleaner and waiter there. Those Thursdays continued till Das completed his Class XII. By then, he had decided to pursue a career in computers. Aware of his ambitions, one of the teachers at the American Embassy School helped Das secure admission in a computer learning centre at South Extension. After completing a one-year diploma in hardware, Das started working with Mobile Creches as part of its technical support team. While working there for three years, he did a six-month course in Linux as well as completed his bachelors in arts through correspondence from Delhi University. Those three years taught me lot about what I wanted to do with my life. Things at home also improved; my mother was no longer a daily wager (she had a fixed job as a construction worker with a company and earned Rs1,500 a month), says Das, who earned Rs7,000 a month at Mobile Creches. Das then applied to a few multinational firms through a job portal. After six months he got a job and is currently a senior engineer at IBM in Noida. Had I refused to go to that makeshift crèche that day, my life wouldnt have been the same, he says. Like Das, Mobile Creches has helped shape many a childs life. Within each centre, there are three separate classrooms: a creche, for children birth to 3 years; the balwadi, for the 3 to 5 year olds; and NFE (bridge-course section), for children 6 and older. The approach is promotive in the sense that it takes care of the age-appropriate developmental needs of the children across the three sections  Creche (0-3), Balwadi (3-6) and Non-Formal Education (NFE) (6+). Mobile Creches emphasizes early stimulation, culturally appropriate learning and the acquisition of psycho-social skills in children. A specially designed curricula for each age group helps in early learning aiming at holistic development of the child.Mobile Creches 8-hour programme, six days a week, for birth to 12 year olds provides an integrated package of age-appropriate health, nutritional and educational interventions. The non-profit, which provides services to more than 3,000 children a day across the country with the help of volunteers, has adopted a nutrition programme to tackle malnutrition.With the focus on under-threes, this programme has a provision of fresh, wholesome food and a balanced mix of nutrients. Children are fed three times a daymilk is provided to them and fruits, vegetables, eggs, cereals and pulses constitute the daily diet, to ensure a minimum of 500 calories for each child as nutrition supplementation. A special diet is given to all children with weights below normal. The under-3 under-weight children are frequently fed and given a high protein ready-to-use-therapeutic-food made by Mobile Creches staff at every centre, explains Mridula Bajaj, executive director of Mobile Creches, whose sponsors include KPMG, DLF Foundation, Roselle, Oracle, Plan, Unitech and PNB Housing Finance.Talking about the importance of donations, Bajaj says, Of course, every drop counts and every single contribution, big or small, helps in the development of these children. Like everyone else, they too have the right to a better future. Beyond the monetary help, it also helps sensitize people and bring more people into the fold to work towards ensuring a better life for everyone.Das, who continues to live in Sanjay Niwas slum, too wants to help a child create a better future. For him, things are very different today from what they were 26 years ago. He earns Rs35,000 a month, is married and has a one-year-old daughter; his brother is a chef at a five-star hotel while his sister is married, and his mother now stays at home. If you can give, then give. It can change someones life.

0.13,"Mumbai: Avantha Group is likely to reject rival JK Papers offer to buy two paper factories in Maharashtra run by group company BILT Graphic Paper Products Ltd (BGPPL), three people aware of the development said.
				   
				In July, JK Paper had made a preliminary non-binding offer to acquire the two units at Ballarpur and Asthi in Maharashtra. The two factories make pulp, paper, paperboards and other paper products.Talks between the two firms have broken down because of  a disagreement over the valuation of the assets, the people aware of the discussions said, requesting anonymity.Although the exact value of JK Papers offer could not be immediately ascertained, the people cited above said that Avantha Group is no longer keen on the deal and has instead reached out to other potential investors to infuse working capital into BGPPL, which is going through a  serious cash crunch.In a filing to stock exchanges on 22 October, JK Paper had said that it had submitted a tentative offer and a draft term sheet for the units.While an Avantha Group spokesperson declined to comment on the story, emails sent to JK Paper on Friday remained unanswered until the time of going to press.Ballarpur Industries Ltd is the flagship company of the $4 billion Avantha Group and is one of Indias largest manufacturers of writing and printing paper. The company has six manufacturing units across India and till recently had the largest share of the domestic paper market. Both Ballarpur and Asthi units account for a large portion of the companys total production. In FY2016, the total paper production at Ballarpur was 247,649 million tonnes (mt), while Asthi produced 43,478 mt of paper.For the year ended 31 March, the company clocked net sales of Rs4,221 crore with an Ebitda of Rs732 crore, but paid an annual interest Rs463 crore. The company has been focusing on reducing debt through equity infusion or asset sales. In FY2015, it received an equity infusion of $100 million from International Finance Corp. in its step-down subsidiary BILT Paper BV, which was used to pre-pay the debt.According to India Ratings, BILT will need refinancing to fund its debt obligations, which have accumulated largely due to the underperformance of its Malaysian operations and a weakening demand for paper globally.However, the financial woes of Avantha Group are not limited to BILT alone. In 2014, Avantha Power sold its Korba power plant to Adani for Rs4,200 crore.

-0.29,"New York: AT&T is reportedly on the verge of announcing yet another massive merger, this time with $71 billion Time Warner. The goal here sort of makes sense: AT&T has the distribution network and it wants the content of Time Warner, parent of HBO, CNN and TBS.
				   
				But should AT&T follow through with a Time Warner purchase, its debt may balloon to levels that would put it at risk of a downgrade. Thats a significant concern for both AT&T, the second-largest US wireless carrier, and the broader $8 trillion corporate-bond market, considering that this company already has more than $120 billion of debt outstanding.Lets put that debt load into context. Its more than any other non-financial issuer in the US corporate bond market and more than four times as much as the biggest US junk-bond seller.At a minimum, any downgrade would dent the value of AT&Ts debt and send its borrowing costs higher. So what would it take for that to happen? Its current rating is BBB+ at S&P, three levels above junk, after being cut in 2015 in the wake of its $18.2 billion purchase of AWS-3 wireless spectrum licenses. AT&T has said it wants to reduce debt to regain its higher rating, but this deal very well could move it in the opposite direction.Lets say it were to pay all cash for the transaction and a 20% premium to Time Warners current market value, which has already risen amid the takeover speculation. AT&T would have to borrow billions of dollars in additional debt because it currently only has $7.2 billion of cash on its books. Net debt would then potentially surge to more than three times the combined Ebitda that AT&T and Time Warner are forecast to generate next year. That would be enough for a downgrade, according to a recent S&P Global Ratings report.AT&T is already nearing its leverage limits for its current rating at Moodys, so a material increase in debt over Ebitda will put it at risk for a downgrade at that credit-rating company.This is all hypothetical, of course, and if recent reports are correct that an agreement could be reached as soon as this weekend, well learn the actual deal terms soon enough. Bloomberg reported late Friday that AT&T is talking about buying Time Warner for about $110 a share, in a deal structured as half stock, half cash. While that wouldnt boost AT&Ts overall leverage ratio as much as if the carrier used all cash, it will still probably require its incurring more debt. That means the combined company needs to demonstrate its even more profitable than the two separate corporations or else face higher debt-to-income ratios, and a possible downgrade. The potential for this type of disruptive development happening matters greatly at a time when investors are pouring near-record amounts of cash into the US credit market. Just last year, a Moodys downgrade of Sprint, the biggest US junk-bond issuer, sparked a tumble in that wireless carriers debt and sent jitters through the high-yield market, showing how unsettling it can be when a dominant corporate-bond sellers rating is cut. And in Sprints case it was already junk-rated. Were AT&T to lose its investment-grade status, that could trigger more disruption as some bondholders cant hold high-yield debt and would be forced to sell. AT&T still has a fairly long way to fall before it loses its high-grade status, but a massive deal like this needs to be monitored closely by credit investors to make sure that its creating more value than its destroying.Investment-grade corporate bonds are poised for their best annual performance since 2009. Going forward, its idiosyncratic events like this that may drive whether the investments remain winners or turn into losers.

0.22,"Xiaomi Corp.s international chief Hugo Barra has quit after a turbulent four years during which the Chinese smartphone maker rose to the top of its home market before local rivals mimicked its model and dethroned the brand.
				   
				The former Google executive is returning to Silicon Valley after being hired with much fanfare in 2013 to be Xiaomis global face, becoming a fixture on the conference circuit and the up-and coming vendors main pitchman to foreign audiences. In a Facebook post Monday, Barra said it was time for him to return home to embark on a new adventure, without elaborating. Senior vice-president Xiang Wang will oversee global operations after Barra departs in February, after the Lunar New Year holidays.Barra was given the task of taking Xiaomi global, helping the company make inroads into India, where sales topped $1 billion for the first time in 2016. During his tenure, it briefly became Chinas biggest smartphone vendor by packing high-end components into inexpensive devices and building a vibrant online community of users. But local brands such as Oppo, Vivo and Huawei Technologies Co. rapidly copied its moves and developed more innovative competitive tactics.ALSO READ: Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 camera proves it isnt only about the megapixelsHugo was a key figure for Xiaomi in the early days because he helped overseas marketing, said Kitty Fok, managing director of IDC China. Barras departure is likely to have limited impact because Xiaomis position in India has stabilized and the task has shifted to growing market share, said Fok.His exit may indicate that Xiaomi is re-focusing on its home market, said Nicole Peng, an analyst at Canalys. Barra will be departing Beijinga city infamous for hazardous air pollutionjust as Xiaomi is struggling to find its footing at home. What Ive realized is that the last few years of living in such a singular environment have taken a huge toll on my life and started affecting my health, Barra wrote in his post. Seeing how much Ive left behind these past few years, it is clear to me that the time has come to return.Xiaomi was last valued at $45 billion in 2014, making it one of the worlds largest startups. It drew comparisons to Apple Inc. after doubling revenue that year and climbing to the top of the Chinese smartphone market . Its since struggled, missing its 2015 shipments target and falling behind Oppo and Huawei. The company is aiming for 100 billion yuan ($14.5 billion) in revenue this yearthe same target it had set as far back as 2015.Since that valuation in 2014, analysts have questioned its price tag given a sliding market position. In a memo posted on his WeChat account, billionaire co-founder Lei Jun said his company had tried to grow too rapidly in past years and missed opportunities.Its had more success in India, where it grew shipments 150% last year. Chinese brands account for 51% of Indias smartphone shipments in November, according to Counterpoint Research. Xiaomi is now counting on the country to drive its next phase of growth: it already assembles over three-quarters of its Indian smartphones in the country under the governments Make in India program.Yet despite that success, Xiaomis most important market by far remains its home country, where it may be preparing a comeback.Xiaomi realized the Chinese smartphone market will be their top priority, Peng said. India was the only shining point for Xiaomis overseas expansion over the years, and entering the US market will not be easy because the market is strongly held by Apple and Samsung.Xiaomi secured $1.1 billion in 2014 from investors including GIC Pte., All-Stars Investment Ltd and DST. Executives have since said repeatedly that it isnt on the hunt for financing, while deflecting speculation about an initial public offering. Apart from phones, the company also sells other types of electronic gadgets and appliances, from air purifiers to robot vacuums, made by what it calls its ecosystem-partners. Sales through such manufacturing and branding partners exceeded 15 billion yuan in 2016, Lei has said.As much as we would love to have Hugo stay with us in Beijing for a much longer time, we understand his personal challenges and wish him all the best in his future endeavors, co-founder Lin Bin wrote in a comment on Barras Facebook post.

				NPCI gave a clean chit to PhonePe, an app based on the unified payments interface (UPI), in a press statement released on Thursday evening after a review and discussions with ICICI Bank and Yes Bank Ltd, the banker to PhonePe. We would like to state that ICICI Bank has been advised to open UPI transactions immediately, NPCI said in the statement. We have also advised banks to adhere to the merchant on-boarding guidelines meticulously from the angle of interoperability of merchant app so that such disputes are avoided.NCPIs statement comes in response to concerns raised by ICICI Bank regarding transactions done on PhonePe.

ICICI Bank is one of the 10 promoters of NPCI and owned 7.47% of its shares as on 22 January 2016, according to the Watal committee report. In September, NPCI said it had broad-based its shareholding to include 46 new banks, but didnt specify what the new shareholding structure is.Yes Bank defended PhonePe in a statement to stock exchanges, stating that the app had complied with all the rules laid down by NCPI. All member banks who are offering UPI services have undergone exactly the same process and were allowed to go live only after complying with the same process, said Yes Bank.On Sunday, the lender said it had temporarily blocked transactions originating from PhonePe, pending the resolution of its concerns related to restrictive practices followed by the app. This entity is following restrictive practices allowing users to make payments with only its UPI handle, which is in contravention to the UPI guidelines of interoperability and choice that empowers a customer to choose any app to make payments through UPI, an ICICI spokesperson said.Flipkarts PhonePe crosses 10 million downloads on Google Play StorePhonePes co-founder and chief executive officer Sameer Nigam took to Twitter on 14 January to allege that ICICI was abruptly blocking its customers from using the app. Separately, in an open letter released on Tuesday, the company said that more than 20,000 UPI transactions amounting to more than Rs5 crore by value had failed after ICICI Banks action. We followed all the detailed guidelines and procedures laid down by NPCI for an app to go live on UPI. We went through over a 100+ use case test cases, detailed certification, vulnerability assessment, penetration testing and third-party application security testing, before NPCI gave us permission to go live. PhonePe has been live since August 2016 and none of these issues have been raised earlier, PhonePe clarified in its letter.PhonePe said in its letter it wasnt fully compliant with NPCIs Android Intent Calls guidelines, but added that the deadline for compliance was 31  January. It also pointed out that other UPI apps including Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) have not been updated to meet these guidelines. These guidelines state that when a payment is to be made, an app will initiate an intent call to other UPI apps present on a mobile device. PhonePe declined to comment on Thursday, saying it had not got any official communication from NPCI yet. This is the second instance of a commercial bank blocking transactions arising from non-bank mobile wallet and payment services companies. On 4 January, CNBC-TV18 reported that State Bank of India (SBI) had blocked net banking transactions with e-wallet companies, although it allowed customers to top up their mobile wallets with debit and credit cards. At that time, SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya had said that service was blocked because of security concerns.Since the government decided to ban Rs500 and Rs1,000 currency notes on 8 November, it has announced several measures to encourage cashless transactions including waiving off debit card transaction fees to offering discounts for using digital payments to buy fuel. The biggest beneficiaries of this move have been digital payment firms and wallet operators.

0.25,"Tokyo: It turns out Masayoshi Son isnt ready to retire after all.
				   
				Just a year ago, SoftBank Group Corp.s founder looked poised to fulfil his long-stated plan of stepping aside in his 60s. He had a global telecom empire, track record of spectacularly successful investments and a bright young successor. Instead, the 59-year-old edged aside his heir apparent, cut the biggest deal of his career yet and revealed on Friday his ambition to become one of the worlds most powerful investors.SoftBank said it is forming a new fund to put as much as $100 billion in the global technology industry in the next five years, partnering with Saudi Arabias public investment fund to find companies that will become influential in the future. By comparison, all the venture capital funds in the world disbursed a record $129.5 billion in funding in 2015, according to CB Insights.The man who once proclaimed his goal of creating the worlds most valuable company isnt hiding his ambition: Over the next decade, he aims to be the biggest investor in technology.In other words, Japans second-richest man isnt going anywhere. Son in 2014 brought in Nikesh Arora, luring the former Google executive with a pay package that rivaled those of Apple Inc.s Tim Cook and Walt Disney Co.s Bob Iger. He spent two years grooming him as a successor only to change his mind in June. A month later SoftBank announced plans for a $32 billion takeover of chip designer ARM Holdings Plc, Sons biggest bet to date and a wager on the future of interconnected devices.For some time, it seemed like Son has fatigued, considering retirement and bringing in Arora. It is pretty clear now that he is still full of zeal, said Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive officer of Myojo Asset Management Co.It is not yet clear who will call the shots at what is tentatively named SoftBank Vision Fund and the Japanese company declined to comment further, noting the fund had not yet closed. SoftBank named Rajeev Misra, its head of strategic finance, to lead the project.Son has made tens of billions in returns from investments in companies including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, Yahoo and Supercell Oy, and the new fund will likely pursue a similar strategy of backing technology companies at all stages. While Arora was SoftBanks president, the company had plans to put about $3 billion into startups each year.During his two year tenure, Arora spearheaded investments in Indian e-commerce provider Snapdeal.com, ride-hailing service Ola Cabs, real-estate website Housing.com and hotel-booking app Oyo Rooms. In October 2015, SoftBank led a $1 billion fund-raising round for US-based online lender Social Finance Inc.Over the next decade, the SoftBank Vision Fund will be the biggest investor in the technology sector, Son, chairman and chief executive officer of SoftBank, said in a statement Friday. We will further accelerate the information revolution by contributing to its development.The Saudi government will consider putting money into the fund and become the lead investment partner, SoftBank said in the statement. The Tokyo-based company, which will invest as much as $25 billion, signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with the Saudis, who may put in as much as $45 billion over the next five years. Other large global investors may participate to increase the pool to $100 billion.Also Read: SoftBank tech fund to invest up to $100 billion with Saudi ArabiaSoftBank said that the fund will be reflected on its consolidated financial statements, without giving further details. Its shares rose as much as 3.7% in Tokyo. The stock had gained 5.8% this year before today, compared with a 12% decline in the benchmark Nikkei 225 index.The company is stepping up investment activity even though it has more than $100 billion in debt. SoftBank has relied on borrowing and earnings from its domestic telecom operations to pay for investments in start-ups in India, US and China while balancing losses at its US subsidiary Sprint Corp. By tapping outside investors, Son will be able to cut more ambitious deals than he could on his own.Also Read: SoftBanks robot Pepper gets to work at Taiwan bankARM acquisition has brought Son to a limit of how much he can invest just with SoftBanks balance sheet, Myojos Kikuchi said.The companys high-speed Internet and wireless services in Japan generated 1.16 trillion yen ($11.2 billion) of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the fiscal year ended 31 March. SoftBank has 3.5 trillion yen of bonds maturing in the next five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Its conceivable that after capturing the core of the Internet of Things with ARM, Son will next look to other semiconductors, electronic components and software, said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute in Tokyo. SoftBank has a proven track record of investment successes.

-0.68,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond rose to 6.43% on Wednesday, from its previous close of 6.407%. While the finance minister was making the budget speech in Parliament, the bond yield actually dropped to 6.38%, but rose later.
				   
				The reason behind the drop was confusion about the exact size of the net government borrowing in fiscal 2018. Initially, the figure was quoted as Rs3.48 trillion against the current fiscal years Rs4.07 trillion. However, the comparison is not entirely correct as the 2018 figure does not take into account the buyback of bonds.ALSO READ | Budget 2017 gives clues about demonetisation deposits in banksAfter adjusting for buyback of bonds, the net borrowing programme in 2018 would be virtually unchangedRs3.48 trillion vs 3.47 trillion. And, without the adjustments, the comparable figures are Rs4.23 trillion in 2018 vs Rs4.07 trillion in 2017. The gross annual borrowing remains virtually unchanged at around Rs5.8 trillion. Once the mathematics was clear to the market, bond yields rose.It could be a knee-jerk reaction as ultimately, the market cannot ignore the good newsthe government is determined to contain the fiscal deficit at 3.2% of Indias gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018. This has also given rise to the hope of a rate cut in the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBI) next monetary policy on 8 February.Indeed, the fiscal discipline brightens the chances for a rate cut next week but I would still say its not a given as yetthe chance of a rate cut next week is 50:50. There could be a rate cut in coming months but it may or may not materialize next week.ALSO READ | A remarkably restrained Union budget, going by the numbersApart from the containment of fiscal deficit at 3.2% of GDP, the other factor that could influence the Monetary Policy Committee (which will have a new memberdeputy governor in charge of monetary policy Viral Acharya) that takes the call on interest rate is the drop in retail inflation to 3.41% in December from 3.63% in the previous month and 5.61% a year ago.Food inflation, which accounts for more than half of the consumer price index or CPI basket, is the driving factor and we may not see inflation going down further from here. The external factors which prevented RBI from going in for a rate cut in December have worsened since then and the impact of the so-called demonetisation is still not clear.In other words, the reasons cited by the six-member MPC for RBI for deciding against a rate cut in December are very much there and it can once again refrain from cutting the rate at its next meeting.At the first meeting of MPC in October, RBI brought down its policy rate to 6.25%.ALSO READ | Union Budget 2017: Key highlights and themesThe other reason behind a likely decision against any rate cut could be the liquidity-driven monetary transmission. Flooded with money post-demonetization, some of the banks have pared their benchmark rates by as much as 90 basis points in January. One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. Much of the money that flowed into the banking system in November and December is in the form of low-cost current and savings accounts. Banks do not pay any interest on current accounts and most pay 4% on savings accounts. With no sign of corporate credit picking up, banks have cut their loan rates for mortgages aggressively.It is for certain though that RBI will continue with its accommodative monetary policy stance. And, of course, there could be a surprise in the form of a rate cutlike the market experience in December when the MPC chose not to go for a rate cut against the consensus estimate.Tamal Bandyopadhyay, consulting editor at Mint, is adviser to Bandhan Bank.

				Net profit stood at Rs2,441.82 crore, as against Rs3,018.13 crore a year earlier, marginally lower than estimates. According to a Bloomberg poll of 20 analysts, the bank was expected to post a net profit of Rs2,466.7 crore for the quarter.The earnings are in line with expectations, said Siddharth Purohit, senior research analyst with brokerage firm Angel Broking Ltd. Earnings will remain muted for next couple of quarters.ICICI Bank shares fell 0.7% to Rs268.95 on Tuesday, paring this years gains to 5.4%.

The S&P BSE Bankex Index has gained 7.5% this year.The lenders gross bad loans ballooned to Rs37,716. 73 crore at the end of December, rising 17.21% from the quarter ago. As a percentage of total loans, gross bad loans stood at 7.9% at the end of December, up from 6.82% at the end of the previous quarter. Bad loans net of provisions were 4.35% of advances. During the three months ended December, Rs 7057 crore worth of fresh loans turned bad, lower than the previous two quarters. About 40% of these were from a so-called watchlist the bank released in March. ICICI Banks managing director and chief executive officer Chanda Kochchar said the watch list, which includes sub-investment grade loans given to troubled sectors, declined to Rs.27,536 crore at the end of December from Rs 44,065 crore nine months earlier. Around Rs 12,057 crore worth of loans from the watch list went bad and Rs 4165 crore worth of loans were resolved during the last nine months.Rise in bad loans had a dampening effect on net interest income in the quarter, Hatim Broachwala, an analyst at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities told Bloomberg. The banks ability to prevent any further deterioration in asset quality in the slowing economy is going to be the key to profit growth in coming quarters.Net interest income (NII), or the core income a bank earns by giving loans, fell by 1.64% to Rs5,363.35 crore as loan growth slowed owing to the effects of demonetisation and the rise in bad loans.At the end of December, ICICI Banks advances rose 5.21% to Rs4.57 trillion.To be sure, ICICI Bank is not the only bank bearing the brunt of rising bad loans and slowing advances. Earlier in January, HDFC Bank Ltd reported its weakest quarterly profit growth in at least 20 years. Rival Axis Bank Ltd said net profit for the December quarter fell 73.4% while its gross bad loans ratio jumped by 1 percentage point over the last three months.It is very difficult to give any guidance on resolution of stressed assets as there are too many moving parts involved, Kochhar said on a conference call with reporters. Our endeavour is to resolve as much as we can in this year itself.ICICI Banks non-interest income fell 6.61% from a year ago to Rs 3938. 31 crore. However, this was largely because the bank booked a one-time income of Rs 1243 crore on sale of shareholding in ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co Ltd in the December 2015 quarter.

0.55,"Mumbai: With the government having de-legalized Rs500 and Rs1,000 bank notes, there is mounting interest in electronic payment mechanisms, with mobile payment firms Paytm, Ola Money and Mobikwik reporting increased downloads of their apps.
				   
				The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), on its part, has also been goading people to use electronic modes of payments.Such usage will alleviate pressure on the physical currency and also enhance the experience of living in the digital world, RBI had said on Saturday.Is India ready to go fully cashless then? The short answer is no. The long answer, is slightly more nuanced, but still a no. A look at the cashless payment infrastructure tell us why this is so.As of 30 September, the number of point of sale (PoS) devices, which accepted debit and credit cards as modes of payments at merchant outlets, was only 1.49 million, RBIs monthly bulletin shows. Still, the number is higher than the 1.38 million reported on 31 March. These outlets include railway stations, airports, hospital counters and supermarkets.In comparison, Indians had nearly 730 million debit cards and 27 million credit cards at September end. It isnt clear, however, how many people have more than one card.These debit cards in the system also include about 200 million RuPay cards linked to over 250 million bank accounts under the Prime Ministers Jan Dhan Yojana. So far, about 24% of Jan Dhan accounts have zero balance, as reported by the financial inclusion movements website. And, according to a 13 September report by The Indian Express, 18 public sector banks and their 16 regional rural subsidiaries had just over 10 million accounts with only Rs1 in them, as bankers try to cut down the number of zero balance accounts under them.An even better indicator would be the money that is spent at these terminals. According to RBI data, people used debit cards to make nearly 1.2 billion transactions worth Rs1.6 trillion across India in FY16.While the transactions and amount may seem high, India also used debit cards to make over 8 billion transactions worth Rs 25.37 trillion at automated teller machines (ATMs) during that period. These were mostly cash withdrawals and some transfers made to other accounts and credit card bills.Credit cards recorded 785 million transactions on PoS terminals, where an amount of over Rs2.4 trillion was spent. It is clear then that India is largely using its plastic cards to withdraw cash, which it spends later.Mobile wallets, where services such as Paytm, Mobikwik and Ola Money offer ease of transaction to customers are still in the starting phase of adoption as only around one-fifth of Indias population has a smartphone where these services can be used. According to GSMA Intelligence, a mobile operator database, there were about 275 million smartphones in India as of June.RBIs monthly bulletin points out mobile wallets were used to make 604 million transactions in FY16 by customers who spent about Rs20.6 billion. Mobile bankingor transactions done via applications provided by banks to transfer money, pay utility bills and check balancesrecorded 390 million transactions worth over Rs4 trillion. Unified Payments Interface (UPI), the National Payments Corporation of Indias (NPCIs) ambitious payments interface which enables person-to-person transactions without the need to exchange sensitive bank account information is yet to fully take off. While NPCI has been able to sign up 26 banks to the UPI platform, which went live in August, the number of downloads and transactions hasnt picked up. Only about 20-25% of all transactions that happen in India are cashless. With this demonetization drive, we should see this rising and people opting for mobile wallets more. However, it is true the infrastructure for acceptance is still an issue that needs to be overcome. Possibly, this would be the time for improving that, said Karthik Srinivasan, senior vice-president, ICRA Ltd.Another factor that works against cashless transactions is the perceived security problems. Last month, details of about 32 million cards were likely to have been compromised due to a security breach in an ATM network. This led to State Bank of India (SBI) issuing 600,000 new cards to customers who could have been victims of this.

				Greenko, backed by the sovereign wealth funds of Abu Dhabi and Singapore, took over SunEdison sites in September that include ones with 440 MW of capacity already operating and another 1,200 MW of projects still under development, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media. The assets are valued at about $500 million, one of the people said.The sale ends the foray of SunEdison, once the worlds biggest renewable energy company, into the second-most-populous nation. It sets Greenko up to profit from Prime Narendra Modis goal of boosting clean energy capacity to 175 GW by 2022.SunEdison, which filed for bankruptcy protection in April, listed $16.1 billion of debt in court filings, making it the biggest US bankruptcy of 2016. The year before, it won the right to build 500 MW of solar power in Andhra Pradesh with a record low bid of Rs4.63 kilowatt-hour.Winding downThat project will now be completed by Greenko by 31 March, according to, M.

In October, Fitch Ratings put the enterprise value of the transaction, thought at the time to involve about 390 MW of operational assets, at $392 million.While the bulk of the projects have been bought by Greenko, some have gone to Terraform Global Inc., which said in September that it wouldnt hinder the sale of assets in India.

				In any case, investors dont seem overly concerned about the Donald Trump presidency. Of course, its too early to say how things will play out. Trump will assume office only in January, and its not clear if the rhetoric during campaigning will translate into drastic changes in regulations. Also read: Donald Trump brings uncertainties for IndiaEven so, investors should note that the risks of a Trump presidency go far beyond just visas. For instance, Trump may repeal Obamacare and this can impact growth for the sector. Healthcare has been the fastest growing segment for Indian IT. A big driver of growth in healthcare has been regulations such as Obamacare and if that is scrapped, there could be a negative impact on demand, analysts at Nomura Research wrote in a note to clients. They add that if Trumps statements about reducing wasteful and unnecessary regulations actually translate into fewer regulations, the resultant cutback in regulatory and compliance-related spending by banking and financial services clients will hit revenues for the IT sector in the near term. From a shorter-term perspective, a cut back in regulatory and compliance spending with Mr Trump looking to put a moratorium on further regulations in the banking space might be a negative for Indian IT companies that derive ~35-40% of revenues from this vertical, they said in the note. Of course, if these measures result in better growth for the banking and financial services industry in the US, it will be a long-term positive for Indian IT as well. Risks related to new immigration rules are not trivial either. Tighter rules could result in an increase in the minimum wages for H-1B visas and higher visa costs, which would impact margins materially. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities pointed out in a recent note that the Democrats-founded immigration reform bill of 2013, if passed, would have impacted Indian ITs earnings anywhere between 12% and 20%. The impact will vary depending on profit margins of a company. In recent years, Indian IT firms have increased the proportion of local hires and on-site salaries have been raised as well. As such, the impact of tighter immigration rules may not be as severe as a few years ago.

0.03,"Mumbai: Clean energy companies and their investors are worried about rising instances of state power distribution utilities (discoms) unplugging their generating capacity from the grid and delaying both payments and the signing of power purchase agreements (PPAs). 
				   
				Two of Indias largest renewable energy companies, ReNew Power Ventures Pvt. Ltd and Tata Power Renewable Energy Ltd (TPREL), a subsidiary of Tata Power Co. Ltd, have been hit by such unplugging, also called back-down at their plants in multiple states, company officials said. Projects of other companies including Adani Green Energy Ltd and Hero Future Energies have also been hurt due to back-down and delays in signing PPAs, they added. Some states resort to backing down wind and solar projects, jeopardizing investments already made in the projects, said Rahul Shah, chief executive of TPREL. Discoms in Maharashtra, Tamilnadu, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have also been delaying payments to generators of wind and solar power by as much as 8-10 months, which puts their cash flows under tremendous pressure. These are negative signals for developers and investors who are evaluating the Indian market for investment in new renewable energy capacity, Shah said.According to ReNew Powers estimates, discoms in Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh owe wind energy producers over Rs4000 crore in payments. A ReNew spokesperson said about 500 megawatt (MW) of its solar capacity and a smaller size of wind capacity is stranded in Jharkhand due to delays in signing PPAs.A check of awarded projects shows 1200 MW of solar capacity of ReNew Power, Adani Power and ACME Solar and about 600 MW of wind capacity is stuck for the lack of PPAs in Jharkhand. Adani Power and Hero Future did not respond to emails seeking comment. Many discoms are in poor financial shape and have started going back on their commitment to sign PPAs with solar power producers, multiple people in the renewables business said. In solar projects, which are won through reverse bidding process, a PPA is signed ahead of completion of the project, usually for a period of 25 years. A back-down can happen due to availability of cheaper power elsewhere, lack of transmission infrastructure, absence of demand, or inability of the grid to buy power. Grids usually reserve the right to unplug power because of the variations in the amount of power generated. This practice, called power back-down, leads to losses of billions of units of green power.Several companies have filed petitions against a state utility in Rajasthan on account of this, an official of Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission said on condition of anonymity. Investors are losing confidence, said Seema Changlani, director of Beont Capital, which helps Indian companies set up projects and attract new investments. At times, the grid refuses to purchase renewable power in favour of cheaper thermal power. Investors finance projects on the basis of PPAs and absence of PPAs by discoms can hurt IRRs of these projects.Back-down and delay in payments have become a chronic problem, Dilip Nigam, adviser, ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE) said on the sidelines of an event in Mumbai on Wednesday. Discoms are backing down on renewable energy in the name of security of the grid and we have been taking up the issue separately. Renewable energy should have a must-run status. India has a total wind capacity of 27.4 gigawatt (GW) and solar capacity of about 9 GW. It has set itself the target of adding 100 GW of solar and 60 GW of wind capacity by 2022.The government has set a renewable purchase obligation target for discoms, but this target is not being met. This raises concerns over rising solar capacity and ability of the discoms to buy all of it. This (problem) is becoming bigger by the day, Vinay Rustagi, managing director, renewable energy focused consultancy Bridge to India said.The MNRE wrote to the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission in August highlighting the issue of back-downs. Tarun Kapoor, joint secretary, MNRE wrote in that letter that if any backing down has to be done, thermal power projects should be asked to back down so that some fuel is saved. This (loss of energy from backing down) can make solar power unattractive particularly when projects are being allotted through competitive bidding and tariffs have come down drastically, he wrote. They should be paid full tariff if they are forced to back down in rare cases.Solar energy tariffs have fallen from Rs15 over four years ago to below Rs5 per unit over the past 12 months, in part due to aggressive bidding in reverse auctions.

				Ostro Energy will acquire 49% stake in Prathamesh Solarfarms Ltd, a special purpose vehicle (SPV) set up by Suzlon for executing the project, and will have the option to acquire the remaining 51% in future, Suzlon said in a statement. Suzlon will still be responsible for building the project and operation and maintenance services for a period of 25 years.The project, which is expected to be completed this fiscal year, is a part of the 210 MW of solar projects that Suzlon had won in Telangana through a competitive bidding process last year. Suzlon had in January announced its official entry into the solar energy market, receiving letters of interest (LoI) for the 210 MW projects that it won in Telangana in August 2015.

0.48,"With the addition of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Code, the Indian lending system has gotten teeth in dealing with stressed borrowers and a difficult macroeconomic situation. As the Indian banking system stares at a Rs6.3 trillion bad loan pile, with more being added almost every quarter, a legal stress resolution mechanism is the need of the hour.
				   
				As some of the finer points of the Code get clarified, before it takes effect at the end of the year, there is speculation around how it will be implemented in a market like India, which is famously known for its slow resolution rate.At a panel discussion at the Mint conference on Bankruptcy ActImpact of the new law on the banking landscape, held on 24 October, industry professionals, law professionals and stressed asset consultants came together to discuss the Code, and the opportunities and challenges associated with it. As divorce is important for marriage, I think insolvency resolution is important for investments, whether Indian or foreign capital, said Cyril Suresh Shroff, managing partner at Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas. According to Shroff, the impact of the bankruptcy code will be widely positive, leading to a better management of stressed companies in India. M.R. Umarji, a member of the Bankruptcy Law Committee set up by government, believes that while the code bestows significant powers on the legal system to deal with stressed companies, the intended effect is that there will be better financial discipline among companies, which will work to ensure that all their creditors are paid on time. Abizer Diwanji, partner and national leader, financial services and restructuring services, EY India, said, About 70% of our banking business is government-led. They have restraints in the way that they can make rational decisions in a timely manner. The law says that in 270 days there has to be a decision or the company goes into liquidation, but that does not mean that in 270 days there will be a rational decision.Rashesh Shah, chairman and chief executive officer at Edelweiss Finance, is of the view that the lending system in India has entered into yet another zone of conflict between the lenders and the borrowers. According to him, back in the late 80s and early 90s, when infrastructure lenders were faced with high non-performing assets (NPAs), they would convert a significant chunk of their debt into equity and then make huge returns a few years later. Back then, the lenders won the tug of war.In the era of corporate debt restructuring (CDR) and other debt recast mechanisms, lenders have ended up taking haircuts while the equity holders didnt feel much of the pinch. Shah believes that the equity holders or the borrowers had won that round. With the bankruptcy code coming into the picture, the powers have once again come into the hands of lenders as they are far above equity holders in the payout structure that the code mandates in a liquidation situation, said Shah.The bark is more important than the bite. As a practitioner I would never like to get into a situation of resolution under this Act, but I think it is desirable that we would be outside this or before this is invoked, said Vishakha Mulye, executive director, ICICI Bank.As a system, Mulye said, everyone must work together to demonstrate that resolution and liquidation can be done in an effective and efficient manner, if there has to be a future for the bankruptcy code. However, not everyone is convinced that India has done enough to move the stressed asset situation in the right direction.Anurag Das, founder and managing partner at Rain Tree Capital Singapore, is measured in his optimism. Some of the best practices around the world need to come to this market too, he said, adding that a very hands-on approach has to be taken to ensure that a turnaround takes place.According to Das, even though his optimism is measured, the expectation is that in about five years from now, there will be a number of Indian stressed companies where turnaround will take place because of the code.Some flaws in the way that the code is drafted include the fact that lenders too are held at gunpoint in case the resolution plan does not get finalised in the time assigned by the code, according to Rajendra Chitale, managing partner, MP Chitale & Associates.There should be a provision to get extensions if needed, Chitale said, adding that these flaws might have been unintended, but are part of the way bankruptcy play out in the future. Another issue, Chitale points out, is that the law assumes that the resolution plan that is being implemented in the stressed company will work out in the first attempt.  This may lead to an increase in the number of credible assets in the economy which may go into wind-up. Having said that, Chitale believes that the bankruptcy code is a landmark legislation which can change the way business is done in India.",2016-11-02,Ab3yPyjl9xhcHsOJtF2GeK,"At the Mint conference on the Bankruptcy Act, industry professionals, law professionals and stressed asset consultants discuss opportunities and challenges",00:51,Measuring the impact of the Bankruptcy Act

				Winning developers in Jharkhand state are still waiting to sign power purchase agreements almost a year after the tender. In March, Jharkhand awarded contracts to build 1.2 gigawatts (GW) of solar. The states power retailer, Jharkhand Bijli Vitran Nigam Ltd, was supposed to sign the power purchase agreements in May 2016.We have asked for financial assistance of a few hundred crore rupees from the states finance department and are awaiting their response, said R.K. Srivastava, chief secretary of the energy department in the state of Jharkhand.The delay underscores the threat from financially strapped state power retailers to Prime Minister Narendra Modis ambitious renewable energy goals. State-owned power retailers in India had combined losses of Rs3.84 trillion as of March 2015, according to a report by KPMG.Jharkhand Bijlis managing director, Rahul Kumar Purwar, couldnt be reached for comment.ReNew Power Ventures Pvt. Ltd, which is majority owned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. scooped up 522 MW in the March auction. ReNews other investors include the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the Global Environment Fund.Other winners included Suzlon Energy Ltd, OPG Power Ventures Plc, Acme Group, Adani Enterprises Ltd and SunEdison Inc.A Suzlon spokesperson was unavailable for comment. An email sent to the Adani Group wasnt returned. OPG Power executives couldnt be reached. In an email, ReNew Power executives declined to comment.Solar auctionHow much of the solar capacity awarded in Marchs tender eventually gets built depends on whether the government provides the backing, Srivastava said.Tariffs awarded in the auction ranged from Rs5.08 to Rs7.90 per kilowatt-hour depending on the size of the project, all of which were supposed to become operational between May and November this year.There is a huge difference between the average tariff of nearly Rs4.3 a unit, at which the discom buys power, and the rates quoted for solar energy in the auction last year, Srivastava said in a phone interview, referring to the term used to identify electricity distribution companies in India.The poor financial health of the countrys power retailers has been identified as one of the biggest hurdles to Modis climate pledge to install 175 GW of renewable capacity by 2022.Those losses mean discoms cant buy more electricity to satisfy expected demand whether clean or conventional, nor can they add more customers. That ultimately leaves latent power demand unmet.Several domestic and overseas clean energy companies have said they havent received payments for the electricity they generate for more than 10 months, racking up deficits of several hundred million dollars that may put the countrys green power ambitions at risk.Jharkhands state discom has liabilities of Rs6,400 crore, according to government data. As marquee investors find themselves at risk, the central government has asked for a quick resolution of the matter.The government faces embarrassment should the situation in Jharkhand not be resolved, according to a senior official at the ministry of new and renewable energy who requested anonymity because he isnt authorized to speak to the media.

				That query posed by Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev at the Isha Foundations annual leadership workshop for entrepreneurs resonated with many attendees, including Deepak Satwalekar, the former managing director and chief executive officer of HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. Ltd.It makes you think and reflect on what your priorities should be. Dont go around trying to fix the world. Fix yourself first, and the rest will follow, said Satwalekar, who has been a resource leader at the annual event since it first started five years ago with the aim of helping small businesses scale up.This year, INSIGHT: The DNA of Success programme, led by Sadhguru, will take place from 24 to 27 November and will feature State Bank of India chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya, Piramal Group and Shriram Group Chairman Ajay Piramal, former Kellogg and INSEAD dean Dipak Jain, former Britannia Industries Ltd MD Vinita Bali, TeamIndus fleet commander Rahul Narayan, Shoppers Stop Ltd non-executive vice-chairman B.S. Nagesh, and textiles minister Smriti Zubin Irani. Mint is a partner of the programme.So what draws so many corporate leaders, academics and entrepreneurs to the event held every year at the Coimbatore headquarters of Sadhgurus Isha Foundation?You will learn several things that you were not taught in management school or at work, and get a chance to be inspired by Sadhguru, said Shanker Annaswamy, the former MD of IBM India Pvt. Ltd.For instance, the workshop helped Sapan Jain summon the courage to leave his corporate job at International Business Machines Corp. and start reverse logistics service provider Blubirch, and alter his entire approach towards problem-solving. It taught him to focus on the variables he could control rather than obsessing over the potential consequences of a situation, ranging from the departure of a key employee to a promised investment falling through.All of us read business books. All of us hear business leaders. Sometimes, (all of that) beyond a point can get vegetative and monotonous. When you hear a different perspective which is still very pragmatic and practical (such as Sadhgurus), it makes a lot of sense, Jain said.Vikash Agrawal, the promoter of power plant equipment maker Hi-Tech Systems & Services Ltd. (HTSSL), agreed.The insights he gleaned there have become a kind of another management book for me, said Agrawal, who is planning to attend the event yet again this year.Agarwal has made sure to implement some of the business lessons he learned at the event, including the fail early concept and the 90-day rule proposed by BRICS Bank chief K.V. Kamath in a bid to set a limit on the time a company should pilot a new idea before moving on.This is exactly why management gurus such as Ram Charan recommend the workshop.The single most reason (that makes this workshop unique) is that the learning is done from the practitioners, Charan said.The resource leaders, who act as informal mentors to entrepreneurs at the event, come from diverse backgrounds and sectors, making it almost a certainty that a participant will find someone he or she will be able to relate with personally and professionally, former attendees said.Also, unlike years past, this years event will include more structured modules on specific topics and include more women and people from the manufacturing, said programme facilitator Nagesh.For Nagesh, the biggest challenge is to make the workshop equally appealing to somebody whose companys sales are Rs10 crore and another who runs a Rs1,000 crore firm. That said, he believes the programme is fairly unique because of the fact that the spiritual part is actually integrated into it. The events faculty chair, Dipak Jain, too has been fascinated by Sadhgurus focus on inner engineering.First you have to be a better person before you start a better business or a better society, Jain said.The programme has proved to be an eye opener for not just the entrepreneurs but also for those who have been past speakers or mentors.Everyone has their own struggle and sometimes understanding how others dealt with their own challenges, can give us the inspiration to move forward, said Dr. Reddys Laboratories Ltd co-chairman and CEO G.V. Prasad.Prasad encouraged entrepreneurs to practise a mantra he learned from Sadhguru that those who want to scale up must learn to let go of their current state without fear and move to a higher plane, akin to trapeze artists, while Satwalekar urged them to stay hungry for knowledge, learn to prioritise, surround themselves with smarter people and not be afraid of failure.For many, like Varda Shine, the former CEO of De Beers Diamond Trading Co, the main draw of the program is Sadhguru, whose way of looking at leadership and success is much wider than any other business learning.And former participants across the board have a simple piece of advice for anyone looking to attend the event this year.As Anupal Banerjee, senior vice president  human resources, Viacom18 Media Pvt.

An email sent to the Edelweiss spokesperson on Tuesday did not elicit any response.In one of the largest buyouts in the multiplex business, Carnival acquired Big Cinemas, a division of Anil Ambanis Reliance MediaWorks Ltd, for around Rs700 crore in December 2014.Carnival, which bought 252 screens of Big Cinemas, had added 30 screens with the acquisition of HDIL Broadway for Rs110 crore in January 2014. In 2015, Carnival made its third acquisition by buying out Stargaze Entertainment Pvt. Ltd from a unit of Mukesh Ambani-controlled Network18 Media and Investments Ltd for an undisclosed amount, giving it 30 additional screens.The company had drawn up aggressive plans to add more screens and also refurbish the existing ones.

Aided by strong growth in the US, sales increased by a healthy 16.5% but net profit grew just 3.5% and missed analysts estimates as high expenses and finance costs crimped earnings.
				   
				Nevertheless, there are two factors aiding the stock. One is the product pipeline. Business in the US is gaining traction. The company received approvals for 11 products in the first half of the current fiscal year. Last quarter it filed applications for two generic drugs and plans to do more in coming months. In India, another large market for Glenmark, it made two major product launches and is said to be seeing good sales.The new drugs along with the forthcoming launch of a generic version of a patented cholesterol lowering pill will result in strong performance in the coming quarters, Glenn Saldanha, chairman and managing director of Glenmark, told CNBC-TV18.The second factor is the financial deleveraging plan. A cholesterol lowering drug, gZetia, scheduled for launch in December, will have sales exclusivity for the company. It is a blockbuster drug (with annual sales of more than $1 billion) and is likely to have disproportionate impact on Glenmarks earnings in the next three quarters at least. The gZetia launch scheduled in H2 FY2017 will give a big fillip to sales and profitability, Sharekhan Ltd said in a note.Glenmark plans to use earnings from this drug to lower debt, a legacy problem that has weighed on its return ratios and stock valuations. The management aims to bring down the net debt-to-Ebitda ratio from 2.2 times last fiscal year to 1.25 times. Even otherwise, the management expects the profitability in the core business to improve due to new products. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.Analysts estimate the cholesterol lowering drug and recently-raised funds to help cut debt by $150-200 million (Rs1,000-1,334 crore) by the end of the current fiscal year or early next year.If things progress as planned, then a niggling worry about the companys balance sheet will be addressed, which will bring down finance costs and help expand valuation of the stock, which is trading at a discount to sector average valuations. According to HDFC Securities Ltd, the Glenmark stock, up 10% in the last six months, reflects some of the positives.A better-than-expected earnings boost from the forthcoming cholesterol drug launch can lead to surprise returns, adds HDFC Securities.

The company had reported exceptional expense of Rs42.12 crore in the third quarter of fiscal 2015-16. We have delivered a strong net sales growth of 6 per cent despite the subdued economic environment in the third quarter due to demonetisation... we have been able to manage through this period better than our initial expectations, USL chief executive officer Anand Kripalu said. This growth was underpinned by the firms continued focus on premiumisation and increased investments in its power brands, he added. In line with our strategy to selectively participate in the popular segment we have entered into agreements to franchise selected popular brands in Andhra Pradesh, Puducherry, Goa, Andaman and Nicobar and Kerala effective from January. These changes were made to further improve our operating model and focus our business on the biggest growth opportunities.

0.82,"After United Spirits Ltd (USL) announced its June quarter results, its share fell, dropping from Rs.3,788 to around Rs.3,000. The September quarter results got a different reception, with its share rising sharply; its now back to Rs.3,512.20. What explains this enthusiasm?
				   
				An improvement in profitability is the main reason. Operating profit not only increased by 36.1% over a year ago, but also by 57.3% sequentially. That contributed to a 3.3 percentage point increase in profit margin over a year ago. Some of this was the result of USL desisting from making payments under related party agreements. This is a legacy issue and these payments were stopped from November 2014 after shareholders voted against them.But better margins are also partly attributable to volume growth and a better mix. The companys mass-market brands saw volumes decline by 5% in the first half, over a year ago. But its higher-end brands saw volumes grow by 7%. In the first quarter, growth in this segment was 5.7%. Some of this improvement is explained by the September quarter being the first full quarter when USL had sales from Diageo Plcs brands. The higher-end category is now nearly 40% of total volumes, up three percentage points over a year ago.The second half of FY16 may not see margins increase as much, due to a base effect since related party payments stopped from November. But even if margins are maintained at current levels, they are healthy, and sales growth and mix can take over to drive growth.Mass-market volumes were hit by a temporary disruption in Karnataka. This should pick up in future quarters. But even then, USL is targeting low single-digit growth from this segment. It wants double-digit growth from the higher-end brands. The objective is to have a good mix of healthy sales growth and good profitability levels.Current trends do seem encouraging. The management is also implementing a plan to raise productivity, which if successful, should lead to better margins in the longer run. Selling non-core assets is also likely to release more funds, which can be used to reduce debt.Last year, both the management and investors were distracted by governance-related issues. Those issues havent been resolved completely, but are being tackled and look less threatening.

-0.03,"New Delhi: Just a day after all charges framed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against former telecom minister Dayanidhi Maran and his brother Kalanithi Maran were dropped, in the Aircel-Maxis case, liquor baron Vijay Mallya lashed out against the CBI claiming that all charges against him were false and misconceived.
				   
				In a series of tweets by Mallya on Friday morning, he claimed that the CBI made such a great drama accusing the Marans and putting them to great harm. What finally happened? Did truth prevail or CBI prevail? I am shocked at CBI allegations. All false and misconceived to say the least. What do a bunch of elite police know about business and economics?Mallya also went on to claim that he was being made a pawn in a political game. He said, Media happily being used as the pitch. I am the football. Two fiercely competitive teams National Democratic Alliance (NDA) versus United Progressive Alliance (UPA) playing. Unfortunately there are no referees. (sic)The Congress was quick to respond to Mallyas claims, stating that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was shielding him.The BJP started by making Mallya a Rajya Sabha MP. In 2015 the CBI had issued a lookout notice in 2015, which has now been withdrawn from all airports. Last year, before Mallya left, he had also met a senior cabinet minister who had tipped him off and helped him leave, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala told Mint.Surjewala also stated that Union finance minister Arun Jaitleys budget speech which aimed at cracking down on black money launderers was a complete farce, with the party being completely dishonest in its approach towards cracking down on Mallya.Under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) an offenders assets can be confiscated and attached. Why has that not been done? The FMs speech means nothing if the party is being dishonest when it comes to prosecuting the ilk of Mallya and Lalit Modi. The party helped Mallya escape to foreign shores, where he gets money in his offshore account with the party complicit in this, Surjewala added.The BJP, however, remained silent on the matter.The party will not comment on any of these allegations or issues while the Parliament is in session. It is against legislation to comment on matters which may come up in Parliament and then we will take a call on this, said a senior BJP leader, requesting anonymity.Late on Thursday night, Mallya also alleged that the CBI was systematically framing him in a conspiracy.The CBI selectively releasing e-mails to media which are being taken out of context and distorted to make allegations against me and UPA regime, he wrote on Twitter.The CBI however, told Mint that this was a desperate attempt by Mallya to wade out of the airtight charges that had been made against him.Charges have been filed and we have now set the ball rolling for his extradition. If Vijay Mallya is not to blame, then why did he run away from the country? We are confident that the United Kingdom will extradite him because we have a very strong case against him.

0.4,"New York/Seattle: Its time for Jorge Paulo Lemann to get back in the hunt.
				   
				That, anyway, is the word inside the food industry, where the Brazilian billionaire has been doing blockbuster deals roughly every two years. In 2013, he persuaded Warren Buffett to team up on H.J. Heinz. Then, in 2015, the duo orchestrated the $55 billion merger of Heinz and Kraft Foods.Its logical that this would be the year, said David Palmer, a food industry analyst at RBC Capital.The talk has traders on edge. Last month, a story in a little-known Swiss magazine, resurfacing well-worn speculation about Lemanns plan to buy Mondelez with Buffett, spurred an immediate pop in the US snack giants shares. (They soared 28% in just a few minutes.) So far, no deal has been announced. Regardless, the question of what Lemann might go after in 2017 has just about everyone grasping for leads. Besides Mondelez, some other names include General Mills, Kellogg and Campbell Soup.There is even talk that Buffetts beloved Coca-Cola, a prospect that some dismissed as fantasy, could be in play.All the attention goes to show just how much the 77-year-old Lemann has reshaped and influenced the global food and beverage industry. In the past decade, Lemann and his Brazilian partners at 3G Capital have made their names with a run of splashy deals, including Anheuser-Busch and Burger King, and a singular vision of hacking away costs at every turn.Modus OperandiHis team has been so effective at boosting profits that companies have had to change how they do businessor risk becoming targets themselves. Some industry insiders have criticized 3Gs methods as draconian and short-sighted, and suggest the constant need for acquisitions reflects the fact that cost cuts alone cant boost sales.At Mondelez, chief executive officer Irene Rosenfeld says a more balanced approach to improving margins will ultimately lead to bigger returns for shareholders.ALSO READ | Warren Buffett says he supports Donald Trumps cabinet overwhelminglyWeve been walking and chewing gum at the same time, Rosenfeld said. She declined to discuss whether the maker of Cadbury and Oreos, a long-rumored target for 3G, has been approached about combining with Kraft Heinz.Nevertheless, Lemann has made a believer out of Buffett, widely recognized as one of savviest and most successful investors in the world.With Buffett, whos sitting on an $85 billion cash hoard, the strategy is simple. Buffett ponies up the money to help finance the acquisitions and Lemanns team does the dirty work. Invariably, that means firing workers, closing factories and paring unnecessary expenses.When all the savings are wrung out, 3G looks for the next target. And theres no shortage of options in the packaged-food industry, which is struggling as consumers shun traditional grocery staples for healthier options.At Heinz, the first deal that Buffett did with Lemann, 3G immediately installed its own managers. They shuttered five factories, did away with employee perks and eliminated more than 7,000 jobs. After just 18 months, Heinzs profit margins (based on a measure known as Ebitda) rose to an industry-leading 26% from 18% prior to the takeover.Loaded UpThat paved the way for the Kraft Foods takeover, which was announced in March 2015. At the time, 3G promised to cut $1.5 billion in annual costs by the end of 2017. So far, its ahead of schedule. According to research from Bernstein, Kraft Heinz is already 88% of the way there. Margins are also up. Before the acquisition, Krafts Ebitda consistently hovered around 20% of revenue. Now, the combined companys margin is at 30%.Investors have taken notice. Shares of Kraft Heinz have risen 23% since the company began trading in July 2015more than double the gain of consumer staples stocks in the S&P 500 Index.Kraft Heinzs success is fueling speculation 3G will soon need to look for yet another target to tack on to keep things going. Last November, news that the investment firm was raising at least $5 billion to finance a new acquisition pushed shares of General Mills, Kellogg, Campbell and Mondelez higher.Theyve pretty much implemented the playbook, so theyre loaded up and ready to go, said Asit Sharma, an analyst at The Motley Fool.Takeover TalkMany food-industry executives are already feeling the heat. Last year, Mondelezs pursuit of Hershey was partly seen as a defensive move to bulk up and stave off a takeover. Hershey resisted and a deal never happened.RBCs Palmer says Mondelez, which generates more than 70% of its revenue outside of North America, is the most likely target for Kraft Heinz. Kraft and Mondelez split in 2012, but now the company would give 3G an international presence and plenty of room to improve margins.A possible takeover of Mondelez, which has a market value of almost $70 billion, has even attracted the likes of hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman, who took a large stake in the company in 2015.Other analysts have focused on General Mills, Kellogg and Campbell, which would give Kraft Heinz a stronger US presence in categories like snack chips, soup and cereal, and make it easier for 3G to cut costs. Bernsteins Alexia Howard says Kraft Heinz will buy General Mills later this year.(3G declined to comment, as did Kraft Heinz, General Mills, Kellogg and Campbell. Buffett didnt respond to requests for comment.)Wild CardOne potential wild card is Donald Trump. The new US president has vowed to protect American jobs and has aggressively gone after companies that have moved them overseas. Big job cutsa hallmark of every 3G takeovercould draw Trumps ire, says Ken Shea, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.They may have a tougher time politically laying off thousands of people, Shea said.That hasnt kept some investors from talking about what would be the most audacious deal of them all: a Buffett-backed takeover of Coke.Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway is Cokes biggest shareholder (with a 9% stake) and Lemann once called the company his dream acquisition.To swallow the $179 billion soft-drink maker, an offer would probably need to come from Anheuser-Busch InBev, which Lemann controls along with other Brazilian billionaires and wealthy Belgian families. AB InBev and Coke both declined to comment.As recently as 2015, Buffett said a deal was very unlikely because Coke wasnt looking for one. But last month, his son Howard announced he wouldnt stand for re-election to the companys board. CEO Muhtar Kent also said he will step down next year and hand the reins to his lieutenant, James Quincey. Thats fueled speculation a deal is more likely now.This seems like a situation tailor-made for a 3G transformation, said Steve Wallman, a fund manager and longtime Berkshire shareholder.

0.43,"Does your flagship Boroline cream have a market outside West Bengal?
				   
				Boroline has always had a strong market outside West Bengal. But previously, say around 20 years ago, 60% of our revenue came from West Bengal. But now at least 65% of our revenue comes from outside West Bengal.Which are the states where your products are doing well?In the past 4-5 years, some states such as Maharashtra and Gujarat have done phenomenally well for us. In Mumbai alone, for instance, we have some 45 distributors now, up from just 10 six years ago. The market for our products is spread across the country now, though there are still some states such as Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telengana which are not doing as well as they should.In nearby Kerala, we are doing very well. Also in Tamil Nadu, we used to have a very strong market previouslysay in the 1970s.What kind of distribution strength do you have now?We have around 28 SKUs (stock keeping units) now. We dont sell all of them nationally, but for our key productsthe Boroline cream and the Suthol liquidwe have close to 2,400 distributors across the country.What is the creams contribution to your revenue?For years, we have been a one-product company. So clearly, the Boroline ointments contribution to our Rs150 crore revenue is still quite high at about 60%. But Suthol, which was launched in 2003, is fast gaining traction, and now accounts for about 30% of our revenue. Suthol sales are growing 20% year-on-year, while Boroline sales are growing 8%.The balance 10% of our revenue comes from our other productsEleen hair oil, Penorub pain reliving lotion and Glosoft face washmost of which are sold only in West Bengal.Within these categories, the Boroline cream sold in the tube is still the biggest. But our fastest growing SKU is the creams Rs10 tub.What led to the launch of Suthol?Around 2001, the companys then chairperson, my mother, the late Bela Dutta, was bed-ridden. Soumitra Pal, one of our directors, suggested that we develop our own antiseptic liquid for her. What he came up with turned out to be very effective. So we decided to launch it commercially.But when doing so, we decided to market it differently because the space for multipurpose antiseptic liquid was already taken by strong brands such as Dettol and Savlon.We called Suthol an antiseptic skin liquid and positioned it as a solution for heat rashes. There were prickly heat powders in the market, but no liquid. So it took off immediately. Though Suthol has a wide variety of usesyou can, for instance, splash it to ward off mosquitoesits sales are seasonal and are still dependent on how bad the summer is.We are expanding the Suthol range: apart from three different fragrances, we have launched an alcohol-free variant. The response is very encouraging. So, we shall have more Suthol variants going alcohol-free.At least two other product linesEleen hair oil and Penorubhave high brand recall, at least in West Bengal. Why are these not sold nationally?It is by choice that we are not selling them nationally. Eleen was launched in the late 1990s and was our first diversification in many years. The product was designed keeping in mind the preferences of consumers in West Bengal in terms of texture and fragrance.Penorub is not new to our portfoliowe used to have an ointment by that name previously. It was in demand but we had to phase it out in 1987-88 because of problems with procuring ingredients. In 2006-07, we re-launched it as a gel and towards the end of 2014, as a roll-on. We are working on other forms of packaging so that the lotion could be applied more effectively to relieve pain. To my mind, it will start to get traction in about one-and-a-half years, when we will look to launch it nationally.What to your mind are your key strengths?Our products and our people. We use natural ingredients in all our productsnothing synthetic at all. Add to it our ability to develop new products in-house. We have a team of 14 led by my wife Mahashweta Dutta dedicated to product development. And we have made sure that our successful products are consistentthey dont change.Detractors say Boroline is a sticky ointment. We agree Boroline is ultra rich and will always be so. And because of its thick texture, it is so effective in treating dry skin. We advise people to use it at night.Consistency in quality is so important to us that in the early 1990sin 1998 or 1999we had to suspend production of Boroline because our fragrance supplier was not being able to supply ingredients of the same quality as it previously did. We suffered an outage of at least three months before we could find a new supplier who could produce the same fragrance. Most of our suppliers today are family owned enterprises. The common trait between us and our suppliers is our commitment to product consistency.Our people are just as important to us as our customers. We have around 250 employees now, and on average, they have put in 10-15 years each in our company. If you consider the people in senior management, that number is going to go up manifold. Our directors, for instance, have worked in this company for over 30 years.What is your experience of dealing with labour unrest in West Bengal?Yes, we have had issues with workers in our unit here, which was commissioned in 1988. And even previously, when we used to operate out of a rented facility in north Kolkata.But our policy has been very simple: never reach out to people outside the company to resolve labour disputes. Because we believe that our workers have the same goal as the managementfor mutual benefit, the company must prosper. Sometimes, it took time, but we have settled all our disputes internally.To be fair, labour issues started to come down at the turn of the century but overall industrial environment improved significantly only since Mamata Banerjee came to power in 2011.You have led the company for 15 years. Where do you see this company headed in the days ahead?We enjoy a great deal of goodwill in consumers mind. But market dynamics are changing, and the art of marketing goodwill is changing with every passing day. Our thrust going forward will be on expanding retail penetration. Whereas previously, we would deal with say one or two distributors in a whole district, we now need to reach out to several distributors even in villages.ALSO READ | Its business as usual for 87-year-old BorolineAlongside, we would also want the export market to open up and launch new products.

				The companys net sales declined 13.4% to Rs1,064.69 crore from Rs1,229.59 crore a year ago.The fall in Wockhardts earnings in the September quarter is mainly due to the high base of last year when it had certain one-time gains, the company said in a statement.Excluding the one-offs, net profit and sales were up 6% and 1% on year, respectively, the company said.

0.6,"The Essar Group may have been in a debt trap, but there are no signs of distress in the Essar Oil Ltd sale to PJSC Rosneft Oil Co and a consortium led by commodities trader Trafigura and private investment group United Capital Partners. Essar said it has sold a 98% stake in the oil company at an enterprise valuation (EV) of $10.9 billion or Rs72,800 crore.
				   
				This works out to around 12.5 times Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization). Most analysts value Reliance Industries Ltds refining business at an EV/Ebitda multiple of around seven times at best. Prima facie, Essar has got itself a good deal.Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients, The formal announcement of the deal at the recent BRICS summit in the presence of the political leaders of India and Russia suggests a high degree of involvement of the Indian government in the transaction. We note that Indian PSU oil companies had earlier purchased a 49.9% stake in the Vankor oil block of Rosneft.Besides, according to a Bloomberg report, Essar was in talks with as many as five overseas oil companies for the asset sale. Its natural that Rosneft and the consortium ended up paying a premium when the competition was as high.That aside, the Essar asset offers decent growth opportunities. The company has had plans to double capacity at the existing plant, but couldnt do so because of financial constraints. The buyers should be able to follow through on these expansion plans and drive growth. Besides, Essar Oils refinery is in close proximity to the deep draft Vadinar port, which lends greater efficiency to the operations. The port has been acquired in a separate transaction at a valuation of $2 billion. Essar Oil also operates a network of 2,700 retail outlets. They may not have added much to overall profits until now, but their prospects have improved because of increased deregulation of prices of petroleum products.Rosneft can drive synergies by shipping relatively cheap crude oil from Venezuela and the Trafigura connect will help in selling oil products to Asia-Pacific markets.Essar Oil currently processes around 145 million barrels of crude oil annually. According to an oil industry analyst who did not want to be identified, its safe to assume that the company makes an Ebitda of around $6 per barrel, resulting in an annual Ebitda of $870 million. While this results in an expensive valuation of 12.5 times for the refining asset, this must be seen in light of other growth prospects, the added advantage of the port facility and the retail outlets, he adds. What about implications of the deal for Indian companies?The Essar Groups total debt in the system is estimated to be about Rs1.3 trillion, and this is expected to reduce substantially after the deal. While the group will use the proceeds to pay off debt, bank debt will also reduce, as part of Essar Oils debt is being refinanced by a Russian lender, according to news reports.ALSO SEE | Rosneft-Essar Oil deal cuts Essar Groups debt, lifts banksICICI Bank Ltd, one of the largest lenders to the Essar Group, has already seen a nearly $1.5 billion rise in market capitalization after the deal announcement.

				Over the weekend, six state-owned banks reported a combined increase in bad loans of Rs.24,622 crore in the March quarter. This is on the back of Rs.29,538 crore reported in the December quarter; thats when the results of the RBI review became evident. The chart shows the spike for these six lenders, whose combined bad loans top Rs.1.3 trillion, in the last couple of quarters.Their stocks took a hammering and investors were left with a spate of questions.One, with the economy showing signs of improvement and even corporate earnings coming off their bottom, what explains this sudden surge in bad loans? It is not as if asset quality recognition norms have suddenly changed overnight. Clearly, bank managements till now were kicking the can down the road.In fairness, some sectors such as iron and steel and infrastructure have not had it easy for the past many years. They have been the ones repeatedly highlighted by banks as responsible for the rise in bad loans. But only when RBI releases its next financial stability report will the true extent of the rotand how widespread it is, if at allbe known.Two, has the bleeding been stanched? Is this the bottom? The answer is a resounding no.After a fashion, some of the bigger banks have started declaring asset quality watch lists. Bank of Baroda has said that it has suspect quality loans worth Rs.26,900 crore, of which 57% could potentially turn bad this financial year. While the others havent been as forthcoming, the big pile of restructured loans, those refinanced under the 5/25 scheme and loans under the strategic debt restructuring (SDR) process throw up enough red flags.Union Bank of India, for instance, has an SDR portfolio of Rs.1,840 crore, Rs.2,500 crore under 5/25 and Rs.8,500 of standard restructured assets.The net result of this car wreck is losses and the erosion in net worth. Five of these six PSU bankswith the exception of Union Bank of Indiareported losses. Together, they topped Rs.7,000 crore. (To be sure, extra provisions mandated by RBI towards Punjab food credit were also responsible for an increase in provisions).Even if the bad loan pile-up ends here, banks problems dont. Many state-owned banks have a precarious capital position. UCO Bank, for instance, has a capital adequacy ratio of 9.63% at the end of March and Central Bank of India 10.4%.

0.06,"Mumbai: The National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) has battled several issues this yearthere was a stand off with shareholders on its listing plans; allegations surfaced of allowing unfair access to some brokers; and managing director Chitra Ramkrishna resigned unexpectedly. 
				   
				In an interview, chairman Ashok Chawla said the initial share sale of the nations largest exchange will likely happen in the beginning of the April-June quarter after it hires a new managing director and completes corrective action based on a forensic audit to examine allegations of unfair access to its algorithm trading platform. Edited excerpts: NSE has been in the eye of a storm in the recent past. NSE is an efficient and well-oiled organization and it is not for nothing that the exchange over the years has grown from zero percent market share to 85%. In an organization, issues do come up sometime that are not necessarily defining aspects. There have been some technological issues in the past, which were resolved in 2014 and are also under investigation to prevent any future occurrences. Listing of the exchange is being pursued with a fair degree of rigour, as it is only appropriate that the existing shareholders get an exit option. Resignation of the managing director and CEO had nothing to do with thispeople come and go for many reasons. In her case it was personal reasons.The NSE management has mostly been averse to listing in the past. NSE wasnt opposed to listing, but they had two concerns the need for restructuring of the company into regulated and unregulated businesses, and a perception that if they list on a competing exchange it could lead to some troubles. Last few months the board has looked at these issues; restructuring is worth looking at at some point but that should not be something that the listing process should be held hostage to. Listing on the other exchange is the regulators decision so we will abide by that. What would be the size of the offer?The offer for sale (OFS) is not to raise money as we have adequate cash on our books. All the 70 shareholders of NSE have been asked to offer some of their shares in the OFS, which is coming to be around 20-25%. ALSO READ: NSE must list sans hubris or risk investor scornThe current Sebi rules do not allow for an overseas listing, so is the overseas listing off the table?There was some thinking initially to tap global markets through overseas listing but for now we are restricting ourselves to domestic listing. We could revisit it later. We had earlier said that by January we would file a Draft Red Herring Prospectus with Sebi but now we have preponed the timeline and would file by 20 December for a domestic listing.Issues have been raised that the NSE board examining the issues of alleged unfair access to certain brokers while accessing the algorithmic trading platform is a case of NSE investigating itself.As per the Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India) directive, we have commissioned a forensic audit to examine the allegations and the report is expected from Deloitte India in few days. We would submit the entire report to the regulator and if the board has some observations and comments to offer then we would add those. Whether there would be a fair examination of the allegations considering that NSE has commissioned the audit, you should ask the regulator. There would be some confidence that Sebi has in the NSE board.Considering the timelines you have highlighted would it be safe to say that the exchange would not list till the new CEO is in place and the issues around allegations of unfair access are resolved?Yes, we would not list till these two issues are resolved as this is the prudent thing to do. The new MD and CEO would be in place before the end of the first quarter of the coming calendar. Corrective actions based on the forensic audit in consultation with Sebi would also be finished around the same time. As to listing this would happen around the beginning of the second quarter of the calendar year. Is NSE okay with listing on a rival exchangebecause of the concerns of conflict of interest that may arise out of cross listing remain?We have requested Sebi to provide some comfort in existing regulations. For instance, in case the exchange, acting as regulator, proposes an action against an exchange which is listed on its platform perhaps it could be looked at by some external party or independent member. Sebi is positively considering the proposal, if it comes then it would give the parties some ease and if it doesnt then the philosophy behind cross listing isyou cant be a judge of your own cause and we will honour that. ALSO READ: NSE CEO exit: Examining Sebi, NSE boards roles There have been many reports pointing to differences with the board being the reason for Chitra Ramkrishnas exit from NSE.Differences with the board are something like what two people have while talking across a table, nothing more than that. At least there were no issues between the board and the ex-CEO that could have prompted such a move on her part, so to that extent I deny (these claims). Reportedly, the board was concerned about the appointment of the group chief operating officer Anand Subramanian. So, are you saying that the board had no concerns on his appointment?Well, there is no merit in visiting that issue today. This was something that happened in the past and we would like to leave it there.

0.25,"Private equity (PE) firm Kedaara Capital Advisors Ltd, co-founded by PE veteran Manish Kejriwal, is gearing up to float its second fund to raise around $600-650 million, two people familiar with the matter said. The formal process is expected to begin by mid-2017, one of the persons said on condition of anonymity.
				   
				Kedaara was founded in 2011 by Kejriwal, former India head of Singapore sovereign wealth management fund Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd, Sunish Sharma and Nishant Sharma, who were managing director and principal, respectively, of global PE firm General Atlantic in India.The PE firm raised its debut fund with a corpus of $540 million in 2013, in one of the largest fund-raisings by an independent, home-grown PE platforms until then.Originally targeting $500 million, the fund was oversubscribed, attracting investors from all over. Canadian pension fund Ontario Teachers Pension Plan anchored the vehicle and was joined by other sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, family offices, fund of funds and endowments.On its second outing, the PE firm is currently sending feelers to prospective limited partners (LPs), or investors in investment funds.They are initiating soft conversations with prospective LPs now and will embark on a formal fund-raising process only by mid-next year, said the first person cited above on condition on anonymity.The move to launch a second fund comes on the heels of two stellar exits recorded by the firm.They have registered stellar exits in a short frame of time. They have made about 75% IRR (internal rate of return) in Au Financiers and about 55% IRR in Bill Forge, added the second person.In September, automotive components supplier Mahindra CIE Automotive, a joint venture between Mahindra Group and CIE of Spain, agreed to acquire a 100% stake in Bengaluru-based machine components manufacturer Bill Forge, for about $200 million.Kedaara, which acquired 50% stake in Bill Forge last year for around $48 million, exited completely. In June, it exited Au Financiers Ltd, a retail non-banking financial services company and one of the 10 firms to receive in-principle approval to start a small finance bank.A report in VCCircle said that foreign investors sold their holdings in Au Financiers in part or full in a deal worth $110 million to help the latter bring down the foreign holding to 49% from 64% to comply with one of the prerequisites for a small bank licence.When contacted, Kedaaras co-founder and managing director Kejriwal said, We do not comment on market rumours.Both Kedaaras recent exits have been quick compared to the usual PE  investment horizon of three to five years.The speedy exits by Kedaara could well be a good thing for the PE firm. A recent study by McKinsey & Co.s Private Equity and Principal Investment Group showed that PE returns drop as holding periods increase. According to the study, PE investments with holding periods of between one and three years delivered above 40% return, higher than any other holding period.The performance on exits shown by Kedaara also comes at a time when the Indian PE industry, notorious for its poor exit performance, has witnessed over $16 billion worth of exits in the past two years.According to data from Venture Intelligence, so far in 2016, PE funds have registered exits worth $6.7 billion, while in 2015, PE funds recorded exits worth $9.4 billion. The 2015 exit performance was the highest in the past five years.Kedaaras debut deal was an investment of Rs200 crore in Mahindra Logistics Ltd in April 2014. It has also invested in companies such as Parksons Packaging Ltd and Manjushree Technopack. Its latest investment was the buyout of Au Housing Finance, the mortgage arm of Au Financiers, along with Swiss PE firm Partners Group, for around $140 million.The private equity firm is about 55% committed across six investments which is about $300 million and has invested across sectors, said the second person cited above.Kedaara positions itself as an operationally oriented PE firm pursuing control and minority investment opportunities in India.

0.15,"New York: Is Twitters best path to find a new owner? Probably. Will Twitter get sold? Maybe. Is it sensible for any company to buy Twitter for $15 billion or much more? Nope.
				   
				CNBCs David Faber reported on Friday that Twitter is moving closer to a sale and may have a formal takeover offer soon. A sale isnt imminent, CNBC said, but this is perhaps the most credible reporting to date that Twitters directors may be willing to close the curtain on the companys troubled run on the public markets. In the absence of a clear business strategy, the only thing that drives up Twitters stock price these days is hopes the company might be acquired. And predictably, Twitters stock soared about 22% in early trading Friday, giving the company a market value of more than $16 billion. Before Friday, Twitter was trading at a relatively modest four times its expected revenue for the coming year, but those numbers are not reliable given the companys track record of missing its own forecasts.The constant rumors about Twitter getting sold drive up the share price and make an acquisition potentially even more expensive. Given Twitters struggles to add users, its deteriorating finances and advertisers growing disenchantment with the company as a way to market to consumers, a sale of Twitter at current prices is imminently irrational. Of course when it comes to acquisitions, rich companies do unpredictable things. Sometimes that works out for the best  Facebook buying WhatsApp, for example  and sometimes it doesnt  such as Microsoft buying ... anything.CBNC said Google and Salesforce.com are engaged in conversations about a deal for Twitter. Google is a natural owner for Twitter and has been a rumored buyer for years. Google or Facebook  relatively immune from caring about what their shareholders think  could easily absorb Twitter, hide the companys financial results and tack it onto their existing advertising sales machines. Still, its not clear why even Google would be willing to buy Twitter now, rather than wait for it to get cheaper.Salesforce, on the other hand, is a bit of a head-scratcher as a potential Twitter buyer. It is true that one of Salesforces biggest lines of business is selling software used by customer-service departments to handle complaints and feedback. Twitter is likewise avidly used by customer-service teams  as you may have noticed if you ever tweeted gripes about your cable company and got a response from them on Twitter.But its not clear why Salesforce would spend roughly 30% of its market cap to ensure Twitter and Salesforce customer-service features are used in tandem; the same benefits can be achieved with smart software collaboration. Its also possible that Salesforce chief executive officer Marc Benioff  who tried really, really, really hard to buy LinkedIn  simply wants the attention that comes from making a play for a high-profile target like Twitter. Salesforce shareholders dont look happy about such a vanity deal. The companys stock price was down about 4% in early trading Friday. Once again were in the same place with Twitter weve been for years: An acquisition makes little sense at Twitters current prices, especially as shares go up on every takeover rumor. But just because it doesnt make sense doesnt mean it wont happen.

0.25,"When was the last time you listened to music on an actual CD? Or read the days headlines in a physical newspaper? Chances are it has been years. Digital technology and software has replaced a lot of things in our lives.
				   
				According to media futurist Robert Tercek, going forward, we will see more of vaporization, a term he has coined to refer to the process of replacing physical things with software that can be downloaded to any device. The apps on your phone have quietly replaced newspapers, books, music players, diaries and countless other things.We are moving from millions to billions, to trillions of connected devices, and the invisible world of software is growing at twice the rate of the normal economy, says Tercek.As more people connect to the network, the software of the network becomes more valuable and that drives even more people to connect, increasing the value of the network. In an interview, Tercek, the former president of digital media at The Oprah Winfrey Network and author of the book Vaporized, talks about how software is disrupting society. Edited excerpts:You say we are moving to a software-defined society. How is that changing the way the economy functions?The first rule thats important for the software world is this idea that the network is more valuable and the devices get cheaperthat changes the economics. Its very difficult for manufacturing companies to understand that in the future products will be cheaper, but also more valuable. Devices will get cheaper and smarter. Metcalfes Law says the network will get more valuable over time. For the end-users, things cost less, so they expect devices to be cheaper and smarter and they expect to get more value out of them. For companies that manufacture products, this is very difficult. Those companies are vulnerable to Internet economics, the economics of Facebook or Google. Thats a challenge that most havent realized.All companies will become software companies. The implication of that has not yet sunk in and many companies are still operating in old industrial styles. They seldom realize that software is far more important than the physical product. Auto manufacturers, for instance, dont see themselves as software companies; they see themselves as car makers. They think the value is in the metal, rubber and plastic. The value is very quickly moving to software. The companies that focus on software for auto are going to be most successful. We saw the same thing in personal computers, mobile phones and consumer electronics: software eventually became more important than the physical device.Which industries are most prone to vaporization? Are any immune?No industry is immune. I also think that governments, education and healthcare will soon be affected, so this is a mega trend that will reshape the whole society. The industries that have been most affected so far are finance, media, consumer electronics and advertising. The next that will be transformed are healthcare, transportation, education and insurance. Everything that happened in infotech during the past 40 years will soon happen to every other industry in the world. So, in a way, you can see that any business that involves geographytransportation, logistics or shoppingwill be transformed into information businesses. Biology is becoming an information science as well, so agriculture, pharmaceuticals, healthcare and the food industry are going to change. We are now able to program biology in the same way we program a computer.Manufacturing is going to be transformed in a couple of ways. The first one is, of course, robotics. Robotics is the replacement of human labour with software, thats what software automation is. The other trends that are important as well are 3D printing and nanotechnology. Theres already now a 3D printer from Revolution Medicine that will take any substance and break it down to its molecular parts, sort them out and then using software, recompose those molecules into new forms, including combinations that dont exist in nature When things are replaced by software, it means that the barriers that constraintime and spaceare eliminated, because software can deliver instantly. China and Asia, the places that we have been outsourcing manufacturing for the US and Europe, (will) no longer have their big advantage. It will erode because now you will be able to manufacture in any place using software.How are governments changing the way they function?In the past, most governments used human labour to enforce regulation and process paper and handle information. In both cases, software can do a better job. When you have sensors measuring everything, you dont need human regulators checking everything. You can simply do that with software and have better data than we get from human inspectors, so enforcement regulation will change tremendously. In future, we will be able to write the rule in software and encode in a bitcoin(-style) blockchain. All the sensors that are connected to the system will simply report the data and we will have software-defined regulation.In a representative democracy, voting is also [going to be] encoded in the blockchain very soon. We have already seen some parties in Scandinavia use the blockchain for their own internal voting.Whats the future of big corporations like the GEs of the world?The reason we have big corporations is because its more efficient for a company to avoid transaction costs for managing a group of freelance suppliers. As long as its cheaper to do a job internally within a corporation, the job will be done internally. But now the Internet makes it very easy for companies to hire workers who arent on the payroll, workers who are outside the corporation. You can use software to manage them. One way to look at Uber is that it has vaporized managementthe management of the dispatcher is a software program, so job functions have been turned into software. It suggests that we may not need corporations in the future. A company called Ethereum in Canada is trying to replace the entire corporation with software. They are trying to write a software robot program that has all the job functions in the corporation which is kind of a crazy idea, (but it is) actually quite possible.Do big corporations need to drastically change their business models?In industry after industry, corporations move too slowly. They dont go out of business, they just become less relevant because they are not where the growth is. So, if you choose not to participate, you choose not to turn your company into software or replace jobs with software, you wont disappear overnight. A future growth (driver) will emerge and your company will not be part of it. Auto makers and watch makers have a difficult choice to make: they cant stop making cars or watches, thats their business today. At the same time, they see that the future is going to be all about software, and cars or watches will be less important, but they are not good at making software. They certainly arent good enough to compete with Google or other software giants. Should that company embark on a rapid course of action and try to become a software developer or should they partner with Google? If you partner with Google, thats not a great strategy because look at what happened to the smartphone companies. All the companies that manufacture smartphones dont make much money on smartphones: Google literally commoditizes these companies because it sucks the value out of the device and into the network.This is a very difficult challenge for every company that manufactures products: they must become a software company. The question is do they build it themselves, do they buy a company or do they partner with a giant company like Google and become part of their ecosystem? All difficult choices.What do you see emerging as the new sources of competitive advantage in this new world?The companies that understand they have a proprietary data asset will (succeed). What I mean by proprietary data asset is any information asset that grows. In the case of Facebook, thats the social graph. There are many other companies that are mapping the world right now, they are building a location graph. Google has tremendous knowledge about where people are surfing and where they are going, so they have the interest graph. Each company can thereby define a graph.The idea is that each business has at its core, a unit of information, a body of information. When we move business to the network, that information asset should grow if you design your business in the right way. That will emerge as the most important thing for that company over time: an information asset that continues to grow as more people and more devices are connected.Companies that dont rush to embrace often lose their information advantage and someone else comes and steals that from them. So, one way to look at all the struggles that are happening around the world right now, is theres a battle happening for control of data assets. You see this when Google is confronted by the European government about privacy, or when Apple is confronted by the FBI about secrecy and security. Most companies do not understand how to manage or protect their data assets. The successful companies make (data protection) a priority.So, what do you think the Fortune 500 list will look like 20 years from now? What kind of companies will you see there and which ones would be gone?Big automotive makers will be replaced by big companies that provide transportation as a service. Banks will be replaced by companies that provide automatic, secure transactions using the blockchain or something similar Today, the businesses of pharmaceutical companies is a bit like Hollywood: they spend lots of money making drugs and they hope that one becomes a big hit and they make billions of dollars. In the future, you will have customized medical treatment designed for your genome. It will be individualized healthcare. So, pharmaceutical (companies will) shift from mass manufacturing drugs to more of a service delivery model that will be customized to individuals. The companies themselves may stay and remain successful, but they will change into software companies that provide digital services.What other areas will feel the impact?Education will be delivered in software in the future and this bothers a lot of people who feel very sentimental about college education. Its obvious that most people in the world cant afford to go to a private college, most university systems [cannot] take in millions of new students. There has to be an alternative. Software delivery education is the reality today. Its not as good as college education, but remember, these are early days. We have to educate a billion people a year, theres no way we can do that within campus. Robotics will shift so many people out of jobs, everyone will have to retrained. Every worker will have to reskill and retrain consistently. One of the things we will have to do is learn how to work with machines, robots and software automation.If you think about all the really big industries in the worldhealthcare, food supply, transportation, energyall these enormous systems have been designed to serve human beings. That worked well for the last 200 years, but heres the question: if you can vaporize everything, the ultimate expression is to replace the human body by software. Can we replace the human body with software? It seems preposterous, yet there are scientists working right now to model the human brain and replicate the human being in software. Some scientists are working on whole brain emulation. Why? One, there are a lot of places we cant explore: in the depths of the ocean, inside volcanoes, deep inside the earth and also in space. Human beings cant survive in those environments, machines can. If we travel to other stars or planets, the only way thats going to happen is if we can replace the human body, because too much of the weight of spacecraft cargo is life support for human bodies.Is everything about this good?Theres always danger with technology. Technology always makes something that we are familiar with obsolete. You can think of it as super power: it introduces new powers that can be used for good or bad. We shouldnt judge the technology, its really how it is used we should judge, that is a human decision. People are worried about artificial intelligence. This is silly. Its artificial intelligence thats poorly written, (that is used in) the wrong way by human beings, those are things we should be concerned with.Read an unabridged version of the interview on www.foundingfuel.com, published in an exclusive partnership with knowledge.ckgsb.edu.cn/",2016-11-07,CkPEF5bEOBXf98u5jbt98L,"Robert Tercek, futurist and author of the book Vaporized, talks about how digital technology pushes us towards a software-defined society",02:41,No industry is immune from vaporization: Robert Tercek

				One, construction income was the sweet spot that drove net revenue higher by about 72% from a year earlier, catapulting it higher than the streets forecast. Two, the pace of project completion was faster, and, three, tolling revenue came in higher than expected.So, a huge revenue beat pushed up the quarters operating profit by about 80% from a year earlier. Further, ITNLs decent order book provides growth assurance over the next 12-18 months.But then, the high proportion of income from the construction segment turns out to be a double-edged sword. While it fuels revenue growth, it does not augur well for profit margins. Operating margin at 30.5%, although wider than the year-ago period, fell short of that pencilled in by brokerages. ITNLs margin was also impacted adversely by a Rs.44 crore provisioning made during the quarter towards loans that the firm is doubtful of receiving.The concerns on profitability are likely to continue as most of the orders are in the low-margin construction segment. This is not all. ITNLs balance sheet is already highly stressed with a debt-to-equity ratio in excess of 4. This weighs down investor sentiment, which makes the ITNL stock wobbly. Besides, in spite of turning in a better than expected revenue and order book growth, the stock has underperformed the benchmark indices in the last one year.The silver lining in the cloud of debt is that the recently raised money, through a rights issue, should lower leverage. But according to the post-results review by Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd, Leverage continues to surge higher and ITNL earnings highly leveraged to new orders, equity funding gap would still put pressure on balance sheet.What would work in favour of the company is strong revenue traction as new projects are due to get commissioned, easing cash flows from business operations over the next 12 months.

-0.59,"Mumbai: The US-based stressed asset specialist Lone Star Funds has applied to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to set up an asset reconstruction company (ARC) with an eye on the massive bad loan-related opportunity in India, three people aware of the development said.
				   
				They have been scouting the Indian market for the last couple of months for stressed assets opportunities in the power and infrastructure sectors. As part of their strategy to tap this opportunity they have applied to RBI for setting up an ARC, said one of the three persons cited above, requesting anonymity as he is not authorized to speak to reporters.The ARC will be part of an India platform that Lone Star is looking to build, said the second person mentioned above. They are in the process of setting up a team to manage stressed infra assets in India. They are also looking to raise a new fund currently, a significant part of which will likely be dedicated to India, he added.Lone Star Funds declined to comment on the development. Lone Star is a global private equity firm that invests in real estate, equity, credit and other financial assets. Since the establishment of its first fund in 1995, Lone Star has raised 16 PE funds with aggregate capital commitments totalling over $65 billion, according to the funds website.Lone Star seeks opportunities in markets where liquidity is restricted and financing is constrained, where balance sheets of financial institutions are in stress and there is a need to dispose of high volumes of assets to manage capital, deleverage and build liquidity.Mint reported 19 October that Lone Star is in discussions with infrastructure conglomerate GMR Group to acquire a significant stake in GMR Chhattisgarh Energy Ltd, a unit of GMR Energy Ltd.With its plans to start an ARC, Lone Star joins the ranks of funds and financial services institutions that are looking to tap the huge bad loans mess that faces the Indian banking system. The gross bad loans of 39 listed Indian banks, in absolute terms, rose 92% in fiscal 2016 to Rs5.79 trillion.The Lone Star move comes after the government, seeking to resolve problem of mounting bad loans in Indias banking sector, decided in May to allow foreign institutions to fully own ARCs.Although local banks have trillions of rupees worth of bad loans on their books, the capital lying with existing ARCs in India is enough to buy only a fraction of the stressed assets available.Indias attempt to rid its banking sector of stressed assets is providing an opportunity for those with experience and the funds to turn around assets. Amongst those who have applied for setting up ARCs are global stressed asset specialist JC Flowers and Co., in partnership with Ambit Holdings Pvt. Ltd,  domestic financial services firm IIFL Holdings Ltd and Sudhir Valia, the former chief financial officer of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.Other global private equity funds, such as KKR and Co., Hong Kong-based SSG Capital Management and International Finance Corp.

1.0,"London/New York: Wall Streets high-flyers in Davos, basking in their firms strong fourth-quarter earnings, said theyre confident Donald Trumps incoming administration will loosen regulatory constraints on financierseven if it leaves Barack Obamas signature Dodd-Frank Act largely intact.
				   
				Bank executives, speaking on condition of anonymity at events around the Swiss ski resort, said theyre not counting on Trump to overturn Dodd-Frank. Instead, they expect the federal agencies that enforce the rules to ease up on them and support bankers efforts to limit how much capital and liquidity their companies need to pay bills or absorb losses in a crisis.The bankers said they recognize that changing or overturning the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act would require support in the US Senate that Republicans may lack. Instead theyre counting on Trumps team to dial back how supervisory agencies enforce and interpret rules. Led by Federal Reserve governor Daniel Tarullo, US regulators have adopted an extra-strict version of the global standards on capital and liquidity set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.ALSO READ | A warning to Donald Trump from Friedrich HayekLegislation, obviously thats harder to do than just changing regulations, JPMorgan Chase & Co. chief executive officer Jamie Dimon said in a Bloomberg Television interview with John Micklethwait on Wednesday. Regulators can change a lot of things easily about compliance, about costs, certain rules about lending, how you use your liquidity, how you use your capital. I would like to see some of those looked at and maybe modified a bit, and I think it would be good for the economy.At a panel discussion on the global banking outlook in Davos Thursday morning, JPMorgan asset-management CEO Mary Callahan Erdoes echoed that view.Its going to be a great several years, Erdoes said. Its going to be very positive for businesses in the US, which should cascade to businesses around the world.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO Lloyd Blankfein offered a similarly optimistic view in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Davos on Thursday.If you look at the policies that Trump has committed himself to, they are quite stimulative and quite market-supportive, Blankfein said. If you look at spending on infrastructure, lower tax rate and overlapping regulation, they are quite stimulative, far more stimulative than what people were expecting had the Democrats won the election.The Goldman Sachs CEO also said theres an opportunity to re-legislate financial regulations as the US did with the Securities Exchange Act after the Great Depression.I think were going to open it up, Blankfein said. You can call it Dodd-Frank, as amended.ALSO READ | These automakers could be Donald Trumps next targetsWall Street bank shares, including JPMorgans and Goldman Sachss, have rallied since the election on speculation that Trumps policies will accelerate economic growth and drive higher interest rates.While Trumps transition team said after the election that it would work to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act and replace it with new policies to encourage economic growth and job creation, few bankers see Dodd-Frank as a priority. Even billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who Trump appointed as a special adviser last month to overhaul regulations, said in a CNN interview that he wouldnt support killing Dodd-Frank.Several bankers in Davos said theyre optimistic that regulators under Trump could do away with the gold-plating by the US of the latest Basel benchmarks and ease the process by which banks are stress-tested annually to ensure they have adequate capital to absorb losses in a hypothetical crisis.In Europe, where bankers argue the regions economic woes are exacerbated by the constraints on lenders, regulators have already helped delay agreement on a new set of global requirements.The Federal Reserve has led US rule-making efforts, including Basel implementation. Trump can appoint a vice-chairman for regulation, effectively replacing Tarullo, who has filled the role unofficially and antagonized bankers with his strict approach to regulation. That, along with other appointments, could help tip the Fed toward a more bank-friendly approach.ALSO READ | Wary of Donald Trump, China hails Obama for progress in Sino-US tiesIt also could be wishful thinking. While criticizing Dodd-Frank, Republican leaders in Congress have backed even higher capital requirements than the Fed for the largest banks. Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has proposed exempting banks from most other rules in exchange for 10% capital, almost twice as much as what big banks have now.New regulators could also change the way Dodd-Frank is implemented. One part bankers hate the most, the Volcker Rule, bans the largest firms from making speculative bets with their own money. Trumps Treasury secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, the Goldman Sachs co-president named to serve as Trumps chief economic policy adviser, are expected to be more sympathetic to banks arguments that limiting their trading hurts investors by making fixed-income securities less liquid.While trading revenue has declined in recent years, the Volcker Rule and other restrictions didnt prevent a jump last year, including at Goldman Sachs, where one trader made $250 million for his firm last year.JPMorgans Dimon and other executives also have pushed against international liquidity standards that were part of the post-crisis Basel regime and designed to ensure that firms have enough easy-to-sell assets to meet claims coming due in a month and over a year.Theres $2.5 trillion sitting at the central bank called excess reserves, Dimon said in Davos. And were not free to lend it because of all these new requirements.Asked whether laws will change or just how theyre enforced, Bank of America Corp.

-0.24,"Public sector banks have been blamed for the unprecedented pile-up of bad loans since the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) ordered a clean-up of books last year. Indeed, the quarterly results that followed the clean-up showed government banks held the most toxic assets. Their private-sector counterparts were hailed for their high asset quality.
				   
				But the September quarter results show private-sector lenders, at least some of them, are as deep in troubled waters as their public sector peers. At the aggregate level, private-sector banks saw bad loan stock double on a gross basis to Rs66,314 crore and provisions treble to Rs1.2 trillion from a year ago. For the public sector group, the surge in bad loan stock was similar, but provisions rose only 49%. This could mean private-sector lenders were slow in recognizing distressed assets and making provisions. The casualties were Axis Bank Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd, Yes Bank Ltd and South Indian Bank.Axis Bank saw a significant portion of loans on its watchlist turn bad, provisions climbed fivefold and the provision coverage ratio dropped to 60% from 72% in the March quarter. At ICICI Bank, gross bad loans doubled and it had to provide Rs7,082.69 crore for them. Yes Bank and South Indian Bank also posted weak asset quality metrics.But the real worry is these private-sector lenders net non-performing assets (NPA). The accretion in net NPAs for these lenders was far higher than that of gross NPAs. This means upgrades and recoveries are slowing even as fresh slippages are showing no signs of abatement. On an aggregate basis, private-sector banks net NPA stock jumped 132% while that of the public sector banks surged a shade lower by 103%.Private banks have always been perceived to be more efficient and having a firm hand on errant borrowers. But the net NPA accretion shows they are no better than their public sector counterparts.Granted, public sector lenders are still the worst lot but it is time that private-sector banks, especially corporate lenders, are valued more realistically.

				The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is racing to complete a revamp of international capital standards by year-end. The US has pushed for strict rules to protect against future market meltdowns, whereas Europe and Japan want to rein in proposals that could hit banks with billions in costs. Basel Committee members including the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are under enormous industry pressure to soften the rules.Trumps ascendancy and his vow to dismantle financial regulations could throw another wrench in the works. If he stalls US implementation of the revised Basel Committee standards on how banks measure asset risk, or ignores them altogether, Europe could follow suit. And if the US and Europe go their own ways, the last piece of the global response to the financial crisis could be undermined.I think that before Trump, Basel was going to be softened down significantly, Sam Theodore, managing director for financial institutions at Scope Ratings AG, said in an interview. And now with Trump, I think the whole thing is going to become more of a symbolic exercise.The memory of the crisis is fading, and you have all the ingredients for the anti-regulation backlash to continue, he said.Lobbying campaignTrumps election comes at a critical juncture in the debate at the Basel Committee, which has heated up this year amid a huge industry lobbying campaign to ease the new standards on how banks assess credit, operational and market risk to determine their capital requirements, a package the bankers call Basel IV. The Basel Committee is working intensively to wrap up the reforms on time, Chairman Stefan Ingves said last week. If the global regulator meets its year-end deadline, Trump wont have time to affect the US negotiating position by shaking up the countrys four organizations on the Basel Committee, which also include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.The key thing that worries European banks at the moment is the progress of Basel IV, Howard Davies, chairman at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, said last week. An agreement is supposed to be reached by the end of the year. I doubt if the new Trump administration will be able to influence that.Tough rulesEuropean Union opposition to key elements of the Basel Committees proposals has already turned the talks into a hard slog. EU politicians and policy makers insist not only that the new rules dont significantly increase overall capital requirements, but also that the blocs banks arent unduly punished. The US, by contrast, has consistently advocated tough rules. As recently as last week, FDIC Vice Chairman Thomas Hoenig, a political independent, warned against backsliding.The process to put Basel Committee standards into national rules can easily take years to accomplish, however, and this is where Trump and Republicans in the US. Congress will have the most sway. Trump will eventually get a chance to install new faces in the Fed, FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the other US Basel member.Trump will influence the process not only through what Treasury says, but also who comes to be head of the OCC and FDIC and vice chair of supervision at the Fed, said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics in Washington.If the Basel Committee fails to deliver the package of new rules on time, US influence on the negotiations could wane, Barclays Plc analysts wrote in a note to clients last week.Trumps election campaign presented a vision for the US that was both less weighed-down by regulation, but also less engaged in shaping global consensus, they wrote.

0.93,"JSW Energy Ltd has cut a good deal with Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL). It has agreed to acquire a 1,000 megawatt (MW) thermal power plant from the latter for Rs.4,000 crore, valuing it at Rs.4 crore per MW. To set up a project of similar size will cost Rs.6.5 crore per MW. The purchase price will rise to Rs.6,500 crore if the seller manages to secure fuel supplies and find a long-term buyer for the electricity it produces by June 2018. Currently, the plant does not have either.
				   
				With the nations largest coal producer Coal India Ltd struggling to find enough customers, securing fuel supplies should not be a problem. Also, the plant is located in the coal belt (Chhattisgarh), so domestic coal can be ferried easily.What will be a challenge, however, is finding a long-term customer. According to Girishkumar Kadam, vice-president at Icra Ltd, power distribution companies are not going in for long-term power purchase agreements, or PPAs. We have not seen PPAs come in a big way. The process has been slow, Girishkumar says.If the plant is unable to find long-term buyers, it will have to depend on merchant power markets, the outlook for which is not encouraging right now. Utilization levels at the plant in question have fallen from 96% in 2014-15 to 58% in the first nine months of 2015-16. Prices on the Indian Energy Exchange remained below Rs.3 per unit last month. JSW Energy itself has guided for softening merchant power realizations in the current fiscal year.Hence the importance of a PPA. Long-term contracts ensure the asset generates the stipulated return in a certain time frame which will optimize returns for equity investors (JSW Energy in this case). So even if the purchase price is bumped up by 62%, or Rs.2,500 crore, the plant still makes economic sense, JSW Energy says.In the event the conditions are not met, the purchase price will be significantly lower, which according to an analyst will compensate for low realizations. In any case the deal has been given a good two years to fructify and valuations can change.The immediate advance JSW Energy has to pay is only Rs.500 crore. Even if JSW Energy fully finances the purchase (assuming the price of Rs.4,000 crore) through debt, the net debt-equity ratio is estimated to rise from 1.8 times to a manageable 2.2 times.So the immediate financial impact is negligible for JSW Energy.

-0.0,"This month marks the 25th anniversary of Indias big bang economic reforms. This newspaper and many others have recounted the turbulent times preceding July 1991. The backdrop was a succession of unstable governments with a rapidly deteriorating macroeconomy and the commencement of the first Gulf war leading to a spurt in oil prices. There was great drama too, with secret airlifting of Indias sovereign gold to pledge as collateral for an emergency foreign loan.
				   
				Even though 1991 is the marker, it is fair to say that reformist thinking was evident even in the mid-1980s. For instance, there were trade reforms (easing of capital goods imports), financial sector reforms (abolition of control of capital issues) and several other smaller reform measures in the administration and running of the public sector. This prior incremental journey has been forgotten because it was overtaken by the tumultuous events of 1990 and 1991.It is also clear by now that support for the reforms process was sprinkled across different ministries. Some well-known bureaucrats (now acclaimed as the architects of Indias reforms) occupied key positions in the economic ministries and the Prime Ministers Office and saw eye-to-eye on what was needed to be done. Their synergy and collective intellect provided the force for the reforms roll-out. The political cover ultimately came from prime minister Narasimha Rao, whose leadership was crucial for the success of the reforms. Rao managed to obtain key cabinet decisions and consensus without the advantage of a mechanism like the group of ministers, used extensively by his successors.By far the biggest reform of 1991 was industrial delicensing. In one swoop the licence-permit raj was dismantled, eliminating the need for permission to set up a new factory, or indeed even to add capacity to an existing factory. It is true that cement decontrol had commenced earlier in 1989, but an order affecting Indias entire industrial sector was 1991s big move. Interestingly, this particular reform was announced by the then industries minister in the forenoon of 24 July 1991the same day that finance minister Manmohan Singh gave his historic budget speech. The next days jubilant headlines missed out that crucial detail, that the licence raj had been demolished by the industries minister, who was none other than the prime minister himself.The dismantling of the suffocating licensing regime was supposed to unleash the industrial sector in a big way. Just like our East Asian peers, we should have seen a jump in the share of manufacturing in national gross domestic product (GDP). Unfortunately this promise was never fulfilled. The share of manufacturing was 16.41% in 1989-90 and is 16.2% in 2015-16 (new GDP series). If anything, it has fallen just a bit. This is a big puzzle. Additionally, even employment in the organized manufacturing sector, especially the public sector, has remained stagnant. It is true that in real terms GDP has quadrupled, which means industrial production too is four times bigger (since its share has remained constant). But it should have galloped and increased its share. The National Manufacturing Policy (NMP) aims to increase the share from the current level to 25% in the next seven years. This seems almost impossible in light of the experience of the past 25 years. The reasons for the stagnation could be many: excessive tax burden, inadequate infrastructure and connectivity, unreliable electricity, non-availability of credit or appropriately skilled labour, lack of research, development or technology adoption and so on.One of the members of the 1991 reforms team and former Reserve Bank of India deputy governor Rakesh Mohan also pointed out another troubling feature. This is manifest in Indias trade balance. If you take out the 6-7% earnings from remittances and software exports, and add 1-2% as healthy current account deficit for a growing economy like India, then our merchandise trade balance is a negative 8-9% of GDP. This is largely the shortage of industrial goods in the country. This gap reflects our inability to service our domestic market in a variety of industrial sectors, from electronics and cellphones to capital goods and machinery. Foreign imports, superior in quality and cheaper (thanks to an overvalued exchange rate), manage to swamp our markets and harness our purchasing power. E-commerce companies are probably sourcing the bulk of their merchandise through imports anyway. According to a Ficci study, the logistics cost component can be as high as 17% of the domestic cost of industrial production. (This includes the ad hoc entry taxes arbitrarily slapped on interstate movement of goods).The NMP document of 2013 already has the blueprint of what needs to be done. Initiatives like Make in India and Mudra Bank loans to small and medium entrepreneurs, the nationwide roll-out of the goods and services tax, easing of power shortagesall will cumulatively give a fillip to industrial production. But as we deal with and solve the problems of yesterday, the challenges of tomorrow are already at our doorstep. This means dealing with the rise of robotics, 3-D printing, vastly diffused and distributed value chains across countries and falling trade barriers thanks to free trade agreements. Raising the share of manufacturing in GDP: this is a hard nut to crack, but crack it we must.Ajit Ranade is chief economist at Aditya Birla Group.

0.72,"After disappointing investors on subscriber additions in the December quarter, Dish TV India Ltd has upped its game remarkably in the March quarter. The DTH (direct-to-home) services providers net subscriber additions last quarter stood at 508,000, much higher that the December quarters 317,000. Commenting on subscriber additions during the quarter, the company said that its advertising campaigns had the desired impact while the specially designed sports packs ensured that sports fans didnt go elsewhere during the cricket season.
				   
				But investors werent enthused. The stock fell nearly 6% on Monday when results were announced. To be sure, till Friday the share price had gone up by about 40% from its 2016 closing low, seen in February. Accordingly, some analysts attributed part of Mondays decline to profit booking. Nevertheless, despite impressive subscriber additions for the fourth quarter, the managements forecast of 1.5 million net subscriber additions for the current fiscal year is hardly encouraging. In fact, the lower end of FY16 guidance was the same, which the company did meet. Analysts working with higher subscriber additions for FY17 will now have to prune their numbers.Secondly, for the quarter, consolidated Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin at 32.6% was 178 basis points lower compared with the December quarter. Expectations were higher. For instance, Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd and Kotak Institutional Equities had forecast an Ebitda margin of 36% and 34.8%, respectively. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Higher-than-anticipated programming/content costs; and increase in other expenditure impacted the Ebitda margin. Still, a spike in other income and a slight decline in finance costs helped Dish TV report 17% sequential growth in pre-tax and exceptional item earnings to Rs.80 crore.Meanwhile, Arpu (average revenue per user) for the March quarter was Rs.174 compared with Rs.172 in the December quarter. Thats not bad, considering that an increase in service tax and rising share of low-priced products had made Arpu growth challenging in recent times. The company has increased prices across most of its packs in north and south India by around 4-8% with effect from 22 March. This should support Arpu growth to some extent.

Over and above, these products also reimburse customers in case of fraudulent transactions, depending on the package they buy. SBI Cards, through its card protection plan (CPP), and Oneassist, through its product wallet assist, also give customers some handy cash, which they can use to take care of themselves till they are back in their home town.These funds are extended to customers in the form of an interest-free loan, which they must repay within a stipulated period once they are back in town. These protective services are offered at an annual fee ranging between Rs.1,599 and Rs.2,499.These are types of in-built insurance services which is now offered on plastic products. Banks are not in the business of insurance, which is why we offer these third party services, said Puneet Kapoor, senior executive vice president, Kotak Mahindra Bank.According to Kapoor, his bank is proactively selling these to its debit card and credit card customers.Axis Bank, too, is in the process of marketing these third-party products to its customer base, while also offering premium cards which have these services enabled from the get go. Sangram Singh, head of card and payments at Axis Bank, said that the private sector lender also allows its customers to adjust key usages of their debit and credit cards to ensure that they are in control of the amount that is spent on them. Apart from offering these protective services, these private sector banks are also actively educating their customers on how to protect themselves against online frauds and scam phone calls where customers are asked to divulge sensitive banking information.According to an ICICI Bank spokesperson, the bank has been conducting a safe banking campaign through text messages, emails and social media posts to reach out to its customer base, for this purpose.The bank has engaged with the reputed anti-phishing agency to proactively detect and bring down phishing sites as soon as they are detected, the spokesperson said.The push for such services becomes even more relevant at a time when banks are already in the process of beefing up card security for customers who have been impacted by the recent data breach allegedly involving 3.2 million cards. SISA Information Security Pvt. Ltd is conducting a forensic investigation into the matter to determine the impact of this data breach and see what level of customer information has been compromised. The report is expected to be submitted this month.As a consequence of this data breach, State Bank of India (SBI) had announced that it will be replacing up to 600,000 cards. However, most other large banks have shied away from such a drastic step.Replacing a plastic card due to data breaches could cost the bank over Rs.100, Kapoor of Kotak Mahindra Bank confirmed. As the extent of the impact is unknown as of now, the private sector lenders havent initiated a card replacement programme yet.",2016-11-02,EHIMdaPmdN6HGZBOis8oHN,"Private banks are offering third-party services like blocking lost cards, settling hotel bills, buying air tickets if the customer is in another city when he/she lost the card",11:42,How to deal with loss of credit/debit cards and online frauds?
-0.22,"Mumbai: As the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) delays releasing guidelines for the so-called S4A (sustainable structuring of stressed assets) scheme, lenders to some of Indias most debt-ridden companies are keeping those accounts on standby.  
				   
				According to three bankers with knowledge of the matter, creditors of textile maker Alok Industries Ltd and Bhushan Steel Ltd have evaluated the books of these companies and are waiting for RBI to clear the path ahead for them to implement S4A.  As of March 2016, Bhushan Steel had consolidated debt of Rs44,477.93 crore and Alok Industries Rs22,075.15 crore.RBI introduced the S4A scheme in June, allowing banks to convert as much as half the loans held by corporate borrowers into equity or equity-like securities. The move was intended to help restore the flow of credit to crucial sectors such as infrastructure and iron and steel, among others, reduce the stress on corporate borrowers and stanch bad loans across banks.In case of Alok Industries, the evaluation study has established that less than half of the companys debt is actually sustainable. We are expecting RBI to give some leeway in the structuring of the guidelines, so this case might benefit from the restructuring, said a senior official at a state-run bank, with direct knowledge of the case. The banker spoke on condition of anonymity as the discussions are confidential.  Lenders to Alok Industries decided on a strategic debt restructuring (SDR) of the company in November 2015, the company had said in a stock exchange notification. Under this scheme, lenders would be allowed to convert part of the debt in a company to majority equity, thereby taking over operational control. In January, it said lenders planned to acquire 65% of the company by converting debt to equity under SDR.  The S4A option was considered after lenders failed to find a suitable buyer for the company.In the case of Bhushan Steel, the lending consortium led by State Bank of India (SBI) and Punjab National Bank (PNB) has conducted a forensic audit, but hasnt moved ahead on the case since it is waiting for the final S4A guidelines, said the deputy managing director of a large state-owned bank, also on conditions of anonymity.  In January-March, lenders to Bhushan Steel started classifying the account as a non-performing asset under RBIs asset quality review. This was done after efforts for debt resolution such as joint lender forum (JLF) discussions and the 5/25 refinancing plan, which allows banks to extend the tenure of infrastructure loans, failed. The JLF was set up after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested Neeraj Singhal, vice-chairman at Bhushan Steel, in the cash-for-loans case in 2014. At the monetary policy announcement on 4 October, RBI governor Urjit Patel said the regulator would announce reworked guidelines around the S4A restructuring scheme by the end of that month. The regulator had said that it was looking at changing certain aspects of the guidelines which might come in the way of practical application, such as allowing banks to classify so-called sustainable debt as a standard account. The final guidelines are yet to emerge.  There is a time component to turning around stressed assets. These cases have already seen a lot of delay in the reworking of their debt, things need to move fast now, said the second banker cited above. Alok Industries and RBI did not respond to queries mailed to them. A spokesperson for Bhushan Steel did not respond to messages sent to his cell phone.The regulator's delay in issuing revised guidelines points at RBIs need for making S4A a more inclusive restructuring mechanism. While the banking regulator does not want to seem like it is being too easy on restructuring cases, it does want to bring in more cases under S4A, the managing partner of a stressed asset consulting firm said on conditions of anonymity.Others say delays in restructuring are also a function of banks inertia.""Regulatory delays are one thing, but lenders are also not really willing to take tough calls in difficult situations. Most public sector banks seem to be too scared of vigilance-related investigations, which acts as a deterrent when they have to decide on taking big haircuts during such turnaround cases, the head of the restructuring practice at a global consulting firm said, also seeking anonymity.According to the S4A norms issued by the central bank in June, banks are allowed to split the debt of a stressed company into sustainable and unsustainable parts.  According to RBI norms, the unsustainable debt can be converted into long-term, equity-like instruments that will be on a banks investment books while the rest of the debt can be restructured.Under S4A norms, promoters will be required to dilute their shareholding in exchange for converting a part of the unsustainable debt into equity. These promoters shares would be given to banks, which will continue to hold them till a company turns around, after which lenders can sell the equity.  Promoters will continue to have the first right of refusal to these shares.  Most other restructuring options on offer have not delivered satisfactory results, resulting in higher accumulation of bad loans on the books of banks, which collectively hold Rs6.3 trillion of non-performing assets.",2016-11-07,EJzIYX2yzAzPfPgv2Dg8DJ,The creditors of Alok Industries and Bhushan Steel are waiting for RBI to issue fresh guidelines,00:49,Lenders put top NPA cases on standby over S4A norms delay
0.7,"Mumbai: The ongoing crisis in the $103 billion conglomerate is unlikely to impact Brand Tata, said Harish Bhat, chairman of Tata Global Beverages Ltd and brand custodian of the group. 
				   
				In an interview, he said that it was business as usual in all the operating companies even though the current spat had been tough to deal with at a personal level. Edited excerpts:As the custodian of the Tata brand are you concerned about brand erosion?First and foremost, the Tata brand is the result of many decades of initiatives which have to do with providing excellent products and service to our customers, which have to do with providing value back to the community, and which have to do with the highest level of corporate governance. So, this is a brand which has been built assiduously over several decades. Second is the consumers,  who buy our services and brands. Their trust in the Tata brand remains unchanged. Has the Tata brand been affected with respect to stakeholders?I would say this controversy perhaps has to some extent impacted the way some stakeholders look at the brand, and we will need to build on the brand and nurture it in the future, bearing that in mind.(Cyrus) Mistry has alleged some governance violations. As a representative of the chairman office of Tata Sons, how do you respond to that?Firstly, to have a chairman who is in open hostility with the promoter company puts at risk all the shareholders of the company. The company uses the brand name of the primary promoter company. There are credit ratings the company enjoys. People work in the company because it is part of a larger group. There are collaborations with joint venture partners which have been supported by Tata Sons.The other fact you mentioned is also very relevant. The board governance guidelines which was adopted by the board of Tata Global Beverages Ltd (TGBL) very clearly specified that if you were an employee of the company and if you were a non-executive director on the board of another Tata company and if you moved out of employment in your primary company, then you would also immediately resign from the boards of operating companies where you were a non-executive director. This was clause 2.9 of board governance guidelines which was adopted by the board of TGBL. It was adopted unanimously by the board, and the board at that time was chaired by Mistry.ALSO READ | What does Cyrus Mistry gain by trashing the Tata group?So, the question is now Mistry should also follow these guidelines which he has not done. I do believe that this is violation of the board governance guidelines. This is the second reason why we felt he should be replaced. This has been clearly mentioned in the appeal that Tata Sons has put out to all shareholders earlier this month.Isnt he still a director on the board of Tata Sons and hence an employee?A non-executive director is not an employee. He was an employee of Tata Sons until he was the chairman of Tata Sons.What about the allegations he has made about governance of the operating companiesTata Sons and Tata Trusts?I have been on the board of several operating companies of the group, and I must say that they are run independently by their own boards of directors. Our boards debate and discuss what the future strategy of the company should be, what the capital allocation should be. Those are decisions taken by the boards of the respective companies. As far as I am concerned, my experience on the boards of the companies is that the companies are independently run, are supervised by very competent boards composed of very competent and reputed independent and non-independent directors.What happens if in certain EGMs Mistry is not voted out?First and foremost I want to preface my answer to that to say that Tata Sons has issued an appeal to all our shareholders. Ratan Tata, our interim chairman has also written a letter to all our shareholders. In these letters and appeals, we have put forward our case very strongly on why the continued presence of Mistry on the boards of our operating companies can be disruptive and dysfunctional to those companies. The appeal from Tata Sons has also pointed out the corporate governance violation, which I discussed a little while ago. I am very confident that the shareholders will take those appeals and letters into account before deciding how they will vote in the best interests of the companies where they hold equity stake.ALSO READ | Tata Motors emerges as key battle in Tata vs Mistry fightFor any reason, if the situation arises, as you are describing it, then it is up to the board of Tata Sons to decide what they would like to do. What next now? How do you resolve this dispute?We have EGMs coming up next week. In those EGMs,  there are resolutions which Tata Sons has moved. Those resolutions will get voted upon. We are very keen to put the focus and spotlight very clearly on profitable growth of each operating firm within the company so that we can run as fast as required to create the right level of shareholder value. Is the group prepared for a long legal battle?The group will do whatever is right to safeguard our shareholders and safeguard all our stakes.Can you share with us whats top of your mind now?There are 2-3 things. First and foremost, I want to use this opportunity to pay tribute to all the operating companies of Tata group. Over the last few weeks, while this issue has been very actively discussed in media and in public forums, we must recognize and appreciate that for all our operating companies it has been business as usual. Also, at a personal level, the last few weeks have been very difficult for me, but not so difficult at a professional level. Let me explain why. At a personal level its difficult because any such situation for a person like me, who has been part of the Tata group for 30 years now, I think it creates anxiety. On the other hand, at a professional level, I have always borne in mind I should do what is right for the institution.ALSO READ | What if other Tata group shareholders vote the same way as those at TCS?Can you tell how you will restore the brand value which has been impacted to some extent?Two or three things. One is the principles on which the brand has been built remain unchanged. We do what is right by all our stakeholders, and they include our consumers, our financial shareholders, community, vendor partners and value chain partners and, of course, our employees.You were also a part of the group executive council under Cyrus Mistry. We understand that he was about to present a governance document which would define the relationship between Tata Sons, the trusts and the operating companies. Can you share something of that?I do not want to share in this interview any information about any documents that were being discussed in confidence. I hope you appreciate my point of view here. Having said that, yes, I was a member of the operating council under Mistry. There were specific roles that he had assigned to me in the GEC which were to do with customer-centric promoting, customer centricity and customer excellence in the group. They were to do with providing marketing support to some of the new businesses that we were incubating within Tata Sons.Were you a part of those discussions?Some discussions I was a part of, some I was not. There were discussions on many matters within the GEC. On the specific question you have asked on the governance document, I would not like to comment.Why is it that almost all the directors of Tata Global Beverages who have voted against Mistry have filed caveats against him in the Bombay high court?I do not want to comment on any legal matters. I believe the company will do whatever is right under the law.TGBL is the only listed company that has not called an EGM to remove Mistry as director?It is up to Tata Sons to decide if they want to call an EGM and in what order. Whenever Tata Sons calls the EGM, if they do and when they do, then we will have the EGM.Can you tell us what happened at the TGBL board meeting on 15 November? What was the need to move the circular resolution later? Is it an admission that it was not all kosher at the board meeting?No, absolutely not. The board meeting was conducted in strict adherence to the process of law. Whatever was the legal process required to introduce a resolution was followed to the T. Thats the first point I would like to make. I have already mentioned in an earlier interview that the reason I moved that resolution in the board meeting is because I believe, and eventually as you know seven out of 10 board members voted for that resolution, that Mr Mistrys continued presence as chairman of the board while he was also at the same time in an adversarial and hostile relationship with the primary promotor Tata Sons would be very harmful to the interests of the shareholders of TGBL.The circular resolution which was moved thereafter was without prejudice to the board meetings. It was just to re-emphasise the fact that a majority of directors were strongly in support of replacing Mistry as the chairman of the board for all the risks I pointed out earlier.What about the video recording. Why was it not made available to Mistry?Mistrys correspondence was with the company secretary of Tata Global Beverages and to the best of my knowledge the company secretary of Tata Global Beverages has responded to Mistry. I would also like to say that the law provides for the minutes of the meeting which have been recorded by the company secretary to be finalized within a period of time in case the video recording for some reason is not available. That legal process was also followed completely.In his representation to Tata Sons, Nusli Wadia said that in the case of Tata Steel, the founding fathers had given the company the name since 1907. Tata Steel existed much before Tata Sons and the brand agreement was signed only in 1998 so this needs to be examined and addressed. What are your views?I am very clear that the Tata trademark is owned by Tata Sons. The ownership of the trademark is with Tata Sons. Under a brand equity licence agreement, operating companies of the group use the trademark. So, those two facts are very clear to me and beyond that I dont want to add anything because trademark ownership is an established law in our country and indeed all parts of the world. We are also very clear that Tata Sons has added a lot of value to the Tata brand name.Do you think the independence of operating companies will be curtailed in the future?Each operating company of the Tata company is an independent organization. The board of directors of each individual company, whether it be of Titan (Co. Ltd) or Tata Global Beverages or Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), or any company of the group, the board of directors of that individual company is the one that guides the organization, which provides the strategic and governance framework for that company. We have a very competent board of directors with very competent independent and non-independent directors on each board. Having said that, each operating company of the Tata group does not exist in a vacuum. It exists as a part of the larger Tata group and I think it benefits greatly...like the use of the Tata trademark, credit rating and talent acquisition. So, you are saying that it will be status quo in the way that they are operating?I also want to say that, some of us who represent Tata Sons on the boards of these operating companies, what we do and what the entire board does is ensure that we try to maximize values for our entire shareholders into the future.Does profitable growth also entail exiting companies, which seems to be a bone of contention?(Ratan) Tatas letter to the shareholders has specified that very clearly. He has addressed the issue. He said very clearly that as a promoter, Tata Sons constantly evaluates new business opportunities and investments. Some of these investments have been successful while some others have taken time to be profitable. Our approach has been to support and fund these businesses during their development and growth phases. He has also mentioned that we will exit the business when we believe it is inviable.What are your views on where the group is headed with all these changes?See, my belief is that Tata Group is not just a corporation. It is an institution. It is an institution which is now 149 years of age. Its strongly embedded in some values which I think are dear to the institution. It symbolizes trust, it symbolizes the highest levels of corporate governance and it symbolizes doing good for the community or being a good corporate citizen. Those three fundamental pillars of the Tata brand will remain unchanged.R. Krishna Kumar, a trustee and director on the Tata Sons board, had in an earlier interview with the media shared that a succession plan for Tata Trusts is being discussed. This vindicates Cyrus Mistrys stand with respect to the governance structure of Tata Trusts, that it needs to be reworked.I do not want to comment on that. I am not part of the Tata Trusts. My relationship has been far more with Tata Sons and the operating companies. Thats a decision for Tata Sons to take. I do not wish to comment on the statement he has made.Given that you have worked Mistry for 3-3.5 years, did you see this coming?My working was with respect to all the functions he had allocated to me. And as far as Tata Sons is concerned, I do not have the visibility and would not like to comment on that. I have not been privy to those discussions and would not like to comment on that.How was it working with Mistry?I must mention this very clearly that I hold Mistry in very good personal regard. I have worked closely with him and the opportunity that he gave me to work as a member of the GEC and the specific role he gave me within the GEC. I have had several discussions with him. Those discussions were very cordial, very professional. I must say that I have not had the time so far over the last several weeks as you will no doubt realize to sit down and reflect on all those three years. But may be sometime in the future, I will do so.Was he a tough boss?How do you define tough. He was a boss who heard me out on areas I discussed with him and he would give me whatever decisions I wanted. If there was a specific area that he thought required far more intense work, he would tell me that.How is it that you and Mukund Rajan were retained and the other members of the GEC were let go?I can only talk about my performance appraisal. I also would not like to comment on other members of the GEC. I can only talk about the role I played. I did my role to the best of my capability. Whatever role was given to me, which I have already mentioned earlier. Now its up to Tata Sons and my boss at Tata Sons to judge how I performed.",2016-12-17,EReffw5Q2VhEVa25BzNgDN,Tata Global Beverages chairman Harish Bhat says its business as usual in all group firms though the Tata vs Mistry spat is tough to deal with at a personal level,02:38,Trust in the Tata brand remains unchanged: Harish Bhat
0.42,"Mumbai: Infrastructure company Essel Infraprojects Ltd on Saturday agreed to buy two build, operate, and transfer (BOT) road assets from Patel Engineering Ltd and KNR Constructions Ltd for an enterprise value of Rs.850 crore, including debt. 
				   
				Essel Infraprojects roads subsidiary Essel Highways Ltd has been looking to expand its portfolio of road projects by way of acquisitions. In August, Essel Highways had secured $85 million loan from investment bank Goldman Sachs as part of a $220-million debenture issuance to finance new projects and for strategic acquisitions. Patel Engineering and KNR Constructions will sell their entire equity stake in two annuity-based BOT projects, namely Patel KNR Infrastructure Ltd (PKIL) and Patel KNR Heavy Infrastructure Ltd (PKHIL) to the Essel group company, KNR Constructions said in a BSE filing on Saturday.Patel Engineering and affiliates hold about 60% stake in each of the two assets, while the remaining 40% is with KNR. The two projects have a combined debt of about Rs.780 crore, a person familiar with the projects said. KNR Constructions plans to focus on its EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) business by exiting the asset-heavy BOT business, while the sale will help Patel Engineering improve its financial liquidity. Several road companies are going back to the EPC model, where investments and risks are lower and are beginning to demerge or monetize their operational BOT assets. Investment bank Equirus Capital acted as the exclusive transaction advisors to KNR Constructions and Patel Engineering. Both the assets are operational on the annuity-based model and were awarded by the national Highways Authority of India (NHAI), the statement said adding that the transaction is subject to certain conditions precedent including lenders and NHAI approvals. The deal is likely to close in the next two-three months time. The transaction is in line with the trend seen across the roads sector where institutional money is chasing operational cash-flows and helping in debt reduction of infrastructure conglomerates, said Ajay Garg, managing director of Equirus Capital. Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas acted as the legal advisors to the two sellers while Luthra and Luthra law offices advised Essel on this transaction. Essel Highways, which was set up in 2007, has assets valued at about $1.8 billion.

0.24,"Paris: Facebook and Google are the 800-pound gorillas in online advertising because of audience reach and superior targeting. They enjoy another lesser-known advantage: theyre largely immune to ad blocking.
				   
				People install ad blockers to strip out marketing messages and the trackers used to target ads. Theyre more widespread on computers but theyre migrating slowly to mobile too. Analysts estimate that ad blocking cost web publishers nearly $22 billion in lost ad sales last year, compared with total internet ad sales of $160 billion.Yet its becoming clear that the pain isnt being shared equally, and this is more bad news for newspaper, magazine, and television companies. What started as a consumer movement sparked by rage about intrusive ads, security and privacy seems to be strengthening the internets big beasts.Not only does old world media lack the tech chops to beat the blockers, their fragile finances make it hard to turn away ad dollars in the name of user experience. Google and Facebooks resources dwarf the legacy publishers. But even when looked at on a proportional basis, old medias investment in its own future is anemic. Last year, Google spent 16.4% of revenue on R&D, according to Bloomberg data, and Facebook almost a quarter. At Daily Mail & General Trust, owner of one of the most popular news sites, it was 3.6%.Facebook is a textbook example of how technology enshrines advantage. While it was prey to ad blockers when most users preferred computers, its played a blinder in the shift to mobile. The ads within the mobile Facebook app (and its photo-sharing app Instagram) cant be stripped out by blockers. Theyre delivered by Facebook servers with none of the usual identifiers.Googles main defence is its iron grip on search ads. These paid-for links, which appear by results when users look for information on plane fares or movie tickets, arent as annoying as pop-up ads or videos. One caveat: Googles display advertising, such as banner ads or videos on YouTube, is more threatened by ad blockers than Facebooks. Unlike the social media giant, Google ads arent sheltered within an app.Yet this is small comfort for traditional media. Once ad blocking usage hits about 20% of the population, it really starts to hurt publishers, according to John Montgomery of WPPs GroupM. The New York Times and others are desperate for online ads to make up the shortfall from print, but its hard going as the chart below shows. Falling prices for their online ads, which cannot match the targeting precision of Facebook or Google, are the main culprit, but ad blockers arent helping.Since most publishers rely on external networks to sell their online ad space, the ads are easily identified and cut out by blockers. Efforts to coax people to turn off the blockers are becoming common, but have yet to prove effective. Blocking increases pressure on free sites such as the Daily Mail and Guardian to impose paywalls. But its tough to sell general news, which is freely available elsewhere.One answer could be to turn to the web giants for help. A year ago, Facebook created a tool that hosts publishers content within the social network, theoretically taking them off the ad blockers radars too. Google has a similar initiative.Yet such assistance isnt free and makes old media ever more dependent on Silicon Valley for its future. Hardly a secure prospect for a beleaguered industry.

What is it? The estimated combined revenue of a proposed merger of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular.Why is it important? The all-share merger will create Indias largest telecom company, larger than the Rs-50,008-crore-earning Bharti Airtel. Debt on both the companies books and likely losses incurred from the tariff-reduction race started by Reliance Jio are being seen as triggers for the move. It looks like a much needed consolidation boost in the 22-circle Indian telecom market, as seen from the stock gains of Indian telecom operators yesterday ranging 8-10% with Idea gaining a record 26%.Tell me more: The merged entry would still have to address, in many markets, the telecom regulators anti-monopoly restrictions of owning no more than 50% of spectrum in a band and 25% of available spectrum in a circle (or geographic market). 1 dayWhat is it? Number of days to go before the RBI-mandated daily ATM withdrawal limit of Rs 10,000 is removed, from February 1.Why is it important? The first sign of reverting to pre-demonetisation days of cash management was made with RBIs circular removing the ATM limit. Two weeks ago, RBI signalled its ease in handling cash by expanding the limit to Rs 10,000 from Rs 4,500. The Rs 24,000-weekly limit on savings-bank withdrawal, however, stays put, but restrictions on current account, cash credit and overdraft accounts will be removed. Tell me more: RBI mentions the savings-bank limit is under consideration for withdrawal in the near future. Banks can use their discretion to set their own operating limits at ATMs as was the practice before old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were withdrawn.42What is it? The number of cases the Income Tax (IT) department registered nationwide under the recently-enforced Benami Transactions Act.Why is it important? Warnings in public advertisements by the IT department against depositing unaccounted old currency in someone elses bank account anonymously are materialising now. The Benami Acts section 24 has been invoked for 87 notices, for attaching bank accounts with crores of rupees of such dubious deposits and an immovable property.Tell me more: These cases, if proven true, would attract a heavy penalty and a rigorous jail-term of a maximum of seven years. 4What is it? The number of new administrators appointed by the Supreme Court to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).Why is it important? The neutral committee headed by former Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), and the current Chairman of Banks Board Bureau, Vinod Rai, will pave the path to reform the embattled BCCI, richest sporting body in India and the most profitable cricket board in the world. The team, with a mix of financial acumen, social perspective and cricketing enthusiasm, is tasked with bringing in accounting rigour and good governance to a body mired in controversies, the latest being its earlier president and secretary sacked on January 3. It would also finalise the Indian Premier Leagues 10th edition besides reporting on the Lodha panel recommendations to the court.Tell me more: The other members are Vikram Limaye, managing director and CEO of IDBI Bank; former Indian womens cricket captain Diana Edulji; and historian and writer Ramchandra Guha. Limaye will represent BCCI in an ICC meeting in February. The committee has no term limit.650What is it? The number of branches of the India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) to be set up by September, 2017.Why is it important? The IPPB will locate these branches in postal district headquarters which would enable all the post office branches under those head offices to be served by the payments bank.

0.6,"At 62, Max Group founder Analjit Singh is trim and fit and says he is at peace with himselfa state of mind achieved because he doesnt feel the need for habra any more. Translated from Punjabi, that means he is no longer in a tearing hurry, as he was 30 years ago.
				   
				In January, Analjit Singh stepped down as chairman of the group he founded in 1982 and built into a Rs15,000 crore empire, with interests in life insurance; health and allied businesses; and speciality packaging films. In August, the board of Max Life Insurance Co. Ltd signed off on a merger with HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd that will create Indias largest private-sector insurer, with Rs1.1 trillion in assets.The promoters of Max Financialessentially Analjit Singh, his family and related family firmswill hold a 6.5% stake in the merged company and also get a non-compete fee of Rs850 crore. Analjit Singh, who within Max Group is called BAS (short for Bhai Analjit Singh, bhai being an honorific meaning brother), doesnt like being called a promoter, preferring the term sponsor, and seems to have achieved what most business family owners can only think of wistfullya degree of detachment from the business that allows him to take decisions without any emotional baggage.Analjit Singh stands out among the top echelons of business leadership in India for his ability to spot an opportunity like he did with telecom (Singh made Rs561 crore in 1998 by selling his 41% stake in a joint venture with Hutchison Whampoa Ltd)  and insurance and healthcare early on, and  more than that to quit when on top. He ascribes that to foresight and luck; but in reality, it is the mark of a businessman who can read the tea leaves.Analjit Singh, with the reputation of a serial entrepreneur, is also exploring new businesses, including information technology, real estate and education, under Max Ventures and Industries Ltd (MVIL). In an interview at his elegant home on New Delhis tony Abul Kalam Azad Road, Analjit Singh patiently explained his philosophy of life, his current state of mind and how the two relate to his business. Edited excerpts:As a strategic businessman, what are the things you are looking at now? When you look at these opportunities, what excites you the most?
I am not so sure that people in my situation look at entrepreneurial opportunities from purely a new-world perspective, as you pointed out. I think they look at entrepreneurial and future opportunities in rather a traditional way but think of these developments as enablers.What is the traditional way?
It is perspective of the market, key differentiators, compatibility of extensive weaknesses of the individual and the firm to be able to do something like this. So, therefore, in the traditional criteria of finding these opportunities what I meant was market, differentiator, opportunities, regulation...new factor, completely new factor in the decision-making set. The market is over-crowded. Everybody is in the business of over-promising and under-delivering. Capital is no longer a constraint like it was before. To some extent, even technology is no longer a constraint to those people who have some experience and network, you can find the technology. Anything is possible. If you run a world-class airline, technology is available. So, execution is the key. Team is a big factor. Team was never a question in our mind in the past 10-15 years. Today, if I were looking to be in a big business, probably the first question that I will ask apart from market and differentiator is people and team; and then you look at these new-world solutions that you are talking about as how they can become enablers to what they can do.Besides that, this question is not so pertinent to me. I am not super-engaged to be so rattled about what am I going to do and what will be my next big play. It is not top-most of my mind.But you will do new things, right?
I will do new things, but I will say I am not besotted with it anymore. My interest is more to tame myself and tame my mind and tame my life. Do you know this word habra? I have no habra.Were you like that when you did the diversification?
Of course not! Thirty years ago, I was always in a rush.If you forget about the future for now and look at the past 16 years, what are the things that you have picked up?
I dont call myself a promoter. I prefer the word sponsor. I think if a sponsor does not have an affinity with the business, that business unless by luck things take-off, I think that business drags. The affinity of a sponsor to a particular business segment is very important. If (Bharti Airtel Ltd founder) Sunil Mittal did not have an affinity for telecom or for technology, Airtel would not have been what it is today (Indias biggest phone services provider). If I did not have an affinity for being in the businesses of life and, therefore, focus on healthcare and insurance for 15-16 years, it wouldnt have worked.Affinity and focus leads to execution, passion capital, heavy-lifting, good team equals to success. Therefore, you can apply that mantra to anythingold world or new world. What would you call an old-world business? Pick anything. If I say to myself that I am going to leave everything in my life and get into steel and cement, I will find a new way of doing it and I will be successful in 5-7 years. I will find a way because the need for steel and cement is not gone. If you do it as another unit with the traditional way and traditional people, it is a recipe for disaster. So, we have to find an IndiGo (Indias biggest airline) way of getting in steel or cement. IndiGo is a very good example of what I am saying. What is the revolution and reinvention of being in the airline business? People have been in the airline business. They are in the airline business. They will be in the airline business, but most companies fail. So, why is IndiGo successful? Do you think (IndiGo co-founder) Rahul Bhatia goes and fixes the tyres of the plane every day? No. But somewhere between Aditya (Ghosh, IndiGo president) and him, the way they work is set. So, the way we work in insurance and healthcare is set, and everybody then would perform to that tune. Thats because you have affinity. Thats a clear lesson and experience that I can share.Somebody asked me the other day that you are not even now non-executive chairman of your companies. I am of the MVIL (Max Ventures India Ltd) because I am having fun again after 30 years to nurture a new company. Of those, you are of Vodafone.My point there was: to be a non-executive chairman of a company where you are a sponsor is very different from a non-executive chairman of a company where you are not a sponsor. My remake, role, life, expectations, contact, engagement, communication has to be very different if I am a non-executive chairman of a Max company. The deliverables and expectations are different when it comes to  being non-executive chairman of Vodafone. I am not a sponsor. They dont have the same expectation.When do you as a promoter decide that it is time that you should become a sponsor? Let us assume that this second wave of successful diversification that you did were not successful, would you still be saying all this?
So, in a way, it also gets linked to your expectations from future and living with disappointments from your past. Thats in a way what you are saying. I think the honest answer has to be that if the outcomes were not as exciting as they have been, I think, I would have not been as restful in my mind about it as I am appearing right now. I think thats possibly the case, but it also means in my current way of thinking that I would have to work harder at myself to become restful about the disappointments of the past.So, luckily for meand luck is a factor or the blessing that I havethe way I see it from nature and everything else is that these have moved reasonably in tandem. If they had not, the stretch would have been more and one would have to work harder to overcome those disappointments.Is there someone else in your fraternity who has done this really well? Is there a role model?
I wont go to the extent of saying whether I have a role model. I wont say that I am looking at somebody and say look how he did it. But I can tell you who has done it and done it very successfully. He is Vikram Lal (promoter of Eicher Motors Ltd). He is very restful and peaceful as a person. Look what has happened to Eicher. He wanted a particular life for some reason and he went after it and he has got it.I so solidly believe in impermanence that for me to be attached to a business, in this case, life insurance, it is stupid to be attached to it. When life is impermanent then what is this stigma about a business being permanent. Today, when you look at it, the power of this sector in this business is moving to banks. Whether these (insurance) companies are going to be profitable or not will not be because our premiums will get higher. We have the highest persistency (a measure of policy renewals) in the country84%. It is unheard of. The No. 2 company is 63%. So, I cant have more persistency in this business. The banks are now controlling distribution virtually. So, the only way to improve profitability is expense management. So, power shifting from agency to bankers, premiums not going up, expense management, regulators everywhere in this world are tightening the screws on the companies. Solvency margin, shareholder profits, expense allowance and disallowance, participating account versus shareholder account. No. 3 some sort of going back to expense management and market share, some sort of geographies have emerged for different companies. We are very strong in Gujarat; Gujarat is our second or third largest territory. But, more or less, we are more strong in the north and the south than we are in the west or east. HDFC (Life) is more strong in the west and the south than they are in the north. So, if you take the bank they are, you take the opportunity to consolidate and, therefore, cut some unessential costs and you take the link and fourth, product. In our time, we were heavily into protection and savings products. Even today, 80% of our business comes from protection and savings products, not from ULIPs (unit-linked insurance plans) and the like. HDFC is other way around, may be two-third or one-third.These are the four things that I saw writing on the wall about. And I have to tell you that when as a sponsor, among the 23 or 24 companies that are in life (insurance), if you take the balance sheet of the sponsor, we must be one of the smallest, I think. So from being in that position to sitting at No.3 of 23-24 with all the names you know sitting below us, you can get spoilt; and then, one fine day, because of these four factors, nobody gives you notice of failure in life like you never get notice of death.The same is in this business, some things just happen, and they change and then all of a sudden you say, oh shit what has happened?Six months ago, we were like this. And you come from 3 to 6 to 8 to 9. I dont want to take that chance; but then, it will go back to the question you asked me that if at the end of all this it was not good, would you have felt the same thing and I would have said no and I would have to start again, building again. I can see it happening, but my responsibility is I must not let it happen. Here is my opportunity that God has sent to me, I must take it.But you do take impulsive decisions? You do take decisions on the basis of your instinct?
Of course, you do.In South Africa, for instance.
Of course, I did. But hang on, yes and no. The impulsive decision that was taken about South Africa was not for business. The impulsive decision was to want to be there and enjoy the location. Like I may have a home. So, that was the impulsive decision. When it started to go away from becoming a holiday home or retreat to business, then I am very conscious, not impulsive. So, today that operation is being run exactly like any company of the Max group, with a board, people, CEOs, accountability, targets, budgets, matrix and data.Is it a part of the Max group?
No, no, private. Max has nothing to do with it.Could you elaborate a little bit, what is it about?
It is about hospitality, lifestyle, hotels, rooms, agriculture, plums, wines, almonds, wine-making, selling wines, three hotels, beer. We have a similar property in the UK. The first property is Linthwaite (Lake District Hotel, Linthwaite House), which is in the UK. So, we will grow in the UK. We have just acquired it in April. On 25 April, we took over.Whats the vision for it?
I have always wanted to be in the hospitality business. When I started vision 2000 of Max, I picked four areas: it was insurance, healthcare, education and hospitality. When we got cracking on insurance and healthcare, we did not have five rupees, or five minutes or five calories of energy to invest in anything other than insurance and healthcare; so we left it at that. In a way, Antara (homes for senior citizens) and remotely Vana (wellness resort) were born out of this idea of hospitality. And now, I am starting my life in education. Education is one of them, but it is a little too premature to talk about. In education, we have started some work. Are we engaged in it? Yes, but what are we going do, I dont know. But we have decided to be in that sector, so I dont know whether its 0 to 11 or KG to 16.Is someone thinking about this?
Yes. Very much. But just now, in August, its too soon for me to say whether its going to be Boeing or Airbus or north only or all India or only abroad... But it will be top three. I just like that expression of top three. And it should be, otherwise whats the point?Why are you interested in the real estate business?
I have a bit of khurak (itch) here. Actually, my grandfather was in the contracting business. That was my great grandfathers business in Pakistan. The bhai family were contractors. They built the road from India to Burma as a case in point. So, even now, you go to Lahore and all, and you will see a lot of buildings built by them. People in the street remember them as a family. So, I have a khurak for civil, real estate and stuff. I like land. I like construction, I like design. I like building. Every time the economy is on the cusp, and every time we talk about India being the next big thing... there are sections which are being talked about such as manufacturing, real estate, education... Do you see the economy like that?
I do and on the manufacturing side, I cant tell you anything today. I hope I can tell you in 60 days. We will, if all goes well, we will be in that space, in the prime ministers central part of his vision... Make in India. I will give you a beautiful project, if it succeeds, I dont know, I cant tell you today, we are working on it. I cant tell you what it is today. But if it succeeds, Mr. (Narendra) Modi will use this as an example of Make in India.Manufacturing is huge right? Its like a huge umbrella.
Our manufacturing space is only in one sector, which is polymers area. I am talking about that area, I am not talking about planes or furniture or phones or cars. Lets see. See, we never looked at anything else all these years. Thats why I coined this expression that I will look now at WWOBwider world of business. Education is that. Differentiated real estate is that. Investing is that. Everybody did investment. Other than financial services companies, people didnt use investing as a business. And you dont have to be financial investor to invest. So, investing will be a vertical of ours. Could be in shoes, could be in water, could be in plants.Do you see growth opportunities in the healthcare business?
Huge growth opportunities. Healthcare, if done and executed right. But most people will not be able to get it right. Most people will try and fail because of the population in our country, because of a very small percentage of it that can actually access healthcare, because of technology in this sector.Answer to your question is Alpha. But we worked 10-15 years to create that foundation. In Saket we will build the single largest hospital in Asia. But why we have not broken the ground there because we are not designing the hospital that is not so difficult to do. We are designing an ecosystem around Saket with a world class company who is doing all the planning and master planning for us.Which is this company?
HKS Architects. So we would change the shape of that part of Saket.So its a complete revamp?

				The companys per-tonne steel realization shows an increase of just 0.5% over a year ago. What saved the quarter for Sail was a decline in its raw material costs.Sails revenue declined by 2.7% from a year ago to Rs.9,238 crore, while its operating profit improved to Rs234 crore compared with Rs89 crore. A sequential comparison is not possible due to the shift to Ind-AS accounting standards from the current quarter.Although its operating profit has improved, an increase in depreciation and finance costs, and a decline in other income has contributed to a loss of Rs535 crore versus a loss of Rs248 crore in the year-ago period.The substantial widening of its loss is what may have caused the 5.68% decline in its share on Friday.Sails share has been gaining ground in the past three months to 9 September,  and is up by 12.9% compared with a 21.4% increase in the BSE Metal Index. Although its operating margin has improved, it is not enough to cover the increase seen in depreciation and interest costs.The scenario for steel companies had improved with the imposition of anti-dumping duty and minimum import price on steel imports. The months of July and August have seen some improvement in Sails output, on a sequential basis. A gradual pick-up in sales will give investors confidence that its output can reach higher levels, justifying the investments it is making in adding to steel capacity.The outlook for domestic steel prices has improved with the government lending support and global prices rising. Domestic demand remains a worry though. In April-August, steel consumption rose by only 1.3% over a year ago, according to data from the Joint Plant Committee. However, an increase in exports and a decline in imports is supporting an increase in domestic production.Investors will be happy even if Sails output does not increase by much but is able to report a much higher jump in profits.

0.91,"The Tata Power Co. Ltd stock gained 2.4% on Wednesday after the company reported a profit of Rs336 crore for the September quarter. In the year-ago quarter it lost Rs96 crore.
				   
				The firm benefited from higher coal prices, dividend income and low finance costs. Barring two units, all key subsidiaries generated operating profits and  several reported better operating profits.The coal business was the star performer. As prices rose, the firm sold 14% more coal. True, high prices have hurt its ultra-mega power plant at Mundra, Gujarat. Under-recoveries rose and losses at the plant continued. But that did not come as a surprise as the plant was anyway stuck in unfavourable offtake agreements. What stood out is better operating performance. Availability of the plant roseits up from 77% a year ago to 85% in the last quarter. This improved fixed cost recovery.Revenues at the stand-alone company level fell due to low power demand and offtake. But that did not percolate to earningsprofit was up 26% at the stand-alone levelthanks to high dividend from shipping and investment subsidiaries.Overall the performance was satisfactory. Tata Power revised downwards the previously agreed sale consideration for its Indonesian asset PT Arutmin. But the change in consideration is due to adjustments related to prior period liabilities, past claims and statutory obligation and not due to valuation write-down, the company clarified, says an analyst who attended the conference call.ALSO READ | Tata Power cuts sale consideration for Arutmin mine in Indonesia to $246 mnThe recent rebound in coal rates is likely to benefit Tata Power in the current quarter also. Of course, firm coal prices will undermine the Mundra power plants profitability. But as analysts point out, at the company level Tata Power is net long on coal, in terms of its share in coal generation and usage at the Mundra plant. So it can see material benefits from higher coal prices.That does not mean investors should overlook losses at the Mundra plant, which has been a wealth destroyer in recent years. Due to large investment, resolution of compensation (for cost under-recoveries) for this plant remains a key earnings trigger for the company and for the stock. Our sensitivity analysis suggests a likely tariff hike of (around) 39 paise for Mundra for FY17, which will translate into PBT of Rs5.7 billion vs reported loss of Rs2.1 billion in FY16, Ambit Capital Pvt.

With the renewable-power purchase obligations of power distribution utilities, falling prices of imported solar panels from China and concessional taxation on solar panels, the industry has been growing rapidly, resulting in falling tariffs and a boost for electrical equipment manufacturing and services.According to a report issued this month by clean energy research firm Mercom Capital Group, renewable energy project development has changed significantly over the last quarter largely due to Chinese module price declines. The average selling prices of Chinese modules in India have declined about 10% since August and by about 30% over the last 12 months. This has provided a much-needed boost to developers which won projects at low bids and were struggling to make project economics work, said the report.According to Ashish Khanna, executive director and chief executive of Tata Power Solar Systems Ltd, a stronger focus on solar panel and equipment manufacturing, better access to finance and streamlined import duties on panels and system components will go a long way in reaching the 100GW target.",2017-01-25,FnIG8NQF4o2YeE8NbQtzgP,"Twenty firms, including Enel Green Power, SoftBank-promoted SBG Cleantech, Canadian Solar Energy, have expressed interest in the mega solar project in Madhya Pradesh",01:09,Madhya Pradesh woos global investors with mega solar project

RBI asked banks to reclassify some of these accounts as NPAs, or make higher provisions against them. The banks were given time until 31 March 2016 to do this. While the impact of these bad loans had been expected to fade by 31 March, state-owned banks and some large private sector lenders have continued to make higher provisions in the first two quarters of this financial year. Incremental NPAs, however, are much lower than what they were in the October-March period of the last fiscal year.Allahabad Banks net interest income (NII), or the difference between interest earned on loans and that paid on deposits, during the July-September period fell 17% to Rs1,349.43 crore year-on-year.

				Revenue and volume are up 18% from a year ago. As has been the case in recent quarters, Latin America led the growth with a 37% rise in revenue. What came as a surprise though is a strong 20% growth in the India business.A combination of dry spells, delayed crop seasons and demonetization-induced disruption to business has reduced growth expectations of  agrochemical companies. Validating that view, Rallis India Ltd recently reported a subdued 8% growth for the December quarter despite a favourable base.UPLs India business also has the benefit of a favourable baserevenue in Q3 last fiscal was down 17%. Even then, as one analyst with a domestic broking firm points out, the growth is stronger than expectations. A crop shift in favour of pulses, soyabean, oilseeds and corn resulted in improved demand for herbicides, which helped drive the top line, Sharekhan said in a note.In Latin America, the company benefited from better crop area and yield improvements in Brazil, a large market for UPL in terms of revenue. Its insecticide brands did well due to the high infestation of sucking insect in soybean. In North America, the business was flat as low incomes made farmers wary of investing in agriculture inputs. Business in Europe grew 8%. Its herbicides products did well, the company said in its results presentation.While revenue in the rest of the countries grew 2%, Latin America and India stood as major growth drivers for UPL. In a conference call with analysts, the management maintained a 12-15% revenue growth forecast and 60-100 basis points expansion in operating margin.Achieving the growth guidance may not look challenging, especially with revenue already rising 14% so far this fiscal.But the growth outlook in the current quarter is less sanguine. The major consumption phase is over in three key geographies-the US, Europe and India. Management has also cautioned for a tougher operating environment during Q4 FY17 in North America, Europe and India, Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd adds.This puts the growth burden on Latin America. Thankfully, the prospects in the region, especially Brazil, remain encouraging.Though the valuation at 16 times one-year-forward earnings estimates does not look expensive yet, two factors will play a crucial role in the continuing outperformance of the UPL stock.One is the maintenance of revenue growth momentum.

0.62,"Shares of Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) have performed well in recent months. One reason for the optimism is increasing crude oil prices. Brent crude prices have averaged higher so far for the current quarter compared to the September quarter. 
				   
				The state-run upstream oil company has announced a decent set of numbers for the quarter ended 30 September. Its operating profit or Ebitda came in at Rs9,539 crore. Analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd and Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd were expecting the measure at about Rs8,930 crore. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. One reason that helped ONGC beat estimates is a decline in operating costs. Statutory levies and other expenses declined 13% and 8%, respectively, on a year-on-year basis. Not only that, exploration costs written off fell sharply as well. Finance costs dropped 7.5%. The upshot: ONGCs pre-tax earnings increased 4% at a time when revenue declined 10% and other income was a bit lower.While the companys September quarter crude oil production is lower compared to last years quarter, crude oil and gas production both have improved compared to the June quarter. Net realization for the September quarter stood at $47.92 per barrel, an improvement on a sequential basis, which was pretty much expected. If the recent strength in oil prices were to persist, then upstream oil companies including ONGC will benefit this quarter. However, at the same time, some of the gains from higher oil prices are likely to be set off by the 18% lower domestic gas price effective 1 October.But investors have no reason to complain. The ONGC share price has increased by as much as 43% from its lows seen in mid-May. The board has recommended a bonus issue in the ratio of 1:2.

				That will change next year, when Apple Inc. plans to adopt the technology for the next major upgrade to its flagship product. To do so, the Cupertino, California-based company will have to get its hands on millions of OLED screens.As a result, Japanese suppliers are under pressure to build up manufacturing operations. Apple, which usually prefers to have multiple suppliers, is in negotiations with Sharp Corp. to procure OLEDs. Japan Display Inc. is moving to build up its own OLED production capabilities. Initial costs could reach $2 billion for each, stretching their finances even before they get any firm orders. Even so, they may not have a choice.If they dont invest in OLED, they will have to get out of the smartphone supplier business altogether, said Takeo Miyamoto, an analyst at MUFJ Morgan Stanley.JDI shares rose as much as 11% on Monday to their highest in almost three months. SMBC Nikko Securities raised its rating on the company to outperform from neutral.The smartphone industry is shifting away from liquid-crystal displays, or LCDs, which used to be on almost every phone and remains the standard for TVs. Now, the most expensive handsets usually feature OLEDs, thanks to their ability to use less battery power while delivering sharper and brighter images. Theyre also flexible, which opens up the possibility of bendable phones and other innovations in the sector.Samsung Electronics Co. currently dominates the market for smartphone OLEDs, making up 99% of shipments in the first half, according to IHS Markit. EverDisplay Optronics Ltd has just 0.4%. But Samsung isnt just the only supplier for the screens, its also Apples biggest competitor in the smartphone market, making it even more critical for Apple to secure new providers if it wants to use OLEDs for iPhones.Apple has lagged behind its rivals in embracing OLEDs. Samsungs Galaxy S7 and Googles new Pixel phones feature OLED screens, and dozens of models from Motorola, Oppo, HTC and other manufacturers also use the displays. A representative from Apple didnt respond to a request for comment on its OLED plans.Apple is said to be in talks with Samsung to secure OLED displays. Sharps capital investment in OLED is part of 200 billion yen that the manufacturer had already committed to OLED technology, part of a strategic plan it adopted with new owner Foxconn Technology Group, itself a key contract manufacturer for Apple. The opportunity is huge: IHS Markit estimates that the OLED-smartphone display market will be worth $18.6 billion in 2018, surpassing LCDs.Most suppliers are planning aggressive capital investment, said Hiroshi Hayase, an analyst at IHS Markit. Because OLEDs can be made of film-like flexible materials, theres a chance to open up new markets, he said.For Japan Display, which has lost 80% of its value since listing in 2014, winning the Apple contract is both its biggest opportunity and risk. JDI already depends on Apple for 54% of its revenue from LCD screens, according to Bloombergs Supply Chain Analysis. The display maker has approached banks to secure tens of billions of yen in financing, according to Kyodo News, and has little choice but to invest in OLED to remain in the game.JDI will have to invest 150 billion yen ($1.44 billion) to set up its OLED manufacturing line, either through borrowing or equity financing. JDI is planning to start an OLED fabrication line for testing by March 2018, according Kazuhiko Kubota, a spokesman for Tokyo-based JDI. He said the company is talking to customers, shareholders and banks about obtaining funding, but declined to discuss the companys planned investment in OLED or specific fundraising activities.One option for JDI would be to enter into a vendor financing agreement, using funds from Apple to build up operations and paying it back through sales of OLED screens. Its a risky strategy, and one that backfired for GT Advanced Technologies Inc. in 2014. Apple lined up $578 million in prepayment loans for GT Advanced so that it could feature tough sapphire screens for the iPhone 6. The manufacturer failed to deliver material of acceptable quality, and GT Advanced later sought bankruptcy protection.JDIs strategy has been to depend on Apple, Miyamoto said. Thats naïve.Formed four years ago from the struggling LCD operations of Sony Corp., Toshiba Corp. and Hitachi Ltd, JDI is 36 owned by Innovation Network Corp. of Japan, a government entity created in 2009 to support key technology businesses. Japan Display went public in 2014, and after posting a profit that year, has been losing money. While revenue has climbed each year, its now projected to decline 9% in the current fiscal year through June.The company is at risk of running short of funds, Miyamoto said. Its on a tightrope. Bloomberg",2016-10-17,Gjfr4wfuVEMAS1rWM4v5GJ,"Apple plans to adopt the OLED technology for the next major upgrade to its flagship product.

0.57,"Investors in Aditya Birla Nuvo Ltd had been hounding it with one questionwhen will the financial services business be demerged and listed as a separate entity? The company would typically dismiss this, saying some of these businesses were still small and needed the backing of a large firm such as Nuvo. 
				   
				The company has now decided to demerge the financial services business and list it. But instead of ending up with a leaner corporate structure, the Aditya Birla Group has made things far more complicated, by merging Nuvo with Grasim Industries Ltd. Besides, the complicated restructuring will increase the promoter groups stake in the cash cow cement business and decrease its ownership of the cash guzzling telecom business.Before the demerger, Nuvo will be merged into Grasim, which means investors of both companies will be saddled with a myriad of new businesses they earlier did not have any exposure to. The groups chairman, Kumar Mangalam Birla, said in a press conference that the merger, along with the demerger, will create value for shareholders. But on the contrary, with an increasing number of businesses ending up under one holding company, value could get destroyed. The only silver lining for existing shareholders is a holding in the to-be-listed financial services firm. The new behemoth that arises out of the merger will have so many diverse interests, most investors are likely to shun it. After all, each of the interesting parts of these businesses will be separately listedUltraTech Cement Ltd for the cement business, Idea Cellular Ltd for the telecom business and finally the newly listed financial services business. Investors may steer clear of a firm where a holding company discount is applied to so many large businesses.For perspective, Grasims 60.25% stake in UltraTech Cement itself is valued at less than 70% of its market value because of the holding company discount. Until now, for Grasim shareholders, there was at least an arbitrage opportunity, which would come into play when share prices fell vis-à-vis UltraTech Cements share price. In Nuvos case, some investors found the play on the financial services story compelling. There are hardly any reasons to invest in the merged company, certainly not after the financial services firm lists. Interestingly enough, the promoter holding in Grasim will rise from 31.3% to around 38.8% post the restructuring. Their ownership in the financial services and telecom businesses will decline. Minority shareholders of Grasim, on the other hand, have to settle for a lower stake in the cement business and take on exposure to the telecom and financial services business. Since the promoter group is considered the most informed investor, a natural question these investors will have is, Why should we do the opposite of what the promoters are doing? Nuvos shareholders, a far smaller piece in the whole puzzle in terms of their value of shareholding, get to enjoy the same ride as the promoters. But again, they too end up with an investment in a holding company. All told, it is not clear that the merger will add value, and minority investors may well protest.",2016-08-11,GqVgitnAuvR4RQQirAUeGO,"Instead of ending up with a leaner corporate structure, the Aditya Birla Group has made things far more complicated, by merging Nuvo with Grasim Industries

The ride-sharing industry has presented Chinas government with a host of challengesincluding serious political and social strifeand the plight of consumers hurt by reduced competition simply isnt high on its list of concerns. In Chinas biggest cities, choked by traffic and taxi monopolies, the arrival of ride-sharing has been transformative. Take Beijing: Between 1994 and 2011, the citys population increased from 11 million to 20 million, yet licensed taxis increased by only 10%, to 66,000. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Beijings cab drivers have acquired a reputation as some of the worst in the world. Taxi-hailing and ride-sharing apps offered a cheap and clever solution to this problem, and quality of life improved as a result.But that improvement came at a cost. Recorded taxi strikes in China surged from 62 in 2011 to 263 in 2015. In Shenzhen, where licenced cabbies claim that ride-sharing has cut their monthly pay in half, a strike in January effectively immobilized the city. Thousands of drivers in at least a dozen other cities walked out the same month. Making matters worse, the labour strife is compounded by class divisions: Most ride-sharing drivers own their cars, while taxi drivers must rent theirs.All this has placed the authorities in a delicate position. As in other countries, taxi companies in China are usually protected monopolies, and often owned by a local government or local officials. In most cases, they make money by charging rental fees to drivers. Didi and Uber were undercutting this comfortable arrangement by subsidizing faresthus luring both drivers and customersin a fierce war for market share.Some local governments cracked down on the newcomers, occasionally sparking riots. Others threw their support behind apps that hired drivers licenced by the old monopolies. But for the central government, the preferred approach was simpler: Eliminate competition. Doing so would limit the subsidy wars, mollify angry taxi drivers andcriticallyincrease the governments leverage over the remaining player(s).Also Read: Ubers surrender to Didi Chuxing shows humbling of US tech giants in China

Last year, regulators allowed Didi to merge with its largest domestic rival, Kuaidi, despite concerns about how the deal would affect consumers. Last week, they issued rules that effectively outlawed competition by prohibiting ride-sharing companies from setting prices below cost to push out competitors or dominate the market. That means local governments can now negotiate pricing and other concerns with Didi without having to worry about anyone undercutting the deal.Thats clearly a win for Didi. Its probably a win for Uber, whose investors will retain a 20% stake in its former rival. And (for now) it seems like a win for Beijing, which badly wants the benefits of ride-sharing without the disruptions that go along with it. The only losers will be consumers, who will likely be facing higher fares, less choice and worse service. Chinas passengers, in other words, are once again being taken for a ride.

Ltd (ONGC), said a person aware of the development. 
				   
				The move is set to secure more time for RIL to resolve the dispute and help it avoid any immediate financial impact. The ministry raised the demand on 4 November, giving RIL one month to pay up, after the justice A.P. Shah panel told the ministry on 31 August that RIL should make up for the unfair enrichment it had obtained by way of retaining the gains of gas that seeped into its field from that of ONGC. The one-member panel, which looked into ONGCs complaints of gas flow between the two companies blocks, had also said that it is the government, not the state-run firm, which is eligible for compensation from RIL.The Mukesh Ambani-promoted firm has questioned the way the government interpreted the production lease for its KG-DWN-98/3 (KG D6) block and alleged that the manner of claiming compensation neither conformed to law nor to global practices, the person cited earlier said, on condition of anonymity. RIL, as the operator of the KG D6 block, has sought arbitration on behalf of the consortium comprising Canadas Niko Resources Ltd and BP Exploration (Alpha) Ltd, the person said. Emails sent to the three companies remained unanswered at the time of going to press. A government official privy to the developments, however, said there was no way of resolving the dispute other than RIL paying for the gas that did not belong to its field. With both sides hardening their positions, the dispute is set to slip into a protracted legal battle. According to a report by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, a US-based consultancy selected by both ONGC and RIL which was relied upon by the Shah panel for confirmation of the gas flow between the blocks, about 11 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas migrated to KG D6 from adjacent fields between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2015,  of which 8.9 bcm was tapped by RIL. The government official cited above said the ministry has not applied any discretion in arriving at the compensation figure.The government merely multiplied the amount of gas found by independent consultants to have flowed between the fields with the applicable gas price, the official said. Prolonged disputes are not in the interest of the industrys development.

0.17,"Over a decade ago, one of the doyens of Indian business journalism had written an article, Tale of two companies, comparing two packaged consumer goods makersHindustan Lever Ltd (still not Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) then) and ITC Ltd. Since then much soap and detergent have been washed down the Hooghly and Arabian Seaas indeed millions of puffs have been blown through human chimneys. While HUL has regained its old act by re-engineering itself, ITC has got its new act together by reinventing itself. 
				   
				Till the early 1990s, the punch line of all Hindustan Lever chairmen used to be we are an Indian company whose largest shareholder happens to be a multinational. ITC, on the other hand, used to be less apologetic about its BAT Plc. parentage. Following the eminently forgettable K.L. Chugh era, when Y.C. Deveshwar mounted the saddle, in a corporate coup of sorts with the backing of institutional shareholders, he decisively cut off the umbilical chord and embarked on a mission to establish ITCs Indian credentials with a vengeance. At the same time, with liberalization of the Indian economy, the new generation chairmen of Lever over time shed their trademark khadi silk bush-shirts in favour of bespoke suits when traversing the power corridors of Delhi. However, this piece is not about comparing the two companies but trace the evolution of ITC as an Indian consumer products giant. It is easy to surmise why Ajit Haksarthe last of the corporate Mohicansventured into hotels. It was partly to hedge against the possibility of curbs on the tobacco business and also as a safe haven for the surplus funds of the mother business that could be easily encashed anytime by selling the brand or the real estate. It is to Haksar and ITCs credit that they nurtured Welcomgroup for a long time before it became truly profitable. Printing and packaging (where Deveshwar first cut his teeth) and paper boards were but logical vertical integration.Similarly, one would believe the lifestyle and apparel business was started to secure the Wills franchise. But the real serious diversification was kicked off with ITCs plunge into the foods businesswhich arose both out of necessity and opportunity. Subsequently, it naturally extended to pure consumer products play.The story of ITCs transformation is one of turning a proverbial threat into an opportunity. As the time-worn cliché goescigarettes is a dying industry in more senses than one. With the intervention of World Health Organization and a judiciary increasingly sensitive to the hazards of tobacco consumption, the tobacco industry has had to brace itself for a premature sunset like its consumers (smokers). Simultaneously, there was a need to divert public attention from corporate governance and health (tobacco) to being a socially-responsible organization. This, one would suspect, was the genesis of a we also make cigarettes strategy.The ban on cigarette advertising came as a blessing in disguise as it left ITC flush with cash. Not having a majority foreign shareholding allowed it to enter the food sectorthen reserved for domestic players (except those such as Nestle SA, GlaxoSmithKline PLC and a few otherswho enjoyed the benefits of a grandfather clause). Food was largely an open field with no organized pan-India player barring Britannia Industries Ltd. From biscuits, atta, ready-to-cook or heat meals, it has seamlessly moved to instant noodles, juices and now, one hears, coffee is in the pipeline.For a cigarette manufacturer with low technology and little product innovation except in packaging perhaps, ITCs most remarkable achievement was in learning the ropes of an entirely different supply chain and gaining mastery of a new product category, not just in terms of marketing but product development and innovation. Equally challenging was building a network whichcontrary to popular beliefhad little in common with the cigarette retail channel.The evolution into personal care was even more interesting because here it had to contend with a giant like Unilever with an 80-year legacy in India, international brands and world-class research and development. Making soaps, body-wash and shampoo brands is as different as paneer is from talcum powder. Globally, too, it is rare for companies to be equally successful in both food and packaged consumer products. Neither Unilever nor Procter & Gamble Co. can really be considered to have handled both businesses with the same level of success while traditional food makers like Nestle and General Foods Corp. have by and large stuck to their knitting.However, ITCs real success lies in achieving this transformation with existing, home-grown talent with very little (or practically no) lateral hires at senior levels. ITC remains one of the few large companies that still believes in providing long-term careers to its employees. It is a key differentiator in a fast-changing corporate world where turnover and velocity are the current flavours of human resources management. Changing the corporate DNA and culture is no mean task. If an organization has to reinvent itself so have to its leaders. This is where Deveshwar scores above many of our present day corporate icons. Arguably, he had an extended stay at the top. But Deveshwar leaves behind a new ITC for the next generation.In contrast, the much-hyped Project Millennium of Leverriding on which many careers were madelost steam. Among close to a dozen business ideas incubatedjust about one (water, that too in a modified form) has survived the genetic implant.It was generous of Deveshwar to praise Amul and Patanjali in his speech. The jury on the latter is still out. But, what it does underscore is the rapidly shrinking ramp-up time. What took Unilever 60 years to achieve, Amul did in 40 and ITC in 20. Now, Patanjali has managed to scale up in less than five.

0.25,"Frankfurt: For any management-minded British engineer, theres no bigger job than becoming chief executive of Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc. Warren East, a well-regarded technology enthusiast, may end up crushed by the size of the task.
				   
				East, 55, spent more than a decade transforming UK chip designer ARM Holdings into a world-beater. ARM was bought this year by Japans SoftBank for a staggering £24 billion ($29.4 billion), suggesting he did a good job.Few would have begrudged him spending the rest of his professional life holding cushy non-executive roles, giving speeches and playing his beloved church organ on weekends. But at Rolls-Royce hes opted for arguably the toughest job in British industry. After a difficult first 18 months, theres little relief in sight in 2017 for the jet engine and turbine maker.True, a rebound in oil prices may help Rolls-Royces struggling marine division. Even so, the group probably wont generate much cash flow next year, after an expected outflow of as much as £300 million in 2016.While analysts anticipate net income will rise to more than £600 million in 2017, that overstates Rolls-Royces health because of its odd accountingof which more anon.To his credit, Easts lost no time slashing costs and cutting jobs and has scored some successes: increasing financial disclosure, speeding up aircraft engine production and dispensing with Rolls-Royces imperious management culture. But the long development cycles in aerospace mean East isnt entirely the master of his destiny. The Rolls-Royce course was set long before he arrived.The companys £70.5 billion civil order book is focused on the wide-body jet market, where Rolls-Royce is aiming for a 50% share. Yet thats a questionable ambition in itself because single-aisle jets are able to fly much further these days and theyve sold much better than their fatter brethren.More important, theres no guarantee that Rolls-Royces orders, which mostly pre-date East, will ultimately generate lots of cash and profits. One reason for the recent profit woes is that older jets were grounded sooner than managers calculated, meaning Rolls-Royce didnt get the expected service revenues. In view of the huge cost of delivering (and then maintaining) such a large order book its reasonable to ask whether theres anything else previous management got wrong.There are other grounds for caution. Last month, East shocked investors when he revealed Rolls-Royces core civil aerospace unit is loss-making under the more orthodox revenue recognition practices it will have to adopt from 2018.Deutsche Bank analyst Ben Fidler thinks the civil engine division, which contributes about half of Rolls-Royce revenue, wont make an operating profit until 2019 under the new accounting rules. That will be four years after East first took over.Furthermore, when the company stops capitalizing engine losses on its balance sheet in 2018, as its done up until now, shareholder equity could be almost wiped out, according to Credit Suisse. Despite those chastening views, Rolls-Royce still trades on 25 times estimated earnings, a hefty premium to French rival Safran SAand thats before you adjust for Rolls-Royces accounting peculiarities.Such a rich valuation shows investors faith that East knows what hes doing. But that confidence could evaporate quickly if he cant provide tangible proof that Rolls-Royces order book is creating value.A crucial test will come in 2018, when the company has implied it will target about £500 million of free cash flow. Thats going to be tough. East said last month that Rolls-Royce loses up to £2 million on each new engine produced. He may come to regret not spending more time trying to perfect his organ pedal technique.

				A significant portion of the credit for making space cool again goes to the disruption of the space industry over the last few years by private enterprise. The poster boy of this bright new space is, of course, Elon Musk and SpaceX. From slashing the cost of launches by landing the first stages of rockets through putting together plans to colonize Mars, he has already shown he has what it takes to define space for tomorrow. Over the years, national space agencies like Nasa, Isro, Roscosmos, CNSA, Jaxa and ESA have been at the forefront of pushing humanity into space. That is changing.There are parallels to where space is now and where the Internet was a few decades back. For many years, the Internet remained a project inside the US government establishment. I dont need to expand on how the opening up of the Internet to entrepreneurs changed the world. Space is at a similar juncture where private enterprise is starting to make its presence felt. The next decade is when much of this shift will be under way. The attraction of space tourism has been central to the coverage and narrative that has followed private enterprise in the field. That is only natural, given the presence of media-friendly figures like Virgin Groups Richard Branson working on space tourism projects. But the real innovation driven by private enterprise is going to be in other, less glamorous but equally fascinating areas. Think small satellites, for instance. As The Economist points out, advancements in smartphones and other consumer electronics provide a wealth of ready-made technologies that can enable a CubeSat (a type of nano satellite) to perform many of the functions of a satellite a hundred times heavier and much larger, but at substantially less cost. That will revolutionize everything from weather prediction to remote sensing to telecommunications, and help bring the power of technology to billions around the world in a much deeper and more meaningful way.Then there is the opportunity to develop technology that will satiate human appetite for everything from energy to precious metals. Globally, companies like Deep Space Industries have been talking up asteroid mining. An article in the technology publication New Atlas says, Studies indicate that an asteroid 1,000 metres (3,280 ft) across could yield about 100,000 tonnes of platinumwhich already has miners in South Africa worried because we only mine a measly 130 tonnes of the metal on Earth each year.Helium 3 is another resource which can change how mankind powers itself. The Moon has rich deposits of the isotope, which is hard to find on Earth. If technology is developed to use this isotope for nuclear fusion, the amount of Helium 3 on the Moonaccording to Prof. Ouyang Ziyuan, the chief scientist of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program (Clep)can solve humanitys energy demand for around 10,000 years at least. If finding ways to make that happen isnt a challenge that entrepreneurs must rise up to, what is?While the idea of space-based business evolves, India is in the middle of a revolution as well. A new generation of entrepreneurs is backing itself to change the way we live and do business. Our opportunity in space business does not start and end with cost arbitrage for foreign companies. Our obvious cost advantages must be leveraged as a catalyst to innovate in everything from designing, developing and launching smaller satellites to making bets that can make the difference in mankinds quest for newer energy sources.

He rates the Narendra Modi government an 8 on 10 on reforms delivery. Edited excerpts:
How do you perceive the governments demonetization move?It is a dramatic and remarkable move. Normally, such a measure will happen in a country in the middle of a macroeconomic crisis and facing a hyperinflationary problem. But India is not facing such a crisis.Do you think this is the first in a series of moves to tackle the larger problem of black money?I would like to see this as part and parcel of the move to accelerate digital banking. That is the key structural thing. You had the drive to get everybody a bank account. The UIDAI programme has also has been continued. There is also the political angle of state elections next year.What are the negative implications?I think it is going to impact the economy in the next six months. But I am hoping it is short and sharp. The biggest negative is for the real estate market. It is negative for equities in the short term and positive for bonds.The question is how long will the pain remain (for equity markets)six months or one year? I am hoping its six months, but thats just an initial estimate. It all depends on how quickly they get the new money in place. If the new money comes in soon, things will not be so bad. If it goes beyond six months, the markets will be vulnerable.The real estate sector was already doing badly, thats hit, but then it was already lying on the ground. Autos, cement and housing finance were doing well, and are now going to be hit.On the positive side, tax revenues will rise and this will help in reining in the fiscal deficit. The other benefit will be to the bond market and currency. The currency has been very stable and this will be a positive for it.How do you think the governments move will impact the chances of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in the state elections next year?It is a very bold move by the government because it could backfire. It is very risky. (With) any such move, you cannot be 100% sure if the practical implementation will work. How long it will take to deal with the inevitable teething issues.The Modi government will complete two-and-a-half years later this month. How do you assess its time in office?There have been dramatic reforms, but the big missing link has been that we have not had the big capitalization of state-run banks. It is still a work in progress.There has been a lot of pressure on banks to own up to the bad loans and there has been a lot of red ink reported. So, that is progress. I have been hoping that you will see consolidation of public sector banks. The setting up of the banking bureau is also a positive. But because the big recapitalization is missing, it is delaying economic recovery.But otherwise, demonetization is one of the biggest reforms. GST (goods and services tax) is in the works, bankruptcy is also a positive in the long term, but it will take many years. The law for regulating the property market is important.How will you rate the government on reforms?I will give the government an 8 out of 10.Is India still an attractive investment destination?India is still a very attractive destination on a long-term basis. It is not the best market in the next three months. The key thing to watch out will be how deep and how long the economic fallout from this attack on cash will last.Will this move impact corporate earnings as well?The market was expecting corporate earnings to pick up, but that is being delayed now. I am hoping that it is not more than six months. If it does not resolve within that time, then the market is very vulnerable.What do you make of Donald Trumps victory?It does not mean anything for India, as it is more dependent on the domestic story. The impact on the other emerging markets so far is that the US bond market is sold off, and that has led to pressure on emerging market debt, which is selling off. People made a lot of money in emerging market bonds this year, and are now rushing to sell. However, the Indian debt market is not the worst-hit. Indian equities, right now, are completely driven by the domestic development of demonetization.Investment demand has not picked up in India. When do you think that will pick up?In terms of investment cycle, there are three areas that can get it up. The first is government-driven infrastructure, which is happening; capital expenditure, which is still low; and the third one is real estate, which has taken a hit. So, the investment cycle is not going to recover anytime soon.A lot of IPOs with unique propositions hit the market this year. What are your thoughts on the same?The more important asset class that is emerging in India is stressed debt. To me, that is more interesting than the IPOs. Thats a sign that the banking system is beginning to get cleaned up.We had a change of guard at the Reserve Bank of India.

But that would require developers to raise equity funding first.Clean Max Enviro Energy Solutions Pvt. Ltd, the largest rooftop solar projects developer by market share, is looking to raise its first equity funding early next year, managing director Kuldeep Jain said without disclosing details.Amplus Energy Solutions Pvt. Ltd, which is backed by private equity firm I Squared Capital and counts Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Yamaha Corp. and hotel chain Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. as its customers, is looking to tie up loans worth Rs200 crore from the World Bank to fund its rooftop projects, said  chief executive Sanjeev Aggarwal.I Squared last year invested $150 million in the company for an equity stake. As it executes more projects, Amplus could also do with more equity infusion from I Squared, Aggarwal said. Amplus is the countrys second-largest rooftop solar projects developer.The World Bank had in June said it would invest $625 million in Indias rooftop solar sector, while the ADB said this month that it plans to provide $500 million in financing to the sector.Executives of both the financial institutions said they were preparing to begin these investments. The World Bank project is being implemented by the State Bank of India, which will lend funds to developers of commercial and industrial rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems. ADBs financing will be through Punjab National Bank.The project will finance the installation of at least 400  megawatt (MW) of grid-connected rooftop solar photovoltaic across India, Simon Stolp, lead energy specialist, World Bank, India, said in an email. The project will support a number of solar PV business models, to expand the reach of rooftop PV systems to a variety of customer groups, he added.India needs as much as $200 billion to meet its target of installing 100GW of solar power and 60GW of wind power by 2022. Of the planned solar capacity, 40GW has to come from rooftop projects.The countrys rooftop solar market has added capacity at the fastest pace this year and crossed 1GW in total installed capacity, according to Bridge To India, a renewable energy-focused consultancy and research firm.Bridge to India expects the sector to reach a total capacity of 12.7GW by 2021 (bit.ly/2enTmkx).The rooftop solar market in India has grown at a compound annual growth rate of about 90% in the past two years, while the cost of installing rooftop solar has fallen by 12% per annum for the past four years.Whenever an industry grows at that kind of a scorching pace, there is space as well as need for multiple players, Clean Maxs Jain said. By nature, it ends up being a fragmented, long-tail market. It is a low-entry barrier business and hence there is a lot of excitement to enter it.Sunvest Energy Pvt. Ltd, which is focused on the residential and small scale rooftop market, is also hoping to raise equity, according to founder and chief executive Sishir Garemella, a former Barclays Capital and L&T Infrastructure Insurance Co Ltd executive. Including pipeline, we are at 20 projects right now and our 18 months goal is to get this number up to 120, Garemella said, adding that he would look to tie up loans from World Bank, ADB or other investors for these projects.  Mynergy Renewables Pvt. Ltd, which is executing projects for a public sector bank, is also looking for early stage funding, chief executive Bhaskar Deol said.The new loans are a part of the efforts of the ministry of new and renewable energy to line up low-cost financing for the rooftop sector from German bank KfW, World Bank and ADB.Last year, KfW said it would issue low-interest loans of about 1 billion over the next five years for Indias rooftop solar projects, construction of solar energy farms and for self-contained solar power facilities.",2016-10-27,I0cRyndBqS5fInXGEbWkVO,"Over $2.2 billion of loans are likely to be available for the rooftop sector starting this year, but that requires developers to raise equity funding first",01:43,Rooftop solar firms look to raise equity investment

-0.56,"Indias exporters and importers have for long grappled with the extra charges levied by container shipping lines and their agents in different ways.
				   
				So, it came as a surprise when Indias maritime administration, the Directorate General of Shipping (DGS), issued a circular last week that carriers and their agents have finally agreed not to collect some 25 different charges primarily concerned with imports.Pressure was building up on Indias shipping ministry after a Rajya Sabha panel questioned the government over the lack of transparency and reasonableness in the various charges levied by the shipping lines and their agents in export-import (EXIM) trade.The Prime Ministers Office (PMO) waded into the issue and asked the finance ministry to look into it. The finance ministry, in turn, asked the shipping ministry to find a solution.The shipping ministry then formed a committee led by a deputy DGS and comprising representatives from stake-holders in the maritime sector to identify and examine the grievances of the trade and submit its recommendations. The panel discussed some 58 extra charges levied by shipping lines/agents on import shipments alone, of which there was consensus not to levy 25 different extra charges including the winter season charges, terminal handling charges (THC) and inland haulage charges (IHC); the rest were either not accepted or were yet to be discussed.The committee is yet to examine the extra charges on the export side.The eventual outcome of the committee recommendations is that any charge that is not shown in the bill of lading cannot be charged or recovered.A bill of lading is a document issued by a carrier or his agent to acknowledge receipt of a shipment of cargo. But the question that is uppermost in the minds of exporters and importers is whether the consensus among the stakeholders and the recommendations of the committee are binding without legal backing.Still, what gives hope is the support of the Container Shipping Lines Association (CSLA), a key constituent, to the committees recommendations. CSLA is a lobby representing container shipping lines operating in India.On 7 September, DGS issued a circular acknowledging the consensus that led to the unanimous recommendations and reiterating an advice to the carriers/agents not to collect these 25 different extra charges involved in the transportation of EXIM goods as a good/best practice.Two of the 25 charges mentioned in the DGS advisoryTHC and IHCcannot be scrapped because it is a part and parcel of the container trade globally, says shipping executives.THC is a charge levied by the port and terminals from the shipping lines, which, in turn, recover it from their customers.While the THC levied by the government-owned ports on the shipping lines are a notified tariff item regulated by the Tariff Authority for Major Ports, or TAMP, THC recovered by the shipping lines from the customers is not regulated by any agency. TAMP does not have powers to regulate THC collected by the shipping lines from their customers. THC is supposed to be a reimbursement of the actual amount paid by the shipping lines to the ports and terminals. But in actual practice, that is not the case, according to shippers (cargo owners).Shippers say THC is a substantial amount and sometimes exceeds 70-80% of the ocean freight. There is a big difference between what they are paying to the ports and what they are recovering from customers as THC.Besides, exporters claim that the shipping lines are resorting to a so-called double-dipping by using THC to pass on the trade risk to the shippers.Typically, the money paid by the shipping lines to the ports is a part of their operating costs and is factored in the freight rates.Ocean freight includes the cost of loading cargo containers onto ships and unloading containers from ships. Despite this, the expenses incurred for loading and unloading containers are recovered from shippers separately as THC, leading to double-dipping by the lines.Exporters argue that the exorbitant THC charged by the lines contributes to high transaction costs, making Indias exports uncompetitive in the global market. THC is increased arbitrarily, often without consulting the exporters. The shipping lines have been hiking THC without disclosing the actual expenses incurred by them for the amount recovered. Overseas customers dont pay these charges as they are incurred within the country of export. Shippers have consistently favoured an all-inclusive cost without any of the extra charges and have sought government intervention to prohibit lines from collecting THC in India. Container shipping lines are against regulating THC and have refuted charges by shippers that they were over-charging customers by recovering a higher THC than what they were paying to the port and terminals.IHC is the cost involved in carting the cargo container from the ports to customers inland by road or rail. Both THC and IHC are globally accepted pricing practices. It has to be charged. Obviously, these cannot be scrapped. But if the DGS wanted this to be reflected in the bill of lading, thats a different issue, says shipping industry veteran Sabyasachi Hajara, a former chairman and managing director of state-owned Shipping Corp. of India Ltd. The problem of extra charges has more to do with agents and freight forwarders than with the carriers, according to experts. For container lines having local agents, the agents levy the extra charges which dont even go to the lines; they go to the agents kitty.  What the shipping ministry can insist on, according to Hajara, is that any charge that is proposed to be levied by the lines has to be registered with some agency such as the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) in the US. It has to be transparent and be available for anyone to see. In the US, nobody can complain because shipping service providers have to file their rates with the FMC, which has to include every charge and that is available for the exporters and importers to see.P.

0.24,"Nestlé India Ltd, the local unit of the worlds largest food company, is evaluating five new segments that it may enter  over the next few quarters. 
				   
				The move is part of the companys plan to reduce its dependence on Maggi noodles and get its existing portfolio of products back on the growth path, Suresh Narayanan, chairman and managing director, Nestlé India, said on Tuesday.We are evaluating five categoriesNespresso (a coffee machine), Dolce Gusto (a coffee capsule system), pet care, cereal and skin care. We have recently entered the healthcare segment. However, we are yet to finalize which ones to start with, Narayanan said, adding that, globally, Nestlé has around 20,000 brands, while the company sells just about 20 in India. Nestlé, which entered India in 1912, turned into a demolished house, as Narayanan put it, after its single largest revenue earner, Maggi, faced a ban in June 2015. Nestlé could not sell Maggi, which accounted for 30% of the firms revenue in 2014, for six months after the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) ordered the company to withdraw the instant noodles.The FSSAI order, which was overturned by the Bombay high court in August 2015, was based on allegations that Maggi noodles contained monosodium glutamate, and lead in excess of prescribed limits.There were ripple effects across portfolios. We took a hit in milk and nutrition, coffee and beverages, chocolates, et al. What we are trying to do is to catch back on not just Maggi but the collateral damages that took place in the rest of the portfolio. Thats why we still see little bit of trailing effect. Its like reconstructing a demolished house, not reconstructing a house where one door and one window have been broken, said Narayanan, who was sent to India immediately after FSSAI declared the ban to tackle the crisis.Narayanan got Maggi back to retail shelves on 9 November 2015. It is exactly one year. Maggi has come back to the market leader position with more than 58% share. It was clinically dead in September 2015. But we are yet to reach the level before the crisis. On the other hand, the category has also shrunk. Besides rebuilding Maggi, we need to rebuild the category, said Narayanan, adding, the name Nestlé was dented due to the unfortunate Maggi issue.In calendar year 2014, Nestlé India had revenue of Rs9,854.84 crore. The companys total revenue is still much below what it was before the ban. In the quarter ended 30 September, it reported revenue of Rs2,190.2 crore. It was Rs2,332.6 crore in quarter ended 31 March 2015 (the quarter before the Maggi ban).Things are changing. Backed by new launches (25-30 products in the past few months) coupled with renewed focus in larger cities, chocolates and confectionery have already come back to growth. Coffee and beverages are turning back to growth. But milk and nutrition are still under pressure. We are taking measures to get these back to growth. The desire is to get back to double-digit growth as soon possible, Narayanan said.The company has already started bringing out new milk products. There is pricing pressure in milk. We are not into the discounting game. Rather, well bring more differentiated and innovative products, (shift of focus from dry milk to liquid). We have to make certain trade-offs between value, volume and profitability, he added.According to Narayanan, the boards of Nestlé India and Nestlé SA, have agreed that there was a need to accelerate the game in India, which will require fresh investments in the existing portfolio, new products, renovation and innovation, with a quest to double revenue in India within four to five years.Analysts had last year indicated that Nestlé may bring in new products from its global portfolio as the company had been looking to reduce dependence on Maggi noodles. Nestlé India could look at bringing in products in pet care, water and ice-cream, Abneesh Roy, an analyst with Edelweiss Securities, had said in a note in August 2015.",2016-11-09,IAzc5Enoyu833qzId3BoYJ,Nestlé India may enter five new segments as part of a long-term plan to reduce dependence on Maggi,01:55,Nestlé India looks to enter new categories

				The first, for the December 2015 quarter, came as a rude awakening, with shares correcting 25% in two trading sessions after the results announcement. After the June quarter results were announced, its shares fell 11% in two trading sessions.Thankfully for investors, the September quarter results werent way off the mark vis-a-vis the Streets expectations.IndiGo reported an operating profit of Rs195.6 crore, 2% lower than what analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities had estimated.But there isnt much to get excited about in the results either.For one, pricing pressures have continued. Although this was expected, given the increased competitive pressure, the 11% year-on-year decline in yield is more than what some analysts estimated. For instance, Kotak Institutional Equities and Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd had expected yields to decline 8% and 8.7%, respectively.At the time of announcing the June quarter results, IndiGo had said it will re-think matching fares more aggressively with competitors. The silver lining in this story is that while pricing pressures have persisted, robust load factors have compensated to some extent. IndiGos load factor during the past quarter was 82.2%, compared with 78.4% for the same period last year.But that wasnt enough to cap the decline in revenue per available seat km (RASK), which declined to Rs3.12 from Rs3.36 during the same time frame. RASK is total revenue net of finance income per available seat km.A slower rate of increase in other expenses and employee costs facilitated 11% Ebitdar growth to Rs967.7 crore. Thats despite the fact that fuel costs as a percentage of revenues increased 217 basis points to 37% last quarter. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Ebitdar is earnings before finance income and cost, taxes, depreciation, amortization and aircraft and engine rentals. Ebitdar margin declined to 23.2%, compared with 24.6% in the same period last year.After the seasonally lean September quarter, it will be interesting to watch how the stronger December quarter shapes up. Load factors may continue to remain healthy but analysts dont foresee much respite on pricing pressure. The company said in a post earnings conference call that the competition levels remain high.Industry passenger growth is encouraging, with passengers carried by domestic airlines in January-September 2016 increasing 23%.

				IndiGo, Indias biggest airline, will operate fewer of the A320neo jets in the current financial year than previously estimated, while AerCap Holdings NV, which has more than 220 on order, said it expects the delays to continue into 2017. US-based Air Lease Corp. said last week its discussing financial remedies with the European planemaker with as many as eight deliveries now expected to be delayed next year.Output of the A320neo is being disrupted by manufacturing delays at Pratt and Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp. that builds the planes geared turbofan engine. Pratt in September cut this years delivery target to 150 engines from 200, saying it couldnt produce certain parts fast enough.Theres a lot of uncertainty around the exact timetable for deliveries at the moment particularly those that are powered by the geared turbofan, AerCap chief executive officer (CEO) Aengus Kelly said in a telephone interview. He said he expects more clarity before the end of the year.AerCap, the worlds largest independent lessor, has received only two of the 16 A320neos slated for the fourth quarter and said it doesnt know how many of deliveries would slide into 2017.We are working closely with our customer to resolve the issue and minimize any impact to their operations, Pratt said in an emailed statement. The company has said that the engine is achieving 99.9% dispatch reliability while meeting promised performance on fuel burn and emissions reduction.The A320neo is also powered by engines made by CFM International, a venture between General Electric Co. and Safran SA. CFM hasnt seen delays. Some customers for the narrow-bodies are placing orders without choosing between Pratts turbine or its rival built by CFM International, AerCaps Kelly said.AirAsia Bhd., Airbuss top customer, received its first A320neos with the CFM engines in September. The Malaysian budget carrier is in talks with Airbus to bring forward deliveries for 2017, AirAsia Group CEO Tony Fernandes has said.IndiGo is now expecting to fly 20 A320neos at the end of March, compared with an earlier target of 24, president Aditya Ghosh said on a conference call on Tuesday. To offset the impact, the carrier operated by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd will deploy used aircraft on short-term leases, Ghosh said.The Indian carrier, Airbuss biggest customer for the A320neo jets with 430 on order, took its first aircraft in March. The company, which has a contract with Pratt to provide power systems for the first 150 planes, is closely watching the performance of CFMs competing powerplants, Ghosh said.John Plueger, CEO of Air Lease, said on 3 November that the geared turbofan engine has so far performed well in service. He said Airbus told Air Lease that some or all of its eight Pratt-powered A320neo and A321neos scheduled for 2017 may be delayed.Airbus has had to allocate those engines as a scarce resource. Who those engines go to is a matter of debate and argument, Plueger said. Every airline and every lessor is saying, We want ours first.InterGlobe, which reported second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, said engine issues hurt IndiGos on-time performance and cancellation rates during the three months through September. The company posted a 24% jump in after-tax profit to Rs1.4 billion for the period, missing the Rs1.8 billion expected by analysts, according to an average of six estimates compiled by Bloomberg.The roll-out of the A320neo, which first went into service with Deutsche Lufthansa AG in January, has been marred by several engine issues.

-0.38,"The nervousness in the ICICI Bank Ltd stock was apparent on Friday when it fell 3.5% before the announcement of the banks June quarter financials after the market closed.
				   
				Although the 25% fall in ICICI Banks net profit from a year ago isnt exactly a surprise, the fact is the fall was cushioned to some extent by a rise in non-interest income and lower tax outgo.Treasury gains were a big contributor to the increase in non-interest income.But what the Street really cares about is news whether the banks asset quality woes are ebbing. On the face of it, ICICI Banks gross non-performing assets (NPAs) have increased by a mere 5 basis points sequentially. Gross NPAs have risen from 4.72% of customer assets in December 2015 to 5.82% in March 2016 and are now at 5.87%.But one big reason for mitigating the rise in gross NPAs is that assets worth Rs.2,332 crore were sold to asset reconstruction companies (ARCs). Had that not been the case, the number would have been higher. The net NPA ratio has gone up much more, from 2.98% in March to 3.35%. Thats because provisioning came down a bit and the provisioning coverage ratio slipped from 61% at end-March to 57.1% by end-June.Another dampener was slippages. The March 2016 quarter saw total slippages at Rs.7,003 crore, which rose to Rs.8,249 crore in the June quarter. This number does not include the assets sold to ARCs. According to some analysts, the rate of slippages is worrisome and could lead to nasty surprises in future.The rise in bad loans took its toll on income growth, as widely expected, with net interest income (NII) rising a mere 0.9% year-on-year (y-o-y).

Ltd (ONGC). 
				   
				Calgary-based Niko Resources Ltd, which holds 10% interest in RIL-operated KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block, said the partners believe they are not liable for the amount claimed by the government of India. In an emailed statement, it said it is considering joining RIL in invoking the dispute resolution mechanism in the production sharing contract (PSC). The oil ministry had on 3 November issued a notice to RIL, Niko and UKs BP plc seeking $1.47 billion for producing in the seven years ended 31 March 2016 about 338.332 million British thermal units of gas that had seeped or migrated from state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp.s (ONGC) blocks into adjoining KG-D6 in Bay of Bengal. After deducting $71.71 million royalty paid on the gas produced and adding an interest at the rate of Libor plus 2%, totalling $149.86 million, a total demand of $1.55 billion was made on RIL, BP and Niko. RIL had on Friday stated that it proposes to invoke the dispute resolution mechanism in the PSC and issue a notice of arbitration to the government. RIL remains convinced of being able to fully justify and vindicate its position that the governments claim is not sustainable, the company had said, adding it has worked within the boundaries of the KG-D6 block awarded to it and has complied with all applicable regulations and provisions of the PSC. The claim of the government is based on misreading and misinterpretation of key elements of the PSC and is without precedent in the oil and gas industry, anywhere in the world, it had said. BP, which holds the remaining 30% interest, said it is evaluating its options. BP believes that the action taken is neither in line with well-established global practices nor is it in line with the PSC. We are aligned and working with our partners to evaluate our options to achieve an effective resolution, a BP India spokesperson said. Originally, ONGC had sued RIL for producing gas that had migrated from its blocks KG-DWN-98/2 (KG-D5) and Godavari PML in the KG basin to adjoining KG-D6 block of RIL. Under direction of the Delhi High Court, the government had appointed a one-man committee under retired justice A P Shah to go into the issue. The panel in its report on 29 August felt that the government and not ONGC is entitled to compensation.Subsequently, the ministry asked its upstream technical arm DGH to calculate the amount of compensation and a demand notice was slapped on RIL-BP-Niko. The committee has concluded that the contractors (RIL- BP-Niko) production of migrated gas and retention of ensuing benefits amounts to unjust enrichment, since the production sharing contract (PSC)... does not permit a contractor to produce and sell migrated gas, the 3 November demand note said.

				In the digital economy, banks that have managed the transition to digital interfaces and e-commerce portals have the highest rated consumer experience, says a new survey. Banking and e-commerce are the leaders when it comes to providing consumer experience whereas the automotive industry, which includes four and two-wheelers, are at the bottom of the pack out of nine industries surveyed, by Hansa Customer Equity Pvt. Ltd. a marketing and analytics research firm. A common thread across the laggards is that they are industries where service delivery involves external stake holders like dealerships, travel offices, advisors and agents, said the study, based on a field survey, covering approximately 2,200 respondents while pointing out that five out of the nine sectors which include banking, e-commerce retail, healthcare and insurance offer above industry level expectations whereas the remaining fourairlines, travel services, four-wheelers and two-wheelers offer below industry level customer experience. Nearly four-fifths of the people surveyed are not happy with the customer experience they receive as it lacked on key parameters like ease of interaction, or achieving purpose, interaction satisfaction and information availability, said the survey which is one of the first of its kind based on consumer experience across nine industries in the top eight cities stratified for gender, socio-economic classification (A and B), age groups and geography. Interestingly, customers with larger discretionary spending capacities are perceiving a poor customer experience potentially eroding companies share of their wallets, said the survey. The benchmark for customer service is no longer your peer in the industry. Its the best consumer experience platform which could be a digital channel, said Swaminathan, chief executive officer and co-founder, Hansa Cequity, while explaining that digital channels are giving better experience than human channels and companies need to move towards hybrid channels which is a mix of automated and physical channels.To be sure, in-person accounts for the largest share of consumer interaction accounting for 61%, followed by website (17.5%), mobile app (11.5%) and phone call (7.8%). The usage of digital engagement channels of email, SMS and social media by customers for engagement is low at just 2%, said the survey while pointing out that a significant opportunity exists for companies to lower their costs of engagement by better leveraging email, SMS and social media. Also the satisfaction with these channels is very different. Customers are very satisfied with using mobile apps as a means to engage and have rated interactions with mobile apps as three times better than emails.

0.58,"Jyothy Laboratories Ltds share rose 4% on Tuesday. It has gained 22.7% in the last one month, outperforming the S&P BSE FMCG index, which is up a mere 1%.
				   
				The Jyothy Laboratories stocks rise began some days after its June quarter results were declared. That quarter saw its sales rise by 8.9% in value, lower than the 10.2% volume growth it returned. Thats a good volume growth to have, at a time when overall growth is slowing. The market expectation would be that the company can keep up this level of volume sales growth, especially as consumption growth is expected to revive, first in urban and then in rural parts of the country.Jyothy Laboratories had said that urban demand has improved though rural demand is yet to pick up, after its results were declared. A good monsoon is expected to pep up rural demand to an extent. What stands out in the companys case is it attained this growth despite an 11.3% decline in household insecticide sales. This segment contributes 8% of sales. An extended summer hit sales growth in this segment.Sales in fabric care, its main segment, rose by 10.8% and in dishwashing by 9.9%. These two segments contributed to over three-fourths of sales during the quarter. Its flagship Ujala fabric whiteners sales rose by 10% with the Henko brands growing by 9.6%. Personal care is a relatively small segment but did well with sales rising by 14.1%.Although sales grew in single digits, operating profit rose by 17.1% and margin gained by 1.3 percentage points over a year ago. Apart from a lower increase in raw material costs, advertisement and sales promotion expenses were flat during the quarter. Net profit rose by a much higher 77.9% but this was chiefly due to lower tax incidence during the quarter, although finance costs declined too.The rise in the stock signals high expectations that investors expect the companys operating performance will continue to be robust. That can also mean a continued improvement in its cash flows. In fiscal year 2016, Jyothy Laboratories net cash generated from operations rose by 24.5% to Rs191.5 crore. That should help partially fund its debt repayments. Debentures worth Rs400 crore  come up for repayment in November.Jyothy Laboratories shares are quite expensive, valued at 43 times estimated earnings, according to analyst estimates compiled by Reuters. Earlier, in June its shares had run-up on speculation that Henkel AG and Co. may exercise its option (which was pursuant to Jyothys acquisition of Henkel India in 2011) to take up to a 26% stake in the company in FY17.

				Adjusted pretax profit, which excludes one-time items, rose 7% from a year earlier to $5.59 billion, Europes largest bank said in a statement on Monday. That compared with the $5.29 billion average estimate of five analysts compiled by Bloomberg News.A UK regulators altered treatment of HSBCs stake in Chinas Bank of Communications Co. cut the British banks risk-weighted assets by $120.9 billion. That freed up $5.6 billion, which increased the lenders capital ratio and will help to support its dividend and any future share buybacks, as well as providing a buffer for the continuing uncertain regulatory environment, Gulliver said.This should be enough to allow the bank to maintain the dividend next year, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analysts led by Chirantan Barua said in a note. For yield investors who have been the source of support for valuation of this stock, this keeps the stock in the safety zone into the next six to nine months.The companys shares rose 2.3% in Hong Kong as of 1.28pm after earlier gaining as much as 3%.The banks common equity Tier 1 ratio rose to 13.9% from 12.1% three months earlier. That beat estimates of Morgan Stanley analysts, who expected an improvement to 12.9%.Almost six years into his tenure, Gulliver is striving to maintain revenue while paring global operations to trim $5 billion of annual expenses. His efforts to redeploy more assets into Asia have been complicated by Chinas slowing economy, while the bank is also navigating tougher capital rules, low interest rates and misconduct scandals.The stock had climbed 11% in London this year, the second-most among major European lenders behind Standard Chartered Plc at Fridays close. Both get the vast majority of their profit in Asia and report in dollars, limiting the impact of Britains vote to leave the European Union. Even so, HSBC still trades below its book value.Adjusted revenue gained 2.4% to $12.8 billion. Adjusted operating costs fell 3.5% to $7.25 billion, compared with the $7.33 billion average estimate of the five analysts surveyed.Since Gulliver started restructuring the bank in 2011, hes slashed headcount by about 44,000 and pledged 25,000 cuts last year, exiting at least 80 businesses. Globally, its retreated to 71 countries and territories from 88. Nevertheless, as with most European lenders, HSBC has been struggling to boost profitability. In August, management removed a target to surpass a 10% return on equity by the end of 2017, citing economic and political uncertainties, and stepped back from its progressive dividend policy.Adjusted pretax profit in Asia climbed 10% to $3.8 billion in the quarter from a year earlier, while Europe reported a 5.4% gain to $863 million.At the retail banking and wealth management division, adjusted profit rose to $1.8 billion from $1.5 billion a year earlier. In global banking and markets, which houses the investment bank, adjusted profit jumped to $2.5 billion from $1.93 billion in the period. The gain was primarily driven by the banks fixed-income businesses, which gained market share in Europe, HSBC said.Finance director Iain Mackay has said revenue is suffering because of record-low interest rates around the world, a particular problem for HSBC because it houses more than $400 billion of surplus deposits. Mackay said in August the lender would lose about $100 million of net interest income a year as a result of the Bank of England cutting its main interest rate by 25 basis points after Brexit.Adjusted loan impairment charges increased to $566 million in the third quarter from $434 million a year earlier.

-0.09,"New Delhi: The price paid for solar power in India at auction is set to fall below last years record lows for the South Asia nation, driven by plummeting panel prices, falling interest rates and competition among developers seeking a slice of the countrys renewables market.
				   
				Prices could dip lower than the Rs4.34 a kilowatt-hour offered in auctions held in Rajasthan a year ago, according to at least one developer of solar projects in India.This year we will see prices fall below Rs4 a kilowatt-hour for sure and it will be viable, said Rahul Munjal, chairman and managing director of Hero Future Energies Pvt., the clean-energy arm of Hero Group, one of Indias largest automakers.In 2016, countries from Chile to the United Arab Emirates broke records with deals to generate electricity from sunshine for less than 3 cents a kilowatt-hour, half the average global cost of coal power. With China and Japan joining the competitive-bidding bandwagon, as much as 25 gigawatts of solar capacity could be awarded through auctions this year globally, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.We feel interest rates will go down and the cost of solar panels will fall, so these will have a great effect on breaching the Rs4 a unit-mark, said Hero Futures Munjal, adding that hes looking at a 500 basis-point decline in domestic interest rates.Hero Future Energies, backed by the International Financial Corp., operates 360 megawatts of wind and solar capacity and has another 1.4 gigawatts of projects in the pipeline. The company plans to participate in some of the upcoming auctions.A decline in costs is one reason developers say prices at auction will drop.After falling 30% last year, the price of ordinary multi-crystalline silicon modules is expected to fall another 20% in 2017, according to London-based BNEF. Since 2009, solar prices are down 62%, with every part of the supply chain trimming costs.We expect these modules to sell for around $0.32 per watt, Jenny Chase, BNEFs chief solar analyst, said in a research note.Pent-up demand for nearly two gigawatts of solar capacity up for auctions in India in the early part of the year will also drive prices lower, said Rahul Goswami founder of Greenstone Energy Advisors, a boutique investment bank specializing in renewable energy deals in Asias third-largest economy.There is going to be a huge oversubscription in the coming auctions and everyone in 2017 will be looking at how do I go forward from my one gigawatt to 1.5 or 2 gigawatts, Goswami said in a phone interview, adding that fewer tenders in the last several months is adding to the pent-up demand.Auction processGreenstone, which is currently working to find an equity partner for Canadian renewable energy company SkyPower Ltds 350 megawatts of capacity under construction in India, concluded deals for 80 megawatts of solar capacity on behalf of Punj Lloyd Ltd in 2016. The investment bank also advised billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birlas Aditya Birla Nuvo Ltd on a tie-up with Dubai-based private equity investor The Abraaj Group to add solar power capacity in 2015.India is preparing to award 750 megawatts of solar capacity in Madhya Pradesh later this month and nearly 1 gigawatt more by March, according to state-run Solar Energy Corp. of India, the government agency that conducts Indias solar auctions.India adopted auctions in 2010 and is now racing to achieve Prime Minister Narendra Modis solar target of 100 gigawatts of capacity by 2022, a goal thats second only to China.Of the 25 gigawatts to be awarded through auctions, BNEFs Chase expects 8.5 gigawatts of that to be in India.

0.84,"New York: Facebook has a tortured but financially advantageous relationship with its suppliersthat is, the people and companies that keep the social network stocked with posts, photos and videos. Those people and companies make Facebook an entertaining hangout. And Facebook essentially keeps all the money generated there. But that is about to change.
				   
				Facebook will start to test slotting commercials into the middle of videos that media and entertainment companies publish on the social network, tech news publication Recode reported on Monday. And the company has agreed to let the video creators keep 55% of the money from those video ads, just as YouTube does. Facebook executives until now havent been wild about slotting in ads before or within videos. People will fixate on Facebooks flip-flop, but the much, much bigger deal is the compensation change for the media and entertainment companies that helped Facebook become the place where the world spends a huge share of its leisure hours. And the shift could damage the best business model in technology. Profit powerhouseOut of nearly 200 US companies with at least $15 billion in yearly sales, only five have wider operating profit margins than Facebook. For the most part, companies that publish political articles or cooking videos on Facebook dont make money directly from that material, although they use those items to assemble a big fan base and then point those people to websites and apps where the companies make money selling ads or subscriptions.Those articles and cooking videos keep users hanging out on Facebook, and the company keeps all the money it makes from selling advertisements that fill in gaps between those posts and videos they paid nothing to publish. It may not be fair, but it has made for a wildly successful and profitable business.If Facebook is now willing to give 55% of ad dollars from those video ads, that means cracks are emerging in Facebooks free ride with its army of content suppliers. Sharing money is more equitable but could damage Facebooks finances. Consider Alphabet Inc.s YouTube. The video website makes roughly one-third of the money Facebook generates from each user. Its not clear exactly why. Facebook may be doing a better job stuffing ads into every spot it can. Surely part of the gap is explained by Facebook paying almost nothing to stock the social network with posts, photos and video, while YouTube hands off 55 cents of every dollar it generates to the creators of popular videos.Facebook may be wagering that even if it must start giving away a cut of advertising money its worth it if companies have more financial incentives to create video for Facebook, which in turn will keep users coming back and staying for longer stretches. Facebook is an expert at making money from users attention. It may also be that Facebook had no choice.Some media and entertainment companies have started to complain about their inability to make money directly from videos and stories published on Facebook. It could be that Facebook is getting worried it will be left with too few cooking videos and Trump stories to keep users interested for hours.In any case, Facebooks crossing of the Rubicon on revenue sharing is an important moment. This could be the point in Facebooks development that helps it endure as the biggest and most valuable attention hog on the internet.

				So far, the company has done well after recovering from the microfinance crisis in Andhra Pradesh. In the March quarter, for instance, its assets under management (AUM) grew 84% from a year ago to Rs.7,677 crore. The increase in AUM was driven by a strong increase in the number of borrowersup 26%as well as an increase in the average ticket size (45%). Long-term loans now constitute close to 30%.The increase in AUM was also driven by loan disbursements, which rose 63% to Rs.4,066 crore. However, the growth in the volume of loans disbursed slowed to 29% from a year ago, compared with 49% in the December quarter, and remains a key yardstick for investors to track.SKSs non-interest income growth was 42% and the non-microfinance business now contributes close to 10% of net profit.

0.21,"Mumbai: Private sector lender Axis Bank Ltd on Thursday said net profit for the December quarter fell 73.4% from a year ago as bad loans continued to mount and provisions soared.
				   
				Net profit for the quarter stood at Rs579.57 crore as compared with Rs2,175.30 crore a year ago. A Bloomberg poll of 22 analysts had forecast a net profit of Rs830.30 crore.During the third quarter, the bank saw slippages worth Rs4,560 crore, largely in its so-called watch­list. The bank had, at the start of the year, created a list of corporate loans worth Rs22,628 crore which had a high probability of slipping into the non-performing category.In the nine months ended 31 December, about 51% or Rs11,537 crore had gone bad, with loans worth Rs2,698 crore going sour in October-December alone. However, slippages from the watchlist came down by 48% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. The bank also saw Rs1,631 crore worth loans slipping outside the list, of which Rs975 crore came from the banks corporate loan book.In a presentation, Axis Bank said that about 98% of the corporate slippages outside the watchlist were old loans which had been on the banks books since financial year 2010-11 or earlier. The total slippages seem to have turned the corner. The peak is behind us, said Jairam Sridharan, chief financial officer, Axis Bank.Provisions and contingencies rose 4.78% to Rs3,795.80 crore in the quarter from Rs3,622.74 crore a quarter ago. On a year-on-year basis, they surged 433% from Rs712.59 crore. With this, the banks provision coverage ratio rose to 64% from 60% earlier.The banks gross non-performing assets (NPAs) rose 220.9% to Rs20,466.82 crore at the end of the December quarter from Rs6,378.65 crore in the September quarter. On a year-on-year basis, it jumped 257.56% from Rs5,724.05 crore.As a percentage of total loans, gross NPAs stood at 5.22% at the end of the December quarter, as compared to 4.17% in the previous quarter and 1.68% in the year-ago quarter. Net NPAs were at 2.18% in the December quarter compared with 2.02% in the previous quarter and 0.75% in the same quarter last year.Net interest income (NII), or the core income a bank earns by giving loans, increased just 4.12% to Rs4,333.73 crore from Rs4,162.06 crore last year. Other income jumped 45.45% to Rs3,400.21 crore from Rs2,337.78 crore in the same period last year.Deposits rose 9.6% to Rs3.71 trillion while advances rose 10.1% to Rs3.47 trillion.While the banks retail loans showed a 19% growth year-on-year, corporate loans grew 4% and SME loans rose 5% from a year ago.We had earlier expected our credit growth to be in the high teens for this financial year. That might be a little optimistic right now. Weve moderated our expectations accordingly and we should mark a credit growth which is slightly lower, Sridharan said without giving any clear guidance for credit growth.Analysts believe that the slippages are along expected lines.The banks focus has been on cleaning up its books, which is a positive. We may not see much of a sharp correction in the stock price as most negatives have been factored in, said Siddharth Purohit, senior banking analyst at Angel Broking Ltd.Another private sector lender, Yes Bank Ltd, too announced its third quarter results on Thursday.Yes Banks net profit for the December quarter rose 30.62% to Rs882.63 crore compared with Rs675.74 crore a year ago. According to 17 analysts polled by Bloomberg, net profit forecast was at Rs822.10 crore.Net interest income increased 30.3% to Rs1,507.50 crore. Other income increased to Rs998.35 crorea rise of 33.81%.Kerala-based Federal Bank Ltd too reported a 26.38% increase in its net profit to Rs205.65 crore compared with Rs162.72 crore a year ago.

0.48,"Indias largest mobile services operator, two of the largest pharmaceutical companies, a top-tier IT services firm and the second largest tower infrastructure company have chosen the buyback route to return cash to shareholders this year. This is the first time so many large companies have announced buybacks in quick succession; fiscal year 2016-17 looks set to break all prior records with regards to share repurchases. Along with three large buybacks by government-owned companies, Indian companies have announced buybacks worth over Rs.2,1000 crore so far this year.
				   
				Of course, it will be a while before buybacks topple dividends as the preferred means to return cash. According to data collated by Mint Research, S&P BSE 100 companies alone paid dividends worth Rs.1.51 trillion in FY16. (See bit.ly/29xe7dk). In the same period, the amount spent on buybacks by all listed companies was only Rs.1,800 crore.But this may well be the beginning of a trend where buybacks are used nearly as much, if not more, as dividends to return cash. Research by Credit Suisse shows that in the US, S&P 500 companies spent $572 billion on buybacks in 2015, or 1.5 times of what they spent on dividends. For a number of shareholders, buybacks trump dividends both in terms of tax efficiency and the flexibility they offer. Ironically, in India, the government seems to have overplayed its hand and magnified the relative advantages of buybacks. In the 2016-17 Union budget, finance minister Arun Jaitley introduced an additional tax of 10% on any dividend income of more than Rs.10 lakh. Dividend distribution tax already amounted to 20.4% of payouts.For stocks that have been held for over a year, the buyback route entails a tax outgo of only 0.1%, which is essentially the securities transaction tax (STT) applicable for the transaction. Since 1 July 2015, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has allowed listed companies to make tender buyback offers through stock exchanges. For such transactions, long-term capital gains tax is exempt.Earlier, when companies werent allowed to make tender buyback offers through stock exchanges, investors would end up paying a 10% long-term capital gains tax. To be sure, buybacks through tender offers have picked up since FY16.For high dividend earners, the tax savings through a buyback issue are substantial. Bharti Airtel Ltd holds a 71.7% stake in Bharti Infratel Ltd. The latter has announced a buyback of Rs.2,000 crore. If the promoter tenders shares in proportion to its shareholding, it will take home more than Rs.1,400 crore after accounting for STT and other costs. If Infratel had chosen the dividend route instead, the net take home would be only around Rs.1,000 crore.There is likely to be increasing pressure from shareholders to shift to buybacks, given the tax efficiency. One likely pushback is that Sebi imposes a restriction on companies buying back sharesi.e. that they cant issue fresh equity for a period after the buyback. From a shareholders perspective, buybacks offer the flexibility of foregoing the payout by the company and staying fully invested with the company. They can do this by simply opting to not tender shares in the buyback. With dividends, there is no such option. Of course, one can always use dividend proceeds to buy additional shares, although academic studies show that reinvestment is typically rare and forms a fraction of all dividends received.Another peculiarity about buybacks is that while all shareholders are treated the same with dividends, the pricing of the buyback determines which category of shareholders benefit. Michael J. Mauboussin and Dan Callahan of Credit Suisse point out in a note titled Disbursing Cash to Shareholders, Buybacks benefit ongoing shareholders when management buys stock that is undervalued and benefit outgoing shareholders when the stock is overvalued. Since management should focus on building value per share for continuing shareholders, it should always try to buy back shares that are undervalued.This shouldnt normally matter in a tender offer, where investors can participate in the same proportion as their shareholding. Even so, empirical evidence shows that some shareholders fail to participate, even when they are incentivized by a substantial premium. Needless to say, investors need to keep a close eye on the pricing of the offer; but companies, too, would do well to avoid buybacks by paying a large premium.",2016-07-11,JdsOi2pXYKNjGVP8vvJUFP,"Along with three large share buybacks by government-owned companies, Indian companies have announced buybacks worth over ,2,1000 crore so far this year",01:58,Govts second dividend tax spurs buybacks

Having joined the body as a direct recruit officer in 1981, Sharma has served as the chief executive of its mortgage subsidiary LIC Housing Finance Ltd and zonal manager in charge of the south zone. Managing director at LIC, Sharma was already acting as chairman since September 16 when the then chairman S.K. Roy was relieved of his duties. Roy had resigned in June, nearly two years ahead of his retirement.Roy, appointed by the previous UPA government, had resigned nearly two years ahead of completion of his five-year term.

0.71,"A close relation of one of my friends, a senior executive at a multilateral agency for years now, is quite upset because her name does not feature in the media list of probables for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governors post. Ditto about an economist attached to an Indian think tank. This gentleman has stopped attending parties to avoid embarrassment of explaining to his peers why his name is not there.
				   
				In the past one month, since governor Raghuram Rajan made it public that he would not seek a reappointment, both print media and the TV channels are throwing up every possible name as his successor. The scene used to be very different on earlier occasions. Each time a governor was stepping down, only a handful of names would do the rounds as his possible successor. Among the names that appeared more than once was that of Montek Singh Ahluwalia. Lets take a look at the list this time around. I am putting them an alphabetical order to avoid giving an impression that I have a favourite or I think X has a better chance than Y.A: Arundhati Bhattacharya (chairman of State Bank of India), Arvind Panagariya (vice chairman of NITI Aayog, a government of India policy think tank that replaced Planning Commission), Arvind Subramanian (an economist and chief economic adviser to the government of India), Ashok Chawla (former chairman of Competition Commission of India), and Ashok Lahiri (former chief economic adviser to the government).B: Bimal Jalan (who had a stint as RBI governor between 1997 and 2003).J: Jugal Kishore Mohapatra (former rural development secretary).K: Kaushik Basu (former chief economic adviser to the government of India and now chief economist at the World Bank) and K.V. Kamath (head of the New Development Bank of the BRICS countries).P: Parthasarathi Shome (former adviser to Indian finance minister).R: Ratan Wattal (former finance secretary and now a liaison officer with the Jammu & Kashmir government to ensure flow of funds to the state on a fast track), R. Vaidyanathan (a professor at Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore), and Rakesh Mohan (a former RBI deputy governor).S: Shaktikanta Das (economic affairs secretary), Subir Gokarn (former RBI deputy governor and currently an executive director at the International Monetary Fund), and Sumit Bose (former finance secretary).U: U.K. Sinha (chairman of Securities and Exchange Board of India) and Urjit Patel (an RBI deputy governor).V: Vijay Kelkar (former finance secretary) and Vinod Rai (former Comptroller and Auditor General of India and now chairman of Bank Boards Bureau).Even after this, I may have missed a few names and apologize for that. There could be quite a few reasons behind so many names being cited as a possible successor to Rajan.One, many of the newspapers and TV channels indulge in speculation as they love to tell the world I told you so in case one of the many names being mentioned hits the bulls eye.Two, unlike in the past, there is a problem of plenty now and what we are witnessing is a fierce competition among a bunch of talented economists, bureaucrats and bankers for the job of Indias chief money man.Three, since we are relatively better off in terms of macroeconomic parameters, anybody can do this job. Jalan took over in the thick of east Asian crisis; D. Subbarao came in immediately after the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.; and Rajan occupied the seat when inflation was in double digits and the local currency was fast depreciating against the dollar. Now, we have a stable currency, relatively low inflation and low current account deficit.Finally, there could be trial balloons being floated by junior and not-so-junior bureaucrats through news-hungry media to gauge the public sentiment even as former governor Subbaraos tell-all book Who Moved My Interest Rate has queered the pitch for the government. Its a caution to the incumbent on the uneasy relationship that an RBI governor can have with the finance ministry and a message to the ministry that a governor, however close he is to the government before he moves to the central bank, can spill the beans after he is out.The media frenzy to find Rajans successor reminds one of what had happened when Ratan Tata was retiring as chairman of Tata Sons. The long list, published over months, had many names from India and overseas but not Cyrus P. Mistry who actually succeeded him when Tata retired in December 2012. No one will be surprised if a dark horse emerges from nowhere for the governors post.Whoever comes may not have an easy job at hand. In the past one month, since Rajan announced his decision to go back to the academic world, the level of rupee has remained unchanged but the 10-year government bond yield has dropped from 7.5% to 7.27% and most bank stocks have risen, some of them substantially. Bankex, the representative industry index on BSE, has risen 7.3%. Out of 39 listed banks, only five stocks have fallenthree of them are associates of the State Bank of India, besides Central Bank of India and Punjab & Sind Bank. Among public sector banks, Punjab National Bank has risen close to 44%, Allahabad Bank 36% and Indian Bank and Canara Bank, more than 25% each. Overall, 13 state-owned banks and six private banks have risen at least 10% and as much as 44% in past one month.Clearly, the market is factoring in two thingsin the new regime, interest rate will fall and the pressure on the banks to clean up their balance sheets will be diluted. And, of course, the government will continue to infuse capital in the state-owned banks without any conditions even as the brainstorming on bank consolidation to create a few large banks will continue for years without any solution in sight.

0.5,"Mumbai: Foreign brokerages gave a thumbs up to the budget and were largely relieved that the government did not opt for a populist budget, and adopted a balanced approach.
				   
				In the run-up to the budget, the predominant view was that the government may present a populist budget with an eye on the elections in Uttar Pradesh and also try to soothe the people at large after the negative growth impact of demonetisation.Contrary to the consensus view, but in line with our view, the government has presented a popular, but not a populist, budget, Nomura said in a note.The message from the budget is that the government continues to prioritize macro stability over growth. We believe this is a very strong and positive signal, given it was under significant pressure to tilt towards populism, Nomura analysts added.In a note, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofA-ML) analysts said that the budget seems to have resisted the temptation of a short-term economically and politically expedient fiscal expansion, by limiting fiscal year 2018 deficit at 3.2% of GDP. HSBC economic Pranjul Bhandari also pointed that the government signed up for a slightly higher fiscal deficit than the pre-existing target on the expected lines, but with a promise to continue on the consolidation path. The assumptions underlying the revenue and expenditure estimates were broadly realistic, according to Bhandari.Goldman Sachs pointed that the government struck  a balance between fiscal prudence and growth boost, while pointing that the main concern for the budget was whether the government should boost growth in the near term, against the macro backdrop of the economic slowdown after the demonetisation, or stick to fiscal consolidation. There was some disappointment though, and a pullback from the recent relief rally was not ruled out.That the budget did not have any punitive tax measure (such as capital gains on equities) is a relief; but in itself the exercise is unlikely to lead to noticeable earnings upgrades, BofA-ML said in the note.BofA- ML analysts said that sectors such as staples and cement may benefit from the rural focus, while banks may benefit from the focus on digital and affordable housing. Yet, we see little reason to change our Dec 17 end Sensex fair value estimate of 29,000. With the sharp post demonetisation rally, this leaves little upside room, and may imply some risk of a near term pull back, they added.BSEs 30-share Sensex closed 0.30% higher on Thursday at 28,226.61 pointsthe highest closing level since 4 October.With the budget behind us, the market will now focus on the polls in five statesUP, Punjab, Manipur, Uttarakhand and Goa, where elections are going to be held over February and March.

He and Subramanian both held a stake of around 25.5% in the company before the deal, he said. The announcement came within months of Rajarams divorce from Subramanian in May.Subramanian, who held multiple roles in Mu Sigma, including director of innovation, head of talent management and chief operating officer, before becoming CEO in February this year, will continue to serve on the board in a non-executive capacity.

We are extremely excited about being a partner and shareholder with Dhiraj and his management team and look forward to continuing to help build the company for many years to come, Mark Dzialga, chairman of General Atlantic, said in a statement.The divorce between Subramanian and Rajaram followed the departure in July last year of managing director Ganesh Lakshminarayanan, who had joined the company a year earlier. Mu Sigma had hired Lakshminarayanan, former Dell India president and managing director, in 2014 to lead its Indian operations. Chief financial officer Atul Bansal left the firm in March 2015.This apart, a string of senior executives have quit the firm since April this year, including Goutham Ekollu, head of operations; Anuj Krishna, a nine-year veteran at the company in charge of the companys business on the East Coast of the US; Aditya Kumbakonam, delivery unit lead; Manu Sharma, associate director; Adarsh Kumar, delivery leader; and Sankar Sekar, apprentice leader.It would be incorrect to say there has been no impact (from the separation between Rajaram and Subramanian). But the focus continues to be on the good work we are doing. There is a lot of demand for the narrative that we are offering. We have been one of the last companies to have started in the space. Mu Sigma is not about cost arbitrage. It is about innovation arbitrage, Rajaram said. He declined to comment on the companys valuation and revenue.The firm was valued at $1.5 billion when it raised $45 million in February 2013 in a round led by Mastercard.

0.34,"New Delhi: Power minister Piyush Goyal said on Thursday he was working on a proposal to revive stalled hydropower projects to enable them to sell power at a competitive tariff.
				   
				Addressing industry executives at The Verdict, the Mint-CNBC-TV18 conference on Budget 2017 in New Delhi, Goyal said his ministry will seek cabinet approval shortly on a proposal for financial re-engineering of stalled hydropower projects. He said the provision for budgetary support will be invoked as a last resort as it was vital for projects to be self sustaining.We are working on revitalizing hydropower and see if tariff can be less than Rs5 a unit. Hydropower projects in hill states have become expensive due to associated infrastructure requirements. Budgetary support may be the last resort, Goyal said, adding that the LED industry had become self sufficient and cost-competitive without government support. Former power secretary Anil Razdan, who was present on the occasion, said the 175 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity the government is targeting, requires a strong component of renewable energy storage capacity and other sources of power to balance the grid. Hydropower projects have a long gestation period of 2-10 years, he said. Many projects got stalled due to problems relating to land, finance, and promoters. Goyal said he would seek comments from all stakeholders, including NGOs, before finalizing the policy. The power ministry is keen to revive hydropower projects and attract fresh investments into this sector as it can be a valuable source of power that could balance the grid during the night and on cloudy days when solar energy supply drops.

-0.48,"Reserve Bank of Indias (RBIs) new stressed asset resolution scheme is the latest addition to a long list of band-aids for the bad loans problem. It does allow banks to take an effective haircut of 50% (by converting debt that cant be serviced by a firms current cash flows, into equity and equity-like instruments), but also creates a moral hazard.
				   
				Conversion of debt into equity or quasi-equity will help firms deleverage. Many promoters are likely to jump at this offer. Especially, as they can stay on if they sell or dilute their equity holdings. The central bank has said the amount of this sale/dilution should be equal to the haircut taken by banks; but given that the debt-to-market cap ratios of many firms with sizeable debt are greater than 10 times, is this likely to happen?In any case, equity is always written off before debt and this scheme shouldnt be an easy way out for irresponsible borrowers. Besides, after a dilution in shareholding, promoters may not be interested in turning around the company.For banks, this is a new tool to stem the fresh bad loans haemorrhage seen in the last two quarters. Even standard assets and those on the brink of slipping into bad loans can be taken into this scheme. But credit costs will rise since the scheme calls for higher provisioning. On the other hand, for loans which are already classified as bad, banks may be able to write back some provisions. On balance, it is likely that credit costs will rise through the current fiscal year and even in the first half of the next fiscal year if this scheme is implemented successfully.That implementation itself is a big if because of the stringent eligibility conditions attached, such as projects which have started commercial operations (forget power generators) and those that have debt of around Rs.500 crore. If their shareholding is substantially diluted, promoters may have little incentive to provide personal guarantee for the loan. A substantial dilution will also lead to a plunge in the market price of shares leading to huge mark-to-market losses for banks. So lenders might not be too keen to pursue this scheme.Overall, this scheme will likely help only those banks which have good provisioning cover and adequate capital in the first place. For state-owned banks which suffer on both these counts, this might not be an option. So, the scheme might not be enough to free up capital and kick-start lending.In all fairness to the central bank though, financial engineering is the only weapon left in its armoury. It cannot cut lending rates massively, something which will increase free cash flow of firms. The government doesnt have enough fiscal space for a huge capital injection into banks. Given the current set of circumstances, there is unlikely to be a sharp pickup in growth rates.If the economic slowdown continueswhich I think it willall these schemes will at best give marginal relief, said Hemindra Hazari, an independent banking analyst.",2016-06-14,K24CdmZKURcfSle4lzrmdN,"Why Reserve Bank of Indias new stressed asset resolution scheme is just another band aid for the bad loans problem

1.0,"Raj Dutt, a 35-year-old home furnishing retailer in Srinagar was among the many affected by the political turmoil in Kashmir. However, this did not dampen his entrepreneurial spirit and he found an innovative solutiona digital solution. 
				   
				Dutt leveraged the newly-launched sales assistant iPad app from a leading home furnishing company to create a new way of doing business. He went to his customers homes, showcasing the now digital product catalogue, helping them visualize interiors on the app itself and taking orders on the spot or bringing over the shortlisted fabric samples when needed. Now imagine doing this without the app, which would need him to carry close to 200 sample books to choose from, each weighing 10-15kg, for each home visit. In Dutts epic journey we find a true representation of the impact a thoughtfully-crafted digital solution can create in the right hands. Digital disruption in retail is often thought of as just a way of creating a new channel to sell, own or aggregate products or services via a cool app or e-commerce marketplace. But the true potential and value of digital is far more ubiquitous.For instance, geo-analytics, complemented by rich consumer data, today allows you to pinpoint exactly the right micro-markets for, say, a handset brand to launch new stores insomething that was based on experience earlier.Digital is not all about business-to-consumer (B2C). In B2B companies, lets say auto components, one of the top needs for customers quite often is transparency of order status and timely updates. Digital provides a strong way of seamlessly creating a platform where the customer can track his order from acceptance to manufacturing and from transport and delivery with pro-active intimation on potential delaysmaking his/her life much simpler. The advantages are manifold but the journey is never easy.We believe there are six key pillars for a successful digital transformation.Disruption and innovationRedefining the business model, from selling to servicing to feedback and improvement, is one of the first steps in the journey. More times than not, the consumer wont have answers you need directly (e.g. Henry Fords famous quip that if he were to ask his customers what they wanted, he would have built faster horses). Our lines of inquiry need to leverage trained specialists to tap into the discipline of ethnographic research and understand unmet or latent needs. Amazon Echo Dot or Google Home are excellent examples of creating a new needa digital assistant that is a news reader, home lighting controller, travel agent and Wikipedia rolled into one.Customer journeys re-imaginedDefining seamless and integrated consumer journeys across all touch-points is next. If technology has defined progress in the last decade, then design thinking is the flavour of the next one. Imagine someone refurnishing their home can shortlist the fabrics you like on your app while commuting, visualize the shortlisted products as upholstery or curtains on your laptop, get advice from family and friends and finally find the nearest store to touch the actual fabric and complete the purchaseall through beautifully designed screens in a few clicks.Agile development and launch Executing these ambitions requires a considered approachchoosing the right partners and technology platform, getting the data right, even finding the right product photography solution to a life-like product display, testing the digital product and planning the digital marketing right. The focus has to be on creating the MVP (minimum viable product) and then enhancing and refining it through each sprint for iterative upgrades.Creating data and analyst capability Data is the new oil, it is said, and the key here is unlocking consumer data at the front end and operations data at the back end. It is possible today to target a person, who searched for a car, with an auto-insurance offer that is customized for him depending on his profile (demographics, interests) at another website that he frequents. Every penny of yours can be optimized to target the right person in the right geography at the right time and the right place to personalize the right offering and maximize the return on investment.Adoption and commercializationEach digital investment should have a clear lens on commercial value, tracked actively through a sharply-defined dashboard. Adoption is among the toughest challenges in the journeyespecially, converting a users interest to not only, say, a potential download, but actual usage, transaction and, most important (but most difficult), repeat engagementwhile at the same time, doing so at the least cost per click.Digitization of processA chain is as good as the weakest link. A sports car chassis with an 800cc engine will not create an optimum consumer experienceneither will the most-innovatively designed agile customer process with a 1990s back-end. Hence, digitizing of the core processes through a clear integrated view of the information technology (IT) architecture and associated applications and making choices around niche versus diverse platforms needs thoughtful consideration.Digital is a realityit is not a dotcom boom or bust. It is already the current way of working and organizations have a choiceto embrace itor die.Rajiv Gupta is partner and head of technology advantage practice, Bharat Mimani is project leader, and Amrita Chang is consultant at BCG India.",2017-01-16,K52MthnRAmw8bKYv3TkwHN,Digital provides a strong way of seamlessly creating a platform where the customer can track his order from acceptance to manufacturing and from transport and delivery with pro-active intimation on potential delays,00:45,How to unlock a brands true digital potential
0.02,"New York: The companys top priority is adding users, but it hasnt lured many of them. Revenue shifted from perky to pokey. One potential buyer after another ran screaming from the deal table. Twitter fired 9% of its staff as it tries to change the conversation from its disappearing growth to potential profits. 
				   
				And now one of the key grown-ups at Twitter is heading for the exits. Adam Bain, the operating chief and long time head of advertising salesthe only part of Twitter that was functional (for a while) is stepping down after six years to explore opportunities outside the company.Its hard not to wonder if Bain stuck around through a revolving door of Twitter CEOs over the years only to give up after the recent layoffs hit his advertising team hard. Twitter declined to offer revenue forecasts for the current quarter because the job cuts and an overhaul of the ad sales staff made it too tough to predict the business. Its only one quarter of unpredictability, but it shows how tinkering with the companys revenue engine has an uncertain effect on sales. Regardless of the reason for Bains departure, Twitter is already a joke for how often it cycles through senior executives. This merely adds to the punchline. It makes the company that can seemingly do nothing right look even more dysfunctional.In response, Twitters shares fell about 3% in after-hours trading after they had closed higher in the regular market day on Wednesday.Twitter said Anthony Noto, the companys powerful chief financial officer, is sliding into Bains COO job and will give up the CFO post once Twitter finds a qualified successor. Its an interesting job swap, although it reflects Notos expansive responsibilities at the company. CEO Jack Dorsey is more of a spiritual leader and strategy guru rather than a day-to-day executive functionary. With Bain gone, Twitter needs to lean even more on Noto. Its Noto or bust. As Twitters executive suite hollows out more, it seems even more odd that Dorsey continues to hold two CEO posts, at Twitter and Square Inc. Ive called for Dorsey to pick one; Twitter is simply too bruised and battered to have a distracted part-time chief executive.The Twitter board apparently continues to back Dorsey and isnt forcing him to pick between jobs.

Net sales rose to Rs2,346.18 crore, a 35.1% increase from Rs1,736.20 crore reported in the year-ago period.Results for the quarter and nine months ended 30 September 2016 are not entirely comparable with the results of the corresponding periods due to the Maggi noodles issue in 2015 and rebuild of the Maggi noodles business in 2016, Nestle India said in a statement to the BSE.In the same quarter last year, Nestle India could not sell Maggi noodles after the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) ordered the company to withdraw the snack item, which accounted for about 30% of the companys revenue.The FSSAI order, which was overturned by the Bombay high court in August 2015, was based on allegations that Maggi noodles contained monosodium glutamate, and lead in excess of prescribed limits.In the quarter just gone by, Nestle Indias domestic market grew 37.9% and exports increased by 5.1%.Our growth was broad-based across categories aided by a spate of innovations and renovation of over 25 new products launched in the recent past.

0.58,"San Francisco: Tracy Chou wrote a post on Medium in October 2013, challenging tech companies to tell the world what percentage of their software engineers were women. Surprisingly, it worked: Google, Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and others published their lopsided race and gender statistics, and Chou, then a Pinterest software engineer, became a face of the tech diversity movement. 
				   
				Pinterest positioned itself as a company working hard to hire more women as well as black and Latino workers. In 2015, the company made an unprecedented move: it published a set of diversity-focused hiring goals. It would strive to make 30% of its engineering hires women, and it would report on its progress in a year.Sixteen months later, Pinterest retreated. Despite all its efforts, only 22% of its new engineers were women, and in response, the company lowered its goal for next year from 30% to 25%. It had hit and exceeded its targets in two other categoriesmaking 8% of its engineering hires under-represented ethnic minorities, for example. Pinterest said it missed its women in engineering goal because it focused on hiring more senior women, which takes longer. But its admission that it had missed its mark and would lower expectations was a disappointment. Obviously we were all hoping it would be better and closer to 30%, said Chou, who left the company in June. Pinterests head of diversity, Candice Morgan, said the company sets goals that are challenging and that it thinks it has a 70% chance of reaching.ALSO READ | Why India needs more working womenPinterests big goaland its later retrenchmentshow how tech companies diversity ambitions can come with their own set of messes and challenges. In the two years since tech giants first revealed how most of their employees were white and Asian men, their diversity has only increased a few percentage points  or, in some cases, dropped. Most companies first response was to try to make their hiring processes more blind: stripping resumes of names and pictures, for example, to keep out information that might unintentionally bias an interviewer for or against a candidate.Now, some companies want to do more than cover their eyes. Its not enough to just publish demographic data and scrub names and pictures from resumes. Unlike other companies, Twitter and Pinterest set specific hiring goals. Facebook rewarded its recruiters extra for diversity hires. Microsoft is tying managers bonuses to their diversity hiring after the proportion of female workers fell for two consecutive years. Even small startups  like Penny, a four-person personal finance company in San Francisco thats the subject of the latest episode of Bloombergs Decrypted podcast  are evaluating candidates on whether they bring a new perspective to the team, in addition to their technical skills. Some companies are embracing affirmative action hiring, even if they are careful to call it something else.I have quite a few clients saying, We want to take it one step further, or saying, Listen, we did the unconscious bias thing, and we didnt get a lot out of it, said Y-Vonne Hutchinson, a diversity consultant who works with startups and helped found Project Include, a group of diversity advocates who publish guides of best practices for companies. Its happening in a way that wasnt happening last year.Hutchinson encourages companies to explore new tactics, but she also warns them to prepare for resistance. Affirmative action gets a lot of blowback, but it was one of the most successful ways of getting people from under-represented groups into jobs and institutions they were excluded from, Hutchinson said. Shes African-American, and she said affirmative action helped her mother get a federal government job. I dont think tech has embraced affirmative action because theyre really married to the idea of a meritocracy.ALSO READ | The HR trends of 2017Instead of calling it affirmative action, companies are looking for a policy that looks like that, talks like that, but isnt perceived as that, Hutchinson said. Companies want to discuss equal opportunity without the terms quotas and affirmative action, she said.Should tech companies ignore a candidates background when deciding whether to hire themor should they factor it in? The debate is ongoing, said Chou, who is also part of Project Include. (She said she left Pinterest not out of disappointment, but because she wanted to try something new.)Itd be cleaner and easier if making the hiring process blind suddenly led to more women and minorities being hired, but thats often insufficient, Chou said. Active policies to promote diversity, on the other hand, can strike some job candidates as unjust. People feel its an unfair judgment on them if they get turned down and someone they feel is objectively less than them in some way is hired, she said.At Pinterest, the pressure of reporting public hiring goals could be felt inside the company. That internal conversationWere not going to hit this, and its going to look really bad if we dontmade people haul ass and get their shit together, Chou said. Morgan, Pinterests head of diversity, wrote in an email: Setting public goals focused and encouraged the team to have more authentic conversations and learn more about how to make meaningful progress ... Theyve resulted in the most diverse team Pinterest has had to date.Pinterest asked some of its employees to recommend a certain number of candidates from under-represented groups for jobs at Pinterest, and some workers felt those goals were unfairly distributed, Chou said. Some employees pushed back when they were encouraged to refer the same number of people as a larger team and asked if the referrals should be prorated, she said. It was a little frustrating to hear the grumblings but also not that surprising, as people tend to grumble about any extra work that theyre asked to do, Chou said. Morgan said the company later tailored its requests based on feedback from engineering leaders.At Facebook, recruiters in 2015 were told to prioritize finding diversity candidatesengineers that werent white or Asian men, according to former recruiters who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to talk about their work. After a few months, the recruiters became frustrated, because they said most of their minority engineering candidates didnt end up getting an offer. From 2015 to 2016, the number of women in technology roles at Facebook increased 1 %, and its proportion of black and Latino workers stayed flat. Two former recruiters blamed the engineering departments hiring process, which gave veto power to a small group of engineering leaders that signed off on every offer. Though Facebook pushed recruiters to look for diversity, those making hiring decisions were not held accountable to those same goals, according to the former recruiters.Even when the hires are made, other employees may grow resentful. GitHub, a site where coders can store and share their work, hired consultant Nicole Sanchez in 2015 to create and lead its Social Impact team, which focuses on improving diversity efforts. The team is now 11 out of the companys 600 employees, and it pushed strongly for more diversity among the people who interviewed job seekers, the company said.Some employees groused. Two former GitHub employees said the Social Impact team would question hiring practices and choices and ruled with a heavy hand. The former employees, who declined to be identified out of fear of reprisal from the company, also alleged that GitHub sometimes missed out on the best talent by focusing too much on a candidates background. A GitHub spokeswoman declined to comment.When tech companies talk about hiring, they often talk about bringing in the best person possible and ignoring everything else. For many, best has meant the person whos most technically skilled or who will be shipping code the soonest after they start.But some are redefining best to factor in diversity. At Penny, which builds a chatbot that texts users analysis and advice about their spending, chief executive officer (CEO) Mitchell Lee wanted the companys fifth hire to add diversity to the team. He spent the fall looking for candidates who were different from the four men who already worked there  affirmative action hiring, in his own words.ALSO READ: Snapchat picks London for its international headquartersWhen I say affirmative action, I mean I want to be able to see someones picture, Lee said. If asked to choose between two hypothetical candidates who are equally qualified for a job at Penny, then he rejects the premise as false: Those two people are not equally qualified. Somebody with a diverse background and a totally different perspective is more qualified for the position were trying to fill, which is expanding upon the collective viewpoint of what Penny has, he said.Lee found that some candidates were dropping out of the interview process along the way, and they were often those he was particularly interested in  women or people with unusual backgrounds. He started checking in with those candidates more frequently, encouraging them along the way. It helped. But he said it showed him how much more was needed beyond getting diverse candidates in the mix: He needed to earn the trust of many of them. Its really hard to convey, especially if youre like me and youre a white guy in his mid-twenties trying to tell candidates that diversity is something you care about, he said.In December, after several months of searchingLee estimates he looked through hundreds of candidatesPenny hired a fifth person, Vertika Srivastava, an Indian-American woman who went to the University of Michigan and worked as a software developer at Accenture. The four current employees are excited for her to start. But Lee and the other Penny workersthey all had a saywaffled when deciding whether to give her an offer. Pennys developers code mostly in Ruby, a programming language Srivastava doesnt have much experience in.At one point during the interview process, Srivastava asked the four Penny guys why they were interested in her. They listed some aspects of her personality, and they were blunt: It was also because shes a woman. I liked that they didnt tiptoe around that, she said. She starts this week.Pennys approach is different than that of most companies. Pinterest and Twitter dont talk about quotas; they talk about hiring goals. Stacy Brown-Philpot, the African-American CEO of TaskRabbit, an on-demand job platform, has pledged to make the companys workforce represent the ethnic and racial makeup of the country. She said on stage at a conference in October that in order to get there, the company will need to over-index on certain groups, though she followed that up with: I dont know if I would say its affirmative action.Slack, a $3.8 billion workplace chat service startup, practices intentional hiring, said Leslie Miley, its director of engineering and a diversity advocate. The company actively looks for people outside of the standard 20 schools and six companies, he said, and they value what historically hasnt been valued in Silicon Valley. That means measuring people by distance travelledhow far theyve come in life instead of just looking for a Stanford computer science degree. Miley said that candidates who would score higher on this metric could include those who were the first in their family to go to college, or are veterans, or went to community college.But Miley dislikes the term affirmative action. The amount of baggage attached to that term is horrid, he said. When you say affirmative action, the very next question most people have is, Are we going to lower the bar? So lets not call it that.

				Speaking at the Mint conference on Bankruptcy ActImpact of the new law on the banking landscape on 24 October, Sudarshan Sen, executive director of Reserve Bank of India, clarified that the new regulation will be another tool for banks to resolve stressed assets.Sen said lenders will no longer have to wait for accounts to turn bad. The new regulation will empower all lenders to take action even before the problem manifests. Under the insolvency regulation, a default will be resolved within 270 days of registration of a bankruptcy application. However, he expressed doubts about whether banks would come forward to invoke the insolvency process as it would attract higher provisions.Sen added that information utilities formed under the new regulation should perform the role of aggregators. There are already a number of primary gatherers of information like the credit information bureaus. If we take these bureaus as information utilities, we must remember these were created to meet certain specific objectives which are laid down in law. We must not lose sight of those objectives while at the same time leveraging what they have to subserve the information utilities in future, he said.However, Sen said even as India has the best of schemes, there are not enough people to implement them. According to him, quality, quantity and certification will be the bedrock on which the success or failure of this grand leap forwardis going to depend.He also said there is a need to make sure the transition to the new insolvency regulation system is smooth as all cases should not be transferred to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) from day one.",2016-11-02,KCAE2uvgB54HpDCLtzbykL,"The new regulation will empower all lenders to take action even before the problem manifests, says RBI executive director Sudarshan Sen",00:44,Insolvency and bankruptcy code wont replace SDR and S4A: Sudarshan Sen
0.25,"Mumbai: Dry powderthe amount of cash with private equity (PE)/venture capital (VC) fundsstands close to a six-year high of $7.1 billion, data from private deal tracker Preqin shows, suggesting an improved fund-raising environment.
				   
				Preqin data shows that following a low of $2.1 billion in fund-raising by India-based funds in 2012, the industry has managed to raise $3.4 billion and $3.8 billion in 2014 and 2015, respectively.There is a fair amount of appetite for Indian funds, both private equity, venture capital and those investing in public markets. The number of enquiries that we have witnessed in the last six months is higher than what we had seen in the previous two years, said Rajesh Begur, founder and managing partner of law firm ARA Law.Sentiment around the Indian economy is positive, given programmes such as Make In India, improving ease of doing business and the relatively favourable macroeconomic factors vis-a-vis other emerging economies, he added.The improved sentiment is reflected in the number of fund managers that are in the market to raise money.According to a Mint analysis, several other established PE firms are in the market to collectively raise over $3 billion worth of capital. PE firms that are in the process of raising capital from investors include IDFC Alternatives ($500 million), ChrysCapital ($650 million), PE veteran Ajay Relans CX Partners ($400 million), Tata Opportunities Fund ($600 million), Aditya Birla Private Equity ($500 million) and growth capital funds Tata Growth Equity ($350 million), Tano Capital ($200 million) and Motilal Oswal Private Equity ($300 million).Several-first time fund managers are, meanwhile, trying to raise almost $2 billion, Mint reported in July.The high amount of dry powder coincides with a sharp decline in deal volume in the Indian market.According to data from VCCEdge, in the nine months to 30 September, 945 PE deals worth $8.8 billion were recorded, which in terms of deal volume was lower by 47.3% from the previous year.Limited partners, or investors in PE/VC funds, believe the slowdown in deal volume at a time when funds are sitting on a large amount of cash is a sign of increased discipline among fund managers.I dont think the slowdown in deal volume is a reflection of either the quality or quantity of opportunity available. It is more an influence of the growing investing discipline that fund managers are exercising today as compared to the 2007-08 vintages, said Nupur Garg, regional lead, South Asia, private equity and venture funds at International Finance Corp (IFC).Valuations too have played a part in deal volume slowdown, resulting in funds sitting on a larger amount of cash.There has been a significant reduction in the number of transactions, with high valuation expectations being the primary reason. People are looking for fewer deals, but good deals at right valuations, said Begur of ARA Law.Data also shows that increasingly more dry powder has got concentrated with a few established fund managers.Of the $7.1 billion dry powder, almost $5.59 billion or close to 80% is with established funds.Data also shows that the top five funds with the most dry powder are holding close to $2.8 billion. These include funds such as Everstone Capital ($654.9 million), Multiples Alternate Asset Management ($577.5 million) and Nexus Venture Partners ($551.9 million).The share of first-time fund managers has fallen to around 20% compared to 2011, when they had almost 35% of the dry powder. As of November, first-time fund managers held around $1.51 billion worth of dry powder.The number of fund managers in the market has reduced and capital is getting concentrated in the hands of fewer fund managers. The appetite for first-time funds has improved in the last few years, with some of the first-time teams bringing prior private equity experience to the tablebut there are only a few first-time funds being raised, said Garg of IFC.A significant increase in dry powder is also attributable to VC funds.The dry powder available with VC funds has almost doubled to $3.1 billion as of November, compared to a figure of $1.5 billion at the end of calendar year 2011.Data shows that venture capital deals saw a decline of 39% in terms of number of deals and 58% in terms of deal value for the nine months ended 30 September, having registered 267 transactions worth $1.98 billion.",2016-11-11,KDsiIBoGmugc0dP4BXtrCI,"India-based funds have $7.1 bn of dry powder, shows data from deal tracker Preqin",00:20,Cash hoard of PE/VC funds at six-year high
0.07,"Kolkata: The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) has agreed to meter household water consumption under pressure from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) which is financially assisting the overhauling of the citys underground piped water distribution network, two officials at the municipal body said.
				   
				It will take years but eventually, consumption in each household will be measured, the officials said on condition of anonymity, adding there is no plan immediately to impose any new tax.Because the move could be seen as a precursor to charging water consumption, there was political resistance to the move from within the ruling Trinamool Congress, according to key leaders of the party, who asked not to be identified.Still, KMC agreed to the reform to raise financial resources for the much-needed repair of underground water pipes, they added.In the older part of the city, where the first of these projects is to be implemented, the network dates back to the time the British-ruled India.KMC recently awarded a six-year contract to Suez Environnement India Ltd for the repair of its piped water distribution network in six wards in the Cossipore neighbourhood of north Kolkata, a project financed by ADB.As part of the 30 million project, Suez will install or replace 25,000 domestic meters, the company said in a statement. That apart, 25 district metering units are to be installed in the neighbourhood to accurately map wastage or excessive use of water.According to Suez estimates in a press statement, water loss in the Cossipore neighbourhood due to ageing pipes at a whopping 60%, spread across its 150-km network. The projects immediate aim is to reduce the leakage and lay the grounds for transition from intermittent to round-the-clock water supply to an estimated 200,000 residents, Suez added.After overhauling the distribution network, Suez will provide support with operation and maintenance for three years. During this phase, it will work towards increasing network performance with the use of modern technology for quick leak detection. It will also help KMC with customer service, according to a company statement on the contract.KMC will soon award similar contracts to two similar neighbourhoods, the officials cited earlier said.However, Kolkata mayor Sovan Chattopadhyay told  Mint the KMC had on  its own decided to install meters to measure water consumption, and that the funding assistance from ADB had nothing to do with it. ADB agreed to lend for the project in recognition of the various development initiatives taken by the state government, he claimed.Though on completion of these projects, water consumption will be measured in every home, chief minister Mamata Banerjee has no plans whatsoever to impose any new tax, he added.KMC will generate enough revenues from existing taxes to repay ADBs loan without putting any new burden on citizens of Kolkata, according to Chattopadhyay.The reform will make water distribution more efficient and lead to substantial savings in operating costs, the KMC officials said. Still, repaying the loan will be a challenge for the municipal body unless it is able to shore up tax revenues, they added.",2017-01-10,KFwcCgu1MR6bgbXt2qR99O,Kolkata Municipal Corporation has agreed to the reform to raise financial resources for the much-needed repair of underground water pipes,19:30,Kolkata municipal body to meter household water consumption under ADB pressure
0.28,"Calls for winding down the rate regulatorTariff Authority for Major Ports, or TAMPfor 11 of the 12 ports owned by the Indian government have always come from port investors affected by rate cuts.
				   
				The investors have argued that Indias ability to attract private funds into its state-run ports would depend to a large extent on freeing rates from regulatory control.After years of debate, the government has finally decided to scrap TAMP when it goes for an overhaul of the institutional structure of these 11 ports by converting them to authorities from the trustee set-up under which they are currently run.But shippers (cargo owners) and their trade bodies, a key stake holder in the export-import business, have raised a red flag.Im not in favour of regulation; but Im in favour of a tariff oversight. I dont want somebody to fix the tariff, but if I find that the tariff levied by the terminals are unreasonable, I should have somebody who should be able to check it, says R. Venkatesh, president of the Western India Shippers Association, a body representing exporters and importers in Indias western region.For instance, at Jawaharlal Nehru Port, Indias biggest container gateway, if all the container terminals join hands and then kind of collude, they dont openly collude, but they collude in a fashion where they are going to control the tariff, then shippers should have some authority to go to, Venkatesh says.Who do I have when you remove everything?There should be some dispute resolution forum to address such grievances.The government, shippers say, cannot relinquish its duties towards oversight.Cartels continue to exist in the maritime industry in spite of fairly stringent anti-trust laws in the US and Europe. In an industry (ports) which has a big impact on a countrys economy or on its economic competitiveness, the government has to be especially watchful, according to shippers.So, you must have a watchdog body of some form. If you dont want to call it TAMP, dont call it TAMP. But it should be a body which should have some sort of oversight over what is happening; somewhere you can go and at least file the necessary documents. We cannot expect everyone to follow the rules. You need to have a policeman standing at the signals just to ensure that nobody jumps the signal; and when he jumps, he is punished, Venkatesh says.To be sure, the shipping ministry has addressed this concern partially in the Major Ports Authorities Bill to be introduced in Parliament.The bill has provisions for setting up an independent review board, which will be tasked with, among other things, to look after the functions envisaged to be carried out by TAMP arising from the tariff-setting guidelines of 2005, 2008 and 2013, and the tariff orders issued by TAMP.The review board would also look into the complaints received from port users against services and terms of service rendered by major ports (a term used to refer to ports owned by the Indian government) or the private operators operating in the major ports and to pass necessary orders after hearing the parties concerned.Any party not satisfied with the order of the review board shall be free to resort to arbitration or other available legal remedy, according to the Major Port Authorities Bill.Shippers, however, are not convinced. Because this provision refers only to services and service terms of ports and private terminal operators without specifically mentioning rates.Erstwhile governments have been reluctant to free rates at the 11 ports, which, along with Kamarajar port (the only Indian government port that is run as a company) at Ennore near Chennai, account for some 57% of the countrys external trade shipped by the sea route because of its impact on the logistics costs over such a large portion of Indias export-import trade.Even the Narendra Modi government itself took more than two years to decide on removing TAMP as part of the institutional reform of the major ports.Assuming that the bill has a smooth passage in Parliament, it may still take at least 18 to 24 months for converting the port trusts into authorities. The real action will start only then.P.

-0.05,"Mumbai: Gamesa Renewable Pvt. Ltd, the local unit of Spanish wind turbine maker Gamesa Corp Tecnologica SA, expects to maintain its top position in the Indian market as it installs wind energy capacity at its fastest pace, chairman and managing director Ramesh Kymal said
				   
				Gamesa Renewable, which became Indias largest wind turbine maker three years ago by wresting market share from rival Suzlon Energy Ltd, plans to install 1,600 megawatt (MW) of wind capacity for various independent power producers (IPPs) this year, Kymal said in a phone interview on 2 November.The company, a late entrant in the countrys wind-turbine market, has already installed wind capacity of about 3500MW or 3.5 gigawatt (GW) for its customers in India till date. In comparison, Suzlon has installed more than 9.5GW of wind capacity, but it was built over a longer period of time. It took us four years to install the first 1,000 MW, and another 17 months for the next 1,000MW. Then we installed the next 1,000MW in nine months and now we will do the next 1,000MW in just four months. Thats the kind of growth we are seeing because we are focused on the IPP sector. Ninety-eight percent of our sales come from the IPPs, he said. Inox Wind Ltd  and Gamesa have a significantly higher share of sales in IPPs compared with Suzlon Energy, which has a bigger share of investor clients, who look for tax benefits from accelerated depreciation. But that is changing as Suzlon also is trying to increase its share of IPP clients. Gamesa had a 29% market share in fiscal 2016 while Suzlon Energy and Inox had a market share of 26% and 23%, respectively. Suzlon wants to reclaim the  50% share it once had, founder Tulsi Tanti said in an interview earlier this year.  (bit.ly/20SM4W1)We have gained market share from the earlier market leaders... We are likely to be the number one this year too. We would like to maintain our market share at 30-35% and we do not have the overarching ambition to achieve 40% or 50%, Kymal said.Cumulatively, the order book of Gamesa, Inox and Suzlon  touched about 3.4GW as of 31 March, IDFC Securities Ltd analysts Shirish Rane and Mohit Kumar wrote in a 25 October note. We expect the Indian wind turbine market size to touch 4.3-4.5GW (per annum) in FY17E on the back of healthy order book of Suzlon, Inox and Gamesa India, they wrote. Gamesa counts ReNew Power Ventures Pvt. Ltd, Hero Future Energies, Orange Renewables, Tata Power Co. Ltd, Ostro Energy Pvt. Ltd, and Greenko Energy Holdings among its customers. Parent Gamesa had in November 2014 committed 100 million in investment for expansion of facilities in India. The Indian unit changed its name to Gamesa Renewable from Gamesa Wind Turbine Pvt. Ltd after entering the solar energy market. It plans to build about 160MW-200MW of solar energy capacity on the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) model.Kymal said the Indian unit is now locally manufacturing inverters used in solar projects from earlier importing them from Spain. This is helping it earn higher margins in building these projects even as low solar tariffs mean margins for EPC companies have been squeezed. Suzlon, which last year won 210MW of solar projects, too is focusing on the solar EPC market. In June, Gamesa announced it plans to merge its wind business with those of German engineering company Siemens AG. The merger, which is expected to close by March 2017, will not see any changes in the India business, given Siemens is not present in wind in India, Kymal said.Apart from Suzlon, Inox Wind and Gamesa, wind equipment makers in the country include WinWinD and ReGen Powertech Pvt. Ltd. Large wind IPPs include Welspun Renewables Ltd (now under Tata Power), Goldman Sachs-backed ReNew Power, Morgan Stanley-owned Continuum Wind Energy Ltd, and JP Morgan-backed Leap Green Energy Pvt.

0.14,"Bengaluru: Rising Straits Capital, the asset management firm founded by Subhash Bedi, has set up a real estate-focused non-banking financial company (NBFC) to lend funds to cash-strapped developers, mimicking moves by private equity investors.
				   
				Rising Straits has acquired an existing NBFC and is raising around $100 million from a financial investor to capitalize the NBFC, which has been named Rising Straits Finance Co. Pvt. Ltd. The NBFC will start lending operations from the beginning of 2017 with around $150 million, including capital infused internally.Apart from the regular residential and office projects, the new NBFC will also lend to projects in the logistics, hospitality and healthcare sectors. Traditional banking channels are unable to fill the funding gap in the sector today, which is why so many NBFCs are coming up. NBFCs are stepping in to address those gaps, said Bedi, chairman and managing director, Rising Straits Capital. Bedi, who also co-founded Red Fort Capital, said that the NBFC will take off with $100-150 million and then increase it to about $300 million of debt. Mint wrote in a 13 September article that Rising Straits Capital was in the process of acquiring an NBFC. Rising Straits is currently also raising capital from offshore investors, through the managed account route, to invest in real estate projects. In a managed account, a few large limited partners (LP) participate, instead of multiple investors in a blind pool format.So far we have got commitment of around $300 million. We will be investing in both residential and office projects, that are in early stage or under construction, Bedi said. This would be Rising Straits first fundraising after it was formed last year, following a separation between Red Fort Capital co-founders Bedi and Parry Singh. As part of the separation, Bedi sold his stake in Red Fort Capitals NBFC.There has been a slew of new real estate NBFCs entering the market. NBFCs, which primarily offer debt through various structured instruments, today are directly competing with private equity (PE) funds, with the latter mainly doing debt and non-equity deals. With NBFCs getting aggressive, real estate developers now have greater access to capital though the money comes at a high price.  NBFCs provide innovative financing and flexible repayment terms that banks typically, dont offer.

0.35,"New Delhi: In order to encourage banks to provide education loans, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has said rescheduling of payment period of such loans due to unemployment of borrower will not be treated as restructured accounts for computing NPAs. 
				   
				Banks may allow up to three spells of moratorium (not exceeding 6 months each) during life cycle of education loan, taking into account spells of unemployment/underemployment, without treating the exercise as restructuring, RBI said in a letter to the Indian Banks Association (IBA). However, banks would be required to maintain a higher provisioning of 5% during the additional moratorium period and one year thereafter. The RBIs response was on a clarification sought by the IBA whether the education loans with extended repayment period be treated as restructured loans. The facility of extended repayment period and increased number of moratorium for repayment may be extended to existing borrowers whose accounts are classified as standard..., said the RBI. As per RBIs master circular of July 2015, accounts that are restructured from April 2015 will attract higher provisioning and will be classified as NPA. In 2013, the department of financial services (DFS) had notified that if the repayments in education loans are extended due to revision in the repayment period, the same may not be treated as restructuring. IBA had written to RBI to confirm that the notification of DFS of 2013 holds good even now and that banks need not treat such extended repayment period of education loans as restructuring. IBA said the relaxation in repayment of loans is needed as it may so happen that a borrower fails to get a good income or a job if the market has a slow-down.

0.0,"Shares of Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) jumped nearly 3% on Tuesday after the firm beat analysts estimates on all operating parameters for the September quarter. But order inflows were poor and they paint a gloomy picture of the economy.
				   
				First, a look at the positives that drove the stock price up. Dogged execution and the 12% year-on-year (y-o-y) increase in net revenue were many notches higher that what the Street expected. Along with this, the firms tight control on expenses, be it raw material costs, employee costs or other expenses helped BHEL post a Rs155 crore operating profit from a loss in the year-ago period. This compares with Bloombergs consensus estimate of a profit of Rs68 crore. BHELs net profit of Rs109 crore was a huge 82% above consensus estimates.But one cannot overlook the negatives. In sharp contrast to the profit outperformance was the paltry Rs1,800 crore order inflow during the quarter, down 30% from a year ago. The first six months tally of Rs4,800 crore is barely one-fifth of what the firm secured in the previous comparable period. The order backlog fell to Rs1.03 trillion as opposed to Rs1.12 trillion a year ago. This is of concern as it points to a paucity of capital investment both in the power sector and industry.To add to this, the management, in its analysts concall, has stated that some existing orders may be cancelled. Investors are also aware that a large part of the order book is in slow-moving projects, which may lead to slower revenue growth in the future.If that happens, there is a lurking danger of the firm slipping again on the profitability front. After all, its operating margin was a wafer-thin 2.3% during the September quarter.Lack of orders is a grave concern in light of the firms massive capacity. BHELs capacity for boiler-turbine-generator is 20 gigawatts (GW) and the entire industry pipeline of estimated orders is much lower. According to a report by Jefferies Equity Research, BHELs return on equity (RoE) will peak at 7% over the next two-to-three years. At 100% capacity utilization, it would achieve an ROE of 13%, it says, adding that this is before the 7th Pay Commission changes come into consideration.

0.85,"The Street seems to be betting that the government may announce incentives for scrapping old trucks. Among the biggest beneficiaries would be Ashok Leyland Ltd, as this step will translate into demand for new trucks to replace the old ones. Will this trigger a rally in the stock?
				   
				The going has been good for Leyland, the countrys second largest truck maker, in the last several months. Robust truck and bus sales and steady rise in profitability led to a 25% jump in the stock price since last July. It trades at 10.5 times the estimated earnings for fiscal year 2017, a fair price given that the positives are factored into this valuation.In the near term, budget-related indirect sops for the auto sector may trigger a euphoric rally. But a sustained upmove for the stock will come from rising sales and market share. Ashok Leylands share in trucks has inched up steadily from 20% to 24% in the last couple of years, although Tata Motors Ltd remains the undisputed No. 1, with nearly twice Leylands share. Note that higher market share in future would be a bigger struggle, given that there are new entrants like Volvo, Bharat Benz, etc. in the fray.The big bet for the near term is the scrapping of old trucks. Yes, this will force transporters to buy new ones. But the impact for truck makers depends on the age and type of trucks included and the nature and quantum of incentive announced, if at all.The Street is also hopeful that any infrastructure boost by the government will, in the long run, lift demand for tippers, even as general economic recovery raises demand for commercial vehicles. If this happens, Ashok Leylands growth rate could continue to outpace that of the industry on account of its niche product portfolio that caters to segments across infrastructure. For the December quarter, it posted a 38% volume growth as opposed to an industry growth of about 22%.According to Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd, unless government spending and the manufacturing sector improve significantly, fiscal year 2017 could be a pretty lacklustre year.Sustained sales growth is important to improve profitability as only with higher production will economies of scale kick in. December quarter operating margin no doubt was 343 basis points (bps) higher at 10%. But, this came on the back of a huge fall in raw material costs too. A basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.From these levels, higher profitability can come mainly from higher sales.

0.63,"San Francisco: Amazon.com Inc plans to invest $1.49 billion to build a large air cargo hub in northern Kentucky, state officials said on Tuesday, stoking expectations it may one day opt to directly compete with FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc.
				   
				The worlds biggest online retailer has agreed to a 50-year lease for about 900 acres of property from Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airportclose in size to the global hubs of top cargo airlines.Amazon is handling more shipping in-house so it can deliver packages to customers faster, as well as cut costs and uncertainty associated with relying on third parties. It has said its moves are designed to supplement, not replace cargo carriers.Analysts suspect it has larger ambitions.We estimate a $400 billion-plus market opportunity for Amazon in delivery, freight forwarding, and contract logistics, Colin Sebastian, an analyst for Baird Equity Research, said in a note to clients.Amazon, which has not announced a start date for the hub, said it expects to create more than 2,000 jobs when the site opens.The northern Kentucky locationnot far from UPSs major hubputs Amazons aircraft in shooting distance of top cities. The company said last year it would lease 40 Boeing Co 767 planes, 16 of which are currently in service.It also lets Amazons trucks reach 11 fulfillment centres in the state. And a large operation of Deutsche Post DHL there lets Amazon transfer packages easily abroad, said Brian Clancy, managing director of advisory firm Logistics Capital & Strategy LLC.As part of the investment, Amazon anticipates it will spend nearly $462 million on building and improvements over an unspecified number of years, according to a report by the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority.The authoritys board tentatively approved $40 million in tax incentives for Amazon over 10 years if it meets hiring commitments, with average wages including benefits targeted at $26 per hour, the report said.So far, Amazon has loaded its aircraft with big but lightweight boxes, according to data reviewed by Reuters and interviews with airport officials around the United States.

0.62,"Southern India is leading electricity consumption growth in the country. Electricity usage in the regions five states and the Union territories of Puducherry and Lakshadweep grew 8.8% in April-November 2016, shows data compiled by Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd. 
				   
				Comparatively the country as a whole has seen a growth of 5.1% during the period. Consumption is high in states where rainfall is low. Tamil Nadu, which has been declared drought-hit by the state government, saw a 12% rise in electricity usage. Karnataka, which also saw scanty rains, has seen a 10% rise in power usage, points out Motilal Oswal, citing data from Central Electricity Authority.CSR adoption by Indian companies on the riseThe spending of listed Indian companies on corporate social responsibility (CSR) is rising and the proportion of firms spending closer to 2% of profits is going up, according to a report by Crisil Foundation. Spending on CSR was up by 22% in fiscal year 2016 over a year ago. Larger companies reported improved compliance, with 53% of those with sales of over Rs10,000 crore spending 2% or more of profit on CSR during FY16, compared to 31% in the year earlier. Among smaller firms, 57% with sales of Rs100-500 crore and 56% with sales of Rs500-10,000 crore reported spending 2% or more. Of course, this can also be seen as a cup half empty, as there is a long way to go before a majority of companies become compliant with the 2% spending rule. Three sectors most responsible for the underperformance are information technology, telecom and financial services, which together contribute one-third of the net profit of listed firms.EM commodity exporters surprise on the trade frontWhatever good news there is in emerging markets (EMs) trade data is largely a story about commodity exporters, Citi Research said in a report last week. The chart shows that the balance of export surprises versus overall economic surprises is considerably greater for commodity exporters than it has been for manufacturing exporters. Citi does caution about data limitations, as it generates data from a small group of countries but says its conclusion fits with two other facts. Firstly, there has been a highly visible recovery in commodity prices.

1.0,"Tokyo:  Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs at least $100 billion more to finance countrys goals for clean energy even after his governments policies brought in record investment in wind and solar power stations.
				   
				Thats the conclusion of a report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, which found $10.5 billion flew into renewables in India for the fiscal year ended 31 March, almost 60% more than the $6.6 billion invested two years ago. It also said 7.3 gigawatts of clean-energy projects were built for the latest fiscal year, which is 71% higher than the previous period.The findings represent the broadest assessment yet of the money going into Indias clean-energy industry. Growth in the renewables business has helped India become the third-biggest power market in the world after China and the US, according to the BNEF report. Modi has set a goal of building 175 gigawatts of clean-energy capacity by 2022 to supply more of the 62 million households that lack access to reliable grids and feed demand for electricity thats projected to rise fourfold by 2040.Hes taking the right steps, but the targets are quite ambitious, said Shantanu Jaiswal, the lead author of the report at BNEF. The question is where do people get the money$100 billion is a lot of money for this industry, especially given where were starting from.An investment of $100 billion is equivalent to almost 5% of all the goods and services produced annually by the nation of 1.3 billion people, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Diversified financingThe report, sponsored by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, a US non-profit working to mitigate climate change with renewable energy, was released at BNEFs conference in Shanghai on Tuesday. It also found that India has installed clean-energy capacity of 42.6 gigawatts. That accounts for 14% of the nations total generation capacity, up from 12.5% three years ago.Jaiswal said the nation needs to diversify its sources of finances to reach the goal, bringing in big international banks to complement the lending done by Indias state-backed institutions and the development banks active in the country. It also needs to reduce the cost of debt financing for solar projects, which is more than double the rate charged in China and six times interest rates available in Japan, according to the report.State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank, along with Axis Bank Ltd and Yes Bank Ltd, have helped supply much of the finance along with non-bank lenders such as Tata Cleantech Capital Ltd and L&T Finance Ltd. Development institutions include the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency, the World Banks International Finance Corp., the Asian Development Bank and KFW of Germany.The huge capital needed to meet the targets, as well as the high cost of capital, mean that fundraising from the public markets will be critically important, according to the report. Along with green bonds, India is turning to infrastructure investment trusts, which are used to free up and recycle developers capital stuck in operational projects by securitizing the revenue streams and offering the units on the public market.The arrangement, expected to help the inflow of foreign capital and reduce the exposure of domestic financial institutions, was approved in September 2014 by the Securities and Exchange Board of India. Infrastructure investment trusts are similar to yieldcos in helping developers combine multiple projects.To create safeguards for investors in infrastructure investment trusts, regulators have set a requirement for a minimum number of independent directors in the investment management firm and have also placed restrictions on transactions done between related parties, according to the report.India also needs to improve on the management of power distribution companies, according to BNEFs Jaiswal.Right now, Indias power distribution utilities are in huge debts, so they dont buy power even when theres demand, Jaiswal said.Retailers held total debt of almost Rs.4.1 trillion ($60 billion) at the end of March 2015, Power Minister Piyush Goyal said in August.

0.25,"Bengaluru: Wipro Ltd, which launched its artificial intelligence (AI) platform Holmes 18 months ago, is now making its biggest push to embrace automation by allowing more of its managers to identify work which will not require engineers in each of the over 20,000 projects currently underway.
				   
				This bold development, according to one executive who did not want to be identified will mean Wipro doesnt just save on costs (thereby arresting falling profitability), but fundamentally alters the traditional model of deploying armies of engineers to undertake maintenance work.To be sure, that could also mean that its current workforce needs to learn new technology skills swiftly to stay relevant.Wipro is in the process of appointing individual leaders in each of the six industry-serving segments (which the company calls strategic business units) and five solution offering verticals or practices, who will be entrusted with the job of automating mundane maintenance work.Until now, Wipros chief technology officer K.R. Sanjiv, in consultation with various segment heads used to decide which projects could use Holmes. Wipros two larger rivals, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd, too have a similar centralized division that oversees the adoption of their respective intelligent automation platforms, Ignio and Mana. This explains why these companies, which employ hundreds of thousands of engineers, have embraced automation only in tiny pockets.At Wipro, this will now change. We announced internally in this quarter that we will have a more federated structure than running it from a central unit, which will further increase the pace (of adoption), Abidali Neemuchwala, chief executive officer of Wipro said last month.Hyper-automation is one of the central pillars of Neemuchwalas vision of making Wipro a $15 billion firm by 2020 with an operating margin of 23%. Wipro ended the year to March with $7.35 billion in revenue and 20.5% profitability. Wipro is consolidating all its automation assets and capabilities under the Holmes brand and significantly increasing its investment in hyper-automation. Going forward, every strategic business unit, service line and delivery unit will have dedicated leaders for Holmes, said a spokesperson for Wipro. They will be responsible for adoption of the existing capability and ideation of new use cases.In the first six months of the current financial year, Wipro claims to have freed and redeployed over 4,300 employees in newer areas of work, on account of automation. The managements decision to decentralize decision-making means Wipro could look to automate work of close to 10,000 engineers by the end of the financial year, according to a second executive who spoke on condition of anonymity.We are well ahead of our plan for the financial year. (But) we will not be able to provide information beyond what has so far been disclosed publicly, said the spokesperson.Experts are encouraged by the managements decision.Aligned with a market maturation around the broad notion of Intelligent Automation, Wipro is changing gears in the way it is engaging with stakeholders, said Thomas Reuner, the managing director at IT outsourcing advisory, HfS Research.Each of these Holmes leaders will be evaluated on the work they can automate. All of them will have individual targets, said the second executive. Until now, much of the work (that has been automated) is what is maintenance or L0 type. Hopefully, as we push automation, more L1 or L2 (higher order) work in areas such as application development or even software writing can be automated.Wipros aggressive push towards embracing automation comes at a time when automation platforms and cloud computing are threatening to erase the labour arbitrage enjoyed by Indian IT vendors.Still, Wipro, which has focused on demonstrating robust delivery and learning the lessons from the early deployments of its AI platform, will now, much like its peers, demonstrate that it can manage the transition from labour arbitration to automation in profitable manner, said Reuner.",2016-11-02,MfyyMa0zsQOTnJQGmZqHqK,Wipro is appointing individual leaders in each of the six industry-serving segments and five solution-offering verticals to reduce mundane maintenance work,04:35,Wipro in biggest automation push since launch of Holmes AI platform
1.0,"New Delhi: With its eyes set on doubling Indias present installed wind power by 2022, the ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE) has revised guidelines for onshore wind power projects. 
				   
				At present (till end-September), India has 28.1 giga watt (GW) of wind power installed capacity across the country and the Central government has set an ambitious target of generating 60GW by 2022. To achieve that target, MNRE believes that the current rate of deployment of wind power capacity is required to be more than doubled. The guidelines were revised to address new-age problems and reduce delays.India first came out with guidelines for development of onshore wind power projects in 1995 to ensure proper growth of the wind power sector. The guidelines were then revised in 1996. Since then, this is the first major revision.The guidelines aim to facilitate development of wind power projects in an efficient, cost effective and environmentally benign manner. They address all major issues like land use permission, availability of wind resource, grid connectivity, transport logistics, environmental acceptability, micrositing, health and safety, hybridization, repowering and decommission plan.The project developer should ensure that the land being selected for the wind power project can be legally used for the purpose and all regulations regarding land use/land cover are complied with, said the guidelines which were issued on 22 October. They clarified that in case of land allotment by the state government for the wind power project, a maximum period of four years may be allowed for development and start of commissioning of the project. But if there is a delay, then the land allotment may be cancelled.To address the issue of grid connectivity, the guidelines said that the project developer should ensure that grid connectivity is technically and commercially feasible at the site selected.If the site being selected falls in the area of forest land or in the vicinity of habitat of migratory birds and their flight routes, civil aviation, defence and heritage establishments the project developer should ensure availability of necessary clearances from concerning authorities, they added.It added that to ensure health and safety of people working/residing near the wind power installations the NIWE (National Institute of Wind Energy) will prescribe criteria for noise and shadow flicker in consultation with stakeholders.The guidelines also stated that a proposal to establish wind power project should necessarily include a decommissioning plan of the wind turbine after completion of its useful life.The NIWE will formulate guidelines for decommissioning of the wind turbines in consultation with stakeholders, it added.As per the MNRE, the need for such guidelines were felt because of advancement in the wind turbine technology, requirement to comply various standards and regulations issued by CEA (Central Electricity Authority) and other regulatory bodies, to address issues related to micrositing, decommissioning, health and safety.For instance, over the past 20 years, the wind turbine technology in India has evolved from less efficient turbines with low capacity of 225 KW to more efficient turbines with high capacity of 3 mega watt being manufactured in India.Indias total installed renewable capacity currently is around 44.2GW and significance of wind power in India can be assumed from the fact it amounts to over 60% of the total installed renewable power. India is globally ranked fourth in terms of wind power installed capacity.",2016-11-02,Ml9Urs18BVl7hvF1geHyrI,The Centre revises guidelines for onshore wind power projects to meet ambitious target of generating 60GW of wind power by 2022,11:06,Onshore wind power project norms revised in boost to Modis clean energy goal
0.52,"Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd is the bright spot in the Adani Group. Its earnings are growing consistently and the company is outperforming the sector on cargo volumes and expects to do well in the rest of the fiscal year.
				   
				Compared to 4% growth in the industry, Adani Ports clocked 7% rise in volumes in the June quarter. Helped by market share gains and addition of new ports and facilities, the company expects volumes to rise 10-15% in the current fiscal year. Last fiscal year, it grew 5%. Comparatively, volumes at its peer Gujarat Pipavav Port Ltd fell in the June quarter and analysts at best expect the firm to report flat or low-single-digit volume growth for the full fiscal year.Still, Adani Ports valuations are at a discount to Gujarat Pipavav, whose performance and outlook is nothing much to talk about. Adani Ports price-to-earnings multiple is at around 15 times the current fiscal year earnings per share estimate, while Gujarat Pipavav is trading at about 28 times. Even on enterprise value to Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization), Gujarat Pipavav is valued better, shows data compiled by Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd.Gujarat Pipavav is seen to be a relatively developed asset. Adani Ports is still in expansion modeboth through organic and inorganic routes. But that does not fully explain the valuations discount. The reason for this is related-party transactions and the perception that promoters are leveraging Adani Ports to fuel the growth of the group.Despite generating Rs2,867 crore of profit in fiscal year 2016, the companys borrowings (long term+short term) went up by a fourth during FY16. And a significant part of this borrowed money was loaned to third parties. From a meagre Rs68 crore in March 2015, loans rose to Rs2,922 crore in March 2016.Not surprisingly, the development earned the ire of investors, who sent the stock lower after the March quarter results. Recognizing the damage, Adani Ports began taking corrective measures. In a June quarter results call with analysts, the management said that it plans to reduce loans by Rs1,000 crore by the September quarter (Q2)-end and wipe them out completely by the end of the current fiscal year.While the comments helped the stock recover after the June quarter results, the quantum of loan reduction and commentary on future plans at the September quarter results announcement will determine the rerating potential of the stock. It should be noted that the stock, even after the recent recovery, is still lower than where it was a year ago.If Adani Ports delivers on the loan reduction promise, then the stock can rerate, say analysts. That will not only help it save on finance costs and conserve earnings but will also give investors the confidence that the companys financial strength is being put to the right usei.e., to grow its business and earnings.",2016-10-04,Mwr0x5tTCusdEZyb2O2DiI,"Helped by market share gains and addition of new ports and facilities, Adani Ports expects volumes to rise 10-15% in the current fiscal year",00:43,Will second quarter be a breakout one for Adani Ports?
0.07,"Wipro Ltd has underperformed peers for so long that expectations from it typically run low. It was no different with the companys March quarter results announcement; analysts were expecting organic growth of only around 1% compared with the December quarter.
				   
				But Wipro fell short of even these low expectations. Its revenues were flat after adjusting for the impact of two acquisitions it closed during the March quarter. Worse still, it has guided for between 1% and 3% growth for the June quarter, even though the full contribution of the HealthPlan Services acquisition will add about two percentage points to growth. At the mid-point of its guidance, therefore, organic growth is again expected to be flat.While Wipro has taken various steps to stem the decline in its growth rate, the fruit of these actions is still not visible. Apart from the troubles in the energy and utilities industry, which contributes to 15% of total revenue, the company is also grappling now with challenges some of its banking and financial services clients in Continental Europe are facing. In the energy and utilities segment, Wipro said that discretionary spending will come back when there is some stability in gas prices. Meanwhile, the gap vis-à-vis industry growth rates has only widened. On a year-on-year basis, growth in organic revenue stood at merely 3.7% in the March quarter. The industry is growing at around 10% in dollar terms. Margins were below estimates, too, despite an unexpected pickup in employee utilization benefits from the rupees depreciation. The company said that margins in its India and Middle East business fell because of certain investments, whereas commensurate revenues from these initiatives are still to be recognized.The only silver lining was the companys announcement for buy-back worth Rs.2,500 crore. Of course, the promoters are likely to receive a large portion of this, in proportion to their 73% stake. Even so, the buy-back using the tender offer route is a tax-efficient way to return cash to shareholders. Along with the dividends announced for the year, Wipro has increased its payout ratio to 48% in fiscal year 2015-16. In FY15, it paid shareholders 41% of the years profit, and in the preceding four years, its payout was around 30% of net profit. The higher payout will result in better return ratios, and the lower cash balance could act as a hurdle against large and risky acquisitions.But the positives from the buy-back are captured in the companys shares, which have risen by nearly 10% in the past five trading sessions.

0.24,"Bengaluru: Piramal Finance Pvt. Ltd, which houses the entire financial services business of the Piramal Group, will start lending to smaller corporate groups, form a joint venture platform for slum redevelopment investments, lend to new sectors and begin housing finance operations in four months time, said a company executive. 
				   
				The Mumbai-based firm is setting up a new line of business where it will focus on emerging corporate lending, for transactions of Rs30-90 crore, similar to lending to small and medium enterprises (SME), a segment it hasnt tapped so far.  The year started with Piramal Finance announcing its new housing finance business, where 70-75% of its lending book will offer housing finance to individuals and the rest will comprise of construction loans of up to Rs 50 crore to small developers.Under the real estate investment business, the company is at an advanced stage of forming a joint venture with another investor to do equity and structured lending deals in slum redevelopment projects in Mumbai. Apart from achieving growth, the underlying theme this year is to diversify our portfolio and adopt a retail-centric approach towards lending. There is huge potential to expand our lending base and it is in line with our strategy to improve the quality of our lending book as well as diversify risks, said Khushru Jijina, managing director at Piramal Finance.Piramal Enterprises Ltd (PEL) has recently completed a second and conclusive restructuring of its financial services business, by moving all assets and liabilities related to lending to real estate and non-real estate projects to its unit, Piramal Finance. Last year, the financial services business was first restructured and integrated in a prelude to the spin-off of the unit and PELs healthcare business.Piramal Finances Structured Finance Group (SFG) or its non-real estate lending business is expected to grow significantly this year. SFGs lending book is expected to double in 6-8 months from Rs2,160 crore as of September, Jijina said. SFG has already started lending to new sectors such as cement, entertainment, and security services and is actively evaluating other sectors such as engineering, healthcare, and automotive components. Lending will be a mix of senior debt, loan against shares and structured debt which will include large transactions of Rs800-900 crore as well as smaller Rs150-200 crore deals. Jijina said a large portion of the companys growth will come from SFG this year and the pace of growth may even be faster than its staple real estate funding business. Piramal Finances real estate book, which includes both debt and private equity funds, deployed and as well as sanctioned loans that have not been disbursed, was around Rs35,000 crore as on 31 December, 2016. FOR WEBWe saw green shoots of recovery in real estate till October, after which demonetization impacted customer sentiment and sales dipped. We have reached out to our developer partners asking them not to stop construction and have offered additional financing to complete construction, Jijina said. Besides the slum redevelopment investment plans, Piramal will also set up a $300 million equity platform with a Canadian pension fund in a couple of months. Under its flexible lease rental discounting (LRD) model, which was launched last November in a bid to diversify into commercial realty, the company has already signed three deals of Rs1,500 crore and disbursed and sanctioned funds for LRD are expected to touch Rs10,000 crore in the next 15-18 months. While structured debt lending and equity investments to residential projects will continue, Jijina said he sees a lot more growth in rent-yielding stabilized assets. Last year, Piramal announced a proposed credit limit of Rs15,000 crore to top-of-the line developers to enable them to grow faster. Around 60% of this has already been committed and the firm is now taking this ahead and planning to offer holistic funding solutions to established developers, not on a project basis but to iron out cash flow mismatches. It will invest in large deals of Rs1,000 crore and above.  Piramals next strategy of growth will be to capture new accounts, offer new products and retain existing clients. The group has gone about building their (financial services) platform in an organized manner, where they started with real estate and then moved to non-real estate and then to housing finance, which gives them wider reach, said Nitin Gupta, managing director, Macquarie Capital. In real estate, Gupta said Piramal will continue doing large ticket deals because that differentiates them from the others. Their business approach is good. They understand the pain points of developers and offer them financing solutions, he said.",2017-01-25,N9rLeGpT6nkcNFV47eHH3J,"Piramal Finance also seeks to form a JV for slum redevelopment investments, lend to new sectors and begin housing finance in four months time",23:50,"Piramal Finance to start home loans in four months, eyes small corporate lending too"

Communications, which is still the single largest business vertical for Tech Mahindra, registered 1.7% sequential growth in revenue. In constant currency terms, the division is said to have grown by 3%.Where the company did not impress or exceed expectations is profitability. Despite the favourable baseQ2 has seen one-time restructuring expensesthe Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin expanded just 80 basis points to 15.7%. According to an analyst with a domestic broking firm, adjusting for the Q2 restructuring expense, the margin would drop 40 basis points. But then, as the analyst clarifies, margins can see volatility on a quarterly basis as the company integrates recent acquisitions. A basis point is 0.01%.Management commentary otherwise is encouraging. The management expects the enterprise business vertical to have outperformed the industry in the last quarter and it expects the momentum to continue. The company signed a large deal in the BFSI division and said its focus on a portfolio of services and geographical diversification is helping it overcome business volatility.In a conference call with analysts, the management alluded to a recovery in the troubled communications business, citing a large order win. The number of active clients has risen to 837 from 825 in Q2 and 801 in the year-ago quarter. Client additions were highest in the $1-10 million contract category.While the commentary should comfort investors who otherwise are worried about the overall slowdown in the IT (information technology) sector, profitability remains a weak link in Tech Mahindra. It is reducing costs through automation, which should aid profitability.The savings, however, can be undermined by wage hikes (scheduled in the next quarter, though a decision is yet to be taken). Also clouding the margin outlook is the change in political regime in the US and fear that the country will raise visa costs for IT employees.

0.24,"New York/ London/ Bengaluru: British consumer goods maker Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc is in advanced talks to buy baby formula maker Mead Johnson Nutrition Co for $16.7 billion, in a deal that would take it in a new direction and boost its business in Asia.
				   
				Reckitt, which is best known for its cleaning and over-the-counter health products, said late on Wednesday it was in talks to offer $90 in cash for each Mead Johnson share, a 29.5% premium to the stocks closing price.Shares of Mead Johnson, long rumoured to be a takeover target for Danone or Nestle S.A., jumped 22% in after-market trading. At 0808 GMT, Reckitt shares in London were up 3.7% at 7,084 pence.Mead Johnson, which makes Enfamil baby formula, has been seen as a bid target since being spun off from drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2009, due in part to its big presence in Latin America and Asia, regions with fast-growing populations.Reckitt, which makes Durex condoms, Nurofen tablets, Lysol cleaners and Scholl footcare products, was not seen as an obvious buyer given it is not in the baby food business and its overall food business is very small.Still, Reckitts focus on consumer health products, or health-related goods sold over the counter, makes Mead Johnson a good fit, analysts said.Its a branded consumer proposition with healthcare-y attributes, said RBC Capital Markets analysts, adding the absence of any product overlap meant antitrust scrutiny would be minimal.Reckitts proposed price represents a multiple of 17 times Mead Johnsons estimated 2017 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), said analysts at Wells Fargo, falling short of the 20 times Nestle paid for Wyeth in 2012 and the 22 times Danone paid for Numico in 2007.Still, the premium is in line with other recent consumer staples deals, and is appropriate given regulatory changes in China and price promotion, the analysts said.Reckitt said it expected to finance the proposed deal through cash and debt.The parties are presently engaged in a period of due diligence and contract discussion, it said in a statement. Mead Johnson also confirmed the discussions in a statement.People familiar with the matter told Reuters in 2014 that Danone was interested in buying Mead Johnson but the French company has since agreed to buy WhiteWave, known for its soy- and nut-based milks, reducing the chances of a counterbid.Speculation regarding a bid by Nestle recently resurfaced after a media report citing unidentified sources, yet Nestles existing baby formula business would likely throw up antitrust concerns.The Wall Street Journal first reported on the talks.

0.91,"New Delhi: India may be a bright spot for global solar markets this year as it adds capacity at a record pace, becoming one of the top regions for panel producers struggling with rock-bottom prices.
				   
				India is expected to add nearly twice as much new solar as last year, outpacing once-booming Japan, according to forecasts by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF). China, the worlds largest renewables market, will see solar growth dip by about a fifth after peaking in 2016, London-based BNEF predicts.Bolstered by Prime Minister Narendra Modis ambitious clean-energy goals, Indias rising appetite for solar power spells good news for Chinese solar cell and module manufacturers including Trina Solar Ltd and Hanwha Q Cells Co. It comes after the global spot market price for solar panels fell to a record low amid slowing demand elsewhere.India pipped Japan to become the top importer of solar cells and modules from China for three out of 10 months last year and the trend will continue in 2017, according to Xiaoting Wang, a Hong Kong-based solar analyst at BNEF.India will account for 10 to 13% of global new build in the next couple of years, and its market fluctuation will have an important impact on the short-term supply-demand relationship and therefore the pricing environment, Wang said.India and Latin America are among key growth markets for solar panels, Trina Solar chief executive officer Gao Jifan said in an interview this week at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland.Also read: Investment Corp. of Dubai eyes India renewable energy investmentsThe worlds second-most populous nation is likely to add about 8.9 gigawatts of new solar in 2017, nearly twice the 4.5 gigawatts last year, according to BNEFs most conservative estimate. Japans new solar capacity may drop to about 6 gigawatts from 8.9 gigawatts in 2016, while China is estimated to fall to about 21.6 gigawatts from about 26.5 gigawatts last year.To be sure, Indias solar capacity is still small compared with China, the worlds largest solar market, and Japan. The South Asian nation has nearly nine gigawatts of solar installations, just a third of Japans 30.2 gigawatts and a little over a tenth of Chinas estimated 80 gigawatts at the end of 2016.While India races against time to meet Modis goal of installing 100 gigawatts of capacity by 2022, China scaled back its target by 27 percent to 105 gigawatts by 2020 under its 13th five-year plan amid stagnating electricity demand and a slowing economy.The five-year plan marks the beginning of a new era of reduced investment in renewables, BNEF said in its China Outlook for the second half of 2016, adding that it expects 2016 to be the near-term peak for new installed solar capacity in the worlds second-largest economy.Also read: Amplus plans acquisition of solar power firm Kiran EnergyAccording to BNEF chairman Michael Liebreich, one of the less welcome developments of 2016 was that wind and solar investment fell from their peaks in both China and Japan.This came as a major jolt to the sector, after many years of seemingly inexorable growth, Liebreich said in his yearly review for 2016.Japans solar installations for 2016 are estimated at 8.6 gigawatts to 9.2 gigawatts, lower than in 2015, according to BNEFs forecast. The drop comes as the country scales back generous incentive tariffs.China and Japan are now planning to adopt auctions. While India has conducted auctions since 2010 to build solar projects, Japan has promised to introduce the mechanism this year in a bid to lower the subsidies developers receive.Japans new solar installs peaked in 2015 when the country added 11.5 gigawatts of capacity, according to BNEF data.China, which has built most of its solar capacity under feed-in-tariffs, or government-set prices, is reducing these preferential tariffs and encouraging auctions to lower solar prices.

-0.55,"Mumbai: If the much-hyped Unified Payments Interface (UPI) of the National Payments Corp. of India is not working as well as it should, blame the large banks.
				   
				Thats the surmise of the Economic Survey 2017 which studied a huge volume of transactions of the so-called Aadhar-enable payment system and discovered that transactions between customers of different banks failed much more often than those between customers of the same bank. The so-called decline rate (failure rate) was 56% in the case of the former, almost double that of the failure rate in the latter. Aaadhar enabled payment system is a bank led model which allows online interoperable transactions at micro ATMs through the business correspondent of any bank using the Aadhaar authentication.One plausible hypothesis for this differential is that the larger banks are declining transactions involving smaller remitting banks while ensuring that transactions involving themselves are honoured, the survey said. The survey warned that as more entities join the UPI, banks should facilitate interoperability instead of thwarting it. But such problems will need to be addressed, since payments banks, telecommunications companies, and small banks are in the vanguard of financial inclusion. So their access to the UPI platform will be critical for advancing digitalization, especially for the poor, the survey said.The Economic Surveys comment is telling.Digital wallet companies raised concerns about banks blocking transactions to protect their turf. Recently, ICICI Bank blocked transactions on payments app PhonePe, citing security issues and violation of UPI guidelines on inter-operability. State Bank of India also blocked net banking transactions with e-wallet companies, although it allowed customers to top their mobile wallets with debit and credit cards. Principally we have favoured interoperability not just among banks but also among banks and non-banks. The proportion of cash transactions still continue to be high. There is therefore a need to take a long term view for the industry. Anything that comes in the way of being interoperable is not good, said Naveen Surya of the Payments Council of India, a lobby group of digital wallet companies. Ever since the government decision to ban Rs500 and Rs1,000 currency notes on 8 November, it has tried to promote cashless transactions. The biggest beneficiaries of this move have been digital payment firms and wallet operators. According to the latest RBI data, the volume of UPI transactions in January was 3.9 million as against 2 million in December. Value of UPI transactions more than doubled to Rs 15.1 billion during the period Interoperability is an equally important tenet across payment system. This is something that is agreed to by all. We believe that if an entity does not follow the interoperability regime, then we have all our rights to stop that and give them time to become interoperable.

				Bloombergs consensus on the price-to-earnings multiple forecast for FY17 has risen several notches since April on the back of rising earnings estimates. But this is not alarming, given the host of positive developments in the company over the last few months.The management decision pencilled several quarters ago to gradually exit non-core businesses has started unfolding. Last week, it said that it plans to sell about 15% in its subsidiary, L&T Technology Services Ltd. This comes close on the heels of the success of L&T Infotech Ltds initial public offering, another unit where the parent sold about 10%.Indeed, these may be a drop in the ocean; considering the huge cash-flow requirement for its engineering and construction business, it has set the wheel of value-unlocking rolling.That is not all. The company intends to sell some operational road assets, power and ports, which are losing money.A Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd report dated 14th July, echoes the same sentiment, saying, these businesses together total losses of about Rs.1,000 crore, which, once sold, will add at least 2% to its return on equity.But then, selling loss-making businesses is not a cakewalk and could take time.There is a leap of faith on the Street. Investors seem to be buying into the management vision that cash flows from better operations and exit from non-core businesses should significantly reduce working capital from current levels. Note that net working capital had shot up from about 17% of sales to 24% in just three years, due to delays in project execution, customer payments, vendor support and so on. The economic revival should also alleviate these problems over the next 12-24 months.That said, there are concerns still on order inflows and margin trajectory. Order inflows for FY16 shocked the Street, declining 12% from a year ago, unable to meet the managements watered down forecast of flat order inflows. This fiscal, they are likely to grow by 15%. However, a report by Religare Capital Markets Ltd points out that order inflows are likely to be flat over FY15 levels, highlighting the plateauing of order inflows, given the high base and a weak investment cycle. Analysts are also apprehensive that a shift to Indian Accounting Standards norms can hurt margins.The macroeconomic clouds are clearing up, what with rising oil prices, a normal monsoon, along with the governments push on infrastructure. This should accelerate order inflows from the Middle East region, where L&T has a presence, and on home ground, albeit a few quarters later.Until then, a firm focus on executing its existing order book, which is about thrice the current revenue, will hold it in good stead. This is one reason why investors may choose to ignore near-term challenges on project execution and margin weakness.

Shalabh brings in valuable experience in managing a large and complex business and we believe he is rightly equipped to take Olas leasing business to the next level and I look forward to working with him, said Bhavish Aggarwal, co-founder and chief executive at Ola, in a statement.An alumnus of Birla Institute of Technology, Pilani, and INSEAD, Seth worked with ITC Ltd between 1993 and June 2001 before joining SAB Miller India, where he played different roles such as director of supply chain, director of sales and managing director.Ola launched the cab-leasing programme in September 2015. Ola had then said that it, along with financing partners and carmakers, will invest Rs5,000 crore towards this cab-leasing programme over the coming year.Ola bet that the leasing programme will help bring in thousands of new cars on its platform and gain an edge over Uber. The company had partnered with Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Nissan Motor India at the launch. Earlier this month, Ola struck a deal with automaker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd to finance vehicles for more than 40,000 of its drivers by 2018. The alliance is worth Rs2,600 crore.In September 2015, the company appointed Rahul Maroli, a former LeasePlan Corp. NV executive, to build the leasing business.It is important for Ola to grow the leasing programme quickly because the supply of cabs has stagnated since late last year after a two-year surge when the attraction of professional independence and high earnings brought cab drivers in hordes to Ola and rival Uber India.But a slower-than-expected growth of the business has prompted Ola to make changes to its leasing business. Apart from lowering the upfront payment and forgoing commissions, Ola has also increased the lease tenure by six months to 48 months, to keep the drivers on its platform for a longer period. Ola is persuading drivers to sign up with a lower upfront payment for cabs, zero commissions and new car models, Mint reported on 21 September.While Ola has been trying to strengthen its senior leadership team, some of its key hires have resigned in the last one year. For instance, Sundeep Sahni, a former executive at e-commerce firm Lazada Indonesia who was hired as vice-president of new initiatives, and Abhimanyu Rawal, head of Olas luxury car business, quit the company since December.Earlier in 2015, Harsha Kumar, associate vice-president of products, and Rushil Goel, head of the payments business had quit.To be sure, Uber India also runs a leasing programme through its wholly-owned subsidiary Xchange Leasing India Pvt.

They included transactions done through the real time gross settlement (RTGS) system, the national electronic funds transfer (NEFT) system, immediate payment service (IMPS), credit cards, debit cards, UPI, point of sale (PoS) terminals and mobile banking.Indeed, the growing popularity and rapid adoption of digital payment systems, in the face of a shortage of cash and stringent limits on bank withdrawals, may be a silver lining to the demonetisation of Rs500 and Rs1,000 notesan exercise that some critics have slammed as ill-conceived and hastily implemented.To be sure, India has a long way go before it joins the ranks of countries such as Sweden, Finland, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, Singapore, France and the UK where more than 85% of the consumer payment transactions are done digitally.But its a start. Consider this. A day after demonetisation, Ola Money, the digital payment solution offered by ride-hailing company Ola, reported an over 1,500% increase in recharges across the 102 cities of its operation. Oxigen Services India Pvt. Ltd, too, claimed to have broken all its previous records in money uploads and transaction count in the week after the demonetisation.Similarly, the National Payments Corporation of Indiathe umbrella organization for all retail payments systems in Indiaclaimed that in just two days (8-9 November), the use of its domestic card schemeRuPayalmost doubled to around 800,000 transactions a day, compared with a daily average of 400,000 transactions earlier (http://bit.ly/2gdu0bW).One97 Communications Ltd-owned digital payments firm Paytm said on 21 November it had seen more than seven million transactions worth Rs120 crore on that day alone. The company claimed that offline, person-to-merchant transactions had grown to contribute over 65% of transactions. Mobile wallet FreeCharge, too, said it had ramped up its acquisition effort and was targeting signing up one million merchants in the coming 12 months.On 16 January, Paytm said it has received a phenomenal response for new service categories such as hospitals, tolls and petrol pumps, and expects to add more categories in the coming months. According to the company, the new categories are generating six million transactions a month and are expected to overtake mobile recharges (in terms of order volumes) by mid-2017. Over the next few months, Paytm will expand to newer categories such as automobile service stations, school and college hostel cafeterias, dairy outlets, apartment maintenance and traffic challans. The company will convert into a payments banks over the next two months, according to a 4 January Press Trust of India report.In a bid to give the country a digital boost, NPCI said its new electronic toll collection (ETC) system would eventually include other vehicle-related payments such as parking fees, servicing and fuel charges (http://bit.ly/2fIv7xf).It was only in September that NPCI launched a pilot project for Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS) with 26 Bharat Bill Payment Operating Units (BBPOUs). Most banks now offer UPI-enabled apps on Google Play Store. To use a UPI-enabled app, you need an Android smartphone, a bank account and a registered mobile number linked to your bank account (http://bit.ly/2eiNqw1).Digital transactions began booming after e-commerce firms such as Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon, Myntra and Jabong began offering attractive discounts to woo customers. Banks accelerated the efforts with their own mobile wallets, mobile banking apps, and pitches of banking on smartwatches and even social networking sites (http://bit.ly/1fucY4s).The launch of Pockets by ICICI Bank Ltd, Lime by Axis Bank Ltd, PayZapp by HDFC Bank Ltd, SBI Buddy by State Bank of India and Ziggit by IDFC Bank Ltd are cases in point.Large telecom services providers such as Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone India Pvt. Ltd, too, have mobile payments solutionsAirtel Money and Vodafone M-Pesa, respectivelytargeted at their own customer base, largely for mobile recharges and remittances. Idea Money from Idea Cellular Ltd, and Jio-Money by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd are other telco-led payment solutions. Airtel, meanwhile, has also announced the launch of its payments bank.Banking in India is witnessing what Nandan Nilekani calls the WhatsApp moment, threatening to disrupt the banking ecosystem in India as payments move to mobile and lending to algorithms. With the launch of UPI, the country has crossed a significant milestone.Apart from making payments easier, UPI enables micro-credit. This will help the currently underserved small traders and businesses. The visibility into transactions provided by UPI apps enables financial institutions to evaluate the credit worthiness of its users. Instead of assets, credit will be based on transaction flow, and can be issued instantaneously. This will provide more choice for borrowers, especially those who depend on moneylenders and the informal sector for loans, says Venkatesh Hariharan, director of Indian Software Products Industry Round Table (iSPIRT)a think tank.Smartphones and increasing Internet penetration will only help Indias digital cause. Around 90% of all devices will be Internet-enabled by 2017, and the number of Internet users will touch 650 million by 2020 from 300 million in 2015, predicts a 25 July report by Google and Boston Consulting Group (BCG). The report forecasts the size of the digital payments industry in India to touch $500 billion by 2020, contributing 15% to Indias gross domestic product (GDP). It also predicts that the non-cash (including cheques, demand drafts, net-banking, credit/debit cards, mobile wallets and UPI) contribution in the consumer payments segment will double to 40% in the same period.Further, while around 30 billion bills worth $103 billion are generated every year, of which 70% are paid in cash, initiatives such as NPCIs BBPS may give a further impetus to the digitization of bill payments.The number of mobile wallet users is already three times the number of credit cards issued in the country (24 million in 2015-16), according to the Google-BCG report.The smartphone explosion in India is expected to usher in this new era in digital payments over the next few years, according to the Google-BCG report.India currently ranks second in the world with more than one billion mobile subscriptions. Of this, around 240 million consumers use smartphones, and this base is projected to increase to over 520 million by 2020.Smartphone subscriptions in the country will increase fourfold to 810 million by 2021, according to the India edition of the Ericsson Mobility Report released on 7 June.The Google-BCG report also highlights that micro-transactions will form a substantial portion of the industry, with more than 50% of the person-to-merchant transactions expected to be under Rs100. It predicts that the value of remittances and money transfer that will pass through alternative digital payment instruments will double to 30% by 2020. A related BCG study (http://bit.ly/2bc0gLk) in August forecasts that by 2020, about 315 million Indians living in rural areas will be connected to the Internet, compared with 120 million now.Globally, too, the payments landscape is seeing heightened activity across multiple categories, ranging from device manufacturers (Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co.), tech firms (Google, eBay Inc., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd), retailers (Starbucks Corp., Wal-Mart Stores Inc.), telecom companies (Vodafone Group Plc., Orange SA) and start-ups (Square Inc., TransferWise Ltd), according to the Google-BCG report.More disruption is expected as the number of fintech start-ups doubled to 1,000 in approximately five years, with funding growing six times to reach $11 billion in 2015.This hockey-stick growth is due to the axis shifting to the customer, who is today served by a variety of competing business models and methods driving its adoption. The explosion in mobile banking is proof enough of how private banks and, later, PSU (public sector undertaking) banks, too, got their act together and worked with start-up fintech firms to rejig their apps, sites and in-house wallets to keep up with customer expectations, rather than trying and do everything by themselves, or waiting for the regulator to issue diktats, says Probir Roy, co-founder and director of digital payments firm Paymate.Hiccups clearly exist.Indians love their cash. Paper currency facilitates making transactions anonymous, helping conceal activities from the government in a way that might help agents avoid laws, regulations and taxes. This is a big difference from most forms of electronic money that, in principle, can be traced by the government, wrote Kenneth Rogoff, Thomas D. Cabot professor of public policy and professor of economics at Harvard University, in an 11 April 2014 paper.This trend is borne out by the fact that retail payments in India, for instance, are still dominated by cash, with a mere 6-7% of transactions conducted electronically. The rest are in cash or cheque.Uber is primarily a cashless service elsewhere in the world, but more than 50% of Uber trips in India are paid for in cash, according to a 10 November blog by Forrester Inc. analyst Ashutosh Sharma.Sharma points out that in India, merchants are forcing the choice of cash payments on customers because electronic payments eat into their marginsjust like everywhere else in the world.Barriers to a cashless world, concurs the World Economic Forum (WEF), include the fact that some merchants still dont want the infrastructure costs and fees associated with electronic payments; some customers still find cash more convenient; access is an issue for individuals without bank accounts; and fraudsters continue to find opportunities in electronic transactions.Consumers who have tried using digital payments but have now shifted to other modes such as cash, card and online banking say the inconvenience of remembering log-in credentials, insufficient acceptance, possibility of a technical or human mistake during a transaction and frequently running out of balance are the top reasons for lapsing, according to the report by Google and BCG. Hence, expanding merchant acceptance is critical to driving mass adoption by consumers.As of 30 September, the number of PoS devices which accept debit and credit cards as modes of payments at merchant outlets was a mere 1.49 million, according to the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBIs) monthly bulletin. Indians had nearly 730 million debit cards and 27 million credit cards at September end, though it isnt clear, however, how many people have more than one card (http://bit.ly/2gc6sFy). Moreover, most Indians use debit cards to withdraw cash from ATMs.According to Roy, a cashless economy has to have appeal and practicality at the most elementary level for consumers and merchants alike, especially given the plethora of overlapping and competing payment options.There are great apps for mobile banking, money transfer, shop and pay, tap and go, etc., and then there are the old faithful viz. net banking, prepaid cards, IMPS and e-wallets, USSD (unstructured supplementary service data) and UPI. The latter (USSD and UPI), yet to quite reach their WhatsApp moment, saddled as it is by the way banks have implemented, and promoting them vis-a-vis other offerings, lack of a people-friendly branding and a common user interface, explains Roy.Roy cites the example of a food court in a mall where you load your food court plastic card, redeem at food stalls on par and cash out the balance when done.Security is another big concern. According to cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab, while those who have been transacting online are fairly well-versed with the threats one can face while paying online, its the first-time users or new adaptors that need to be educated on the risks they are exposed to.According to Altaf Halde, managing director (South Asia), Kaspersky Lab, while payments through smartphones are very convenient and frees one of the pressures to hold cash, it calls for precautions. One small slip-up can cause one a huge loss. While companies are bound by law to follow guidelines, fraudsters find their way through many security barricades. The only way to safeguard oneself, in such a scenario, is to be vigilant while paying and to keep the mobile protected with a security plan. With these two simple steps, people can ward off almost all financial theft risks. As the current adjustment period makes way for settlement, we are sure that more people, across economic strata, will find digital payments way more convenient and may make it their preferred mode of payment, says Halde.Being an online security firm, Kasperky Lab recommends that users should get themselves a mobile security plan.Moreover, interoperability issues are causing friction between banks and mobile wallet service providers.On 16 January, for instance, Mint reported that ICICI Bank Ltd had blocked transactions on payments app PhonePe in at least the second such instance of a commercial bank trying to protect its turf against non-bank mobile wallet and payment companies.PhonePe is a UPI app.A day later, PhonePes co-founder and chief executive officer Sameer Nigam took to microblogging site Twitter to allege that ICICI was blocking transactions since Friday (http://bit.ly/2jlYhGX).ICICI Bank cited security concerns as its reason for blocking PhonePe. NPCI initially ordered ICICI Bank to rectify the situation. Later, in a U-turn, it said PhonePe is in violation of UPI norms (http://bit.ly/2iT5Q3F)On 4 January, CNBC-TV18 reported that SBI had blocked net-banking transactions with e-wallet firms, although it allowed customers to top up their mobile wallets with debit and credit cards.At the time, SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya said the service was blocked because of security concerns.Roy insists that an open-access platform allows for interoperability for wallets operators, and diverse choice for customers. This will allow banks to have a wider acceptability of popular third-party prepaid cards and wallets, with minimal loading failure rates.Second, it will enable them to, inter alia, inter-operate seamlessly and with minimal friction across a multi-sided base comprising e.wallets, banks and common merchants (same QR code for instance).Third, banks will have to rework service level agreements with their PoS merchants and card networks to ensure a much higher reliability.In conclusion, says Roy, India is too large a country, diverse in its perceptions, behaviours and idiosyncrasies to have a one-size-fits-all strategy for a post-cash world.",2017-01-27,ODcuu2wmWqGWNUY6wHhmmJ,The rapid adoption of digital payment systems is seen as a potential silver lining to the exercise that caused a widespread cash crunch thats only now beginning to ease,01:27,Indias cash conundrum: how ready is India to go cashless?

				Bajaj Finance, its consumer business arm, has increased its contribution to the parents profits and now accounts for about 40% of the total profit of the parent.But Bajaj Finservs profits for the September quarter have grown by 30.5% mainly because of the stellar performance of the general insurance business. Bajaj Allianz General Insurance reported a net profit of Rs173.5 crore, a rise of 30% from a year ago. The insurers gross written premium rose 42% to Rs2,179 crore but its assets under management (AUM) grew by 3% to Rs10,360 crore. Much of the business growth seems to be coming from direct sourcing rather than intermediaries, while the contribution of brokers and individual agents has fallen sharply.However, the life insurance business continues to flounder. Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance saw its net profit decline sequentially and from the year-ago period. The management has stated that the companys profits would begin showing higher growth rate over the next two years.The consumer business through Bajaj Finance continued to show strong AUM growth of more than 30%. For the September quarter, profit rose 46% and as usual vehicle finance and consumer durables contributed the highest to growth.The fact that the lender has reduced loan against property augurs well for an asset quality that is already strong. But on a sequential basis, there seems to be a slowdown in many parts for Bajaj Finance. Given that the insurance business has now fired up, investors would want a clear valuation now more than before. Talks of Allianz parting ways with the Bajaj group for both the life and general insurance business have been doing the rounds for quite some time.

Importantly, there will be a uniform licensing system which will cover all hydrocarbons, i.e. oil, gas, coal bed methane, etc., which should help companies explore all kinds of oil and gas resources under one licence.
				   
				The blocks under the new policy will be awarded through an open-acreage policy, which will enable E&P (exploration and production) companies choose the blocks from the designated area. Also, there is a shift to a revenue-sharing model, which will be easy to administer for the government. The measures announced are positive for the sector and are expected to simplify licensing rules and accordingly boost investments in the sector.Whats in it for investors?One of the key announcements made is allowing pricing and marketing freedom for natural gas produced from difficult terrain. This would be applicable to all discoveries in deep water/ultra-deep water/high temperature/high pressure areas which were yet to commence commercial production as on 1 January 2016 and for all future discoveries in such areas.However, there is a ceiling price, which means that prices will not be totally free. According to analysts, the ceiling price based on new guidelines, starting 1 April works out to $6-6.5 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). Domestic gas prices are at $3.82 per mmBtu currently. That looks attractive but its important to realize that the benefits from this development are not going to be visible in the near future.As Nitin Tiwari, an analyst at Antique Stock Broking Pvt. Ltd, says, the new pricing for production from difficult fields could be beneficial for Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) when its KG-DWN-98/2 starts production. Similarly, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) too could benefit when it starts production from its R-Cluster and satellite fields. However, production from the above mentioned fields may start by FY19 or beyond, which means benefits from the development are accordingly going to accrue in the longer-run, than in near term, points out Tiwari.Secondly, the state of the macro environment and commodity (crude/NG/FO) prices would also be crucial for above mentioned developments as policy itself is not a sufficient condition to facilitate investment, he adds. The government has also said that in case of pending arbitration or litigation pertaining to gas pricing covering such fields, the new rules will be applicable only on the conclusion/withdrawal of such litigation/arbitration. This does not augur well for RIL, which is currently in a legal battle with the government over gas pricing.

-0.92,"London/New York: Millions of internet users lost access to some of the worlds most popular websites on Friday, as hackers hammered servers along the US East Coast with phony traffic until they crashed, then moved westward.
				   
				A global attack on one provider of Domain Name System services, Dyn Inc., took down sites including Twitter, Spotify, Reddit, CNN, Etsy and The New York Times for long stretches of time  from New York to Los Angeles.Kyle York, chief strategy officer of Dyn, said the hackers launched a so-called distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack using tens of millions of malware-infected devices connected to the internet. Speaking during a conference call on Friday afternoon, York said Dyn was actively dealing with a third wave of the attack.By Friday evening, Dyn said it had stopped the hacks. As you can imagine it has been a crazy day, Dyn spokesman Adam Coughlin wrote in an e-mail. At this moment (knock on wood) service has been restored.Security professionals have been anticipating a rise in attacks coming from malware that targets the Internet of Things, a new breed of small gadgets that are connected to the internet. That was after a hacker released software code that powers such malware, called Mirai, several weeks ago.Gillian M. Christensen, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said the agency and the FBI are aware of the incidents and investigating all potential causes.Internet havocDyn first reported site outages relating to the DDoS attack at around 7:10am New York time. The company restored service two hours later but was offline again at around noon, as another attack appeared to be underway, this time affecting the West Coast as well.While DDoS attacks dont steal anything, they create havoc across the internet -- and are on the rise in volume and power.Earlier in the day, Brian Krebs, a well-known journalist covering computer security, wrote that the timing of the attacks corresponded with the release of research conducted by Dyns director of internet analysis. Dyn highlighted potential connections between firms that offer to protect against DDoS attacks, and the hackers who conduct them. Krebss own website faced an extremely large and unusual DDoS attack after he published a story based on the same research, he said.We cant confirm or even speculate on anyones motivation or relation to that research, said Dave Allen, Dyns general counsel.Common warfareWith attacks on the internets Domain Name System, hackers compromise the underlying technology that governs how the web functions, making the hack far more powerful and widespread.The DNS translates website names into the Internet Protocol addresses that computers use to look up and access sites. But it has a design flaw: Sending a routine data request to a DNS server from one computer, the hacker can trick the system into sending a monster file of IP addresses back to the intended target. Multiply that by tens of thousands of computers under the hackers control, and the wall of data that flooded back is enormous. A small server may be capable of handling hundreds of simultaneous requests, but thousands every minute cause overload and ultimately shut down, taking the websites it hosts offline with it.The practice often is employed by groups of hackers. In 2012, a DDoS attack forced offline the websites of Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., U.S. Bancorp and PNC Financial Services Group Inc.A DDoS can be achieved in a number of ways, but commonly involves a distributed network of so-called zombie machines, referred to as botnets. A botnet is formed with computers and other connected devices in homes or offices infected with malicious code which, upon the request of a hacker, can flood a web server with data. One or two machines wouldnt be an issue, but if tens or hundreds of thousands fire such data simultaneously, it can cripple even the most sophisticated web servers.In the case of the Dyn incident, the computers targeted were DNS servers. Without a DNS server, large numbers of websites are inaccessible by users across a country or even the world. In other words, taking away the DNS servers is like taking away all the road signs on a countrys highway system. Single company targetedSo-called authoritative DNS providers like Dyn are notoriously hard to secure. Carl Herberger, vice president for security solutions at Radware, an Israeli-based internet security company, likens authoritative DNS providers to hospitals, which must admit anyone who shows up at the emergency room. Dyn must consider traffic going to a website as initially legitimate. In the event of a DDoS, Dyn must work quickly to sort out the bad traffic from the good, which takes time and resources, and creates outages that ripple across the internet, as was the case Friday.Dave Palmer, director of technology at UK cybersecurity company Darktrace, said the most recent DDoS attacks have been linked to Internet of Things devices, in particular web cams.The joke about the Internet of Things was that you were going to get people hijacking peoples connected fridges to conduct these attacks, but in these recent cases the culprit seems to be webcams, Palmer said. We will probably see, when this is investigated, that it is a botnet of the Internet of Things.To avoid massive outages, companies ramp up their capacity to try to absorb the deluge of traffic and reroute it, often with the help of a major telecommunications carrier or cloud-services provider like Akamai Technologies Inc. and CloudFlare Inc. But the only way to really prevent denial-of-service attacks may be to increase the overall security level of consumers around the world, Palmer said, a task that is getting harder as more and more devices are connected to the Internet.This is exactly what happens when tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of devices are left unprotected, Palmer said.

1.0,"Singapore: What does Cyrus Mistry want? Ever since his summary 24 October dismissal as chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, the spurned executive has demanded a reason for his sacking from the holding company of Indias $103 billion salt-to-software conglomerate.
				   
				At the same time, Mistry, 48, has accused Ratan Tata, the 78-year-old who wrested back control of the group, of everything from a control fetish to governance failures and bad judgment. According to Mistry, Ratan Tatas 2006 purchase of Corus Group Plcs British steel assets, his vanity small-car project as well as the acquisition of pricey hotels have exposed the empire that bears his familys name to an existential threat.Some of this could just be wounded pride, but even if Mistrys allegations have a kernel of truth, what does he gain from trash-talking a group in which his family owns 18.4%? One possible answer is that he mightif he can convince enough outside investors in operating companies to side with himprize open the loosely controlled conglomerate, and pluck out a big reward.Tuesdays shareholder meeting of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, the software business, may have been a practice session in that treasure hunt. Tata Sons 73% stake in TCS was enough for Ratan Tata to get Mistry thrown out as its chairman. But at five other companiesIndian Hotels Co. Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd, Tata Chemicals Ltd and Tata Power Co. Ltdthe founding group owns less than 40%. All of them hold shareholder meetings between 13 December and 26 December to vote on Mistrys fate.Also read: What if other Tata group shareholders vote the same way as those at TCS?In three of them, he will have a formidable backer. Mistrys own core supporters, fired together with him, have no clout. But Nusli Wadia, the scion of one of Indias oldest business families, is a heavyweight. He has spent a combined 90 years on three Tata boards.At Tata Steel, where Wadia is the longest-serving independent director, hes already questioning the validity of the companys brand licensing agreement with Tata Sons, a younger company that received its first royalty payment 91 years after the steelmakers founding. Wadia wants an examination of the agreement.A similar suggestion at Tata Motors, where Wadia has been on the board for 18 years, would be a thinly veiled call for mutiny. The ultimate prize may be Jaguar Land Rover, the crowning glory of Ratan Tatas dealmaking career.Tata Sons boosted its stake in Tata Motors by 1.7% on the day of the TCS vote, and is open to buying more ahead of the 22 December extraordinary general meeting. This must be the Wadia effect. Even at TCS, retail shareholders overwhelmingly voted against Mistrys ouster. If Wadias PR spiel can swing enough of them away from Ratan Tata, the latters control of Jaguar Land Rover might be at risk, provided Mistry can raise money for an open offer to shareholders, a condition on which the market regulator may well insist. And that could split the empire.Also read: Message for Tata Sons in bittersweet victory at TCS EGMOn both sides, theres much high-minded talk about values, and how the other camp was ruining the groups reputation for fair play by cutting ethical corners.

0.12,"New Delhi: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is one of the highly capitalized central banks of the world, and the government can redeploy some of its capital for fund infusion in state-owned banks and setting up a public sector asset reconstruction company (ARC), according to the Economic Survey 2017 that was tabled in the Parliament on Tuesday.
				   
				The key principle that should be observed in this process is that the excess capital in the RBI, including that created by demonetisation, is a balance sheet or wealth gain and not an income gain. Hence, the uses to which this is put should be of a balance sheet nature, said the Economic Survey.ALSO READ | RBI governors appointment impacted Indian market: Economic SurveyObserving that there is no particular reason why this extra capital should be kept with RBI, the survey said it is one of the most highly capitalised central banks in the world. Even at current levels, the RBI is already exceptionally highly capitalised, and so, it would seem to be more productive to redeploy some of this capital in other ways, the survey added. Assuming that RBI returns Rs4 lakh crore of capital to the government, what are the uses to which this capital can be put? It could be used in several good ways...first for recapitalizing the banks and/or recapitalizing a Public Sector Asset Rehabilitation Agency (PARA), it said. Second, for extinguishing debt to demonstrate that the government is serious about a strong public sector fiscal position. It cannot be emphasized enough that any strategy to use the excess capital must be done carefully that in no way undermines or circumvents the relevant laws. It must also be done with the full cooperation of the RBI to ensure that the RBIs independence and credibility are in no way undermined, it said.Economic Survey: Big banks may be declining UPI transactions involving smaller banksTalking about global precedents for governments using the capital in their central banks for their own purposes, the Economic Survey said the US Federal Reserve gave $19 billion from its surplus capital to finance transportation projects in 2015. In 2004, the Bundesbank extinguished its old Deutsche Mark currency and counted it as income in the profit and loss account because it was deemed highly unlikely that these would ever be exchanged for euros, the survey said, pointing to the benefit from the extinguishing of bank notes. Highlighting economic objections to the use of excess capital of the central bank by the government, it said the central bank also faces risks to its balance sheet from interest rate changes. If interest rates increase, value of its government bond holdings will decline, inflicting valuation losses. However, risks from interest rate increases are quantitatively less important for the RBI given the composition of its assets. Moreover, these risks will, in general, be negatively correlated with exchange rate risks, it said.

				Twice over.In Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), a business he will lead until 21 February, Chandra, as he is popularly known, has spent almost 30 years, his entire working life.He started as a software programmer with TCS in 1987 and rose through the ranks to become one of the youngest chief executive officers (CEOs) in Tata group when he was 46 years old in 2009.Now, as he prepares to take over as chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, Chandrasekaran is in effect getting ready to run another marathon.He is 53 and the retirement age for top Tata executives is 70, giving him a potential 17 years at the helm of the $103-billion group that has businesses ranging from salt to steel and tea to telecom.Running a marathon is also a metaphor for running a business, according to Chandrasekaran.You have to decide on the length of the engagement, develop endurance to handle setbacks and increase speed when the competition demands it, Chandrasekaran said in an interview to Runners World magazine in October 2015 (bit.ly/2iFOCtK).You have to perform with your heart and your mind; you will not get lost on the way if you have a good road map; you will get nowhere without discipline. This is what I always tell my employees in speeches, he said.He will start running his new marathon at a time when Tata group is in the midst of a bruising battle with its former chairman, Cyrus Mistry, who was sacked on 24 October in a boardroom putsch, less than four years after he succeeded family scion Ratan Tata.Also read: Tata vs Mistry: NCLT dismisses contempt of court plea filed by Mistry firmsThe feud between Mistry, who has accused the 149-year old business house of a variety of corporate governance violations, and Tata has reached the National Company Law Tribunal, or NCLT, where a long and messy legal battle is looming.The Mistry family is the largest minority shareholder in Tata Sons, the holding company of the group.We are at an inflection point, Chandrasekaran wrote in an emailed statement after his appointment. I am aware that this role comes with huge responsibilities. It will be my endeavour to help progress the group with the ethos, ethics and values that the Tata group has been built on.A Tata Sons spokesperson said the chairman-designate was not available for interviews immediately.Chandrasekaran, we believe will now inspire the entire Tata group to realize its potential acting as leaders in their respective businesses, always in keeping with our value system and ethics and adhering with the practices of the Tata group which have stood it in good stead, the Tata Sons board said in a statement on 12 January while announcing his elevation. The five-member selection committee chose him unanimously, it added.Also read: Tata Sons new chairman has twin obstaclesa family and a conglomerateChandrasekaran would be no stranger to the value systems and the practices that the board is talking about. The man who would have been a farmer joined the company after completing his Masters degree in computer applications from the Regional Engineering College in Trichy, Tamil Nadu. Over time, he has worked in a variety of positions (chief operating officer, executive assistant to S. Ramadorai, the previous CEO), and places (California and Stockholm). In that sense, he is an insider.He is an outsider because he is the first truly professional chairman of the Tata Sons board who is not related to the Tata family.Nowroji Saklatwala, the third chairman of the group, was the nephew of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of Tata group. Cyrus Mistry is the brother-in-law of Noel Tata, half brother of Ratan Tata.This can be interpreted in two ways: Either the Tatas chose a safe option by choosing an insider, or the group took a step forward to regain its tarnished credibility by choosing a non-family memberand one with a proven track recordto lead the firm.Also read: N. Chandrasekaran begins long road to restoring Tata groups imageIndeed, Chandrasekarans first task will be to restore the reputation of the group and the sheen of brand Tata.A day after his ouster, Mistry (in a letter that subsequently found its way into the public domain) said the Tata group was beset with a host of corporate governance issues.The group was staring at a potential $18-billion write-down, he claimed. It persisted with a loss-making project, the Nano small car, because it was an obsession with Ratan Tata; there was undue interference from some of the trustees of the Tata Trusts, which own two-thirds of Tata Sons; some friends and associates of Ratan Tata benefited from Tata group contractsthey all were a part of Mistrys lists of allegations.Subsequently, the listed companies of the Tata group lost 6.1% (till 16 January) of their market capitalization, and regulators began asking questions.The controversy at Tata group is not his (Chandrasekarans) creation. He just needs to ride it out. I think if he can build a reasonably supportive relationship with Cyrus, it will be good for the image of corporate India, said Ganesh Natarajan, vice-chairman at Zensar Technologies Ltd, who has worked with Chandrasekaran at software industry lobby Nasscom.Restoring the reputation is just a start. The fact remains that the Tata group has several underperformers. The so-called legacy hot spots which were named by MistryTata Power Co. Ltds Mundra plant in western Gujarat, Tata Steel Europe, Indian Hotels Co. Ltd, Tata Teleservices Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd passenger vehiclesall are pressure points.For instance, in the four years to fiscal 2016, Tata Steel has taken an impairment charge of at least Rs24,175 crore, most of it attributed to the European assets that it acquired with the 2007 purchase of Corus Group Plc for £6.7 billion (Rs54,000 crore today).In the past fiscal, losses at Coastal Gujarat Power Ltd (CGPL), which houses the Mundra plant, were Rs1,491.86 crore.Looking at data aggregated between 2011 and 2015 and limit the analysis largely to the legacy hot spots, it will show that the capital employed in those companies has risen from Rs1.32 trillion to Rs1.96 trillion A realistic assessment of the fair value of these businesses could potentially result in a write-down over time of Rs1.18 trillion, Mistry pointed out in his letter.But it wont be easy to rejuvenate these businesses. Selling or exiting them wont be a quick option since it will call into question the business wisdom and legacy of group patriarch Ratan Tata.Look at Tata Steel. Corus is a disaster, said T.V. Mohandas Pai, chairman of Manipal Global Education and former board of director at Infosys Ltd. Cyrus tried to change that by selling assets, but they ousted him as they said it was against Tata values, said Pai.Tata values, he said, cannot be based on destruction of shareholders value.Pai terms Chandrasekaran as a go getter who is great at marketing and building relationships, but he is not sure if he will get the much-needed free hand to run Tata Sons.Once he takes charge at Tata Sons, the key issue wont be whether he will be able to do well, but whether he will have operational freedom, he said.This talk of freedom to operate that Pai is talking about goes to the crux of Mistrys accusations.Mistry, in his 25 October letter, said he had been reduced to the position of a lame duck chairman.He accused Tata Trusts and some of the trusteesRatan Tata and Noshir Soonawala, in particularof excessive interference in the running of listed Tata companies.Documents filed by the Mistry family firmsCyrus Investments Pvt. Ltd and Sterling Investments Pvt. Ltdin NCLT alleged mismanagement of Tata Sons and oppression of minority shareholders, cited some examples and called them shadow directors.These charges have been strongly refuted by Tata and Soonawala in affidavits they filed in reply.Also read: Why Natarajan Chandrasekaran is a safe choice for Ratan TataLeaving this issue aside, Chandrasekaran will anyway have to establish a good working relationship with the principal shareholders of Tata Sons, both in terms of navigating the three-tier structure of the groupTata Trusts, Tata Sons and Tata group operating companiesand in meeting their expectations.Already, the trustees have come out with statements highlighting their concerns.The new leadership at Tata Sons should ensure that the overall profitability and income of the group improves, and the dividend payout by Tata Sons to Tata Trusts not only stabilizes but also increases, said V.R. Mehta, a trustee of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, in an interview, a day after Chandrasekarans elevation was announced.The main worry of the trust was the decline in the dividend income of Tata Sons from the operating companies, he said.In a 10 November statement, Tata Sons had pointed out that with the exception of TCS, all 40 other firms (many non-dividend paying) in its portfolio paid dividends that have continuously declined from Rs1,000 crore in 2012-13 to Rs780 crore in 2015-16.It said even the Rs780-crore figure included an interim dividend of Rs100 crore, which would have been normally received in 2016-17. Shriram Subramanian, managing director at InGovern Reearch, a proxy advisory firm, says while Chandrasekarans capabilities are beyond doubt, he needs to ensure that better corporate governance practices prevail in the group, and he is not seen as a yes man to Ratan Tata.Also read: Chandras true test will be shutting down Tatas loss-making businesses: Aswath DamodaranIn TCS at least, Chandrasekaran has proven to be his own man as can be seen from the 2008 reorganization of the software firm into five groups, whose directors began reporting directly to him.But the challenges will be different now, when it comes to dealing with other group CEOs, many of them his peers.To some extent, Chandra will also be constrained by not having the experience of having dealt with huge debt and with bankers, said Subramanian.TCS has been the cash cow of Tata group. It accounts for around 17.5% of the total revenue of the conglomerate. It is the company which spews cash to fund Tata ventures into newer businesses, allowing Tata Sons to act like a private equity investor.Chandrasekarans role so far has been to keep it running smoothly and build on the gains made previously; under him, TCSs market capitalization and revenues grew more than three times. But now, he needs to figure out ways to replicate his success with TCS in unfamiliar businesses.The culture in the IT (information technology) industry is one of youthful exuberance, service orientation, technological innovation and collaborative learningan antithesis to the rough and tough shop-floor realities of old-world industries, wrote Prabal Basu Roy, a Sloan Fellow from the London Business School and a chartered accountant, in a column on 14 January. Therefore, this cultural and skill set mismatch will be a major challengethough charismatic leadership can overcome some of this.But such concerns are brushed aside by Tata insiders.Also read: The many challenges of Natarajan ChandrasekaranIf the group chairman knows everything, it will create over dependence and everyone would look upon him rather than doing it on their own, said K. Santhanakrishnan, non-executive and non-independent director at Tata Global Beverages Ltd. The group needs his soft skills. The hardware already exists in the form of professionally managed boards and professional executive management. His experience in the software industry which has linkages with all the sectors and his wide international exposure and acceptability across, would really help the group.Chandrasekaran takes charge at a time when the group needs a strategic reorientation. With the election of Donald Trump, who has vowed to protect American jobs, as US President and the shift in customers spending patterns from traditional IT services to a digital domain, TCS itself is going to face tough times and may not be able to sustain its dividend track record.At the same time, tough calls have to be made to bring down group debt, which stands at Rs2.25 trillion, and which new businesses to focus on.The reactions I get to my philosophy are heartwarming. No less than a thousand employees responded to my call to run the Mumbai Marathon together, Chandrasekaran said in the Runners World interview.To succeed in his new job and successfully complete the metaphorical marathon he is embarking on, he will need a similar response from the 660,000 employees of Tata group.",2017-01-20,PUT0dMs7Buh2WJTdbafJzM,MintAsia examines the challenges Natarajan Chandrasekaran faces  as he prepares to take the helm at Tata Sons at a time when the group is engaged in an ugly feud with its ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry,01:26,Marathon Man

				Sterling is now down 7.4% against the yuan this year, chiefly because of the 23 June vote to leave the European Union, and has fallen 10.3% against the dollar  and a massive 21% against the yen. That left Cambridge-based ARM, whose stock has risen 17% in pound terms since the referendum, still looking like a good bet.Thats because its a bet on the future, in particular the so-called internet of things. ARM isnt the worlds biggest chip designer, but it has been among the nimblest, shifting into smartphones while the likes of Intel remained more dependent on computers. As smartphone sales slow, ARM is selling licenses for chip designs that can boost computing power in everyday devices ranging from connected beds to farm sensors. ARM also has a tiny debt load of 9.5 million pounds ($12.6 million) at the end of last year.This is SoftBanks biggest deal since the Sprint purchase was announced in 2012, and its being done at a premium of 43%  on the face of it, a massive strain on the Japanese companys total debt of about ¥11.9 trillion ($112.8 billion) at 31 March.SoftBank shares have fallen in the past year as the company reeled from losses at Sprint, and efforts to turn around the US wireless carrier forced the company to sell almost $10 billion of its stake in a much more successful asset, the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, last month.Affordability isnt necessarily a problem for SoftBank. The stock dipped after founder Masayoshi Sons heir apparent Nikesh Arora abruptly stepped down the day before the UK referendum. But last month, the company sold its majority stake in Supercell, the Finnish maker of the popular Clash of Clans game, for $8.6 billion. Proceeds from that deal, and from the Alibaba disposal, should be booked this year.And SoftBank still has almost $60 billion in Alibaba stock, Japanese mobile operations that make money, and 43% of the countrys biggest and most profitable search engine, Yahoo Japan, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Michelle Ma.Crucially, SoftBank also has ¥2.6 trillion in cash, and operates in a country with negative interest rates.ARM isnt cheap: Its trading at 49 times current earnings, compared with Intels 14.4 times. Only much smaller Chinese peers like Zhuhai Orbita Control Engineering, at 145 times earnings, are more expensive.Unlike Sprint, however, which was struggling before SoftBank bought it, ARM looks like a smart investment that the pounds decline made smarter.

Frankfurt is a natural pick for firms fleeing London given a financial ecosystem featuring Deutsche Bank AG, the European Central Bank and BaFin, one of the only regulators with experience overseeing complicated derivatives trading.As for Ireland, its presenting itself as a low-tax, English-speaking location with similar laws and regulations to Britain.ALSO READ: British parliament to start debating Brexit trigger bill on 31 JanuaryAll told, TheCityUK lobby group reckons as many as 35,000 jobs could be relocated.

0.91,"The Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) have prompted an interesting change in the way companies look at their assets. Following the transition to the new norms, companies assets have seen wide-scale revaluation, resulting in significant profit increases for the earlier quarter as companies restate those results as per the new accounting norms to compare them with the latest quarterly results.
				   
				This offers an opportunity to see how much the changes in the accounting standards have affected company financials. Moreover, the revaluation has been done in such a way that it will continue to act as a tailwind for profits in the days ahead.Property, plant and equipment (PP&E) revaluations account for the biggest adjustments to profits under Ind AS. The total immediate profit impact of adjustments to PP&E is already worth at least Rs10,776 crore, according to a Mint analysis of recent results data from 72 large firms (from among BSE 100 companies) conducted in partnership with consulting firm KPMG. All figures compare the September 2015 numbers under the old accounting standards with numbers calculated under the new rules. The total absolute value of profit adjustments made (including upward and downward revisions) was Rs19,500 crore. PP&E adjustments accounted for Rs10,776 crore or 55.26% of the changes. The equivalent adjustment made for the June quarter was a negative adjustment of Rs68.35 crore.Sai Venkateshwaran, partner and head of accounting advisory services at KPMG in India, said some companies that had written down their assets in the September 2015 quarter under the old accounting norms have revalued these assets to their fair values on transition to Ind AS. This has led to a reversal of some of the earlier write-downs in the September 2015 quarter, which has improved the profits for that quarter when restated under the new norms.ALSO READ | Transition to  Ind Asconnect the dots to see the real pictureAccording to Venkateshwaran, the new standards allow the fair value of PP&E at the date of transition to be used as its deemed cost. Many companies have used this provision to write down certain assets like plant and equipment to their fair value. On the other hand, several companies have also written up assets such as land to their fair value.The write-down of depreciable assets by some of these companies could have a significant, continuing positive impact on their profits in the days ahead, he said.What do these changes mean on the ground?Consider a firm that had total PP&E worth Rs1 lakh. The land was earlier valued at Rs25,000 and the rest of the factory worth Rs75,000. Suppose that when the company revalues it, a higher value is assigned to the land (say Rs60,000) and a lower amount to the rest (Rs40,000 in our example). The non-land portion sees lower depreciation because of this revaluation. Assigning a higher value to land, and a lower value to other assets increases profits because of this lower depreciation. Land is not depreciated.The result of these adjustments was seen in profit gains when September 2015 results were declared.Integrated oil and gas firms made PP&E adjustments of Rs4,058 crore, according to KPMG data. Firms making iron and steel and intermediate products made similar adjustments of Rs7,091.5 crore (see Chart 1).The iron and steel companies saw their profits more than triple to Rs5,705 crore under the new norms. This makes the sector one of the key gainers profit-wise because of net adjustments under the new norms (Rs3,801 crore). Another gainer is the integrated oil and gas segment, which saw profits rise by Rs2,625 crore to Rs9,345 crore.Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities Ltd, said a number of firms have had to mark down their fixed assetsPP&E against reserves, because the new regulations require these assets to be valued at a level which correctly reflects their remaining useful life. This would have had a negative impact on their net worth, which would have adverse implications for firms carrying high debt.ALSO READ | Profiting from new accounting standardsThese companies probably looked at old value land on their books and revalued it upwards by crediting their reserves to markup their net worth, he said.Independent market analyst Anand Tandon said, The accounting standard allows revaluation, so some of this is inevitable. You have to assume that companies will report as per their convenience.The largest adjustments were made by Tata Steel Ltd. Its profits were revised upwards to the tune of Rs7,463.02 crore because of PP&E adjustments. Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) made PP&E adjustments to its profits worth Rs4,058 crore, according to second-quarter results. (Third-quarter results showed zero such adjustments for the December 2015 numbers).Tata Steel did not respond to email, text and telephonic requests for comment.RIL said it had to revise certain assets downwards to abide by the new regulations. At the same time, it revised its land assets upwards and also the impairment of exploration and production assets because of the change in rules.Land which had been acquired over the decades and held at its historical acquisition cost, has been revalued upwards to reflect its fair value on the balance sheet without causing any impact on reported earnings, said an RIL spokesperson.In case of exploration and production assets, the new norms said they should be accounted for using the successful efforts method instead of using full costs, leading to a reversal in impairment taken, the spokesperson added (see Chart 2).The new accounting standards negatively impacted sectors such as commercial vehicles, and breweries and distilleries too. The latter saw profits erode by Rs854 crore. Commercial vehicle companies saw their losses increase from Rs143 crore to Rs1,589 crore.The reconciliation numbers are based on profits as defined by the company. Some firms may use profit numbers after adjusting for minority interest, others would not. There is no set rule for which profit numbers are used for reconciliation purposes. This is why there is a difference between adjustments by reconciliation numbers and the impact on the more well-tracked profit after tax numbers. The profit after tax number is calculated on a uniform basis across companies.Profits for the 72 companies are up by Rs1,011 crore, or 1.6%, to Rs64,321 crore.This is in spite of Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) dropping 3.72%. The overall Ebitda figure dropped to Rs1.32 trillion on account of the transition to the new accounting standards.Other factors including lower taxes also helped result in higher after-tax profits. This year is the first in which companies are following the new norms.All companies with a net worth of Rs500 crore or more have to abide by the new norms from 1 April 2016. It will apply to those with a net worth of Rs250 crore one year later. Financial institutions such as banks and non-banking financial companies will have to follow Ind AS from 1 April 2018.Whats the big deal? Companies have revised profits upwards citing PP&E (property, plant and equipment) adjustments. The value of these adjustments is already in excess of Rs10,000 crore, shows the latest quarterly comparison. A look into the changes show that they are the outcome of balance-sheet adjustments made after the new accounting standards came into effect. Experts says many companies have had to revise some assets downwards because of stringent new norms.This would have affected net worth of already indebted companies. So, some have chosen to revise land value upwards to preserve net worth, resulting in the changes seen. This in turn is reflected in the latest disclosed financials. An analysis of financials shows that land has been given higher value and other assets are valued lower. This will lower depreciation and increase profit numbers in the days ahead as well.",2017-01-31,PxA2QFXfQ5hkiS9egHPXfM,"Property, plant and equipment revaluations account for the biggest adjustments to profits of 72 large BSE 100 companies under Ind AS, finds a Mint-KPMG analysis",01:31,"The Rs10,000 crore profit adjustment"

				The banks gross non-performing assets (NPAs) more than doubled to Rs32,178.60 crore in the three months ended 30 September from Rs15,857 crore a year ago. Gross NPAs made up 6.82% of the banks loan book, compared to 5.87% in the previous quarter and 3.77% in the year-ago quarter.Total slippages, or new bad loans, during the quarter, including slippages from restructured loan book and watch list of corporate loans, stood at Rs8,000 crore.At the end of the March quarter, the bank had created a watch list of loans worth Rs44,065 crore. These were sub-investment grade loans which were at risk of slipping into the non-performing loans category.More than Rs9,100 crore of these loans turned bad during the first six months of the year and Rs2,461 crore of loans in this category got upgraded during the same period. The watch list of loans now was reduced to Rs32,490 crore at the end of the September quarter.From the two large deals, i.e. the sale of cement plant by Jaypee Prakash Industries and sale of Essar Oil, we expect significant reduction in portfolio over 6-9 months, subject to necessary approvals and subject to transactions getting completed. We have received some amount in October 2016 which are part of the planned repayment arising out of these resolutions, said Chanda Kochhar, managing director and chief executive officer of ICICI Bank, in a call with journalists after the earnings announcement.Kochhar added that the bank continues to focus on reducing exposure to stressed sectors like power, iron and steel, mining, cement and rigs. The total exposure to these sectors decreased from 13% at the end of March to 11.9% at the end of September.As a result of higher slippages, provisions rose 651% from a year ago to Rs7,082.69 crore. This includes Rs3,588 crore of additional provisions made by the bank to strengthen its balance sheet.This is over and above the contingency reserve of Rs3,600 crore that the bank created in the January-March quarter.Despite higher provisions, the bank reported a marginal increase in profit in the July-September quarter, owing to the gains made from the sale of ICICI Bank shares in its life insurance arm.The banks net profit in the second quarter rose to Rs3,102.27 crore from Rs3,030.11 crore reported a year ago. A Bloomberg poll of 19 analysts had expected the bank to post a net profit of Rs2,467.7 crore.The bank reported its results after stock markets closed on Monday. ICICI Bank shares ended at Rs278.75 on the BSE, up 3.4% from its previous close.The banks other income rose three-fold to Rs9,120 crore, including a gain of Rs5,682 crore from sale of its 12.63% stake in ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd through the IPO. Net interest income, or the difference between interest earned on loans and that spent on deposits, however, remained flat at Rs5,253 crore this quarter.The fact that slippages from the regular loan book had been contained was a positive sign, said Siddharth Purohit, senior banking analyst, Angel Broking Ltd.Going by the current quarter, it seems the bank will largely be able to clean up the book and start looking at regular growth from H2 FY18, Purohit said.",2016-11-07,Q4vgiKKxVu55VZZ5WLOx3L,"ICICI Banks  gross non-performing assets (NPAs) more than doubled to Rs32,178.60 crore in the second quarter",16:55,ICICI Bank Q2 net profit crimped by rising bad loans
0.62,"More movies, from more genres have done well in recent months and the big winners, as a result, are multiplex firms PVR Ltd and Inox Leisure Ltd. The companies also have the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) to look forward to. Not surprisingly, shares of both companies have outperformed the Sensex so far this fiscal year. The PVR stock has gone up 63% and that of Inox Leisure by 35%.
				   
				PVR will benefit with around 4-5% Ebitda margin expansion, if GST rate is at 18% while Inox Leisure will benefit with an approximately 2-4% Ebitda margin expansion, pointed out analysts from Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and is a measure of operating profit. For the June quarter, even though both companies saw decent consolidated revenue growth, profit declined a bit primarily on account of muted operating performance. Advertising revenue growth was slower than expected. PVRs advertising revenue increased 13%, slower than in the previous two quarters. This was mainly on account of an increase in the share of regional (Sairat) and Hollywood-dubbed (Jungle Book) movies during the quarter, explains Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd in its post-results update. Regional and dubbed Hollywood movies attract lower advertising rates compared with Bollywood movies. During the June quarter, a higher proportion of box-office collections came from Marathi movie Sairat and the dubbed Jungle Book. Inox Leisures advertising revenue increased by a low 3%. Thats because after ad rates increased in December 2015, markets have not yet adjusted. The fall in occupancy rates was compensated to some extent by an increase in average ticket prices for both companies. PVRs operating profit increased 5.4% year-on-year to Rs.117 crore while that of Inox Leisure declined 3.8% to Rs.62 crore. Both companies saw a decline in operating profit margin compared with last years June quarter. Despite higher other income and decline in finance costs, PVRs reported profit after tax declined 1.7% to Rs.43 crore. PVRs tax outgo was substantially higher. Inox Leisures net profit declined 1.3% to Rs.25 crore.Inox Leisure added five screens in the June quarter and intends to add another 54 screens for FY17 taking the total screen count to 479. PVR expects to take total screens beyond 600 (including DT Cinemas screens) in FY17, informs Motilal Oswal.The content pipeline remains healthy this quarter. Movies such as Jason Bourne, Suicide Squad, Mohenjo Daro and Rustom are expected to do well. Moreover, new screen additions will add to revenues. The only hitch is that investors seem to be factoring in most of the good news.

0.41,"New Delhi: Ajay Kanwal, chief executive, Asean and South Asia, at Standard Chartered Bank, is optimistic about the banks business prospects in India and plans to increase its investment and manpower in its local operations. Kanwal, who is in India as part of the Singapore business forum visiting the country along with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, spoke about Indias investment climate, the ease of doing business and the impact of new tax measures like goods and services tax (GST) and general anti-avoidance rules (GAAR). Edited excerpts from an interview:
				   
				Are investors looking favourably at India?There are external reasons and internal reasons that are working in Indias favour. The external reason is that one of the big destinations for most investments was China. That has tapered off. The alternatives emerging are Indonesia, India and Vietnam.Internally, India has really changed the image. It seems like the best time to come in. It is a function of many things. Led by the PM, India has changed its image as a more engaging country. That makes a lot of change in perception and perception is reality. Second, the laws and regulations are changing. Third, the GDP (growing) at 7.5%. There is a  push and a pull factor that is working in Indias favour.Have things really changed on the ground besides the perception? Is it easier for businesses to operate in India?India has moved up the ease of doing business index, but we are still low in the rankings. We have not reached the point where we are realizing our potential. Things are changing, but they are not enough. States are competing among themselves. Some regulations have eased out, but there are many regulations that people are getting more anxious about. For instance, in taxation, implementation of GST and GAAR, there is still a lot of need for clarity.Instead of making ease of doing business in India our main objective, we should make ease of doing business in 10 cities in India the main aim. India is making progress. Is it fast enough? No. But is it strong enough? Yes. GST, bankruptcy code are not small tinkerings. They are big changes. The key will be implementation.Has the bank achieved the rebalancing it was striving towards in its India operations?We do believe India will grow. By the time the year ends, we would have added 1,000 people into our India business. These are typically in the consumer business and some of this in commercial business.Our corporate bank in India was always large. Our corporate book has grown in the first half of the year.Rebalancing will take time, but we have already begun the journey. It does not happen in a year; its a multi-year journey. We are investing in India.The advantage we have is our network banking across geographies. We cannot be a large-scale local lender because we do not have the distribution to be one.Does the lack of a distribution network hamper your plans of focusing more on retail?Digital banking is a huge opportunity for any retail bank. This whole belief that we are restricted by distribution is still true, but less true. Our own belief is that why do we exist in retail in India is to make sure that we bring the best we do in the world to India. There are things we do very well and things we dont do very well. Wealth management, for instance, is something we do very well, we have a decent card business and mortgage financing. We are not in car finance anymore because we dont do that very well.How much do you plan to invest in India?We plan to invest $100 million in India over the next five years.Have you managed to address the large concentrated corporate exposure at the bank?There is $20 billion of risk weighted assetsthose outside our risk tolerance levelthat we planned to address over a period of time. That gave the rest of the bank clarity on the growth areas.Having said that, has the world economic environment become much better than what it was a few years ago? I do not think so. Interest rates are still very low. There is volatility in the market and the commodity cycle is challenged. We have identified the issues and are addressing them. The corporate book will become more broad-based.How does Indias tensions with Pakistan impact your plans?Geopolitics being a factor of consideration for any business is real. Right now, its (tensions between India and Pakistan) very fresh. It has not changed our thinking (about India) as of now. And I am hoping that it doesnt change our thinking as we go along. Right now, India is on a good growth path. Its certainly a challenge that we have to think abouthow India addresses itand then we take it from there.",2016-10-04,QQIPDL6FGRotYq9nBR0uaL,"Ajay Kanwal, chief executive, Asean and South Asia, at Standard Chartered Bank, plans to increase the banks investment and manpower in its local operations",00:33,GST and bankruptcy code are big changes: Ajay Kanwal
-0.31,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday eased the rules for various stressed asset resolution schemes and expanded the scope of a loan recast plan previously limited to the infrastructure sector.
				   
				RBI also streamlined the process for change of ownership of stressed assets outside of the so-called strategic debt restructuring (SDR) process, which allowed creditors to convert debt into equity and take over the management of defaulting companies.Under its latest loan resolution plan, the scheme for sustainable structuring of stressed assets (S4A), RBI has allowed banks to classify at least half the debt involved as a standard assets.Under S4A guidelines, first announced in June, banks were allowed to split the funded liabilities of a stressed company into sustainable and unsustainable debt. The sustainable debt would be left alone to perform or be restructured if necessary, while the unsustainable debt would be converted into equity or equity-like, long-dated securities and redeemed at a later date.The revised norms say in case a non-performing asset (NPA) is restructured under S4A norms, the sustainable part of the debt can be classified as standard if banks set aside provisions equal to at least 50% of the debt classified as unsustainable or 20% of aggregate debt, whichever his higher.For this purpose, the provisions already held in the account can be reckoned, RBI guidelines said. When these norms were introduced in June,  if the account was an NPA on the reference date, banks were asked to classify both halves as an NPA even when S4A restructuring was under process. In case the account is standard when it goes into S4A, the entire outstanding debt will remain standard, subject to provisions made upfront by the lenders being at least 40% of the unsustainable amount or 20% of the aggregate outstanding, whichever is higher.Since standard assets require lower provisions, this would require banks to set a smaller amount aside.RBI also said the unsustainable part of debt in any S4Awhether the account was NPA or standard at the time of restructuringcould be upgraded to standard, if the sustainable half of the debt performed satisfactorily for one year. Banks would also be allowed to reverse all provisions made when the unsustainable half of the debt is upgraded. However, in all cases, the required mark-to-market provisions on instruments after conversion of unsustainable debt must be maintained at all times.In the so-called 5/25 scheme, which allowed loan payments to be stretched out, RBI has increased the coverage to all sectors. It has also allowed smaller projectswhere banks have at least Rs250 crore exposureto qualify for this scheme.Not all rules have been eased. In SDR, RBI said banks cannot book income after 90 days of invoking the scheme even though they continue to classify the asset as standard.In cases where banks have decided to change ownership in a firm outside SDR norms, deadlines were set for these changes. According to RBI, the conversion of debt into equity  should be completed in  90 days from date of approval by a lending consortium or the joint lender forum. In case  a pledge of equity shares is invoked, it has set a deadline of 180 days.

				Richard Usher, formerly of JPMorgan Chase & Co., Rohan Ramchandani, who used to work for Citigroup Inc., and Chris Ashton, a former Barclays Plc trader, were indicted Tuesday on conspiracy charges in New York. Theyre all living in the UK and will have to be extradited unless they surrender voluntarily.The three men used an online chatroom they dubbed The Cartel to coordinate trading of US dollars and euros and manipulate prices of the currencies, according to the indictment. They are charged with conspiring to restrain trade from the end of 2007 through the beginning of 2013. The goal of the conspiracy was to suppress and eliminate competition in the trading of the euro and the dollar in the US, UK and Switzerland, according to the charges.The case represents the culmination of the governments promise to prosecute individuals at the center of one of the biggest market-manipulation investigations of the Obama administration. The indictments come after years of criticism against the Justice Department for securing multibillion-dollar corporate penalties without holding individuals to account.ALSO READ: SoftBank hires UK investor Akshay Naheta to help manage $100 billion fundNo one gets a free pass simply because they were working for a corporation, said deputy attorney general Sally Yates, the departments No. 2 official. Todays indictment reiterates our commitment to holding individuals accountable for corporate misconduct.Lawyers fire backLawyers for the traders criticized the US for moving forward with its case after UK authorities looked at the same evidence and decided not to bring charges.

Usher and Ramchandani started conspiring in December 2007, while Ashton got involved four years later, according to the indictment.The three former traders participated in telephone calls and electronic messages, including engaging in near-daily conversations in the chat room, which they also referred to as The Mafia, where they discussed past, current and future customer orders and trades, prosecutors alleged.The CartelThe Cartel chat room was started by Usher as early as 2009, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.

0.25,"The juggernaut of digital advertising continues to roll ahead, undeterred by sceptics and naysayers who are questioning if brands have already over-invested in the medium. As we cross the chasm of adoption and enter the eye of the tornado, 2017 will provide the perfect space and time for a little reflection. 
				   
				The story of six blind people describing an elephant has an interesting parallel in the world of digital advertising. We have been deluged by techno-babble around search, social, video, mobile, native and programmaticthrow in a couple more in the room and now you have programmable (distinct from programmatic) and AI (artificial intelligence) to add on to the ever-growing list of stuff that makes up digital advertising. First, some numbers to set the context. Digital advertising in India is forecast to breach the $1 billion milestone in 2016-17. There is a lot of headroom for growth, when you look at the rapidly growing smartphone consumer base over the next five yearsprojected to rise 4x, up to 820 million. A more compelling indicator for digital spends that can ride this wave is the uptick in data consumption; climbing up at a compounded annual growth rate of 30% and projected to reach 7GB/month (per active user) by 2021 (according to the Ericsson Mobility Report of 2016). So why does digital ad spending in India still stand at just 15% of the total advertising pie, unlike the over 40% share in evolved markets? Where does the problem lie? I believe that the advertising model for digital in India is fundamentally broken. Very little responsible action has been taken by publishers and media agencies and to some extent even clients, rendering a large part of such a potent medium ineffective. Digital advertising is all about effectivenessand we all grew up to understand this is the only medium that has the power to deliver the relevant signals from consumers. And yet, in the limited buying exercises we conducted in 2016, we saw publishers turning a blind eye to traffic quality and relevance of audience profile. Unfathomable performance metrics and targeting parameters are spun out as yarns; many clients fall hook, line and sinker for these. Search will continue to reign over display despite its limitations to deliver scale. For categories that score high on digital influence (consumers researching online) and digital density (consumers buying online), measuring intent is keyand search will be simply unbeatable in capturing intent-laden traffic emanating on the horizontal screen. Content will be the game changer in categories that are digital emergent and score low on both influence and density. Brands that will consistently invest in content will have more success in influencing the influencers. A leading few will be able to articulate a vision leveraging such content for communities and launch their brand-as-a-service to fulfil some need gaps.Mobile is the tricky part to understand. While time spent on the vertical screen is witnessing an inexorable rise, the platform choice is influenced by content, and behaviour is heavily skewed to messaging, social, entertainment and news. Time spent using the mobile browser is more than native apps in developing economies, and India is no exception as local research suggests. Advertising choices on the mobile are thus far more compelling yet terribly complex. Native advertising makes the best sense of all available options backing search, especially for brands investing heavily in content. Forecasts that indicate this format reaching 75% (of total display advertising) in mature markets like the US, make complete sense as of now. But where does native work bestsocial, in-publisher feed, or sponsored content? It is a tough question that can best be answered by the format of advertising you choose.Videos have a really, really bad track record on social, and Facebook has been struggling to revise recommended metrics of meaningful video consumption. Certainly, Facebook scores over any other platform in its innate ability to spread content, but when it comes to video, the numbers have to be taken with a pinch of salt. In fact, for advertising content (including brand story telling) delivered via video, I have found YouTube to return far more tangible value. Shares are a great number to flaunt on social, but barring the outliers, the effectiveness of advertising views is extremely poor when you have little control on how your content spreads. Not everyone who shares your video actually watches it completely. What needs fixing in 2017?We need clarity on what large publishers are throwing at our face in terms of targetingwhether it is audience in-market or audience insights. We accept many such publisher definitions at face value, and there is no vehicle for grievance redress when the performances dont match up to the promise. Viewable impressions (and related discussions on ad fraud) have just started being addressed with new technologies, and this needs strong push in the coming years. What needs terribly urgent fixing, and nearer home, is blatant corruption by some publishers who outsource traffic generation to farms (both human and bots), and media agencies that hand-in-glove push bulk-buys from such publishers. Clients have to take a fair share of responsibility for landing the industry in this mess because they refuse to pay the required service fees to an agency to run digital media with brains. The bulk buying metrics that work for mainline media are applied to digital by old-school media buyers; and at 3% commissions with no accountability on performance, everyone just ends up pulling a fast one on each other.At the end of the day, it is simple for you to examine traffic quality, to arrive at your own conclusions about who is clean and who is tainted. Which platform was more effective for completed videos views? Did the high number of shares on your contagious content reach the targeted audience? What percentage of the traffic on your website disappeared under 10 seconds? You have to start asking the hard questions and stand up to your management and speak the brutal truth.Takeaways for 2017 Experiment always: There has never been a better time to experiment with formats and newer platforms. With emergence of 360 degree video and Live (broadcast live like Twitter with Periscope, Facebook Live etc.), the possibility of creative in-feed advertising content has taken a leap forward. Splurge some money on interactive content advertising and learn from the engagement data.Approach hype with cautious optimism: The dynamics of digital introduces new technology every year that in turn triggers hype cycles. You can choose to skip some, like Dynamic Creative Optimization or VR (Virtual Reality is certainly the next big thing in content). Adobe has demonstrated use of technology to change subject lines of e-mailers to counter ad-fatigue, and I am a big believer in dynamic emailers that compose content on the flyso maybe that is something worth pursuing if you are big on triggered e-mailersstuff that dominates early part of your relationship with a subscriber (before fatigue sets in).Invest in dashboard technology: Measure your key performance indicators. You will need a bespoke dashboard using smart widgets that track share of search, product sentiment, audience recency/loyalty and purchase intent, etc. You must track social presence and advertising effectiveness. Conduct an interaction health check. Most importantly, split the management view (input vs. output) from the practitioners, so you can demonstrate return on investment. Wire up your assets: For those who have reached a mature state of digital marketing running multiple brand assets (web, social, apps), 2017 will be time to wire them up using consumer-profiling technology. A mature digital business needs to know consumers better to be able to deliver smarter advertising. Capturing the state of mind of your audience is a crucial departure you can make with programmable advertising. Understand digital for offline: Connecting online advertising with offline sales is the next holy grail of accountability and few publishers are doing pioneering work in the area. Experiment with advertising that supports the consumer decision journey (ROPOresearch online, purchase offline) instead of banal re-targeting.Focus on quality: Stop spending money in the wrong places. Find the right partner to support your vision and make sure you work out a compensation structure that incentivizes your partner to deliver quality.

				The multiplex firm announced last week that it closed the DT Cinemas deal. Under the revised terms, PVR will now add 32 screens with the acquisition, compared with the earlier estimate of 39 screens. Nonetheless, the deal closure is good news.The DT Cinemas acquisition and its organic screen addition will help PVR clock 608 and 664 screens in financial year 2017 (FY17) and financial year 2018 (FY18), respectively, according to ICICI Securities Ltd.It is expected to report ATPs (average ticket prices) of Rs.207 and Rs.218 in FY17E and FY18E, respectively, wrote analysts from ICICI Securities in a note on 31 May.The report further added that major growth in ATPs would stem from DT Cinemas screens, which operate at a superior ATP i.e. at ~15-20% premium to that of PVR. At March end, PVR had 516 screens.On the other hand, Inox Leisure Ltd plans to add 89 new screens for financial year 2017, leading to 509 screens by the year end.PVRs ATP during the past quarter had increased 8.3% from a year earlier to Rs.182, while that of Inox rose by 5.7% to Rs.167.While both the companies fared well in the seasonally weak March quarter and posted good growth in operating profit, PVRs performance was better.Further, PVRs advertising revenue growth at 19.3% looks far superior to the 2% decline in advertising revenue that Inox reported. A delay in the absorption of advertising rate hikes has taken a toll on Inoxs advertising revenue lately. Even as both the companies reported an operating profit, higher depreciation costs and finance expenses led them to post pre-tax losses.Still, the year as a whole proved to be rather good, what with movies such as Baahubali-The Beginning, Bajrangi Bhaijaan, Tanu Weds Manu Returns, Avengers, Piku, etc. performing well at the box office.The upshot: PVRs pre-tax and exceptional item profit increased to Rs.149 crore for financial year 2016 from Rs.14.6 crore for financial year 2015, a somewhat dull year for cinema performance.Similarly, the measure for Inox increased to Rs.89.5 crore from Rs.16.5 crore.What about the current financial year?Well, the year has begun well with the success of The Jungle Book and the content pipeline is looking strong.But will this year be better than the last? The answer to that will drive the fate of these stocks, which have outperformed the benchmark Sensex in the past year.

-0.24,"Mumbai: Shareholders of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, the first among the listed Tata group companies, will meet on Tuesday to decide the fate of the six-week-long Tata Mistry battle that has rocked Indias biggest conglomerate. Shareholders of Tata Industries Ltd on Monday removed Cyrus Mistry as director.
				   
				While the EGMs, to some extent, will end the indecisiveness facing the listed entities, its unlikely to bring the curtain down any time soon on one of the biggest corporate feuds seen in the recent past. If anything its going to be protracted battle with both sides likely to seek legal recourse and seeking intervention from market regulator and the government.Here is a quick analysis of the possible scenarios that are likely to emerge:If Tata Sons wins...Mistry gets removed as the director from the boards of various companies. He will also cease to be the chairman at firms where he continues to hold the position. Tata has ousted Mistry as chairman of Tata Consultancy Services, Tata Global Beverages Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd. He continues to be the chairman of Tata Motors Ltd, Tata Chemicals Ltd, Tata Power Co. Ltd and Indian Hotel and Co Ltd. However, Mistrys ejection from the board of Tata companies may not warrant peace to Tatas, said legal experts. Being a shareholder (18.5%) in Tata Sons he can continue to fight. Even if he is ousted, he has the right to arouse his grievances as he has been in the management and is also a shareholder, said a corporate lawyer who declined to be identified. Also read: Tata: 1, Mistry: 0, but this fight has just begunAlso, shareholders who believe Mistry has been wronged can approach the market regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India or Sebi, and the government to intervene and probe for insider trading, disclosure norms and financial discipline.If Mistry wins...He continues to be a director on the boards of all the operating companies. Tata Sons will have no option left but to take the legal recourse to remove him from the board of companies. Such a scenario may lead to a divided board which is not in the interest of the larger stakeholders of the company, said Kavil Ramachandran, executive director, Thomas Schmidheiny Centre for Family Enterprise, Indian School of Business. A divided board is not good for any organization, he said pointing out that it will also have an adverse impact on the plans and decisions taken by the board. Amit Tandon managing director at IiAS, a proxy firm, agreed. It will bring unwanted disruptions on the board, said Tandon.Also read: Nusli Wadia alleges lapses in corporate governance at Tata Sons, Tata TrustsA defeat in the EGM may prompt Tata Sons to seek intervention from the market regulator and the government as they would want to be vindicated and prove their they were right in their allegations, said the lawyer cited above.

While IiAss Tandon believes the current crisis is an opportunity for the group to fix its structural issues not every one agrees.

-0.3,"New Delhi: The dispute between the government and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) over the latters alleged production of gas from a Krishna Godavari basin reservoir it shares with state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) seems headed for a protracted battle. The oil ministry has asked for views from Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), the law ministry and in-house legal experts on whether it should proceed to recover the $1.55 billion compensation demanded from RIL while an arbitration remains pending.
				   
				The oil ministry has also sought their views on the measures that could be taken to ensure that production of gas does not decline further from RILs KG D6 block so that any move to recover the compensation from the sales revenue of gas from the KG DWN 98/3 (KG D6) block does not suffer, a person with direct knowledge of the development said on condition of anonymity. RIL reported production of 139.1 billion cubic feet of gas from the block in 2015-16.An email sent to RIL on Tuesday remained unanswered at the time of going to press.The person quoted above said that the government was merely addressing all aspects of the dispute as per the law and was not being vengeful to an investor. We are only taking steps to protect governments revenue interest in an objective manner as any government of the day will do in any given dispute. The provisions of the law will take its course, said the person.After the oil ministry raised the compensation claim on 4 November, Reliance proposed an arbitration to resolve the issue. Accordingly, the government nominated G.S. Singhvi, a former Supreme Court judge and former Competition Appellate Tribunal (Compat) chairman, as its arbitrator, Mint reported on 26 December. Singhvi, along with RILs nominee on the arbitration panel, Bernard Eder, a former high court judge in the UK, are now in the process of finalizing a third neutral umpire arbitrator for the panel.The ministry raised the compensation demand after the Justice A.P. Shah panel, which looked into ONGCs claim of gas flow between the neighbouring fields of the two companies, recommended on 31 August that RIL should compensate for the unfair enrichment it had by way of retaining the gains of gas flow into its block KG D6. The panel was appointed after the Delhi high court, on a petition from ONGC, asked the government to resolve the issue in a transparent way, keeping in mind provisions of the law and applying principles of natural justice.The panel, which lacked technical expertise on determining whether gas flowed from ONGCs block to RILs, relied upon a report by consultant DeGolyer and MacNaughton, jointly hired by the companies, to say that between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2015, about 11 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas migrated to KG D6 from adjacent fields, of which RIL benefited from 8.9 bcm. RIL in a 4 November statement said that its liability to pay compensation had not been established by any process known to law. The claim of the government is based on misreading and misinterpretation of key elements of the production sharing contract and is without precedent in the oil and gas industry, anywhere in the world RIL remains convinced of being able to fully justify and vindicate its position that the governments claim is not sustainable, the company had said then. Experts said disputes often arise on account of volatility in the energy sector as well as from multiple interpretations of the contract.The government has to ensure that investors get a reasonable return on their investments in the oil and gas sector compared to what they would get from other markets or from other industries.

-0.24,"With ease of doing business for customers becoming the new mantra for Indias state-owned ports, its not surprising to see container terminal operators, even if they are run by private firms at these ports, coming up with new initiatives to score brownie points.
				   
				Gateway Terminals India Pvt. Ltd, 74% owned by APM Terminals Management BV, the container terminal operating unit of Danish shipping and oil giant AP Moller Maersk Group A/S, has introduced what it calls continuous gate-in facility for exporters, a first in India.Gateway Terminals is the biggest of the four container terminals operating at Jawaharlal Nehru (JN) Port, Indias busiest container gateway.To put it simply, the new initiative means exporters can deliver containers at the terminal for the next shipping cycle, even when there is an existing vessel docked at the terminal for the current cycle. Other terminals close their gate-in services for the next shipping cycle for about 24-36 hours when a ship is docked till the loading and unloading process is complete for that vessel.Shipping cycles are weekly. Terminals allow container cargo for the current shipping cycle to be delivered till a particular cut-off time. Once the unloading and loading process is completed for a docked ship and only upon the vessel sailing is the gate-in facility opened for the next vessel/shipping cycle. Considering 80% of the cargo delivered still comes by road (70% of which are up-country cargo containers from the northern hinterland), this facility of continuous gate-in obviates the necessity for trucks having to park outside the terminal on the approach road, awaiting the opening of the gates for the next vessel, thus preventing congestion and reducing costs for the trade.The continuous gate-in service, according to Gateway Terminals, negates indirect costs and reduces congestion due to container-laden trucks clogging the approach roads to the port for gate opening, a common sight at JN Port for long.It takes about 378 hours and $695 for importing a cargo container through Jawaharlal Nehru Port, according to the Doing Business Report 2016 published by the World Bank.The time and cost involved in an import shipment are 115 hours and $214 on account of customs, 196 hours and $342 on port and border handling and 67 hours and $139 on document preparation.Port and border handling on the import side includes the time spent by the cargo container at container freight stations (CFS) located outside the port area which takes nearly 8-9 days at JN Port. On the import side, the average time taken in the port per se is around 36 hours at JN Port, according to the port authority.Similarly, on the cost for port and border handling which is indicated as $342, the cost for handling within JN Port is only around $60, while the remaining cost is related to CFS and other logistics activities.Exporting a cargo container through JN Port entails 149 hours and $472, according to the World Bank report. This includes 37 hours and $170 at customs, 51 hours and $198 on port and border handling and 61 hours and $104 on documentation.One of the major issues on the exports side at JN Port is the waiting time for trucks before entry into individual terminals.The reasons attributed for the long wait are that many trucks which carry factory-stuffed containers come well in advance so as not to miss the ship, and add to congestion on the roads.Factory-stuffed containers are mostly routed through CFS but some tractor trailers carrying containers do not go into the CFS and, instead, wait on the roads. At times, terminals even shut down their gates unannounced when a ship is at berth unloading and loading. These unannounced shutdowns lead to congestion at the gates and on the roads.The main reason for bringing containers well in advance to the port area is the anxiety of the exporter to ensure the container does not miss the deadline for entry into the terminal before the ship departs. There is no reliable information for planning container movement.The government has advised JN Port authorities to compress the gate window time from the current five days to four days immediately and to three days over a period of time.The continuous gate-in initiative introduced by Gateway Terminals, though laudable, raises some questions. Does this mean Gateway Terminals will not follow a cut-off time for exporters to deliver their containers at its terminal?If so, wouldnt it render the window concepta term used to describe the time slot given to a ship for docking at a terminalmeaningless.Some two decades ago, trucks carrying containers used to come in any point of time, drop the containers and go off; vessels used to come at any point of time, unload, load and sail off. This led to chaos and resulted in the introduction of the window concept globally.If there is no cut-off time at Gateway Terminals, can an exporter gate-in a container for loading on a ship that is expected, say, in three weeks? Who will pay the storage charges till the container is loaded onto the ship?Gateway Terminals says it is not collecting any extra charges for offering the continuous gate-in facility to customers. On the contrary, it says, customers are saving trucking costsinstead of waiting outside on the road, the containers are taken inside.But, there will be a cost involved in this exercise because the rate regulator for ports such as JN Port allows a free storage time of three days. After that, charges are levied depending on the duration of the stay.These days, there is enough parking space inside the terminal yard due to low volumes. And, empty containers lying in the yard are being taken out quickly because the ground rent for empties is significantly higher than laden ones.So, essentially, the continuous gate-in facility may end up transferring cost from one place (roads) to another place (terminals) unless the terminal operator decides to waive of the storage charges.But then, who would pass up an opportunity to make an extra buck in these difficult times? An exporter will now have to choose whether he prefers his container to stay on the road with the attendant costs or take the container inside the terminal, again with attendant costs. Its a trade-off. P.

The agency has named two bank officials, working at the Kashmere Gate branch in Delhi, Vineet Gupta (branch head) and Shobhit Sinha (operations head) who with active connivance of a private person Rajeev S Kushwaha deposited huge amount of demonetised currency to the tune of Rs40 crore of various firms and companies run by Kushwaha for a huge commission and converted it into monetised form like (real time gross settlement) RTGS transfers and gold.The case was first detected by Delhi Police after it intercepted three persons with about Rs3.7 crore cash in old notes in front of the Axis Bank branch in November last year. The ED took cognisance of the police FIR and slapped money laundering charges against the accused. The trio was arrested by it in December last year under PMLA and are currently in judicial custody. Detailing their modus operandi, the agency said, the trio used to deposit money after banking hours at around 6:00 PM The money deposited in these accounts was transferred to different accounts within minutes to different companies through Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS). HDFC Bank increases cash transaction fees on savings accountsNo suspicious transaction reports (STRs) were filed by the bank officials and the depoits were made without authorisation, bypassing banking formalities. ED said, It all started when following demonetisation (on November 8, 2016) people with illegal money began converting their old currency notes into gold/legal tender. These bullion traders wanted payments in RTGS/transfer of money through banking channel for the sale of gold as old currency was not accepted. Some of such elements contacted Kushwaha and his associates for this purpose. Kushwaha was having various fictitious companies/firms namely Ms Himalaya International, Ms RD Trader and Ms Beagle Marketing and Ms Sunrise Trading. The chargesheet further said: They (Kushwaha and others) contacted Gupta and Sinha to get special facilities to put the old currency into the banking system through their fictitious/shell companies having current account in Kashmere Gate branch by offering huge commission. Kushwaha and his associates collected old currency charging huge commission from various people and infused that money into the banking system and acted against the law. The amount so deposited in these companies account was transferred to various bullion traders for procurement of gold which was given to the person who had given them their illegal money in old currency, it said. The agency had also attached assets belonging to Gupta and others worth Rs3.4 crore. ED probe had also found that huge amount of money was transferred through RTGS to some shell companies including in a case where the Director of a firm was a petty labourer living in a slum in Anna Nagar jhuggi camp in the national capital. It was also found that directors of other shell companies were also persons of no means, the ED had said earlier.",2017-02-03,RvtmwWTchcn27Lxe4mMKJP,The agency filed the chargesheet against the Axis Bank staff  before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act court ,21:11,Note ban: ED files 1st money laundering chargesheet against Axis Bank staff

0.64,"Singapore: The Indian start-up ecosystem is quite fragmented, and has a lot of players in the business-to-consumer space (B2C) space, but it requires a lot more focus on business-to-business (B2B), said Nipun Mehrotra, vice-president, growth initiatives, IBM India & south Asia. There have been some big exits in the consumer segment with the likes of Myntra, Jabong and Freecharge etc and with more and more international brands venturing in to the Indian market the consumer start-up industry will witness further churn and consolidation.

				Edited excerpts: This year is shaping up to be perhaps the roughest ever for Indias technology companies. How do you think Indian start-up ecosystem should prepare themselves going forward?The startp-up ecosystem in India is evolving and as per the latest report by Nasscom- ZINNOV, India will be home to 10,500 start-ups by 2020. However, there is still a long way to go for the start-ups. On one hand, the start-ups need to come up with very deeply differentiated business models which will add value to their customers, and at the same time make their processes efficient and frugal - for example, leverage existing API (application programming interface) s as much as possible to build products rather than developing products from scratch. They need to make their investments work twice as hard to build their business in 2017 and beyond. Another example of things that can help is to be very user focused when they build their business vs being product feature-focused. Alignment to the end user is critical at an early stage and start-ups must embed design thinking aspect as they build their product.When it comes to global ecosystems, London is the first thing on ones mind when you talk fintech. What do you think of the fintech opportunity in India?The fintech industry has gained momentum in India since the beginning of 2015. The industry witnessed the emergence of numerous fintech start-ups, incubators, and investments from public and private investors. The key enablers in the industry like government policies, regulatory framework coupled with various banks like ICICI and AXIS coming up with their accelerators to work along with entrepreneurs has helped to drive the momentum in India. The fintech start-ups are further leveraging various government initiatives like Jan Dhan Yojna, Aadhaar, and Digital India and we will see a lot of innovation happening in this space in the coming years. While there is a lot of growth opportunity for this sector, the companies also need to look at greater collaboration between various players and amalgamate learnings and entrepreneurial experiences for further growth of this sector. There should also be a cohesive fintech environment built for complete infrastructure penetration. We are witnessing some innovation in the P2P (peer-to-peer) lending, robo advisory, bank-in-a-box, security and biometrics areas which are treading fast towards mass market implementation, with technology like blockchain just marking its entry with a promising future for the fintech companies.What is your take on Indian governments approach to the start-up ecosystem in India?The government has launched many progressive programs to address the requirements of the start-up ecosystem in India. (With) Start Up India, along with programmes like Make in India, the government is giving a further boost to the start-up community. Government is also focusing on making start-ups leverage new age technologies and has set up National Initiative for Development and Harnessing Innovations (NIDHI), an umbrella programme which aims to nurture ideas and innovations in the start-up ecosystem. ...friendly policies like waiving income tax on their profit for the first three years, a simple exit policy, fast tracking of the patent applications, 80% exemption in patent fee, self-certification based compliance system etc are bold move to get more young minds in the start-up space. There can be more work done to support the growth of start-ups in India by driving structured collaboration between government and corporates. We believe that with emergence of new technologies like cognitive, cloud, IoT (Internet of Things), design thinking etc. and governments push for R&D (research and development) the startup ecosystem can transform the innovation culture and place India on a high growth trajectory.Exits are still an issue in India, when do you see them happening?We believe the Indian start-up ecosystem is quite fragmented and while we have a lot of B2C start-ups, we do require more focus on B2B and on start-ups that are differentiated by IP or deep tech. Start-ups also need to focus on building a scalable business, with an international outlook and catering to standards that make them attractive to large global tech companies or global clients. There is a need for uniqueness and use of deep technology to distinguish from B2C models. We believe for exits to ramp up, there needs to be a concerted approach by all players in the ecosystem and to possibly replicate the success that Israelas one examplehas seen. We do see the government being aligned towards helping start-ups not just grow but also help in their exit process. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Bill 2015, tabled in the Lok Sabha last December, has provisions for fast track and/or voluntary closure of businesses. With the shelf life of Internet-born companies among consumers being low for various reasons like competitive market, too many options, cashback and lucrative benefits, we think its about time that we will witness more exits happening soon. There have been some big exits in the consumer segment with the likes of Myntra, Jabong and Freecharge etc and with more and more international brands venturing into the Indian market the consumer start-up industry will witness further churn and consolidation. We definitely see a huge opportunity for B2B start-ups to grow and be a larger value addition to corporates.Globally, IBM has put capital into venture capital fundsyouve invested in over 50 fundsbut, weve not seen IBM do that in India and south-east Asia. Why is that so?Every start-up has two major requirementsresources and capital. There is no dearth of capital for the right idea and the right team, and there are many investors who are providing this. Where we can differentially add, tremendous value is from giving the much-needed strategic and technology mentorship which further helps the start-up to leverage their money in the right direction. IBM provides access to clients, access to deep technology engagement with our labs and access to mentoring and all of this without the startups giving up any equity for it.In India, you have partnered with Kalaari and Indian Angel Network to work with the start-upsbut this is for mentoring, training and educating and getting them to cloud and cognitive technologies at an early stage. How much leverage do VCs even have in influencing such decisions for their portfolio companies? We are partnering with a select few investors who are actively engaged in supporting and mentoring start-ups in incubating their ideas. At IBM, we believe that we can add value from our deep enterprise technology, our huge spend on research and probably the worlds best access to enterprise clients to help these start-ups and also VCs. We are looking beyond selling our products and solutions to becoming essential to the ecosystem through a whole range of collaborative activitiesincluding helping their portfolio companies get access to IBMs senior leadership team, by jointly working with clients, through activities like design thinking etc with Kalaari and Indian Angel Network.In areas like cloud, start-ups have several competitive optionswhat makes IBM different?IBM has been committed to the overall development of the start-up community and provides startups with free cloud credits on IBM Cloud Solutions worth $24,000 for one year helping emerging companies. We further help them to harness the power of IBM cloud, as well as connect them to IBMs vast global network of clients, consultants, innovation centers, and developers. Several start-ups across India are tapping into IBM cloud to run critical applications and grow their businesses. Both IBM Bluemix, a hybrid cloud development platform and Softlayer, a cloud infrastructure platform, have received a good response in terms of adoption from Indian startups.For start-ups, IBM does not enjoy the mind recall when it comes to looking for potential partners/ How are you working to change that, and given the pace at which IBM operates, can you ever adapt to the requirements, demands, flexibilities that the start-ups require?Indian start-ups have the quality and value to help IBM itself remain agile...so part of this focus is also to help IBMs employeestechnical, sales, business and even functional staff like HR and financelearn and remain abreast with trends. We believe our employees need to stay close to the market and where it is headed and helping in their personal and official capacity to mentor start-ups and help them to innovate. We believe in co-creating and co-innovating with the start-ups and we have an IBM Garage in Bangalore wherein we will have workshops and get start-up get access to a lot of our enterprise customers to build products together.",2016-11-11,SL6pCMJg6ebL1rewMDvayL,"There is a huge opportunity for B2B start-ups to grow, says Nipun Mehrotra, vice-president, growth initiatives, IBM India & south Asia",11:03,Indian start-ups need to focus more on B2B space: Nipun Mehrotra
0.43,"The oil ministry is set to issue a demand notice to a consortium of Reliance Industries-Shell India and Oil and Natural Gas Corp. in a bid to recover revenue share dues from hydrocarbon production at the Panna-Mukta-Tapti fields in the Arabian Sea after a London-based arbitration panel ruled mostly favouring the government earlier this month.
				   
				According to a person familiar with the development, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the government on 12 October received a favourable order on two issues relating to its share of revenue from the fields.The panel ordered that marketing margin levied by the companies from customers have to be included in the revenue to be shared with the government and that only the actual taxes paid by the contractors can be allowed as a cost and not any notional tax rate mentioned in the contract signed in 1994. In the 1994-95 financial year, corporate tax rate ranged between 45% and 65% depending on tax residence (domestic or foreign) and public interest in the company, compared to 30% at present without surcharge.On a third aspect, the government received mostly a favourable order with an option for companies to file appeals before the tribunal within a month. Based on the two orders that are final with no option for appeals, the oil ministry will calculate the dues and issue notice without waiting any further, said the person. The dues are yet to be calculated.The companies maintained that the order was only partial and that they still have a window to fight the case.Even after the panel decides on every aspect of the dispute, dissatisfied parties are free to approach English courts for further relief.The arbitration was filed by Reliance and British Gas Exploration and Production India Ltd, while ONGC did not participate. BG, the operator of the field, has been taken over by Shell in a deal between the parents Royal Dutch Shell Plc. and BG Group Plc, completed in February.A Reliance spokesperson said, With respect to the arbitration in Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields, the arbitration tribunal has by majority issued a final partial award (FPA), and separately, two dissenting opinions. RIL is presently in the process of reviewing the FPA and the dissenting opinions in detail and shall be taking the appropriate next steps based on legal advice.A spokesperson for Shell India said the company was reviewing the final partial award in detail and was unable to share any further specific details due to confidentiality restrictions.We respect the decision of the Tribunal and are committed to following the due processes applicable to legal proceedings of this nature, said the spokesperson. The Reliance spokesperson added that the tribunal has scheduled a procedural hearing on 18 and 19 December, where the procedural timetable of the arbitration is likely to be decided. At this point in time, the financial consequences of the findings in the FPA are difficult to ascertain and clarity shall emerge after the tribunal decides upon the liabilities accruing to either parties after further hearings.",2016-10-26,SiOo4yJsye7OykJVwAKl5N,Oil ministry looks to recover revenue share dues from hydrocarbon production at the fields in the Arabian Sea after an arbitration panel ruled mostly in favour of the govt,01:16,PMT fields: Govt to serve demand notice to RIL-ONGC-Shell consortium

				We have sent the Indian premier an open letter reiterating our demand to scrap the Rampal power project to save the Sundarbans through the Indian High Commission in Dhaka, national committee to protect oil, gas, mineral, resources, power and ports spokesman Anbu Mohammad said. He said the letter was sent as construction process of the plant being built with Indian assistance near the world heritage site of the Sundarbans was underway despite widespread criticism and protest from national and international experts and general public. Witnesses said police allowed five representatives of the group to hand over their letter to the High Commission as over 200 activists marched towards the mission at upmarket Gulshan diplomatic enclave. The protesters submitted the letter a day after police stopped them on their way to the Indian mission. The UNs culture and science agency Unesco, meanwhile, issued a second statement in the past month on Tuesday urging Bangladesh to halt construction of the huge coal-fired power plant reiterating its fears that it posed a serious threat to the delicate ecosystem of the Sundarbans forest. The Sundarbans in Bangladesh is part of the worlds largest mangrove forests, home to the famous Bengal Tiger and a hotspot for dolphins, turtles, and birds. Millions of people depend on this labyrinth of tidal rivers for food, homes, and flood protection, the Unesco statement read. It added, The proposed Rampal power plant, a 1,320 megawatt super-thermal power plant located just 65 kilometres from the world heritage property, poses a serious threat to the site. Unseco identified pollution from coal ash by air, pollution from wastewater and waste ash, increased shipping and dredging, and the cumulative impact of industrial and related development infrastructure as four key concerns related to the plants construction. Bangladeshi Prime minister Sheikh Hasina earlier denounced protests against the proposed coal-fired power plant. Let me tell you one thing, I would have been the first person to oppose the power plant had there been the slightest chance of damage to the Sundarbans, she had said.

				Brent crude futures, the benchmark for international oil prices, were trading at $57.34 per barrel at 4.03pm, up 45 cents from the previous close. In the United States, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $54.19 a barrel, 43 cents above their last settlement. Both contracts were largely flat on the week after days of choppy trading.Theres a lot of volatility, or at least changes in direction, ABN Amro senior energy economist Hans van Cleef said. People think the long-term trend is up, but after a gain of a few dollars, they take profit.Production cuts by Opec kingpin Saudi Arabia and signs that it plans further trims have helped buoy the market.  The Kingdom cut oil output in January by at least 486,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 10.058 million bpd, fully implementing an agreement by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and other producers to curb a global supply glut.State oil giant Saudi Aramco has started talks with customers globally on possible cuts of 3% to 7% in February crude loadings. There are also reports of supply cuts from Abu Dhabi.Still, doubts remained that all producers would fully implement planned reductions. There will be some countries who will cheat...we expect zero compliance from Baghdad... And we definitely do not expect the Kurds to join in, given that they are autonomous from the federal government, Energy Aspects said in its 2017 oil market outlook, published this week.Overall supply from Opec in December fell only slightly to 34.18 million barrels per day (bpd) from a revised 34.38 million bpd in November, according to a Reuters survey this week based on shipping data and information from industry sources.But OPEC was not the only factor; analysts pointed to a strong US dollar, which edged back from a 14-year high this week, and gains in US oil product inventories as holding them in a relatively narrow range.

Bond yields have fallen 61 basis points ever since the government announced its massive currency withdrawal move on 8 November. The benchmark 10-year yield was trading at 6.19% or 6 basis points below the overnight policy repo rate. Bond prices move inversely to yields. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
				   
				Foreign investors, true to their nimble strategies, have already cashed in on the opportunity by selling off bonds and pocketing treasury gains. Data from the Clearing Corporation of India Ltd (CCIL) shows that foreign banks sold bonds worth Rs18,244 crore between 9 November and 23 November. For public sector banks, booking profits may be a good way to salvage earnings at a time when provisioning towards bad loans is eating away profits and even resulting in huge losses for some lenders. Over the last three quarters, non-interest income that includes fee income, besides treasury profit, has been the main driver of profits for most banks as core income remained depressed. For the June quarter, the aggregate non-interest income of all listed public sector lenders rose 39% from a year ago while net interest income fell by 1.97%. For some lenders such as Punjab National Bank, non-interest income jumped 68%. Although fee income forms the lions share of non-interest income of banks, treasury gains for most lenders is at least a quarter of their other income. Within non-interest income, fee income growth is slowing. With the latest measures of waiving off charges for withdrawals from ATMs (automated teller machines), banks are bound to feel the pinch on fee income too. The countrys largest lender, State Bank of Indias fee income grew 37% for the June quarter but treasury gains surged by 53% and contributed to more than 37% of the growth in non-interest income. But public sector lenders have a unique problem. Faced with a massive surge in deposits due to the cash clean-up, lenders will have to park these inflows either with the Reserve Bank of India or into government bonds as loan disbursals are yet to pick up significantly. So even if they book profits on part of the existing portfolio, banks would likely end up being buyers of other bonds as well.

				Adi Godrej will take up the position of chairman emeritus at Godrej Properties. Karan Bolaria, currently head, Godrej Fund Management, a subsidiary of Godrej Properties, will be its new CEO. The Mumbai-based realty firm on Thursday posted a nearly fourfold jump in its net profit for the third quarter ended December to Rs77.25 crore from the corresponding period a year ago, backed by strong sales during the period.Its total income doubled to Rs518.25 crore in the quarter from Rs247.24 crore in the year-ago quarter. While I will still be hands-on, I want to focus on the long-term plan for the company. Mohit has been with the company since 2010 and is ready for this role, said Pirojsha Godrej.Godrej Properties has in many ways bucked the slowdown in the real estate sector over the past few years and emerged as one of the best performing developers. It has entered new property markets, actively launched projects and booked good sales when most developers have struggled to sell and curtailed projects launches. Godrej Properties said it registered a total booking value of Rs693 crore in the December quarter. The first phase of The Trees project in Mumbai suburb Vikhroli, which started revenue recognition, contributed almost 60% to the quarterly revenue.  It sold over 6 lakh sq. ft worth over Rs300 crore on the first day of launch of Godrej Golf Links in Greater Noida and over 300 apartments within two months of launch at Godrej Greens in Pune. Both projects were launched in November 2016. The response to our new project launches in Noida and Pune has been excellent despite challenging market conditions. As we commence the final quarter of the financial year, we look forward to building on this momentum, said Godrej. In 2017, the third and last phase of The Trees will be launched, around 3.5 lakh sq ft of residential space. The company, which has a pipeline of new projects which will be launched subject to approvals, is looking to deepen its presence in each region by entering different micro-markets. We are optimistic and believe that the impact of demonetisation along with RERA (new real estate law) and lower interest rates will boost customer confidence. Affordability is better than what it was five years ago. The new regime will also make it tough for disorganized developers to survive, Godrej said.  The strength of the brand has worked for them.

				The acquisition, by the companys UK subsidiary Piramal Critical Care,  is a prelude to Piramal Enterprisess plans to spin off and list its financial services unit and pharmaceuticals business, said chairman Ajay Piramal. In the medium term we will do that. All our acquisitions, and in some ways moving up in value chains and getting more critical mass, are steps towards that, Piramal said. Earlier this month, in a second and more conclusive restructuring of its financial services business, Piramal Enterprises moved all assets and liabilities related to lending to real estate and non-real estate projects to its unit Piramal Finance Pvt. Ltd. In the pharmaceuticals space, the latest acquisition takes  the number of Piramal buys over the last two years to seven, involving Rs3,000 crore of investment. In October, the firm, through Piramal Critical Care, acquired five anaesthesia and pain management drugs from Belgian drugmaker Janssen Pharmaceutica NV for $155 million in an all-cash deal. Size in terms of both top line and bottom line, in terms of management are critical ingredients to getting listed, Piramal said in an interview earlier this month. Whenever Piramal lists a unit, it wants to ensure that it is of a critical size, it is relevant in the market, it is not small player, he added. Any plan to create a distinct healthcare entity of the group would be welcomed by the markets as it leads to value unlocking and a focused organization for future growth,  said Gautam Kothari, associate director at Equirus Capital Pvt.Ltd.The acquisition is being funded through a combination of internal accruals and debt, the company said.The drug portfolio acquired from Mallinckrodt includes Gablofen, a severe spasticity management drug, and two other products which are under development. The deal also includes additional payment of $32 million depending on the financial performance of these drugs over the next three years. While Gablofen is currently marketed in the US, the company said it has also got approval to launch the drug in eight European markets. For the 12 months ended September, the acquired portfolio had revenue of $44.6 million (Rs303 crore). In comparison, PELs health care division reported revenue of Rs1,725 crore for the half year ended September.  We are moving up the value chain by acquiring global businesses in niche capabilities and expanding manufacturing capacities in niche areas, said Piramal. He added that the new products would boost PELs operating profits and margins besides helping to diversify its offerings in the US, which accounts for about 40% of the pharma division revenue.The acquisition would help in strengthening its presence in the US, which currently contributes around 35-40% to the companys overall pharma business. This would also give us an opportunity to play in the European markets. We are present in Europe through anaesthesia products, Piramal said, adding that the transaction would boost its presence in the global generic hospital drug market, which is worth over $20 billion in sales.Isha Trivedi contributed to this story.The story has been modified from its original version to reflect the correct designation of Gautam Kothari, associate director at Equirus Capital Pvt.Ltd.",2017-01-31,TqMhR0mTH1PRWyuslKyUXJ,Chairman Ajay Piramal says the acquisition  is a prelude to Piramal Enterprisess plans to spin off and list its financial services unit and pharma business,02:04,"Piramal Enterprises buys drug portfolio from UK firm for Rs1,160 crore"
0.17,"Mumbai: Indias software services industry, already facing pressures on profitability and revenue, has become the latest target of the Trump administrations moves to protect American jobs. 
				   
				The US administration said on Monday it had drafted an executive order to overhaul the H1B work-visa programme that software services firms based in India use to send skilled workers to the US.Alongside, a draft legislation, which among other things, calls for more than doubling the minimum salary of H1B visa holders to $130,000, was introduced in the US House of Representatives. The draft bill aims to make it difficult to replace US employees with foreign workers and experts say it is likely to deal a body blow to companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd in its present shape.ALSO READ | H1B visa reform bill introduced in US, minimum pay doubled to $130,000If implemented, the reforms may force TCS, Infosys and Wipro to make fundamental changes in their business strategies, including hiring more American workers and raising salaries they pay to employees working on client sites in the USmoves that analysts say will erode operating margins by as much as 3 percentage points.It is an adverse development, but I suspect the minimum wage limit will not rise beyond $100,000. There will be strong lobbying to curb it at that level, said Apurva Prasad, a  research analyst at HDFC Securities. Assuming the minimum wage is fixed at $100,000, the tierI Indian IT companies could take a hit of around 150-300 bps on their operating margins. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. The draft legislation also proposes to reserve 20% of the H1B visas allocated annually for firms that have 50 or fewer employees.Stocks of Indian software exporters plunged on Tuesday. TCSs shares fell 4.47%, Infosyss declined 2% and Wipros 1.62%.ALSO READ | The message from H1B visa reformsAn increase in minimum annual wage to $110,000 for H1B workers may hurt TCSs gross margin by 230 basis points and Infosyss by 170 bps, according to a December note prepared by Investec Securities. The average annual wage for a TCS employee on a H1B visa is $69,658, according to the note. Its higher for Infosy at $79,176.The contentious H1B visas are given to foreign nationals in specialty occupations that generally require higher education, who according to the US government rules include engineers, computer programmers and scientists. The government awards 65,000 such visas to foreigners every year.TCS declined to comment on the development. Infosys and Wipro didnt immediately respond to a request for comment.While tech firms claim they use the H1B visas to hire highly skilled workers in areas that lack top talent, the fact that a majority of the visas are awarded to outsourcing firms from India has drawn criticism from US politicians, who claim companies such as TCS and Infosys misuse the work visa programme to bring low-level IT workers into the US. Around 70% of H1B visas were given to workers from India, The New York Times reported in November 2015, citing  the US Department of Homeland Security.ALSO READ | H1B visas: Business as usual after short-term flapIf skills arent available in the US and per law you cant bring workers in then either the job will remain undone or the job will be shifted to India or some other location outside the US, R.

Until then, they have the time to devise their strategy to deal with this, said Sarabjit Kour Nangra, vice-president of research-IT at Angel Broking.One of the options, says Prasad of HDFC Securities, is to shift work offshore or other near-shore centres or even subcontracting to US firms.

0.47,"Mumbai: Going by the slew of measures announced in the Union budget on Wednesday, such as targeting digital transformation while discouraging cash transactions, its easy to be lulled into believing that India is well on its way to becoming a digital powerhouse.
				   
				And why not? After all, finance minister Arun Jaitley did unveil a series of post-demonetisation digital reforms, including a Rs3 lakh cap on cash transactions, which he said were aimed at fetching the government Rs2,500 crore in revenue. While the initiatives to build a digital India are undoubtedly important, we cannot ignore the fact that India has a long way to go becoming digital. Here are a few reasons:For one, India still ranks a poor 91 on the Networked Readiness Index (NRI) 2016a key component of the World Economic Forums The Global Information Technology Report 2016. The report assesses the state of networked readiness of 139 economies using the NRI and examines the role of information and communication technologies (ICT) in driving innovation. It is thus a key tool in assessing a countrys preparedness to reap the benefits of emerging technologies and capitalize on the opportunities presented by the digital transformation.Also read: Budget 2017: Arun Jaitley unveils series of post-demonetisation digital reformsThe 2016 edition of the NRI placed Singapore at the top of the list of countries when it comes to networked readiness. Finland, which topped the ranking in 2014, came second for the second year in a row, followed by Sweden, Norway and the US, which climbed two places. The remaining top 10 comprised the Netherlands, Switzerland, the UK, Luxembourg and Japan. Networked readiness, therefore, is correlated to per-capita income.Not only was India ranked 91 among 138 countries in 2016, but WEFs figures also showed that India had actually fallen 23 places in the NRI ranking in the last four years. In 2013, when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government was in power, India was ranked 68 on the index out of 144 countries. When the Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government took over in May 2014, the ranking slipped to 83 out of 148 countries. In 2015, Indias ranking fell to 89 out of 143 countries. And in 2016, it slipped two places to 91 out of 138 countries.While Indias absolute score has changed only marginally in recent years, other countries are racing ahead at faster speeds. Lack of infrastructure and low levels of skills among the population remain the key bottlenecks to widespread ICT adoption, especially in terms of individual usageissues that governments have attempted to address over the last 10 years.Also read: Union Budget 2017: The winners and losersAs the WEF report pointed out in its 2016 edition, a deep divide persists between well-connected metropolitan hubs and remote rural areas, which lack even the most basic infrastructure. This implies that BharatNets implementation track record needs to significantly improve for the benefits to reach rural India.Second, Indias spirited talk about becoming a cashless economy happened when the Indian government invalidated high-value banknotes on the night of 8 November, taking out 86% of the currency in circulation by value. It was supposed to be a war on unaccounted and untaxed wealth, counterfeit notes and terror financing. Instead, as serpentine queues formed outside bank branches and automated teller machines (ATMs) went dry for days and weeks together, the slogan changed. It became all about promoting a cashless or at least a less-cash culture in an economy where almost 90% of transactions are paid for in cash. Indians can boast about technologies such as mobile wallets, crypto-currencies such as bitcoin, mobile peer-to-peer payments, blockchain technology, payment banks and architecture such as the unified payments interface (UPI) and the recently-launched Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) app.  But the government is yet to devise a police on online security. The Indian IT Act (2008) alone will not suffice.Third, Digital Indias Rs1.3 trillion programmewhich envisages a plethora of e-governance services across sectors like healthcare, education and banking, and promises to introduce transparency in the system, reduce corruption and achieve inclusive growthwas only given the green light in 2015. And while the Modi government was simply building on the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) that was approved in 2006 under the previous government, it is obvious that digital programmes do not bear fruit overnight.Also read: Budget 2017: A minimalist approach for an evolving IndiaSmart cities are a case in point. It takes 30-40 years to build a city. Programs like Smart Cities and Make in India will require considerable investments in terms of manpower, technological upgrades, skill development, digital literacy and, most importantly, a plethora of standards to be laid out and adhered to. The Internet of Things (IoT) which entails hundreds of thousands of sensors will need interoperability of standards and security policies in place so that our smart devices, smart homes, smart grids and smart cities are not paralysed by smart cybercriminals.Fourth, while one can see tangibles like the governments Digital Locker and other e-services ride on a robust GI Cloud, also known as Meghraj, Internet speeds are poor in India despite the spread of fourth generation (4G) technology. Mobile calls still drop routinely in Digital India. Not to mention that many people in villages still do not have an Internet connection or enough local language content.Fifth is the power of online education. In a bid to bridge the digital divide through online education, Jaitley on Wednesday also announced that the governments Swayam platform, which has been developed by the ministry of human resource development and All India Council for Technical Education with the help of Microsoft Corp., will start offering 350 online courses. Swayam would be ultimately capable of hosting 2,000 courses and 80,000 hours of learning, covering school, under-graduate, post-graduate, engineering, law and other professional courses, according to its website.While online courses are definitely the need of the hour, they again will be dependent on high-speed broadband connectivity, a digital mindset, and more importantly, government recognition for online course certificates without which there will be few takers.India is at the cusp of a massive digital transformation, said Jaitley as he listed digital as one of the 10 key themes in Union Budget 2017. This will indeed be the case if the government does not ignore the hurdles too.",2017-02-01,TvYXoyeYP9Duo3VSGlcCMK,"While the initiatives to build a digital India are undoubtedly important, we cannot ignore the fact that India has a long way to go becoming digital",16:40,Budget 2017: Five reasons why Digital India wont happen in a hurry
0.39,"Mahindra and Mahindra Ltds (M&Ms) September quarter performance matched investor expectations on the back of robust farm equipment sales that surpassed the industry average. 
				   
				A good monsoon and pent-up demand fuelled farm equipment sales that nearly doubled from a year back. Consequently, operating leverage led to a 180 basis points margin expansion to 17.7%, in spite of lower money realized on sales.In contrast, the auto segments performance was tepid giving little reason for investors to cheer. An 11.7% growth in auto sales was unimpressive. Margins too fell slightly year-on-year. In contrast, during the previous boom, M&Ms auto salesmainly utility vehiclesbeat industry growth rates. Thankfully, the quarter under consideration was not as bad as in the recent past, when both auto and tractor sales were pathetic due to the demand slowdown and the firms profits went downhill. Including Mahindra Vehicle Manufacturers Ltd, the firms 15.3% growth in consolidated net revenue trickled down to a 28.3% jump in higher operating profit from a year ago. Although this was in line with Bloombergs average estimates, it has led to concerns on the future outlook. Indeed, while the management has revved up fiscal year 2017 forecast for the farm equipment segment from 13-15% to 20%, the outlook for the auto segment is worrisome. Thats one reason why the stock closed 6% lower on Friday. An Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd report points out that M&Ms new launches in the automotive segment have lost steam and flagship products like Bolero also suffered due to higher excise duty (30%). Besides, with new product launches planned for the second half of FY18, the strategy is to push sales of existing products. Meanwhile, the demonetization imbroglio could also have a short-term bearing on M&Ms sales, given that a significant part of its sales are to rural customers.",2016-11-14,U6Rr1LTDu3m3CwpQNqoAPO,A good monsoon and pent-up demand fuelled farm equipment sales that nearly doubled from a year ago.,05:19,Tractors rev up as auto segment wobbles at Mahindra and Mahindra
-0.26,"Over the last fortnight, capital goods giant Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (Bhel) has been in the news as it has commissioned several thermal units. For the year ended 31 March 2016, the firm also boasts the highest number of projects commissioned in the last five years. Whats more, it has an order book that is four times its trailing annual revenue. Simply put, it means that Bhels Rs.1.1 trillion order book is enough to generate revenue for the next four years.
				   
				But all this has mattered little to investors. In the past year, the companys stock is down by over 50%. Why?Nearly half of Bhels orders are from the power sector, where projects are stranded for want of clearances. Obviously, projects are moving at a slow pace, leading to cost overruns.On the industrial side, too, clients are in no hurry to get projects off the ground. Recent macroeconomic data echoes the same. Manufacturing activity in the country is down and gross fixed capital formation during the March quarter contracted from a year ago by 1.9%, making it the lowest in two years.Besides, analysts concede that most of the recent orders were at low margins because of the stiff competition in the industry. All these factors mean that there will be challenges to revenue and profit traction.The companys March quarter performance bears testimony to this. Revenue declined by 22% year-on-year and operating margin at 3.6% was way below 7% that the Street had forecast. The management too appears worried about such projects. The quarters profit was below expectation partly due to provisions made towards doubtful debts and liquidated damages.Thats not all. The next three years may be challenging for order inflows too. Data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy paints a rather gloomy picture for power equipment manufacturers. The annual plant load factor for Indias thermal and nuclear power stations is down from 78% in fiscal year 2008 to about 62% in FY16. Whats worse is that the peak energy deficit is also dropping, indicating that there is no demand for power. These circumstances undermine the need for more power capacity. According to a note by Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd, Bhel accounts for about two-thirds of the industrys power equipment capacity of 30 GW (gigawatts), whereas order inflows over the next two to three years, is unlikely to cross 12-15 GW. This implies stiff competition and weak pricing power, impairing profit margins.Given these challenges, it is not surprising that a huge order backlog and a steep 55% jump in order inflows, even in the recent March quarter, failed to cheer investors and power the stock. Macro challenges are likely to tell on Bhels profitability and are too steep to tide over in the near term.",2016-06-17,UBdHphJekVbJ3r5NQvAYJO,"In spite of an order book of Rs1.1 trillion, analysts see challenges to Bhels revenue and profit traction

				Even as bank investors cheered, the transaction with a group led by Russias Rosneft PJSC points to the fact that the Indian banking system still has to depend on sale of assets by debtors to achieve true resolution of soured loans.The operating company debt, which includes (that of) Essar Oil, Vadinar Port and Vadinar Power, where the total debt is about $5 billion, will become part of this transaction. This would be a shade over 50% of the operating companys term debt. In addition to this, another $5 billion debt of holding company will also be deleveraged, said Prashant Ruia, director, Essar Group. He didnt reveal the total debt of the group, which brokerages such as Kotak Institutional Equities estimate at Rs1.3 trillion. The deal value of $13 billion is the enterprise value of the assets being sold. The remaining proceeds from the deal will be used to restructure the debt of Essar Steel, settle some of the working capital debt and some will go to the promoters, said Ruia.While we are yet to sit down and discuss this in detail with the Essar Group promoters, the expectation is that some parts will come to the steel company too, a senior official at a large state-owned bank said on condition of anonymity.According to Ruia, the promoters are open to investing further equity in the groups steel company if the restructuring proposal requires them to do so. Prospects at Essar Steel are looking up. We are functioning at about 70% capacity. The project is already completed. We will reach close to full capacity in two quarters, said Ruia. Whatever were the problems of the past, (they) have now been overcome. Essar Steel will soon become the crown jewel of the group, just like Essar Oil was.Most lenders in Essar Steel have classified the Rs40,000-crore account as a non-performing asset, with some such as ICICI Bank Ltd, HDFC Bank Ltd, Federal Bank and Axis Bank Ltd selling either part or all of their exposure to Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Co.

In an interview, Hitesh Oberoi, chief executive of Naukri and its holding company Info Edge (India) Ltd, talks about how Naukri has grown as a business and Indias changing jobs scenario. He also speaks about how Info Edge is growing from being the holding company for a hiring firm into an investor role and if it would invest further in Zomato. If we see an opportunity to acquire a company and own 100% in it, we will do (it), Oberoi says. Edited excerpts:
As a leading jobs match maker, how do you see the jobs space shaping up in India?What weve seen for the last two years is growth reviving but it is not secular  not across sectors. Growth for the last six to eight quarters has been driven largely by IT sectors, Internet services, e-commerce. Now, we see banking and financial services also picking up, pharma has also been strong. Services have been doing okay. We are worried about a slowdown in IT, and IT companies are talking about it.How has Naukri changed as a businessfrom one dot com boom to another?When we got funded in 2000, after two years of our existence, there were only two million Internet users in the country. Nobody even understood how the Internet could be used for hiring. So what we did in the first few years was to educate, acquire and train customers on how to use Naukri for hiring. In the last few years, Internet has become mainstream. Some 350-400 million people are online. Smartphones are omnipresent. Companies now hire more than 50% via online. They must be using Naukri, other job boards, their own websites, a referral hiring programme, social media, etc.We have seen a massive shift from print hiring 15 years ago to bulk hiring through online. And this will only accelerate. We are trying hard to enable e-hiring for companies. Naukri is offering a career site management service where we power company career sites through our software.Is the career site management service helping to diversify your portfolio?We saw this coming a few years ago. We have 65,000 corporate customersfirms big and small. We realized that they still dont hire completely from Naukri. They still want to use their career websites, referral hiring programmes. So, we started diversifying to these areas. We now have a referral hiring manager and have facilities which help companies run their referral hiring programme through a portal. We see this as an opportunity for us to develop new revenue streams over time. Today, single digits in percentage terms of revenue comes from these products but it could become substantial in the coming 4-5 years. Naukri is a Rs500 crore business, and even 5% of that is a significant number...(it) can become double digit in five years.Earlier, Naukri was the flagship brand, but now Info Edge is becoming a venture capital kind of play with several investments. Is Info Edge growing as an investor rather than a hiring company?Naukri is still maybe 70% of our revenue, but there are other operating businesses which are now growing rapidly and are becoming bigger. For example, 99 acres did about Rs115 crore revenue last year and is growing at a faster rate than Naukri. Jeevansathi has turned profitable. Shiksha business is also breaking even. These three businesses, on a quarterly basis are generating a revenue of about Rs55-60 crore for us, bigger than most of the Internet companies out there. So, we are fairly bullish that going forward these businesses will become big.And this does not include Zomato. Outside, we have invested in 10 or 12 companies, and some of these will also do very well. We see ourselves as an operating company. We have these three-four verticals in the company...they bring us cash and enable us to invest outside. Hopefully the outside investments will become large and increase our overall top line.I would not say that we are a VC player, but yet if there is a good opportunity, we dont mind investing outside. But we dont have a fund like any other VC would have...We look at opportunity, if we see more opportunity in the internal business, well invest there and similarly for outside. If we see an opportunity to acquire a company and own 100% in it, we will do (it).You have invested around Rs860 crore, do we see this growing by certain percentage over next three years?For example, we own 50% of Zomato and thats a lot. We dont go by targets, we go by opportunities. If we see an opportunity, we dont mind whether it is inside the company or whether it is an acquisition opportunity or an investment.Yes we have some basic rules, like we dont like to invest in non-Internet businesses, we try and invest mostly in India-focused business, restrict ourselves to the consumer Internet space, we like businesses inside our market places. These are the broad guidelines which we follow while investing, but we are open. So Naukri may become much less than 60-70% of the business?If it happens because other businesses are growing then its fine, but if Naukri is not growing then thats a problem. We actually see a lot of opportunity in the job business, because we are very diversified and working on different things. And who knows if GDP growth picks up-for every 1% GDP growth, our business (Naukri) grows 8-10%.  You spoke about Zomato, are you investing further in them?Zomato has had a very good run for the last few months, they have cut down their burn immensely. Revenue has gone up and they are sitting on a lot of cash. I would say they are comfortable today but tomorrow theyll try to raise money as they will need it for growth and opportunities, well see at that point of time.",2017-01-18,UKeBtqn6OUjrVEmDLTAzhP,"Naukri, Info Edge (India) CEO Hitesh Oberoi on Indias changing jobs scenario, investments in Zomato and how Info Edge is growing into an investor role",00:40,We are worried about a slowdown in IT: Naukri CEO Hitesh Oberoi
-0.3,"Call it crony capitalism or any other term you wish. Large borrowersand significantly the top 100 largest debtorsare primarily responsible for the bad loan problem in Indian banks. Thats the inescapable conclusion from the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBIs) June financial stability report.
				   
				Consider chart 1: The share of large borrowers in total gross non-performing assets (NPAs) has increased to 86.4% at the end of March. Their share in loans is only 58%. Large borrowers are described by RBI as those who have aggregate fund-based and non-fund based exposure of at least Rs.5 crore. Their share of gross bad loans has increased faster than their share of total bank credit over the past year.Even among large borrowers, it is the largest, the top 100 entities, who are responsible for the sharp deterioration seen following the central banks asset quality review.Consider chart 2: The gross bad loans of the top 100 borrowers, among the largest corporate groups in the country, have jumped to 22.3% of bad loans of large borrowers, up from 0.8% a year ago. Put it another way, these top 100 borrowers account for 19.3% of all bank bad loans at the end of March compared with 0.7% a year ago.That, of course, leads to the question: whats the reason for the sudden spike in bad loans? If anything, economic growth has been improving according to official figures.The answer lies in chart 3.Large borrowers have been enjoying the fruit of banks forbearance for quite some time. After the central banks asset quality review, lenders have been forced to reveal all these skeletons and re-classify them as NPAs. As chart 3 shows, there has been a sharp decline in advances classified as SMA-2 and restructured standard. SMA-2, or special mention account-2, are those accounts where principal or interest payment was overdue between 61 days and 90 days.The decline in these two categories is almost equal to the rise in gross bad loans. That there is still more pain to come is reflected in the 35% increase in assets classified as SMA-1 (principal or interest overdue between 31 days and 60 days), which is an early signal of stress in asset quality.",2016-06-29,URelrQgfpNPeGpDsnIs0xN,"Large borrowers, and significantly the top 100 largest debtors, are primarily responsible for the bad loan problem in Indian banks, says RBIs June financial stability report

0.43,"Bengaluru: The squabble between rival factions owing allegiance to Cyrus Mistry and Ratan Tata at the Tata group could mask the potentially poor performance of individual companies. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) could be one beneficiary.
				   
				According to BNP Paribas, TCS will report a 6% increase in dollar revenue in the current financial year, down from last years 7%. Even this projection looks a tad generous, and, according to Mint calculations, TCS runs the risk of less than 5.6% growth.Put simply, TCS, for the first time since it clocked 5.4% growth in 2009-10, could add less than $1 billion in incremental revenue this year. And that could ring alarm bells at TCS, which ended with $16.5 billion in revenue in the financial year to March last year.TCS will report its fiscal third quarter earnings on Thursday.Accenture Plc., a firm about twice as large as TCS, recorded 6% growth in the year ended August (Accenture follows a September-August financial year). Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solution Corp., which was about half of TCSs size of $6 billion in 2009when Natarajan Chandrasekaran became the CEO of TCSwill still manage 9% growth to end the year with at least $13.5 billion in revenue (Cognizant follows the calendar year as financial year).At the heart of TCSs underperformance, which started manifesting in July 2014, is its inability to build a stronger consulting practice and the managements reluctance to buy small firms for technologies like design consulting and data analytics and automation platform providers. TCS also faces some client-specific challenges, all of which have led to low growth. Still, over the last two years, this has not stopped TCS management from claiming the company is making itself future-ready. The biggest concern for stakeholders is if TCS will continue to chug along in 2017-18 and disappoint with depressing growth numbers. For now, the signals are not bright. With this as the backdrop, Mint puts the spotlight on five things to watch in TCSs third quarter earnings on 12 January:1. Revenue growth and management commentary on the demand outlookBNP Paribas expects TCSs dollar revenue to inch up 0.3% to $4.39 billion in the October-December period on a sequential basis. Most brokerages do not expect any significant uptick in growth in the current quarter, either. Nonetheless, management commentary on demand for companys services from clients, especially in Europe and US, will be crucial.2. Pressure on profitability Since January last year, TCSs operating margins have been under pressure. Its 26.1% Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin at the end of March quarter was 54 basis points less than margins at the end of October-December period of 2014. The companys margins further contracted to 25.1% at the end of June quarter, and improved to 26% at the end of July-September period. Now, as commoditized deals come under further pricing pressure, traditional levers like going slow on hiring will not be enough to offset the gradual decline in profitability. For this reason, most analysts are doubtful if TCS will be able to operate in the managements stated guidance of 26-28%.3. Performance in the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) and retail sectorsAccentures performance in the September-November period and management commentary suggests some weakness in business from clients in the BFSI sector. This spells trouble for a company like TCS, which generates more than 40% of its business from BFSI. Retail segment too has seen a decline, and for this reason, management commentary on BFSI and retail, which together bring about 54% of its total revenue, will be eyed.4. Impact of US bill seeking to increase pay to employees with H1B visasEarlier this month, a legislation demanding that outsourcing firms pay at least $100,000 a year to employees who work in the US was introduced in the Congress. Analysts and industry executive believe it could take up to a year before the US makes this a law. Washingtons demand that companies like TCS pay a minimum wage of $100,000 to employees with H1B visas could hurt profitability by 300-500 basis points, according to a 9 January note by JPMorgan Chase and Co. analyst Viju George. Management commentary on this will be watched.5. Weak sectors and geographiesTCS does not expect growth to rebound in Japan. The company claims to have arrested any loss of business from its UK-based insurance platform Diligenta. Growth from telecoms segment continue to be wobbly. Together, underperformance by the three units eroded about 2% growth from the companys 11.9% growth on constant currency basis in 2015-16.

0.31,"For the past two decades, every time the management of Dabur India Ltd met to finalize a new product, it ended up also debating whether to stick to Ayurveda or to focus on non-Ayurvedic products.
				   
				The decision to launch non-Ayurvedic products came 113 years after S.K. Burman set up Dabur in 1884 in Kolkata. In 1997, the home-grown Ayurvedic products maker launched Project STARS (Strive to Achieve Record Successes) to accelerate growth through diversification. It launched Real, a fruit-based beverage.Ayurveda cannot take Dabur far, the Burmans were convinced. So, the family that popularized Ayurveda in India moved away from its core strength.Over the next 19 years, the companys focus intensified so much on non-Ayurveda products that just the food business accounted for about 11% of its Rs8,436 crore revenue in the year to March 2016 and 18% of domestic sales came from foods. Not just food, it launched a number of non-Ayurvedic products in segments like personal care and home care as well. Overall, about 40% of its sales came from non-Ayurvedic products in the year to March 2016. The wheel of change was set for a spin. But then came yoga-guru-turned-businessman Baba Ramdev. Under his company Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd, he launched a range of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) based on Ayurveda. In recent months, ever since Patanjali started aggressive advertising on television, it has challenged companies such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), Colgate-Palmolive (India) Ltd, Nestlé India Ltd that compete in Indias Rs3.2 trillion-a-year consumer packaged goods market.Theres more. Going by Ramdevs projections, Patanjali will cross Rs10,000 crore in revenue in fiscal year 2017from Rs5,000 crore in FY16. This is more than what brokerage firm Morgan Stanley India Co. Pvt Ltd projected as Dabur Indias revenue in FY17Rs 9,630 crore.Besides, Dabur started feeling the pinch as sales of its honey (a product that is estimated to have more than 65% market share) started declining earlier this year as people  bought Patanjalis cheaper variety.The Burmans realized that Dabur needs to get back to basics and return to its coreAyurveda.The future, says Dabur India chief executive officer (CEO) Sunil Duggal, will be driven by Ayurvedic products. With this validation (success of Patanjali), we are more committed to staying and growing the natural equities and not string into other domains. So it provides a lot more focus to the companys activities and a lot more opportunities to grow within spaces that we are familiar with rather than to get into unfamiliar spaces which obviously would be much riskier, he adds.There were reasons why Dabur was unsure about sticking to only Ayurvedic products.The Burmans wanted to build an empire outside Indiaacross the Middle East, Africa, Europe, North America and South Asia, which together accounts for 32% of Daburs consolidated sales at present. Across all these countries, Ayurveda was never a popular or saleable concept. So the shift was only  natural.Although Dabur was probably the only Indian company that was selling products made of Ayurvedic formulations nationwide, it was unsure about how far it could take Ayurveda. Till recently, the ability of Ayurvedic products to go deeper was under some question. Ayurveda can go deep in certain areas, not all. Like skin care, it may not go that deep. But we are now beginning to question that paradigm. Now we are far more convinced that Ayurveda can go far deeper in many areas than what we thought earlier, says Duggal.Faith vs evidence A couple of months ago, the company revamped its marketing communications with a new taglineScience-based Ayurveda. So far, it was celebrate life. All our advertisements and other communications are now based on one themeScience of Ayurveda. There have been changes in packaging and marketing communications as well. We need to be relevant to the youth, says K.K. Chutani, executive director (marketing) at Dabur India. Besides, in February this year it tied up with e-commerce marketplace Snapdeal to set up an e-store for its Ayurveda products called LiveVEDA. Chutani believes, e-commerce was an imperative for Daburs future.The rationale behind Daburs new communication is its history. The Burmans have been marketing Ayurveda for more than 130 years. But it cant just bank on its history or legacy. The platform that we are going to leverage is the science-based Ayurveda, backed by research, validation and hard evidences. It will appeal to a lot of people who may not believe in faith-based Ayurveda (unlike Ramdevs followers), adds Chutani. Emergence of Patanjali, believes CEO Duggal, is a blessing in disguise for Dabur. Patanjali products are sold primarily based on peoples faith in Ramdev. His marketing and Patanjalis well-spread retail presence has already, and probably would, convert a lot of non-Ayurdevic product users into regular users of Ayurvedic or herbal products. There has been some learning from Ramdev. To my mind, he has given a big impetus to Ayurveda and his large number of followers are driving it. The desire for Ayurvedic solutions runs very deep in Indian psychology. It would be very silly of us not to take advantage of that, says Duggal, who joined Dabur in 1995 and became CEO in 2002.By 2020, Dabur targets Ayurvedic products to constitute more than 75% of its sales in India, from around 60% now.To focus more on Ayurvedic formulations, the company is doubling its herb cultivation. By March 2017, Dabur will have 3,800 acres for medicinal herb farming, up from about 2,000 acres at present that it has developed during past two decades. It also has a greenhouse at Pantnagar in Uttarakhand. The company will be spending Rs600 crore in back-end supply chain. The medicinal farming will be spread across eight states in India and Nepal, and engage about 2,500 farmers, up from 1,200 at present.We have been marrying the age-old Ayurvedic heritage and traditions with cutting-edge scientific prowess. We have a strong in-house research wing that follows a bush-to-brand approach. We have our in-house nursery, which grows several rare herbs that go into various products. Dabur is probably the only company which is involved in both classical or ethical as well as OTC (over-the-counter) formulation research for close to 40 years now, says J.L.N. Sastry, head (research and development, Ayurveda) at Dabur India. In a note on 21 September, Citi Research, a division of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., said, Dabur claims to focus on science-based high quality Ayurveda products with an emphasis on R&D, which makes it well positioned to ride this wave.Countering PatanjaliIn May, Dabur launched an advertisement for its honey which said it was approved by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) that ensures safety. Patanjalis honey does not have FSSAI approval. The ad came on the back of a drop in sales of Dabur honey at the beginning of the year. The company has been selling honey since 1994  and dominates the market with close to a two-thirds share.However, Patanjali honey directly hit Dabur primarily because of the price difference. Daburs honey was priced about 40% higher than Patanjalis. We got things corrected through offers and other things. We find people who switched are returning. But there is a section of people, financially stressed, who may not come back. But we have to deal with that. We cant have all things for all people, says Duggal. The company also launched brand extensions like honey fruit spreads.Interestingly, in an earlier Mint interview, Ramdev said his rivalry was with multinational companies (MNCs) not the home-grown ones like Dabur. But a Patanjali spokesperson said that even if Dabur is an Indian company, it has no right to loot people. Products are overpriced. Be it an Indian company or MNC, it should operate ethically, and products should be economical. With Patanjali, backed by Baba Ramdevs marketing, the market for Ayurvedic and herbal or natural products has expanded, which certainly is an opportunity for everyone, he added.Commenting on FSSAI certification, or the lack of it, the spokesperson said that Patanjalis honey had passed all required tests and is safe. As honey is a products that is consumed both as a medicine and a food item, FSSAI approval is not mandatory, he added.Besides honey, even Daburs toothpaste sales were impacted but Duggal dismisses concerns about it by saying the category has not been growing. In fact, Dabur Chyawanprash, the market leader with an estimated 65% share, also faced stiff competition after Patanjali started mass marketing Chyawanprash at a much lower price last year. But its impact was not severe, maintains Duggal.However, Dabur narrowed the price gap with Patanjali and tried establishing Chyawanprash, a predominantly winter product, as a product relevant for others seasons like monsoon through intense promotional activities. With Patanjali coming in, the category might grow better. He (Ramdev) will convert a lot of non-users into Chyawanprash users. He could be a good ambassador for Chyawanprash, adds Duggal.In a note on 21 September, Citi Research  said, Dabur has been managing competitive intensity well through brand building (strong digital push), value-added variants or formats and by reducing price premiums in segments like honey with price-offs and promotions... Reducing the pricing premium with extra weight (such as 1.25 kg for the price of 1 kg) and / or price-offs, upping the ante on honey brand building and the extension to value-added variants and formats are examples of a well-rounded approach to tackle the aggressive competition from Patanjali.Daburs challenge, according to Sunita Sachdev, an analyst with UBS Securities India Pvt. Ltd, is to re-invent its brand and make itself relevant to the current crop of consumers. Getting back to its rootsAyurvedais very appropriate, said Sachdev.Peer pressureDabur India isnt under pressure from Patanjali alone. Competition in the domestic market in the last few years has increased as almost every packaged goods companyhome-grown and multinationalhas rolled out products that are herbal or natural. The trend has been triggered largely by Patanjalis success and the opportunity the category offers for premiumization of products.In recent years, HUL and Colgate, local units of MNCs, have ramped up their portfolios with premium Ayurvedic products in key brands. Home-grown Emami Ltd and Himalaya Drug Co., which have been selling herbal or Ayurvedic products for long, have gained from their traditional herbal positioning. These companies are extending brands into new and emerging segments to improve profitability. And all of them are trying to expand. While Emami bought Ayurvedic hair oil and shampoo brand Kesh King from SBS Biotech Ltd in June 2015 for Rs1,651 crore, HUL acquired Kerala-based Indulekha hair oil brand for Rs330 crore earlier this year to boost its presence in Ayurvedic space.Interestingly, Dabur was the first to tap the hair oil space with a herbal product Dabur Amla hair oil back in 1940 and expanded its hair care portfolio in early 1990s with Vatika brand. But it failed to leverage the advantage of an early entrant.Admits Duggal, We never thought products like shampoo can be marketed as an Ayurvedic product. With recent developments in the market, we are now thinking of launching Ayurvedic shampoo. Some of our bets will work, some may not. But Ayurveda can go beyond the imagination of people.Herbal or Ayurvedic still constitutes a very small part of personal care market in India. According to a research report (September 2015) by UBS Securities India, herbal products comprise 6-7% of the personal care products market, but the volume is growing at about twice the segment average. The report estimated herbal to grow to about 10% of the segment by FY20 as the trend accelerates.Duggal, however, believes Dabur has the advantage of being a company that has been the original marketer of Ayurveda in India. There are differences between Ayurveda and herbal. Herbal is a step before Ayurveda. Ayurveda is a completely different ball game, he adds.Distressed economyBesides increasing competition, slow growth is a serious worry for Dabur too.In April-June 2016 quarter, the companys sales grew just 1.2%. In the quarter ended March 2016, it reported a 4% increase in volume in the domestic market compared to a 7% growth in the preceding quarter. Post results, the management had painted a cautious outlook for FY17. It expects things to get better only in the second half of FY17. The key challenge that we are facing today is that theres a radical downward shift in the overall consumption of consumer goods because of tapering of the stimulus that was provided by the earlier government and has not been taken forward by the current government. The current government is following an investment-led growth and not consumption-led growth that has triggered a consumption stress, primarily in rural market, which was the prime driver of growth between 2008 and 2014, says Duggal.A double-digit growth is very unlikely in the next one-two years for the packaged consumer goods firms. I am hoping for 6-8%. I never expected this sharp a decline in consumption. I knew it will come down but not from 12% to 3-4%, says Duggal, adding that consumption will improve in  a gradual manner starting 2018.Two consecutive poor monsoons also hurt consumption. A relatively good monsoon, coupled with the seventh pay commission money in the system, is likely to provide some impetus that would help consumption recover. However, the picture is not that dismal as packaged goods companies like Dabur are enjoying high marginsthanks to stability in commodity prices resulting in low input costs. Its a good thing. But the downside of the combination of high margin and low demand will typically lead to a lot of pricing activities. Reduction of prices in some cases and aggressive promotions are obvious. Well have to deal with that aspect. Some of the margins may be passed on to the consumers, adds Duggal.Rewriting ruralAbout 45% of Dabur Indias domestic revenue comes from rural markets and, as mentioned above, consumption in rural markets has not been growing for the last few years. Naturally, the company not only stopped expanding its distribution network in rural areas, in the last one year it also stepped out of certain markets to minimize its risk.Thats not all. It also reorganized its sales force in rural markets. The company hired about 1,000 people to sell its products in villages starting this April. Earlier, village sales representatives were under the payrolls of third-party human resource companies. Dabur is shelling out the same amount of money but the village sales representatives are earning more as their salaries are not being shared by third-party firms. They are the sons of the soil. They understand these markets. With them coming on our rolls, productivity and sales have improved. Rural markets will start growing again. Well ramp up distribution and marketing to capture the growth prospects thats expected in the second half of the year, adds Duggal. Dabur typically pays Rs2 lakh a year and incentives to the village sales representatives.Tweaks in distribution and go-to-market efforts, according to the Citi Research note, will help Dabur improve productivity of the enhanced footprint, besides doctor detailing could be a key driver for healthcare offerings.For urban markets, the company, in June, divided its portfolio in four pieces home and personal care, healthcare, OTC medicines, and food and beverages. Theres a separate sales team for each of these segments. Earlier there were three segmentsOTC, FMCG and food. The change is aimed at bringing a deeper focus on individual segments.Dabur products now reach around 5.3 million outlets. In comparison, HUL reaches about 6.3 million of the estimated 8 million retail outlets in India. Cigarette-to-shampoo maker ITC Ltd reaches to around 4.3 million retail stores.Advantage spreadDabur has a unique mix of diverse growth enginesjuices, healthcare, skincare, international business and home care. And, it has four cash cowshair oils, digestives, health supplements and toothpastes. The growth engines, noted Morgan Stanley in a report, can use cash cows to generate consistent, superior growth. Dabur has the ability to launch highly differentiated product offerings across its product portfolio, catalyzed by the recent success of Patanjali, increase in disposable incomes, lifestyle changes and increasing awareness of Ayurvedic products, it report added.OTC products are seen as the most exciting growth opportunity for Dabur, backed by the companys brand strength, knowledge of Ayurveda, doctor advocacy, and product heritage. We expect a slew of launches over the next few quarters with a focus on daily healthcare and lifestyle ailments. This business also has one of the best gross profit margin profiles. We believe growth will inflect as consumers perceive these products as being efficacious for overall health and wellness and likely balance out the adverse impact of rapid changes in lifestyles currently under way, said the Morgan Stanley analysis.Eyes on buysAcquisition was one of the routes that helped Dabur grow, mainly in markets outside India. The company, which has more than Rs2,200 crore of cash on its balance sheet, is now looking for buyouts in India to ensure faster growth. In the last few years, organic growth has been slow and Dabur has not made a pitch to acquire any firm. The companys deals team is already working on a few targets. Despite the fact that the management is open to spending about Rs1,000 crore on acquisitions, Dabur is only looking for small buys. I like small brands that are scalable, primarily regional brands with national relevance. I hope to close at least one deal by end of this financial year, says Duggal.Dabur is looking at Ayurvedic brands and brands in the adjacent areas. It is unlikely to buy any company that is in the generic products space as that could conflict with its existing product offering. There are a few generic products, but buying a generic product maker would be replication. Thats one of the reasons why we did not buy Zandu (which got sold to Emami in 2008), he adds.Likely acquisition targets could be companies that make branded proprietary products in areas such as digestion, cough and cold, fever, lifestyle disease management, among others. However, there are not many targets in the market.Acquisitions make sense. Despite high valuations, Emamis acquisition of Kesh King and HULs Indulekha buyout were relatively successful, says Sachdev of UBS Securities.Its key acquisitions in India include Balsara Hygiene Products Ltd, maker of Babool toothpaste and Odonil air freshner, in 2005 and female skin care products maker Fem Care Pharma in 2008. Over the years, some of the brands it acquired from these two firms, such as Fem, Babool and Odonil, have crossed the Rs100-crore sales mark. Even its international business has primarily grown through acquisitions post- 2010. International woes About 32% of Daburs consolidated revenue comes from international markets by selling personal care products across the Middle East, Africa, Europe, North America and South Asia. The Middle East is the biggest market that accounts for 33% of the companys international sales, followed by Africa (22%), Americas (17%), Asian markets excluding India (17%) and Europe (11%).But companies, including Dabur, have been facing challenges in these markets mainly due to political uncertainties, currency fluctuations and falling oil prices. Low oil prices have led to a downward pressure on oil producing economies with governments adopting austerity measures, curbing spending on major projects and reducing subsidies which has eroded disposable incomes. Most of the markets have witnessed sharp depreciation in their currencies which has led to lower value realizations in our business. Geo-political turmoil in MENA (Middle East and North Africa) has, to a large extent, impacted markets such as Syria, Libya, Yemen, Iraq and others where there has been a reduction in consumption due to large scale displacement of human population, says Mohit Malhotra, CEO of Dabur International Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dabur India.Dabur, however, will continue to invest in these marketsin brands, distribution and building local supply chains to ensure better pricing and margin.Also see | Our aim is to make Dabur a multinational from India: Amit BurmanIn July, Dabur India acquired Discaria Trading, registered in South Africa, for just Rs4,679 (1,000 South African rand). It was a small but important acquisition. With this, the company got an entry to South Africaa market it has been trying enter for a long time. Dabur already has two manufacturing plantsone each in Nigeria and Egypt.Africa has been on the radar of Indian packaged goods and personal care firms for the past few years primarily because of projected consumer spending. Consulting firm McKinsey and Co., in a report in 2010, projected consumer spending in Africa to double to $1.8 trillion by 2020. Dabur made its first foreign acquisition in 2010 by buying Hobi Kozmetik Group, a leading personal care products company in Turkey, for $69 million. It also acquired US-based Namaste Laboratories for $100 million in the same year. Our twin acquisitions took place almost a decade after our entry into the overseas markets and these acquisitions have helped us further consolidate our overseas business. We have emerged as the Indian-born FMCG transnational entirely through the organic route, says Malhotra. Prior to these acquisitions, the company primarily sold hair oil under Dabur Amla and Vatika brands in the overseas markets. Now, its international portfolio is dominated by products it got from acquisitions. According to Citi Research, hair oil accounted for about 39% of sales from international markets together, followed by shampoo (14%), hair cream (13%), oral care (11%), skin care (7%) and styling products (about 12%) in FY16, contrary to hair oil contributing about 93% to the business in FY06.Namaste business has been steady and we believe local manufacturing and distribution in Africa should provide a fillip to the business from 2017 onwards. Local manufacturing would enhance the price competitiveness of Namaste products that are currently imported and thus at a significant price premium. Steps to enhancing sales and distribution for Namaste products in sub-Saharan Africa should help Dabur deepen its presence. For the other overseas operations, management talks of a somewhat lower adverse forex impact vs the previous year. Geopolitical or economic issues in Saudi Arabia and parts of North Africa remain, but the companys foray into Iran could be a new positive driver from second half of FY17, Citi Research said in the 21 September report.Going forward, Dabur will deepen presence in many of the countries in Africa, primarily where it already has presence, and across markets in South Asia. Two markets where it sees a better future are Myanmar and Iran. The company already has a presence in Myanmar, and it is setting up a factory in Iranprobably the last big market thats left unexplored due to blockadeto start selling products early next year.We are open to exploring inorganic opportunities to fill gaps in our existing portfolio and geographic presence, says Malhotra, adding that the company has not earmarked any amount for buys and can fund acquisitions through internal accruals and debt. Sachdev of UBS Securities, however, says there is risk in the international business. Theres also sub-scale which hinders their ability to generate quicker higher returns, she adds.Analysts darlingCompetition may be stiff and growth may be slow but Dabur India is considered an attractive investment proposition in consumer staples by equity analysts.Over FY16-18, noted Morgan Stanley in its report on 25 April, Dabur will become the most expensive staples stock from one of the cheapest now. It added, Even as the stock has outperformed the Sensex by 6% over the past six months, it has underperformed peers like Godrej Consumer Products Ltd, HUL and Marico Ltd by 10-30% on concerns of rising competition, especially from Patanjali Ayurved.Brokerage firm CLSA, in a report on 29 April, noted that the Dabur stock was up 11% in the past three months and it will continue to outperform as growth visibility is improving.",2016-10-23,UgUhTXwedPBnKgK0sgqIiO,"Feeling the heat from Baba Ramdevs Patanjali Ayurved, Dabur returns to its roots: Ayurveda ",23:42,Dabur goes back to basics to take on Patanjali
-0.31,"It was on a late July flight home to Singapore when Anthony Tan grasped the enormity of news that his biggest ally, Didi Chuxing, was about to buy out arch-rival Ubers Chinese business.
				   
				The stunned Grab co-founder knew better than to celebrate the vanquishing of an enemy. Unfettered by a costly battle for China, the worlds most valuable startup would now pivot to his Southeast Asian backyard. And with Didi and Uber Technologies Inc. taking stakes in each other, it spelled trouble for a global alliance forged to keep the US ride-hailing giant in check.Distraught, he took to his laptop and spent the next hour hammering out a rallying cryand warningto his 1,500 employees. Sure enough, soon after the deal, his American rival began redeploying resources and engineers to markets from India to Latin America, while rolling out new features and services from Singapore to Hanoi.There are times you just go, its time to rise up, said Tan, a 34-year-old whos fond of quoting the Bible and likens Grab to David facing an Uber-Goliath. For Tan, the climax of that Old Testament story wasnt the battle itself but when the little guy walked down the battlefield towards his giant adversary. That takes real courage, the Malaysian-born chief executive officer added in his first major interview in a year. The battle is already won if you can get to the battlefield.The mission statement penned at 30,000 feet was a rare display of emotion for a man whose ultra-competitiveness lurks just beneath an unflappable demeanor, according to friends. He responded to Ubers deal by clinching $750 million from investors led by SoftBank Group Corp.a record for a Southeast Asian tech startup. That money will bankroll Tans newest endeavor: GrabPay, a mobile payments service that could set it apart in a region where about 90% of transactions take place with cash.Anthony hates losing, said Chua Kee Lock, CEO of Vertex Ventures, the venture arm of Singaporean state-owned investment company Temasek Holdings Pte and Grabs first institutional investor.Its unclear how the alliance between Grab, Didi, Lyft Inc. and Indias Ola will proceed. Jean Liu, Didis president, told a summit in San Francisco the company is a big believer in leveraging the knowledge and strengths of local players. Her company is said to have been in talks to join Grabs last round of funding, though that investment never got nailed down even as other backers were announced. No ones suggesting the quartet is breaking up and Tan said the four founders remain close and still share information, but had no immediate plans to hook up their networks. Were not launching any time soon, Tan said of global roaming. Frankly, for us, we are just focused on our local stuff.Grab will take on Uber solo if needed. Its already dispatched a clutch of rivals en route to expanding across 31 cities in six countries since its 2012 inception in a Kuala Lumpur warehouse. Uber is active in just 16 Southeast Asian cities. According to App Annie, Grab topped app downloads in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam in the third quarter. Uber led in Singapore and Malaysia, Grabs home turf.Weve charted our journey to be alone, Tan said. Didi did whatever it takes to win. In our case, we will do whatever it takes to win.Problem is, hes now facing a $69 billion behemoth thats raised over $16 billion to date. Grab, in contrast, is said to be worth little more than $3 billion after raising a cumulative $1.45 billion. Uber is growing strongly and sustainably across Southeast Asia, which is a major focus for the company, Uber said in an e-mail to Bloomberg.Tan, whose great-grandfather was a taxi driver, got the inspiration to start Grab during his days at Harvard Business School. He quit the family business in Malaysia, Tan Chong Motor Holdings Bhd., in 2012 and started a taxi-hailing service then known as MyTeksi with his Harvard classmate Tan Hooi Ling. On a recent afternoon at Grabs Singapore offices, Tan talked about his vision and the hectic pace he sustains. Constant travel has taken a toll: perched on a silver gym ball to ease the pressure on his back, his fingers were covered with blisters from hand-foot-and-mouth disease, a viral infection.Yet he grows energized when talking about Grabs future. Tans priority now is building GrabPay into a regional mobile wallet and payments service to hook users and drivers without credit cards. We really believe that GrabPay will change the game.This year, it teamed up with Ant Financial to allow Chinese travelers visiting Singapore and Thailand to pay for rides through Alipay. Customers can now hook up their Citibank credit cards to GrabPay to pay for rides with points. In Indonesia, it partnered with PT Bank Mandiri to offer a mobile wallet service, and it struck an agreement with Lippo Group to let shoppers use its app to pay at the conglomerates department stores, cinemas and coffee shops. All thats intended to further Grabs ambition of becoming a consumer internet company that just happens to offer rides.We are creating the BAT of Southeast Asia, Tan said, referring to Chinas triumvirate of Baidu Inc., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. The next generation of great Internet companies in Southeast Asia will come from Grab if we get it right.Tan isnt the only one gambling against Uber: his backers include state investment firms Temasek and China Investment Corp., as well as Tiger Global Management. The grandson of Tan Yuet Foh, who co-founded an auto sales-and-assembly empire, is driven by a desire to forge his own legacy. Jixun Foo, managing partner at backer GGV Capital, recalled how Tan once took responsibility for a poor hiring decision he had little to do with.You could always blame someone, but he took it on himself, said Foo, who sits on the board. And he has a very strong desire to prove himself.For now, Grab is fighting it out in a Southeast Asian ride-hailing market with some 620 million people, forecast to grow more than five times to $13 billion by 2025. But its been a topsy-turvy journey, replete with stunners like Ubers capitulation.Its like Korean drama, Tan joked, invoking a genre known for its twists and turns and themes of revenge, betrayal and power. Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma put it best during a recent conversation, he said.He said, You know Anthony, life is a tsunami. When youre up on a tsunami, get ready for the crash. When you are at the bottom, get ready for the next wave. Bloomberg",2016-11-03,Uja0nuAahjJC8BalczupgK,"Grab is fighting it out in a Southeast Asian ride-hailing market with some 620 million people, forecast to grow more than five times to $13 billion by 2025",22:48,Grab CEO braces for a fight of Biblical proportions with Uber
0.98,"One of the authors of this article built a speech recognition engine in the early 1990s. It was built on a special purpose digital signal processor, in a lab that was especially dedicated to this project. The engine required two days of training, could recognize a single voice and had a vocabulary of close to 50 words. It was close to state-of-the-art at that time. 
Cut to the present. All smartphones today have the ability to recognize speech. No special hardware is needed. Training needs are minimalthe technology works straight out of the box and can be trained to recognize anybodys voice. And the vocabulary is infinite. The phenomenon that enabled this rapid change is the advancement in processing power, storage and communication. Computing speed is doubling every year, as per Moores law, which predicted an exponential growth in the number of transistors in integrated circuits within processors. Similar stories of transformation can be told about storage and communication. Todays technology road maps have gone beyond the classical Moores law with the advent of distributed computing, rapid development of smart devices packed with sensors and the Internet of things.While we have seen a lot of technology transformations over the last 20 years, what is even more fascinating is the expectation that the next two decades will see technology innovations being rolled out at a faster pace than ever before. Technological change will continue to be exponential. Noted inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil argues that there is even an exponential growth in the rate of exponential growth! What this means is that in the 21st century, we wont see a 100 years of technological progress. We will see 20,000 years of progress at todays rate.FIVE BIG TECHNOLOGY THEMES FOR THE FUTUREWhile there are many technological advancements taking place all around us, we think five big themes will play a very important role in defining the next 20 years.Gene is the new Byte: In the grand scheme of things, we are all very similar. In fact, 99.9% of our genes are identical. Its the last 0.1% that makes all the difference! In April 2003, the human genome was completely mapped for the first time. The rate of reduction in the cost to sequence a persons genome has outpaced even Moores law, from $10 million in 2008 to just $1,000 today. Going forward, this cost is likely to continue dropping and in the near future, we would be able get our complete genome mapped and stored in USB drives or on the cloud for a mere $100. This will open the doors to fantastic possibilities for preventive healthcare and personalized medical treatment. Genome mapping has large implications for agriculture as well, with possibilities like the development of more productive and disease resistant crops, or the creation of diet plans tailored to suit our respective heredities!Disruptions in energy: The end of energy as we know is near. Advancements in technology have reduced the cost of solar energy to 45 cents a watt from $100 a watt in 1970. Interestingly, during this period, other forms of energy have seen a 16-fold increase in price. The average cost of solar panels fell by 75% between 2009 and 2014, and is expected to decline by another 25% by 2018. Solar power tariffs are expected to reach grid parity in India in 2018, and then go below that level. Battery technology is advancing rapidly to help store this energy. Polymer and hybrid-flow battery technology being developed currently will increase energy density, increasing the storage capacity of a given physical space. It is likely that in the near future, many of us will be able to generate, store and use clean solar energy right off our rooftops, at a cost cheaper than buying electricity from the grid. With smart micro-grids, one will even be able to sell excess energy back, creating a truly distributed energy network.Advancements in material science: In Star Trek, the science fiction television show, the crew on-board starships used food replicators to synthesize any meal they wanted while travelling through space. This surreal concept is now inching towards reality. 3D printers have come a long way since the 1980s, and are soon going to be affordable enough for educational and residential usage. Nanomaterials with unique optical, electronic and mechanical properties are driving the next generation of consumer electronics, filtration systems and biomedical treatment. Similarly, advances in biodegradable plastics augur well for environmentally friendly packaging in the future. Ubiquitous digital connectivity: Ubiquitous digital connectivity has been elusive so far although it has been widely talked about by policymakers and technologists. But it is inevitable. Digital access will become more and more affordable as prices reduce. Consumers will increasingly bracket digital connectivity among needs as basic as roti, kapda and makaan (bread, clothes and home), and will allocate a larger share of wallet for it. Digital governance platforms will help governments significantly improve the distribution of subsidy programmes targeted at people with limited means and lastly, corporates that stand to benefit heavily from a burgeoning consumer class may make the economic trade-offs differently. AI and robotics revolution: Artificial intelligence (AI) is already a reality today with Google Search, Siri and IBM Watson being some examples. Todays AI tools excel at complex analytics. In 2016, AI mastered Go, widely considered the most difficult strategy game. However, it struggles with cognitive tasks that a two-year-old can dofor example, knowing the difference between the pictures of a cat and a dog. Genetic algorithms being developed today will strengthen AIs cognitive reasoning capabilities. Limitations on raw computational power will soon be overcome, powering AI tools to do what human brains can. Meanwhile, rapid advances in robotics, such as the development of bio-hybrid robots built using living tissue, are starting to take shape. We are on the cusp of an explosion in AI and robotics, which could make androids a reality in the near future.The interplay between these technology megatrends has the potential to significantly change the world as we know it today. Imagine solar energy-powered 3D printers being airlifted to disaster zones to provide food to people trapped there. Or, a mother in Salem, Tamil Nadu, getting her sons genome mapped, and later getting on a video conference with a New York-based doctor to seek allergy treatment options.Fundamental paradigm shifts driven by accelerating technologyChange in technology fundamentally shifts the production possibility frontier. Every time we hit the law of diminishing returns, newer technology provides a breakthrough. In addition to fundamental shifts in the cost curvewhich are a giventechnology expands the gamut of the possible by significantly altering core trade-offs. Let us look at three conventional business and economic trade-offs, which are getting busted:Two-way real-time interactions versus one-way outreach: In the past, businesses could either focus on rich information tailored to a niche market or reach out to a larger market that sacrificed richness for the additional reach. However, today, two-way, real-time communication with rich and relevant content has become a reality. Digital technology enables access to global platforms for buying and selling, marketing and financing from anywhere. Advanced analytics, combined with mobile technology, is allowing companies to target each consumer individually, across their entire client base. For example, if it is raining, your regular coffee shop can tempt you to brave the weather and visit it by offering you a promotional scheme on your favourite drink, through an app on your smartphone.Supply and demand mismatch: With the shift towards elimination of bespoke hardware, and value migrating to software, it is possible today to match supply with demand almost perfectly. Increased access and connectivity via technology is driving a revolution in the sharing economy as well. Sharing is not new to us. The barter system has been in place for centuries, long before money was invented. Today, we are not only sharing digital information, we are also sharing physical things like homes and vehicles with each other, using digital market places.Scale versus cost: Technology is not only rapidly reducing servicing costs, it is also increasingly enabling businesses to move to an opex spend model, from the erstwhile capex heavy approach. This is helping expand firms reach to new consumers at a faster rate than ever before. For example, consumers with very low deposits can be served economically in an opex spend model, telecom base stations no longer need minimum efficient scale, retail distribution can be customized economically at a micro-market level, and 3D printing can significantly change manufacturing scale. SPECIFIC IMPLICATIONS OF ACCELERATING TECHNOLOGY FOR INDIARadical innovation with next-generation technology architecture:The Internet has served as the main platform for disruption across industries. Its architecture is decentralized, modular and stacked. Lower down the stack, the focus is on scale and efficient utilization, for example, server capacity. Higher up the stack, however, the focus is on content related to user needs and innovation. This stack-based architecture eliminates the trade-off between efficiency and innovation, as higher-layer innovators can rent scale from lower-level platform providers to conduct experiments at lower costs. This is already a reality in our lives. Case in point, Uber, which uses a stacked architecture comprising GPS, Google Maps, electronic payments and connected smartphonesnone of which it ownsto offer a disruptive and consumer-friendly transportation solution.In India, we are witnessing the rising usage of a similar stacked architecture, called the India Stack, in the financial services sector. Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar and mobile phones have created a fundamental layer of customer identification and access, on which multiple digital transactions can be built. This has the potential to solve our financial inclusion problem by eliminating the classical roadblocks of paper-based identity proofs, interaction with a physical bank and the availability of hard cash. The entire stack is an open resource, which means anyone can access and leverage it. A similar open stack architecture is being used by the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) to provide a platform for tax data management and reporting. The platform will provide the plumbing to bring together all GSTN stakeholders including taxpayers, banks, and central and state governments to completely transform Indias tax landscape.This is paradigm shift in technology architecture where innovation happens at the bottom of the stack and is available as a public good at a very low cost to everybody. The implications of this shift are quite profound and if deployed well can be used to address some of our very core socio-economic challenges.Ability to address Indias chronic challenges: Healthcare is one of the most complex challenges of our time, with the infrastructure and capital required to fix the problems and reduce the inequity in healthcare access being insufficient so far. Despite making progress over the last decade, India accounts for a disproportionate percentage of global incidences of disease. We have seven doctors for every 10,000 people, which is only half the average global doctor-patient ratio. Large-scale change is never easy, but technology holds extraordinary promise in helping address our healthcare challenges.By leveraging the technology stack already in placewide connectivity through mobile phones and high-speed data networks, Aadhaar, digitization of health recordswe can significantly improve every element of our health system, from education for prevention, to treatment and management. Big Data and analytics can fundamentally alter healthcare delivery and transform our public health and medical research initiatives through the establishment of national registries. India can become data-rich very rapidly. And a nationwide, connected, many-to-many health information highway with common data standards and interoperability features can just be what the doctor ordered! A similar approach can also be deployed in critical areas such as education and skilling, and it can fundamentally transform how India teaches and learns.Enabling organizations to be trailblazers: Historically, Indian firms have found it hard to address the challenges of low average purchasing power, lack of minimum efficient scale and widespread socio-economic inequity. With the acceleration of technology, these challenges get decimated. Acceleration in technology, coupled with relatively lower legacy investments, gives Indian firms the opportunity to leapfrog their peers to become global trailblazers. Technology makes investments modular, reducing capital outlays and experimentation costs, while increasing speed and agility, which are critical advantages in todays dynamic macroeconomic environment. There is every reason to believe that the next Alibaba, Amazon, Google, Tesla or Uber can emerge out of India.GOING FORWARD, WE NEED TO ADDRESS THREE KEY AREAS TO UNLOCK THIS TECHNOLOGY REVOLUTION1. How do we ensure sufficient investment in infrastructure at the lower level of the stack?Private returns on infrastructure investments are often substantially lower than the underlying social benefits generated. While benefits accrue to the economy at large through positive externalities, this does not assure returns for the infrastructure investor. Also, when infrastructure investment requires an entirely new generation of expensive technology, such as fibre, 4G or 5G, it can compound market failure. The government, through policy formulation, has a key role to play in encouraging sufficient investment in infrastructure.2. What changes should be make in our education system to equip our youth for the technology revolution?There is a need to rethink technology and vocational skills being imparted at higher education institutions. Future jobs will be very different from those in the market today. In addition to solving the existing challenges our education system faces, we need to ensure that it equips our youth with the necessary multidisciplinary skills to meet the needs of tomorrow. 3. How do we drive collaboration across stakeholders to unlock the full potential of technology-enabled transformation?The government, large corporates, start-ups and NGOs have different strengths and capabilities. There is a need to draw upon the expertise of all these stakeholders, and marrying together their complementary skills. We need the right policies and construct for public-social-private partnerships to make this happen.In summary, technological change is accelerating at an unprecedented pace and will change the world as we know it.

0.38,"New Delhi: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) spending by Indian companies saw a sharp increase in FY16, according to a report released on Monday by CRISIL Foundationthe philanthropic arm of credit-rating company CRISIL.
				   
				The report analysed 1,505 companies out of the 4,887 BSE-listed firms that qualify for CSR spending under the CSR Rules, which came into force on 1 April 2014. The rules direct all companies with a net worth of Rs500 crore or revenue of Rs1,000 crore or net profit of Rs5 crore to spend 2% of their average profit in the past three years on social development.The report shows an increase in the number of firms that are in compliance with CSR Rules and thus the rise in spending, as Mint reported earlier.ALSO READ:  Firms ramp up CSR focus on healthcare, poverty, hungerThe report states that the key focus areas of CSR spending in FY16 were education, skill development, healthcare and sanitationsimilar to those seen among the top 100 National Stock Exchange firms last year in September.CRISIL Foundations analysis shows overall spending increased by a significant 22%, with the bulk of the funds going to education, skill development, healthcare and sanitation initiatives. Average spending rose 29 basis points to 1.64% as compared with 1.35% in FY15, the report said. In absolute terms, the total money spent rose by Rs2,500 crore to Rs8,300 crore in FY16. There were two reasons for the 22% jump in adherence by the larger companiesfirms are overcoming the challenge of large-scale interventions, which takes more time and effort, and they are using implementing agencies, mainly non-governmental organisations, for execution, suggests the report.Among the trend shifts between FY15 and FY16 is the focus of firms on ensuring impact. Ashu Suyash, managing director and CEO, CRISIL suggests that firms are looking to make a difference as a shift was seen towards outcome-based projects in FY16. This is indeed the way to go, as underlined by the Effective Altruism movement worldwide where, instead of doing what feels right, (companies) find the best causes to work on by using empirical evidence and analysis, he says.FY16 was the second year of the CSR Rules being in force and 1,505 companies of the 4,887 listed on the BSE, qualified for CSR spending. Of these, 77%, or 1,158 companies, reported their CSR activities, compared with 1,024 companies, or 75% of the 1,300 eligible in FY15.The higher spend is being seen as a positive step towards increasing private sector involvement in social development.Ramraj Pai, president, CRISIL Foundation, says, The public-private complementarity is great to see because, as a percentage of total government expenditure, India spends significantly less than what other BRICS nations do. So the private sector ramping up where government spending is low is truly synergistic CSR.",2017-01-31,VBRqDSfkqBfq4b8u5i9S4N,"CRISIL Foundations analysis shows overall spending increased by 22%, with the bulk of the funds going to education, skill development, healthcare and sanitation initiatives",01:34,Indian companies CSR spending up in 2015-16: Report
1.0,"Sequoia, like Mint, completed 10 years in India recently. A decade is a long time. Long enough, perhaps, to look beyond the vagaries of short-term investment sentiment. In the last four years, there have been swings in expectations on how Indias technology story will unfold. 2014 and 2015 were characterized by much optimism, strong capital flows, exuberance in valuations and extravagance in company building. 2016 was a year in which companies strengthened their business foundations. But it was also a year of uncertainty and diminished expectations in the community.
				   
				Clouded by such recent history, we often under-appreciate the changes that have taken place over the last decade and underestimate ones which could pan out over the next one. Compare 2006 to 2016and you would realize that we have come a long way, both as an economy and as a tech ecosystem. A decade ago, Indian companies had a market perhaps half to one-thirtieth of the current one, depending on the sector. Venture capital was scarce and only those with inherited wealth were able to start businesses requiring capital. Even till 2010-11, when I founded a company, few people had Internet, even fewer had smartphones and there was no easy way of distributing technology to consumers. What a transformation a decade can unleash. Now, project the growth of the past decade on the next one and the market will be strikingly larger and more attractive for entrepreneurs starting businesses today. At Sequoia, we are excited about helping build technology companies which will serve this market across sectors. We are also hopeful that a few trends will pan out over the next decadeBusinesses will be built with better capital efficiencyIn recent times, Indian tech start-ups have taken significant capital to build  businesses. The biggest eight Indian private Internet companies have raised over $8 billion (around Rs55,000 crore) between them. We believe this will change going forward. Companies of the last decade found an ecosystem where they had to do much on their own. For e-commerce companies, this included their own warehousing, logistics and payments. There were no quality partners. Often, supply quality was poor, so marketplaces had to be full stack to provide a good customer experience. We also saw exceptional competitive intensity, fuelled in some cases by an oversupply of capital and in others by the entry of global players. This increased customer acquisition costs. The partner ecosystem is far better now, the base supply is improving and, as more differentiated business models emerge, competitive intensity and oversupply of capital is reducing. We are already seeing examples of thisVoonik, for instance, took far less capital than Myntra did to build a similar-sized fashion marketplace, thanks to a lighter operating model and outsourced logistics. With these, and the efficacy of engineering, product and sales teams going up with a maturing employee base, companies of the next decade should be more capital-efficient.Newer business models will emerge in existing categories Often entrepreneurs consider a category out of bounds for new businesses because of the presence of an incumbent. We think that a category is never taken and there is always scope for a new player to disrupt existing ones with a superior operating model. For instance, the C2C product commerce space has well-funded and large incumbents such as Quikr and Olx. But Zefo was still able to break into this market by providing a superior customer experience with a different operating model and instilling trust between the buyer and the seller. We expect more of this to happen in the coming decade.More and more sectors of the indian economy will be rebuilt by tech companies As a start-up ecosystem, we are playing in a canvas that covers a small fraction of Indias gross domestic product (GDP). Increasingly, we meet tech start-ups solving problems in sectors considered conventionally unattractive for venture investors. For instance, media, logistics and warehousing. Several sectors have incumbents which have done a poor job of customer service. Over time, most of them would become addressable to tech entrepreneurs and new companies will be built with a tech core, superior customer focus and stronger management. If you are an entrepreneur starting a business today, whats up for grabs is not just the digital market but the next decades $5 trillion Indian economy.With larger and more accessible markets, improving capital efficiency, more sectors of the economy becoming addressable and companies increasingly going after global markets, each year of tech investing in India looks incrementally better. At Sequoia, we wake up every morning excited about the future, and about partnering with entrepreneurs who will shape it.

				SpiceJets shares had declined about 14% till Tuesday since IndiGo announced its results on 1 August. But SpiceJets June quarter performance changed the trend. Its share price closed 16% higher on Wednesday.To be sure, its not as if SpiceJets fares havent declined. They did, by 3% year-on-year. But this decline was smaller than expected. In comparison, IndiGos average fare had declined 11%. Further, a combination of 37% increase in capacity, an impressive 92.5% load factor and 64% growth in ancillary revenue helped SpiceJets revenue grow 37% to Rs.1,521 crore, according to Kiran Koteshwar, chief financial officer of SpiceJet. Ancillary revenue includes ticket cancellation charges, excess baggage fees, sales of on-board meals, etc.Of course, the lower fuel cost environment helped. Fuel costs as a percentage of revenues declined to 26% from 32% last year though the measure was higher sequentially. But SpiceJets cost per available seat kilometre, or CASK, excluding fuel costs increased 3%. That was on account of the rupees depreciation and a general inflationary pressure, said Koteshwar.Overall operating costs grew at a relatively slower pace than revenues. As a result, operating profit and Ebitdar increased 53% and 57%, respectively, to Rs.192 crore and Rs.451.8 crore. Ebitdar stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and lease rentals. SpiceJets Ebitdar margin came in at 30%, representing an increase over the June 2015 quarter. In comparison, IndiGos Ebitdar margin had declined year-on-year to 33% last quarter.Flat depreciation costs and a decline in finance costs helped SpiceJets net profit more than double to Rs.149 crore. From here on, the outlook really depends on whether the airline can put up such a stellar show on a consistent basis. Domestic passenger growth remains strong.

-0.39,"New Delhi/ Mumbai:  Explorers in the worlds fastest-growing oil market are seeking lower taxes on crude produced from local fields to encourage fresh drilling as India tries to reduce its dependence on energy imports.
				   
				State-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) and the biggest private producer Cairn India Ltd. want finance minister Arun Jaitley to at least halve the cess on crude oil production in the Union budget due 1 February. India surprised some explorers last year with its 20% ad-valorem tax on every ton of crude produced locally, moving from a fixed charge. Companies pay more now with crude near $50 a barrel than they did under the old system when it was double the price.Globally, given the low oil price scenario, governments have provided incentives to stimulate and attract investments, said Sudhir Mathur, interim chief executive officer at Cairn India. In India, the cess rate of 20% acts as a disincentive to increase production and commit incremental investments.Attracting investments to boost output from local fields is key for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has made energy security a priority and set a target of cutting oil imports by 10% in the next five years. Reducing the levy will help explorers including ONGC and Cairn India, which oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan estimates will spend $25 billion by the end of this decade. Indias hydrocarbon resources are highly undeveloped and production has been declining for the past several years, prompting the government to nudge companies to invest in reversing the fall and increase energy supplies.New Delhi-based ONGC is spending over $5 billion for its biggest development plan in a deep-sea block in the Bay of Bengal off the countrys east coast. Cairn India also plans to spend as much as $4 billion over the next few years to drill for oil.Asias third-largest economy meets about 80% of its crude oil requirements through imports.We need some money to be left behind so that we are able to flow back into the investment cycle, said A.K. Srinivasan, finance director at ONGC, the nations biggest explorer.Otherwise there will be cash shortage. Already, we are going to run cash shortages.At a price of $55 a barrel, ONGC may have to pay about $11 as cess, compared with $9 when prices were $100 a barrel and the tax was fixed charge, he said. With crude prices firming up, the cost impact of this tax is quite high.Brent oil prices have risen about 17% since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) agreed in November to cut production for six months starting in January. The fuel traded above $100 as recently as September 2014.Firming crude prices may also allow the government to reduce the levy on retail prices for gasoline and diesel, according to Dhaval Joshi, an analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd.India didnt pass on to consumers the entire benefit of crudes price decline from July 2014, increasing excise duty on the two fuels nine times and mopping up about Rs960 billion ($14 billion) in the previous two fiscal years.The government may now look at easing prices as one way of cushioning the impact of its 8 November ban on high-denomination currency notes, which impacted the rural population the most, as it prepares for five state elections this quarter. The consumer price of diesel, the most-used fuel in the country, is at a record while that of gasoline is at the highest since August 2014, according to state-run fuel retailer Indian Oil Corp.s (IOL) website.

0.7,"The fact that IndusInd Bank shares have easily beaten the sector indices in terms of gains over the last six weeks should not be a surprise anymore. The private sector lenders results for the September quarter showed enough improvement to cheer investors, starting with a net profit growth of 26% to Rs704.25 crore and an all-time high net interest margin of 4%.
				   
				Since 1 September, its shares have risen 3.19% while banking indices fell by 2%. Clearly, the run-up to its results release has been in anticipation of stellar numbers.What makes IndusInd Bank such an attraction for investors?Besides an improvement in its net interest margin for the eighth straight quarter, the bank reported a loan growth of 26% and said the growth emerges primarily from its high-yielding retail portfolio. This, along with an improving low-cost current account and savings proportion of deposits, has added 12 basis points to the margins during the quarter. A basis point is 0.01%.The 22-year-old lenders net interest income clocked a growth of 33% to Rs1,460.31 crore while non-interest income grew by 24% to Rs1,094.28 crore.An efficient lender is often rewarded, especially in the banking sector awash with inefficiency in both lending and cost management. IndusInd Bank continued to maintain the health of its loan book with asset quality metrics largely unchanged. Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) as a percentage of total loans stood at 0.91% at the end of the September quarter, little changed from the previous quarter. But gross NPAs rose 4.4% sequentially to Rs899 crore at the end of September because of one account, said the management.A diversified loan book, growing low cost deposits and a steady asset quality puts IndusInd Bank in a sweet spot. But at a price-to-book value of 4.2 times earnings of FY16, is it too hot to handle? Analysts have recommended a buy rating even at these valuations.Here is a thread of caution. The lender was expecting relief from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on its exposure to Food Corporation of India. RBI had mandated all banks to make 15% provisioning against this exposure. This shows up in the 35% jump in the provisions of IndusInd Bank.

-1.0,"Through the second half of 2012, guilt was a constant companion for this Delhi-based entrepreneur. Two years after she had co-founded a higher education venture, disagreements with her partners over equity stake were threatening to derail the business.  
				   
				She had a 25% equity in the venture that was founded to meet the demand for talented analysts and accounting professionals in the financial services sector. The full-time, one-year programme was essentially a combination of the chartered financial analyst and certified financial planner courses.The institute had managed to get 19 students in the first year and ensure their placements in firms like HDFC Life and ICICI Bank . Thanks to a strong buzz, the student intake for the second batch had increased rapidly. Fifty students signed up for the Rs.2.4 lakh course. But troubles were round the corner. The entrepreneur recalls that some of the key mistakes of the co-founders, including herself, were losing sight of the monthly expenses and the heavy toll the years marketing budget (Rs.45 lakh) took. By then, she had invested  Rs.12 lakh, a part of which had come from her husband and in-laws, in the venture. Her partners, who used to run another educational institute in Mumbai, refused to increase their stake. Together, they couldnt agree on a third partner who could infuse the capital needed. In June 2012, the founding team decided to call it quits, after investing about Rs.1 crore in the venture. Fortunately, the second batch had cleared the programme by then. When you run an educational institution, the most guilt is towards the students. Its not great to have the name of an institute that doesnt exist any more on your CV, says the entrepreneur. Failed ventures can come swift and strong in the world of entrepreneurship. As the conversation around several prominent and hyper-valued start-ups, especially in segments such as food technology, real estate and e-commerce, has turnedwith fewer stories of growth and more stories of layoffs, big-bang implosions seem more real than ever. Last month, for example, I happened to visit the building in Noida, adjoining Delhi, that used to house the headquarters of AskMe, a consumer Internet search platform. Four thousand people had lost their jobs in August alone. Earlier, the building would have been abuzz with young people swarming the lobby area and spilling out on to the pavements for cigarette breaks. This time, there was an eerie silence. Ironically, in the ecosystem of lavishly funded start-ups, the sting of failure seems to have lost some of its stigma. Earlier, the fear of failure stopped people from becoming entrepreneurs. Today, however, failure is accepted as being necessary on the route to success in business. In a culture like ours, which is averse to risks, it is probably even useful. Contemporary business literature is full of inspiring quotes about failure. Yet the business utility of failure conceals the personal cost. No quote on failure really justifies the experience, founders have told me. What do failures scabs and wounds look like? Are they like that forgotten hairline fracture that tingles with pain at the onset of winter? Or more like an open wound, infected with painful memories? Guilttowards ones family, employees who get left in the lurch, and early supporters who backed the ventureis often the most vicious monster. In the end, though, it doesnt kill you, says a Mumbai-based entrepreneur, with more than a hint of irony. Hes on to his third entrepreneurial venture nowthe earlier two folded up. There is an intense need to cry and lock yourself in for some time. Friends and family, though they mean well, cant really help. Its lonely.  Surviving Start-ups focuses on the stories of the people (parents, siblings, spouses and friends) who make up an entrepreneurs world.

0.85,"Mumbai: Initial public offerings (IPOs) of private equity-backed companies that have inked profit-sharing agreements may face hurdles with the markets regulator making it mandatory for listed companies to disclose and seek shareholders approval for all such agreements.
				   
				Profit-sharing or upside-sharing agreements between promoters, key managerial personnel and private equity investors are signed to encourage promoters or key employees to meet an agreed target. These agreements are often linked to the internal rate of return (IRR) that the private equity investor makes at the time of exit.While the Sebi amendment in January ostensibly applies only to listed companies to check possible instances of violations of corporate governance norms, it could have implications for IPO-bound companies, according to legal experts.While the market regulator seems to be concerned of a possible conflict of interest of promoters or management teams taking measures to ensure stock appreciation in anticipation of higher profit sharing with an investors exit from a listed company, it needs to be seen how Sebi will practically apply provisions of this amendment to unlisted companies which may have upside sharing arrangements at the time of listing and exit post listing, said Aakash Choubey, a partner at law firm Khaitan and Co.After seeking public comments, Sebi approved an amendment on 23 November to Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements Regulations 2015. The amendment was notified on 4 January.Significantly, a Sebi show-cause notice in November last year asked PVR Ltd to explain a profit-sharing deal struck by its promoters with private equity investors that was not disclosed to its shareholders. The notice pointed to the violation of two norms: one related to a code of conduct for all board members and senior management and another to disclosure of events and information which are material.According to the amendment, new upside-sharing agreements between an employee, including key managerial personnel or a director or promoter, and a shareholder or third party would require prior approval from the board of the listed company and shareholders of the listed company through an ordinary resolution.Additionally, to remain valid and enforceable, existing agreements as on 4 January are required to be approved at the next meeting of the board and, thereafter, by the public shareholders of the listed company, the Sebi circular said. The circular does not explicitly mention how upside agreements in unlisted companies will be regulated on listing.The ambiguity is definitely going to cause some concern and confusion among private equity funds and promoters, said Nimesh Shah, managing director and co-founder of the Investment Banking Group at Nine Rivers Capital Advisors. Depending on what Sebi finally says on the matter, it could take away the incentive of listing a company altogether for PE investor, promoter or both in some cases, Shah added.While an email sent to Sebi remained unanswered at the time of going to press, a senior official at the watchdog, who did not want to be named, confirmed that the market regulator is in receipt of some representations on the applicability of the recent amendments on companies that are planning to list.As long as the companies make a disclosure in their IPO prospectus, they would be compliant with Sebi regulations. With full disclosure, the investors will be able to make an informed decision, the official said. Sebi will issue an FAQ (a list of frequently asked questions) to address these concerns, he added.deborshi.c@livemint.com",2017-01-30,W9VhqDUhorNokBJXXeBM7N,"While Sebis profit-sharing agreement norms apply only to listed companies to check for violations of corporate governance norms, it could have implications for IPOs as well",00:48,Profit-sharing agreement norms may be a hurdle for PE-backed firms IPO plans

A basic package runs about $2,000, which once rolled into a mortgage is pennies a month, according to spokesman Craig LeMessurier. Lennar builds the cost into the price of homes. The Alameda house sells for $1.2 million, though it was a beta model and an actual dwelling wouldnt include $30,000 worth of gadgets.Apple is also working with Brookfield Residential Properties Inc. and other builders.

Though thats a drop in the bucket compared with smartphones, the research and consulting firm expects those sales to nearly double by 2020.For most people, connected homes remain a ways off, said Jonathan Gaw, an analyst with research firm IDC. The proliferating devices remain difficult to install in older homes and, in some cases, seem useless. Gaw cites the wireless candle he saw the other day.Give me a break, he said. That only hurts the message. It tells people that we have gone too far.

At least, in theory, they do.Certain devices obey, and some do not, Giesler said.Homebuilders started offering smart devices such as automatic locks and thermostats more than five years ago. In its current model homes, Miami-based Lennar works with a company called Nexia, a unit of Ingersoll-Rand Plc.Lennars Kaiserman hopes working with Apple will have a halo effect, helping convince customers that a new home in a subdivision can be a cool alternative to an existing one.No doubt, Apple would be heartened by the experience of Ken Bieber. Last year, Bieber, a 39-year-old executive at a consulting firm, bought a $357,000 Lennar smart home after visiting a model north of Tampa, Florida.With his Nexia system, his lights automatically start dimming in the evening, signaling that its time to get ready for bed. When his wife, April, went into labor two months ago, he stayed with her in the hospital and texted a temporary entry code to a friend who walked the dog.Since buying his house, Bieber has spent another $1,000 for wireless motion detectors, a video camera and controls for his light dimmers, ceiling fans and irrigation system.Neighbors ask him for advice on their own smart home device purchases, and he plans to add motorized blinds. Ill be watching a movie and suddenly I have to get up and pull blinds -- apparently its just too much for me at that point, Bieber said. Im so used to saying things and they just happen. BloombergWith assistance from Alex Webb",2016-10-19,W9kvhREszSoZo4H8q8LS4L,"As iPhone sales growth slows, Apple is teaming up with a handful of builders to inch its way into the market for Internet-connected home furnishings",22:14,Apple wants to get inside your home before you even buy it

When Docomo decided to exercise the option in April 2014, there was no taker for the unprofitable operations, so the Tatas sought central bank permission to pay out the equivalent of Rs7,250 crore.By then, however, the Reserve Bank of India had a new set of rules that banned any exit by a foreign equity investor at an assured price. Still, the central bank, under Governor Raghuram Rajan, wanted to allow the payment because it was a question of an Indian company honouring an agreement, struck at a time when there was no clear law against options embedded in such an investment. Also, this clearly wasnt a case of foreign-currency debt masquerading as equity. How many creditors agree in advance to a 50% haircut after five years? Yet the Indian government, which had the final say, decided the Tatas shouldnt be allowed to pay Docomo.In January 2015, Docomo took the dispute to the London Court for International Arbitration. Last month, the court awarded the Japanese firm $1.17 billion (Rs7,840 crore at the current rate) in compensation from Tata Sons, the Indian conglomerates holding company.The saga should have ended there, except that:Bloomberg News reports that New Delhi intends to block the arbitration payment, too; Japans Nikkei says Docomo might ask a US court to seize Tata assets; The Financial Times has learned from a person close to Docomo that the Japanese company might seek enforcement action on Tata Groups British businesses; and The Tata Group is countering that the struggling Port Talbot steel plant in south Wales, as well as UK-based Jaguar Land Rover, are owned by Tata Steel and Tata Motors  theyre not Tata Sons properties. So the whole thing has become a spectacle. The Indian governments refusal to take a commonsense view of Docomos claim was a poor decision. New Delhi is now making bad judgment worse by threatening to block the arbitration award.Such actions have consequences. Not only has the governments pigheadedness created unnecessary risks for minority shareholders of publicly traded Tata Steel and Tata Motors, it has also cast doubts on Prime Minister Narendra Modis resolve to change investors experience of doing business in India.

1.0,"Jain Irrigation Systems Ltds fortunes are closely linked with the monsoon.
				   
				The poor rainfall last year took a toll on the companys micro-irrigation systems (MIS) business in fiscal 2016.The MIS business revenue declined 1.7% from a year earlier and accounted for 45% of consolidated revenue in FY16.However, if the monsoon rainfall is better this year, then the MIS business could well bounce back. Anil Jain, managing director, Jain Irrigation Systems, says the MIS business should register a 12-18% revenue growth this fiscal year. Of course, this depends on how good the monsoon actually turns out to be. Notably, Jain Irrigation shares have risen by around 37% from its lows in mid-February. Investors appear to be pricing in decent growth this year.Last year, while the domestic MIS business was weak, the revenue from the overseas business increased 4%. Commenting on the overseas business, Jain says: These countries did not have specific drought and we had strong growth in China and Latin America. Needless to say, if the MIS business bounces back, and the overseas business stays strong, Jain Irrigation will be in a sweet spot.There are other reasons to cheer as well. The consolidated net debt reduced by about 20% from December end to Rs.3,559 crore at the end of the March quarter. Jain expects a further reduction of Rs.300 crore this year, helped by stronger revenue and a reduction in working capital. That should bring down the net debt-to-equity ratio to 1 by FY17-end from 1.2 at the end of FY16. Naturally, this would lead to some relief on finance costs, which were as high as Rs.477 crore, or 58% of operating profit, last year.Over FY16 to FY18, Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd estimates 14% and 19% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) in revenue and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda), respectively. That should translate into a profit after tax of CAGR 93% to Rs.380 crore in FY18, mainly to factor in the lower interest outgo, according to the brokerage.Jain Irrigation shares trade at about 14 times this years estimated earnings. Sure, these valuations appear to be factoring in a good share of the optimism. But a higher government thrust on irrigation and a good monsoon season, along with an improvement in profitability aided by lower interest costs, could well offer some more room for valuations to expand.",2016-06-13,Wfy4rHUqMUHLO9PARjz1GJ,"If the micro-irrigation systems business bounces back, and the overseas business stays strong, Jain Irrigation will be in a sweet spot

0.76,"New Delhi: The annual Yes Bank Transformation Series in which Mint is a knowledge partner, is focused this year on innovation and impact as the key drivers of growth and productivity. Designing a solution to redefine Indias solar energy market to conceptualizing an ecosystem for Indias fintech start-ups or laying the road map for a cashless Indian economy, these are some of the case study challenges provided by this years contest for teams from B-schools in India and across the world.
				   
				Launched in 2010, the Yes Bank Transformation Series is a unique platform that offers students across the world an opportunity to work on real-life industry challenges faced by the financial sector and urges them to push the envelope, in a bid to transform Innovation to Impact. Over the years, the focus has been on various disruptive concepts such as digital financial inclusion and complete digitalization. So far, more than 35,000 students have participated in this challenge, making it Indias largest case study challenge.Rana Kapoor, managing director and chief executive of Yes Bank, said: At Yes Bank, it is our constant endeavour to interact with the young minds and channelize their entrepreneurial spirit in the right direction with an emphasis on Innovation. The Yes Bank Transformation Series is a great opportunity for aspiring students to put themselves in the shoes of business leaders, test their mettle against the world and showcase their innovative thinking. I strongly believe that this case study challenge will help us find the next big thinkers and innovators of the country.The Yes Bank Transformation Series is an attempt towards nurturing and promoting the talent inherent in the brightest young minds of the country, while also infusing the spirit of DICE: Design, Innovation and Creativity-led Entrepreneurship in them. The central idea is establishing a nationwide Innovation Lab that would create a sustained culture of growth, entrepreneurship and innovation in India. The challenge has seen the series climb new heights this year, with participation from more than 25,000 students across the top B-schools of India including Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ahmedabad; IIM, Calcutta; IIM, Lucknow; IIM, Indore; Indian School of Business (ISB), Hyderabad; Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT); National Institute of Industrial Engineering (NITIE), Mumbai; IIM, Kozhikode; and IIM, Shillong among others. In this edition, the Yes Bank Transformation Series has emerged as Indias largest case study challenge for B-school students. Using a mix of digital and social media and with a strong focus on innovation, the competition engaged with more than 300,000 students from across the world.Innovative use of social mediaOne of the unique aspects of the fifth edition of the Yes Bank Transformation Series was the innovative use of social and digital media to interact and engage with the student community. The core idea was to reach and engage young minds in the language they converse inat the places they frequent the mostsocial media.The campaign spread across Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn and helped facilitate interactions with more than 300,000 students across the world.Coming up on social mediaMeet your mentor: This will provide an opportunity for budding entrepreneurs to interact with the advisory council via Twitter chats and LinkedIn and get live answers to their queries.Innovation focus: An awareness campaign to highlight the key disruptive innovations in financial services industry that redefined the boundaries of the industry.Innovation Quiz: This quiz on disruptive innovation and the questions will focus solely around innovations which changed the facets of the industry in which they were conceived.Prelims of Edition V of Yes Bank Transformation Series: The preliminary round saw four diverse organizations addressing four key issues in the fintech space. Taisys Technologies, an organization which in collaboration with Yes Bank has created a unique solution which enables feature phone users to access essential banking services, T-Hub, Indias largest incubator, which is creating a comprehensive centre of excellence to accelerate and scale-up fintech start-ups with Yes Bank, Zaggle Prepaid Ocean Services Pvt. Ltd, a prepaid solution provider, and Ezetap Mobile Solutions Pvt. Ltd, one of the worlds largest mobile point of sale (m-PoS) solution providers, shared their challenges with students around the world.In this round, the top participating institutions were divided into four groups, each addressing one of the aforementioned case studies. Here is a bit about the case studies: TaisysThe case from Taisys focused on the Sim-Se-pay solution launched by Taisys with Yes Banka wafer-thin sticker which can be stuck on any type of SIM card of any telco service providerstandard, micro and nano. This sticker installs a sim tool kit-based app which can be accessed by the consumer on any mobile phone without the need for Internet connection.This Sim-Se-Pay wafer is linked to a prepaid wallet which can be loaded by the consumer to perform various types of transactions. The case challenged students to work on increasing commercial usages and socio-commercial usages of the SIM Sleeve and create a comprehensive marketing strategy for the same.T-HubThe second case focused on the unique public/private partnership between T-Hub, the government of Telangana, three of Indias premier academic institutes (IIIT-H, ISB and NALSAR) and key private sector leaders. It stands at the intersection of the start-up, academic, corporate, research and government sectors, and Yes Bank.In April 2016, Yes Bank signed a memorandum of understanding  with T-Hub to create a centre of excellence (CoE), to enable the Indian start-ups across segments with primary focus on fintech. This association will help create a conducive business environment and support system for a large number of fintech start-ups. In addition, Yes Bank will offer its various products and payment gateways and open application program interfaces (APIs) to the start-up community. This challenge tasked the worlds finest minds to create an innovation strategy to leverage the relationship between Yes Bank and T-Hub and to create a holistic innovation program for fintech start-ups, as well as to create a detailed marketing strategy and implementation programme to promote the CoE initiative in a cluttered and highly competitive market.Zaggle In case 3, the focus shifted to Zaggle one of Indias fastest growing prepaid card companies with over 1,000 corporates and 600,000 cards (Visa/Master/proprietary platform) in circulation.Yes Bank and Zaggle have entered into an association to offer prepaid cards to Yes Bank customers. Zaggle has aligned itself with Yes Bank as a total solution provider for its prepaid instruments services across India. This collaboration formally marked Zaggles first engagement with Yes Bank to issue prepaid gift cards and subsequently follow it up with other prepaid cards and allied products with respect to digital payments. This collaboration with Yes Bank would enable Zaggle to further cement its position as a leader in the digital payments space.The case challenged the students to device a cashless innovative pre-paid solution for individuals, giving employers a hassle free product construct and the recipient a potent solution with a wide bouquet of options along with a focused marketing strategy.EzetapThere has been much talk about the gradual shift to a cashless society and the fourth case in the Yes Bank Transformation Series focused on that. This case was shared by Ezetapthe fastest growing mPoS company in India today. Since launching in 2011, Ezetap has over 80,000 terminals deployed in the market, processing over $2.5 million in gross transaction value daily.Despite the phenomenal growth of mobile wallet and m-PoS providers in the country, there is a still major reliance on cash transactions (almost 94% transactions are cash-based). Bright young minds across the world were tasked with devising a strategic road map for Ezetap to tap this huge potential market (there is a potential of 19-20 million PoS  terminals in India while currently only around a million exist). Students were also advised to integrate the revolutionary UPIUnified Payment Interface technology.Campus connectAfter a gruelling opening round, the top five teams were identified by senior leaders from the partner organizations and Yes Bank leaders. The Yes Bank Transformation Series hosted campus challenges across the top 25 campuses in the country to identify the 15 finalist teams of the challenge. The campus round saw students ideas being judged on criteria such as research methodology, understanding of current regulatory framework, depth of analysis of core issues, innovation quotient, and feasibility of implementation and scalability.Apart from naming the winners and runners-up in the campus round, additional prizes were given away for the most innovative idea, most implementable solution, best marketing plan, and Y-Star presenter. This year saw a number of online engagements that generated a huge buzz in the student community. For instance, prior to the campus rounds, teams that submitted their entries before 21 August were eligible for the early-bird submission prize. There was also a Cheatcode Day, through which the top five winners got the opportunity to have their queries addressed by the case-study partner.Students were equally ecstatic about the competition and shared their feedback. Said Janaki Thakkar, student at IIM, Ahmedabad: This year, the theme was around Innovation and National Impact, and the case study we received was a live project Yes Bank was working on. This made the competition appealing, knowing that our work would add value to the organization, and hence we decided to participate. Of course, the attractive prizes helped! Since we worked on a live problem statement at Yes Bank Transformation Series, the competition gave us an opportunity to apply our classroom learnings to real world scenarios. Further, this competition helped us in exploring the current trends across various sectors and keep us informed about recent developments in the business world. While working on this case, we not only looked into developing marketing plan for the target group but also multiple use-cases that would add value to the customers. Says Pramod Suresh of ISB Hyderabad: The transformation series was a challenging competition which required the use of both our left and right brains to arrive at creative yet logical solutions to an actual problem. Yes Bank and T-Hubs brand ensured that there would be stiff competition. The competition exposed us to the accelerator and fintech ecosystem. It also pushed us to think on new disruptive business models. We also got a holistic exposure into various facets of business and also helped polish the soft skills.According to Rashmi Yadawad of IIM, Calcutta: A competition like Yes Bank Transformation Series gives me an opportunity to know about this in detail and stay updated with the current industries and trends. Apart from knowing about current industries and trends, direct interactions with officials from Yes Bank and Ezetap gave me insights from their perspective, a direct picture of what they have already tried. Competing with the campus winners across different B-school campuses will also give me more learnings and the fire to give my best!The grand finaleIn a first-of-its-kind collaboration, the ministry of new and renewable energy, Government of India, shared a challenge focusing on popularizing solar energy with the 15 finalist teams. The final case study will provide a gruelling test to Indias future business leaders. After proving their worth in real-life business cases, the finale takes them to uncharted territories as they pit their wits on a challenge of national importance. The final case challenges finalists to provide innovative financial solutions for solar, or photovoltaic, installations while also creating a strategy for solar consumer products.India is now at a juncture when we must turn to solar to power our future. The government is fully committed to boosting generation and use of solar energy and aims to add 1,00GW of solar power by 2022. The non-polluting nature of solar energy further underlines its status as the most preferred fuel. We must look to integrate solar energy with the lives of the common Indian by making it cheaper, more reliable and easier to connect to grid. High quality research, technological advancements and innovative financing solutions are the means to ensure solar energy becomes affordable and accessible to all. In this regard, I am happy to note that the Yes Bank Transformation Series will see teams from top B-schools in India offering innovative and path breaking ideas regarding the future growth of solar as a medium of energy. I look forward to receiving some valuable insights and suggestions from the sharp young brains and wish them all the best, said A.K. Tripathi, adviser, ministry of new and renewable energy.The grand finale will be held in New Delhi on 16 and 17 November, where the finalists will get to present their ideas to a jury comprising industry experts and mentors. To kick off the final proceedings of the case challenge, Yes Bank will conduct a curtain-raiser on 16 November in New Delhi, where the final 15 teams will get the opportunity to fine-tune their solutions with the advisory council. They will also get to hear the success stories of some of Indias most successful start-up founders as they prepare to start their own quest to entrepreneurship.On 17 November, the teams will present their solutions to the jury, who will pick three winning teams that present the most innovative ideas that can create an impact.

0.1,"Mumbai: The board of Tata Sons Ltd on Monday replaced Cyrus P. Mistry as chairman, less than four years after he took the helm, and named his predecessor Ratan Tata interim chairman for four months.
				   
				The board of the group holding company did not specify a reason for the abrupt move, which was announced after markets closed.Tata Sons in its collective wisdom and on the recommendations of the principal shareholders decided that it may be appropriate to consider a change for the long-term interest of Tata Sons and Tata group, a spokesperson said. A selection committee comprising Ratan Tata, Venu Srinivasan, Amit Chandra, Ronen Sen and Kumar Bhattacharyya was given the mandate of finding a replacement for Mistry, 48, who became chairman of the $103 billion conglomerate in December 2012, at the end of Tatas over two-decade tenure at the top. The board was given four months to complete the task. In the interim, the board has requested me to perform the role of chairman and I have agreed to do so in the interest of and reassurance to the Tata group, Ratan Tata, 78, said in a statement addressed to colleagues.ALSO READ | Uneasy lies the Tata crownThe development, which portends at least short-term turmoil, comes at a time when the conglomerate, whose business interests range from tea to telecom and salt to software services, has been trying to recast or dispose of the key UK steel business, which it acquired in a $12.9 billion purchase of Corus Group Plc. in 2007 under Ratan Tata.This is quite an unusual situation, unexpected from a group like Tata which stands for its values. This means there could possibly have been some governance issue or some major disagreement with either the style of functioning or decision that Mistry may have taken, said Kavil Ramachandran, professor and executive director at the Thomas Schmidheiny Centre for Family Enterprise at the Indian School of Business.According to a person aware of the development, the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, of which Mistry is a scion and which is estimated to hold an 18% stake in Tata Sons, is protesting the move, paving the ground for what could be a messy battle. About two-thirds of Tata Sons is held by philanthropic trusts such as the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Mistry will continue as a Tata Sons director, the spokesperson cited earlier said. However, the group executive council (GEC), a brainchild of Mistrys, has been disbanded, said a person aware of the development. The GEC page has been pulled down from Tata Sons website as has Mistrys September interview to the in-house magazine in which he stated his views on some of the underperforming companies in the group. Our individual companies need to earn the right to grow, he said in the interview.The boardroom putsch has been some time in the making, according to a person close to Mistry, who asked not to be identified. Differences have surfaced over how Mistry has been dealing with the significant challenges facing the group.Several of Mistrys operational decisions were challenged by Ratan Tata, according to this person. Still, it is the prerogative of the largest shareholder to do this, the person said a few weeks ago. Mint couldnt ascertain if there was an immediate trigger for this ouster.Primarily, it was a lack of communication between the shareholder and the management. A lot of decision-making was done unilaterally by Tata Sons and was not approved by Tata Trusts, said another person briefed about the matter.Among the six chairmen Tata Sons has had so far in its history, Mistrys is the shortest tenure at just short of four years.ALSO READ | Ratan Tata says intolerance a curse we are seeing of lateSince taking over, Mistry has repeatedly talked about continuing to seize business opportunities, especially in emerging technologies.

0.5,"Unlike group firms Adani Enterprises Ltd and Adani Power Ltd, transmission assets owner Adani Transmission Ltd has proved to be a good bet for investors. Despite the volatility, the stock gained 45% in the last one year. Last week it saw another bout of gains after the company said it agreed to buy three transmission line assets from Reliance Infrastructure Ltd, priced at around Rs1,900 crore.
				   
				The agreement comes on the back of two transmission line buys from GMR Energy Ltd for an equity value of around Rs100 crore. The latest acquisition from Reliance Infrastructure has an equity portion of Rs400-500 crore, with the rest Rs1,500 crore being debt that will be transferred to Adani Transmission. Last fiscal year, the company generated an Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of Rs1,863 crore. Roughly half of this was spent on finance costs, leaving the company with a net profit of Rs357 crore. Net cash flows from operations were at Rs1,581 crore.So, given the cash flows, analysts expect Adani Transmission to comfortably close the deal. Further, the transmission revenue for all three assets are collected by a central government-owned utility as a part of a pooling mechanism. This reduces the counter-party risks and helps derive better ratings for its debt instruments, which is important as Adani Transmission is highly dependent on borrowed money.Three global ratings agencies have said that the deal will not affect the companys current rating. With the assets operational and generating revenue, they do not expect the acquisition to weaken the current financial position of Adani Transmission. Fitch estimates that EBITDA contribution from the assets will be sufficient to keep Adani Transmissions financial leverage, as measured by gross debt to EBITDA, at less than 5x in the medium term, Fitch Ratings Singapore Pte Ltd said in a note.What ratings agencies are wary about is the financial leeway for the company. Post the acquisition, Adani Transmission will be left with little financial elbow room, be it for liquidity or for contingencies. While the company itself is in capex mode (building five new lines), it is lapping up assets from the market. We believe the current rating level can accommodate the acquisition although it would leave no headroom for any further material cash outflow, said S&P Global Ratings.Another ratings agency warns that the acquisition is credit negative and leaves little scope for ratings improvement, which could have helped the company refinance or raise funds at even cheaper rates. Further it warned of a downgrade. Adani Transmissions rating could be downgraded if it undertakes aggressive expansion, or if revenues from non-transmission business rise consistently above 25% of total revenues, said Moodys Investors Service Singapore Pte Ltd. On the other hand, the ratings are unlikely to be upgraded in the near term, based on the companys business profile and financial strategy.That said, Adani Transmissions finances are no reason for worry yet.

IRDAI has expressed reservations to accept the scheme of amalgamation in its current form, said Max on BSE. The boards of HDFC Life and Max in August had signed a three way merger, which would create Indias largest private-sector insurer with total assets more than Rs1.1 trillion and lead to the eventual listing of HDFC Life on stock exchanges.Post the merger Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC) and Standard Life (Mauritius Holdings) 2006 Ltd will be the promoters of the merged entity. HDFC will hold around 42.5% of the merged entity and Standard Life 24.1%.

However, the company refutes the same in the BSE disclosure Max said that the scheme of merger or amalgamation is in compliance with law. (company) believes that the scheme of arrangement as submitted to the IRDAI is in compliance with all applicable laws and proposes to represent and clarify the matter to IRDAI, said the statement on BSE.

Basically, Irdai wants to ensure that the merger is happening between two life insurance companies only , I.e HDFC Life and MAX Life. Since it is a three step merger process and Max Financial Services, which is an NBFC, is also involved in the scheme, Irda wants to ensure that at no stage any amalgamation is happening between Max Financial and any insurance company. So we have to clarify and disclose to Irdai that the non-insurance businesses , such as the telecom business, of MAX Financial Services will be first demerged into Max India and then only the life insurance business of Max Life will be effectively transferred completely to Max Financial Services and subsequently it will be merged with HDFC Life which will result in the automatic listing of the merged entity said a person involved in the merger process on condition of anonymity. Irda had sought the views and recommendation of solicitor general of India a week back and the latest step by Irda has been taken accordingly it seems. The bankers and the lawyers involved in the deal will make a representation to Irda on Tuesday and subsequently the clarifications and the required disclosures will be made. The issue raised by Irda is just a basic technical disclosure requirement for more clarity on the deal to the regulators and the public. This will not come in the way of the merger.

				According to the global financial services major, fiscal consolidation in 2017-18 is mainly driven by a reduction in expenditure, particularly current spending. Overall, we believe the government has maintained a balance between prioritising capital spending and being fiscally prudent, Goldman Sachs said in a research note. The government, in its annual Union budget, called for a reduction in fiscal deficit to 3.2% of GDP in 2017-18, from a projected 3.5% in 2016-17 and an estimated 3.9% in 2015-16. ALSO READ: An RBI rate cut at next weeks monetary policy review isnt a givenThe budgeted fiscal consolidation takes place via a decrease in total expenditure as a percentage of GDP, especially current expenditure, while capital spending remains high, the report said. It added that the revenue targets look achievable, with any downside risk to disinvestment target potentially offset by somewhat higher tax revenue growth. The Economic Survey forecasts GDP growth at 6.75-7.50% in 2017-18. The budgeted primary deficit net of disinvestment proceeds is unchanged at 0.6% of GDP in 2017-18 versus 2016-17, suggesting limited negative impulse on growth from the proposed fiscal consolidation in 2017-18, it said adding, the favourable expenditure mix should support 2017-18 growth. The report further noted that though the recent fall in headline inflation along with fiscal consolidation, supports the possibility of a rate cut by the RBI at its next policy meeting, several other factors warrant a cautious approach. Our base case remains for a 25 bps rate cut by the RBI at its meeting on 7-8 February, but we acknowledge that this will be a close call, it added.

				Edited excerpts:At a time when pharma companies are queuing up to buy assets in the US, what was the rationale behind picking up assets in the UK which are supposed to be low-margin?This company is exceptional. It is one of the best performing companies in UK and Ireland. Their margins are quite high. It is not a distressed asset. Our intention is not to buy a loss-making unit and turn it around. It takes time to reach this position and we would like to be No.1 or 2 in certain markets. With this deal, we will be becoming the No.1 or 2 in UK and Ireland. There is good management attached to it. Also, our own existing business can get the benefit of this strong management.How have you financed the acquisition?We have created long-term debt to fund the acquisition. The balance sheet is strong enough for us to borrow around another $1 billion. We are generating a lot of cash, so in another three to four years, the way we are working, we will be debt-free. So its not a big concern.Our net-worth-to-debt is around 1x, we can go to around 3x to 4x, so it is not an issue at all. Also, right now in the market scenario, interest level globally is very low, if you are talking in pound terms. And there is enough margin in this business. So effective interest cost is low, so it is not a big risk.Was there an aggressive bidding for the asset?I would not like to comment on other bidders. The fact is that such assets dont come in the market too often. Price is not the only criteria. Its an integration of two companies. We have around 250 people in Europe, here we will be taking up to 400 people. Its not just the price, the strategy is more important.What are your quick thoughts on the acquisition?It will increase our Europe presence and will make us either No. 1 or No. 2 in UK and Ireland. We are still Ahmedabad people. No change in the style of working, we will be working the same way. Its not that this deal is going to change something dramatically.

-0.87,"Mumbai: Leaving behind an academic life in the tree-lined streets of New Yorks west village, Viral Acharya now must confront the chaos wrought by the scrapping of high denomination notes in the worlds second-most-populous nation.
				   
				The 42-year-old professor of finance at New York Universitys Stern School of Business starts his three-year term as deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India on Friday, where hell take on the key portfolios of monetary policy, market operations and research.With governor Urjit Patel eschewing the spotlight since taking over from his rockstar predecessor Raghuram Rajan, investors will be looking to Acharya for guidance on how the RBI will get growth back on its former world-beating path. Longer term, the keen musician and expert on Indian financial markets faces the challenge of modernizing capital markets and institutions in a nation where as many as 600 million people dont have a bank account.Why a cashless economy is still a fantasy for IndiaAcharya will take a seat on the Indias newly formed Monetary Policy Committee, which has in the past two meetings voted unanimously to cut interest rates in October and then to hold rates in December  both decisions taking markets by surprise. Meanwhile, pressure is increasing on the central bank to counter the slowdown by easing monetary policy in coming months.Bad bank debtsIndia is at an exciting but challenging time, Acharya said in a statement last week released on the NYU Sterns website. As one of the worlds fastest growing economies, India has the massive potential to become an economic powerhouse.Acharya, described as an outstanding and prolific scholar by the Dean of NYU Stern, Peter Henry, has authored research papers and articles on subjects, from analyzing systemic risk in the European banking sector to the health of Indian state-run and private banks. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Acharya said the government should consider allowing healthier private sector banks to buy the branch networks of distressed state-run banks as a way of preventing bad loans from festering.Bad debts at Indian lenders, especially those in the dominant state-run sector, have climbed to a 14-year high, and are expected to rise further as an economic slowdown makes it harder for banks to recover loans.Markets expertThere is a recognition that Indias capital markets need development, said Shilan Shah, Singapore-based India economist at Capital Economics. Certainly with his expertise, we can look forward to further reforms in the marketplace.Bankers and analysts also expect the RBI to ramp up its faltering communication strategy after Acharya, who is described as affable by friends, takes charge. The RBI has come under increasing flak, with several ex-central bankers criticizing its approach.A cloak of secrecy continues to shroud Prime Minister Narendra Modis currency ban decision and that has led to a view that authorities were not prepared for such a move. With the RBI top-brass making only occasional appearances and choosing not to explain its many flip flops, concerns over the central banks independence have gained ground.The RBIs largely silent approach is not very judicious and only adds on to concerns about the government undermining its independence, said Priyanka Kishore, Singapore-based lead Asia economist at Oxford Economics. Acharyas appointment will be a breath of fresh air.

0.49,"In 2014, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi first placed solar energy at the core of the energy mix that would fuel Indias economic growth, scepticism abounded: how will the government deliver? Isnt the target of 100 gigawatts (GW) of solar energy, later revised to 175GW of renewable energy, by 2022, too ambitious? Also, isnt solar energy expensive? How will Indias poor afford it? Just about two years later, the answers are emergingslowly but steadily.
				   
				This past Friday, the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) called for bids to install 1GW of rooftop solar power projects on central government buildingsits largest tender yet in this segment. India is already home to the worlds largest single-location solar power plant which has been set up by the Adani Group at Kamuthi in Tamil Nadu. The 648 megawatts (MW) project, built in a record time of eight months, dislodged Californias 550MW Topaz Solar Farm in September to secure the top spot and propel India past the 10GW total capacity threshold. Indeed, huge advances have been made in the past few yearsin terms of solar energy specifically and renewable energy in general. According to a Bloomberg New Energy Finance report, the solar sector has had an impressive compound annual growth rate of 59% in the last four fiscal years and its installed capacity at the end of the FY2016 was pegged at 6.8GW. Similarly, the share of renewable energy in Indias total energy mix has also increased from 12.5% in FY2013 to 14.1% in FY2016. Yes, this also shows how fossil fuels still make up the majority of Indias energy basket but lets not ignore how quickly renewables are catching up. With a cumulative CAGR of 15%, renewables are growing at a faster rate than coal power plants, which are increasing at 12.5%. Now, place this against the backdrop of Indias large untapped renewable energy potentialaccording to the government-developed India Energy Security Scenarios, India can achieve 479GW of solar power and 410GW of wind power by 2047and it is possible to see how, if India plays its cards correctly,  solar and other forms of renewable energy may eventually drive economic growth. Specifically, India seems to be on track to achieve its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution, promised as part of the Paris pact to fight climate change, to get at least 40% of its total installed power from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030.In terms of pricing, SECI breached new frontiers yet again in November with a record low tariff offering of Rs3 per unit. The winning firm at the reverse auctionGurgaon-based Amplus Energy Solutions Pvt. Ltd, which will be installing a total of 14.5MW of solar rooftop plants across the countryhas promised these rates specifically for Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Puducherry. At one level, low tariff offering doesnt come as a surprisethis figure has been consistently falling since 2010 when it was pegged at Rs17.91 per unit; over the past few years, it had somewhat stabilized at about Rs5 per unit when the US-based SunEdison, one of the worlds largest renewable energy firms and which has now filed for bankruptcy protection, shook up the market in late 2015, offering to sell power at Rs4.63 per unit to win NTPC Ltds contract for a 500MW solar park in Andhra Pradesh. Months later, in January, Finnish company Fortum FinnSurya Energy Pvt. Ltd went a step ahead and quoted Rs4.34 per unit to secure the contract for 70MW solar plant at NTPCs Bhadla Solar Park in Rajasthan.What these low rates now mean for consumers is that solar energy, which until recently was too expensive for large-scale use in a developing country, is now on track to compete with cheap fossil fuels. Today, Indias cheapest electricity tariff is at around Rs1-2 per unit. This rate is for the farm sector which is followed by the residential sector and then the commercial sector. But while these are of course promising figures, there is still a long way to go.  The low tariffs, for example, are a double-edged sword. Driven by aggressive bids from firms desperate for a toe-hold in this sunrise sector,  they have fuelled concerns about viability and project financing, especially for those below the Rs5 per unit threshold. SunEdison, in fact, has put its India assets on the block (some of which were incidentally picked up by Amplus).  Moreover, India still has to make available the necessary capital for developing renewable energy infrastructurethe former Planning Commission had estimated under the 12th Five Year Plan that more than a trillion dollars will be requiredand it will have to work every option on the table (from domestic industry to international donors) to fund this turnaround. Similarly, several structural issues in the distribution of power need to be addressed. Indias installed capacity of 275GW is already in excess of its demand of 140GW. Yet, there are still parts of the country where there is no electricity while in many others, power cuts are the norm. This is due to a variety of factors such as coal supply shortage, transmission losses and the poor health of power utilities.As renewables enter this mix, they will have to be integrated into the existing system and structure. As a NITI Aayog expert group report notes, A probable re-engineering of institutions, the redefinition of policies, the re-tuning of power systems, and the replacement of old habits with new ones will be required. This fundamental re-structuring of the countrys power and energy infrastructure will be its biggest challenge. Can India achieve its solar power targets?

0.52,"Mumbai: Cyrus Mistry, who was part of the panel tasked to find a successor to Ratan Tata for heading the over $100 billion Tata Group, had himself become a surprise selection only to see his tenure cut short abruptly on Monday within four yearsthe shortest at the conglomerate. 
				   
				The 78-year-old Tata is now part of the selection panel that has been asked to search the next chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, the groups main holding company, within next four months and he would also serve as interim chairman in this period.Also Read: Cyrus Mistry ousted as Tata Sons chairman, Ratan Tata steps inA low-profile man to the extent of being reclusive, Mistry, 48, was a surprise choice to succeed Tata, who retired on 29 December, 2012 as chairman of the one of the countrys oldest business empires. The only second non-Tata to take charge of the group after Nowroji Saklatvala in 1932, Mistry by virtue of his age came in with a lot of promise, specially of continuity when he became chairman of Tata Sonsthe promoter of the major operating Tata companies at the age of 44. However, in nearly four years since he took over the reins of the salt-to-software conglomerate, Mistry had to face many challenges in both domestic and global markets as many of the group companies faced headwinds. He undertook a strategy of divesting assets in contrast to what his successor did. Significant among them is the groups steel business, specially Tata Steel Europe. Earlier this year, the company had completed selling of the European long products business in the UK as well as a mill in France to Greybull Capital. It had also announced plans to sell its UK operations after years of losses, although the company is yet to finalize the sale. In July, Tata groups hospitality firm Indian Hotels Company Ltd (IHCL), which runs Taj Group of hotels, completed sale of Taj Boston hotel for $125 million (about Rs839 crore). The hospitality firm had also sold off 12.7 lakh shares of Belmond (earlier known as Orient Express, which the Tata Group tried unsuccessfully to acquire in Ratan Tatas time) for a consideration of $11.96 million. IHCL had also sold BLUE Sydney, a Taj Hotel, to Australia Hotels & Properties Ltd for AU$ 32 million (nearly Rs179 crore) in 2014. The Tata group is also engaged in a legal battle with Japans Docomo over the split of their telecom joint venture Tata Docomo. Contrary to these developments, Tata led the group into some notable acquisitions, starting from Tetley by Tata Tea for $450 million in 2000 to steelmaker Corus by Tata Steel in 2007 and the landmark Jaguar Land Rover in 2008 for $2.3 billion by Tata Motors. Also read: Uneasy lies the Tata crownWhile the reasons for Mistrys sacking by the Tata Sons board is not clear, according to sources, the decision taken on the suggestion of Tata Trusts. In the long term interest of Tata Sons and the Tata Group, the principal shareholdersTata Trusts suggested to the Board of Tata Sons that it would be appropriate to look for a change and look forward, a source said. When Mistry took over, the Tata Group had a revenue of $100.09 billion in 2011-12. Since then, the groups revenue grew to $103 billion in 2015-16. About 66% of the equity capital of Tata Sons is held by philanthropic trusts endowed by members of the Tata family. The largest of these trusts are the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Sir Ratan Tata Trust, which were created by the families of the sons of Jamsetji Tata, the founder. Mistry belongs to Shapoorji Pallonji, which is the single largest shareholder in Tata Sons with 18.4% stake.

0.25,"Mumbai: Mark Machin, who worked as CPP Investment Boards (CPPIB) first president for Asia, was recently named president and chief executive of Canadas largest pension fund and is responsible for leading its investment activities. As of 30 September, the CPP Fund had net assets of Canadian $300.5 billion. CPPIB opened its India office in 2015 and  has committed about $3.7 billion in the country so far. In an interview, Machin talks about India as an investment destination, increasing allocation to emerging markets and the funds plans. Edited excerpts: 
You were earlier heading Asia and obviously have looked at the markets closely. With you at the helm now, do we expect more focus on Asia also reflecting in your investment philosophy?Its got nothing to do with that. It is basically intelligent portfolio construction so we will have a globally diversified portfolio and emerging markets are a growing piece of global economy and global markets. Today, we have an objective of 15% of the portfolio being in emerging markets over the next 3-5 years. We are about 10% today and we have an objective to move towards 15%. We will also look at increasing it to 20% over a period of time. How does a big institutional investor like you look at India in terms of the good, bad and the ugly?India, in the long term, is fantastic, its got the best profile in the world. It has got demographic growth, increase in productivity, so theres long-term economic growth. If you look at returns on equity across markets, its mid to high teens over a 20-year period, so all its long term trends are fantastic. The issue is not to get too caught up in the euphoria or in the depression that happens from time to time. So, we like all that. There are three things that are discussed from time to time: the stability and the effectiveness of the government to effect change, the second thing is the oil price spike is a real challenge for India and third thing is high interest rates. But right now, we are in a good place and that is why a lot of money is looking at India. You mentioned that you want to allocate about 15% to emerging markets. How will that translate into a number for India?I am reluctant to give you a headline number as that could be over-interpreted as an immediate objective. Were going to keep growing as a fund over time. We are C$300 billion today. The chief actuary has a projection that we will be C$600 billion by 2030. If the reforms of the Canada pension system comes through, then we could be C$800 billion by 2030. So its going to grow from to $600 or 800 billion by 2030 and so that emerging market allocation, over time, will go up from 15% to around 20%. Twenty percent of C$800 billion is a big number.You mentioned that the problem you are facing in this country is that you dont find opportunities which can absorb large ticket sizes. Does it mean that can we perhaps see CPPIB doing stuff like investing in a Flipkart on consumer internet companies which have an appetite to absorb large amounts of capital. Will you tweak your investment thesis for India?We tweaked it for Asia for a couple of years back that we will do smaller private equity kind of investments. So, we also look at $50-100 million kind of investments in Asia. With regards to e-commerce, we have made substantial investments in e-commerce in China. We have invested in Alibaba, in JD.com and a number of other e-commerce players. Well look here as well. We havent found the right one at the right valuation. When we looked at it before, we found the valuations very high, so we didnt invest then. But we continue to evaluate. How does the investment thesis of pension fund manager differ from that of a private equity fund manager...theres a perception that pension fund is free money. Can you address that perception?I will speak for CPPIB so I cant speak for other pension funds. One of the things which is different from private equity fund is that private equity fund has to give the money back to investors, it has to be invested and has to give back, so generally theyre restricted on the length of the investments. They have 1, 2, 3 years to be invested and then getting out of the investments. Even though they have a 10 year fund life, they dont want to be hanging on to investments for 10 years. So thats a challenge. For us we never have to sell anything. So we buy something we like and if we continue to like it, we keep holding it. We can hold it forever if it has value. We can also sell in a shorter time frame. You have a huge focus in real estate and infra, will it continue in India or youll look at other sectors also?Well look at lot of different things, I think consumer facing, financial services our biggest investment here is in Kotak Bank. So financial services, consumer retail, tech and IT will be our focus areas. Then there is a whole bunch of other structural things that we are doing. The aim is to scale and deploy more capital over time, for example, on platforms. We have done nothing of that in India, but in the US we bought a mid-market lending unit from GE. We think that platform is something definitely worth looking at in India.Within Asia Pacific, China is of big importance to you, given the sheer size of the economy and that its much bigger than India. Yes, China is the second biggest economy in the world. We would be failing in our duty to our pensioners if we dont focus on China. We have to look at it and we have to assess opportunities. Not investing in the second biggest economy in the world would be a huge market call. So yes we are invested in China, and we have found interesting things. But likewise India is going to catch up over time.Talking about investments, you have partnered with groups such as Kotak, and Larsen and Toubro which are really considered blue-chip and are fairly large. Do you think that there is a big opportunity set in the country to attract large cheque sizes?Yes that is a limiting factor, to find the size opportunity. It is not the availability of capital or willingness from our side. Thats a challenge for us.There are so many Canadian funds investing here in India nowBrookfield, Fairfax and CDPQ. Is there a Canada-India corridor building out and is that also because a lot of our ministers visit Canada frequently. Why is there a sudden influx of capital from Canada to India?We have been investing in India for six years and we have an office here. We have only seven offices outside of Canada. So thats an indication that we will have significant investments here over time.The interest in India is a function of two thingsthe development of the Indian economy and the size of the opportunity but its also the development and maturing of the funds in Canada that they feel confident enough to go out and look at these opportunities.This is a trend so more and more direct investors are going to come here, some of which will be Canadian. We have a lot of other institutional investors here such as KKR and everyone is chasing the same few large deals. There is too much capital chasing few deals. How do you plan to play that out?Be patient. If the opportunity is not there then we dont have to invest. Thats the beauty.If you are a fund managing someone elses money and if you dont invest then their LPs are likely to be upset. So they have more pressure to invest. We dont have that pressure. If there is no opportunity that fits our criteria then we invest our money elsewhere. So we can be very patient.You have done a lot of stuff in China real estate. What is your gameplan for India?In China, what we have done is we partnered with international developers. We have got joint ventures for shopping malls, office, mixed-use commercial. We have started some joint ventures with domestic developers as well. We want to do the same thing here. So we have partnered with the Shapoorji Group, which is a joint venture for office and we have one asset. We anticipate that we will do the other things here too, over time. We will partner with more private developers. We typically partner with a very experience blue chip developer. And we start off with buying existing buildings, we dont take development risk. Although, over time we might take some development risk. You have tied-up with Shapoorji. Does Tata-Mistry fiasco concern you?It has created a lot of noise around the stock and the group. Its not great for valuation of group overall. Weve been watching. But our tie-up with Shapoorji is focused on commercial real estate. Its separate. We dont deal with them in that capacity. In India, a lot of focus on stressed assets. You have an alliance with Kotak, but will you be looking at something else also in that space in India?We hope that partnership holds good and we find some good things to do together. Thats our number one vehicle for looking at that space. Well look at other situations as well but thats our main vehicle. We havent deployed any capital yet though. We are optimistic, things will come up over time. What has the India experience been like?So far, so good. Lots of lessons learnt. We have really been careful whom we are teaming up with and so far our relationships have been great. No big problems. Lessons learnt in India: Be very selective who you team up with, second one is keep your eye on the long term, dont get caught up in short term depression or euphoria. Do you see competing yourself with somebody like CDPQ?Not really. Cant recall any situation where we have bumped into each other here in India. We have bumped into each other around the world. Though we try not to. Were trying to achieve similar objectives but for different group of pensioners.They look after Quebec, we look out to rest of Canada. We dont intentionally bump into them. How are you looking at the demonetisation drive in the country? Its the first time weve seen, its the biggest fast move policy implementation weve ever seen. Its incredible speed of implementation.You never hear in India people talking about policies being implemented so quickly. First time ever. So its amazing. For long-term investors like us its probably a good thing. With digitization of economy, bringing efficiency in the economy, more financial assets moving into the banking system, and more transparency. From our point of view its a good thing but were sympathetic to the stress that people are gonna going through in the short term.",2017-01-09,YFJEyB88NKND8x7W7NOy5L,"CPPIB CEO Mark Machin on India as an investment destination, increasing allocation to emerging markets and the pension funds plans",01:33,A lot of money is looking at India: CPPIBs Mark Machin

				Edited excerpts from an interview:What is your assessment of demonetisation?Why it happened and whether it was right or wrong is all over now. I think a few things need to be done now. First is of course moving towards the cashless economy. So more digital payment and more transactions is one thing that should happen and I think some of the impediment against it in terms of additional cost involved... taxes should ease. The other thing is because of so much money coming in,  banks have responded and reduced the interest rates by 1 percentage point. There has never been a 1% cut.  I believe over a period interest rates should ease further. The third thing is that some sectors, which were not in mainstream, which were unorganized, will now become organized . The number of taxpayers will increase and so will the governments revenues, and, eventually, its spending. There should be increase in investments. There should be a further easing of tax rates. We need phase two of ease of doing business, be it tax, licenses or regulations.How easy do you think going cashless will be for Indian trade?It takes time to change anybodys habit. It will require sustainable effort in terms of educating people, pushing them and creating some kind of incentive for them to move towards it. How would you rate  2016, from the point of view of the Indian economy and businesses and what do you think lies ahead in 2017?So in 2016, we could get to a close to 7% growth and that was good. By and large industry has done well. Going forward we need to get away from the short-term impact of demonetisation. We have to undo it which means there has to be some more effort towards increasing demand in 2017. So that we can regain whatever we have lost. The Brexit vote happened in 2016 but Brexit has not yet happened; similarly, Donald Trump has been elected but what he will do, we will get to know now. It is difficult to say what kind of impact these will have. Brexit could be positive for India because UK might have to partner with other markets. When do you see things returning to normal after demonetisation? I think things are easing out already. Many of the sectors are normalizing.  I believe some more banking reach in rural areas is essential. I believe that by the end of March, we should see normal growth, or even better.What are your expectations from the goods and services tax?  GST needs to happen, there is no other way.

				Growth in data revenue fell to 27% on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, from 34% in the March quarter and 45% in the December 2015 quarter. In the mainstay voice business, average realization per minute improved for the second consecutive quarter, due to a reduction in promotional offers. But this strategy backfired as far as volume growth was concernedvoice volumes fell by 1% sequentially. On a y-o-y basis, voice volumes grew by just 1.8%. We have found Ideas dynamic management of the price-volume equation in the voice business impressive in the past; however, we do believe the company has not managed to strike the right balance of late, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients. In all, revenue grew by 8% y-o-y. At the same time, thanks to a vigorous expansion in its data network coverage, network operating costs rose by 16% y-o-y. Profit margins naturally fell. Adjusted for one-offs, Kotaks analysts estimate Ebitda margins fell 90 basis points y-o-y. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. A basis point is 0.01%.Profit after tax slumped 65%, which was more or less on expected lines, as interest costs almost tripled on network expansion, spectrum renewal and acquisition costs. Tracking the rise in capital expenditure and finance costs, analysts were forecasting a fall in profit. Still, the results have disappointed. While slow revenue growth and a sharp rise in costs weighed on the June quarter performance, the pressure on Idea Cellulars earnings may continue to keep investors on the edge.Hopefully, the company will change tracks with its pricing strategy and voice volume growth may come back on track. Slowing data volume growth is a big worry, however, especially keeping in mind the large amount of investments the company has made in the segment. Besides, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds launch, expected later this year, can worsen competitive dynamics.The silver lining in all this is that Idea Cellulars shares have already underperformed the broader market by a wide margin and valuations are inexpensive.

				The company with 86 megawatts of wind power in India and another 78MW under development is the latest investor to complain that some Indian power retailers are stifling investment and undermining Prime Minister Narendra Modis green-power ambitions.The power distribution companies, called discoms, are months in arrears in some places and are seeking to limit the amount of renewable energy they buy because electricity from fossil-fuel generators is cheaper.If the discom risk wasnt there, we could have easily built about 400 to 500 megawatts of additional wind projects, Glen Reccani, managing director of Accionas Indian unit, said in an interview. How do you fit that into your business model?The delays matter because theyre stalling Indias $200 billion plan to more than quadruple wind and solar capacity. Modi wants wind and solar power to supply 200 gigawatts of power by 2022, up from 45GW at present.These discoms are paying conventional generators but they havent paid wind from July 2015 onwards and are actively discriminating against wind generators, said Sumant Sinha, founder of ReNew Power Ventures Pvt. Ltd.Acciona said its shelved investment plans in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, which are at the crux of the delayed payments.The director of Madhya Pradesh Power Management Company Ltd, Sanjay Kuman Shukla, said via telephone that we have cleared all our dues til July and that remaining dues of a couple months cannot be compared with delays in other states. Officials from discoms in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu didnt return phone calls seeking comment.According to Indias Wind Independent Power Producers Association, developers with almost 8GW of installed capacity in states are facing payment delays and lack power-purchase agreements.We have the financial wherewithal to keep the debt servicing current, but a lot of the smaller guys dont and with this problem non performing assets are creeping in for some of the generators in Maharashtra, Sinha said.Bridge loansReNew Power said 360MW of wind power in Maharashtra, 150MW in Rajasthan and 100MW in Madhya Pradesh are affected by payment delays, impacting 35% of the companys revenue.Cash-squeezed investors are being forced to use equity to pay off loans and then seek a bridge loan for new or pending projects, according to Sunil Jain, the president of the wind association.Bankers realize if youre not getting paid for the old projects, how will you get paid for the new ones, and become reluctant to give loans, Jain said in a phone interview.Wind generators are turning to bridge loans to balance obligation with the delays, according to Ashok Haldia, who heads PTC India Financial Services Ltd.Interest rates on such loans are higher than the project loan normally by up to 2 percent, Haldia said in a phone interview.

0.56,"Investors in Internet start-ups and growth-stage companies have to traverse a strange universe. The closest parallel I can find is the film industry. As a producer (investor), I might have all the right ingredientsa star-studded cast, a fantastic storyline, chart-busting music scores, breathtaking sets and cinematography, and a visionary directorbut whether or not the film does well at the box office is still somewhat of a gamble. You never know whether the reagents are just right to serve up a blockbuster.Except with the Internet start-up, its even worse since there is another twistthe simple fact that there are a bunch of other start-ups with the exact same storyline! This would be akin to several independent production houses producing the same James Bond movie (since they all own the idea or franchise)at the same time and trying to bring it to the market as fast as possible. This means that there are multiple, simultaneous, identical experiments all taking place at the same time, and no one knows who will win.But wait, I hear you say; doesnt the one who is first to the market end up winning since they will have the first-mover advantage? Well, not necessarily. The me too scenario also works. And not just with the Lyfts and Olas who are replicating Uber today. History also shows us this. Yahoo was the first, true large-scale search engine. It was upended by Google, which, apart from having (at the time) a better search algorithm, also quickly added other chemical reagents to the mixfree email, Web hosting, smartphone software, smart glasses and so on. The result? Googles market capitalization, as I write this, is almost 14 times that of Yahoo$517 billion compared to Yahoos $35 billion. I remember burning my fingers by investing in Yahoo prior to the dot-com burst of 2001. The stock first fell like a stoneand then remained at the bottom of the pond for years thereafter, before staging a weak comeback afterwards. Its still around, and is still a great company, but a Google it is not. And as a footnotewhile Yahoo went public in 1996, Google didnt go public until almost eight-and-a-half years later in 2004which in Internet terms is like a day and night of Brahma8.64 billion solar years, to be precise.In the interim, Yahoo, the firm, has had several chief executivesBartz, Morse, Thompson, Levinsohn and Mayer. (That string sounds almost like the name of a white-shoe law firm.) Not so Google, where, though Indias own Sundar Pichai is now CEO, the founding team of Larry Page, Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt agreed to work together for 20 years after the IPO (until 2024). Page handed the reins over to Pichai only last year, but still remains very involved.The same analogy can be drawn with our own earlier generation of labour arbitrage-based start-ups: the technology services firms. Firms like Infosys, Cognizant and Mindtree, while sometimes criticized for the collegiality of their founding teams, have ended up having had the last laugh despite having had to weather financial crises before. All said and done, Infosyslike Cognizant, Tata Consultancy Services and some other large Indian services companies with stable management teamsis now a global champion, and Mindtree is a strong contender in the next rung.Maybe there are lessons to be learnt from this for Indias array of current start-ups, which saw a market arbitrage opportunity to enter the Internet retail space before their larger global counterparts could enter the market, essentially creating the equivalent of Jack Mas Chinese Alibaba. Flipkart and Snapdeals valuations seem to have hit a wall. Much of the publicity associated with this has been focused on the fact that foreign investors, afraid of a global slowdown and unproven business models, have written down their existing investments in the sector and are unwilling to pony up more cash. And the global market leader, Amazon, has entered the Indian market in a big way.The current bearish scenario in international markets will surely change, just as it did post-2001 and then again post-2008, so the trick is just to hold on and fend off Amazons advance until the financial tide turns. Despite recent changes in the law, Amazon is after all not an Indian firm and will face more hurdles than the home-grown rivals. But, meanwhile, instead of signing long-term agreements to work together and weather what is just a simple financial stormso that they can later go public and monetize their holdingsmany senior executives at these firms seem to be using the revolving door.Just like in the movies, you can only have one or two heroes/heroines in the cast. And the same is true of the villains. Similarly each start-up can only have one or two sultans or sultanas, but constancy in the top teams is vital. Google has its Page, Facebook its Zuckerberg, Alibaba its Ma, and Snapdeal and Flipkart have their Bahl and Bansals. But the sultans need to think of Henry Fords maxim when it comes to business: Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success. A series of cameo appearances does not a blockbuster make.Siddharth Pai is a world-renowned technology consultant who has personally led over $20 billion in complex, first-of-a-kind outsourcing transactions.",2016-04-20,ZQFsl3WTYrbJ5oGFrfBQFM,"Each start-up can only have one or two sultans or sultanas, but constancy in the top teams is vital

				To its credit, the home loan lenders net profit grew by 12% to Rs1,701.21 crore for the December quarter, marginally higher than analysts estimates. Indeed, the housing finance company has seen better quarters before with higher profit growth but the latest is not to be sneezed at especially in the wake of the currency withdrawal.The fact that the profit comes on the back of a strong operating performance, with net interest income growing at 17%, and asset quality holding up in the aftermath of demonetisation is enough reason for investors to like the stock. HDFCs shares, which were initially pummelled on demonetisation worries, have gained 13% so far in 2017, shrugging off the initial negative sentiment.The home loan firm seems to have weathered the demonetisation event much like its smaller peers. The currency withdrawal could shave only one percentage point off HDFCs individual loan book growth, which slipped to 15% for the third quarter from the average 16% in the previous two quarters. This is adjusting for the loans sold by the lender. Its non-individual loan book that is largely made of developer loans grew at a faster pace of 17% for the December quarter.But the worry is that HDFCs individual loan book growth has been slowing over the last three years. Its individual loan book growth was as high as 19.7% in  fiscal year 2014, which dropped to 16.8% in FY15 and then to 15.6% in FY16. According to Religare Capital Markets research wing, the home loan lenders individual loan book growth could drop to sub-12% for FY18.HDFCs individual loan book has been its strength and the growth in it outstripped that of the corporate loan portfolio until 2015-16. The push for mortgage loans, healthy rise in real estate prices and the managements focus on individual loans boosted the portfolio over the past years. This year, the share of individual loans in incremental loan disbursals has dropped to 73% in the December quarter from 88% in the June quarter.The lingering effects of demonetisation will perhaps reduce growth in disbursements for another quarter.

				UPI was expected to hit digital wallets when it was launched last August, but the latter have grabbed a lions share of digital payments traffic after Indias demonetization move in November.Now, if the PhonePe-ICICI Bank row isnt resolved quickly, it may discourage people from using UPI, curbing the network effect that needs to play out for the platform to grow fast.ALSO READ | How Paytm cashed in on cash banThe vacillation by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), which created the UPI platform, on the row also threatens to erode the credibility of the platform in the short term, said analysts and people working with NPCI.Earlier this month, ICICI Bank blocked transactions on PhonePe. Then, on Thursday, NPCI directed ICICI to allow transactions on PhonePe. A day later, NPCI reversed its stance and said PhonePe violated UPI guidelines of interoperability.The PhonePe-ICICI issue reflects badly on UPI. One of them needs to blink but both are standing their ground, said Amrish Rau, chief executive of payments firm PayU India.According to Rau, for UPI to realize its full potential, the government will, at some point, have to change the framework in which UPI operates.As such, the NPCI needs to be congratulated for the scale at which they have launched UPI. UPI has done really well in such a short span of time and a lot of it is because of NPCI. But because NPCI is controlled by the big banks, it is up to the government to step in and reduce the fees banks earn on payment transactions. Additionally, they need to allow fintech players to become part of the UPI system, which isnt happening now, said Rau.ALSO READ | Whats ailing UPI and how to fix itNPCI was set up in December 2008 and has 10 promoter banks, one of which is ICICI Bank. PhonePes partner, Yes Bank Ltd, is not one of the promoters. PhonePe has partnered with Yes Bank because of restrictions around which companies can launch on UPI.(The PhonePe-ICICI issue) is a temporary speed bump and it should get sorted out soonbut it was an unnecessary roadblock and is the kind of thing that UPI does not need right now. Every extra day that this issue plays out is a day lost, and customers will automatically shift to other platforms where they get better customer experience, an NPCI executive said on condition of anonymity.A.P. Hota, chief executive officer of NPCI, declined to comment for this story.The PhonePe-ICICI row has highlighted the risk of arbitrary action by one player that may end up harming the whole UPI ecosystem.But some analysts said that unless other banks take their cue from ICICI Bank, UPI will continue to increase its popularity with consumers because of its ease of usage. Unlike a digital wallet that needs to be refilled with money frequently, UPI does away with this step by connecting payments directly with the bank accounts of a user.It boils down to a simple fight for the customer that is going online. The fight between ICICI and PhonePe is a manifestation of that and the competition it signifies, said Harish H.V., partner at cosultancy Grant Thornton. If you look at the bigger picture, the inter-operability of the UPI platform ensures that even if one bank is not on the platform, the customer can route it through the platform of other banks. As long as inter-operability exists, it wont cause significant disruption to overall UPI adoption, unless other banks also start blocking payments.",2017-01-24,ZpuXk20VaLCPPFyR0iBU6M,"If the PhonePe-ICICI Bank row isnt resolved quickly, it may discourage people from using UPI, curbing the network effect that needs to play out for the platform to grow fast",00:21,Will PhonePe-ICICI Bank spat affect UPI expansion?
-0.02,"Mumbai: Some of Indias biggest lenders are asking the central bank to ease debt-management rules as they try to restructure about Rs87,000 crore ($13 billion) owed by Essar Steel Ltd. and Bhushan Steel Ltd., according to people with knowledge of the matter.
				   
				Lenders including State Bank of India and ICICI Bank Ltd. are aiming to restructure the debt under a new program the Reserve Bank of India started in June, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. The steelmakers dont currently meet the programs requirements because they have not generated enough free cash flow to service at least 50% of their liabilities, the people said.The creditors are asking the RBI to reduce the serviceable-debt target used in the Scheme for Sustainable Structuring of Stressed Assets, or S4A, as the program is known, the people said.Indian steel producers have found it more difficult to repay loans as higher raw-material prices cut into their earnings. The price of coking coal is up 129% in the past 12 months, even after falling 43% from a high in November, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Servicing loansLenders to the two steelmakers are also asking the central bank to consider a change to the way it calculates a companys ability to repay debt, one of the people said. Under current rules, the RBI uses a firms latest results to determine the amount of free cash flow available to service loans. Creditors would prefer the RBI use more forward-looking figures, such as profit forecasts based on potential economic growth, according to the person.Banks make requests to us for changes in different regulations, which we examine and take a view, the RBI said in an e-mailed response to Bloomberg queries.Bhushan Steel chief financial officer Nittin Johari didnt immediately respond to a phone call and e-mail seeking comment. Representatives for State Bank of India and ICICI Bank didnt immediately respond to e-mailed questions.Essar Steel has submitted a proposal to lenders which is under consideration, Ganesh Pai, a spokesman for the company, said in an e-mailed response to Bloomberg queries, adding that its inappropriate for the company to comment on matters between banks and the RBI. Essar Steels production volume for the quarter ended 31 December rose 61% from a year earlier, Pai said.

0.5,"Mumbai/Tokyo/Chicago: The emergence of Shahid Khan, the NFL team owner who made his fortune selling car bumpers, in the race to rescue embattled Japanese airbag manufacturer Takata Corp. pits the billionaire against more established parts suppliers and some of the worlds biggest buyout firms.
				   
				Pakistan-born Khan, 66, migrated as a teenager to the US, where he started washing dishes for $1.20 an hour. He later built Urbana, Illinois-based Flex-N-Gate Corp. into an auto-parts supplier that ranks him among the richest Americans, with an estimated net worth of about $5 billion. Along the way, he bought the Jacksonville Jaguars in Florida and the London-based Fulham Football Club, and landed on a cover of Forbes magazine in 2012 as the Face of the American Dream.Now, Khans bumper-and-headlight maker is one of five suitors for Tokyo-based Takata, which is looking for a buyer after some of its devices ruptured and killed at least 16 people, prompting repairs that could exceed 100 million devices worldwide, according to a person familiar with the matter.Flex-N-Gate, which doesnt make airbags, will go up against established suppliers such as Stockholm-based Autoliv Inc., Chinese-owned Key Safety Systems Inc. and Japans Daicel Corp. Private equity firms KKR & Co. and Bain Capital, partnering with Daicel, are also said to have submitted bids.Automakers may prefer an established company as a buyer compared with Flex-N-Gate, said Kavan Mukhtyar, a management consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Mumbai who has advised on strategy and operations in the automotive industry. But considering its global aspirations, Flex-N-Gate can offer better valuations. And in a deal, valuation plays a critical role.Proposals from Takata buyers are being discussed at meetings scheduled in Japan this week between the supplier and automakers including Honda Motor Co. The central issue for the airbag makers customers is how those takeover bids divide up the responsibility for billions of dollars in recall costs and liabilities.Representatives for Flex-N-Gate and Takata declined to comment on the bids. Flex-N-Gate declined to make Khan available for an interview.Track record
A lack of a track record in making airbags may count against Flex-N-Gate in its bid for Takata, said Koji Endo, an analyst with SBI Securities Co. in Tokyo. Airbags are an area where the margins are relatively high and the hurdles for new entrants are also high, Endo said.Automakers have said ensuring a stable and reliable supply of airbags is one of their top priorities, even as they seek longer-term engineering solutions and to diversify their supplier base.Khan may be able to make up for a lack of experience in airbags with the work ethic thats propelled his career, according to Jim Womack, whos authored several books on lean manufacturing and has spoken with the billionaire about his upbringing in Pakistan.Khan recalled playing golf with his father where fairways were lined with beggars whod throw back errantly hit balls in exchange for tips. Womack said Khan left for America to escape a country where one couldnt lose.Driven guy
He can walk through a factory and have a real sense of whats going on, unlike a thousand CEOs Ive met whove never done what some of us would call real work, said Womack, the founder of and senior adviser to Lean Enterprise Institute Inc. Hes a driven guy. Not an awful guy but hes in this to win.Khan, whose father sold surveying equipment and mother was a math professor in Pakistan, began working for Flex-N-Gate while still an engineering student, according to a profile posted on the Jacksonville Jaguars website.Flex-N-Gate at the time used to make auto bumpers by welding together different pieces. Khan sought and succeeded in coming up with a seamless bumper that would be easier to manufacture, Khan said on stage in 2014 at Chicago Ideas Week.He left the company to set up Bumper Works, which designed and manufactured lightweight seamless fenders, landing General Motors as its first customer, Khan said at the Chicago forum. Two years later Khan purchased his former employer when it came up for sale and folded Bumper Works into Flex-N-Gate.Business expansion
Over the next decade, Khan led the transition of Flex-N-Gate from an after-market parts producer to an original equipment manufacturer. He expanded by acquiring businesses including mechanical assembly supplier Ventra Group Inc. in 2001, the bumper business from Meridian Automotive Systems in 2009 and a headlamps and taillights business from Ford Motor Co.The company counts major automakers including Ford, Volkswagen AG, Toyota Motor Corp. and Suzuki Motor Corp. its customers and operates 54 manufacturing facilities globally.For Khan, buying Takata will give him an estimated 22% global market share in airbags, a business that Autoliv forecasts may expand to $10.3 billion by 2018 from $9.5 billion in 2015, as emerging markets like India catch up with safety standards in developed countries.Acquiring Takata also would allow Khan to diversify Flex-N-Gates business of supplying front-end modules and plastic parts and into higher-margin segments dominated by a few suppliers.Despite its troubles, Takata has technology, long-standing relationships with clients and plays in a field with very few competitors, said Deepesh Rathore, director at Emerging Markets Automotive Advisors in London. For Flex-N-Gate, this is a good opportunity to diversify into a new component segment. Bloomberg",2016-09-29,a92kAmGXZSkm9Q7FmphFXI,"Shahid Khan, the NFL team owner who made his fortune selling car bumpers, is in the race to rescue embattled Japanese airbag manufacturer Takata

				On a quarterly basis, the net income rose by 2.8%.The companys revenue in Q3 FY17 stood at Rs 11,814 crorea jump of 14.2% on year-on-year basis and 2.6% rise on quarter-on-quarter basis, as against Rs10,341 crore in the same quarter of 2015-16.We continue our robust financial performance with a revenue growth of 3% QoQ and 13.8% YoY in constant currency terms.

Our revenues from fixed price /managed services contracts increased from 61.3% to 63.2% this quarter further strengthening our success in outcome based business model, said C.

-0.3,"Mumbai: Three days after the government invalidated high-value currency notes, banks are unable to meet the demand for new replacements or low-value bank notes. As serpentine queues formed outside the entrances of bank branches and ATMs, embattled bank staff bore the brunt of customer displeasure.
				   
				The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) released a statement saying it had made arrangements to distribute the notes in new Rs2,000 and other denominations across the country, but it also appealed to the public to be patient.The cash crunch is so bad that ATMs even in the corporate offices of a bank ran out of cash. A senior banker who declined to be identified said that being senior management, they were given a packet of Rs20 bank notes to tide over the crunch, but even that is proving to be insufficient.The cash is drying up. But we are taking care of it. There is no need to panic, said Arundhati Bhattacharya, chairman of State Bank of India.It is not panic, but desperation that is leading to the ire of customers, many of whom are unable to get cash out of their bank accounts to pay for small purchases, whether for a loaf of bread or vegetables.This is my fourth attempt to withdraw money today. I had to walk all the way down from my home to attend office, said Siddharth Ganguly, 36, who was waiting in front of an ATM.Another customer, Ashutosh Kumar Mishra, 30, said he had to wait for six hours to get Rs4,000 in exchange for the old, demonetized notes.Bankers and companies that manage and deploy ATMs say that they are facing three major issuesshort supply of Rs100 currency notes, under-utilization of ATM capacity and logistic problems. Most ATMs are working at one-third of their capacity. Also, the cassettes that hold cash in the ATMs have to be reconfigured to dispense new notes. The reconfiguration, which requires the deployment of three people on-site, is in testing phase right now. The process of reconfiguring ATMs across the country could take another 20-25 days. Bank of Baroda, for instance, had filled up only 400 out of its 9,000 ATMs till noon Friday, according to its senior management.Bank staff are being denied leave and are working overtime to ensure that at least those who want to deposit their old notes are able to do so. My uncle died today, but I still had to come to work, said a Punjab National Bank branch manager in Mumbai who didnt want to be named.SBI has accepted total cash deposits of Rs39,677 crore over the past two days (till 6pm on Friday) and exchanged cash worth Rs1,666 crore.Bidya Sapam, Gopika Gopakumar, Sahib Sharma and Vishwanath Nair contributed to this story.",2016-11-12,aHSQhb6ApJiAaUuyGa3bWN,"As serpentine queues formed outside the entrances of bank branches and ATMs, bank staff bore the brunt of customer displeasure",00:30,"Cash crunch: customers seeking currency swamp banks, ATMs"
0.56,"Monsanto India Ltd investors seem very excited about the ownership change. They drove up the stock 35% from Bayer AGs first acquisition proposal to Monsanto Indias parent. Shares of Bayer Cropscience Ltd, the acquirers subsidiary in India are, on the other hand, much more mutedthey are up just 5% in a volatile trade. Why the trepidation?
				   
				First, it is not clear how Bayer AG, the acquirer, will go about Monsantos India business. Monsanto operates through three units in India. One is Monsanto India, the listed entity that sells maize seeds and a herbicide product. The second is Monsanto Holdings Pvt. Ltd, which distributes Bt cotton and hybrid vegetable seeds. The third is Mahyco Monsanto Biotech (India) Pvt. Ltd, a joint venture that sub-licences genetically modified (GM) cotton traits to seed companies.There is no clarity yet on what part of Monsantos business will be aligned to Bayer Cropscience and by what time. Or if the two listed firms will be merged at all.Also, even if Bayer amalgamates the businesses, apart from portfolio expansion and distribution leverage benefits, it has limited chance of deriving a sustainable revenue growth driver immediately.All three Monsanto units right now lack growth drivers. The cotton seeds business is facing prospects of price curbs. The existing GM technology is said to be losing efficacy. To keep up the sales tempo, Monsanto tried to introduce new trait seeds (Ready Flex). But it withdrew the application, objecting to the government proposal to share technology with local firms. The withdrawal is not only a setback for the cotton seeds business, but also for the listed company. The new seed trait is tolerant to Monsanto Indias agrochemical product and would have been sales accretive.Of course, the listed company has a  strong presence in corn seeds and is expected to do well this year, which partly explains the share price surge. But its business is turning more cyclicalit is tied to maize crop acreages and lacks long-term growth triggers. The companys average annual revenues grew by an unexciting 7% in the last three fiscal years compared to Bayer Cropsciences 11% growth.Opening of the Indian market to non-cotton GM seeds will be a breakthrough for the listed company and Monsanto Holdings as well, as they have access to these technologies. But approvals have been pending for long. At best, Monsanto India Ltd can see stable to moderate growth. It lacks any big triggers, which can kick in only when it introduces any new seed traits (non-cotton GM technology). But for that, it has to overcome regulatory hurdles, says Vijayaraghavan G., senior vice-president (research) at IDFC Securities Ltd.According to an analyst with another broking firm, the ownership change can bring a fresh approach to regulatory problems, which can help revive Monsantos India business. Even bereft of regulatory cooperation, Monsanto is expected to benefit from Bayers distribution and marketing. As a combined entity, Monsantos India businesses should be able to benefit from the distribution reach of Bayer, adds Vijayaraghavan.Perhaps the perceived benefits are driving the Monsanto stock, be it the prospect of an open offer or leveraging Bayers marketing reach. For Bayer, the gains can be gradual. The stock may not get an open offer. But the company stands a chance to gain an unparalleled economic advantage in the Indian agriculture inputs market if it wriggles out of the regulatory problems, revives the cotton seeds business and introduces Monsantos proprietary products in the domestic market.",2016-09-18,aKPKtFB5SmsYxcKJsLU94N,There is no clarity yet on what part of Monsantos business will be aligned to Bayer Cropscience and by what time,22:44,Bayer-Monsanto merger: Limited good if curbs stay
-0.41,"Microsofts move to purchase LinkedIn for $26.2 billionthe largest company-for-company acquisition in the technology industry since Hewlett Packards 2002 purchase of Compaqis bringing out the predictable talk of irrational exuberance. But if the deal does indicate a bubble, its not necessarily in tech or in stocks.
				   
				First, the combination actually makes sense on many levels. The companies both cater to older, corporate users, and have similar missions, with Microsoft seeking to enable people and businesses throughout the world to realize their full potential, and LinkedIn to connect the worlds professionals to make them more productive and successful. Putting the two together could allow for some significant cost savings: Microsoft could economize a lot simply by imposing some discipline on LinkedIns profligate use of stock-based compensation, which the social-networking company has forecast at about $580 million in 2016, on revenues of between $3.65 and $3.7 billion.Second, this isnt a typical stock-market-bubble deal. In such transactions, a company with an inflated stock price issues equity to fund the purchase of another company with an inflated stock price, often driving the prices of both companies higher on some kind of 1 + 1 = 3 logic. Microsoft, by contrast, is paying for the deal in cash. The stock market, for its part, has initially reacted pessimistically: Microsofts market valuation has fallen more than LinkedIns has risen, leaving the combined entity worth less than the individual companies were on Friday.For a better sense of where the bubble might be, consider how Microsoft is raising the cash to fund the deal. The money will come entirely from new bond issues, adding about $25 billion to a debt load that has already increased by about $15 billion over the past year:Corporate debt issuance has surged since the 2008 financial crisis for a variety of reasons, including central banks easy-money policies, low or negative interest rates in much of the developed world and foreign central banks more recent moves to purchase corporate bonds directly. In the US, corporate bonds outstanding amounted to 27% of gross domestic product as of March 2016, up from 20% at the end of 2007:To be sure, some of the debt issuance is a form of tax arbitrage: instead of incurring tax liabilities by bringing in cash from abroad to pay for stock buybacks, US tech and pharmaceutical companies are instead borrowing the money at home. That said, when a source of funding is too cheap it will be abused, and excess issuance is generally a big danger sign, whether it involves tech IPOs in the late 1990s, mortgage debt in the middle 2000s, energy debt in the early 2010s or corporate debt today.

0.61,"With China making rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI)-based research, it is imperative that India view AI as a critical element of its national security strategy, recommends an August 2016 report titled India and the Artificial Intelligence Revolution. Authored by Shashi Shekhar Vempati of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the report advocates spurring AI-based innovation and establishing AI-ready infrastructure as prerequisites for preparing Indias jobs and skills markets for an AI-based future and securing its strategic interests. 
				   
				Here are highlights from the report:AIs potential in IndiaThanks to the increasingly digital economy, fuelled by improving education and globalization, the Indian consumer is unknowingly the countrys biggest beneficiary of recent advances in AI, notes the report. From utilizing various applications powered by AI to using a range of online services such as Amazon Marketplace and Netflix that learn from consumers online behaviour to make intelligent product and service recommendations, consumers are readily engaged with the proliferation of AI in India, whether they appreciate it or not. Policymakers, however, lag behind, not exploiting AI for national security, public services, or other priorities.Indian academics, public researchers, labs, and entrepreneurs face a different challenge than the corporations that dominate the spacethe infrastructure necessary for an AI revolution in India has been neglected by policymakers.Why China is stealing a march in AI researchWhile lack of physical infrastructure is certainly a major impediment, Indias AI development also suffers from the paucity of the necessary cultural infrastructure, which is key for recent advances from lab to marketplace in AI. Fostering a culture of innovation and a commitment to research and, most important, nurturing an ecosystem beyond the four walls of the organization are all common to Googles DeepMind, IBMs Watson, and Baidus Institute of Deep Learning, the most successful AI projects of the past half decade.While it must come as no surprise that Google, IBM, Microsoft, Facebook, and other global technology giants have invested significantly over the decades in machine intelligence, it is the story of Baidu that holds the most pertinent lessons for India.The story of AI at Baidu is the story of Andrew Ngan associate professor at Stanford University who teaches a popular course on machine learning (also available via Coursera, an online learning platform that he co-founded). Ng was hired away from the Google Brain project in 2014, following which Baidu invested heavily in physical infrastructure. Baidu is investing in deep speech for voice-based searches that leverage speech recognition. This intelligence is being built for understanding and interpreting queries in Mandarin rather than English; as such, Baidu is constructing a uniquely Chinese platform, independent of that which is used ubiquitously in the English-speaking West.This version of AI thus offers the possibility for the development of AI in India, as an example of AI technology successfully developed in and employed by a non-Western nation. Baidus investment in AI research exposes the relative backwardness of Indias technological infrastructure: China has recognized the importance of bridging the gap between the lab and the market while nurturing a research and innovation ecosystem unbounded by national borders and corporate firewalls. India, in contrast, boasts neither the material nor the cultural institutions required for such innovation.Prime Minister Narendra Modi often challenges Indian IT entrepreneurs, asking when India will give birth to the next Google or Microsoft. But until India attains the infrastructure omnipresent in the US, and increasingly existent in China, the deep-learning capabilities necessary to address the vast linguistic diversity across India using machine intelligence may prove elusive.AIs impact on Indian jobsWhile India dreams of its own manufacturing revolution through Modis Make in India programme, it is important for policymakers to closely examine how the advent of industrial robots and their impact on manufacturing transformed companies in other developing nations.Consider the case of Foxconnone of the worlds largest contract manufacturers for electronics. In 2015, Foxconn made news when its chief executive, Terry Gou, predicted that 70% of all manufacturing in Foxconns assembly lines would be automated with robots displacing humans. Some back-pedalling later, his estimate was scaled down to 30%. Foxconn is among the top owners of robotics patents filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and produces thousands of industrial robots a year that in aggregate are capable of performing more than ten types of manufacturing tasks. This is expected to have a significant impact on the workforce: as many as 60,000 workers have been displaced by robots in one Foxconn factory alone in the Kunshan region of China.China was projected to have more installed industrial robots by the end of 2016 than any other country, with more than 30 robots for every 10,000 industrial workers. If China were to increase that density, employment would be further damaged.While the dire predictions of a robot takeover of manufacturing have not come to pass, the reality of automation is that manufacturing is unlikely to create jobs at the scale that it did in the past. Quoting the US Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2013 on future employment projections, Darrell M. West of the Center for Technology Innovation at Brookings highlights how jobs will decline over the next decade in manufacturing and information technology among other sectors.Writing in Pacific Standard magazine, Frank Levy, professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, places jobs dislocation on account of AI in perspective when he dismisses the dire projections of a robot takeover. According to Levy, the greatest area of concern for policymakers ought to be the impact of AI on jobs in the middle-skill categoryassembly line workers, clerical workers, and the like. Levy also warns of significant dislocation caused by automation leading to a reduction in an individuals potential for upward mobility. He emphasizes that a good education will be critical to acquire the necessary skills and to be competitive in this evolved labour market.In their book The Second Machine Age, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee make several specific policy recommendations for coping with the job crisis likely to be spurred by AI. A key recommendation of particular importance for India, given Modis Startup India initiative, is the need to restart startups. Brynjolfsson and McAfee view creative destruction inherent within the start-up economy as the best bet for experimenting with the new jobs and industries that can thrive in an AI-driven economy. The authors provide examples of start-ups such as TaskRabbit and Airbnb that contrive previously non-existent economic opportunities for ordinary people with spare time and assets, thus creating economically productive work.Skill development for future jobsNot everyone is as sanguine as Brynjolfsson and McAfee about the coming AI revolution. The recent victory of AlphaGo (a computer program developed by Google DeepMind) over the world champion in Go has prompted fears of the threat posed by intelligent machines that are capable of superhuman tasks. The direst warning comes from noted physicist Stephen Hawking, who apocalyptically predicts the end of the human race with the development of full artificial intelligence.In the provocative book Humans Need Not Apply, Jerry Kaplan, an American computer scientist and futurist, explores this and several other questions while attempting to paint a picture of an apocalyptic future and what it might look like if and when machines take over. Specifically, Kaplan raises two issues that should be of interest to policymakers in India. The first is the education system and the second involves skills and jobs. While discussing the likely impact of AI on labour markets, Kaplan poses the radical question: Is the current system of sequential education and work outdated, and does it require an overhaul?In his book, Kaplan also proposes a so-called job mortgage as a new type of financial instrument through which employers, vocational schools and colleges would have an incentive to collaborate in a new way. In this proposed job mortgage market, Kaplan attempts to use free market mechanisms to match current skills acquisition to future job opportunities. He proposes to accomplish this by compelling employers to commit to an intent to employ an individual in the future if that person commits to acquire a specific set of skills over a certain time frame. India will have to experiment with the kind of innovative instruments that Kaplan proposes if it is to prepare itself for the challenges from a machine intelligence-driven economy in the near future.",2017-01-23,bEcUIEcRE25IIfxv8OiXtO,"With China making rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI)-based research, it is imperative that India view AI as a critical element of its national security strategy",05:19,Why India needs an AI policy
0.41,"Mumbai: Aster DM Healthcare Ltd, which runs hospitals in India, the Philippines, and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, is likely to defer its proposed initial public offering (IPO) because of concerns over valuation of its overseas operations from which the company derives a large part of its revenues, two people aware of the development said on condition of anonymity. 
				   
				Aster DM had filed for an IPO in June last year and had received approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in November. According to the people cited above, the company was looking to raise close to $300 million from the IPO, valuing the company at around $2.5 billion. The IPO was planned for early this year, before the end of the March quarter.The key reason for the delay in the IPO is the current market condition of its overseas business, especially in Saudi Arabia, which has been badly hit by the fall of oil prices, said one of the two people. As a result, the company has decided that going ahead with the IPO will adversely impact its valuation. It has asked bankers involved in the IPO process to go slow till further notice, the person added.Responding to an email query, a spokesperson of Aster DM said, There is no change in IPO plans and we will look to launch the IPO at an appropriate time, subject to market and business considerations. The company did not disclose any timeline for the proposed IPO. In contrast, mattress maker Sheela Foam Ltd, which received Sebi approval for its IPO around the same time as Aster DM, listed successfully in December, raising around Rs510 crore.In its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP), Aster DM disclosed that its overseas revenues might be impacted due to fall in oil prices globally. The company said that in Saudi Arabia, where a substantial portion of its revenues are derived from patients referred and funded by the ministry of health, a decline in oil prices and the overall economic conditions have had a direct impact, resulting in an increase in receivables from the ministry of health. In order to counter this, the company said it was exploring other business opportunities in Saudi Arabia, including increasing its share of private insurance and walk-in patients. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully secure alternative sources of revenue in Saudi Arabia, or at all, the company disclosed in the draft prospectus.Aster DM has a diversified portfolio of healthcare facilities, consisting of six hospitals, 83 clinics and 180 retail pharmacies in the Gulf Cooperation Council states, seven multi-speciality hospitals and three clinics in India, and one clinic in the Philippines as of 31 March 2016. Asters hospitals in India are located in Kochi, Kolhapur, Kozhikode, Kottakkal, Bengaluru and Hyderabad and are operated under the Aster, MIMS or Prime brands. Its clinics in India are located at Kozhikode and Bengaluru.Aster DMs operations in India, which primarily consist of hospitals, accounted for only 12.52% of the companys total revenues in the nine months ending 31 December 2015, according to the draft prospectus. For the financial year 2014-15, GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries contributed Rs3,447.8 crore to revenue, compared with a contribution of Rs427.9 crore by the Indian operations. The company has received investments from PE funds Olympus Capital Asia Investments Ltd and True North (previously known as India Value Fund Advisors). Both PE funds were expected to dilute a part of their stake along with the promoters in the IPO.Since December 2016, four healthcare services firms have tapped the primary markets to fund their expansion plans and provide an exit to their PE investors. Collectively, these firmsDr Lal Pathlabs Ltd, Narayana Hrudayalaya Ltd, HealthCare Global Enterprises Ltd and Thyrocare Technologies Ltdhave raised almost Rs2,375 crore. In December, a Mint report citing Investec, a global specialist banking group, said that Indias healthcare sector will see investors looking to exit close to $3 billion of primary investments in the next two-three years through secondary sales and public market listings.",2017-02-03,bOEhXYcgzr8pWHdBOVb78K,"Aster DM Healthcare was looking to raise close to $300 million from the IPO, valuing the company at around $2.5 billion ",00:50,Aster DM defers IPO plans over valuation concerns of overseas operations 
0.5,"A revolution is brewing in the financial ecosystem that will extend the benefits of formal financial services to the masses. Global trends suggest that the banking and financial services sector are undergoing the change that the telecom sector witnessed a few years ago. A number of OTT (over-the-top) players came up with innovative solutions to provide a comprehensive communication experience. They leveraged the infrastructure created by telecom service providers and provided value-added services to consumers. Similar innovation is happening in payments and other financial services.
				   
				Traditionally, the banking system has had a stringent regulatory environment. This is beginning to change as regulators take cognizance of the innovation in the area. Companies providing value-added services over and above bank accounts for customers are getting good traction. These companies are coming up with constantly improving technology, data analytics and lean processes to provide high-quality services at an economical cost. Financial services can be divided broadly into two segments. The first category consists of frequently used services like payments, cash in, cash out, etc. These services will witness innovation in the area of customer experience. For example, payment being made through a QR (quick response) code-based solution enhances the experience of making a payment and has the potential of reducing a consumers reliance on cash. The second category consists of long-haul services like lending, insurance and cash management. This category will witness innovation that can extend the reach of these services to the masses. A company giving a personal loan based on utility-bill payment history or extending a working capital loan to a merchant based on its digital transaction history comes in this category. Companies are banking on their ability to provide such services to a hitherto untouched market. In India, the pace of this change is even more rapid due to the favourable combination of a government policy environment, a progressive banking regulator and the emergence of innovative fintech companies. The percolation of financial services to every citizen will happen the way it did with telecom services. The pace will only accelerate. Aadhaar is going to play an important role in this change. Innovation and regulation balance out each other and grow together. Innovation solves restrictions and regulation sets boundaries to safeguard consumers. When both innovation and the regulatory environment move in sync, the service delivery goes to the next level. The emergence of wallets, payment banks and small finance banks is the result of such synchronous movement of innovation and regulation.A large segment of the population will enjoy the benefits of formal financial services for the first time. The first step in this direction has already been taken with Jan Dhan accounts. Digital payments through various instruments like wallets, UPI (unified payment interface), cards, etc, are growing consistently. The last few months have demonstrated that consumers are willing to become digitally savvy if the right solutions are provided. A critical mass of consumers and merchants is getting comfortable with digital payments and apprehensions have reduced significantly in a short span. This is leading to a network effect and unprecedented growth in the digital ecosystem.Digital payments are leading to access to credit through formal channels for consumers and merchants who were unable to get this benefit till now. There is similar innovation in the areas of insurance and wealth management, where the focus is on increasing penetration of these services. For, services like wealth management have remained limited to a select segment. Technology companies are developing ways to provide such services to consumers irrespective of the quantum of their wealth. This is being made possible through technology innovation that renders the incremental cost of acquiring and servicing a customer negligible. Effectively, the reach of financial services and consumer experience is going to improve drastically in the country.Vijay Shekhar Sharma is the founder of PaytmThis is part of a series of articles in Mints 10th anniversary special issue that look at India 10 years from now.

0.35,"New Delhi: India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) launched on Monday by the Union finance minister Arun Jaitley is the second payments bank to commence its operation in the country after Airtel Payments Bank (APB), which was launched on January 12.
				   
				IPPB has been set up as a 100% Indian government-owned public limited company under the department of posts with the aim to open around 650 new branches in postal district headquarters. Currently, the department of posts has an existing network of around 1,55,000 post offices. The new branches will be co-located with the existing post offices. On Monday, it launched services on a pilot basis in Raipur and Ranchi.APB, on the other hand, is a joint venture between phone services provider Bharti Airtel Ltd and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. The payments bank went live with a network of 250,000 banking points. In the pilot phase, the bank added over 1 million customers, according to a statement by the company. As mandated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the new model of banking focuses on providing basic financial services such as all kinds of payments; including social security payments, utility bill payments, remittance services, current and saving accounts up to a balance of Rs1 lakh, distribution of insurance, mutual funds, pension products and acting as business correspondent to other banks for credit products especially in rural areas and among the underserved segments of the society.However, there are distinct differences in the business models of both the payments bank. Mint compares the charges levied and interest rates offered by both the payments banks for rendering different services, including deposits and withdrawals.APB charges Rs5 to Rs25 for cash withdrawals less than Rs4,000 and 0.65% of the withdrawal amount which is equal to or greater than Rs4,000. IPPB does not charge anything for cash withdrawals from its branches and ATMs. However, it charges Rs15-35 for rendering doorstep banking (cash based) for both deposits and withdrawals up to Rs10, 000.The remittance charges levied by both the banks also differ. APB lists charges for transactions made through internet banking, through the app and USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) or *99# whereas IPPB also recognizes transactions through NEFT (National Electronic Funds Transfer), IMPS (Immediate Payment Service), AEPS (Aadhaar enabled payments system) and UPI (Unified Payments Interface).Only transactions up to Rs10, 000 is permitted through AEPS which is free. According to IPPB, banking charges at branch and doorstep for each NEFT based transaction ranges from Rs2.5-5 and Rs5 is charged for every transaction via IMPS.APB charges 0.5% of the amount transferred within its payments bank whereas 1% of the amount transferred is charged for transfer of funds from APB to other bank accounts through banking points.Customers of IPPB can withdraw amount up to Rs10,000 from an ATM in a single transaction and up to Rs25,000 per day. APB, on the other hand, has set Rs10 as the minimum cash withdrawal amount, there is no clarity on the upper limit to cash withdrawals.APB offers an high interest rate of 7.25% p.a. on deposits on savings accounts which is higher than the interest rate offered by traditional banks on fixed deposits.IPPBs interest rates have been fixed as 4.5% if the quarterly average balance is up to Rs25,000, 5% if it is between Rs25,000 and Rs50,000, and 5.5% if above Rs50,000.",2017-01-31,bvQa9dbOiZxQA6DBXNazoJ,A comparison of the charges levied and interest rates offered by India Post Payments Bank and Airtel Payments Bank for rendering different services,10:02,How does India Post Payments Bank stack up against Airtel Payments Bank 
0.69,"Mumbai: Bajaj Auto Ltd, Indias second largest motorcycle maker, on Tuesday posted muted earnings for the three months to December as it sold fewer vehicles following the governments demonetization move.
				   
				Net profit in the third quarter fell 4.74% to Rs924.6 crore from Rs970.61 crore a year ago. Total income fell 9% to Rs5,354.13 crore from Rs5,884.25 crore. Overall sales volume dropped nearly 10.49% to about 851,000 units.The earnings, however, beat analysts estimates. A Bloomberg consensus of analysts had estimated net profit of Rs851 crore.With a good monsoon season and the implementation of the Seventh Pay Commission, the motorcycle industry was expected to record healthy growth. However, post demonetization in November and December, domestic sales of motorcycles and commercial vehicles recorded a decline of 16% and 32%, respectively, the company said in a statement to the BSE.Moreover the outlook remains muted. It will take a few more months for sales to revive, said S. Ravikumar, senior vice-president, business development, without providing a specific timeline. Ravikumar is hoping the Union governments budget will be consumption oriented, putting more money in the hands of the people. All areas where demonetization is hit is clear, how the finance minister alleviates those areas would be interesting to see, he said.However, with the sales mix getting skewed and reflecting more urban purchases of high-end motorcycles, the company managed to maintain its operating profit margin at 22% from a year ago. Operating profit fell to Rs1,131 crore from Rs1,235 crore a year ago.The results are very good, ahead of our expectations, said Nitesh Sharma, analyst autos and auto components, PhillipCapital (India) Pvt.

0.25,"At a regulators round table at the Mint Annual Banking Conclave held in Mumbai on 23 January,  former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor D. Subbarao and former Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chairman C.B. Bhave talk about the impact of demonetisation, the move towards a cashless economy and the autonomy of RBI in a session moderated by Mints consulting editor Tamal Bandyopadhyay. Edited excerpts: 
After demonetisation, everybody is talking about growth slowing down. The latest one was the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which said 100 basis point growth will be compromised this year, another 150 basis points next year. India will lose the tag of the fastest-growing economy in the world. In fact, Moodys said India will continue to remain the fastest-growing economy. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) estimates say that demonetisation impact will be 50 basis points. Can you please tell me how short will be the short-term pain and how long will it take the long-term gain, and what kind of gain do you see? Subbarao: On the growth numbers itself, I must admit I have not crunched the numbers but I have seen fair estimates, from Dr Manmohan Singh in Parliament saying loss of GDP (gross domestic product) will be 2 percentage points, to RBI saying that it will be 5% but the consensus seems to be above 1 percentage point of GDP. What is quite clear though, on which there is lot of agreement, is even though we might lose some GDP in one year, recovery will be quite V shaped as we are already seeing that V-shaped recovery, there will be no hysteresis in the sense that once economy is remonetised we will get that trend, loss if any will be one-third loss. Of course, that will be a huge loss. Apart from the loss to GDP, hundreds of million less privileged in the country had endured pain and hardship, and also economic loss. Cost of demonetisation has been direct in the short term, the benefits are uncertain and unquantifiable. The question is: Will the net cost-benefit calculus be positive. The hope is that it will be positive provided two things happen. The way I look at two methods I use for assessing the success of demonetisation. The first is to what extent this process destroyed or detected (black money). Second, to what extent is regeneration of black money prevented by demonetisation as everyone has said tax black money, act on time, it does nothing to prevent allegations, it puts a fear like Chinese say they killed a chicken to scare the monkey. So if there is fear in people creating black money that they are going to get penalized, benefits will be quite substantial. So you are saying that demonetisation should not be the end of it, there should be a series of it?Subbarao: Absolutely. You know already in reports about people generating (black) money, all the people who come down the system and are detected to have black money. There should be a trail on them. There should be other mechanisms. GST (goods and services tax) itself might be a big instrument in spotting black money. There should be other audit trails, investigating agency, tax agency. They must use technology. Most of all, the government must create a fear in people that if they indulge in black money creation. If some people are caught in this operation, it would be great. How do you see the economy in the next few quarters? In a democracy, we actually need to create fear to implement thingsis this the right way to do something?Bhave: Firstly, I am not an economist. From what I read of estimates that have come out, nobody has a clue. People are still gauging what the impact will be. As third-quarter results of listed companies come out, we will get some indication. There is about one month and eight days of a quarter, which is normal. Sectors likely to be affected will be cash dependent. Initially, unlisted portion of the economy, informal sectors will be affected more. I neither believe in extreme forecast of 3%, also some people who are saying its marginal impact, I think we are going to land somewhere in between. If you say by 31 March that quarters results will reveal the impact, isnt that too early?Bhave: (With) March results, which will come out in April, you will know two things. One, the full impact of demonetisation disturbance on companies and the way the economy is recovering because we need to know both these things (to know) what kind of debate it is going to have. Lot of people are hoping that the recovery will be V-shaped and you will see the recovery coming up as fast as the downturn came in. I dont know.Do you have anything to say to what Dr Subbarao said about a series of measures as a follow-up and you need to create fear among people, black money hoarders. Is this the way forward? Do you agree with that?Bhave: I agree with Dr Subbarao completely that we need to address the flow problem as well. My take on the issue of corruption is that this is probably the most important issue which we tend to ignore. Secondly that in our conversation we discuss it as something outside of the room, not realizing all of us in the room are responsible directly or indirectly for generation of unaccounted money. This has infested our body politics, our social body to such an extent (where) we are in such a state (that) you have a patient with (his) body entirely infected... lets say, these are the two conditions. You should not operate on so small a part that as soon as you finish the operation, rest of the body gets infected again; you should not operate on such a large body part, that patient himself will be dead. As if these two conditions were not enough, the knife I am giving you has also poison on it, the machine through which you have to implement is also an issue and, therefore, we are only going to find a long-term answer to it. I agree with Dr Subbarao that we need to initiate the step, but dont expect quick results from it.If you remember Prime Ministers 8 November address to the nation, demonetisation was about fighting terror financing, fighting counterfeit notes, terrorism. There was no reference to a cashless economy. There was speculation how much money we will get.  Then we see the lottery is used to promote the drive to cashless.Subbarao: If the objective is only to move the economy to cashless, evidently I believe that the motivation of demonetisation was to assault black money. I was also surprised like Tamal that the government in last two-and-a-half months has talked about different objectives at different times and were somewhat muffled in their communication. I would have been quite happy if they said the intent of demonetisation is to attack black money and there are other incidental benefits of demonetisation such as the transition to a cashless economy to an extent which are consistent with our other objectives.In your book you spoke about how Denmark and Sweden are becoming cashless economies. As a former regulator, what is the right way to go towards a cashless economy? Subbarao: Well it is not that I have done extensive calculation on a cashless economy. I must take some pride that I talked about cashless economy before it became such a popular phrase or slogan in our country. I was talking about a cashless economy, of course the benefits of which come out of it including, creating an audit trail. I was talking more in the context of negative interest rate. You go back one year, January/February last year, the big thing around global economy was how negative interest rate is going to work . It will work if you go towards a cashless economy. It was in that context I was motivated to write about economy. I think it is still possible to go towards a cashless economy and pursue the objective of financial inclusion.From economics to logistics, you spoke about the economics part of it. I would like you to tell us about the logistics part. Being chairman of NSDL (National Securities Depository Ltd), you are somehow the architect of dematerialized shares in India. That was a humongous task at that point of time, physical shares transition to demat, scale was much smaller but there may be some similarities. Are there lessons to be learnt from your demat exercise in terms of sequence?Bhave: Its an interesting question. As you rightly said that we cant really compare the two. When we went in for the demat process, we had about 20 million customers. Today, even if you take the adult population as 500-550 million people, there is that difference. The other important difference is that, in the entire implementation of the demat process ... it was between the regulator and the actors in the demat process like stock exchanges and NSDL, etc. who arrived at most of the decisions. The impact it makes is that when you dont have the sovereign, you cant compel people to do something. You need to do things in the provision of the law. The Demat law said the investor had a choice in either physical or demat form. We had to stay clear of this. Sebi doesnt get as much credit for this work but under (D.R.) Mehtas chairmanship Sebi adopted an absolutely collegial approach to this. We never got the feeling that we were not heard. Third important point is that at such times, the incentive for an actual player is to push for more and more. But in practical terms, considering the size of the country reach it is wiser to go step by step. NSDL played that role, said no many times to higher dematerialization because we advised, we will learn from the mistakes. The last point we made sure small investors were not affected by it. Any shareholder can sell shares up to 500 in physical form. The Regulator always kept its window open. What you do is 80:20 rule, you are pushing 20% but covering 80% of the market. If I paraphrase you, the sovereign should not have much role in the entire exercise. We need to leave it to executives, you need to go through a consulting process, you need to sequence it properly and in certain segments give them enough time.Bhave: Only the first part. I didnt say that the sovereign should not be a part of it. But I said if the sovereign is part of it, you run across the temptation to compelwhere he is not part of the thing that table will be conscious in progressing.Everybody talks about RBI autonomy, what about Sebis autonomy? In 2010 you tested that. There was a fight between the insurance regulator and Sebi, and you lost it. Was that the reason you didnt get a second term. In my interview, you said chairmen come and chairmen go. How independent is this institution and what is your take on that?Bhave: Ultimately any regulatory institution is a creature of law. So it needs to work within parameters of this law. Every single regulatory law in the country has a provision which says the government can issue directive to this regulator to do something. I am just saying autonomy in a sense is circumscribed by this fact that there is an overlapping provision. In practical terms in my mind autonomy comes from how the leadership of the regulator is removable. The Constitution makers wanted the Election Commission, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India to be independent offices, the Supreme Court judges, they made provision that these people can be removed by two-thirds majority of Parliament before their tenure ends.Are you saying its not the institution but the leader that matters? At the end of the day, the buck stops at the leader. The same institution can have less or more autonomy. Whats the wrestling power of the leader?Bhave: The leader matters certainly, you build institutions with the people. You need people who have that assurance and who know they are not subject to arbitrary removal. They have financial autonomy. In practical terms, autonomy is also determined by what kind of personality people are dealing with issues. People who are sensitive to institutional importance would deal with the same issue in a different way. Subbarao: I cant just give a binary answer. I think the perception is much more than the reality. And that perception arises from the fact that there is a section of the law under which the government can issue any instruction to RBI that it considers in public interest, but after consultation with the governor. In the last 80 years of RBI history, Section 7 has been quiet inconsequential. That section has never been invoked. The government has never given any instruction invoking Section 7. The belief that RBI is not autonomous because some section is in law, is completely misread. Sometimes there is pressure on RBI to do things that it is not comfortable in doing. I believe RBI is and should be autonomous in close domains of RBI mandates. Monetary policy, regulation of financial institutions, payment systems on those issues categorically mandate RBI is autonomous and should not bend to the pressure. Over the last eight years from Sir Benegal Rama Rau to Dr Raghuram Rajan, RBI has maintained the tradition of enforcing autonomy.You have agreed that its this perception that RBI ends up compromising Subbarao: There is misinformed perception that RBI doesnt enjoy autonomy and that perception gets strengthened because of repetition. There is responsibility both on part of the government and RBI to manage and improve this perception. Doing what it believes is in the best public interest no matter what the government believes should be done.That is number one. First of all, I think body language used should be very mesh. Second, public criticism of Reserve Bank is powerful of course. RBI is a policy institution, it makes policy that affects the lives of millions of people. But there is one exception. The government should not criticize the RBI governor because that is detrimental to macroeconomic management. If the markets believe that there are differences between the government and RBI, that is not constructive but destructive. The government, if it has any concerns about RBI policy management, that should be internally managed.You said that in the history of RBI, 80 years now and Sebi, 25-plus years, section 7 was never used. I will ask now a counter question. Why do I need to use section 7? If I advise and you listen to me, in a short notice it is actually a threat.Subbarao: I think it is exaggerated. On what basis you say RBI autonomy has been touched upon in question of demonetisation. RBI board has taken half an hour, I dont know exactly. There is no experience. This was a decision that was taken on judgement. There were people on RBI board. I want to ask a counter question. How long does the Union cabinet take to approve the Union budget? 15 minutes. How long does a state cabinet take to approve state budget? 10 minutes. I can tell you because I was finance secretary of state and finance secretary to state governor.I believe that the RBI board must respect that they have taken a considered decision. The governor himself has said that they were in consultation with the government for the past several months. Its like the army preparing for battle and the decision to attack takes place in a very short period of time. That is exactly what has happened, I am not an insider anymore. I believe they have been preparing for long time.",2017-01-30,cEDJ5YKqm297EuY9w9ZsxM,"Former RBI governor D. Subbarao, former Sebi chairman C.B.

-0.44,"The post-demonetization narrative that initially saw banks as the biggest beneficiaries of a deposit delugea massive Rs12.4 trillion at last counthas now morphed into a more balanced one now.
				   
				Deposits are a cost until you get the money off your back through lending and that is not happening. Business was hard to come by in 2016 for bankers and 2017 is going to be even harder. Companies have stopped borrowing and the few who did, borrowed from the bond market. Bankers themselves are preoccupied with fixing bad loans rather than going after new customers. As a consequence, the loan book expanded at an unflattering single-digit pace. But the currency withdrawal worsened it to 5.76% as of 9 December, a glacial pace not seen in more than half a century.So, banks have now opted to go all out to stoke the dying embers of credit offtake by cutting lending rates. And the cuts are not the typical piecemeal affair, but a deep slash unseen in many years. State Bank of India dropped its benchmark lending rate by a massive 90 basis points and others such as Dena Bank, Union Bank of India and Punjab National Bank have followed suit. Eventually, everyone else will begin cutting rates too.Bankers and analysts seem to think that this will light a fire under the bank loan book. Firstly, many bankers are betting on pent-up demand and expect retail loan growth to gallop once the dust settles on demonetization. This is quite possible as most individuals would have postponed their discretionary spending to a future date. Two weeks into demonetization, retail loan growth slowed to 15.2% from 18% a year ago, data on credit as of 25 November from the Reserve Bank of India showed.Secondly, pockets like affordable housing will do well because currency withdrawal has dampened real estate prices to some extent and the government aims to boost rural housing under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. Indeed, home loans in the priority sector grew by 6.6% in November, a bit faster than 6.1% a year ago and this is a credible sign of the affordable space performing better.In all this, the cost to banks will be an erosion of margins but this will be minimal. Banks have already cut deposit rates deeply and the loan rate cuts announced since Friday were expected. Also, analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd point out that under marginal cost-based lending rate, banks can choose interest rate reset dates and in retail loans, these are elongated. This means that transmission will take time.Which is why investors may soon return to bank stocks despite the shares taking a beating on Monday.",2017-01-03,cFqxiOG42uSxFrAfjuxh2I,"And the cuts are not the typical piecemeal affair, but a deep slash unseen in years",07:52,Are lending rate cuts a desperate attempt to stoke the dying embers of credit offtake?
0.04,"In a past column, I touched upon what has come to be known as the digital divide between the haves and the have-nots and suggested that it may be time for a supra-national body similar to the World Health Organization to be constituted to help govern the world of technology. My argument is that, to some degree at least, technology is a public good, just as basic health is, and its benefits need to be shared across a larger swathe of the worlds population.In a scathing article in the Financial Times last week, Chandran Nair, founder of the Global Institute for Tomorrow, argues that the technology giants of today such as Microsoft completely ignore the fact that the majority of the worlds populationespecially those in developing countriesare still stuck in a pre-industrial age, and that technology as the developed world knows itsearch engines, e-commerce, artificial intelligence, virtual reality and so onare of no use to people who have to still practise pre-industrial techniques such as slash-and-burn farming in order to survive. I must have been reading his thoughts.He talks of the yearly haze that blankets countries such as Singapore and Malaysia when farmers in Indonesia burn their oil palm crop every year so that they can plant anewwhile developers and IT executives sit in air-conditioned rooms and hold conferences about the future of technology, blissfully unaware of pre-industrial age social problems, such as where to find a toilet. He claims that when a question about this deep digital divide was posed to Microsoft, the spokespersons answer was: This is a question for a futurist to ponder, and not one for technologists to worry about.The lopsided distribution of technology benefits is a known fact, but regulators are flummoxed with how to deal with the problem. Regulationor governmental activismto date has been focused only on three vectors. First, the attempt to break monopolistic market power held by a few corporations. Second, an attempt to mop up a larger share of the tax pie when such companies experience enormous profits. And, third, a clumsy attempt to protect privacy by forcing data on customers to stay in the country where it was first generated.At the beginning of this century, Microsoft was hit by US regulators who found that its Internet Explorer, which was bundled with Windows software, was an attempt to shut out other Internet browsers, and forced to pay a hefty fine for indulging in monopolistic practices. The European Union (EU) is now trying to force search engines to not use their market power to coerce content providers such as news organizations to provide their information for free on their search engine sites. YouTube has been banned in China, and Google simply shut down operations in Spain when the Spaniards tried to charge a levy on Google aggregating content from news organizations and then providing this news for free for users of its search engine or mobile operating systems.Tax legislation, sometimes even grand-fathered to defeat judgements handed down by an apex courtas happened in the famed Vodafone India tax caseis an example of a national government going to great lengths to use policy to widen its tax net, or the second vector.We now have WhatsApp using a change in its privacy policy to hand over its users information to Facebook, its parent, after first claiming that no one, not even WhatsApp, can see the content of the messages that its users send to one another. WhatsApp, of course, claims that this data is only going to be used for it to explore ways in which its users can interact with businesses that matter to them without being subjected to third-party banner ads and spam. Well, okay, but Daddy Facebook is even rumoured to have algorithms that can predict when two of its users are falling in love with one another.Most outsourcers in India are hampered by ham-handed EU privacy laws which mandate that personal data regarding European citizens needs to stay in Europe. Streamlined, supra-national legislation in this areagoverning the capture and use of personal data, and the nature of the myriad personal relationships that individuals have with one another onlinewill be necessary soon. The present clumsy laws need to change.Regulation has not yet addressed the fourth vectorthe use of technology for the common good. In one of my recent discussions with Kashyap Kompella, a researcher at The Real Story Group, he spoke of the need for an Indian Technology Service to be included among Indias civil service agencies. This, he argued, could support the formation of unified policies for bringing technological benefits to the poor, as well as making sure that data privacy issues are managed with no negative impact on the citizenry.My take is that while such national, governmental bodies are necessary so that each country can form its own technology policies, there are certain aspects of the rapid advance of technology that can only be governed and managed through supra-national bodies that ensure a modicum of egalitarian distribution of the positive aspects of technology (i.e. technologys characteristics as a public good) and the negative aspects (data piracy, identity theft and other such public dangers posed by cyber criminals) are policed and kept to a minimum. In all seriousness, I would vote that China be the first president of this body.Siddharth Pai is a management and technology consultant.",2016-08-30,cMteXq54s65H6QzfVvn49N,"The lopsided distribution of technology benefits is a known fact, but regulators are flummoxed with how to deal with the problem

For perspective: advertising revenue, accounting for 56% of the total revenue, grew 29% compared with the past year. Ad revenue is expected to grow at 22.2% yoy (year-on-year) on a base of 15% yoy, Edelweiss Securities Ltd had said in its March quarter preview. A combination of premium content/properties during the quarter and overall viewership share increases helped the companys ad revenue growth beat expectations. The launch of Hindi general entertainment channel &tv did help advertising growth in FY16, says Mihir Modi, chief finance and strategy officer at Zee Entertainment.
				   
				On the other hand, subscription revenue, accounting for 39% of total revenue, increased at a relatively slower pace of 16.4%. Zee Entertainment derived its remaining revenue from other sales and services, the share of which dropped to about 5% compared with 12.4% in past years quarter. Overall revenue increased by about 14% to Rs.1,532 crore. Still, a decline in advertising and publicity expenses, and other expenses boosted operating profit performance.Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) increased as much as 53% year-on-year to Rs.414 crore.  Kotak Institutional Equities and Edelweiss Securities were expecting an Ebitda of Rs.372.7 crore and Rs.366.8 crore, respectively. Nevertheless, a higher tax outgo and rising depreciation costs together with a decline in other income meant net profit growth was much slower at 13% to Rs.260 crore.What next? What will really be worth watching is whether ad revenue growth performance is sustainable in fiscal year 2017. That should influence the stock, which has outperformed the benchmark Sensex in the past one year. Zee Entertainment expects industry advertising revenue to grow by 15-16% this year, a rate similar to last year. While it is true that the likes of Patanjali are adding to advertising momentum from FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) sector, some others in the FMCG space have slowed down; so, we expect stable performance from FMCG sector this year, says Modi. Also, its worth noting that advertising momentum from e-commerce firms is likely to soften, which would be compensated by better performance from auto and telecom sectors, he adds.Nevertheless, valuations seem to be capturing much of the optimism.

0.1,"New York: Anshu Jain, the former Deutsche Bank AG co-chief executive officer (CEO), is joining Cantor Fitzgerald LP as president, restarting his career at a much smaller firm after leaving Germanys largest bank amid mounting legal and regulatory problems.
				   
				Jain, 53, will help the closely held company expand in areas including fixed-income and equities trading as well as prime brokerage, Cantor Chairman and CEO Howard W. Lutnick said Monday in a phone interview. The firm is looking to capitalize as stiff regulations force global investment banks, including many in Europe, to pare businesses and pull back from some clients.The ability for us to do business with those accounts is a great opportunity, Lutnick said. We have a great fixed-income business in America, but well expand the number of products in which well do business with our clients. In Europe, well grow our investment banking business, taking Cantor Fitzgerald into the next level. And the firm aims to grow in Asia, he said.Jain helped build Deutsche Bank into Europes biggest securities firm over two decades before stepping down in June 2015 as profitability suffered amid a trading slump, stiffer regulation and years of government probes. His successor, John Cryan, has since scrapped bonus awards for top management, suspended dividend payments, pledged to eliminate thousands of jobs and cut risk-weighted assets at the securities unit to restore investor confidence.Becoming friendsJain said in February he would advise online lender Social Finance Inc., following former Wall Street leaders John Mack and Vikram Pandit in focusing on Silicon Valley ventures looking to disrupt traditional banks. Now, hes jumping to a scrappy Wall Street underdog that survived against long odds after the 11 September, 2001, terrorist attacks killed 658 of its employees  more than two-thirds of its New York-based workforce.Lutnick, 55, rebuilt the firm over more than a decade, sometimes hiring in areas that fell out of favor at bigger investment banks after the 2008 financial crisis. Its core Wall Street business employs about 1,600 people and runs trading desks in financial centers around the globe, according to its website, while the broader companyincluding a variety of financial services and real estate operationsemploys more than 10,000 globally.I have long admired Howards extraordinary leadership and successful efforts as he and his team rebuilt and expanded, Jain said in a statement. As a leading non-bank financial institution, with cutting-edge technology and a global reach, Cantor is well-positioned to capitalize on the changing financial landscape.Lutnick said he became friends with Jain over the past five years and that by late last summer they began talking about the possibility of Jain signing on. He will assume his new post in the coming weeks and work from London, according to a company spokeswoman. Lutnick held the president title in the 1990s.Building capitalThe firm intends to increase the capital it uses to handle client business, according to the statement. It hasnt yet finalized plans for raising the additional funds, Lutnick said. Enlisting Jain shouldnt be seen as an attempt to build something in Deutsche Banks image, he said.This is Anshu doing something different, Lutnick said. Hes already run Deutsche Bank. Hes not trying to recreate that. Hes trying to do something different, and something with a different client focus.Shawn Matthews will remain head of Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., the broker-dealer unit. In the past year hes hired leaders for its debt capital markets business, and he brought on Jefferies Group trader Rohit Bansal to lead a distressed-debt trading group, adding to its leveraged-finance team. The firm added veteran salesmen from Deutsche Bank and Barclays Plc in November to bulk up its fixed-income team in New York.Cantor has also been hiring talent abroad in recent years, adding executives in London. And Lutnick has been seeking to expand subsidiaries including BGC Partners Inc., which in 2015 won an agreement to buy interdealer broker GFI Group Inc. to help handle large trades between banks.Jains riseJain joined Deutsche Bank in 1995 and rose to lead a corporate and investment banking division that produced most of the companys revenue. In 2012, he became co-CEO succeeding Josef Ackermann, who had held the top spot for a decade. A cascade of bad news followed as Jain and co-CEO Juergen Fitschen worked to shore up the banks capital, cut costs and boost returns. The lender was probed for tax evasion in carbon markets, raided by the police and ordered to pay $2.5 billion for its role in rigging benchmark interest rates known as Libor.Within weeks of the Libor settlement, Jain emerged from the annual shareholder meeting with the lowest backing for management by investors in more than a decade. After he stepped down as co-CEO, an executive shakeup followed that saw the exit of other board members and investment-bank leaders.Last month, Deutsche Bank agreed to a $7.2 billion settlement to end a US investigation into its sales of the mortgage securities that helped fuel the 2008 financial crisis. Germanys biggest bank still faces probes into whether it manipulated foreign-currency rates and precious metals prices and whether it facilitated transactions that helped investors illegally transfer billions of dollars out of Russia.

0.72,"Bengaluru: Flipkart chief financial officer Sanjay Baweja resigned this month, barely two years after he joined the online marketplace. Baweja, 56, is a veteran CFO, having held senior roles at Tata Communications Ltd, Emaar MGF and Bharti Airtel Ltd. He was hired to set up badly needed processes and systems, cut losses and prepare Flipkart for an eventual IPO. In an interview, Baweja spoke about why he left Flipkart ahead of plan, his achievements and dismissed allegations of fraud against him. Edited excerpts:
Why leave now?In the past two years, weve been able to expand the market in a big way. Weve been able to bring a lot of new customers into the fold, bringing more cities into play, bringing more pin codes into play. Thats happened because weve been focused on innovation; weve launched new stuff like product exchange, no-cost EMI. Weve built a very strong leadership team, especially in finance. From the time Ive come till now, the processes weve put in place, the standards of governanceits been a remarkable journey. We have the audit on a quarterly basis; the accounting closes on day 4-5 (of a given month); were on our way to SOX compliance (requirement under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the US). So, all of this allowed me to think that now that the company is in strong hands, I can move on to something fresh, something else I wanted to do.Where are you going after Flipkart?Im not at liberty to disclose that as of now.Much of the senior management that oversaw Flipkarts disastrous performance in the year ended March 2016 have been removed or have left. Does your exit have anything to do with this?No, my exit is about what I wanted rather than the other way round.How well prepared is Flipkart for an IPO? Any visibility on when an IPO will happen?Now that I have left Flipkart I cant talk about the timing. But as far as preparedness is concerned, we have transitioned. We are on our SOX compliance road map; we are meeting international standards. Like I said, we are doing quarterly audits, we close our books on a monthly basis on day 5 (of the next month). So, from the structure perspective, which Im used to delivering, were well on our way to being prepared. Now, the preparedness also has to come from a business perspective. Thats where the company will still take some time before it goes on the IPO journey.An anonymous Twitter handle has accused you of fraud and said that your exit was because of this alleged fraud. According to the Twitter handle Unicon Baba, Flipkart, at your behest, paid Tata Communications 30% more than it was paying its previous data centre supplier. Comment?Ive read it and its an absolute load of crap. We have robust processes. When we do an RFP (request for proposal) we invite people to bid for it. In this case, they (Tata Communications) were the only ones who could have delivered. When Chennai went down (during last years floods), our data centre was up and running. We went for the servers that were technically the most superior and lowest cost. I dont know where this 30% is coming from. Theres no inquiry. Nothing of this kind has come up.In the past two years, some senior leaders from established companies  who came to Indian Internet firms havent fit in and have had bitter experiences. Do you regret joining Flipkart?Not at all. Ive enjoyed every bit of the last two years. I enjoyed putting in the frameworks, the processes, the feeling of growing the company. When I was at TCL (Tata Communications Ltd), I had a great time. And then I took the call to come here. So, you take calls at some points in your career. I think Flipkart will go places and I will benefit eventually.ALSO READ | Flipkart CFO Sanjay Baweja resigns, replacement unclear",2016-10-27,cg7uvQRScEay19U9nF8X7O,"Outgoing CFO Sanjay Baweja on why he left Flipkart ahead of plan, his achievements and allegations of fraud against him",04:00,Flipkart is in strong hands now: Outgoing CFO Sanjay Baweja
0.25,"The announcement of the imminent commercial launch of services by its telecom unitReliance Jio Infocomm Ltdat its annual general meeting has augured well for the Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) stock. Its share price has risen 7.5% from its recent low on 2 September. But its worth remembering that the stock has been an underperformer compared to the benchmark Sensex so far this year.
				   
				If you thought September quarter results would change sentiments dramatically, you are likely be disappointed. Stand-alone revenues have declined year-on-year but better operating profit margin, strong other income growth, and decline in finance and depreciation costs have helped the company report 20% growth in its pre-tax earnings. But that wont impress investors. Heres why: stand-alone Ebitda for September quarter came in at Rs10,555 crore. A poll of Bloomberg analysts was expecting the companys Ebitda at Rs10,569 crore. Thats pretty much in line. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.Unlike the June quarter when RILs gross refining margin (GRM) had surprised the Street positively, this quarter was fairly lukewarm. To be fair, GRM of $10.1 a barrel is not bad at all. The companys premium over Singapore GRM has dropped to $5 a barrel from as much as $6.5 a barrel. But investors are unlikely to punish the stock for that. For one, the companys GRM margin is slightly better than some brokerage firms estimates. Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd was expecting a GRM of $10 a barrel while analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd had forecasted a GRM between $9.5-10 a barrel.What really came as a big surprise this quarter is the performance of the petrochemicals business. According to the company, consolidated petrochemicals Ebit margin expanded to a 14-quarter high of 15.2% for the September quarter as product deltas held up well despite lower prices. Delta is the rate of change in prices compared with the change in unit costs. Strong volume growth also helped. Stand-alone petrochemicals Ebit increased to 16.3%, higher sequentially as well as on a year-on-year basis.As usual, the oil and gas business was a laggard, with Ebit declining as much as 83% year-on-year, adversely impacted by lower upstream production in domestic blocks along with lower prices. Sure, RILs organized retail business has done well but the segment is too small to make a big difference to overall numbers.On a consolidated basis, the companys debt service coverage ratio has declined to 0.88 from 2.79 in the June quarter. Is that a worry? According to independent analyst S.P. Tulsian, the decline in debt service coverage ratio should hardly be a concern for a company with RILs cash flows. Other analysts say the fall in the debt service ratio below 1 is just for one quarter and should not be extrapolated.What of the stock? Currently, RIL trades at 12.4 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year. Valuations arent exactly cheap considering that the refining environment is still sluggish. So far this quarter, benchmark Singapore GRM has averaged only marginally higher at $5.3 a barrel, says an analyst. RILs net debt has increased by about Rs10,000 crore sequentially to Rs1.06 trillion. Investors should watch out for that measure in the days to come. It goes without saying that news flow on the telecom ramp-up will be crucial for the RIL stock.",2016-10-21,cseZPkWnNdtky8J0DNe3oI,"News flow on RILs telecom business, Reliance Jio, and its commercial launch, will be crucial for the companys stock",03:48,"RIL meets Q2 results expectations, but all eyes on Reliance Jio"
0.54,"At a time when companies are switching their business models to digital, cybersecurity has become a boardroom concern, for its implications now directly affect the balance sheet. However, its becoming increasingly difficult to objectively quantify a companys cyber risk considering the dynamic nature of an organizations perimeter, which in most cases cannot be distinctively defined thanks to BYOD (bring your own device), BYOA (bring your own access) and Dynamic DNS set-ups among others. The other component hindering quantification is the known unknown attack vectors. 
				   
				Reports estimate that the overall cost of cybercrime will touch $2 trillion (around Rs135 trillion) by 2019. Very recently in India, we saw 3.2 million debit cards being hacked; we have seen the largest bank in the worldJP Morgan Chasebeing hacked even though it spends $300 million on cybersecurity annually. We have seen companies headquartered in the Silicon Valley, built by the best tech minds from around the world, being hackedamong them Yahoo and Twitter. These examples clearly indicate that there is no such thing called 100% security. As in the physical world, the digital world also cannot be secured completely; it will be all about managing and mitigating risks.Cyberspace is continuously changing and evolving. In the future, companies will have to look at a three-dimensional approach of proactively protecting their digital stacks via technology and process-level controls, continuously monitor incidents and events and respond in the quickest and most efficient way possible in case there is an incident. Clear heat maps of data sets versus threat actors such as insiders, competitors, hacktivists, state-sponsored hackers, terrorists, script kiddies and organized criminals will be mapped specific to the industry and the company to prioritize security efforts. At the government level, recognizing the strategic dimensions of cyberspace, the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) created the position of  national cyber security coordinator in 2014, which is a great move. I feel Reserve Bank of India initiatives such as ReBIT (Reserve Bank Information Technology Pvt. Ltd) will enable the much required streamlining of financial services, IT and information security from a regulatory compliance standpoint. The recent push to have an independent payments regulator highlighted in the recent budget by the finance minister is another positive step in this direction.The future of hacking from a techies lens looks very, very exciting. We have already seen an explosion of on-demand hacking services like Haas (hacking as a service), and this will only expand in the future. From script kiddies to a bustling underground marketplace of tailor-made targeted DIY (do-it-yourself) exploits that have 24x7 support, along with the release of continuously enhanced and more sophisticated versions of a malwareits all now just a few clicks and a few hundred dollars away. With other hack enablers such as bot nets readily available to be purchased by the hour, the possibilities of a normal tech enthusiast executing a successful hack go up exponentially.With faster and cheaper computing power readily available, we will see the rise of more complex crypto algorithms with longer key values. This isnt all good news, for complex crypto is always a double-edged swordon the one hand, it does make it hard for a hacker to decipher the data both in motion and at rest; on the other, it becomes extremely difficult to decrypt system files affected by ransomware or doxware.We have been hearing about the shift from a signature-based analysis system to a behaviour and context-based system for quite some time now, but thanks to machine learning and artificial intelligence, I feel we will be able to take tangible steps towards this very soon. AI (artificial intelligence) and ML (machine learning) will also play an extremely important role in real-time learning about individuals from available data over the Internet to create a mind map (which will get more accurate as the data set increases) of an individual you might meet for the first timetaking the entire privacy debate to an absolutely new level. Not to forget the possible implication of an artificial intelligence attack on the Internetsomething thats only a matter of time, in the words of SpaceXs Elon Musk.There will be a clear shift to objective and quantized cyber risk management techniques that will incorporate the known unknowns to make cyber risk an informed business decision. The attack surface will not be restricted to internal IT but will extend to third parties, cloud providers and social media, among others. The focus in the future will not only be on security products but on building secure products from the ground up.The way we are adopting digital, with a clear push coming from the top in both private and public set-ups, technology is going to take centre stage in the success of most new initiatives. And while this happens, the key for the industry will be to learn from cyber attacks and embed the learnings into our defence systems as quickly as possible.

0.97,"Mumbai: A big infrastructure spending push, the boost to affordable housing and a fiscal deficit target of 3.2% of gross domestic product announced in the Union budget came as a big boost to banks. A tax concession on provisions for bad loans also came as a relief for Indian banks which are struggling with gross non-performing assets of around Rs6.7 trillion.
				   
				Banking stocks rallied more than the broader market with the BSE Bankex gaining 2.7%, a full percentage point more than the Sensex.In the budget speech, the finance minister outlined his proposals to create more jobs and boost infrastructure spending, measures which will help increase credit offtake for banks. Government spending on this sector will touch Rs3.96 trillion in the next fiscal. As banks have been struggling with a large number of stressed cases in the infrastructure segment, fresh investments will get the ball rolling and hopefully turn around some of those companies that have been defaulting.ALSO READ: Budget 2017: Jaitley gives infrastructure a massive pushOther measures that will boost credit growth include affordable housing projects being given infrastructure status and the highest target for farm credit at Rs10 trillion. After the governments move to withdraw Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes on 8 November, bank credit growth has fallen to around 5%, the lowest in a couple of decades. Another positive announcement for the banking sector was the governments comparatively tame net market borrowing figure of Rs3.48 trillion in 2017-18, as compared with Rs4.25 trillion in the current year. The net borrowing figure takes into account the securities that will be bought back, Jaitley said.Capital expenditure data provided in the budget document reveals that the gross market borrowing is set at Rs5.8 trillion for the new financial year, which is approximately the same as 2016-17. Jaitley also said the government proposes to increase allowable provision for non-performing asset (NPA) from 7.5% to 8.5%. This will reduce the tax liability of banks, he said. Allowable provision is the amount of bad loan provision that is tax deductible.ALSO READ: Budget 2017: Affordable housing to be given infrastructure statusCapital infusion of Rs10,000 crore for recapitalization of PSU Banks will be a morale booster in scenarios where Banks are in dire need of capital for Credit growth and Basel III compliance.

The budget has set aside only Rs10,000 crore for bank recapitalization, lower than the Rs25,000 crore figure for the current year. The Indradhanush scheme says that state-owned lenders will receive Rs70,000 crore by March 2017 as capital infusion from the government to meet their higher capital requirement under the Basel-III regime.

-1.0,"How does one assess the loss-absorbing capacity of bank capital? One yardstick is to look at net bad loans (i.e. excluding those that have been provided for) as a proportion of banks net worth (sum of capital and reserves on their balance sheets).
				   
				The table, culled from the International Monetary Funds Financial Soundness Indicators, shows that bad loans that have not been provided for make up close to one-fifth of the net worth of Indian banks. That number is among the highest in the Asia-Pacific region. China has a negative number, which means that it has made provisions in excess of bad loans, although that number is highly suspect. But it doesnt say much for Indian banks when those in Congo score much better on this metric.While Indias banks have not reached basket case proportions like those of Greece, the fact is that even this number warrants caution. For one, it doesnt seem to include restructured assets that attract a lower rate of provisions. Second, bad loans position in Indian banks has deteriorated since September last year, which is the date of the data. And third, the overall figure hides the fact that for several state-owned banks, this yardstick is in excess of 100%.As this column has previously shown, including stressed assets, this ratio is as high as 200% for a couple of banks.

0.06,"A few days before Twitters 8 September board meeting, as the companys finance team readied a presentation, it received conflicting directions on a crucial question. Should their slides reflect Twitters prospects as an independent company or delve into the benefits of getting acquired?
				   
				Jack Dorsey, Twitters chief executive officer, argued that the 10-year-old company should remain on its current course and work to capitalize on recent product improvements and success in streaming live video, people familiar with the discussions said. Ev Williams, a former CEO who has a history of clashing with Dorsey, was in favour of exploring a sale. Other directors agreed they had a fiduciary duty to consider that option. The board ultimately decided to consider takeover prospects after getting an expression of interest from a potential acquirer, which led it to hire Goldman Sachs and Allen & Co. to evaluate possible bids.After pitching the San Francisco-based social network, the bankers received inquiries from suitors which so far include Disney and Salesforce, with Google also weighing a potential bid. This week, the board is consulting with other outside advisers on how to deal with the internal disagreement over a possible sale, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the process is private. Formal bids could come within a couple of weeksor not at all.Though its fate is in flux, one thing is clear: A year after he officially took back the reins as CEO, Jack Dorsey has either ceded or lost at least some control over the future of the company he helped create. On the board, he may be overruled by fellow directors on the future of Twitter as an independent company. Within his management team, hes largely delegated command of Twitters strategy to chief financial officer Anthony Noto. And among advertisers, Twitters fortunes are being constrained by its stagnant user numbers, which Dorseys product changes have failed to significantly boost, and by growing concern about harassment and abuse on its service.Also Read: Possible Disney merger with Twitter poses risks for Bob Iger legacyThe lack of growth in users and engagement underscore that Jacks initiatives thus far havent really been effective, said Robert Peck, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. If this whole live idea doesnt work, then what is it that gets Twitter to grow?Twitter spokeswoman Kristin Binns declined to comment on the boards discussions about a potential sale process. Asked to provide perspective on Dorseys progress, Binns said in an e-mail that the CEO has met the goals he outlined a year ago and made significant strides in each of his priorities for the company. The company has been rolling out products faster than ever, she noted, and has boosted engagement through enhancements to the timeline, such as showing people the most relevant tweets first. She also cited the companys advancements and partnerships in live video streaming, including deals to broadcast NFL games and presidential debates.As Twitters first CEO, Dorsey was initially known as a detail-obsessed micromanager. He was ousted in 2008, then brought back to Twitterwhich was having trouble attracting new usersto apply vision and direction with the kind of authority that only a founder can bring.But Dorsey hasnt seemed interested in being the sole authority on Twitters future, according to insiders. While he was away from Twitter, he built a credit-card reader company, Square Inc., and learned the importance of trusting others with strategic decisions. His leadership style in the past year at Twitter has been Socratic, not prescriptive, these people said. Hell ask open-ended questions to spark debate, like, Are we preventing people from expressing themselves fully with our 140-character tweet limit? What would a different solution look like?Also Read: Twitter bidders vying for data would inherit the doldrums tooThe discussions eventually lead to solutions, like Twitters move last month to exclude photos and attachments from a tweets character total. But the process takes time. And that passive, contemplative style created a void in management that Noto has stepped in to fill, people said.Noto has been just as responsible, just as influential at the company as Jack, said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. Hes been unusually active as a CFO.Earlier this year, Noto told Twitters other senior staff that he intended to bid for the rights to stream 10 Thursday night National Football League games. He wasnt expecting to win, but he wanted to try, according to people familiar with the conversations.Noto, who is a former CFO of the NFL, did winfor the bargain price of $10 million, lower than what others were willing to pay. That kicked off a string of other deals in sports, politics and entertainment, centered on making Twitter accessible to a wider audience through live video they can watch for free. The first NFL game drew 2.3 million users, and the next one got 2.4 million, hinting at the potential for a growing audience, according to the company.Its not that Dorsey has been uninvolved. On the contrary, his employees say he answers e-mails so quickly that its difficult to imagine how he has the time, given that hes also still CEO of Square. During his first month at Twitter, he cut 8% of the workforce. He recruited new board members like Debra Lee, the CEO of BET, and Hugh Johnston, the CFO of Pepsico, to add executive experience. Hes helped the strategy by providing a long-term perspective on the business and focused on a single concept to help drive it: live.But if Dorsey is the introverted deep thinker, Noto is the doer. Hes the high-energy cheerleader who has cut through indecision at the company and rallied Twitters employees around a future of live video streaming, boosted by licensing of premium content. (Twitter has partnered with Bloomberg LP to stream some Bloomberg TV shows, as well as the presidential debates.) Its unusual for a companys CFO to be leading its product vision, and even rarer at a technology company.Twitters engineers have long grappled with how to make the service easier to use, cycling through six heads of product in six years. Notos deal-making provided them with a unique solution: to make video an entry point to the Twitter experience. Twitter recently released streaming applications for Apple TV, Xbox and Amazon Fire TV, letting viewers pick content that streams alongside related tweets, and sidestepping the need for people to create an account and decide who to followpreviously a cumbersome prerequisite of using Twitter.Twitter hired Noto in 2014 with more than $60 million in stock options, following a career in banking at Goldman Sachs, where he helped Twitter go public. Its unclear whether Noto supports a Twitter sale. But he did recently retain Goldman to look at other options, like selling off assets besides the core business, according to people familiar. Notos presence at the company has long been a comfort to investors, with many figuring that if it came time to sell, he would know how to get it done.Even as the company gains ground in streaming, Dorsey is being forced to reconsider Twitters future in part because its lack of user growth. US average monthly users have hovered around 66 million for six quarters. Revenue, which more than doubled in 2014, is projected to rise just 15% this year, and to slow further next year.Advertisers see potential in the companys live video strategy, but theyre also being wooed by photo- and video-sharing app Snapchat, and Facebooks Instagram, which has recently become more advertiser-friendly. At the time of Twitters 2013 initial public offering, those services werent close competitors. Now they both have larger daily audiences than Twitter.Also Read: Twitter could take many forms, depending on new ownerTwitter budgets have slowly gone down and down and down, said James Douglas, who consults with advertisers on their spending as executive director of social media for Society, an agency within IPG Mediabrands whose clients include Coca-Cola and Red Bull. Its kind of hard to compel clients who had an experience with Twitter that wasnt good, or have the perception that Twitters audience is declining. Everyone has questions for them, Douglas said.Tom Buontempo, the president of Attention, the social arm of ad firm KBS, said hes seen the trend worsen in recent months. Its all a matter of where people are spending their time, he said. Im starting to hear more clients consider whether or not they need to be on Twitter at all. Attentions clients include BMW, Mattel and Lincoln Financial, though Buontempo wouldnt say who is pulling back.When Twitters CEO search committee was looking to replace Dick Costolo in 2015, they made calls to major investors, asking for input and floating Dorseys name as a contender. Some investors expressed their skepticism, given that Dorsey was already a large influence on Costolo, and could already impact the companys direction through his executive chairman role.Still, one year ago this week, Twitters board was jubilant on a conference call announcing the decision to bring back Dorsey permanently. Dorsey would help us achieve what we see as a massive opportunity to grow the company, Peter Currie, who helped lead the search and has since left the board, said at the time. The board has been pleased and impressed with the strategy, vision and alignment around goals coming from the Twitter teams these last few months, and there is much more the world hasnt seen just yet.Perhaps there is more to come. But some investors havent been willing to wait.Twitters stock had dropped about 20% this year before reports began to surface about the company considering a sale. Even one of its largest and earliest investors, Chris Sacca, a vocal critic of Twitters strategy under Costolo and proponent of bringing back Dorsey, has sold a large part of his stake, he told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday.Brad Slingerlend, who manages the global technology fund for Janus Capital Group, holds Facebook, Google, Amazon and Applebut sold Twitter after Dorsey took over. Social networking, he said, is a business that depends on a network effect to generate growth. If the networks momentum starts to ebb, its difficult to recover.The best-case scenario, Slingerlend said, would be an acquisition by Disney. As Twitter becomes more of a media company, the two make for a good fit, he said. And Disneys CEO, Bob Iger, has experience bringing a brand back to life.Jack is a good entrepreneur, Slingerlend said. But Twitter needs a turnaround CEO, and thats a completely different job. Bloomberg",2016-10-07,dpyqCrv7e3VSybEzZJ4glL,"A year after Jack Dorseys return as Twitter s CEO, live-streaming and new products havent revived growth",19:32,How Jack Dorsey is losing control of Twitter
0.79,"New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modis government is planning a Rs.21,000 crore package of state aid for Indias solar panel manufacturing industry, according to two officials.
				   
				The so-called Prayas initiative, short for Pradhan Mantri Yojana for Augmenting Solar Manufacturing, a central-government plan designed to lift Indias installed photovoltaic capacity as well as to create an export industry, according to two senior government officials with direct knowledge of the plan. They asked not to be identified because the policy isnt yet public.Modi wants to raise renewable capacity to 175 gigawatt by 2022 from 45 gigawatts at present. In addition to meeting its own energy targets, which Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates may cost $200 billion, India wants to emulate industrial developments in neighbouring China, where solar manufacturers have created a world-leading export industry.The Prayas programme, part of Modis Make in India campaign, is intended to create 5 gigawatts of photovoltaic manufacturing capacity from 2019 and build 20 gigawatts of projects in the country by 2026, according to the officials. The policy, which is being developed by the ministry in charge of renewable energy and industrial policy, along with the Niti Aayog government research group, will be presented to the finance ministry within a month before going to the cabinet for final approval, they said.Catching ChinaLast month power minister Piyush Goyal said in Mumbai that a policy to encourage domestic manufacturing of solar equipment is in works. When reached on phone, the spokesman for the power and renewable energy ministries declined to comment.India has become one of the biggest clients of Chinese photovoltaic manufacturers and in the absence of its own domestic capacity, that reliance could potentially grow. In the first six months of 2016, India imported 18% of Chinas production worth $1.1 billion, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.Indias policy proposal, expected to create thousands of jobs, is also in response to the industrys demand for help to the countrys solar manufacturers, one official said, adding that multiple tenders of a few hundred megawatts each would be issued for the manufacture of everything from wafers to modules.Price advantage?The government could offer about Rs.90 lakh a megawatt for manufacturing tenders and Rs.50 lakh a megawatt for local deployment, according to one of the officials, who said the numbers are subject to change.The plan might give a price advantage if the manufacturing-hub logistics are well planned, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst Jenny Chase. Money alone isnt a sufficient incentive for companies to set up the most high-tech automated factories needed to compete, she said.Japans SoftBank Group Corp. told Bloomberg News last month its considering a manufacturing joint venture in India that could produce the solar panels needed to meet Modis energy targets.To build large-scale manufacturing efficiency matching Chinese economics of scale will require government support, Manoj Kohli, executive chairman of SB Energy said in an interview in New Delhi.

The now-worthless notes account for 86% of money in circulation, leaving many Indians with little or no cash.Printing of a new Rs2,000 note is ongoing, but work has only just begun on the replacement Rs500 notes, said an official in the finance ministry, who asked not to be identified because the official isnt authorized to speak to the media. Banknote shortages are likely to continue into next month, the official added. Finance ministry spokesman D.S.

				 When people react to news about chatbots, it has more to do with what they can potentially do sometime in the future, than what they probably experienced with an existing one. The experience would go back a long way. Eliza, a chatbot created in the 1960s, has given endless entertainment to generations of coders during their breaks. In its early days, Yahoo Messenger came with a chatbot. These experiments revealed something about human fascination with machines that can mimic humans. They underscore why the format will work. In the media sector, the Quartz app and The New York Times Facebook Messenger have adopted this format. They have a great user interface, and give the users a distinct feel of chat.But the real disruption is happening at the back-end. If phase one of this change happened through intelligent personal assistants such as Apples Siri, Microsofts Cortana, Amazons Alexa or Google Assistant, phase two is where these assistants become specialists. Bank of America (BoA) announced the launch of its chatbot Erica, which will sit in BoAs mobile app, analyse customers financial data and give recommendations. Similarly, Mastercard announced a chatbot that will work on Facebook Messenger to help solve customers problems. IBM has joined hands with Slack Technologies to make its slackbot more intelligent and be able to help a companys tech department. IBMs computer system Watson will do a good part of data crunching.Watson, which became a part of public conversation a few years ago after winning TV game show Jeopardy, is already crunching data in other verticals. One of the most useful areas it is looking at is oncology, to help doctors treat cancer more effectively.There has long been a debate on whats better, being a generalist or being a specialist. At one point, it seemed that a good personal assistant would be both, a generalist and a specialist. But it looks like that division will persist. But all of them will still fit into our pocket.Economist and professor Pankaj Ghemawat, in his thought-provoking book World 3.0: Global Prosperity, How To Achieve It, pointed to the fact that the world is not flat. Despite all the advances in communication technology, trade and transportation, things tend to stay within the borders. Views on privacy is one such. Recently Alibabas founder Jack Ma urged China to use big data to combat crime. The example he gave included a person using e-payments to travel in 50 different buses in a single day (a potential pickpocket), and a person who orders a pressure cooker, a clock, steel ballsall at the same time (a potential bomb maker). His remarks made several Western observers, especially privacy advocates, cringe. Its not clear how the Chinese took to his remarks. This came at a time when China is reported to be launching a social credit system.Meanwhile, regulators in the West are tightening the screws on how companies can share their data. The US Federal Communications Commission approved new rules that prevent broadband providers from collecting data about their customers. Article 29 Working Party, the European data protection supervisor, has questioned the recent changes in WhatsApps privacy policy, in which it said it would share data with its parent company Facebook. There is tremendous pressure from civil society as well. For example, Reuters reported that Digital Rights Ireland, a privacy advocate, has challenged an EU-US commercial data transfer pact saying it doesnt have enough privacy protection. While the US has traditionally dealt with the privacy question by strengthening its technology (the Apple-FBI fight is an example), Europe preferred the legal route.Both come with the risk of loopholes, and those in charge of data havent shown much enthusiasm when breaches happen. The disclosure of Yahoo accounts getting hacked came years after it happened. These risks will only go up as the world gets more digital. Recently, researchers from three universitiesthe Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU), the Singapore University of Technology and Design and the University of South Alabamacame together to demonstrate that its possible to hack a 3D printer to make invisible changes to the design. Life is convenient in a digital world, but there are also security and privacy risks. How we balance the two will be one of the biggest challenges in the coming years.There is only one difference between a bad economist and a good one, economist Frederic Bastiat wrote in his famous essay, That Which Is Seen and That Which Is Not Seen: The bad economist confines himself to the visible effect; the good economist takes into account both the effect that can be seen and those effects that must be foreseen. He might have added to that list, the back-end. Its definitely true of cryptocurrencies. A lot of attention has gone towards bitcoins, the rise and fall in the price of the currency, and trying to figure out who created it. Meanwhile, whats turning out to be disruptive is its back-end, blockchain, the automated open public ledger. Its finding new applications, and helping in removing inefficiencies.Cross-border trade is one example. It involves multiple time zones, and multiple payment processing, resulting in delays. Recently, two banks, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Wells Fargo, processed a cross-border trade of cotton from the US to China for an Australian trader using blockchain technology. Mortgage is another. Bank of China and HSBC recently announced that they will use it to speed up home loan processing in Hong Kong.Its not restricted to the finance sector. Disney recently revealed that it was working on its own blockchain called Dragonchain. Its not clear how the entertainment major will use it, even though blockchain fans have been speculating on applications ranging from a new currency that visitors will spend in its theme parks to a points system for different games.

0.33,"Insolvency is not a bad word and is merely an outcome of business operations. In fact, it is the absence of such exit opportunities that lead to a drain of national resources. That was the message from M.S. Sahoo, chairman of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI), at the Mint conference on Bankruptcy ActImpact of the new law on the banking landscape, on 24 October.
				   
				Speaking at the conference Sahoo said the new insolvency and bankruptcy regulation is aimed at creating fear in the minds of promoters so that they do not default. The regulation would ensure that potential defaults are reduced and resources are better managed. The objective of the new rules is that resources be put to use. That there are no defaults, no insolvency. And, it will keep the cost of funds down. This will ensure that many more projects get done, said Sahoo.The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code was enacted earlier this year, paving the way for India to have a bankruptcy law that will ensure time-bound settlement of insolvencies, and enable faster turnaround of businesses, besides creating a database of serial defaulters.The new code replaces existing bankruptcy laws and covers individuals, companies, limited liability partnerships and partnership firms. It will lead to amendments to laws including the Companies Act to become the overarching legislation to deal with corporate insolvency. It will also help creditors recover loans faster.The law on bankruptcy, for instance, envisages creating a complementary ecosystem, including insolvency professionals, information utilities and a bankruptcy regulator. It will enable smoother, time-bound settlement of insolvencies and faster turnaround of businesses and also create a database of serial defaulters.As the new bankruptcy regulator, Sahoo believes that his new role is quite different from his previous assignments at Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and Competition Commission of India (CCI). An insolvency professional is unique. I dont see any other professional taking this much responsibility. If the biggest company has to be liquidated, insolvency professionals will replace the board of the company, he said.According to Sahoo, the unique nature of the work involved makes it challenging as well. He therefore puts a lot of emphasis on the need to ensure quality of insolvency professionals. He also emphasises the need to put in place the right incentive structure and stringent penalties for these professionals. He cautions that these professionals need to avoid any conflict of interest as they will be paid by the company which has hired them.The other challenge will be expanding the capacity of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) which will handle insolvency resolution for companies instead of the current Debt Resolution Tribunal (DRT). There are 70,000 matters pending before the DRT. If the law comes into force by 1 December, assuming one fourth of these cases will move to NCLT, 15,000 will move to the tribunal on Day 1. Whether NCLT has that kind of capacity is the question, added Sahoo.But the regulator is unfazed: he believes these challenges are not insurmountable and that his fifth stint with a regulatory body will be as fruitful and successful as his previous ones.",2016-11-02,eiNJYwgoHevhzBh8bFokLL,"The regulation would ensure that potential defaults are reduced and resources are better managed, says Sahoo",00:40,Bankruptcy code aimed at creating fear in promoters minds: M.S.

0.22,"The first repercussions of the impending departure of Raghuram Rajan from the Reserve Bank of India could now be visibleand it looks like those who argued the independence of Indias central bank was under threat may have been right.
				   
				Indias aspirations
Rajan declared last month that he would not be seeking the expected extension of his terma move widely seen as being forced on him by the Narendra Modi-led government in New Delhi, which had publicly disagreed with several of his decisions and statements as governor. This was troubling. The government appeared to be uncomfortable with its inability, under Rajan, to direct the central banks actions. The implications for the RBIs institutional stability and strengthand for the credibility of India as an investment destinationwerent good.Some of Rajans latest speeches suggest the government is close to knocking a further hole in the RBIs authority. The governor has spoken out against a suggestion, which is gathering force in New Delhi, to use surplus funds with the RBIits contingent reserve, set aside for emergenciesto recapitalize stressed state-owned banks.The governments motivations are understandable. It has committed itself to a pretty stringent path of fiscal consolidation over the next few years, one that would bring the fiscal deficit down to 3% of gross domestic product. However it has to do this at the same time as Indian banksin particular, the state-controlled banks that comprise 70% of the sectorare dealing with a full-blown bad loans crisis. Estimates of bad loans vary widely, but may total anywhere between six and 12% of GDP. The RBI itself estimates they may hit 8.5% of GDP by next March.Recapitalizing the banks is urgentthey need about $140 billion in capital by 2019, according to Fitch Ratingsbut the government has set aside very little money to do so as yet. And soon after the next federal budget is presented at the end of February 2017, Modis government will probably go into election mode. Polls are due in 2017 in the crucial northern state of Uttar Pradesh, and the next general elections will be just two years away at that point. Its obviously tempting to use the RBIs funds instead of finding money from the general budget.Such a move would reverse years of institutional evolution at the central bank. The RBI used to own significant stakes in some major Indian banksa conflict of interest for the central bank, which regulates the banking sector. Even though a government-appointed committee recommended as early as 1998 that these shares be sold, it wasnt till 2010 that the sale actually took place. Rajans fear is that the current administration wants to reverse this processand hes right, doing so would be disastrous.Other bad ideas for plundering the RBIs reserves have been floated before. In 2004, some ministers wanted to tap $5 billion a year from the surplus fund to finance Indias infrastructure-building program. Fortunately, the RBIwith some timely help from the International Monetary Fundmanaged to hold off the government, greatly enhancing its reputation for independence. (Its worth noting that in this, it did better than the US Federal Reserve, which wasnt able to stave off a law passed by the US Congress last December that dipped into its surplus to pay for US highways.)An attempt to use the RBIs rainy-day cash pile would not just dent the central banks independence, but also the credibility of Indias already shaky fiscal arithmetic. It would make accounting for the exact amount that the government was spending impossible, as well as have unpredictable effects on inflation. It would thus vastly set back the RBIs efforts under Rajan to establish a reputation as an inflation-fighting central bank.Worryingly, the governments apparent willingness to compromise RBI independence seems in keeping with several of its recent decisions. The controversial departure of Rajan is one such. The purpose was presumably to replace him with a choice with whom the government is more comfortable, perhaps its chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian, who first suggested dipping into RBI funds in his annual economic survey earlier this year.The fact that the government has chosen to ignore the obvious means of recapitalizing banks is also revealing. The state-owned banking sector shouldnt be bailed out using RBI funds, of coursebut not by using tax money either. Instead, it should be guided towards privatization, and funds for recapitalizing the best banks should be raised from the markets. But movement on this is slow. Modi himself doesnt seem too sympathetic to privatization.Indias prime minister came into office promising maximum governance, minimum government. Thats what both the RBI and the banking sector need, not renewed state control.

				The move assumes significance as the government post demonetisation has been encouraging people to shift to a cash-less or less-cash regime and use digital mode for transactions. HDFC Bank has decided to steeply raise the charges on certain transactions, capping cash component in others and also introducing charges on certain transactions from 1 March, a bank official told PTI on Friday.ALSO READ: RBI to soon put new Rs100 notes in circulationThe city-headquartered bank has capped the third-party transactions at Rs25,000 a day, reduced the number of free cash transactions at branches to four from five earlier and also raised the fee for non-free transactions by a steep 50% to Rs150, it said on its website. Earlier, it used to allow Rs50,000 cash transactions, both withdrawals and deposits per day, the official said, adding the review is only for salary and savings accounts. The bank has also capped the free cash transactions at home branches, including deposits and withdrawals at branches at Rs2 lakh, above which customers will have to pay a minimum of Rs150 or Rs5 per thousand. For non-home branches, the free transactions are only Rs25,000 after which fees set in at the same level, he said. It can be noted that a slower-than-expected fee income growth was one of the reasons which led the bank report its slowest quarterly profit growth in the past 18 years in the just concluded December quarter, when its bottomline growth slipped to 15%, as a slew of charges were discontinued during the note ban. The bank official said the review has been done to discourage usage of cash and push digital transactions, which have grown at a higher pace. The official claimed that the hiked charges are at par with the industry trend. Its larger peer ICICI Banks website shows a minimum charge of Rs150 for more than four cash transactions (deposits and withdrawals) at home branches for savings accounts, similar to what HDFC Bank is proposing. Axis Bank, the third largest private lender, charges Rs150 or Rs5 per thousand, for cash deposits of over Rs1 lakh per month or from the fifth withdrawal at branches, its website said.

Following her resignation, the board of NSE appointed Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd chairman Anand Mahindra, former Reserve Bank of India deputy governor Usha Thorat, founder of Dhruva Advisors Llp Dinesh Kanabar and former Infosys Ltd director Mohandas Pai to choose Ramkrishnas successor.J. Ravichandran, who used to serve as group president of finance and legal and company secretary at NSE, was named the interim MD and CEO.

A text message sent to Limaye was not answered.Limaye, who will be the first NSE CEO from outside the founding team that set up the exchange in the 1990s, will have his hands full at the helm.The stock exchange has filed a draft prospectus with the regulator for an initial public offering after a long battle with existing shareholders who had wanted the bourse to list earlier.Secondly, Sebi is currently examining allegations against NSE that it gave preferential and unfair access to some brokers on its algorithmic trading platform. Sebi is also studying a forensic audit report on this issue prepared by Deloitte India.In January, Limaye was named to a four-member committee formed by the Supreme Court to manage the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). The move was part of the courts efforts to reform the administration of cricket.  Limaye will have to consider whether his commitments at BCCI do not pose a distraction to his work at NSE, said J.N.

0.3,"Tata Steel Ltds planned exit from the UK has moved from clarity to confusion. In end-March, it said it wanted to exit the UK steel business, due to a weakened long-term competitive position. A proposed restructuring would need sizeable capital, involve large risks and may still not deliver. Tata Steel investors were no doubt happy at the decision to axe the UK operations. Also, the urgency on display made it seem like a decision was possible in weeks and not months.
				   
				Instead of announcing a buyer, last weekend, Tata Steel put the sale on the back burner. It now intends to bundle the entire European business, including UK, into a joint venture (JV), perhaps with someone like ThyssenKrupp AG. It cited Brexit and discussions with the UK government on pension liabilities as reasons for the review.ThyssenKrupps interest in a European JV with Tata Steel was known, although it did not include the UK. On the brighter side, steel prices too have recovered since end-March, and the UK business may even be profitable now.Tata Steels Indian investors are sure to fret at this development. Already, its share closed last week lower by about 4% over Mondays close, as rumours of a deferral spread. The actual announcement came post-market hours on Friday. Why the disappointment? Firstly, theres no firm alternative. A revised deal would have closed the chapter.Secondly, Brexit is unfortunate for British businesses. But rising steel prices were beneficial for Tata Steel, as was the governments willingness to give concessions to a new owner. Negotiations could have still progressed. In fact, Liberty House Group, a bidder, was disappointed at Tata Steels decision, according to a Mint report
.This decision can be risky too. Steel prices could fall or the UK government may get cold feet or the pound could recover. Brexits contours may take a long time to show up and a deal held hostage to it can face a long delay. Also, Tata Steels belief about the UK operations structural weakness could not have changed so soon.In the near term, this development will disappoint investors. The June quarter results may offer some solace, as higher prices could see profitability improve, especially in Europe. Steel prices and Chinas stance on steel production will be key global factors to watch out for. An early closure to the European saga would definitely help.

-0.84,"New Delhi/Mumbai: Desperate to develop its own mineral deposits, resource-hungry India is trying to revive investment by taking aim at illegal miners like the sand mafiafrom a few hundred feet in the air.
				   
				The government will deploy flying camera drones to track renegades who for years have been extracting everything from sand to coal to iron ore without permits. Unsanctioned diggers pay no tax, violate the mineral rights of others and employ rudimentary methods blamed for widespread environmental damage. Theyre also hard to catch, working in remote areas and sometimes getting help from corrupt officials.What happens in most of the cases is that when we reach those areas, people get a whiff of it and they run away, they remove their workers, they remove everything, said Piyush Sharma, technical secretary at Indian bureau of mines in Nagpur. Drones will be effective in a way that we will have pictures, which can be used as evidence.Rogue miners have gotten so bad that the government in 2012 shut down all iron ore pits in a western state that was the source of half Indias exports of the mineral. A judicial panel estimated illegal operators in Goa had siphoned off Rs34,940 crore ($5 billion) of ore while dumping toxic waste in rivers and farmland and destroying forest habitat. The ban turned the country from the worlds third-largest exporter of iron ore to a net importer.One of the biggest mineral thefts is sand dredged from ocean beaches and river beds. Unlicensed extraction has caused flooding and threatened marine life like the endangered Gangetic dolphin. But demand for it as a building material in cement and concrete has soared with the expanding economy. In the year that starts 1 April, the government plans to spend $59 billion to modernize railways, airports and roads. It also plans to build 10 million homes for the poor by 2019 and provide electricity to about 240 million people who dont have it.Bureaucratic barriersSand thieves arent the only problem. As growth in Asias second-largest economy fueled a surge in demand for imported raw materials, theres been a lack of investment in domestic mineral reserves. Excessive delays in getting permits led foreign companies like Rio Tinto Group and South Koreas Posco to withdraw huge projects in frustration, and Bangalore-based Deccan Gold Mines Ltd. hasnt mined a single ounce of the metal after 13 years of trying.Using unmanned aerial surveillance of mines can help restore confidence in the governments ability to protect mineral rights and control activity, according to Balvider Kumar, Indias secretary of mines. In addition to tracking the illegal miners and their trucks, the government will have another tool in helping to monitor authorized operations, determine lease boundaries and aid in exploration.In some of the states, illegal mining is a matter of concern as it is taking place on a very massive scale, Kumar said by telephone from New Delhi. Drones can help us find out how much material has been mined by a company and whether correct royalties or taxes have been paid to the government.Thats a big improvement to the current system for monitoring mines and tracking cheats that relies on local complaints and unconfirmed reports, with few ways for the government to follow up to see if action was taken, according to the ministry. The government also began a mining surveillance program in October that employs satellite and remote-sensing technology to help curb illegal activities, according to the Indian Bureau of Mines.Flying eyesEarlier this month, Tata Steel Ltd.s Noamundi iron ore mine became the first in the country to use drone technology on an area spread over 1,160 hectares (2,866 acres) in the state of Jharkhand.State-run exploration agencies and the Indian Institute of Technology are studying drone use over river beds to identify potential trouble spots. Companies also can use thermal cameras in the drones to monitor mines at night, and the technology can provide images that make it easier to map exploration areas that might otherwise take months to complete on foot.The surveillance upgrade is just part of Indias bid to encourage more mineral investment. In 2015,  Prime Minister Narendra Modi decided to switch to competitive auctions for allocating resource rights, after years of discretionary or free allotments led to bruising corruption scandals. While most companies dont like having to re-bid on deposits they find, the government says it wants a more transparent model. The process for getting licences also was simplified.Luring investmentThose are the kinds of changes that Piyush Goyal, who helped to revive the countrys coal production, expects will lure more legal investments in domestic mineral extraction. Goyal, who is the minister of state with independent charge of power, coal, new and renewable energy and mines, predicts spending will surge more than sevenfold to 1 trillion rupees over five years, doubling mine output and reducing dependence on foreign raw materials.India imports almost all of the copper concentrate it uses and is one of the worlds biggest buyers of steel, aluminum, iron ore, gold and coal, mines ministry data show. But the country has yet to fully tap mineral riches that the government estimates are on par with those of major exporters like Canada, Australia, Brazil, South Africa, Chile and Mexico, according to the Central Statistical Organization.Many of those countries are already using drone technology, as are other industries. Indonesia used them at tin mines and to track production at oil-palm and rubber plantations. China employs drones to monitor pollution, while some farmers use them to spread herbicides and photograph plants, according to the digital association Bitkom.Drones are being recognized as the technology of the future, said Sharma, the technical secretary at the Indian bureau of mines.Bloomberg",2017-02-02,fy5nTXrGWaQIIshcdz8jvL,The government will deploy flying camera drones to track renegades who for years have been extracting everything from sand to coal to iron ore without permits,15:15,Catching illegal sand men is key to make mining pay off in India

0.01,"Singapore: Whats a nice round figure to take to a job interview? If the position in question is chairman of Tata group, there might be three of them: $40 billion; 2020; and 250 basis points.
				   
				Thats the value of the Indian conglomerates outstanding debt, and there are several reasons it needs to be discussed before pay and perks.For one thing, investors will hound the next chief for answers. About 90% of the Tata loans and bonds are on the books of publicly listed companies whose shareholders are nervous about the recent sacking of the groups chairman after less than four years at the helm.Market value of Tata groupCyrus Mistry has lashed out against his dismissal by warning of a possible $18 billion in asset writedowns. Discount that estimate for wounded pride, but theres no denying that some of the businesses Mistry described as legacy hot spots do have lousy credit metrics. Tata Teleservices Maharashtra Ltd.s debt exceeds 11 years of the wireless carriers earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Ditto for Tata Steel Ltd. The debt-to-Ebitda multiple at Indian Hotels Co., owner of the Taj group, is approaching eight times.Then theres the niggling issue of bunched-up repayments, the second topic toward which the aspiring chairman must steer the interview. Given that 30% of the Tata group debt originally contracted in US dollars, and more than 60% of the British-pound borrowings, will need to be repaid or refinanced in 2020, the next chairman must know from his recruiters what it is that they wish to tell international creditors about strategy before then.Much of the groups debt burden has its genesis in the optimistic expansion in the second of the two decades under Ratan Tata. To the extent his return (albeit as an interim arrangement) has ignited concerns that Mistrys attempts at deleveraging will get shelved, the new full-time boss will be expected to calm nerves. Otherwise, the loans market, which is currently treating even highly leveraged Tata companies with benign neglect, could turn anxious, especially if the ongoing war of words with Mistry casts a lingering shadow on creditor sentiment. A good place to start that uncomfortable conversation may be 250 basis points, which is the spread the group paid over Libor to raise five-year money this year for Tata Steel. For a company thats rated BB- by S&P Global Ratings, the global average for similar dollar loans this year has been 262 basis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Clearly, the 148-year-old Tata brand commands a decent premium in credit markets despite the dead weight of its European steel operations.That privilege could vanish if the bickering doesnt end. The 78-year-old Ratan Tata may have regained control of the conglomerate that bears his familys name, but Mistrys 18.4% stake in the holding company  and board seats across the group  give the 48-year-old a bully pulpit from which he can demand fire sales, especially of assets his older foe is fond of.A confrontation could get messy for the next chairman. Taking three crucial numbers into the interview wont guarantee success in what might prove to be India Inc.s most demanding open job, but making an appearance without them could be a surefire way to end up as collateral damage.

-0.01,"Bengaluru: Tata Group chairman Cyrus Mistry has a new worry in the growing pile of troubles afflicting Indias largest conglomerate. How to revive growth at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), which accounts for 16% of the groups $103.5 billion revenue?
				   
				The troubles at Tata Motors Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd are well-documented. Despite TCS reporting a 3.7% sequential dollar revenue growth in the April-June period, the company is likely to report weak numbers in the second quarter, results of which will be declared on 13 October.Worryingly for investors, TCS now risks growing at a slower clip this year than last year, when its revenue expanded 7.1%, the slowest annual growth at TCS since 2009, when Natarajan Chandrasekaran took charge as its chief executive. TCS is expected to report an at-best 1.6% sequential dollar growth in the second quarter, according to brokerage BNP Paribas. This, on the back of 3.7% growth in the first quarter, translates into TCS doing $8.79 billion business in the first six months of the current financial year. TCS now needs more than $8.92 billion in revenue in second half of the year if it intends to grow at 7.1% this year. Simply put, TCS will need to record a better show in the October-March period this year than in the second half of last year. This certainly is a tall task as technology outsourcing firms report soft growth in the second half of the financial year.Undoubtedly, Chandrasekaran faces a tough task given the size of TCS.At the heart of TCSs slow growth is its inability to build a stronger consulting practice and reluctance to buy small firms for technologies like design consulting and automation platform providers. These tiny buyouts not just improve the current solution deliveries but also bring in growth. May be now, Mistry could nudge Chandrasekaran to start buying.With this as a backdrop, Mint puts the spotlight on five things to watch in TCSs second quarter earnings on 13 October:1. Revenue growthBrokerage BNP Paribas expects TCSs dollar revenue to rise 1.6% to $4.43 billion in the July-September period on a sequential basis. This is a big worry as this will mean that TCS needs to put forward its best foot forward in the remaining six months of the year if it wants to save itself from the humiliation of recording an even slower growth than last year. Management commentary on demand levels from its customers in Europe, after Britain voted to leave the EU, will be crucial.2. Pressure on profitability poses a double whammySince January this year, TCSs operating margins have been under pressure. TCSs 26.1% Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin at the end of March quarter was 54 basis points less than margins at the end of October-December period last year. The companys margins further contracted to 25.1% at the end of March quarter, which the management claimed to be largely on account of annual wage hikes. Now, as commoditized deals come under further pricing pressure, and TCS continues to spend money in reskilling its workforce and building digital technologies, traditional levers like going slow on hiring, will not be enough to offset the gradual decline in profitability. Analysts say that TCS is unlikely to end the current financial year with its stated guidance of 26-28%.3. What really is the problem among TCSs BFSI clients in the US?On 7 September, TCS in a mid-quarter update, said that some holding back of discretionary spending particularly in the BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance clients) vertical in the United States had led to sequential loss of momentum at the company. Is this just an one-off development or does this suggest a structural malaise? We know all IT vendors are seeing less business from big banks as these banks are spending less in application development work. Homegrown technology vendors are further seeing erosion in current revenue from the embrace of automation platforms, which is cannibalizing the existing model of billing clients on human hours. 4. Rain check of weak sectors and geographiesTCS does not expect growth to rebound in Japan. The company claims to have arrested any loss of business from its UK-based insurance platform Diligenta. Growth from telecoms segment continue to be wobbly. Together, an underperformance from the three units eroded about 2% growth from the companys 11.9% growth on constant currency basis in 2015-16. TCS needs to report some growth on a consistent basis if it has to better last years growth.5. Is higher net erosion of existing business biting into TCSs growth?During the July-September period last year, TCS claimed its order book was the strongest ever, with about 30% more than the company ever managed in any quarter. The company, however, does not disclose its order book size. Outsourcing deals are long-term contracts, and IT vendors can generate only about 3-4% of revenue from new orders in the first year, according to JPMorgan Chases George. Agreed, IT firms lose about 3-5% of current business every year, which in TCSs case, translates into a loss of about $500-825 million a year. This clearly suggest that TCS is losing more business from existing clients because even some business generated from its record order book has not offset the annual loss of business, thereby resulting in a sluggish y-o-y growth.",2016-10-12,hesaBaeP0eIEHrwSnqJO5K,TC is likely to report weak numbers in the second quarter and risks growing at a slower clip this year than last year,01:16,TCS Q2 earnings: Five things to watch for today
0.74,"New Delhi: The practice of forcing industries to cross-subsidize household consumers power tariffs is leading to an unprecedented shift among businesses towards captive solar power with some committing to go fully reliant on clean energy.
				   
				Cost of producing solar power, which was over Rs12 per kilowatt hour (unit) in 2010, has dropped sharply over the years. The latest auction, which was held in November, saw takers for solar power projects willing to sell power at Rs3 a unit. The fall in solar power generation cost has now made it attractive for businesses to go for captive solar power plants, including rooftop plants that supply power cheaper than from the grid, which is expensive on account of the cross-subsidy that industrial consumers are saddled with. Businesses, especially in the manufacturing sector, have long been complaining of high cost of power, exorbitant tax on diesel and escalating cost of capital as factors that render them less competitive in global markets where their peers enjoy low or negative cost of capital and in some cases, subsidies. Solar power is now available at Rs 4-4.5 a unit. In the future, it will cost much less because of technology improvement and possibly low cost of capital. In West Bengal, for instance, cost of power from the grid for industries ranges from Rs 6-8 per unit at present. In Maharashtra, it is Rs 6.5 a unit. Everywhere, except two or three states, tariffs are above Rs 5 a unit for industrial consumers. If you are able to get concessional finance from any multilateral agency and you can produce solar power at Rs 4 a unit consistently for 25 years, it can reduce cost of energy for the business and reduce carbon emissions, said Mahendra Singhi, chief executive officer, Dalmia Cements (Bharat) Ltd. Dalmia Cementss short term goal is to raise the share of clean energy in its total electricity consumption fourfold from 7% at present and to go fully reliant on clean energy in the long term. Multilateral agencies such as International Finance Corp. (IFC), the private investment arm of World Bank Group, US Exim Bank, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Japan International Cooperation Agency and Germanys KFW are bullish on Indias rapidly expanding renewable energy industry for investment opportunities. We already have $1 billion of investments in clean energy projects in India. We are open to scaling it up to $3-4 billion in coming years, said Shalabh Tandon, India lead, climate business & clean energy, IFC. IFC on Thursday announced an equity investment of $125 million in Hero Future Energies Private Ltd., a clean energy firm, for a minority stake. Tandon said that IFC does not invest in coal-based thermal power because of its commitment to climate change goals. Companies like Apple Inc., IKEA Group, Nokia Oyj, Infosys Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd are among those committed to becoming fully reliant on clean energy.The Economic Survey 2015-16 had suggested that the burden of subsidising poor consumers can shift from industrial consumers to rich individuals and that state electricity regulators should use income as a yardstick to fix the power tariff for individual consumers. The idea was to help businesses become more competitive. India has a target of putting in place 175 gigawatt (GW) of renewable power capacity by 2022, out of which 100 GW is to come from solar. At the moment, the country has about 8.7 GW of solar power capacity.One hurdle that companies face in going fully reliant on clean energy is that storage of energy is a costly proposition, which makes them rely on stable power from the grid for a significant part of their energy consumption when renewable energy is not available. Singhi of Dalmia Cements said that once power storage becomes a viable option, the company will be fully run on clean energy.",2017-01-06,hjuezPVDJdbEbipsCKavSN,The fall in solar power generation cost has now made it attractive for businesses to go for captive solar power plants,14:37,Cross-subsidy of power tariffs lure businesses to solar energy

The diversified auto manufacturer, facing growth challenges in both farm equipment and auto segments, managed to sustain profitability on the back of decent sales growth. The stock therefore rose 5% on Monday but slipped a bit on Tuesday, even as it has outperformed the BSE Auto index in the last one year.
				   
				Fuelling growth were the nine new launches in the auto segment through fiscal year 2016 that pushed up sales by about 15% from a year ago. And the price hike helped to improve the average per vehicle revenue by about 4%. However, it was not so in the farm equipment segment, where volumes grew by only 5% year-on-year and the revenue per unit sold fell by 1.7%.True, a weak rabi crop after two consecutive weak monsoons has dried up demand for farm equipment. Yet, as the market leader in tractors, M&Ms market share rose by about 300 basis points to 43% during the quarter. Its small commercial vehicles did not do too well. A basis point is 0.01%.Put together, net revenue (M&M and Mahindra Vehicle Manufacturers Ltd) rose by 15%. But what enthused investors was the 250 basis points jump in operating margin, at a time when sales growth is not at its best. Analysts feel that one-offs impacted profitability. An Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd report says that provisioning in line with the new Bonus Act, value diminution of assets and revaluation of loans impacted profit margins for the quarter. Of course, the biggest relief was the lower raw material costs and efforts to trim vehicle inventory. But this is no reason for bullishness on the companys prospects. The forthcoming monsoon is critical in determining offtake of farm equipment and automobiles. M&Ms management has pulled down its guidance for the former in FY16 from 5% to 10% and this segment comprises a third of the consolidated revenue.That said, the year after may see a better growth rate given the low base, and support an expansion in valuation.

				Manpower shortage and high agricultural wages are driving demand for herbicides. Historically, the availability of an abundance of low-cost workers meant there wasnt much of a need for herbicides, as the work of uprooting the unwanted plants could be done manually. But as wages rose, manual weeding has become an expensive affair, which in turn is driving demand for herbicides.According to Avendus Capital Pvt. Ltd, in the five years to 2014, the herbicides market expanded at an average annual pace of 15%, faster than the 10-13% growth registered by insecticides and fungicides. Insecticides are used to kill insects, while fungicides destroy fungi. The total agrochemical market is estimated to grow by 12% per annum.Avendus Capital forecasts the insecticides and fungicides market growth to moderate to 10-12% in 2014-2019. But herbicides are expected to maintain the growth tempo. From $900 million in 2014 the herbicides market is estimated to double to $1.8 billion in 2019. This trend is expected to continue going forward, with strengthening demand arising for herbicides from increased mechanization and reduced labour intensity of agricultural practices, higher labour cost arising from urbanization and reduction in rural population, Avendus Capital said in a note.Not surprisingly, companies are realigning their product portfolios to capture the strong growth in herbicides. Five of the 20 new products Bayer CropScience Ltd is planning to launch by 2020 are in the herbicides category. The company aims to increase the contribution of revenue from herbicides from 17% now to 40% by 2020, Edelweiss Securities Ltd said in a note.According to B&K Securities India Pvt. Ltd, Rallis India Ltd has launched two new herbicides in the first half of the current fiscal year. The company is expected to ramp up these products in the coming season. Similarly, Dhanuka Agritech Ltd launched three herbicides in the last two years. The product for sugarcane received good response and the company expects sales to pick up in the coming year.India is catching up with the global trends in agrochemical usage. World over, herbicides constitute around 45% of the agrochemicals market, compared with 16% in India, points out Avendus Capital.But due to the reasons cited earlier, and an increased focus on horticulture crops, the market for herbicides is growing at a strong pace. While this should please industry participants, other factors like agricultural produce prices and farm profitability will also have a bearing on demand.",2016-03-24,hyZ3QuNGzpSgPo5BXoqeIO,"Manpower shortage and high agricultural wages are driving demand for herbicides

-0.19,"Mumbai: As India wakes up on Friday and lines up outside automated teller machines (ATMs) to refill its wallets with the much coveted Rs100 currency notes, it is important to note the work that went behind making this happen.
				   
				On Wednesday afternoon, nearly 20 hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the government had decided to scrap Rs500 and Rs,000 currency notes in a bid to fight black money and terrorism funding, senior officials from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the National Payments Council of India (NPCI) met with members of the ATM and cash logistics industry to discuss a strategy to ensure cash replenishment happens across the country and the machines dont end up dispensing old high denomination notes.The central bank officials were fresh out of a meeting with bank chiefs who had promised them that the situation at branches when banks reopened on Thursday would be taken care of. However, managing ATMs wasnt in their hands.The pressure, as members of that meeting figured, would be on the cash logistics industry which was responsible for transporting cash between the treasury and bank branches, between the banks and the ATMs and between banks and the large outlets that needed currency notes. It was decided that they would get time until Thursday to ensure that enough currency notes reached different parts of the country.The RBI had asked us to focus on three major duties in a specific order. The first was to ensure that enough Rs100 currency notes were being filled at ATMs across India. The second task was to ensure that the old high denomination notes were brought back to bank branches, so that they could be removed from circulation. The last duty was to push the new Rs500 and Rs2,000 currency notes, said Anush Raghavan, vice-president operations, of SIPL, a CMS subsidiary which is Indias largest payment and cash management solutions company and the worlds fourth largest ATM cash management company. Raghavan was present at the meeting.To make this happen, it was essential that the switches of all ATMs were reconfigured so that they dispensed only Rs100 currency notes, even if they had Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes filled in them.The RBIs focus was on moving Rs100 notes because removing Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes would take roughly a week and it would be counterproductive to make that the primary job, Raghavan said.To fully appreciate these tasks, one must note that the cash logistics industrywith its nearly 9,000 cash vans and 30,000 employeestouches about 25,000 ATMs in a day. As of now, India has 2.2 lakh ATMs and the time given to these companies was less than 48 hours.Another big challenge in this is to ensure that cash movement in high crime zones happens only during the day, since the police typically stops this movement at night in these places.To achieve this, the Cash Logistics Association of India (CLAI), which is the industry body for these companies, had set up a control room to monitor all of these vehicles and receive hourly updates on the movement of cash, according to Rituraj Sinha, president, CLAI.We cancelled all the leaves of our employees during this period and have been working 24x7 to ensure that cash movement happens across locations. By Thursday evening, about 75% of the work was near completion. We expect that by midnight, it would be fully complete, said Sinha.The companies also decided that they would not hold the banks at ransom by demanding any additional charges due to the high frequency of cash movement.However, it would not be possible for the industry to ensure that the machines are fully stocked through the day.The cash holding capacity of these machines would be limited since they would have only Rs100 notes and the machines can hold only up to 8,000-10,000 currency notes. The number of notes is usually dependent on the average traffic that the machines see every day. However, the industry is expecting larger crowds across all machines on Friday.",2016-11-11,i3mN2SSpKfxTA0Gk0O0BvL,India has 2.2 lakh ATMs and the time given to the cash logistics companies was less than 48 hours,09:47,How the ATM industry is struggling to cope with the currency note swap

				The impending entry of a new fourth-generation operator would anyway mean a trip to the slaughterhouse for a few of the dozen existing players, some of whom are already making a run for the coop door. But thats a known risk. Its the threat of having to cede market share to billionaire Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Jio faster than imagined thats causing nervousness.That latter possibility has been raised by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of Indias (Trai) consultation paper on scrapping the compensation one wireless service receives for calls routed to it by another.That proposal to do away with the calling-party-pays system, the incumbents allege, smacks of bias. It would give a pricing advantage to a new network like Jio, which would be more likely to originate calls than terminate them. Meanwhile, Jio has complained that existing operators are sabotaging its ongoing beta trials by not offering adequate interconnection, leading to call drops.Incumbents have denied the allegation, and accused Ambani of running a service in the garb of testing. The dispute is fast turning into just the kind of melee the government, looking to hold its biggest-ever auction of spectrum a little more than a month from now, can ill afford.Also Read: Reliance Jio vs the rest: Trai, PMO dragged into the fightTo the extent the fracas is the harbinger of a bruising price war, its also bad news for shareholders of Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular, which together with Vodafone control more than three-fifths of the market. The quest to expand data usage on their networks ahead of Jios long-delayed entry has already caused prices to head south:While data usage is indeed picking up, capital expenditure is accelerating. Ideas net debt is almost 5.7 times annual earnings before interest and taxes (Ebit); its 3.3 times Ebit for Bharti. With Reliance boasting to the regulator that its $20 billion investment in Jio is already more than any of its competitors, incumbents have little breathing room.When Kumar Mangalam Birla, Idea Cellulars controlling shareholder, sought to streamline his fiber-to-finance empire, minority shareholders balked at the prospect of being asked to fund his money-guzzling telecom venture. Ambani, on the other hand, has been lucky. His petroleum-refining business is minting cash, so creditors are giving him the chips to spin the roulette wheel and grab those 100 million Reliance Jio subscribers he craves.The stakes are high, and so are anxiety levels. With the regulator adding to the uncertainty about future market share, investors can expect more volatility. Idea Cellulars shares jumped as much as 7.9% on Tuesday before the company said media speculation about a sale to Vodafone is untrue and preposterous.The fluttering has begun.

-0.67,"Singapore/Seoul: Lee Jae-yong, the crown prince of the founding family that controls Samsung Group, is getting expanded corporate power. Now comes the guessing game about what hell do with it.
				   
				On Thursday, Lee officially joined a nine-person board at Samsung Electronics Co., whose botched roll out of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone has delivered a blow to a premier tech brand and cost the company billions of dollars in profit. The move gives the low-profile executive, also known as Jay Y., a big say over top management and strategic calls, including restructurings, mergers and asset sales.His ascension comes on the same day that Samsung reported a sharp decline in profits, as the recall took its toll. Net income fell to 4.41 trillion won ($3.9 billion) in the September quarter; the debacle that may ultimately cost more than $6 billion. Shares in the company rose 0.4% at the close of trade in Seoul.Lee, 48, is already vice chairman of Samsung Electronics and has gained influence since his father, Lee Kun-hee, suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized in 2014. The founding family controls Samsung Group, whose tentacles extend into financial services, hotels, biopharmaceuticals and fashion, through a complex network of cross ownership. So in a way, Lees elevation to the board of the flagship will be something akin to a coronation.We can now say that Lees regime has officially begun, said Lee Chaiwon, chief investment officer at Korea Value Asset Management Co. I think a new era is coming. Lee believes Jay Y.s enhanced influence will be an adrenaline shot for a company in crisis. The company will become more market-friendly, he said, predicting the new board member will quicken its restructuring process.Samsung Electronics has no shortage of challenges, urgent ones. In addition to mopping up after the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, the younger Lee faces a threat from activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. thats pushing Samsung Electronics to simplify its ownership structure. The New York-based fund, founded by stock picker Paul Singer, also wants the company to add independent directors and dish out a special $27 billion dividend to investors.Being a board member means management responsibility, said Heo Pil-seok, chief executive officer of Midas International Asset Management Co. The market will expect Lee to come up with some follow-up steps to settle the Note 7 problem.Samsungs management and board are carefully reviewing all of Elliotts proposals, senior vice-president Robert Yi told a conference call. After buying back more than 11 trillion won of stock since last year, the Suwon-based company plans to shed more light on its shareholder return policy next month, he said.While about 400 investors attended the meeting to vote on Jay Y.s appointment, the man himself wasnt there. Instead it was vice chairman Kwon Oh-hyun and co-chief executive officer Shin Jong-kyun who spoke about the crisis and management shortcomings.Shin said the number of incidents with the Note 7 was in the hundreds and Samsung was continuing to investigate as it revisits every aspect of its hardware, software and production processes.It is not acceptable that we did not meet our own quality assurance standards, said Shin, a former head of the phone business. We know we must work hard to earn back your trust and we are committed to doing just that.Then theres the broader sales slump at Samsung Electronics, which also makes semiconductors and display panels. The company is coping with a drop in LCD panel prices and lower-cost Chinese rivals in the television market. Total third-quarter sales fell to 47.8 trillion won and the company could record its third straight year of decelerating annual revenue, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. For the coming year, Samsung said its planning to spend a record 27 trillion won on plants and equipment as it boosts production of OLED displays.What Samsung needs the most now is the total shake-up of its system and personnel in order to refresh its collapsed brand image following the Note 7 crisis, said Chung Sun-sup, CEO of corporate research firm Chaebul.com. He sees Lees influence being felt across the entire Samsung empire, starting with groups annual management shake-up at the end of the year. He will legally play a lead role in the groups key affairs, including making big deals, personnel reshuffle and other financial agendas, he said.Owing to South Koreas tradition of filial piety, its been difficult for the younger Lee to take command since his father fell ill. That said, Lee attracted media attention in 2015 when he apologized on live television for a Samsung-owned hospitals failure to contain a Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome.Franz-Hermann Hirlinger, the first foreign outside director ever to serve at Samsung Electronics, remembers Lee as a young man who always sat in a corner with his back straight and hands neatly folded on his knees, quietly observing board meetings. Everyone in the room, including Hirlinger, knew that it was part of his training to succeed his father one day.That day has arrived. And Lee is already drawing criticism. Sustinvest Inc., a Seoul-based proxy-advisory firm, said in a letter to shareholders this week that Lee isnt qualified to be on the board because he benefited from inter-affiliate transactions at the Samsung group.There is a widespread expectation for vice chairman Lee to show that he is able to take charge and lead Samsung out of the crisis and usher in change, said Kim Sang-jo, a professor at Hansung University.People who have worked closely with Jay Y. describe him as a polar opposite of his larger-than-life father. The younger Lee is an affable, approachable man with a global view, who wants to modernize South Koreas largest business group, according to Hirlinger.In his new and expanded role, Lees performance will come under even greater scrutiny. Until now, Lee could just enjoy the good times and avoid the bad times and didnt have to take any legal responsibilities, said Chung with Chaebul.com. But if things like the Note 7 happens again, he said, many fingers will point at him. Bloomberg",2016-10-27,iCeczLlNyM59tEfmNqRosK,"Lee Jae-yong, 48, is already vice chairman of Samsung Electronics and has gained influence since his father, Lee Kun-hee, suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized in 2014",16:02,Samsung scion Lee Jae-yong begins reign amid Galaxy Note 7 smartphone crisis 
-0.64,"Mumbai:  I woke up early on Thursday morning and got dressed quickly to get out and convert the sole Rs500 currency note in my wallet. Typically, we journalists dont carry a lot of cash in wallets (not that our bank accounts have much either). Banks were opening after a days break and India had seen the largest currency withdrawal programme in nearly 40 years, and a moderate to large crowd was certainly expected. But then it was just one note, how long would it take to exchange? I thought while clearly underestimating the average Indians need to be first in a queue.
				   
				I thought of visiting the closest bank branch I could find in Bandra West. A sole Greater Bombay Cooperative Bank branch gave me some hope. I could see some people waiting for the bank to open so that they may feel rich again. As soon as the branch started its operations, I could see eager customers in the queue look spiffy, only to see the branch staff come out and tell them that they had not received any new currency notes and they did not have a ny new notes. The notes would only arrive after  4pm.  Six hours for a lousy Rs 500 currency note? Whats this, the iPhone 7? I muttered under my breath while angrily kicking the ground.Maybe the branch of a bigger bank might be a good idea, I thought to myself, carefully caressing the Rs500 note in my hand. I walked up to an Axis Bank branch nearby, only to find out that the staff had run out of Rs100 currency notes in the first couple of hours. The staff told all of us to come back by tomorrow to get the new Rs500 and Rs 2,000 currency notes. Maybe a public sector bank will be more amenable to my needs and ensure that I have enough liquidity to last the day before the automated teller machines (ATMs) start working from Friday. I got into an autorickshaw and asked the driver to drop me at a bank branch. Any bank branch would do, I said to myself. An Allahabad Bank branch on Pali Hill Road was the closest we could find. So I walked up to the gate, which was teeming with people at the door. Apparently they wanted my original identity proof and self-attested photocopy to ensure that my money is converted into an acceptable currency over which I shall have ownership rights again. However, I quickly moved to the neighbouring private bank ICICI Bank, thinking the documentation system would be much easier. ICICI Bank, I thought, would have a more streamlined process where the authorities wouldnt want me to give them a hundred different documents. Of course, I forgot that this withdrawal of currency was a government initiative, so every possible box for paperwork has been ticked.Besides, I had lost my old wallet only recently and all of my original government identity proofs were gone though I had the photo copies of them. The Rs500 note in my wallet was staring back at me with disdain, even as I tried to look for a way to get rid of it.The staff at the ICICI Bank branch was considerate enough to come and tell me that there was no rush to come and convert my money to the new currency on Thursday. And, I could come back anytime later in the week. Of course, I didnt tell her about my lost identity proofs, but it felt good that these options were readily available for some more time.

-0.05,"Bengaluru: It has been a little over 15 months since R. Seshasayee became the non-executive chairman of Infosys Ltd. His term coincides with a very interesting time for the company, which is trying to regain its tag as the bellwether of the Indian IT industry under its first non-founder chief executive, Vishal Sikka.
				   
				In an interview, Seshasayee explained his equation with Sikka, the changing role of the board, the challenges it faces, its relationship with the company founders, what he likes about Sikkas leadership style and why it is wrong to say that Infosys has twin power structures. Edited excerpts:Is Infosys in a better shape now than when you started in this role?Firstly, the change at the leadership level, to have someone like Vishal (Sikka) come (in), has (given) a very clear strategic direction to the company, given the changing landscape in the industry. That is a very big step forward.From the boards perspective, it is very important to have the right leader, and I believe we have the right leader. From the boards perspective, it is important that the leader articulates the strategy (and) the board is aligned to this strategy. I can categorically say that the board is fully aligned to this strategy Vishal has sketched.I and the board feel extremely good that this strategic change in direction to meet the new demands in the business landscape has gone down very well. To communicate this kind of a change in an organization that is as large as Infosys is not easy.Now, of course we have the execution challenges. And those are things which we will learn as we go along. We have had a few bumps. We have had some quick learning. I think, by and large, the strategy is getting executed with the right speed and in the right direction. What is the boards role in designing this strategy?Ideally, the board should pick the right leader for the company and the leader should articulate the strategy. The board has an active role to play for sure in understanding the strategic proposal, challenging that, and getting an alignment between the management and the board. The board cannot stand aside and say that all this is strategic direction and not our problem. The board has to be fully engaged in (the) formulation of strategy.We have had in the last couple of years a pretty deep level of engagement. The board does not meet only for board meetings for approving what is put on the table. So the engagement has been continuous. It has not been even that it takes place (just) once a quarter.The second is that I also think that it is important to think for the board to be learning. Learning is an important DNA of Infosys. Learning does not just apply to executives, the rank and file of management. It equally applies to members of the board. We have had systematic immersion sessions. And our intent is to intensify these sessions. Intent is to make sure that we are not merely sitting and listening in these sessions.This is a journey. It is never-ending. But I do think both these continuous engagement and continuous learning are making it possible to have a very constructive dialogue with the leadership. What are the big challenges faced by the board?I cannot think of a company of this size which has gone through transformation simultaneously on three fronts. The first is the business transformation. All IT firms are going through this, simply because (their) clients are going through this transformation. That is one massive transformation. That is pervasive and happening all across.The second is the move from (being) an iconic promoter-led organization to an organization that is professionally managed at the management and board level. I was actually looking at how many top 100 companies in India have entirely professional board and professional management. If you leave aside the banks and the public sector undertakings, perhaps Infosys is the only company. From a governance construct, this is a very unique and desirable construct, one which would be the ideal construct. But this transformation from a promoter-managed organization to a professional-managed organization both happening at the same time, is a huge transformation. Actually the average tenure of the board, if I leave aside Jeff (Professor Jeffrey Lehman), is two-and-a-half years. So you have a completely new set of people.And so, to be able to navigate this huge company in the right direction, from the point of view of both strategic (issues) and governance, that requires a great deal of work, and a great deal of rescripting of the playbook.We have had challenges in the first quarter. We have had some challenges (with) a couple of good leaders, whom we would have liked to retain, not being there. We have had some challenges regarding the perception issue into governance. I dont think these are real issues but perception issues. But we have very quickly learnt and we are putting in very quickly in place the right kind of solutions. That is the second kind of transformation which we are scripting very well.And then there is the third kind of transformation which is the cultural transformation. From a company that had been pretty much India-centric, we are truly now global-minded. This is a cultural shift. So, in some sense, we need to reset the needle. Each of these transformations is itself a challenge. It may not be apparent to someone on the outside. There is some criticism that Infosyss board does not have enough people with a technology background. Im hearing this for the first time that we do not have enough people from tech background on the board. We have Vishal and (chief operating officer) Pravin (Rao).Beyond Vishal and Pravin?Let me explain the diversity we have on the board. We have Ravi (Venkatesan), who has spent years in technology at Microsoft. Of course, we have Roopa (Kudva) and Punita (Kumar-Sinha). Look at their background. They have not been only in one industry. Roopa has spent a lifetime at a variety of industries, evaluating, assessing, rating a variety of industries. And so has Punita. We have people dealing with different firms, including technology firms. Then we have people like Jeff and John (Etchemendy) who bring the academic discipline to it. Kiran (Mazumdar-Shaw) is a very entrepreneurial person. We have a very good diverse group of people. Having said that, we are constantly on the lookout for the right kind of talent. We are pretty much looking at every possible skill where we think we have a gap and which we think we need to bring in. So we are looking at people. So that is a continuous process. We have people on the board who can read the future, have good understanding of technology trends, are able to challenge the strategic direction. We do take external inputs where we need. So those people dont have to be on the board.So could you perhaps expand the board?We are on the lookout, and we have some candidates in mind and we will do it at the right time.Help us understand the boards relationship with the company founders.So this iconic institution has been created by an iconic leader (N.R. Narayana) Murthy and his wonderful team. This is an outstanding or exceptional kind of history where Murthy and team decided to step down or step away. I must tell you categorically that while I have personally a lot of communication happening with Murthy, not once even by accident have the promoters asked for information which is not available to the public. That must be said to the credit of the promoters that they have not sought any information which would give them any preferential access to any information.We talk about many things. We talk about perceptions that you might have from what is available in the public domain, about the kind of strategic direction. And I take his advice very seriously. But that said, the board has the responsibility to do what is right for the institution. The board is closest to the facts and the situation on the ground.And therefore, information and facts, which are available to the board must drive the board in the right direction, and that decision will be of the board only. Do you think the founders could have expressed their unhappiness with certain board decisions such as Sikkas compensation or Kumar-Sinhas appointment differently?This is a question that should not be asked to me, since this is what the promoters chose to do; so it will not be fair for me to respond. From the boards perspective, we have advice coming from many other investors and not just the promoters. If you believe we do not have discussions with any other investors, you are wrong. The conversations we have with the promoters are no different than those we have with other investors. So it is not right for me to be second-guessing on what they should do. Were you a little saddened by the way they expressed their displeasure?This is a free world and everybody has their own viewpoint. So, do I get saddened by the percentage of negative votes on anything? No. I have a job to do, and we have some 99 percentage in favour and that is a resounding endorsement of the boards recommendation. We should just move on. What issues do you seek their advice on? There are many issues on which I seek advice from many people. So why would you want to only look at what Im seeking from Mr Murthy. Murthy has been a friend for 30 years. We have worked together on boards. We were together on the board of ICICI, we have worked together on many other forums. So he is one person I respect, like other people. So I dont see anything unusual in that. There is this perception that there are twin power centres at Infosys: Murthy and Sikka.First, there is no such twin power centres. That is completely wrong, and that will be very unfair to the promoters. Because, like I mentioned, Murthy has been an exceptional leader who has chosen to stay away and only give advice when sought from. So it will be utterly wrong. Now, the second thing is that when you say there is this perception. Now I dont want to deal with perceptions. We must deal with reality. Im dealing with reality. The reality is that what I have clearly said.What are the issues on which Sikka seeks your advice?Because of the fact that we have a very unique construct, the engagement of the board (with Sikka) has been continuous. My engagement with Vishal has been more intense than the rest of the board. I think we speak almost every week, sometimes multiple times a week. We discuss different issues, say related to people, organization, performance, relating to issues on strategy, customers. We discuss also spirituality and philosophy on weekends. We have an excellent rapport and relationship. We have a lot of common interests. Last night, we were talking on pure sciences. So, the foundation of the relationship is one of complete mutual trust, and complete transparent sharing of information and views. So there are many things that we do.How is the board helping Sikka in this transformation? Its a two-way constructive process. Its not on the basis of a paper that is put on the table. The way it is being done is through continuous, comprehensive and concerted engagement.What is the toughest issue you have advised him on so far?The toughest discussions we have had are on philosophy.Is Vishals compensation of $11 million a year linked to Infosys clocking $20 billion by March 2021?The compensation is linked to targets which are publically given. There is a trajectory for this. The compensation is linked to that trajectory. This is something which the board and Vishal have discussed and agreed.Can you help us understand the weightage of the three specific targets (total revenue, revenue per employee, operating margin) on Sikkas variable pay?There is probably no other Indian company which has so clearly linked pay to targets which have been made public. To my mind, this is the most transparent way of getting shareholders approval. In the trajectory, we have to take into account many things. We need to take into account the industry dynamics, the company dynamics, the people dynamics, all of that. Thats something which the board is charged with the responsibility to do and we will do so.Can you give us some details about the trajectory itself?Can you tell me another company that has been giving the targets for the compensation of the chief executive? There is good reason why no other company does this. It is not because this is inconvenient or anything. It is because, as I said, its a very dynamic situation. Every month, we see changes in the landscape. Every month, we see new challenges. The board is a delegated authority of the shareholders to run this company. It is therefore in the fitness of things that the board does the job that has been entrusted by the shareholders. It doesnt kick back to the shareholders the job that has been entrusted. We have gone one step further to say, yes this long-term goal is what we believe must be the reference point for the compensation.So is it more aspirational in nature?No, I have said that there is nothing aspirational in this. This is a target which the company is looking at, is pursuing. Now nothing is cast in stone. But this is, at the moment, the target that we have.Are you saying that the growth of the industry will also be taken into account?The growth of the industry is pretty much the playfield, right? So we have got to look at the growth of the industry in the context of assessment.(For any company,) the target is fixed for the annual budget in the context of what you see is the market situation. Technology changes, all of it are taken into account. A five-year goal is fixed on what you believe is the kind of the trajectory in this. We have to keep constantly calibrating both the environment and the industry. As of now, we are not changing those targets (for Infosys).Can they be changed?Thats a speculative question. Why did the board change its original plan on the promised payment to former chief financial officer Rajiv Bansal?All I can say is I have already made the statement suo motu in the AGM (annual general meeting). You wrote this article (referring to Mints story in May on Bansals unusually high severance pay). Because you wrote this article, I thought it is important and it is our responsibility to make sure that we address this issue. So the issue was not raised in the AGM, but I made a suo motu statement saying that we believe that there is no impropriety.There is a severance agreement. There are rights of the parties in the contract. And the contract will be administrated in line with the rights of the parties. Period. That is all. So has there been any change in the agreement?That is not something you need to be looking at all. I am only saying there is a contract, (there are) the rights of the parties in the contract and the contract will be administered in line with the contractual rights of the parties. Period.So is it fair to assume that you could rework it if one of the parties did not abide by its terms?This is an entirely legal issue. All I need to say is that there are no other extraneous considerations for this, for the administration of this. It will be driven by the contractual rights. Has anything happened within the realms of that contract that could lead to a change in it?No matter where you are coming from, the only two things which are relevant to the public and relevant to everybody else (are): Is this an issue where there is impropriety? I have said no, repeatedly no, and I stand by that.Is this contract getting changed or cancelled for any other extraneous considerations? I am going a step further to say: The contract will be administered based on the rights of the parties in the contract. Period.How do you like Sikkas leadership style?We have the right kind of leader in Vishal. His understanding of the changes, his insight into the changes is outstanding. Vishals articulation of a solution, even in the context of the auto industry for example or the banking industry, is absolutely on the dot. We have a very good leader who understands client requirements and his client connect is exceptional. His strategic direction is exceptional. He has been a phenomenal person to motivate a very, very large crowd. Its not easy for a new person to step in and have this kind of influence. We certainly have an exceptional leader.How has the boards role at a company changed?The role of a board has changed phenomenally, and for the good. It is no longer this friends club that you had in the past and people coming to have a cup of coffee and go back. This is the trusteeship concept. That is getting to be far better understood now by enlightened boards, and therefore, the responsibility that comes with that. In the process, the engagement is getting to be much more. Increasingly, I find that the board meeting is just one punctuation mark in that engagement. It also brings in the need for a greater amount of understanding of the business and the independence to challenge.

				At a panel discussion at the 10th Mint Annual Banking Conclave held in Mumbai on 23 January, bankers came together to discuss the  impact of going cashless on financial inclusion. Cashless transactions and financial inclusion are contradictory. If you are talking of cashless transactions, it will lead to financial exclusion, not lead to financial inclusion. You cannot have cashless financial transactions anywhere in the world and if it happens poor will suffer. Even in developed markets, the poor do financial transactions through cash, said K.C. Chakrabarty, a former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India. Chakrabarty, who had steered the financial inclusion drive at the central bank, says cash is the only payment mode  that ensures 100% penetration at low cost. Rajiv Lall, founder, managing director (MD) and chief executive officer (CEO) of IDFC Bank, however, believes that a technology-enabled payments service could be the answer to mass banking. Citing the example of Paytm, Lall said that payments are becoming an important service and the first point of contact with the customer in order to build a banking relationship. However, he was quick to add that cash still remains the most convenient way of doing transactions.Jiji Mammen, CEO of Mudra Bank, also concurred that cashless economy is the need of the hour. The segment which is at the bottom of the pyramid only deals in cash. Because of that we dont have transactional history of the person. Banks find it difficult to provide loan to persons at the bottom of the pyramid because there is no data available about them. If you go into digital mode, of course it will take time, over a period of time everyone will come on board, he said. But Chandra Shekhar Ghosh, MD and CEO of Bandhan Bank, is of the view that the shift to digital will not happen overnight.  When I started 16 years ago, microcredit to offer loan, that time also it was not readily accepted and I was questioned why the loan is given in a simple way, bank is not giving in a simple way, what is your intention. Now when we are going with new things, they are also asking a lot of questions on that. Down the line, they will understand and this money will be safe in bank accounts. The maximum number of MFI (microfinance) customers are women but their children are open to digital transactions, said Ghosh.At a time when most banks are testing different technologies independently or with the help of fintech companies to lure customers, mobile banking by way of smartphones is emerging as the most preferred mode of transaction. According to Samit Ghosh, MD and CEO of Ujjivan Financial Services Ltd, smartphones are the ultimate end of the cashless journey. For the time being Ghosh says he believes that the presence of bricks-and-mortar branches helps to build the trust among people. We had done a research with our segment of customers, trust is very important in banking. To see a bricks and mortar, even if they dont come there or even if they transact in handheld devices, is very important. Till a certain stage to build that trust, you have to have bricks and mortar, he added. But majority of bankers agree that the proportion of cash will come down in the system, albeit gradually. I expect 30-40% reduction in cash and the cash-to-GDP to fall from  10% to 6-7% by 2020, said V.S. Radhakrishnan, MD and CEO of Janalakshmi Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. Having said that, Radhakrishnan says he believes that smartphone banking is not going to pick up as long as digital costs remains high. Its not digital transactions alone that will drive financial inclusion. According to Jaspal Bindra, executive chairman of Centrum Group, banks still consider financial inclusion as an obligation and not as an objective and there needs to be a change in mindset.",2017-01-30,iVi36s7mEwuLPZ1Q2neqEN,"At a panel discussion at the 10th Mint Annual Banking Conclave in Mumbai, bankers weigh the  impact of going cashless on financial inclusion",02:20,Mint Annual Banking Conclave: Impact of going cashless on financial inclusion

His regular ENT (ear, nose and throat) specialist had gone abroad for a medical conference and he didnt know of any other in his neighbourhood. He surfed the web for help and discovered, to his momentary relief, that he could fix an appointment online with a specialist at one of the hospitals not far from where he lived.
				   
				Hospitals, especially in India, have for long cut a sorry figure in terms of their digital savvy and use of information technology (IT) to be on par with their counterparts in sectors such as banking and telecom.According to Tirupathi Karthik, CEO of Napier Healthcare, a Singapore-based provider of software solutions to the healthcare industry, As compared to a global average of 22.5% of income spent on IT by healthcare providers, or even 6-15% being invested in IT in other sectors within India, anecdotal data from multiple sources indicate that healthcare providers in India rarely spend more than 0.5% of their annual revenue on information technology.  But things have been changing for some time, albeit at a pace slower than many would want. Leading the change are large hospital chains such as Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd, Max Healthcare Institute Ltd and Fortis Healthcare Ltd.Prodded on by the need to take control of their sprawling operationswhich span dozens of hospitals in multiple citieson the one hand, and the rising expectations of tech-empowered consumers on the other, these modern hospitals are setting the template for healthcare in India.High time they did so. If you looked at the hospitals in India around 10 years back, they were very basic in terms of tech infrastructure. Besides, independent doctors got what they pretty much wanted. This led to lack of control with the management and poor visibility into the entire treatment and costs hospitals had to bear, says Varun Gera, founder and chief executive of HealthAssure Pvt. Ltd, a primary  healthcare aggregator that has partnered with almost 2,300 clinics, including diagnostic labs and hospital OPDs (out-patient departments). He says that somewhere along the line hospitals had to work as hospitals and it could no longer be the case of doctors having their own way of doing things. While part of this doctors-management clash had to do with egos, a more significant role was played by ITthe lack of it in the early days and increasing enablement as time went on. It is the clinical protocols, organisation-wide processes and use of IT tools through which hospitals, particularly those with a corporate road map to grow fast, could gain better control, get visibility into how treatment is given, and embrace more standardization for better healthcare outcomes across their chain of facilities.Once processes and IT tools began to be adopted, hospitals moved on from using basic networking and hospital information systems (HIS) to looking at electronic medical records (EMRs) and other advanced deployments for improving efficiency as well as patient care.According to research firm Gartner Inc., Indian healthcare providers are set to spend $1.2 billion on IT products and services in 2016, including telecom services.  Among the key areas in which hospitals are increasingly focusing their IT efforts are online doctor appointments, data capture of patients visiting the hospitals and applying analytics tools to get insights into their operations.One of the large hospital chains investing big time in IT is Apollo. One of the things we have done is enabled online appointment for doctors. Earlier, less than 10% of our patients came by appointment. Now at Apollo almost 50% of patients are coming by appointment, says Sangita Reddy, joint managing director, Apollo Hospitals.That is a huge change in terms of avoiding the chaos resulting from a lot of patients just landing up at its hospitals all over India. It also allows Apollo to focus on the more important task of clinical care rather than manage hordes of patients shuffling from one department to the other on its premises.More significant change is afoot through the use of data analytics for both clinical and non-clinical insights. We are collecting about 55% of all our patients clinical data electronically, which is enabling us to create a digital warehouse. This digital warehouse, in turn, is enabling us to do data mining and use this data in different ways, says Reddy.These efforts are helping Apollo in workflow prediction, staffing, communication, etc., and helping the organization turn into a data-driven enterprise.One of the key areas in which analytics is being applied at Apollo, according to Reddy, is the use of predictive analytics for clinical purposes. We have pioneered the concept of personalized health check-ups in India: instead of a common check-up, it is customized based on analytics of data of almost 1 million patients that have visited our hospitals over the years, she says. The decision tree for providing healthcare is being evolved based on scenario building through matching a particular medicine with a particular disease or condition that previous patients had encountered. The result is quicker treatment with improved outcomes.The analytics tool enhances the effectiveness of the medication that doctors choose, says Reddy.On the question of the acceptance of such tools by the medical fraternity, she says, We use these predictive analytics tools in a recommendatory manner, so its not forced on the doctorsand we have found a very high degree of acceptance. Currently being used in its large hospitals, Apollo will soon extend its use to other hospitals as well.There is a lot of scope for improvement in the way hospitals in India operate and use IT to manage operations and deliver healthcare in a seamless manner taking into account the intricacies involved in settling health insurance claims. According to Gera, The whole focus now is on getting the data out and efficiency of operations. The way hospitals operate currently is much fractured, as there are multiple complexities involved in their operations.And while technology cannot do everything for hospitals, the right tools and processes can make a big difference to the quality and speed of healthcare delivery in India.Among the tools for improving or aiding clinical outcomes, International Business Machines Corp.s Watson cognitive computing solutions for healthcare are being considered by many hospitals in India. One of the first to implement it is Manipal Hospital Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. According to IBM, Watson for Oncology is now in use by oncologists at six locations in the Manipal Hospitals network to provide information and insights to physicians to help them identify personalised, evidence-based cancer care options across India.If the past decade signified the modernisation of hospitals in terms of physical infrastructure, medical equipment and the like, the next one is likely to be defined by integration of multiple IT tools, advanced analytics solutions, health monitoring devices and Internet of Thingsunder which medical devices, computer systems, smartphones and diagnostic equipment will share data with each other in real time for individualised, improved healthcare.",2016-11-04,iX1AMyGsjOevaUwtoZVn4N,"Hospitals have for long cut a sorry figure in terms of digital savvy and the use of information technology.

0.54,"Bangalore/Mumbai: Amid the carnage on Wall Street in 2008, as Bank of America Corp. was trying to forge its rushed merger with Merrill Lynch & Co., Natarajan Chandrasekaran boarded a plane for New York to try to reassure the two financial behemoths that an Indian IT company could make the systems of their strikingly different cultures work together.
				   
				Chandrasekaran, known as Chandra, was then chief operating officer of Asias largest IT services exporter, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS). Over the following weeks he fended off global rivals who smelled an opportunity to muscle in, and set about integrating the banks systems and assuaging the new managements anxieties about outsourcing to a foreign supplier. TCS kept the business and grew it substantially.Last week, Chandra, now chief executive officer of TCS, was chosen for an even more fraught diplomatic task: to resurrect the image and fortunes of the Tata Group, Indias biggest conglomerate, which has been racked by losses at some of its biggest units, and by a boardroom battle that has threatened to turn the workings of the venerable corporation into a media soap-opera.Tata Sons, the group holding company, named Chandra, 53, as chairman, taking over on 21 February from interim chairman Ratan Tata. Tata, 79, had run the family business for more than two decades before handing over in 2012 to his hand-picked successor, Cyrus Mistry. In October, Tata Sons shocked Indias corporate community by firing Mistry, reinstalling Ratan Tata and promising to find a replacement by March. Chandra was a front runner for the job, a Tata employee almost all his working life, who grew TCS into the conglomerates most successful business, with about $16 billion in sales.Yet he is both an insider and an outsider. While he has been with the group since joining as an intern three decades ago, he is the first chairman who is not a Parsi, the shrinking ethnic group of Zoroastrians that boasts a disproportionately high number of Indias business elite. He is only the third person without the Tata name to get the job, and the first without a close family tie to the Tatas.IT CareerMoreover, his career and success has all been with TCS, virtually an island within the group that serves many of the worlds top corporations with a young, skilled, technical workforce. As head of Tata Sons, he will be responsible for a conglomerate that assembles buses in Zambia, serves prawn kalimiri to diners at its Bombay Brasserie in London, sells salt to Indian families at Rs18(27 cents) a kilo, and runs hundreds of other businesses across the world.He served both TCS and the customer commendably during the BofA-ML merger. Now he has the chance to build a positive organization by bonding together various companies and their half-a-million plus employees, said S. Ramadorai, the previous CEO of TCS. He is non-confrontational and, at the same time, does not foolishly ignore problems.Chandras appointment came after TCS announced it had made the equivalent of $1 billion in quarterly profit for the first time. Tatas star unit accounts for over half of the groups market value.A five-man panel unanimously chose Chandra from a list of more than a dozen candidates. He stood out both within the group and outside, said former bureaucrat Vijay Singh, a non-executive director on the board of Tata Sons, which ratified the selection. A Tata Sons statement said Chandra would uphold the groups values and adhere to its high standard of practicesthings the board previously accused Mistry of failing to do.We are at an inflection point, said Chandra in a statement after his appointment. I am aware that this role comes with huge responsibilities. It will be my endeavor to help progress the group with the ethos, ethics and values that the Tata group has been built on. Chandra declined an interview request for this story.Steel lossesFacing him is a menu of corporate issues, including the money-losing UK operations of Tata Steel Ltd., the overhang from failed ambitions like Tata Motors Ltd.s cheap Nano car, debt-ridden Indian Hotels Co., and a $1.17 billion arbitration battle with telecom partner NTT Docomo Inc. Mistry has previously defended his time as chairman, when he tried to reduce debt built up during a series of global acquisitions by Ratan Tata. In an e-mail to directors after his dismissal, Mistry said the group may face Rs1.18 trillion in writedowns over time because of  legacy hotspots he inherited.Mistry, whose family owns an 18% stake in Tata Sons, filed a case with the National Company Law Tribunal seeking the appointment of an administrator to oversee the companys affairs, a forensic audit and a probe into the role of the trustees of Tata trusts, the majority shareholders of Tata Sons. Hes asked for Ratan Tata, head of the trusts, to be restrained from attending board meetings. A spokesman for Mistry said he would not comment as the matter is subject to the legal proceedings.Investors expect Chandra to act quickly to resolve governance issues, said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director at proxy advisory firm InGovern Research Services Pvt. Key to his success will be how he handles Ratan Tata, who has indicated that he may step down as chairman of the trusts this year. Tata instigated the Nano project, a troubled airline venture and many of the other expansions that are now draining the groups resources.Tata congratulated Chandra on Twitter, saying he was sure the new chairman would protect the groups values and ethics. A Tata Group spokesman declined to comment.Chandra is an optimist, he thinks big and will go after positive outcomes in the new job, said Krishnakumar N., executive chairman of rival Indian IT services company Mindtree Ltd.The son of a farmer in rural southern India, Chandra studied in a Tamil-language school rather than gaining the English-language education favored by the middle class.He joined TCS in 1987 after completing a masters in Computer Applications from Regional Engineering College, Trichy, Tamil Nadu. His leadership talent was spotted by Ramadorai in 1993 when Chandra was praised by customer International Business Machines Corp. He was put in charge of a major project for British Telecommunications Plc. When Ramadorai became TCSs CEO, he chose Chandra as his executive assistant.He loved meeting customers, and it was never a Hi-How-Are-You? kind of a meeting, Ramadorai said in a telephone interview. He put the client at the center of the universe, made every conversation count and nurtured clients like American Express.Young CEOChandra took over as chief executive of TCS in 2009 at the age of 46. Over the next seven years, he would triple the IT companys share price and revenue and more than double its headcount.As Chandras corporate universe expanded, so did his interests, according to colleagues. Hes fond of photography and classical music, but his real passion is running. He has run marathons in Boston, Chicago, Berlin, New York, Tokyo and other cities.Being a runner has greatly shaped my thinking as a leader, Chandra told Runners World in October 2015. You have to decide on the length of the engagement, develop endurance to handle setbacks and increase speed when the competition demands it. You have to perform with your heart and your mind.At TCS, Chandra backed new technologies from cloud to mobile and evangelized to global corporations about digital disruption, always with a reputation for building close relationships with clients. Som Mittal, former head of Hewlett-Packard Co.s India operations, worked with Chandra for years in the software-industry trade body Nasscom and said if he texted Chandra, hed get a call back within 20 minutes.Whether he was preparing for a marathon in London or stepping into a client meeting in New York, he unfailingly called back, no matter what timezone and which corner of the globe he was in, said Mittal. He was also an inveterate traveler who would fly to client meetings even for the smallest deals. He has this uncanny ability of making everyone think they are his dearest friends.Chandra drove projects at TCS that dispersed the chaotic crowds and touts that used to clog the entrances of Indias passport offices and its best-known hospital, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi. He charted new territories for TCS in Latin America and Japan by hiring local talent.His new role comes with a different set of challenges. He will have to stabilize the group and plan a decade or two into the groups future, said Ramadorai. It is a rough road.Looming over him will be the presence of a family that has been royalty in Indias business world for more than a century, and the scion of that family, Ratan Tata.Chandra is not afraid to express opinion and can be extremely firm when he is convinced about something, said Mittal. He is no pushover. Bloomberg",2017-01-16,icSPfNFcGFeEX4LWRyqbnM,Natarajan Chandrasekaran  will take over as chairman of Tata Sons from interim chief Ratan Tata on 21 February ,12:30,N.

0.25,"On 15 January, at least 42,000 runners lined up at the starting point of the Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon, the largest road-run event in Asia. Jaspal Bindra, who came up with the idea in 2004, was nowhere to be seen. In 2016 too, he was not around. 
				   
				Bindra, the banks chief executive officer (CEO) for Asia and group executive director till early 2015, had not missed a single Mumbai Marathon till 2016. He had been living in Hong Kong from 2008 but would fly down for the eventalways held on the third Sunday in Januaryand cheer the runners. A few days ahead of the Mumbai Marathon, Bindra, 56, is a few minutes late for our luncheon meeting  at the NRI (Not Really Indian) restaurant at the Bandra-Kurla Complex in Mumbai. To avoid the hassle of choosing individual dishes, we opt for Jugal Bandi, a meal for two, accompanied by a glass of Chandon Brut each. The starters are South African peri peri wings, BBQ prawns and a Burmese green tea salad; this year-old restaurant serves Indian-inflected cuisine from around the world. As always, Bindra is dressed immaculately, in a white shirt and sky-blue turban. Some 15 years ago, over dinner at a different restaurant in south Mumbaihe was then regional general manager, India, and CEO of Standard Chartered BankBindra, digging into his chicken satay and prawn tempura, had commented, As long as I have an active sex life, I dont need to play golf. Those were not Twitter days, so it did not get wide publicity, but the banking community took note. He was perceived to be aggressive, someone who calls a spade a spade.During his two-year tenure as head of corporate and institutional banking at StanChart (1998-2000) and later as the head of both StanChart and ANZ Grindlays (he oversaw the merger of the two), Bindra showed 3,200 employees the doornearly 50% of the employee strength then.By a twist of fate, he himself had to quit the bank where he was one of the top five executives. Did he feel insecure after the StanChart board, under pressure from shareholders, asked CEO Peter Sands to leave? Bindras answer is quite logical. He was one of the top four executives of the bank reporting to Sands. The others were Mike Rees (overseeing the wholesale and retail assets), Andy Halford (group chief financial officer) and V. Shankar (another banker of Indian origin, in charge of Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Americas). Had the new CEO come from within the bank, I would have got a different responsibility. But since Sands successor came from outside, all four of us would have continued to do the same job. At mid-50s, I was looking for a different responsibility, he says. Was he eyeing the top job? Well, maybe not at that point of time but yes, if I had stuck around, I would have liked the challenge, Bindra says, nibbling on the spicy wings.He was the first to leave after Sands. By end-February 2015, he had put in his papers. Shankar and Rees followed him. Did he get a ton of money as a severance package? The standard practice in the bank is one years remuneration when a board-level executive quits. And he was not allowed to take up any job in the financial sector for a year after resigning.I cannot resist the temptation of asking how StanChart got into a situation in India where its bad assets ballooned and profits plunged. India, which accounts for anything from 15-20% of the banks global profits, and is probably the second-most important market along with Singapore, after Hong Kong, has gone through a real bad patch in the past few years. Was the local management (which was reporting to Bindra) reckless? Was it greed for balance-sheet growth that got the bank into trouble?Bindra says the bank actually weathered the collapse of Lehman Brothers well and continued to show growth in profit until 2012. Thereafter, it suffered on account of a severe structural shrinkage in commodity prices. What he means is that the companies to which the bank had exposure were in the commodity space and once they suffered, their ability to service bank loans was dented.Why did StanChart take such large exposures to so many companies in India which have in any case been over-leveraged, laden with loans they couldnt repay? Bindra says this assumption is not entirely correct. Our internal norms do not allow the bank to take more than 50% exposure in any loan. This means that even if it gives, say, a $1 billion loan to a particular company, it sells down 50-75% of it to other lenders within 90 days of disbursing the loan. So, we were as affected as others. It is not fair to say only StanChart accumulated bad assets.As the main course arrivesSri Lankan Potli Murg and dal makhani with tandoori roti and riceI decide to shift my focus to the present. Like quite a few other global Indian bankers, he is back in the country to do something on his own. Is it the proverbial return of the prodigal son? Also, what made him pick up a stake in Centrum Capital Ltd, a non-banking finance company (NBFC), and become an entrepreneur?I was 55 when I was leaving StanChart. I had three choices before meI could have got a similar job overseas and probably run a smaller bank as CEO; partially retire and join a few boards of companies and offer advisory services; or become an entrepreneur. And if I were to be an entrepreneur, it had to be in India, he says. Where else can you grow business in the banking and finance space? The public sector banks are losing their market share, foreign banks are shrinking business by design.... This is the best time to be in India. I could not afford to miss this window, Bindra says.Last April, he reportedly picked up close to a 20% stake in Centrum, started in 1995 by Bindras long-time friend Chandir Gidwani and Khushrooh Byramjee at the Bombay Mutual Building in Fort. It is a financial services firm with a presence in corporate finance, foreign exchange, wealth management, institutional broking and investment banking. It manages around Rs10,000- crore assets in its wealth management portfolio but does not have a balance sheet as such, for it does not give loans. Bindra is adding that piece to Centrum. He has started giving loans ranging from Rs5-20 crore to small and medium-size entrepreneurs. Not too many banks dabble in this segment where financing is based primarily on cash flows, not balance sheets. He has already built a portfolio of Rs400 crore in this business. Another new business is small and affordable housing finance in the range of Rs10-25 lakh. Again, there is a huge opportunity with the governments big push for affordable housing and drop in the cost of money. The third new fund-based business is private equity. We need to compete with some of the private banks and a few other NBFCs, not the entire banking system, Bindra says.When he picked up the stake in Centrum, the market value of the NBFC was Rs450 crore. Now it has crossed Rs1,500 crore. I assume that at Rs450 crore market value, for a 20% stake, he would have put in Rs90 crore. But Bindra says that may not be the correct figure as he has picked up a stake in the holding company, not the listed entity. Now all three partnersGidwani, Byramjee and Bindrahold equal stakes of around 20% each in the listed entity.After graduating from XLRI, a management school in Jamshedpur, Bindra joined Bank of America, where he spent 10 years. He spent another five at the Union Bank of Switzerland as head of business development in India before shifting to StanChart in August 1998, where he remained for 17 years. Brought up in Kolkata and many district towns in West Bengal (his father was a police officer), Bindras Bengal connection is still alive. His wife is from Asansol, and he visits his in-laws often. He can speak fluent Bengali but has not developed a sweet tooth. So, while I choose butterscotch ice cream for dessert, he orders coffee.The last round of conversation predictably revolves around demonetization. He joins the discussion a bit diplomatically. He agrees that digital banking in the unorganized sector is not easy but says that once we go cashless, the cost of operations will definitely come down and size will become less relevant for NBFCs. Currently, Centrum employs 2,000 people; for the foreign exchange business, its biggest earner, it has a presence at 19 airports and 100 outlets spread over 45 cities. Money is not a problem. There are plenty of funds available both as debt and equity. My challenge is to grow and build a solid track record and be in the reckoning to set up a bank. If available, we can buy a bank too, he says. All these, if at all, will happen after 2020. Till then, he wants to build a solid NBFC which can compete with private banks effectively.Like the Mumbai Marathon, StanCharts Indian Depository Receipts, or IDR, was also Bindras baby. He agrees with me that it was a flop. There have been issues such as tax and the class of investors who could buy IDRs. The insurance firms were never allowed to buy.... It was an experiment that failed, he says. StanChart remains the first and only foreign company to launch an IDR. But all that is behind him. I remind him of his life-size bronze statue on the eighth floor of Standard Chartered Bank Plcs old headquarters at Londons 1, Aldermanbury Squarea unique initiative of the bank to showcase the diversity of its employee base. In June 2013, the headquarters were shifted to 1, Basinghall Avenue in London. Does the new office still have his statue? He shrugs his shoulders. Bindra doesnt really care much for such things now.That day, the Centrum stock hit its lifetime high of Rs34.50. In 2016, when Bindra took over as the executive chairman and a promoter, it was trading at around Rs10.His favourite memory: Carrying the Olympic-flame torch for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.One assignment he loved: Global head of diversity and inclusion at StanChart, 2005-13.His hobby: Watching films, travelling with his wife.Favourite place on earth: Asansol, where his in-laws live (to keep his marriage alive!).One thing he would like to forget: the StanChart IDR; it was ahead of its time.One achievement he is proud of: the Mumbai Marathon.One bit of media coverage that he cherishes: Being featured in  Time magazine in 2010.",2017-01-27,ivDxiaKv9AlNq4jlbx7hyN,"Standard Chartereds man for India till early 2015, Bindra is back  now as an entrepreneur",15:32,Jaspal Bindra: Return of the prodigal son
0.27,"Sachin Bansal, co-founder and chairman of Flipkart, Indias largest e-commerce firm, cut a rather sorry figure last week when he sought government protection at a public forum to stave off competition from foreign players.
				   
				Bansal and Flipkart have had a rather tough year. It has been more than 12 months since the Bengaluru-based firm raised any kind of capital after gobbling up nearly $3 billion over the past few years.For Flipkart and the gaggle of local companies that make up Indias e-commerce sector, not having capital available on tap is a new, even alien, feeling.For nearly two years, investors of every huefrom venture capital firms to hedge funds to strategic investorsscrambled to outdo each other in bankrolling the countrys e-commerce wave, very often at valuations that are looking less and less defensible today.Last year, e-commerce companies raised a record $3.9 billion in fresh funding from investors. Flipkart and its New Delhi-based rival Snapdeal alone cornered $1.7 billion.This year, with a correction underway in the start-up funding market, the story for e-commerce has played out very differently.In the nine months to September, the sector pulled in just $1.4 billion in fresh funding. Big-ticket deals have become a thing of the past. Grocery e-tailer BigBasket, ticketing platform Bookmyshow and eyewear e-tailer Lenskart were the only three firms that pulled in serious money. BigBasket raised $150 million in March from an investor consortium led by Dubais Abraaj Group; Bookmyshow closed a $81.5 million growth round in May from a group of investors led by New York-based private equity firm Stripes Group, and Lenskart raised $60 million from International Finance Corp., TPG Growth and other investors. Another potentially large deal this year was e-commerce marketplace Shopclues growth round in January. The company didnt disclose the size of the round, but it is estimated at between $100 million and $140 million.There havent been very many more deals over the last two months, and it is unlikely that the e-commerce sector will muster much in whats left of the current quarter. Theres an outside chance that Flipkart may still score a funding round before December ends. The company, Mint reported in October, is currently in the market to raise anywhere between $500 million and $1 billion.Talks were reportedly initiated with Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the worlds largest retailer, but they dont seem to have headed anywhere productive yet. Last month, Mint reported that the e-commerce company may now seek the assistance of investment banks, something it has not done in years, to muster the next round of funds.It may be argued that Flipkart alone doesnt represent the e-commerce sector. However, given that it accounts for nearly 20% of the $15-odd billion that Indias start-ups across sectors have raised over the past decade, its ups and downs do have a bearing on the market and, especially, the e-commerce sector. The frequent valuation markdowns it has had to take over the past 11 months by mutual fund stakeholders, for instance, have impacted valuations across the consumer Internet sector, not just e-commerce. And, the fact that the biggest investor in the company, New York-based hedge fund Tiger Global Management, seems to have taken a back seat in its ongoing fund-raising campaign doesnt inspire much confidence either. In the past, Tiger Global, easily the most aggressive investor in Indias consumer Internet market until late last year, has usually taken a lead in pumping fresh capital into Flipkart.A lot of Flipkarts and the e-commerce sectors woes are due to Tiger Global and the posse of hedge funds that dominated the e-commerce funding market for the past two years. When China devalued the yuan last year, leading to a turmoil in the global financial markets, hedge funds quickly beat a retreat from Indias start-up market. Suddenly, the abundant supply of later-stage private capital that was available to the e-commerce sector, often at inordinately high valuations, vanished. For market leaders such as Flipkart and Snapdeal, this meant they now had to battle the biggest threat to their turfs, Seattle-based Amazon, on the basis of execution and unit economics rather than capital. Capital, of course, isnt a constraint for Amazon. It announced a $2 billion outlay for the Indian e-commerce market in 2014 and added another $3 billion in June this year.For venture capitalists, who were largely driven to the sidelines of the e-commerce sweepstakes by hedge funds, the market correction hasnt turned out to be such a bad thing. While funding in the e-commerce sector has slowed, early-stage and some later-stage investors continue to back companies. Niches or verticals have emerged as a theme for investments this year. At least three business-to-business marketplacesUdaan, Bizongo and Ninjacarthave raised funding worth $16 million from early-stage investors such as Accel Partners, Inventus Capital Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners and IDG Ventures India. Power2Sme also raised fresh capital but hasnt disclosed the size of the round. Another recurring theme is marketplaces for rentals of used products. Three start-upsZefo, Furlenco and Rentomojoraised a combined $26 million from investors such as Lightbox Ventures, Sequoia Capital and Helion Venture Partners.Based on a rough survey of e-commerce deals done this year, we found about 26 deals that have some kind of venture capital backing. Series A deals, the first round of venture capital in a start-up, account for 11 of those deals, indicating that early-stage investors are back to seeking out the next generation of e-commerce companies. While the verdict is out on whether the earlier generation of companiesthe Flipkarts and the Snapdealswill ride out the prevailing downturn in fortunes, Indias e-commerce wave is far from over.Snigdha Sengupta is a consulting writer with Mint.

				RGPPL, which runs the Dabhol power plant and LNG terminal in Ratnagiri district, now receives cargoes only between October and May, due to lack of a breakwater to protect vessels from choppy seas during the monsoon months. The company plans to build a breakwater facility at a cost of Rs800 crore, and is currently de-merging its power and LNG businesses into separate entities.

0.48,"Mumbai: Shareholders of Tata Motors Ltd voted on a resolution on Thursday to remove Nusli Wadia as a director at the companys extraordinary general meeting (EGM).
				   
				Though the voting results were not released at the time of going to press, the odds seemed to be  stacked against the industrialist who has been a director on the Tata Motors board for more than 18 years, if the number of shareholders who spoke in favour of the resolution seeking his removal was any indication. Tata Sons, the Tata group holding company, in November sought the removal of Wadia as director of Tata Steel, Tata Motors and Tata Chemicals. Tata Sons controls 26.51% of Tata Motors, 29.75% of Tata Steel and 19.35% of Tata Chemicals.ALSO READ | Nusli Wadia removed as Tata Steel directorEarlier this month, Wadia filed a Rs3,000 crore defamation suit against Ratan Tata and the board of Tata Sons.Global proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (ISS) questioned the rationale behind resolution to seek removal of Wadia, an independent director at three Tata companies. Proxy advisory firm Stakeholder Empowerment Services (SES) on the other hand, recommended shareholders of Tata Steel, Tata Motors and Tata Chemicals to vote in favour of a resolution to remove him. Both developments happened earlier this month.Sixty-three people spoke at the EGM; most spoke in favour of the resolution.Before the meeting, Wadia, who did not attend the EGM, had made his case to the companys shareholders in a letter. Wadia said he had chosen not to attend, calling the recent EGMs as inappropriately and shamefully stage-managed.Wadia, 72, was removed as an independent director from the board of Tata Steel Ltd late on Wednesday with a majority of both institutional and retail investors voting against him at an EGM. On Friday, he will face a similar test at an EGM called by Tata Chemicals Ltd to remove him.Wadias four-page letter to Tata Motors shareholders, dated 21 December, spoke of attempts by Tata Sons to influence independent directors and the board of Tata Motors through unsigned legal opinions. These opinions, he said, were circulated just hours before a company board meeting to influence, intimidate and muzzle the independent directors from communicating with the stock exchanges.He wrote about the companys ill-conceived investments in low-cost passenger car Nano and the delay in its closure leading to a serious drain on the finances of the company. Wadia said every sale of Nano was at a substantial loss to Tata Motors, with total losses on Nano running into thousands of crores.Wadia also wrote about cross-holdings in Tata companies, the largest of which, he said, was Tata Sons valued at Rs8,600 crore.Wadia said the cross-holdings were being held in Tata Motors, a debt-ridden company, to keep voting control over Tata Sons. The listed companies as a whole have blocked approximately Rs70,000 crore in holding Tata Sons shares equivalent to 14% of its capital with the sole purpose of shoring up the voting rights of the (Tata) Trust(s).It is for you the shareholders of Tata Motors who own 70% of the shares of your company to decide whether you want to be the holder of Tata Sons shares with minimum return, zero liquidity and no exit, he wrote.Wadia said it was the first time in Tata Motors history that a productivity-linked settlement was agreed, initiated and was to be signed with the union in Pune after 14 months of discussion, but Ratan Tata met the union and asked them to support the change in leadership. The union subsequently issued a statement that their relationship with the management of the company had taken a downward trend over the issues. This irresponsible action galvanizing and acting prejudicially against the interest of your company may jeopardise its future and impact the overall morale of all the workers and employees of Tata Motors. The letter also pointed to the impact on the passenger vehicle business due to issues in design, product, quality, execution and high costs being directed from the top. The division has high capital employed, high level of loss that impacts overall financials of the company, he wrote. What is at stake now is not whether I am removed or not, but the fate of the very institution of the independent director that has been created in law and by Sebi (capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India) to safeguard the interests of all stakeholders, the letter said.On Wednesday, Wadia had said that the ability of promoter Tata Sons to seek removal of independent directors from group company boards could force them to either toe the line, resign or face removal.",2016-12-22,jFgUgkZQ86jpARNXaZ6grJ,"A number of shareholders, at the Tata Motors EGM, spoke in favour of the resolution seeking Nusli Wadias removal was any indication",11:29,Odds stacked against Nusli Wadia at Tata Motors EGM

				To be sure, the market has always had lingering concerns on the asset quality of some lenders such as ICICI Bank Ltd and Axis Bank even when they were doing well in other yardsticks such as credit growth or margins or net profit growth. Thats why these two banks had traded at a good discount to HDFC Bank Ltd, which has predominantly retail loans in its portfolio.Some of these fears have come true in recent times.For Axis Bank Ltd, gross bad loans rose 36.7% to Rs.6,087 crore in the six months ended 31 March. For ICICI Bank, bad loans have risen by almost two-thirds in the same period to Rs.26,221 crore. And investors have shown their displeasure by beating down share prices more than the benchmark Bankex since the company reported its September quarter earnings. Axis Bank has lost 10% of its value and ICICI Bank almost 20%.Now, both banks have decided to share more information about potential stressed assets rather than let market speculation run riot. Those numbers show that things have not turned the corner.Axis Bank created an asset quality watch list of Rs.22,268 crore loans that are likely to be the source of future stress. Of this, it expects 60%, or Rs.13,361 crore, to go bad over the next two years, a number higher than the combined slippages of the past two fiscal years.ICICI Banks watch list is more than double the size at Rs.52,638 crore. This includes already restructured loans of Rs.8,573 crore, loans under the strategic debt restructuring process (SDR) and 5/25 refinancing scheme. Overall, the bank has indicated that it has about 13.3% exposure (including non-funded exposures) in stressed sectors such as power, mining, iron and steel, cement and rigs. Of this, 4.8%, or Rs.44,000 crore, are at high risk and may slip into NPAs in the coming quarters. Therefore, the bank has created a reserve of Rs.3,600 crore as contingency provisions against this exposure.This grim outlook will also have a bearing on other yardsticks such as credit growth and profitability. ICICI Bank, for instance, has guided for 5-7% growth in corporate loans as it switches its focus to higher rated firms and reduces concentration risks in its portfolio. This will naturally dent margins as well.With private corporate earnings yet to show a meaningful improvement, and investment demand some time away amid the highest level of stalled projects in a couple of years, these lenders will continue feeling the heat.",2016-05-01,jIPlZ7HOg8Xa1BjN4ucnKO,"With earnings yet to show meaningful improvement, and investment demand some time away, private lenders will continue feeling the heat

				In his budget speech, Jaitley said full electrification of 18,452 villages identified in 2015 will be achieved by 1 March 2018, for which Rs4,814 crore will be spent in the next financial year, a 43%jump from what is estimated to have spent this fiscal. Of this, so far, close to 12,000 villages have been electrified.Jaitly announced setting up of 20 GW of solar power capacity and feeding 7,000 railway stations with solar power, giving a major impetus to the shift to clean energy. Over the last two years, the share of solar power in the countys energy mix has been gradually increasing, while that of thermal power has been declining. As on 31 December, thermal power capacity accounts for 69% of the countrys 310 gigawatt (GW) power generation capacity, while solar power account for 2.7%.Also read:Union Budget 2017: Key highlightsSolar energy, with the help of government policies and the falling global prices, is now at an inflection point where it can compete on its own against other forms of energy, said Sanjeev Aggarwal, managing director and chief executive of Amplus Energy Solutions Pvt.

India has already built underground crude oil storage capacities at three locationsVishakhapatnam, Mangalore and Padur with a total 5.3 million tonne capacity. The facility at Vishakhapatnam has already been filled up and half of the Mangalore storage facility has been filled.

0.47,"New Delhi: Demonetisation is likely to push back recovery in banks asset quality as the cash shortage had a disruptive impact on Indias informal economy, rating agency Fitch said on Tuesday. 
				   
				The impact of demonetisation on asset quality will start showing significantly in data for the January-March quarter, the rating agency said. Demonetisation is likely to push back the recovery in Indian banks asset quality, given the disruptive impact that cash shortages have had on the countrys large informal economy, Fitch Ratings said in a statement. Cash shortages caused by the demonetisation of large denomination currency notes have affected the income of many borrowers by holding back economic activity and reduced their short-term repayment abilities. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has allowed forbearance on some loans to the agricultural sector and small businesses, but these account for a relatively small share of outstanding lending, Fitch said. Fitch had previously expected the stressed-asset ratio for Indian banks to increase to 12% for the fiscal ending March 2017, from 11.4% in FY16.There is now a risk that the ratio will climb higher. We still believe that asset-quality indicators are close to their weakest level and will recover slowly over the next few years, but any turnaround is likely to have been pushed back by at least two quarters, it said. Demonetisation has also weighed on loan growth, at least in the short term as demand weakened in the uncertain economic environment and banks have had to focus on cash management instead of normal lending activities. Loan growth slowed to 4.8% in November 2016, from 6.7% in October. We now think it is likely that loan growth will be below our previous forecast of 10% in FY17 and may even slow from the 8.8% recorded in FY16, Fitch said. Banks have received a surge of low-cost funds as demonetised notes were deposited. Deposit growth accelerated to 15.9% year-on-year in November, from 9.2% in October, and the handful of banks that have released figures for the October-December quarter have reported low-cost deposit growth of 25-30% y-o-y. We think there is scope for further lending rate cuts, but much will depend on the proportion of new deposits that remains in the banking system. The lasting impact on bank depositsand lending rateswill become clear only after withdrawal limits are lifted, Fitch added. The government had demonetised Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes on 8 November 2016. It had then asked holders of such notes to deposit in bank accounts.

Kamarajar, which runs the port at Ennore near Chennai, was formed as a firm under the Companies Act 1956 when it was opened in 2001.Under the restrictive ambit of the MPT Act, the major ports are finding it difficult to operate in a highly competitive environment and respond to market challenges, according to Indias shipping ministry.This argument was also used to explain, among other things, why major ports were underperforming when compared with their private-sector counterparts.The fact is that none of the major ports, including a corporate port such as Kamarajar, attempted to raise external commercial borrowings in the past, though some of them did take loans from the domestic market.It was Nitin Gadkari, Indias shipping minister, who showed that this can be done.Gadkari argued that the dozen ports can use their dollar earnings to borrow money at cheaper rates from overseas, instead of availing high-cost rupee loans at interest rates of 12-14% from the domestic market.The plan was first put to test for a road widening project linking JN Port for faster evacuation of cargo.Six banksICICI Bank Ltd, EXIM Bank, Deutsche Bank AG, Citibank NA, DBS Bank and SBIhad also submitted quotations for the loan to be split in two tranches with tenures of seven-and-a-half years and 10 years.The mandate was finally given to SBI and DBS Bank. JN Port will raise $300 million from SBI and $100 million from DBS at rates under 4%. JN Port will service the loan from its dollar earnings.However, there is a small hitch here.Vessel-related charges, or so-called marine charges, such as port dues, berth hire and pilotage, are paid by ships calling at a port. Vessel-related charges for foreign-going vessels are denominated in dollars, but collected in rupees after applying the prevailing exchange rate, according to a practice followed since 1991.Cargo-related charges at ports such as wharfage, crane hire, storage, warehouse, demurrage and estate rentals are denominated and collected in rupees.JN Port has sought approval from the government and the Reserve Bank of India to also collect the vessel-related charges in dollars during the loan repayment period to hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates.JN Ports success in raising a dollar-denominated loan could prod other major ports to look at this avenue to raise cheaper funds for expansion. Cheaper loans will improve the viability of projects and fetch better returns.The major ports have been increasingly losing market share to new-generation private ports. In the year ended March 2016, the 12 ports loaded 606.374 million tonnes (mt) of cargo, accounting for about 55% of Indias external trade by volume shipped by sea.The dollar loan borrowed by JN Port also goes to show that operational improvements and competitiveness can be brought about without changing the structure if there is political will and support from port workers. In fact, this has already started manifesting itself. The combined operating income of the major ports rose 8% from Rs.10,190 crore in 2014-15 to Rs.10,961 crore in 2015-16. Their operating surplus rose 19% from Rs.3,593 crore in 2014-15 to Rs.4,268 crore in 2015-16. Operating margin increased from 35% in 2014-15 to 39% in 2015-16. The profit margin of the 12 ports improved from 27% during 2013-14 to 39% in 2015-16. The improvement is due to an overall reduction in the average turnaround time of ships (time taken by ships to berth, unload cargo and sail off) calling at the major ports. In ports such as Paradip, V.O. Chidambaranar and Visakhapatnam, the average turnaround time was cut by over 40%. These operational efficiencies and improvements can be used as a bargaining tool by port workers to stall a government plan to undertake structural reform of the major port trusts and convert them into companies. The plan involves bringing the 11 port trusts under a new law called the Major Port Authorities Act, which will have provisions to undertake this task.P.

				According to Crif High Mark Credit Information Services, a credit bureau, around 1.26 million microfinance borrowers had received top-up loans over and above their existing loan amounts as of December end. According to Crif High Mark, top-up loans are defined as those with a ticket size of less than Rs10,000 and where customers have at least two active loans. Typically, such a loan is taken out for up to nine months.ALSO READ | The new hotspots of Indian microfinanceWorryingly, 70% of these borrowers have at least three loans running at the same time. While Reserve Bank of India guidelines mandate that not more than two microfinance Institutions (MFIs) can give loan to the same borrower simultaneously, the guidelines are silent about borrowing from other lenders. This means many people take out loans from multiple sources.Average exposure for these customers (those who had top-ups) is Rs45,400 which is more than the double of national average figure, Rs22,000. Also, 17% of these customers with top-up loans are servicing five loans at a time, said Kalpana Pandey, managing director and chief executive officer, Crif High Mark.Several years ago, many small borrowers in Andhra Pradesh were provided loans from multiple, and many borrowers used one loan to repay the other, leading to over-indebtedness over time. There were reports of coercive tactics to recover money, forcing the government to issue an ordinance in 2010 to correct the irregularities.ALSO READ | Where do microfinance firms go from here?While the number of borrowers receiving top-up loans pales in comparison to the 42 million MFI borrowers in India, the total loans outstanding to these borrowers stood significantly higher at Rs5,900 crore as of December end, with top-up loans accounting for Rs369 crore of this amount. The total loans outstanding to microfinance borrowers stood at Rs93,800 crore, of which microfinance companies and banks held 62% and 28% respectively, December-end data showed.We devised life cycle products for our customer for their various requirements throughout the year, to avoid them to go to money lenders. We dont look at only one loan for customer since cash flow for these borrowers dips so many times in a financial year, said Udaya Kumar, managing director and chief executive of Grameen Koota Financial Services Pvt. Ltd, a Karnataka-based micro lender. Such top-up cases are more frequent in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu because they are more matured markets, Kumar added. Crif data reveals that Tamil Nadu and Karnataka constitute almost half the top-up cases.

0.63,"Singapore: Monday evenings coup at Bombay House, the headquarters of Indias steel-to-software conglomerate Tata, was as swift as it was abrupt.
				   
				Not only did the board of Tata Sons, the holding company, dump Cyrus Mistry as chairman after less than four years, it also brought back Ratan Tata, 78, as the interim boss, leaving nobody in any doubt that the founding family of the 148-year-old empire was reasserting control.But what made Tata reach for the nuclear option?The companys brief statement gave no clues, though conspiracy theories range from Mistrys futile attempts at micro-managing a maddening potpourri of companies, to not having a nose for talent (a six-member executive council put together by him was also disbanded), and selling the family silver to pay down debt when he should have focused more on growth.Investors in Tatas suite of operating companies were picking up signs of discord, but were still unprepared for a coup. After all, Ratan Tata seemed to be nothing less than delighted when a selection committee tasked to find his successor returned from a 15-month global hunt with the idea that Mistry  a member of the search panel as well as the son of a large shareholder  was the best choice. If the 48-year-old executive is now being removed for being out of his depth, the more experienced Ratan Tata deserves some blame for putting him in that position in the first place.Also Read: Understanding the Tata Sons boardroom coupBesides, its not clear that Mistry was doing a lousy job. Start the clock in late August 2004, when the IPO of software business Tata Consultancy created the group as it exists today. In the subsequent eight years that Tata guided the behemoth, a market capitalization-weighted index of its 26 listed units barely managed to beat the Sensex. Over a shorter time frame, Mistry has outperformed the benchmark more convincingly.When it comes to future returns, though, Ratan Tata may have reasons to be anxious about the direction in which Mistry was steering the ship.Tata took advantage of a China-fueled boom in commodity demand to load up on debt, which led to an eightfold expansion in the annual net income of the groups publicly traded companies in the six years through 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But with overcapacity in the Peoples Republic hitting the groups steel business hard, profitability waned.In wanting to reduce leverage by selling everything from money-losing UK steel operations to coal mines in Indonesia and hotels in the US, Mistry has veered too far away from his predecessors expansionist strategy. With the pace of capital expenditure down to a 12-month run rate of $2 billion versus $3.7 billion in Tatas final year at the helm, the group runs the risk of courting irrelevance. Also Read: Cyrus Mistry ouster could slow Tata groups debt reduction processMore worrisome, from a Tata perspective, is that the group nowadays makes news mostly for the wrong reasons. Whether its an almost $1 billion jury award against its software unit for a US intellectual-property infringement case, or the embarrassment of losing a $1.17 arbitration brought against Tata Sons by NTT Docomo for alleged failure to honour a partnership contract, the conglomerates reputation for good corporate citizenship has taken a beating.Its hard to say if Mondays putsch will fix everything from strategic wobbles to PR snafus. Investors will want to see if the mutiny leads to a bounty in the form of superior shareholder returns. That depends mainly on whether the search panel gets lucky this time around. Pending the induction of the new chairman, however, what matters is how operating companies  and their bosses  react to Ratan Tatas return.For now, palace intrigue looks unlikely to affect performance.

0.25,"Singapore: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds entry into the telecom space is set to change the composition of the Indian economy, and its impact will be felt across all sectors, and investors should look at companies that are set to benefit from this communications revolution, said Mark Mobius, executive chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets Group at Franklin Templeton Investments.
				   
				Mobius, who oversees the Templeton research team based in 18 global emerging markets offices, said he would give high marks for the performance of the Narendra Modi government so far. He cautioned that after  the passage of reforms, the focus would shift to implementation.We have got to see implementation of those reforms so that the economy can grow and accelerate and continue on the high growth rate. So, I would say India offers an opportunity and a pitfall, and we have to keep an eye out for it, he added in an interview.Edited excerpts: India has recently seen three big reforms over the past few monthsthe goods and services tax, a relaxation in foreign direct investment norms and the bankruptcy law being passed. As an investor, how do you view these steps? Are these the last of the big reforms from the Modi government?All those steps are very good and the tax one is excellent. Now, what has to be done is implementation, because implementation with each state is really the key going forward. So, we have to look and see how fast implementation can take place, because that will determine the success of this reform. But, we are very excited about these changes, and the impact, of course, will be far-reaching, and will really be very dramatic going forward. Thats really the key, because we must not overlook the fact that implementation is probably more difficult. Getting passed in Parliament is one thing, but getting each state to implement it, to reduce the bureaucracy, to make things more efficientthat is really the key to success.The perception among investors outside is that the Indian markets are expensive. We are very excited about the Indian market. If you look at global firms, youll notice that India rating has been increasing. We are definitely very focused on India. Growth rate is very high, and we believe that this will continue with the reforms that we have seen, and so we are quite excited about it.Which are the sectors in the Indian market that you are excited about?First one, of course, is techsoftware, in particular, is very good for us. Secondly, it is the consumer sector and, particularly with the tax reform, I believe that the consumer sector will really surge ahead. Also, the companies and industries that will benefit from the revolution in communications with RILs (Reliance Industries Ltds) entry into telecoms, they are going to make telecommunicationsdatacheaper for everyone in India. This will set off a revolution in innovation and, I believe, companies that can benefit from that will really be the ones that you would want to look at. A lot of that will be consumer-oriented.How do you see RILs entry into telecoms? Will it be a game changer?No question about it. It is going to be a game changer. By bringing down the cost of the telecoms, and by enabling people to utilize telecommunications in a bigger way, cheaper, faster and more efficient way, the entire composition of the economy will change. This goes for the financial sector, it goes for the consumer sector, even goes for the industrial sectorso, everybody will be impacted by this. Its true that the competition has been hurt temporarily with RILs entry, but I think they will step up to the plate and be ready to compete.Which sectors in the Indian market should one avoid at this time?I think it is not avoidbut we have to be very cautious when it comes to the finance sector. As I mentioned, the changes that telecommunications and mobile will bring about to banking and transfer of moneythat is going to have a big impact on the financial sector. Those financial sector companies that are not able to keep up, they will be at a disadvantage. The other area is the companies that have benefited from the restrictionsstate restrictions, border control restrictions, tax restrictionsthese companies are going to be impacted soon, and we have to be very careful. Again, the companies which had state monopolies in certain areas because of the inability of competitors to come inthose companies are going to be impacted, too. So, we have to be careful about not picking these companies. Recently, in your blog, you had said while India is growing faster than China, the latter continues to be your top bet among emerging markets.Thats mainly because of the size of China. You have a lot of liquid and large companies in the China market, and access is easy through the Hong Kong market, which enables us to get in and out of Chinese companies. However, with these reforms in India, you will see the rating on India increase. If you see our global funds, you will see that happening already.Overall, how worried or optimistic are you on China?I am pretty optimistic about China. I know people are concerned about the debt, about the leverage, etc., but at the end of the day, it is a communist-controlled society, and they can control the heavy leverage that a lot of the companies have. As you know, the big banks and big companies there are all controlled by the government... Its a big economygrowth is continuing not only because of government spending, but also because of private sector growth. So, were optimistic. But in a country like that, just like in India, there will be winners and losers. We have to be very careful in stock selection.In a recent blog, you said that in 2016, emerging markets have outperformed developed markets in US dollar terms. What is your take on the mid-term and long-term performance of emerging markets equities when compared with the developed markets?In the long term, there is no question that emerging markets will outperform for the simple reason that economic growth in emerging markets will continue to be at least double that of the developed countries. So, as long as that is the case, we can expect emerging markets to outperform. If you look at history, there is a correlation between market performance and economic growth. So, thats an important point to keep in mind. The other thing is that there is a slew of frontier marketscountries that are just starting out in the market economy adventure and these companies and countries will be growing at a very fast pace because theyre starting from a low base. That also will boost emerging markets generally.How do you see the emerging markets being impacted by the gradual increase in US interest rates?Its very important to look at the history of interest rates and emerging markets performance. If you compare the US Feds funds rate against the emerging markets performance, there is no real correlation. For example, the period between 1988 and 1993, interest rates went down and the emerging markets went up. Everybody expects a correlation between interest rates and performance; but then, if you look at the period from 2003 to 2007, interest rates went up and the emerging markets boomed. From 2007-09, the correlation held because interest rates went down and the emerging markets went down. So, its different from what you would expect. I think people are putting too much weight on the interest rate, particularly the US Federal Reserve rate and what the markets will do. There is a good chance that if the US Fed raises the interest rate, then emerging markets could outperform. You just cannot say that when interest rates go up, the market goes down. It doesnt work that way. History shows thats not the case.How do you rate the performance of the Modi government so far? Do you think it has delivered on many of its promises in terms of reforms, in terms of ease of doing business?I think there was too much euphoria when they were elected, and we foresaw that they would have difficulty in the beginning. So, we didnt expect the tremendous surge of reforms because we knew the barriers that they were facing in Parliament and so forth. However, the fact that they have been able to pass the tax reform and that they have been able to make changes is very heartening to us. To us, it indicates that the Modi government has done a pretty good job. I would have like to see (former Reserve Bank of India governor) Raghuram Rajan to stay on in the central bank. That is probably one negative to the Modi government; but then, if his successor continues on the same policies in a quiet way, then it should be OK. I would say we would give them high marks for performance.In India, what do you feel are the challenges and risks going forward?Again, it is not just the degree to which reform takes place. We have got to see implementation of those reforms so that the economy can grow and accelerate and continue on the high growth rate. So, I would say India offers an opportunity and a pitfall, and we have to keep an eye out for it.How do you see the private equity space in South-East Asia?Its very good. It is a great opportunity here in South-East Asia because there are so many new enterprises that are getting started and, of course, the impact of China on South-East Asia, in most parts, is very positive. China is, of course, the main trading partner, and as China surges ahead, these countries will be pulled along with them. So, lots of opportunities in the private sector area.",2016-09-22,kFXB0BUoKhEy9eTdD8w8JM,"Templetons emerging markets fund manager Mark Mobius says Reliance Jios launch will only  impact the telecom space, but also other sectors and the Indian economy",07:50,Reliance Jios entry a game changer: Mark Mobius

0.32,"Rallis India Ltd beat Street estimates in the December quarter (Q3). Revenues increased 7.5%. As raw material costs as a percentage of sales dropped, margins expanded, resulting in a 17% rise in operating profit. Thanks to high other income and low finance costs, net profit grew at an even faster pace of 30%.
				   
				But the performance is nothing to be excited about. One, it comes on a favourable basesales in Q3 of the last fiscal year were down 20%. Two, the December quarter also reflects spillover sales of the summer crop season which got extended due to dry spells. Three, the revenue beat comes on tempered-down earnings estimates, especially after a subdued first half and note ban-induced liquidity problems.Still, the company did reasonably well, given the challenges such as pricing pressures and unfavourable climatic conditions. According to Rallis, the huge shortfall (62% deficit) in northeast monsoon (which occurs in October-December) impacted the southern states, affecting the sowing of paddy and coarse cereals. As a consequence, revenues at the seeds division fell from the year-ago quarter.But thanks to higher crop acreages, up 6% as of the past week, and heightened marketing efforts, Rallis managed to register better sales. According to Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd, volumes were higher in the domestic business, though realizations came under pressure.Including the December quarter, revenues so far this fiscal are up about 12%. In the previous fiscal year till the December quarter, they fell 14%. So, 2016-17 has been a better year for Rallis. But the growth is not as strong as the initial forecasts.With winter crop sowing (rabi) also getting elongated, analysts expect Rallis to see some kind of spillover sales in the current quarter also. But considering that a major crop season (kharif) ended with subdued growth, a significant jump in sales is unlikely unless exports pick up drastically. This dawning realization is leading to a reduction in estimates as many analysts had forecast 2016-17 to be even better. We cut our FY17/18 revenue estimates by 8% each to factor in  lower-than-anticipated growth in 9MFY17, Emkay said in a note. Our FY17 EPS (earning per share) remains unchanged as the company has been receiving higher other income due to increase in current investments resulting from gain on sale of land.Demonetization is expected to stretch working capital due to a delay in collections. But key to the Rallis stock, which is trading at 20 times one-year forward earnings estimates, is growth. It is crucial the company maintains the growth tempo in Q4.

Consolidated revenue rose 16.2% from a year ago to Rs84,189 crore.Earnings were boosted by a 12% increase in so-called other income, or income thats generated from avenues other than its main businesses, to Rs2,736 crore in the December quarter.The refining business has delivered eight consecutive quarters of double-digit GRMs (gross refining margins), benefitting from the global demand for transportation fuels and improved product cracks, said Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director.ALSO READ | Reliance Jio to add $4.4 bn in funding as Mukesh Ambani builds war chestGRM, or what the company earns from turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel, widened to $10.8 per barrel compared to $10.1 in the September quarter. Analysts had expected RILs GRM to be between $10.5 per barrel and $11.5 per barrel. During the quarter, the benchmark Singapore complex margin increased by $1.5 per barrel sequentially to $6.7 per barrel. RILs revenue from the refining segment was up at 7.5% at Rs61,693 crore.RIL is the operator of the worlds biggest oil-refinery complex with a refining capacity of 1.24 million barrels of oil per day, located at Jamnagar in Gujarat.The companys petrochemicals business sprang a surprise. Analysts had expected the segment to show weaker numbers on the back of falling margins and demonetization.Segment revenue in the petrochemicals business grew 17.8% to Rs22,584 crore. Earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) grew faster at 25.5%. As a result, the petrochemical margin was a better-than-expected 14.4%, up 80 basis points from a year ago. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.ALSO READ | Reliance Jio customer base crosses 72.4 million by 31 DecemberDemonetization has had no impact from our overall earnings point of view. Overall impact from demonetization has been positive for core retail business, said V.Srikanth, joint CFO of Reliance Industries.The stand-alone oil and gas segment saw revenue decline 8.4% to Rs1,215 crore. This decline was led by lower production in domestic blocks.RILs KG-D6 basin produced 0.26 million barrels of crude oil in the second quarter, down 28% from the year earlier. Natural gas production too declined 29% year-on-year to 24.4 billion cubic feet.Srikanth said the company was close to its peak debt at Rs1.18 trillion. In the previous quarter, the company said it will spend an additional Rs1 trillion on Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd by 2020, taking its total investment in the venture to Rs2.5 trillion.Reliance Jio had managed to enrol 72 million subscribers as of 31 December 2016. According to the management, it is adding an average 600,000 subscribers per day. Reliance Jio is now planning to raise Rs30,000 crore from a rights offer and will use the proceeds to enhance its network capacity. While the petrochemicals business has done well because of stable margins and higher volumes, the future driver will be the telecom venture, said Dhaval Joshi, an analyst at Mumbai-based Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd, told Bloomberg. The stocks big movement hereon depends on how quickly telecom operations turn around.The organised retail business saw revenue grow by 7.5% to Rs8,688 crore.Ahead of the earnings announcement, RIL shares closed at Rs1,077, down 1.21% on the BSE, while the benchmark Sensex was up 0.18% to 27,288.17 points.

Engineering goods exports fell by more than a quarter, textiles by 6.1% and leather by 12.1%. To be sure, lack of demand and deflation worldwide is one reason for this sharp fall.

-0.29,"June quarter results are not easily comparable on a year-on-year basis due to the change in accounting standards for non-financial companies from 1 April 2016. Even so, on a relative basis, small-sized firms remain laggards vis-à-vis large and medium-sized companies.
				   
				This is interesting especially in light of the ongoing rally in mid- and small-cap stocks. Of course, while there will be a variance in the performance of different companies and sectors, as a category, small firms have done quite poorly. The chart shows net sales and operating profit growth of listed companies in the June quarter. Banks and financial institutions have been left out because their businesses are very different and they have been affected by the clean-up of bad loans started by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Firms in the oil and gas sector have been excluded because of the volatility in their earnings.These non-bank, non-oil firms have been divided into six categories based on the size of their revenues. As the chart shows, the growth in net sales and operating profits for small-sized firms has been dismal in the June quarter. Firms with net sales of below Rs100 crore reported a 12.3% decline in revenues on a cumulative basis, while companies with net sales of over Rs1,000 crore reported a 2.1% growth in revenues. The subdued performance of smaller firms is also reflected in bank credit data. Latest RBI data shows that bank credit to large industrial units grew on a year-on-year basis while that to medium and micro and small industrial units declined.Despite the unimpressive earnings performance, many mid-cap and small-cap stocks are trading at expensive valuations after the sharp run-up that they have seen this year. But that, according to some experts, is largely driven by the underlying bullish sentiment in the market rather than these firms earnings.According to a recent Kotak Institutional Equities report, earnings will become more relevant as the effects of global and domestic macro factors fade. Domestic positive events such as implementation of the seventh pay commission recommendations, a good monsoon and a decline in interest rates have partly played out but are largely priced in, and the markets focus is likely to shift increasingly to earnings and fundamentals as the scope for re-rating of multiples is quite limited, the report said.As such, investors should be increasingly cautious about riding the mid- and small-cap rally blindly.",2016-09-26,m53fkCkiFeDPkBvq5zyYjM,"while there will be a variance in the performance of different companies and sectors, as a category, small firms have done quite poorly.",23:34,Small firms remain on a weak footing in June quarter

More than half of its capital expenditure is done by purchasing property and equipment using leases. If the purchases had been made outright, FCF would reduce by $5.2 billion. At the least, principal repayments for these leases should be reduced, in which case FCF would reduce by $2.6 billion. Then, the company regularly makes acquisitions, and adjusting for this would reduce FCF by another $800 million. A look at the chart alongside shows how far removed Amazons adjusted FCF is vis-à-vis FCF derived from the traditional calculation. In 2015, free cash amounts to only around $1.3 billion after making these adjustments, less than a fifth of what headline numbers suggest.Also Read: Would you buy a policy or a fund on Flipkart or Paytm?

Some analysts also suggest adjusting for stock-based compensations ($2.1 billion), stating that this should be viewed as normal cash wages, which is how employees see them. But that may be taking things too far. The fact remains that stock-based compensations are a non-cash expense, and thanks to Amazons premium valuations ($336 billion), they result in negligible equity dilution.Even so, Amazon isnt as flush with cash as some perceive. Why else would its long-term debt and other long-term liabilities (leases etc.) rise to $18.2 billion at the end of December 2015, from $15.7 billion a year before that. The value of cash and marketable securities rose from $17.4 billion to $19.8 billion; but adjusted for long-term liabilities, theres not all that much cash left to speak of.Besides, the company continues to invest heavily in established markets, largely on its cloud computing services initiative, Amazon Web Services. So its not like Amazon has firmly rooted itself in developed markets, and now has the luxury of using all its cash to conquer emerging markets such as India. Indeed, a clear sign that it is far from being well established in its main markets is the widening deficit between its shipping revenue and shipping costs. The deficit stood at $5 billion, $4.2 billion and $3.5 billion in the past three years5% of net sales in each of the years. This is hardly a sign of a company raking in the money. Instead, Amazon continues to underprice some of its services even in markets where it is well established. In the process, it is sacrificing profit margins as well as cash flow in order to grow revenues and establish customer loyalty. Yet, having said all this, Amazon India is still miles ahead of counterparts such as Flipkart when it comes to funding. The latter are utterly dependent on private investors to fund their cash burn. If the current ebb in funding continues, they will struggle to survive. Amazon, on the other hand, can raise $6 billionmore than what all Indian e-commerce and Internet companies raised last yearby selling less than 2% of its equity.Also Read: Flipkart gets tougher with its sellers

One hope for Indian e-tailers will be that public investors start acting tough with Amazon, and force it to be less profligate, just as private investors have with them. In end-2014, Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University, wrote in his blog, I would argue that markets have been extraordinarily forgiving of Amazons long loss-making history and have given (Amazon CEO) Mr (Jeff) Bezos breaks that very few companies have received through time. But there are hardly any signs of Bezos facing any significant investor ire. Investors are still buying into his pitch of building revenues now and profits coming in later. Some of them are clearly buying into the cash flow generation story.As pointed out earlier, Indian e-tailers neednt be overawed by Amazons seemingly huge free cash flow. But they sure have a tough fight on their hands.",2016-06-24,m7ZuSH2NWeFz1rOuUDDTSM,"While funding from private investors has decelerated considerably since Q4 FY15, it looks like Amazon has upped the tempo with cash flow generation.

Gross bad loans as a percentage of total loans were 1.05 percent in the December quarter, versus 1.02 percent in the September quarter.HDFC Bank has far lower bad loans than its bigger rivals, thanks to its stronger retail business and smaller exposure to project finance.Indias banking industry has been hit by the governments shock cancellation in November of 86 percent of its currency in circulation, which forced many institutions to scramble to replace the high-value banknotes.The banking sector also continues to battle record sour assets with the regulator setting a March deadline for a clean up.Despite the banknote ban hitting credit demand in many sectors, HDFC Bank said its domestic advances as of end-December grew about 17.5 percent from a year earlier.That helped net interest income for the quarter grow 18 percent to Rs8,309 crore, HDFC Bank said.

0.05,"London: Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc said it will take a £3.1 billion ($3.8 billion) charge in its fourth-quarter results, as the lender used other banks settlements to estimate the impact from a US probe into sales of mortgage securities.
				   
				The lender is continuing to cooperate with the US Department of Justice on its investigation, though timing of a settlement remains uncertain, the Edinburgh-based bank said Thursday in a statement. RBS has now taken £6.7 billion of provisions related to as many as 15 mortgage investigations and lawsuits, and said further charges may still be needed.RBS is among the final global lenders yet to settle in a years-long probe thats garnered more than $50 billion in penalties for the DOJ since it began investigating the pre-crisis sale of mortgage bonds. Bloomberg reported last week that the UK taxpayer-owned lender was considering taking a provision based partly on Deutsche Bank AGs $7.2 billion settlement and Credit Suisse Group AGs $5.3 billion accord, both announced in December.RBS investors, including the UK government, are paying a heavy price for decisions made by RBS before the crisis. Its another painful example of that legacy, chief executive officer Ross McEwan said on a call with reporters. The charge reflects the legacy of time when RBS lost its way on its quest to build a global bank.The shares gained 1.9% to 231.8 pence at 8:38am in London trading on Thursday. The stock declined 26% last year.Although the lenders board was able to make the fresh provision based on other European banks settlements, chief financial officer Ewen Stevenson said RBS isnt yet in any active negotiations with the Justice Department. McEwan said he wouldnt speculate on whether changes in the US administration under President Donald Trump may change the tone of any talks or delay the process. Were keen to resolve this as quick as we can, McEwan said on the call with reporters. Well work constructively with the appropriate authorities whoever they are.RBSs fourth-quarter charge is larger than the £2.7 billion that Citigroup Inc. analysts led by Andrew Coombs predicted in a note to clients last month. The provision would have reduced the banks common equity Tier 1 capital ratio by 1.35 percentage points based on where it stood in September, RBS said.If the $3.8 billion provided for today ends up being the settlement amount with the DOJ on such matters, it would be well within market expectations for a $2 billion to $8 billion charge, Joseph Dickerson, a bank analyst at Jefferies International Ltd, said in a note to clients.No clawbacksWhile the bank had about £9 billion of provisions for regulatory and legal matters on its balance sheet in September, analysts had said it probably needed more to cover residential mortgage-backed securities settlements and associated legal costs. The company is scheduled to report full-year earnings on 24 February.Drawing a line under the US investigations would clear a significant barrier for McEwan in his task to return RBS to profit and restore dividends. While he must also divest its Williams & Glyn consumer division, settling the probes could make it easier for the government to sell its majority stake in the lender. RBS is the last of 18 banks yet to settle Federal Housing Finance Agency accusations it sold faulty mortgage bonds to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from 2005 to 2007. The amount of securities subject to the FHFAs complaints can serve as a guide as to how much the Justice Department will seek in penalties, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. RBS sold $32.1 billion, more than Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse combined.The bank closed its US mortgage-backed securities trading and origination business in 2015 as part of McEwans plan to cut investment banking operations around the world in order to focus on consumer and commercial lending in the UK and Ireland. Although RBS cannot claw back compensation from staff at the unit because pay decisions at the time didnt include such restrictions, the CEO said the value of the banks bonus pool would fall in 2016 from a year ago.RBS is now a completely different business. Pay reflects the bank today and not 2007, McEwan said on the call with reporters. While since 2010 bonuses have fallen over 90 percent in the investment bank, that downward trajectory will continue when we announce pay decisions later this year. Bloomberg",2017-01-26,mBbtyHtQcGCSDCIPA1DR3O,"RBS has now taken £6.7 billion of provisions related to as many as 15 mortgage investigations and lawsuits, and said further charges may still be needed",15:02,RBS to take $3.8 billion charge tied to US mortgage probe

-0.02,"The seven-page minutes of the first meeting of the countrys maiden monetary policy committee (MPC) was replete with obvious statements, and bereft of details and analytics. The minutes gave a reproduction of the resolution of MPC and the vote of each member that was already in the public domain earlier this month.
				   
				The biggest hole in the minutes was the absence of detailed forecasts on growth, inflation and other metrics from each member. It also did not give any inkling of what the members think will happen over the next year or so. In sharp contrast are the detailed numerical forecasts given by the Federal Open Market Committee of the US Federal Reserve.Further, the MPC minutes state that extensive discussions took place on monetary policy (indeed it was a two-day meeting). There is no indication of what these discussions were. Which members felt growth is more important and who did not. Was there a debate and did any member acquiesce or accept a different opinion? Was Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Urjit Patel able to sway opinion? More importantly, what led to the unanimous vote for a rate cut in the end?To be fair, the minutes do have a detailed statement by each of the members and this was the only part that provides a glimpse into the mind of the committee.Reading through the statements provides a clear understanding of which members belong to either the hawk camp or the dove camp. The members who flagged the upside risks to inflation were governor Patel and RBI executive director Michael Patra. Both Ravindra Dholakia, professor at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, and Pami Dua, director at Delhi School of Economics, leaned heavily on the sputtering recovery in growth and the slack in the economy.Sample this from Patras statement. It is crucial, however, to step up vigil around the upturn in inflation projected in the last quarter of 2016-17 to guard against any risk to the target. The one from Patel reads: Therefore, while our model-based projections indicated upside risks to the target, a calibrated policy judgement was warranted, given that some space for policy action had opened up with the fall in inflation in the August reading. Nonetheless, inflation outcomes in Q4 will have to be carefully and continuously monitored as upside risks, albeit lower now than before, persist.This statement by Dholakia shows a clear leaning towards growth: Since there is substantial under-utilisation of capacity in the system, I do not see major risk to inflation if the output gap closes fast. Duas statement also plays the same beat. But in the absence of the data or the forecasts that backed these statements, it is futile to ponder what MPC would do next. Minutes such as these cannot achieve the objective of shaping market expectations.Do the minutes provide a better appreciation of the evolving monetary policy stance or even the issues involved? Do they provide the market with multiple perspectives of the members? The answer to these is a clear No.To be fair, MPC is in its infancy. As it conducts more meetings and evolves, hopefully the minutes too will evolve into a more nuanced and detailed version that answers many questions rather than leave a lot unsaid.

-0.55,"Mumbai: Indian banks received $30 billion of cash after the governments 8 November surprise move to abolish high-denomination banknotes, as customers queued for hours to deposit or exchange the old bills and ATMs ran dry.
				   
				With the banned bills accounting for 86% of money out of circulation, there is tremendous pressure on the nations banking system to replenish the cash. More than 70 million transactions were recorded through midday 12 November, the ministry of finance said in a statement late on Saturday. Theres adequate money in the currency chests at more than 4,000 locations and re-configuration of dispensing machines will be completed within two weeks, finance minister Arun Jaitley had said.Lenders have been caught out by Prime Minister Narendra Modis unexpected and widely-praised announcement of the withdrawal of Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes, part of a crackdown on tax evasion and the underground economy. Jaitley urged people not to rush to banks immediately and wait for a few days and to conduct financial transactions using electronic transfers, checks and credit and debit cards.A big regret is that people are getting inconvenienced, but currency replacement of this magnitude will cause some problems, Jaitley had said at a press conference in New Delhi on Saturday. There are long, but orderly queues. Such a big currency replacement cant be done overnight.The government will take more steps to curb tax evasion, including action against benami property, Modi said at an event in Goa on Sunday. Benami is property actually owned by someone but held in the name of a third party.State Bank of India, the countrys largest, got deposits worth Rs47,868 crore, Jaitley said. It handled Rs54,370 crore of cash transactions in all, including deposits, withdrawals and exchange of banknotes, starting Thursday through 12.15pm. on Saturday, Jaitley said. The government-owned lender and its associates account for about 20-25% of the nations banking system, he said.The government deliberately didnt reconfigure the more than 200,000 cash machines beforehand to help keep the announcement a secret, Jaitley said. The machines are being re-calibrated so that they can dispense new Rs500 and Rs2,000 notes, which do not fit into the existing cash trays in the ATMs.No mismanagementThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Sunday urged the public not to be anxious and avoid going to banks repeatedly to draw and hoard cash.The Reserve Bank assures members of the public that enough cash in small denominations is also available at the Reserve Bank and banks, the central bank said in its statement. Cash is available when they need it. The RBIs presses are printing banknotes at full capacity to ensure availability, it said on Saturday.The cash crisis has seen people standing for hours in long lines to exchange the now-defunct notes, and political rivals of Modis Bharatiya Janata Party relaying images of the chaos on social media.About 120,000 out of the 200,000 ATMs are operational, and presently only Rs100 notes are being disbursed from the machines, according to the finance ministrys statement on Saturday. To overcome cash-flow problems people are facing, the government allowed the use of old banknotes to pay court fees and utility bills until 14 November. It had earlier also suspended collection of tolls on national highways through the same period.The first few days are going to be a period of inconvenience, but long-term advantages of this are to the overall economy, said Jaitley. There is no mismanagement at banks.

0.44,"In May, a government of India Press Information Bureau release stated that the ministry of urban development had directed state governments to convert census towns to urban local bodies to allow for planned development and efficient service provision. Census towns are areas that are governed by village panchayats but are recognized by the census of India as being urban. This mismatch leads to a host of problemsfrom misallocation of resources to unsafe development of densely populated clusters. Much of India has long left her villages, and it is a welcome sign that the government is starting to acknowledge this. But the extent of urbanization in India is still widely underestimated. Urbanization has an important role to play in a countrys economic growth and so it is critical to get it right.
				   
				According to the 2011 census, there are 3,894 census towns spread across states. Maharashtra paid heed to the ministrys notice and recently granted urban local body status to 19 census towns in the Pune region.The ultimate decision to convert census towns to statutory urban local bodies rests with state governments. Municipal laws in some states specify guidelines such as population and density thresholds for notifying areas as urban local bodies, but these guidelines vary widely. For instance, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra have population thresholds of 30,000 and 25,000, respectively, for classifying an area as urban, whereas states such as Kerala and Punjab have no such criteria. Moreover, these guidelines are not binding and state governments can exercise discretion in notifying areas.An IDFC Institute paper by these authors along with Mudit Kapoor found that only 26% of India is governed by urban local bodies as of 2011. The rate varies across states with small hill states such as Mizoram (37%), Nagaland (26%) and Manipur (25%) surprisingly having a higher percentage of its population governed as urban than larger states such as West Bengal (23%), Bihar (11%) and Kerala (16%).Having differing and flexible guidelines makes sense given the heterogeneity across states. But differing guidelines are only meaningful if they are able to capture the true urban and rural characteristics of places across states. In our study cited, we found that this is not the case. At the state level, we found that the extent of areas governed as urban has a weak relationship with income, poverty and population working in non-agricultural activities, all of which are thought to be correlates of urbanization.In an opinion piece in this newspaper (Chasing definitions in India

), we argued that the official modes of recognizing urban areas in India underestimate the true extent of urbanization.Using the census definition, India is 31% urban. But we found that if we apply Ghanas definition of urban, India is 47% urban, and if we apply Mexicos definition, India is 65% urban. The differences in urbanization rates are even starker at a subnational level. For instance, Kerala is an anomaly and goes from being around 16% urban as per the administrative definition to over 99% urban using Ghanas and Mexicos definitions.Following the news of the central governments directive to convert census towns to urban local bodies, a national newspaper reported that the secretary of local self-government in Kerala, A.P.M. Mohammed Hanish, suggested that the minimum population threshold to upgrade areas to an urban status should be increased to 25,000a benchmark that is so high that no country uses it in its urban definition to the best of our knowledge. He stated, If the parameters prescribed by the Union ministry were strictly followed, there may not be any panchayat left in the state. This corresponds exactly to our findings of Kerala already being almost completely urban when we apply other definitions. It also emphasizes the reluctance of state governments to recognize that urbanization is a reality.This desire to stay rural may stem out of perceived advantages that are enjoyed by rural areas, such as access to funding through rural development schemes or lower taxes. However, these advantages may not necessarily exist. In our study, we investigated whether areas that are urban in nature but governed by panchayats make disproportionately more use of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, but found no evidence to support this conjecture. Thus, while staying rural may not confer the benefits some imagine they will receive, the real losers from the state governments actions are the de facto urban areas that are deprived of the benefits of planned development and amenities and services provided to officially urban settlements.India cannot afford to govern its settlements in such an arbitrary manner, and the ministry of urban developments move is one in a series of many steps required to address the lacunae in the current rural-urban categorization system, prevent misallocation of resources, provide efficient services and governance structures, and leverage the ongoing structural transformation to boost economic development.India is more urban than we think. Finally, policymakers are coming round to reckoning with this reality.Comments are welcome at

				Adjusted pretax profit was $458 million compared with a loss of $139 million a year earlier, the London-based lender said in a statement on Tuesday. That missed the $520 million average estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The stock dropped as much as 4.7%, the most since June.Chief executive officer Bill Winters is looking to show hes stemmed the banks losses and is on the way to restoring the dividend, after a sharp drop in revenue and surging loan impairments last year drove the Asia-focused lender to its first annual loss since 1989. In August, the bank said it would probably miss a future profitability target set only last year because of an uncertain regulatory and economic environment.The bank is becoming more efficient, but income and profit levels are not yet acceptable, Winters, 55, said in the statement. Standard Chartered said it expects the market environment to remain challenging.Revenue fell 5.9% to $3.47 billion. Corporate and institutional banking, its largest division, posted a 7.5% drop in revenue, while retail banking fell 1.1%.Restructuring costsStatutory pretax profit, which included $141 million of restructuring costs, fell 64% to $153 million in the third quarter. Operating expenses declined 4.5% from a year earlier to $2.39 billion, and the company said it remained on track to deliver more than $1 billion in cost cuts this year.The shares fell 3.8% to 684.9 pence at 8.54am in London. The stock has climbed 26% this year through Wednesdays close, the most among major European lenders. Standard Chartered and HSBC Holdings Plc, which both get most of their profit in Asia and report in dollars, have gained since Britain voted to leave the European Union, while other large UK lenders have declined. Even so, Standard Chartered still trades at about 40% less than its book value after plunging 39% in 2015.Losses on bad loans and other investments fell by more than half to $660 million in the quarter, according to the filing. That was more than the $612 million analysts had estimated. In 2015, impairments surged to a record $4 billion when the commodity market crashed and growth stalled from China to India.Standard Chartered said its common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of financial strength, fell to 13% from 13.1% at the end of the first half. That was less than the 13.3% analysts expected. The bank said its restructuring efforts should add 50 basis points to the measure in the fourth quarter, though other factors remain headwinds.Winters has been shrinking the balance sheet and tightening lending standards after taking over in 2015 for Peter Sands, who spent eight years in charge. Winters has replaced several senior executives and cracked down on ethics within the bank after discovering some employees were acting  above the law. He has also raised capital, suspended the dividend, cut 15,000 jobs and is restructuring or selling $100 billion of risky assets.The banks board is also deciding whether to sell its private-equity division to its managers, people familiar with the matter said last month. Winters is leaning toward spinning off the unit to reduce risk and has concerns over potential conflicts of interests that arise from being both an equity holder and a lender to companies, one of the people said.In August, the bank said it would likely take longer to reach its profitability goals. It had been aiming for an 8% return on equity by 2018, rising to 10% by 2020.Standard Chartered said on Tuesday that the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission intends to take action against the bank for its role in an initial public offering in the city in 2009.The bank is still under the scrutiny of an independent monitor as part of a 2012 deferred prosecution agreement, when it was fined $667 million for violating US sanctions by engaging in $250 billion in transactions with Iran.

				More than 58% of the top firms that have reported their financial results for the three months ended 31 December exceeded or met analysts estimates. A Mint analysis of 94 of the BSE500 companies shows that 55 have reported earnings that met or beat estimates. The ratio is little changed from the September quarter, when more than 58% of these firms met or beat estimates.Compared to pessimistic expectations and worries, the earnings have been a respite, said Gautam Chhaochharia, head of research at UBS Securities India Pvt. Ltd. The numbers suggest the impact of demonetisation was not that significant as earlier perceived. A surprise announcement by the government to withdraw high-denomination notes on 8 November hurt businesses across the country, with the consumer-centric ones being hit the hardest. While the currency swap has slowed the economy, analysts still expect economic growth clock one of the fastest rates this fiscal year.In the absence of a comparable event in the recent past, it was a difficult exercise for analysts to estimate the impact of demonetisation on earnings.ALSO READ | How demonetisation has impacted key sectorsIndias largest cement maker UltraTech Cement Ltd reported December quarter profit rose 5.13% from a year ago, meeting analysts estimates. Biotechnology firm Biocon Ltds profit rose a forecast-beating 65% to Rs171.3 crore in the quarter on the back of strong sales across segments. Indias largest cigarette maker ITC Ltd said profit grew 5.7% in December quarter, beating estimates, despite a challenging operating environment. The worst may not be behind them, analysts warn. There is no visibility of earnings recovery as yet in terms of capex cycle, policy support and the global environment, Chhaochharia said. Separately, an early bird Mint analysis of 243 of BSE500 companies that have announced their quarterly earnings so far and for which comparable data was available for at least 14 quarters showed that net sales and profit growth for these firms was the slowest in 10 quarters.  Banks, energy and technology firms were excluded from this study, as they follow a different earnings model. The study showed that net sales and profit for these 243 firms rose 0.59% and 7.76%, respectively, indicating demonetisation and the absence of a pick-up in capital expenditure and private investment weighed on operations. Operating profit for the companies contracted 2%, the first such decline in at least 10 quarters. ALSO READ | How much has demonetisation affected the stock market?The commodity prices are rising and eating into margins, and profits, which is why the contraction in operating profit, said Dhananjay Sinha, head of research at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. To be sure, many firms are still to announce their earnings for the quarter, and the picture could change when all the information is available. Sales growth is flat, and I think this trend will continue for a quarter or so. The budget will be critical and it is likely to be an expansionary budget with stimulus package to make up for demonetisation, added Sinha. Sinha pointed out that while things were good until October for consumer-centric firms, they were hit by demonetisation starting November. The positives from a good monsoon did not translate due to this and media companies were also hit by lower ad spends by FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) companies, said Sinha.",2017-01-30,nK2TwbHC7WkclrKbzEaplO,More than 58% of the top companies that have reported Q3 results exceeded or met analysts estimates,00:11,Demonetisation impact on Q3 earnings not as bad as feared

				Infosys cut its full-year dollar revenue forecast for the second time this fiscal, and now expects to grow between 8.2 and 9.2%, and 8-9% in constant currency terms.The sharp cut in FY17 USD revenue growth guidance, despite the recovery in growth momentum in 2QFY17, reflects a shift to a conservative approach on guidance after two successive cuts on the aggressive stance adopted at FY17-start, Pankaj Kapoor, director of India IT services and software equity research at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, wrote in a note. Chief executive officer Vishal Sikka said Infosys was scaling back its growth target because it had performed poorly in the first quarter and on account of near-term uncertainties.Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., which has most of its employees in India, has also cut its revenue growth forecast twice and expects to grow at 8.5-9.5% in 2016. Cognizant follows the calendar year. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Indias largest software services firm, does not give forecasts, but after it reported a poor 0.3% sequential dollar revenue growth on Thursday, it will be a tall task for the company to better the growth rate of 7.1% reported last fiscal year.Worryingly for both Infosys and TCS, it is not just sluggish revenue growth which is of concern. Both firms sounded less confident of maintaining profitability, with Infosys conceding that operating margin may be below its stated range of 25-26%.Infosyss sharp downward revision from the first growth outlook of between 11.8% and 13.8% dollar revenue expansion in April means that Infosys has shaved off $440 million in business from its first projection of adding $1.31 billion in incremental revenue this year. For Infosys, an at-best 9.2% growth means it expects to do $870 million in new business this year compared to $790 million last year.Infosys Ltd shares ended the day 2.53% lower at Rs1,025.70 on NSE even as the Nifty index rose 0.12% to 8,583.40 points.ALSO READ | Is Infosys being overly conservative with its guidance?Infosys said on Friday that revenue for the three months ended 30 September improved 3.5% to $2.58 billion from $2.5 billion in the preceding quarter. This was on account of the company partially recording $20 million in business from the Goods Services and Tax Network project, and a 4.5% growth in business from clients in banking and financial services segment.In constant currency terms, revenue grew 3.9% sequentially. Net profit rose 5.5% to $539 million from $511 million in the April-June period as the company deployed fewer people at expensive overseas client sites. A Bloomberg survey of analysts expected Infosys to report revenue of $2.58 billion and profit of $529.81 million in the September quarter.Operating margin expanded 80 basis points to 24.9% at the end of the September quarter, compared with 24.1% at the end of June. There are a couple of heartening takeaways in Infosyss performance during the second quarter, say analysts. First, a 4.6% sequential increase in business from banking clients suggests that Infosys may be winning customers at the expense of other large technology vendors.Second, Infosys reported over $1.2 billion in large deal wins during this quarter. This means that in little less than 18 months, Infosys has managed to increase its large deal wins from a little over $400 million a quarter to $1.2 billion.Analysts at Citibank said in a note after Infosys declared its earnings that fairly all-round growth in key geographies and verticalsbetter than what peer TCS reported is another positive for the company. The US business, which brings 61.5% of Infosyss revenue, improved 2.6% sequentially, while business from India, which accounts for 3.4% of overall revenue, jumped 29.1%.The company added 78 new clients in the second quarter, taking the total number of customers to 1,136.

-0.2,"Seoul: The long-orchestrated plan to cement Jay Y. Lees position atop Samsung Group may put him in jail instead, raising questions about who would step in to run South Koreas biggest conglomerate in the aftermath.
				   
				Prosecutors are seeking Lees arrest on allegations including bribery and embezzlement, which if proven could prompt him to relinquish duties at the family business. Potential replacements include executives running key divisions of the dominant electronics business, as well as a sisterhotel executive Lee Boo-jin. While a long shot, her anointment would mark a seismic shift in the way the nations patriarchal empires are run.After spending years following his fathers footsteps to the chairmans seat of Samsung Group, Lee is trying now to avoid the missteps that triggered his fathers two criminal convictions. Even if the accusations against him involving South Koreas president are proven in court, its still possible Lee could return to the company later or even call the shots from behind bars, just as executives from Hyundai Motor Co. and SK Group have done.Chaebol executives have a history of managing from the jail, whether it be via lawyers or secretaries visiting them, said Lee Kyung-mook, a professor at Seoul National Universitys Graduate School of Business.Samsung declined to comment when asked about a potential leadership vacuum. A court hearing is scheduled for Wednesday to determine whether to approve the prosecutors request for an arrest warrant. Whether the warrant is granted or not, prosecutors would continue their probe with a possible indictment coming later.Lees potential arrest in the scandal surrounding President Park Geun-hye is another calamity for the vice chairman of Samsung Electronics Co., the largest maker of mobile devices. Last year, the company pulled its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone off the shelves because some devices burst into flames. The debacle cost Suwon-based Samsung an estimated $6 billion and a competitive advantage before Apple Inc. released its iPhone 7 models.Lee, 48, has had trouble matching the success of his father, Lee Kun-hee, who transformed Samsung Electronics from a copycat appliance maker into a global powerhouse in TVs, smartphones and memory chips. The elder LeeSouth Koreas richest mansuffered a crippling heart attack in May 2014, and Samsung shares fell that year and the next before recovering in 2016.Its a perilous practice that a person can take over a company just because he or she was born to a successful father, opposition lawmaker Park Yong-jin said. The biggest problem with our economy is that people with unproven skills run its biggest companies.Lee doesnt play the role of day-to-day manager, depending rather on co-CEOs and other top managers to handle those responsibilities. But employees and shareholders depend on him to provide strategic guidance when it comes to decisions like the next big bets in technology or potential acquisitions.After the elder Lees collapse, executives including J.K. Shin, who is in charge of the smartphone division, handled daily operations for Samsung Electronics.The son became de facto leader of the group, which then embarked on an intricate reorganization to solidify his control. Prosecutors want to know if that effort involved making payments to a presidential confidante in exchange for government support.If Lee is imprisoned, he could be replaced by Samsung Electronics co-chief executive officer Kwon Oh-hyun, a 64-year-old who leads the semiconductor and display businesses. The successes of those two divisions helped propel Samsung to its best operating profit in three years during the quarter ended 31 December.Another candidate is Yoon Boo-keun, who heads the consumer-electronics unit encompassing TVs and appliances.Hes part of the trio with Lee and Kwon that has run Samsung Electronics, said Park Ju-gun, president of Seoul-based corporate watchdog CEOSCORE. Samsung could be run as if that trio were still intact.It also would be natural for Lee Kun-hees eldest daughter to be considered, said Chung Sun-sup, who runs corporate researcher Chaebul.com.Lee Boo-jin, 46, is CEO of the luxury Hotel Shilla Co. chain, which is on track to post revenue growth for a sixth straight year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. She owns 5.5% of Samsung C&T Corp., one of the biggest shareholders in Samsung Electronics.Some speculate she could practically take over, but being a large shareholder doesnt mean she could run a massive company like Samsung Electronics, Chung said. Realistically speaking, Kwon may be the one.Lee Kyung-mook, the Seoul National University professor, also identified her as a candidate to manage the conglomerate, albeit temporarily.A daughter taking over Samsung would break with tradition in South Korea, where sons succeed fathers at the chaebol that dominate the economy. Still, Samsung has been a trailblazer in doing away with old business practices and hiring women aggressively.Lees sister may briefly take the reins, but theres little chance shed take over permanently given she has fewer shares in the firm than her brother, the professor said.The youngest surviving daughter, Lee Seo-hyun, is an executive at Samsung C&T.In the meantime, Jay Y. Lee may miss the window of opportunity to succeed his father as parliament moves to make it harder for Samsung to use its own shares to help him consolidate control, said Heo Pil-seok, CEO at Midas International Asset Management in Seoul. That could make the stock more volatile.Park, the lawmaker, submitted a bill nicknamed the Jay Y. Lee Law to prevent financial firms from supporting the types of internal mergers orchestrated to help Lee boost control.The corporate governance at Samsung could remain awkward for an extended period of time, and that would increase uncertainties, Heo said.The elder Lee faced his own scandalsa 1996 conviction for bribing a former president and a 2008 conviction for embezzlement and tax evasion. Both times, he was pardoned.That history may work against his children, and Jay Y. Lee acknowledged publicly that someone else may take over the collection of about 60 divisions whose combined revenues equal about one-fifth of South Koreas gross domestic product.

Russias largest oil producer is following a strategy by resource-rich firms and nations to secure outlets for their output, and may supply the facility with Venezuela crude and challenge Middle East exporters that provide about two-thirds of the countrys imports.India will be the most important product-growth market over the next 25 years, making it important to Russia, according to Neil Beveridge, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.With the Essar deal, Rosneft is targeting a market of 1.3 billion people that imports more than 80% of its crude requirements and which is forecast by the International Energy Agency to be the worlds fastest-growing oil consuming nation through 2040. The country has emerged as a bright spot for global demand as the quickest economic expansion among major economies spurs increased use of trucks, cars and motorbikes.Market accessThe transaction also includes about 2,700 Essar Oil retail stations, a market that has attracted top oil companies such Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc. Most of Essars output is sold domestically, either through its own outlets or to government-owned fuel retailers.The access to the Indian market attracted Rosneft the most, Prashant Ruia, chairman of Essar Oil, said in an interview in Mumbai on Sunday. It is one of the worlds largest markets. They wanted to have a piece of the market.Also read: Engineers India, Gazprom to prepare India-Russia gas pipeline blueprintRosneft also sees the potential to expand in the Asia-Pacific region by supplying fuels to Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Australia, it said in a statement.The deal will enable Russia to have greater influence over the Asian market, said Abhishek Kumar, an analyst at InterfaxEnergys Global Gas Analytics in London. This would be in response to Saudi Arabias attempts to penetrate the European market, which is dominated by Russian oil.Venezuelan crudeThe need for oil-rich nations to invest in overseas refineries to secure market share has intensified amid a global glut. Saudi Arabia is buying stakes in refiners through its state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco in countries from Indonesia to the US. Kuwait is also investing in processing facilities.Essar Oils Vadinar refinery in Gujarat can process about 400,000 barrels a day. It was designed to run on low-quality crudes from Venezuelan or the Middle East, rather than Russian grades. Venezuela made up almost half the refinerys supplies in the first six months of the year, followed by Iran, according to shipping data obtained by Bloomberg.The best way for Rosneft to supply crude to Essar is via its equity in Venezuela, said Tushar Tarun Bansal, director at Ivy Global Energy, an industry consultant in Singapore. Bringing this crude to India helps Rosneft and Russia the most by securing their equity crude supply and not adversely impacting its own market in Europe.By comparison, Middle East exporters led by Iraq and Saudi Arabia provided more than 65% of Indias overall crude imports during the April-June quarter, according to oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan.Strategic dealsRosneft and Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the state oil company, agreed earlier this year to terms on swapping crude oil and fuels. The Russian oil giant also has interests in five projects in VenezuelaPetromonagas, Petrovictoria, Petromiranda, Boqueron and Petroperijathat contain estimated oil reserves that exceed 20.5 billion tonnes (about 150 billion barrels), the company said in February.India has been deepening its energy ties with Russia, which has also developed nuclear reactors in the South Asian nation and has discussed increasing supplies of natural gas through both LNG and pipelines. Indian state-owned companies have so far spent almost $6 billion for new stakes in Russian oil assets in Siberia.After letting India companies invest in Russian exploration and production projects, India is reciprocating by allowing Russian oil major Rosneft to invest in refining in India, said Bernsteins Beveridge. These agreements are very strategic, aimed at boosting Indias energy security and boosting Russias access to the most important long term growth market. Bloomberg",2016-10-17,oMDuiVNGQqQXrS5QCOYSKM,"With the Essar Oil deal, Rosneft is targeting the Indian market which is forecast to be the worlds fastest-growing oil consuming nation through 2040",12:27,Rosnefts Essar Oil deal takes Russias turf war to Middle East backyard
0.65,"Beijing: India has become an action zone for Chinas big-time investors like e-commerce giant Alibaba as its market attracted second highest Chinese funding in IT products next to the US, state media reported on Thursday. 
				   
				Citing the fast growth of Indias e-commerce website Paytm which provides services to 130 million people in India, a write-up in state-run China Daily said, India is not just another developing countryit is the worlds fastest-growing economy. A huge internet population, rapid growth of mobile internet users, political stability, established institutions like judiciary, a thriving start-up ecosystem, renowned IT expertise and the promising market potential... all these factors have made India an attractive, almost irresistible proposition for Chinese investors, the report said. Apart from Ant Financial, Chinas internet giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings Ltd have already invested in Indian tech companies, it said. Smaller players and even start-ups in China are rushing to India as they see the country as the next frontier in internet-based businesses and a promising market for them to replicate Chinese tech giants success stories, it said. While the Chinese investors look to flock to India to cash on the fast growing e-commerce market, there are also anxieties among Chinese investors over growing calls for boycott of Chinese goods in India following Chinas blocking of Indias move to ban Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) chief Masood Azhar at the UN and blocking Indias bid to become the member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG). Chinese officials said Chinas investment in India currently touched about $3 billion, which Indian officials said not much compared to the potential. Quoting a report from itjuzi.com, a website dedicated to data on tech investments, the report said India has emerged as one of the most popular destinations for Chinese tech investors, second only to the US. In the first half of 2016, Chinese internet giants and venture capital firms invested more than 42.1 billion yuan ($6.26 billion) in 60 tech-related projects overseas, including 10 in India and 33 in the US. India will be the next big internet market after China, said Eric Shu, a senior partner with the Hangzhou-based venture capital firm InCapital. We believe many successful business models in Chinas internet industry can be copied in India, Shu said, adding that as Chinas economic growth slows, Chinese investors are looking for opportunities abroad. A recent report from Forrester Research Inc. said metropolitan cities in India and China are progressive pioneers that lead the demand for product and experience innovation in the Asia-Pacific region. The Indian market is similar to that of Chinas in many respects. Li Tao, chief executive officer (CEO) of the Beijing-based Apus Group which provides launchers, browsers and other apps for mobile phones running on the Android operating system, said Indias mobile internet market is at a stage where Chinas was three to five years ago. Unlike people in the US and China who gradually made the transition from using personal computers to access the internet to using mobile devices for the purpose, Indians do not need to go through the process. They can directly jump into the era of mobile internet, he said. Founded in 2014, Apus Group expects to have 80 million users in India by the year-end. The company set up a venture capital fund in late 2015 with its partners. With an initial investment of three billion rupees ($45 million), the fund focuses on investing in Indian mobile internet startups. For investors such as Apus, India is unique in the sense that millions of Indians already use smartphones for online shopping, communications, banking, news, entertainment, ticketing, bill payments, education, so on, the report said. The aggressive expansion of Chinese smartphone makers in India has been fuelling the trend. Chinese firms sell affordable handsets in India that are popular among millions of consumers, the report said. The promising future aside, Indias poor finance infrastructure and the low per-capita income make it difficult to earn good returns on investment in the near term, said industry insiders. There are several business models for apps to make profit. But Indian netizens are not ready to pay for services yet. For now, the only practical way for internet business in India to make money is to sell online advertisements, Zhang Lei, CEO of YeeCall, a Beijing-based startup that offers an instant messaging app in India said.PTI",2016-10-20,oOAvbBXRJ5fzPyHGJEETsJ,"Smaller players and even start-ups in China are rushing to India as they see the country as the next frontier in internet-based businesses, says state-run China Daily ",14:32,India new active zone for Chinese IT investors after US: China Daily
0.4,"New Delhi: As part of a strategy to reduce its electricity bills, Indian Railways plans to award tenders worth around Rs8,000 crore to set up a dedicated electricity transmission network.
				   
				The national transporter, which announced a Rs41,000 crore cost-saving exercise earlier this week, will award six tenders. Four transmission links will be set up through the public-private partnership route, and two by Indian Railways itself.The transmission play by Indias largest electricity consumer comes in the backdrop of Indian Railways buying  electricity directly from suppliers of its choice rather than state electricity boards (SEBs). It also has a 1,000-megawatt captive power plant at Nabinagar, Bihar.We plan to set up a country-wide electricity transmission network, said a railway ministry official on condition of anonymity.For starters, these transmission links will be between Mughal Sarai-Howrah; Delhi-Chennai; Delhi-Mumbai; Mumbai-Howrah; Chennai-Mumbai; and Chennai-Howrah.ALSO READ | Railways plans Rs1.3 trillion capital expenditure in 2017-18Indian Railways has been buying electricity directly from suppliers after being allowed to do so by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC), Indias apex power sector regulator (Bihar and West Bengal have challenged the CERCs order in the appellate tribunal for electricity). However, it is still dependent on state transmission networks to transmit electricity. Major international railway networks have their own electricity transmission network. This is primarily driven by the need for reliability and the unique electricity load requirement for  railways. The need gets much more pressing given our growing focus on improving the speed of trains, said the rail ministry official cited above.Indian Railways needs a so-called shifting load as a locomotive moves from one point to the other. An increase in speed will help the carrier reduce congestion on its networks, which in turn will help improve its revenue from freight and passenger traffic.ALSO READ | Sharp decline in bank loans to infrastructure sectorAshwani Kapoor, member, traction, Railway Board, confirmed the development and said the railways had moved the first tender for a transmission link between Mughal Sarai and Howrah.In 2014-15, the total energy cost of Indian Railways was Rs31,220 crore. This included expenditure of Rs10,436 crore towards electric traction, which carries about two thirds of the total freight, and about 50% of passenger traffic and Rs2,199 crore for non-traction usage such as manufacturing units, workshops and station areas.The bids will be awarded on the framework already developed and adopted by Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. Each tender will have an order value of around Rs500-1,000 crore and will have a two-stage bid process comprising a qualification stage and a price-bid stage, said the rail ministry official.Experts say a dedicated transmission system will allow Indian Railways more flexibility and independence in its electricity load management.For railways it will make sense. Electricity is a big spend. But while this  will help the railways, it also showcases the failure of implementation of open access policy in the right spirit, said Abhishek Poddar, partner and head, energy and process industries, AT Kearney India.Railway minister Suresh Prabhu on Tuesday unveiled a plan to save Rs41,000 crore over 10 years through an integrated energy management system. According to Indian Railways Mission 41k initiative, the national carrier will electrify 24,000km of rail tracks over the next five years by doubling the annual rate of electrification from 2,000km to 4,000km in the next two years.",2017-01-20,oPevMOSW11AFthQszUuwaP,"Four transmission links will be set up through the PPP route, and two by Indian Railways, as part of a strategy to reduce electricity bills",01:35,"Railways to float Rs8,000 crore tenders for transmission network"
0.01,"Mumbai/New Delhi: Global oil majors BP Plc and Rosneft PJSC are eyeing a piece of Indias $117 billion retail market for fossil fuels, threatening to shake up government-owned companies that have faced little competition for a decade.
				   
				BP has already secured licenses to open as many as 3,500 fuel stations in the worlds second most-populous nation. Rosneft gained access to about 2,700 pumps through last months acquisition of Essar Oil Ltd, which has plans to add 2,600 more outlets. Along with Reliance Industries Ltd and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, the private players will try to chip away at the dominant position of three state-owned enterprises that control 90% of market volume.Competition is expected to intensify with the entry and expansion of private players and multinational companies, said Rahul Prithiani, a Mumbai-based director at CRISIL, a unit of S&P Global Ratings. Private players and multinational companies are expected to increase their market share though government companies will probably still dominate given their vast network of fuel retailing stations, he said.Retail sales have become more viable for private-sector refiners ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modis government scrapped diesel-price controls two years ago. Pricing freedom coupled with record oil consumption as the number of trucks, cars and motorbikes multiply is helping India stand out as a country that global oil majors cant ignore.The Paris-based International Energy Agency predicts India will be the worlds fastest-growing oil consuming nation through 2040.This sort of growth they will not get anywhere, said Lalit Kumar Gupta, chief executive officer of Essar Oil. Europe is virtually saturated, there is hardly any growth. In the US there is tough competition. India is the only country which is growing and which is growing by a big number and they feel there is scope.Companies including Saudi Aramco and Frances Total SA have shown an interest in India, while existing players such as Shell are planning to expand their footprint, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said in June, flagging further reforms in the oil and gas sector. More fuel retailers will increase competition and benefit consumers, he said.This is Indias second attempt at deregulation. Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries had captured 14% of retail diesel sales and 7% of petrol sales in 2006, after the government deregulated prices more than a decade back. The company had to close down pumps after price caps were re-introduced.The October 2014 deregulation is an opportunity for Reliance Industries to re-enter the retail market and ramp up volumes, according to the companys latest annual report. RIL plans to launch aggressive customer acquisition programs to quickly regain targeted market share, it said.Reliance Industries has re-secured over 4.5% of sales to bulk users of diesel, such as railways and state-operated bus services, the company said. It has opened about 1,100 stations so far, with plans to increase the number to 1,400 by March.Rising consumptionIndias fuel demand grew 11%in the year ended 31 March, the fastest pace in records going back to fiscal 2001. Consumption expanded 8% in the first half of the financial year that started 1 April, according to the oil ministrys Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell.BP sees a strong future for transportation fuels in India, the British oil major said in an emailed statement last week. We are keen to be involved in this market and contribute to its development.Still, private players have a long battle on their hands given the dominating position of the three government-owned companies, Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd, which together operate almost 53,000 fuel stations in India.If we compare with 10 years ago when private players had come, since then the state-run oil marketing companies are much better prepared, said Sanjiv Singh, head of refineries at Indian Oil, the countrys biggest fuel retailer. It will definitely bring in efficiency. The challenge before us is that while private players target the very-prime market, our commitment is to feed the total market.International companies may first make a dent in the large-scale industrial and commercial market, since public-sector companies have established themselves at prime locations for fuel pumps, Vikas Halan, vice president at Moodys Investors Service, said by phone.Thats where the competition heats up with the foreign players, he said.

				A subsidised 14.2-kg cylinder will now cost Rs430.64 in Delhi as against Rs428.59 previously, according to state-owned oil firms. Also, the aviation turbine fuel (ATF) price was hiked 7.33%, or Rs3,434.25 per kilolitre (kl), to Rs50,260.63 per kl in Delhi. This is the second straight increase in rates, coming on the back of 3.11% rise in 1 October. In case of subsidised LPG, this is the sixth increase in price since July when the government decided to go in for a small hikes of up to Rs 2 per bottle every month to cut down its subsidy outgo. LPG rates were last hiked on 28 October by Rs1.5 per cylinder on account of hike in commission paid to dealers. In the last monthly hike, rates went up by Rs2.03 per cylinder on 1 October to Rs427.09. Prior to that rates were hiked by Rs1.97 per cylinder on 1 September, Rs1.93 on 16 August and by Rs1.98 per 14.2-kg cylinder on 1 July. The government had earlier this month decided to take the diesel route for eliminating subsidies on LPG and kerosene. Diesel price was deregulated in November 2014 after the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government effected 50 paise hikes every month to eliminate subsidies. The near Rs2 per cylinder hike in LPG every month is also aimed at doing the same thing. In case of kerosene, the government has allowed state-owned oil companies to raise the price by 25 paise a litre every fortnight for 10 months. The 8th hike in kerosene, since July, was effected on Tuesday. A litre of kerosene now costs Rs17.17 in Mumbai. Delhi has been declared a kerosene-free state and no subsidised PDS kerosene is sold in the national capital. The price of non-subsidised LPG, which consumers buy after exhausting their quota of 12 bottles of 14.2-kg each per household in a year, was hiked by Rs37.5 to Rs529.5.

0.78,"Shares of housing finance companies (HFC), especially the mid-sized, have given phenomenal returns to investors over the past one year.
				   
				 And why not? These companies have shown stellar growth in their businesses. Most of the nine listed HFCs, excluding behemoth Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd, have expanded assets under management by at least 30% and maintained impeccable asset quality over the last one year.It is in this sweet spot that PNB Housing Finance will become the 10th HFC to list on the stock exchanges on Tuesday.PNB Housing Finance, too, is a mid-sized home lender in expansion mode, having grown its loan book at a compound annual growth rate of 62% over the past four years.The lenders asset quality is enviable with bad loans a minuscule 0.29% of the total loan book on a gross basis as of the June quarter. That Quality Investment Holdings (a Carlyle group firm) owns 49% in the HFC has alleviated concerns over governance that investors typically tend to raise in the case of a public sector parentage. Given the deep housing deficit in India that throws open an opportunity to home lenders, HFCs will continue to catch the fancy of investors.Home loans are considered the safest products that have the lowest delinquency ratios. It is no surprise that most analysts have recommended buying into the lenders initial public offering (IPO).But, is the price the lender is asking from investors reasonable?At the price band of Rs750-775 set for the IPO, the HFC has valued itself around Rs12,800 crore. At the upper end of the price band, the stocks post-issue valuation would be 2.4 times the book value of 2015-16.It will depend on the comparison as valuations of HFCs are all over the place. Compare the lender with Can Fin Homes Ltd or Gruh Finance Ltd, and PNB Housing Finance looks like a steal.Can Fin Homes is trading at 5.5 times its FY16 book value while Gruh Finance is the most expensive, trading at nearly 15 times its FY16 book value.But Dewan Housing Finance Ltd is trading at twice its book value, which makes PNB Housing Finance seem a tad expensive.Religare Securities notes this and adds a note of caution that PNB Housing Finance is unlikely to show growth similar to the pace of the past five years.Further, the lenders construction finance loans grew the fastest and 18% of its loan book comprises loan against property.

				The entire episode is a classic home ground for myriad litigation, said Sumit Agrawal, partner at law firm Suvan Law Advisors and a former official with markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).There could also be a class action suit, suit for damages, defamation as well as a public interest litigation, said Agrawal.ALSO READ | Cyrus Mistry fires first salvo in legal battle against TataThe fight in the courts could very well start with questioning Mistrys unceremonious removal as chairman of Tata Sons. According to the holding firms articles of association, a selection committee is needed to both select and replace a chairman. However, the Tatas have said they had sought legal opinion before replacing him, and it isnt clear why Mistry has not pursued this option so far.If relevant, the breach of any contractual shareholder rights may also be alleged in terms of the shareholders agreement at the Tata Sons level. Whether the parties approach arbitration or the courts will also be dependent upon the terms of the said agreement, said Tejesh Chitlangi, partner at law firm IC Legal.Pursuing the corporate governance angle, Mistry could complain to Sebi about these issues, especially the possible violation of the need-to-know principle under securities regulations.Many of allegations in the public domain against Tata Sons pertain to financial irregularities and insider trading for which Mistry can approach CBI, Sebi. According to his statements, the end goal is to achieve better governance practices, so such investigations could lead to short term pain; however, down the line, there would be cleaner processes, said Shriram Subramanian, founder of proxy advisory firm, InGovern.Yet another option is to approach the government. At the heart of the governance reform,  which Mistry wants to institute, lies the relationship of the Tata Trusts with the group operating companies. He has said the government has an inherent obligation to remedy and repair (the) breakdown in the governance of Tata Trusts.In his Monday message, Mistry talked about how the trustees wielded no voting power on Tata Sons shares until 15 years ago, because company law had vested it in the hands of the government.The role of MCA (ministry of corporate affairs) in administering The Companies Act, 2013, and of the ministry of finance in seeking the stand of Sebi and stock exchanges is also involved, since the episode has international ramifications of Indias rankings for business environment, Agrawal of Suvan added.Mistry could present these issues of corporate governance and ethics to institutional investors and ask them to raise questions with the Tatas.We have brought the dialogue on the table, both from the point of view of governance and ethics, and I think that is today in peoples minds. I believe you will see shareholders in the near future demanding (better) governance, Mistry said in an interview on Monday.I also think that the institutional investors should write to Tata Sons seeking that what is their succession plan, because from where we stand, it seems to be completely unclear, said Subramanian of InGovern.Lastly, Mistry and his family can buy shares of the Tata group operating companies from the open market, if he thinks that will best serve his interests as a shareholder in the group.

The economy, however, has received a substantial boost thanks to the higher deficit.Ratio of forex reserves to external debt hits a high Indias foreign exchange reserves-to-external debt ratio rose to a 3.5-year high of 75.2% by end-June 2016, Religare Institutional Research said in a note to clients. The countrys external debt fell slightly to $479.7 billion in the quarter ended June, on the back of a consistent decline in commercial borrowings. However, according to Religare, since the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) added nearly $80-90 billion to forex reserves over the last three years, Indias external position remains benign versus other emerging market peers.The upshot: India has sufficient forex reserves to weather external shocks. US cuts anti-dumping duty on shrimps from India The US department of commerces decision to roll back the hike in anti-dumping duty on import of frozen shrimps from India is likely to benefit farmers and would be revenue-neutral for processors, rating agency Icra Ltd said.In its final review in September, the commerce department fixed the final average duty at 2.2%. The US, which consumed 123,114 tonnes of frozen Indian shrimps in fiscal year 2016, remains the largest export market for the seafood from India. In value terms, it is about Rs7,435 crore.

				Whats striking about the data is that this represents a year-on-year growth of just 0.3%, suggesting growth in inflows from IT have practically dried up. As the chart alongside shows, growth has come off substantially compared to pre-crisis levels, when growth rates averaged over 30%.But it must be noted that the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBIs) data shows FY16 gross inflows from computer services of around $74 billion, while Nasscom puts the industrys revenues at $108 billion in the year till March 2016. Besides, while Nasscom estimated FY16 growth at 10.3% in dollar terms, RBI data puts growth in inflows at merely 1.4%. Growth in gross inflows, of course, need not be the same as growth in IT sector export revenues.Having said that, its true that growth rates of IT exports have come down substantially, as is evidenced in the September quarter results of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd. Indias IT industry is set to grow in single digits this fiscal year, its weakest performance since the global financial crisis. Based on TCS and Infosyss comments, growth is likely to be in the 7-8% range. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a recent note to clients, At present, Indian IT Industry faces three broad headwinds: (1) weak IT spends in financial services and healthcare verticals coupled with rise in insourcing or expansion of captives by select financial services clients, (2) deflationary impact of automation on revenue. Automation savings built in large deals/renewals puts downward pressure on revenues; downward pressure on contract values has been an ongoing pattern but has accelerated in the past 12-18 months, and (3) lack of adequate participation in digital.

				Despite this, the Mumbai-based microfinancier will see a 200 basis point drop in its funding costs, as it moves away from a funding mix dominated by bank borrowing, said a top executive.The cost of funds for most microfinance companies varies between 10% and 12%. Because of pricing benefits, raising term deposits will not be a challenge for us. We will offer 100-150 basis points more on deposits than what commercial banks are offering as we believe that competition is not intense in this segment, said R. Baskar Babu, chief executive of Suryoday.Raising term deposits will be crucial for microfinance-turned-small finance banks in order to cut overall costs. In order to increase the deposit base, small finance banks will offer more attractive rates on the deposit side.Suryoday plans to focus on smaller term deposits of between Rs50,000 and Rs1 lakh and will offer depositors close to 9% interest rate for a one-year term deposit. By comparison, Equitas Small Finance Bank is offering 8.5% on one-year term deposits.Abizer Diwanji, partner and national leader, financial services and restructuring services at EY India, said: It is reasonable enough for these microfinance-turned-small finance banks to offer higher interest rates on deposits during the initial years. Suryoday currently borrows 55% from banks, 13.8% from non-banking financial companies and raises the rest through non-convertible debentures, subordinate debt and securitization, according their annual report 2015-16.We will hire 500 employees from non-financial background like hotels, restaurants once we convert all our bank branches, said Babu.In the microfinance business when a customer borrows money, it is not easy to ascertain if the amount borrowed by the customer is for income generation or for private consumption.Once the microfinance customer starts depositing money with us, lot of analytics can be inferred out looking at what quantum and at what frequency is the person saving. We plan to divert our 20-25% portfolio in non-microfinance business, one year from now, said Babu.

-0.3,"The December quarter results of Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T), a proxy for the state of Indias investment demand, was disappointing. It was all the more so, as it had turned in a vibrant performance for the September quarter. What is likely to dampen investor sentiment is the managements decision to lower growth guidance to 8-10% for the full year ending March, from the earlier forecast of 12-15%. And even that appears to be an uphill task for the juggernaut.
				   
				The firms December quarter results surprised the Street negatively. Net revenue grew 1.4% to Rs26,287 crore from a year ago, which fell short of Bloombergs average estimate by a significant 11%. One could blame it on demonetisation, to some extent.The impact was felt the most in the infrastructure segment, which comprises over three-fourths of L&Ts revenue. The management said in its media release that clearance delays and the abrupt liquidity crunch at the customers end hindered work progress.Meanwhile, toll revenue was down, too. So were real estate sales. Yet, the segments revenue grew by 6%, with a robust contribution from its international projects.Thats not all. L&Ts power segment is battling a dwindling order book. Revenue fell by 23% year-on-year (y-o-y). Also, the other smaller engineering segments and information technology (IT) did little to enthuse investors.But L&Ts 9.6% operating margin matched investor expectation and was a neat 140 basis points (bps) higher than the year-ago period. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Stringent working capital management and cost-cutting exercises did the trick. In this respect, the infrastructure segment delivered a respectable 110 bps y-o-y rise, even as the hydrocarbons, heavy engineering and electrical and automation segments pulled up their socks.However, both operating profit and net profit fell short of the average brokerage estimates. Yet, the consolidated net profit was about 39% higher y-o-y at Rs972.5 crore, not a bad deal considering the macroeconomic challenges.The moot question is, will L&T meet its guided revenue and order inflow target?On the revenue front, the firm will have to ramp up execution in the fourth quarter to match even the watered down 10% growth in annual revenue. Thanks to customer delays after the currency ban, the work at many sites was almost at a standstill. These have to gain traction again. Meanwhile, segments such as IT could clock slower revenue growth.On order inflows, the challenge is no less. December-quarter order inflow was 10% lower, with a third coming in from overseas. Again, given its run-rate at the end of nine months, the firm has to clock at least Rs50-60,000 crore to meet the guided annual target. Not impossible, given that the fourth quarter is the lumpiest on order inflows, but a Herculean task, too.In fact, L&Ts results convey that all is not well in the economy.Domestic growth appears to take a longer time as investment momentum is weak and the banking system is burdened with a debt overhang, says the company's media release, adding that the challenging business conditions are likely to remain for a few more quarters.Infrastructure orders from the government are still delayed and private capex is yet to take off.L&Ts stock trades at Rs1,439 apiece, which discounts its one-year forward estimated earnings by a rich 21 times.In fact, since demonetisation, the stock, which has been a steady outperformer, has been volatile. Brokerages have trimmed both the expected earnings and valuations over the past few weeks.

0.25,"Bengaluru: Indias largest biscuit maker Britannia Industries Ltds new financial chief N. Venkataraman has his work cut out for him when he takes over from outgoing chief financial officer (CFO) Amlan Datta Majumdar next month.
				   
				For starters, the companys managing director Varun Berry wants him to find new ways to cut costs. That wont be easy as Britannia has already trimmed its fat in a big way since Berry took charge three years ago.When you start on a cost-efficiency programme, initially it will always be the low-hanging fruits that you aim for, said Amnish Aggarwal, senior vice-president, research, Prabhudas Lilladher. As you go on, it becomes more and more difficult to cut costs.But Berry is confident the cost accountant, who has been with Britannia since 2007 and is currently in charge of the finances of its bakery business, can do it.Over the last three years, he has led the critical cost efficiency and productivity enhancement programmes in the company which has resulted in significant and consistent improvement in business margins, Berry said in an email.Berrys desire to introduce more cost savings is understandable: He wants to plough more money into new products or categories without disrupting margins amid high raw material costs. The inflation rate for all key ingredientsflour, sugar and palm oilwere in the double-digits in the second quarter, the company said. So what should Venkataraman do?Some analysts advised him to focus on cutting freight costs, while others urged him to take a hard look at the inefficiencies in the supply chain.I think there are two three areas. One very clearly will be, with the GST coming in, one has to think very creatively on how to maximize that, said Harminder Sahni, a retail consultant and managing director of Wazir Advisors.The second thing is relationships with vendors and suppliers are not looked at as critically because at (legacy companies like Britannia) those old relationships are always there. But with the company growing now, they need to look at that very hard. On Wednesday, Berry reiterated on a post-earnings conference call that the cost efficiency programme is critical.We have accelerated it over the last four years and we would like to make sure that we get this to an even higher level, said Berry, who is looking at almost Rs.170 crore of cost savings this year.So is this aggressive cost control stance that makes it harder for Britannias financial chiefs to stay in the job? That is not easy to determine, but clearly some are taking note, so much so that an analyst asked Berry why the firm has seen three CFO resignations in the past 4-5 years.The danger of a company like ours which is a completely Indian company with operations only in India is that sometimes there are aspirations which are beyond being CFO of an Indian company. Those aspirations will always remain in peoples minds, Berry explained.However, Majumdar told Mint that he was leaving for personal reasons, adding it was time he used his experience to do something new and different.",2016-11-10,p1koqcqdvavhtI8RlD1ZaN,New Britannia CFO N.

-0.03,"Mumbai: Kshitij Venture Capital Fund, set up in 2005 with a tenure of seven years, which was extended by two years to June 2014, is still to return money to investors, two people aware of the matter said.
				   
				The fund is run by Kshitij Investment Advisory Co. Ltd, a unit of India-focused private equity firm Everstone Capital Ltd.Everstone inherited the fund from its erstwhile joint venture partner Kishore Biyani in 2009 when the two parted ways. The fund was set up by Biyani to invest in realty projects across India before Everstone co-founder and managing partner Sameer Sain joined the board of Biyanis company.The rupee fund had raised Rs350 crore from 40-50 investors with a minimum contribution of Rs5 crore each.After more than 11 years since the fund was raised, Everstone has been able to return only Rs232 crore to its investors, compared to the Rs350 crore it had raised. So, not only investors havent got any returns, they havent even got their initial money back, said one of the investors who did not want to be identified.The fund is now operating without any valid extension from its investors, the investor added.An email sent to Everstone Capital did not elicit any response.During its tenure, Kshitij Venture Capital had invested in 12 properties in cities such as Ahmedabad, Chennai, Indore, Visakhapatnam, Jaipur, Kochi, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mysore, Thiruvananthapuram and two properties in Vadodara. Of these, it has exited nine and written off one. Two are still to be built, the investor mentioned above said.The properties that are still to be built are in Kochi and Mysuru. The delays have been due to permissions regarding opening of theatres, said a second person familiar with the fund, explaining that the Mysuru property was in partnership with the government and the land had encroachments on it.The fund now plans to write off (the) Mysuru project as well as the permissions have yet not come, said the person.However, the person said the fund will return all the money it has taken from investors in the next six months as it is in the process of finalizing the Kochi property transaction.The Everstone Group was founded by Sain and Atul Kapur in 2006 and has more than $3.3 billion in assets under management.Its roots can be traced to Future Group and its initial businessesasset management and financial serviceswere set up in partnership with Biyani in 2006.The relationship, however, did not last long and the parties decided to part ways after a couple of years. Everstone bought out Future Groups stake in the asset management business and over time sold its stake in listed financial services company Future Capital.Everstone now has four lines of business: private equity, real estate, credit and consumer venture capital and six funds under managementIndivision India Partners ($425 million), Everstone Capital Partners II ($580 million), Everstone Capital Partners III ($730 million), Horizon Realty Fund ($350 million), IndoSpace Logistics Park I ($240 million) and IndoSpace Logistics Park II ($344 million).While Everstone scored some strong exits such as Sula Wines and Global Hospitals in its PE business, realizing more than three times the invested capital, other investments such as engineering, procurement, and construction firm Billimoria & Co. and Future Groups e-commerce venture failed to take off.Several real estate funds of the pre-2008 vintage seem to be confronting problems similar to those of Kshitij Venture Capital, according to industry experts.Post-2008, lot of funds have burnt their fingers. Very few PE funds have generated exponential returns for investors. Several retail investors saw their investments getting eroded in the post-2008 period, said Sambhav Ranka, partner at law firm IC Legal.Real estate funds have struggled to generate strong returns after the 2008 market crash, he said, adding that in the last three to four years, real estate investment has moved from equity to structured debt investments.

-0.05,"Nestlé India is making a slow climb back to its position before the Maggi recall episode, but its proving to be an uphill task. The packaged food sectors sales growth is best assessed on a year-on-year basis, as sequential comparison can be affected by seasonality. In Nestlé Indias case, the depletion in Maggis sales calls for an exception.Sequentially, the companys sales rose 12.8% to Rs.1,791 crore although it fell by 24% from a year ago. The decline was less than the 32.1% decline in sales seen in the September quarter. The product was relaunched in the December quarterthe masala variant was first and the chicken flavour was added recently.On a sequential basis, margins have improved, chiefly due to lower raw material costs. Thus, the margin of sales left after deducting material costs has increased by 1.3 percentage points sequentially and by 3 percentage points from a year ago. That benefit carried through to the operating profit margin, which rose by 2.4 percentage points sequentially but declined by 3.3 percentage points sequentially over a year ago.That does seem like a reason to celebrate. However, it is early days yet for Nestlé India and its investors. Sales in the near-to-medium term can be expected to increase, as it refills the market. Investors will want to see if the instant noodle market will bounce back to the pre-crisis levels, in terms of volumes.The Maggi episode did affect other categories and the company has become more aggressive in the market, with price discounts on some categories, to drive sales growth. This may be a function of competition too. But that has not hurt margins, at least on a sequential basis.Two factors are in Nestlé Indias favour. Its products are largely urban-centric, making it less vulnerable to the rural demand slowdown that is playing out. Urban consumption is not healthy either but has been picking up slowly, in recent quarters. The second is commodity costs and food prices remain low broadly. Sugar and palm oil prices have seen some volatility. A low raw material price situation gives the company ample legroom to grow volume sales growth even while sustaining its margins.It may seem like the proverbial fairy tale ending is just a few quarters away for Nestlé India. But investors dont think so. Its share price is down by 23% from mid-October. One major fear is that even if the noodles market recovers, it will be the likes of Patanjali noodles that may reap the benefit. This quarters sales growth was also a bit lower than what some analysts had expected.There is also the matter of the governments pending appeal in the Supreme Court on the Maggi issue. If it goes in the companys favour, and if Nestlé Indias sales growth continues on an upward trajectory at a pace that inspires confidence, then investors may regain interest in its stock.",2016-02-17,pAg3rv8FrfTJHSvaRzCCbK,"Nestlé is making a slow climb back to its position before the Maggi recall episode, but its proving to be an uphill task

0.55,"When Anoop Kumar Sharma quit state-owned Shipping Corp. of India Ltd (SCI) in 2008 as senior vice-president overseeing the chartering operations after three decades with the Mumbai-based firm and joined Essar Shipping Ltd, he would never have imagined returning to his former employer as chairman and managing director.
				   
				Eight years hence, this is what has happened.A government that is open to trying out private talent in a company that runs ships where quick decision-making means a lot, cleared the path for Sharma to take a shot at the top post.While contemporaries and colleagues give him the thumbs up, it is not clear he would have got the top job at Shipping Corp. had he stayed on because appointments there merely went by seniority.A little before he left SCI, Sharma lost out due to the lack of seniority on becoming a director for bulk carriers and tankers at the company when interviews were held by the Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB), the government headhunter. He impressed the PESB, but the much senior K.S. Nair got the job.In a way, selecting Sharma, seen as a lifetime SCI man, would be a motivating factor for the rank and file of SCI. Bringing a rank outsider could have been a de-motivating factor for people who work for the company.It was not that the government has now hand-picked Sharmait ran a proper selection process by inviting applications, short-listing candidates, conducting interviews and securing approval from the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC). Sharma was one among the eight who were interviewed by a panel headed by Indias cabinet secretary.In a way, Sharma, who started his career at Shipping Corp., has seen the best of both the worlds. The rigid and often time-consuming decision-making process that characterized state-owned firms, keeping government oversight bodies such as the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) and the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in mind, on the one hand, and the greater operational freedom in the other.Whether Sharma can put his eight years in a private shipping company to good use at Shipping Corp. remains to be seen. Because, running a shipping company, a government-owned one at that, is a different ball game altogether.For instance, despite being a so-called navratna company, a tag that allows state-owned firms greater freedom from government control, Shipping Corp. just does not have the flexibility to buy used or second-hand vessels and sell ships for further trading, which is a normal part of the shipping business globally.Asset play requires taking quick decisions.There are times when selling a ship makes much more commercial sense rather than operate it at rates that dont even allow recovery of operating costs. This is one of the ways fleet owners shore up their financials in a depressed freight market. SCI, once a target for privatization during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, had never sold a ship for further trading since starting operations 54 years ago. Successive chairmen and managing directors (CMDs) have been reluctant to take a call on selling trading ships (which can be run for many more years) due to fear of agencies such as CVC, CAG and the Central Bureau of Investigation.If CMDs are given immunity from such oversight bodies, the company would be able to improve its efficiency and profitability by several notches. Similarly, buying second-hand ships requires securing time-consuming government approvals.Since April 2013, SCI had cancelled orders for building 12 new ships after shipyards jumped delivery dates. This allowed the company to preserve cash between 2011 and 2014 when it reported three consecutive years of losses.Shipping Corp. needs to re-deploy Rs.330.65 crore of refund money received from the shipyards on order cancellations which were originally part of the proceeds of the follow-on public offer (FPO) in November 2010. This money can only be used for buying ships because that was one of the purposes of the follow-on public offer.For close to a year now, the company has been looking for at least six second-hand ships but managed to buy just one shipan offshore oil exploration support vessel from a subsidiary of Indias The Great Eastern Shipping Co. Ltd. With ship prices at record lows, buying ships at low prices would help when the market picks up.Last week, the company issued a tender for buying a 7-11 year old suezmax tanker (called so because it can transit the Suez Canal fully laden) which can carry as much as 160,000 tonnes of crude oil. In the private sector, whether in India or abroad, ship acquisitions, both new buildings and second-hand, are never through tenders; they are always done through negotiations.Sharma will have to contend with such restrictions unless the government decides to ease them in the larger goal of professionalizing SCI.In much the same way as Shipping Corp., the government could consider hiring professionals from the private sector to run some of its state-owned ports that have always remained a fiefdom of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS).P.

				The Edinburgh-based bank, more than 70% owned by the British taxpayer, reported a loss attributable to shareholders of 469 million pounds, compared with a profit of 940 million pounds boosted by the disposal of US unit Citizens in the same period last year.The loss was more than twice the 231 million pounds loss estimated by analysts, according to a poll supplied by the bank.RBS also said it would miss an end-2017 deadline to sell its Williams and Glyn branch network, a condition of its 2008 state rescue. Weve said that 2015 and 2016 would be noisy as we work through legacy issues and transform this bank for customers. These results reflect that noise, chief executive Ross McEwan said in a statement. McEwan is in the midst of a vast, multi-year restructuring of the bank, which includes asset sales, job cuts and multi-billion dollar charges to settle litigation and pay fines for historic regulatory breaches.The losses were partly driven by a fresh 425 million pounds misconduct charge and an 82% year-on-year rise in third quarter impaired loans to 144 million pounds.The bank also reported 469 million pounds of additional restructuring costs, largely as a result of its extended struggle to sell Williams and Glyn. But unlike rivals Lloyds Banking group and Barclays, RBS did not record any provisions for repaying customers mis-sold payment protection insurance after taking a 450 million pounds charge in the last quarter.The bank reported higher-than-expected total income of 3.3 billion pounds for the three months to the end of September, reflecting efforts to step up lending to maintain its status as Britains biggest corporate lender.The bank more than tripled the sum set aside to cover legal costs as it edges closer to a 4 billion pounds lawsuit brought by investors who claim they were misled into supporting a cash call just months before its near-collapse in 2008. The case is due to reach court in March.Meanwhile, the bank continues to wait for what analysts broadly expect to be the biggest regulatory penalty in its history for its role in mis-selling US mortgage bonds.The bank said it continues to cooperate with the US department of justice in its ongoing investigation but gave no guidance on when the issue might be resolved.RBS, which succumbed to a 45.5 billion pounds state bailout during the 2007-09 financial crisis, has not made an annual profit since 2007.

0.98,"New Delhi: The Union power ministry has told the influential goods and services tax (GST) Council chaired by finance minister Arun Jaitley that implementing GST in its current form could push up power generation cost, especially of renewable energy, which will further dent the ability of debt-ridden distribution companies to serve electricity unless specific relief measures are built in.
				   
				While solar panels and other equipment used for power production will come under GST, the final productelectricityhas been kept out. This means power producers will not be able to set off part of the indirect tax liability on their output using credit for the taxes already paid on raw materials and services availed.In a presentation made to the GST Council on 16 January, the power ministry proposed giving either deemed export status or zero GST rate for renewable power. The measures are intended to spare power producers from the tax cost of keeping electricity out of GST, and to compensate for the end of existing tax exemptions. According to a copy of the presentation, reviewed by Mint, the capital expenditure of renewable energy companieswind and solarcould go up by 10-12% which will warrant a power tariff increase by 30-40 paise for wind power and 40-50 paise for solar power. That is mainly because central excise duty exemptions and concessional state value added tax (VAT) on equipment and solar panels (0-5% levied by states) will make way for an 18% GST on the raw materials and services availed of by renewable power producers.According to M.S. Mani, senior director, indirect tax, Deloitte in India, about 350 goods are at present exempted from excise duty while VAT exemptions across states will add up to about 200 items. Under GST, there will be not more than 100 exemptions which means increased tax incidence on industries using items that lose benefit of exemption or concessional tax rate.The ministry has accordingly urged the council to either consider renewable power as a deemed export or merely assign a zero GST rate on clean energy, which will allow power producers to get refund of all the taxes previously paid on the raw materials and services. There is no excise duty on solar panels, but states levy 0-5% concessional VAT on them and there is a 2% central sales tax in case of inter-state supply.The ministry also proposed similar treatment for large hydropower projects, which will be reclassified as renewable energy projects.The power ministry said that there are few takers for high cost power at present. Any further tariff increase due to GST may have multiplier effect on economic development as there will be difficulty in passing through its impact to agriculture and domestic consumers, said the presentation. It also argued that higher power tariff will have an adverse impact on industrial production, GDP and the Make in India drive, in addition to impact on export competitiveness of products and services.The solar power industry is witnessing intense competition which has driven tariffs down from Rs.12 a kilo watt hour in 2010 to a historic low of Rs 3 in 2016, which means any cost escalation is likely to hurt them.There are more than 200 active players in this industry and it is heading for consolidation in the face of competition, said Inderpreet S.

0.13,"Can an 18-year-old microfinance company outshine the most valued private sector bank of India? 
				   
				This is exactly what the valuations of Bharat Financial Inclusion Ltd (BFIL) seem to suggest.The stock trades at a price-to-book value multiple of 4.1 times its estimated earnings for fiscal year 2017, while HDFC Bank Ltd is trading at a multiple of 3.9.For those who feel this is like comparing apples with oranges, let us look at BFILs peers in the non-banking financial company space. In fact, rising financial conglomerates Bajaj Finance Ltd, mortgage lending behemoth Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC) and Repco Home Finance Ltd are the ones that are getting such high valuations.Still unconvinced with the comparison? BFILs former microfinance peer Equitas Holdings Ltd, which has morphed into a bank, is valued at 2.9 times its FY17 earnings. Another microfinance turned bank Ujjivan Financial Services Ltd is no different. At the surface, BFILs 87% growth in net profit for the September quarter, its over 50% growth in loan disbursals, an asset under management growth rivalling most peers and an envious asset quality support a premium price tag. The microlenders track record post the 2010 Andhra Pradesh debacle has been impressive. Even with scorching growth, there is a semblance of caution at the company. Gross non-performing assets were 0.1% of its loan book in the September quarter.Given that BFIL is the largest and the only listed microfinance lender, it is viewed as the only door for investors to enter into a sunrise sector with promising growth potential. But is it the only entrance? It is but a technicality that separates Equitas and Ujjivan from BFIL as these are morphing into banks. By nature of business, small finance banks can be viewed as microlenders too with an advantage of access to public deposits. Perhaps fatigue has already set in with BFILs stock down 5% to a one-month low now after running-up 50% between April and September. But the jury is still out with some analysts still having a buy rating. Those like Religare Capital Markets  Ltd that have a sell tag, rely on the riskiness of the sector to justify their call.

0.57,"New Delhi: British Prime Minister Theresa Mays visit to India last week helped to spotlight Indias importance in India-UK trade as Britain looks to rebalance its commercial links with countries post Brexit, according to Patricia Hewitt, chair of the UK India Business Council. To boost investment, the India-UK CEO forum has suggested that the two governments look at a bilateral tax treaty, Hewitt said. Edited excerpts from an interview:
What are the major takeaways from PM Mays visit?It was very important indeed that PM May made India her first international bilateral destination. And I think that was very well recognised by our Indian friends. That said, two thingsone was that following the referendum on Brexit, India, which was already very important to the UK, is even more important. It has gone further up the Prime Ministers list of priorities. But there was a deeper message. There was I think a real fear on the part of our Indian friends and others in other parts of the world that the referendum meant Britain was turning inwards and even at the risk of becoming protectionist. And I think what PM May said here publicly and privately has put that fear to rest. She has made it very plain that Britain remains open for business and that Britain is not turning its back on Europe but is trying to rebalance its relationships around the world to give more importance to its non-European trading partners. I think there is a much better understanding between the two governments and critically between the two Prime Ministers on how to move forward.There seem to be many stress points in the relationshipwhether it is the Vodafone or Cairn India tax cases or Tatas plans to sell Corus. What is your view?I think the economic relationship is very strong. There are always issues in every bilateral relationship. I would say on the tax issue, of course two years ago there was the hope that those issues would be dealt with and put to rest. The Indian government for various reasons decided that wasnt possible. Those two cases are now in arbitration. They will run their course, there will be a decision. So if you like, its been factored in. At the CEOs forum meeting, there were some very constructive proposals for a possible bilateral tax treaty to create a modern framework, ensure that there is a right climate for investors and we get the maximum amount of capital coming in from the city of London directly into India. It the past, much of this has gone through Mauritius; some of it is going via Singapore now. Actually, lets have a bilateral tax treaty and deal with that issue. So actually, I would say there is less tension. The suggestion on the tax treaty came from the CEOs of both sides.Can you please elaborate a little more on the tax treaty proposal? Is there a timeline for when it should be in place?At this point, its a fairly new suggestion. It is to ensure for instance that investors dont find themselves subject to double taxation. Vodafone Plc is covered by a double taxation treaty with the Netherlands but there isnt one between India and the UK. And that is why so much British investment was routed via Mauritius and Singapore. There was a positive interest in the idea from the Indian (government) side. But bilateral tax treaties dont get negotiated overnight as you know. I think both governments were receptive to the idea.Whats the sentiment among British businesses vis-a-vis India?We recently did a survey of our membersBritish companies with an interest in Indiaand they were very positive about the reforms they had seen in the past two years, about the business environment in India and as a result, 60% of them were saying that they were more likely to increase their investment in India over the next couple of years. And that is a direct result of the improved business environment. When you look at what the Modi government has achieved in less than three years, it is very, very substantialone, the Ease of Doing Business and cooperative federalism.The introduction of GST (goods and services tax) is a major step. The bankruptcy laws, inflation and interest rates coming down, lifting the caps on limits in FDI (foreign direct investments)this is a very long list of achievements in a very short space of time.",2016-11-14,qJVS8NsWdQWDlZyJpQem0M,UK India Business Council  chair Patricia Hewitt on major takeaways from Theresa Mays India visit and investment ties between the two countries,01:30,60% of British firms say they may increase their investment in India: Patricia Hewitt

Rajesh is a very meticulous and articulate guy. Above all, Chandra trusts him completely and so will rely on him to execute his vision, said one executive. I dont see Chandra letting go at TCS and hell still work closely with Rajesh, this person, who asked not to be identified, added. Once he takes over as Tata Sons chairman, Chandrasekaran is also expected to take over as chairman of TCS.Gopinathan, 46, was handpicked by Chandrasekaran when he joined TCS from Tata Industries in 2001.

0.34,"Mumbai: Dell Technologies chairman and chief executive officer Michael Dell is determined to change the common perception of his companythat its a traditional maker of low-margin products like personal computers, servers and storage systems.
				   
				The view changed little even after Dell said in October 2015 that it will buy EMC Corp. Now that the merger of the two companies is complete, Dells strategy to alter this view is revolving around quickly rolling out new infrastructure products that have been jointly developed by Dell and EMC teams, cross-selling them to clients of both, strengthening existing partnerships with firms like SAP AG, Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp., and forging new ones even with competitors like Amazon Web Services Inc.Dell executives say they are best suited to help clients go digital with the combined entitys broad technology portfolio, which not only comprises computing products but also services and solutions in the areas of hybrid cloud, software-defined data centres and converged- and hyper-converged infrastructure (integration managed by software), platform-as-a-service, data analytics, mobility and cybersecurity.This multipronged strategy was evident when Dell took the stage at the first-ever Dell-EMC World 2016 event in Austin, Texas, on 18 October, and gave an impassioned speech that had all the trappings of a successful road map for next-gen computing.Beginning with a reiteration of the Go Big or Go Home, Baby! slogan delivered at last years Dell event, he peppered this years speech with technology buzzwords like digital, the Internet of things (IoT), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI).Alluding to Dells Digital Transformation Index , Dell underscored the presence of a digital fear among the 4,000 business leaders across 16 countries and 12 industries that were surveyed as part of a recent report. His pitch: This (digital) future is coming very rapidly and the future does not care whether you are ready. But we do... (We are) the trusted provider of essential infrastructure for the next industrial revolution.Dell evidently believes in economies of scale, made evident by his Go Big slogan. The Dell-EMC merger, announced last October, was the largest deal in tech history, topping Avago Technologies Ltds $37 billion purchase of Broadcom Corp.Dell Technologies is now a $74 billion company that comprises a PC business and affiliated businesses including virtualization (the partitioning of a physical server into smaller virtual servers in a bid to reduce costs) company VMware Inc., security firms RSA Security Llc and SecureWorks Inc., software and services (including cloud and Big Data analytics) company Pivotal Software Inc., and cloud management software firm Virtustream Inc. Dells eponymous combined business now comprises two segmentsDell EMC is the sub-brand for the companys enterprise business, including products and solutions, and Dell is the sub-brand for the companys client solutions for consumers, business and institutional customers.Dell plans to go about the task of ramping up business growth also by touting that the combined company stands as a market leader in many of the most important and high-growth areas of the information technology (IT) market, including positions as the Leader in 20 Gartner Magic Quadrants and a portfolio of more than 20,000 patents and applications.Does the pecking order bear out Dells claim?To be sure, the worldwide IT spending figure augurs well for technology companies like Dell Technologies, which figures in the top three in PCs, servers and storage.Overall IT spending is forecast to reach $3.5 trillion in 2017, up 2.9% from estimated spending of $3.4 trillion this year, according to Gartner Inc. According to the research firm, software and IT services segments have been the bright spots. Software spending is projected to grow 6% in 2016 and another 7.2% in 2017 to total $357 billion, while IT services spending is forecast to grow 3.9% in 2016 to $900 billion and 4.8% in 2017 to $943 billion.ALSO READ | Dell Technologiess road map for IndiaThe total worldwide enterprise storage systems factory revenue remained flat year-on-year at $8.8 billion during the second quarter of 2016, according to research firm International Data Corporations (IDCs) Worldwide Quarterly Enterprise Storage Systems Tracker. EMC and HPE (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) accounted for 18.1% and 17.6% of spending, respectively, of the enterprise storage market (IDC declares a statistical tie when there is less than 1% difference in the revenue share of two or more vendors.). Dell held the next position with 11.5% share of revenue during the quarter. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and NetApp Inc. accounted for 6.8% and 6.7% of global spending, respectively.Sales of server-based storage were up 9.8% during the quarter and accounted for almost $2.4 billion in revenue. External storage systems remained the largest market segment, but the $5.7 billion in sales represented flat year-on-year growth. However, according to Liz Conner, research manager of storage systems at IDC, spending on all flash-based storage deployments continues to grow and help drive the market, following the decreasing cost of flash media, deployments and availability of flash-based storage products (a sharp focus area for the combined entity, Dell Technologies).ALSO READ |In firms, PCs and smartphones coexist in a multi-device world: Michael DellIn the same period, worldwide server revenue declined 0.8% year-on-year, while shipments grew 2% from the second quarter of 2015, according to Gartner. Dell moved into the top spot in shipments, while HPE remained the worldwide leader in server revenue.Dell garnered 19.3% of the market and moved into the No. 1 position in worldwide server shipments due primarily to growth resulting from programmes it has in place in the Asia-Pacific region, most notably in China. HPE continued to lead the x86 server (Intel-based server) market in revenue with 26% of the market. IBM secured the third position with 9.1% of the market, but experienced the largest decline among the top five vendors, according to the Gartner report.Contrarian betsNotwithstanding the scepticism over the merger, there is certainly some merit in Dells claim over the economies of scale that this merger can achieve even as there remain formidable challenges that continue to keep some analysts and clients sceptical. The challenges include concerns over the sum paid for the acquisition, integration challenges, some overlap in products and technologies between Dell and EMC, leadership issues in the combined entity, and partnership conflicts since some Dell partners compete with EMC and VMware.Michael has an opportunity to redefine computing if he reinvests on innovation and can pare back the debt, said R Ray Wang, principal analyst, founder and chairman of Silicon Valley-based Constellation Research Inc. He, however, pointed out that customers and partners remain sceptical, wondering if this is an exercise to sell off the parts of the acquisition to pay down debt and save Dell, or a strategic play to own the cloud and the future of the data centre.Shedding the enterprise software assets leads us to believe that this may not be an innovation play yet but a move to sell off assets to save Dell. The experience at HP Enterprise is what customers are scared of. They dont want to see their favourite vendors exit the market where massive investments have been made. The challenge is having two legacy players come together for innovation. The math in the accounting makes it hard to believe what innovations will come about. Dell did attempt to address this road map at Dell World but most of our clients remain sceptical, said Wang.Dell is also a contrarian when it comes to defying certain technology trends. For instance, Dell became a private company on 5 February 2013, in a deal led by Silver Lake that was valued at $24.9 billionthe biggest leveraged buyout since the financial crisiseven as other tech firms seek stock market listings. Second, he believes in mergers and acquisitions even as competing companies like Hewlett Packard have split their businesses. Third, while the world is betting on smartphones, his company no longer makes them.I dont think the world needs another smartphone company, says Dell. A smartphone is just another node, explains Dell, adding that all the information you get on a smartphone comes from a data centre. And what you upload, goes back to the data centre.This, for Dell, is a business opportunity since his company provides servers that are used by data centres.Wang agrees that the smartphone market is a bad one to be in and is not worth it when you dont own the OS (operating system).However, the fact is that even as Dell remains optimistic over the future of the PC (desktops and laptops), worldwide PC shipments totalled 68.9 million units in the third quarter of 2016, a 5.7% decline from the third quarter of 2015, according to the preliminary findings of Gartner. This was the eighth consecutive quarter of decline in PC shipmentsthe longest streak in the history of the PC industry.Lenovo Corp. continued to be the worldwide market leader based on preliminary PC shipments, but HP Inc. is nearly tied for this top spot. Segment-wise, Dell claims his company is No. 1 in PCs in terms of revenue but Dell ranked third in terms of shipments with a share of 13.5% in the third quarter of 2016. (All these rankings could change when final shipment results are published by Gartner.) Dell is insistent that revenue is more important than shipments.Banking on innovationWe have been growing (the PC business) for 15 quarters. We want to be profitable so that we can reinvest in innovation, he says. Part of his companys innovation is around the PC computing system, as Jeff Clarke, vice- chairman of operations and president of client solutions, puts it. There is much innovation in the PC computing system... like the computer becoming personal and new experiences with AR/VR that provide users with new ways to interact, explains Clarke. In a 7 September blog, Clarke also points out that beyond the device, workforce transformation requires a cloud-based infrastructure to support peoples new behaviors, new devices and new expectations, which EMC can provide. He also underscored the importance of Airwatch (now a Dell company) as an EMM (enterprise mobility management) solution for managing phones and tablets.And with cloud client-computing VDI (virtual desktop infrastructure solutions) from VMWare, we are the only true end-to-end VDI provider in the industry, from planning to deployment, data center to the endpoint, on- and off-premise. Bottom line: Combining EMCs cloud capabilities with our award-winning PCs, we have just created a very powerful solution, wrote Clarke.For instance, the Dell-EMC product collaboration has resulted in products like VxRaila hyper-converged infrastructure solution from VMware that includes fifth generation Intel Xeon processors and Dells PowerEdge servers. As opposed to a converged infrastructure model (also known as hardware-defined) where the server, networking and storage can be separated if needed, in a hyper-converged infrastructure (referred to as software-defined) the components are integrated and hence cannot be split.The other part of innovation revolves around Dells belief that IoT is fundamentally changing businesses. Explaining his rationale for why we created Dell Technologies, Dell says the planet is becoming more intelligent and more connected by the minute, and ultimately will become intertwined with a vast Internet of Things, paving the way for our customers to do incredible things.Dell elaborated in his speech that as the cost of making something intelligent approaches zero dollars, intelligence is being embedded into every aspect of our physical world. We have about 8 billion connected devices on the planet, and 15 years from now there will be 200 billion or more, and all these sensors and nodes in those devices will provide access to a host of new digital applications, creating massive new sources of information. Using this information to provide better insights and build a better world may be the biggest opportunity in history, he said.Using the premise that everything improves about 10x every five years, Dell in his speech also envisioned a future with smart cities, driverless cars and nanobots that cure cancer and repair cell damage. He added that overnight shipping will seem like snail mail compared to the instant gratification of drone delivery... AR and VR will redefine work, learning and play... machine learning, deep learning, AI and unsupervised learning to all this data will unleash a torrent of innovation and progress and solve some of the worlds greatest challenges.Towards this end, Dell and EMC have made a cumulative research and development (R&D) investment of $12.7 billion over the past three years and plan to invest $4.5 billion in R&D this year, which is multiple times what the competition is investing, Dell said.Dell, for instance, has invested in six worldwide global command centres where technicians constantly monitor events like flight delays, traffic jams, weather conditions, earthquakes or even unsettling events like riots that might impact the companys ability to handle a support call. The technicians track live tweets, live broadcasts of news and weather, and map the location using geographical information systems and Google Earthall in a single window using a customized interface. India (Bengaluru) does not have a global command centre but has a social media listening command centre.In June, Dells Extreme Scale Infrastructure group unveiled Tritona liquid cooling technology that scores over traditional air-cooled solutions for data centres. It designed this water-based system to cool server chips (developed with Intel Corp.) in eBay.coms data centres.In an 18 October note, Mike Krell, lead IoT analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, agreed that Dell Technologies was uniquely positioned to help customers solve their IoT puzzle. Dell, Krell wrote, combines experience and credibility with specific vertical market enterprises, a curated partner ecosystem with deep vertical knowledge, the industrys broadest offering of IoT-focused infrastructure, and an ability to provide a world-class customer experience to help customers solve specific IoT problemstoday.But will Go Big work for Dell?Dells growth strategy also revolves around acquisitions, which Dell says will continue. Ever since Michael Dell returned to the company as its chief executive in 2007, the company has spent as much as $15 billion on more than 30 acquisitions prior to the $67 billion EMC purchase. These included EqualLogic ($1.4 billion; storage area networks, where EMC dominates), Perot Systems ($3.9 billion; IT services), SecureWorks ($612 million; security services, where EMCs RSA division has a big presence), Force10 ($700 million; data centre Ethernet switches) and Quest Software ($2.4 billion; system management and security software), among others.However, not all of those acquisitions have done well for Dell, including some with a significant presence in the Indian market (security provider SonicWALL, for instance). According to a 20 June report on TechCrunch, while Dell had reportedly paid $3.6 billion for Quest Software and SonicWALL, it was only able to recoup around $2 billion for the duo when it sold them to private equity firm Francisco Partners and hedge fund Elliott Management. Dell also had to sell Perot Systems to Japans NTT Data Corp.  for $3.1 billion in March.Nevertheless, analysts like Ashish Nadkarni, program director for IDCs worldwide infrastructure practice, believe that having a bigger, more full-service portfolio allows the combined company (Dell Technologies) to address a wide range of use cases in a very holistic fashion. In a 16 April note, he pointed out that these solutions could be diverse and even emerging, like IoT and real-time analytics. Dell and EMC can likewise take advantage of synergies when it comes to joint go-to-market efforts around compute, storage, and networking solutions,  wrote Nadkarni.He also believes that since Dell Technologies is a privately-held company, it will be able to offer the flexibility of interesting product road maps and solutions as well as additional purchasing options, like subscription-based offerings, free from the 90-day shot clock pressures typically exerted on public companies.On his part, Dell is clear that his company needs to savour customer relationships. He concludes: There are many customers who do not want to change, and we dont want to change them. There are plenty of opportunities for cross-selling. When we looked at the top 5,000 Dell customers and the top 5,000 EMC customers, we found only 1,000 common ones. So there are enormous opportunities to cross-sell among the portfolio. Customers are excited about that toothey actually like the fact that we are bringing everything together with these engineered and integrated solutions. Thats what we are focused on.",2016-11-15,qV03Hr8aiVWnLwqzhDJqpM,Dell is leveraging its EMC acquisition to offer services and solutions for companies to cope with the fast-transforming digital landscape,04:42,Will Dell make it big with EMC?
0.63,"Wipro Ltd, for now, is lagging behind Infosys Ltd in growth. Still, when it comes to mergers and acquisitions (M&As) and investments in start-ups made by the two rivals over the last two years, Infosys Ltds boss Vishal Sikka may want to look at Wipros playbook, overseen by chief strategy officer Rishad Premji. 
				   
				Rishad Premji is the son of Wipro chairman Azim Premji, and reports to Wipro chief executive officer Abidali Neemuchwala.Over the last year, Infosys, surprisingly, has shied away from buyouts, despite spending $390 million to purchase three firms in the first year of Sikkas tenure (see chart). Infosys is grappling with finding a stable management team to steer its M&A division. In July this year, Sikka asked Deepak Padaki to head the M&A team, just 18 months after Infosys reposed faith in Sikkas former SAP colleague, Ritika Suri, to oversee the M&A division.Finally, the pace of investments in start-ups made by Infosys has slowed; the firm has made only two investments since January. Infosys has spent some $33 million (out of its $500 million fund to invest in start-ups) to buy stakes in eight start-ups and an undisclosed amount in Vertex Ventures, a Palo Alto-based venture capital firm. Seven of these investments were made in 2015.M&A is an important theme for Infosys as the management expects $1.5 billion in new revenue from buyouts as part of Sikkas ambitious target of hitting $20 billion in revenue by March 2021. The three buyouts made by Infosys, for now, are estimated to bring less than $90 million in revenue.Wipros strategy is the most aggressive among home-grown IT firms, and can become a template for both Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys, its bigger rivals, in how to better deploy cash and also invest in areas which can make outsourcing companies future-ready.Wipro, in the last 18 months (since April last year, when Neemuchwala joined the company as chief operating officer), has spent over $1.13 billion in making four buyouts which, in addition to making the firm future-ready, together bring in over $550 million in revenue. TCS boss N. Chandrasekaran has not made a single buyout or an investment in start-ups in the last two years. Wipro has done a better job of M&A than most IT services firms to date, said Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm. They (Wipro) have been more deliberate whereas Accenture has been very aggressive, although the net results are the same. Wipro has got new service mixes and capabilities along with new clients. One aspect is the emphasis of taking company cultural considerations into play.Wang said that it appears that Infosys has slowed down M&As and venture activities. Infosys maintains that it continues to evaluate firms and start-ups and there is no slowdown in decision-making. Im very focused that every business unit should not have more than one acquisition to integrate and digest, Neemuchwala told Mint last week, explaining that M&As will bring in a significant share of revenue in Wipros ambition of becoming a $15 billion firm by 2020.Wipro has spent over $22 million (of a $100 million fund) in picking minority stakes in seven start-ups and a venture fund.Sikkas and Rishad Premjis style of running their M&A and venture arms is also different, as none of Infosyss executives, including Suri (who oversees Infosys Innovation Fund), have any experience in the venture capital space. In contrast, Wipros venture arm is run by Venu Pemmaraju, a former senior investment manager at Intel Capital, and company executive Biplab Adhya, who both report to Rishad Premji.One of the biggest benefits Wipro has accrued from its buyouts is that it has managed to retain the tag of Indias third largest software services firm, leaving HCL Technologies Ltd to be content at the fourth position.Wipro does not spell out the growth brought in from its four buyouts and the organic growth, but a senior executive conceded that the growth in core IT services has considerably slowed down. If Wipro manages to grow at the upper end of its 2% growth forecast in the fourth quarter, it will add $445.3 million in incremental revenue in calendar year 2016. The four buyouts are estimated to have accounted for at least $350 million in new business, translating to about 78% of all new business.HCL Technologies, which reported $6.23 billion in yearly revenue at the end of March 2016, will end with $7.04 billion in revenue at the end of March next year if it manages to grow at the managements at-best 13% annual guidance. Wipro, which does not give annual growth guidance, is expected by analysts to report at-best 5.5% growth, translating to the company recording $7.75 billion in revenue at the end of the current financial year.",2016-10-29,qeaQ9hDqenc00ogIsHBKlM,"Wipros M&A strategy, overseen by Rishad Premji, is the most aggressive among home-grown IT firms, and can become a template for TCS and Sikkas Infosys",00:03,Has Wipros Rishad Premji triumphed over Infosyss Vishal Sikka? 
0.71,"Infosys Ltds December quarter results were in line with Street expectations, which isnt great news because expectations had been running low. Revenues fell 1.4% sequentially to $2.551 billion, largely due to the ramp-down of a large project with Royal Bank of Scotland Plc. (RBS) subsidiary Williams and Glyn.
				   
				While the trouble with the RBS project was already known, it turns out that revenues from some other large clients also fell meaningfully last quarter. Revenue from the top 10 clients fell as much as 9.1% sequentially. The RBS project is estimated to have accounted for about half of that decline, which means revenue from other large customers fell 4.5% sequentially.The company management played this down, saying this was due to the seasonal weakness that is typical of the December quarter. Customers take furloughs and have a lower number of working days at the end of a calendar year.But the companys guidance for the full year and the March quarter doesnt inspire much confidence either. According to analysts at Emkay Research, the annual guidance suggests revenue growth of 0.3-1.8% in the March quarter in constant currency terms, which is lower than the 1.9% sequential growth reported by the company in the corresponding period a year ago.ALSO READ | Infosys cuts full-year revenue guidance againThe company said certain pockets of headwinds and some client specific changes are responsible for the guidance, even though most of the verticals it operates in look set for a bounce-back. Analysts at Nomura Research said in a recent note to clients that improvement in demand for IT services could be lagged and likely to reflect only by 2QFY18. They added that the recovery is not uniform with the US banking and financial services (BFS) sector improving, and European BFS, telecom, retail and healthcare client financials showing soft trends, and that the policy uncertainty on immigration in US/regulation in BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) could keep momentum slow at the start of the year.Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services Ltds December quarter results and related commentary provide little reason for any optimism. Its hardly suspiring stocks of both companies fell on Friday, with the latter falling by over 4% thanks to additional concerns about the change in its leadership.ALSO READ: TCS Q3 profit rises 8% to $1 billion, beats forecastsA silver lining in Infosyss results was a slight improvement in margins, despite headwinds such as lower employee utilisation due to furloughs and the ramp-down of the RBS contract.

One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.But while higher margins and the better-than-expected profit are welcome, investors are far more interested in growth returning to double-digit levels.

Ltds (ONGCs) deepwater block in the Krishna-Godavari basin for seven years.
				   
				Press Trust of India (PTI) and Reuters reported that a government notice seeking the penalty also gave the firms 30 days to respond. The Contractor (RIL, BP and Niko) has worked within the boundaries of the block awarded to it and has complied with all applicable regulations and provisions of the Production Sharing Contract (PSC). The claim of the Government is based on misreading and misinterpretation of key elements of the PSC and is without precedent in the oil & gas industry, anywhere in the world, an RIL spokesperson said in an emailed statement.The liability of the Contractor has not been established by any process known to law and the quantification of the purported claim is without any basis and arbitrary. RIL proposes to invoke the dispute resolution mechanism in the PSC and issue a Notice of Arbitration to the Government. BP, too, confirmed receiving the letter and said the resolution of such geological boundary disputes should be based on well-established international petroleum industry practices and in line with the PSC.RIL shares fell 1.92% on Friday to close at Rs1,005.80 on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex index dropped 0.57% to close at 27,274.15 points.It  (will be) a long court battle. The market (has) already discounted this penalty. Hence, we do not see any impact in the near future, said Rajnath Yadav, a research analyst at Choice Broking.Justice A.P. Shah, who was appointed by the government to look into the matter, said in his report presented on 31 August that the government should quantify the unfair enrichment gained by RIL and its partners.

0.24,"About 58% of all households in India (145 million out of 247 million) had access to banking services, according to the 2011 Census.
				   
				This number varied widelyfrom nearly 90% of households in Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Himachal Pradesh to less than 40% in Meghalaya, Nagaland and Manipur. There was also a significant rural-urban divide, with more than two-thirds of urban households having access to banking services while only 54% of rural households did.A few months after coming to power in 2014, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government launched the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), which sought to open low-cost savings accounts for the hitherto unbanked.While the number of accounts opened under this scheme (254 million, see http://bit.ly/1S6TFw3 ) is larger than the total number of households in India, according to the 2011 Census, it is not clear how many unique households the PMJDY customers belong to, and how many of those already had access to banking services.In other words, until the 2021 census, it is unlikely well find out the proportion of households with access to banking services (though the PMJDY website claims nearly 100% of households have been covered by the scheme).Access to banking matters more now in light of the recent withdrawal of Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes from legal tender. As Id written in these pages several months ago, these notes made up for about 85% (by value) of all currency in circulation in 2015-16.While Id commented then that the fiscal impact of the move will amount to about Rs12,000 crore a year (http://bit.ly/1R1W4a0), the number is going to be far lower, thanks to the new Rs500 and Rs2,000 notes that are being introduced. The extent to which the new notes will replace the old is not yet known; so, it is not possible right now to estimate the fiscal impact of the move. Removing 85% of all currency by value from circulation has had an impact on ordinary people, though, with the sudden drop in liquidity causing friction in even basic transactions that are otherwise straightforward. While small-value transactions might yet be conducted using smaller notes that are still legal tender, access to the banking system has become a necessary condition for larger transactions. More specifically, since cheques can be used while transacting only with trusted parties (thanks to the risk of a cheque bounce), access to debit cards determines the ability to transact in large amounts (until the new currency has sufficiently replaced the old).In September 2016 (the last month for which data is available), there were 728 million debit cards outstanding in India. This doesnt imply many people have debit cards, though, since many people have multiple bank accounts and debit cards. In September, each of these 728 million cards was used (on an average) once to make an ATM withdrawal, with an average withdrawal of Rs3,000. The number of times the average debit card is being used for ATM withdrawals has been falling steadily over the years, though (see chart 1).While the decline in the use of debit cards at ATMs seems steady over time, one period shows a prominent (discontinuous) declinelate 2014-early 2015. This period coincided with the launch of PMJDY, where three-fourths of new account holders (195 million out of 255 million) were also given Rupay debit cards (as chart 2 shows, there was a discontinuous jump in the number of debit cards outstanding in this period).What the two graphs together suggest is that while the Jan Dhan Yojana opened new bank accounts and gave debit cards, a large number didnt bother using these accounts or debit cards.This is worrying from the point of view of the recent withdrawal of high-value notes since it suggests that the access to banking services based on the number of accounts or cards is actually an overestimate (in terms of actual usage).While some of these never used accounts (according to the PMJDY website, about 23% of all PMJDY accounts have never seen action, and have zero balances), they  might start seeing balances soon as people deposit their high-value currencies into the accounts.The use of formal banking can be a logistical and cultural challenge, and it is not clear if those who have so far not used bank accounts will be able to do so immediately. A lot of people are not going to have it easy for the next few weeks until the withdrawn currency has been adequately replaced in the system.",2016-11-14,qrSQCsXhEPEnXEcZ1z13jP,"Until the 2021 census, it is unlikely well find out the proportion of households with access to banking services ",00:50,Access to banking services an overestimate?
-0.06,"Mumbai: Union Budget 2017s proposals on electoral funding reforms have found favour generally, but the plan to issue so-called electoral bonds is seen as yet another attempt by the government to step on the turf of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
				   
				While all details on electoral bonds are not out yet, heres what is known: a person wishing to donate to a political party can purchase these bonds from an authorized bank using cheques or digital payment methods. These bonds shall be redeemable only in the designated account of a registered political party. To issue these bonds, the government will amend the RBI Act. On the face of it, these bonds look like bearer bonds. These are instruments which are not registered in the name of a specific owner and will pay to whoever bears them.Section 31 of the RBI Act gives power, as of today, to issue bearer bonds to RBI and government. The bearer bond has the characteristic of a currency. That is why the power is not given to a bank, said a senior RBI official on condition of anonymity.The RBI Act states that other than the central bank and central government, nobody can issue notes which have the characteristic of a banknote or a currency note. Hence, the government move to amend the Act to allow commercial banks to issue such bonds is leading to some discomfort among RBI officials who feel it will erode some of the central banks authority.The issue is especially sensitive coming at a time when two former governorsY.V. Reddy and Bimal Jalanhave expressed concern over RBIs eroding autonomy after the government rode roughshod over the central bank while demonetizing high-value currency notes.This will unnecessarily fragment the note-issuing authoritys capacity. The government can do without amending the Act, said a senior banker on condition of anonymity.Such bonds have nothing to do with RBIs authority or autonomy, said an expert in financial markets, but added that they are a bad idea nonetheless. RBI is a creature of RBI Act and if the government amends the Act, RBI will have to comply. I dont see the governments move to issue electoral bonds as infringing on RBIs autonomy, said Ajay Shah, professor, National Institute for Public Finance and Policy.A bearer bond assumes the character of cash. Then there is no difference if political parties are funded by cash or through electoral bonds. It doesnt improve the transparency of the funding process, said Shah.This is not the first time that the government has issued bearer bonds. In 1987, the then government floated a development bond called Indira Vikas Patra, which was issued through post offices. Since this had the characteristic of a bearer bond, it conferred anonymity to the holders of this bond.

0.25,"Agriculture is the primary source of livelihood for about 58% of Indias population. Despite agriculture being one of the largest sources of livelihood in rural India, the sector is vulnerable to periodic droughts and floods, and farmers lack market access, marketing networks and information systems. 
				   
				Software solutions provider SourceTrace Systems considers this an important global issue to address by bringing the latest technologies to the last mile of agriculture.Producing enough food for a growing population and ensuring ethical production to minimize the environmental impact and equitable treatment of farmers is one of the major challenges of our generation, says Venkat Maroju, chief executive officer, SourceTrace Systems.SourceTrace was nominated in the Agriculture & Environment category at the mBillionth Awards 2016 organized by the Digital Empowerment Foundation.This is a great opportunity not merely for social impact but a large market opportunity for building a viable business, says Maroju.The Massachusetts-based companys eServices Everywhere (ESE) platform provides solution for agriculture, aquaculture, plantation and forestry. The ESE Agri Solution tracks the flow of goods from the source to the central processing facilities even in the most remote areas. We consider smallholders are the key for global food supply and agriculture is the major industry to ensure food safety and sustainability, says Maroju, who has been heading the company since 2012. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, smallholders are small-scale farmers, pastoralists and forest keepers who manage areas varying from less than one hectare to 10 hectares.Smallholders are characterized by family-focused motives such as favouring the stability of the farm household system, using mainly family labour for production and using part of the produce for family consumption. Data from the FAO shows that 80% of the farmland in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia is managed by smallholders. While 75% of the worlds food is generated from only 12 plants and five animal species, making the global food system highly vulnerable, biodiversity is key to smallholders who keep many rustic and climate-resilient varieties and breeds alive.SourceTrace was founded in 2006 by Sandeep Chatterjee and Stephen Sellers. When the founders moved out, Maroju, an MBA graduate from MIT Sloan School of Management, took charge as the CEO in 2012. The company, which was providing remote transaction solutions for financial service, agriculture, healthcare and micro-insurance organizations, started focusing only on agriculture and its allied sectors.In 2009, Maroju, who hails from Telangana, quit his corporate job in the US and returned to India to launch his own company called Factum Ventures for empowering smallholder farmers. Having grown up in rural Telangana, and having witnessed the distress of farmers, Maroju explored solutions for sustainable agriculture and to empower smallholders farmers through adoption of latest information and communication technology (ICT) tools. Maroju later wound up the venture and joined SourceTrace. When Maroju took over as the CEO, SourceTrace was working on several diversified sectors. The main task before us was to transform the organization to focus on agriculture and allied sectors which play a vital role in world economics, says Maroju. These sectors which employ more than 70% of smallholders need to adopt technology for sustainability and empowerment. So, our focus was to impact a large number of smallholders in agriculture, aquaculture, plantation, forestry sectors and allied sectors spread across the globe, provide mobile applications and solution to the organisation that are associated with these farmers, he says.The penetration of the mobile has made it more adaptable and usable widely to connect with farmers. Our solutions can be used even in low bandwidth environments, which enables farmers to participate in global markets, Maroju says.SourceTraces product is used by small co-operatives and farmer produce companies to large agribusiness corporations and government agencies working in the sustainable development sector.The companys products have been deployed in 12 countries in Asia, Africa, South and Central America. It reaches more than 250,000 farmers, especially in developing economies. SourceTrace, which has more than 60 employees across the US, India, Bangladesh and Costa Rica, is currently working with an organization, Chetna Organic, in Andhra Pradesh for promoting sustainable organic cotton.With funding support from NABARD Consultancy Services (NABCONS), a wholly owned subsidiary of the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), it is conducting a study on agricultural projects in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. SourceTraces application is used for procurement of vegetables from farmers and to improve farmers market access by Krishi Pragati Foundation in Pune. UTZ, a Netherlands-based organization, uses it for monitoring and evaluation of small holder cocoa farmers in Ivory Coast.SourceTraces Android-based mobile application is mapped to individual handsets and gets automatically activated via in-built GPS on a farmers farm location. The application is connected to the web version centrally, through which information, monitoring and advisory services are generated instantaneously and millions of smallholder farmers get connected across wide geographical areas, says Maroju, adding that the application is scalable and the technology completely developed in-house.We currently do not have our resources in Africa, but fortunately we have the largest farmer base in Africa. We work through number of business partners in Africa and it is working out well so far, says Maroju. Getting recognition for our farmer-centric solution will help various development agencies who are working towards sustainability and empowerment using mobile technologies to achieve food security, safety and smallholders empowerment, he says.Mint has a strategic partnership with Digital Empowerment Foundation, which hosts the Manthan and mBillionth awards.",2016-10-16,rVnlSycTzXx5yQMoOHqmaM,SourceTrace Systemss eServices Everywhere platform tracks the flow of goods from the source to the central processing facilities even in the most remote areas,23:59,Bringing the latest tech to the last mile of agriculture
0.4,"San Francisco: Juergen Schmidhuber taught a computer to park a car. Hes also showing that same machine how to trade stocks and detect flaws in steel production. Unrelated as these tasks may appear, Schmidhuber thinks a seemingly random training regimen is key to creating artificial intelligence that can solve any problem.
				   
				Schmidhubers AI theories tend to carry weight. In 1997, he co-authored a seminal paper that laid the groundwork for modern AI systems. It introduced a form of memory modelled after the human brain that helps computers make decisions based on context and prior experiences. The concept underpins most modern AI networks. Today he serves as the head of a Swiss AI institute thats proven to be a fertile breeding ground for many of the worlds top experts. The New York Times recently referred to him as a would-be father of AI.ALSO READ | Charting our artificial intelligence futureIn the last couple years, Schmidhuber has been toiling away in relative obscurity on a small venture called Nnaisense SA. As his ambitions grew, the company, whose name is pronounced nascence, raised its first round of venture capital this month. The funding shows that investors are willing to make a bet on Schmidhuber and his big ideathat just as with a child, the more skills Nnaisenses AI acquires, the easier it is to learn new ones.Schmidhuber, a consummate academic, said he decided to raise money partly to guard against the likes of Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Baidu Inc. The big companies came in and tried to hire my best people away, he said. One of the reasons that I had to become an entrepreneur, as well as an academic, was to try to defend that.Creating an all-purpose AI is a steep challenge for any company, let alone one with 15 employees. Nnaisense may not have the vast reams of search data on which Googles machines learn, but it can more nimbly jump from project to project, exposing its digital mind to many different experiences in the process. We always let it learn something new on top of the previous professions, Schmidhuber said. As you are learning new things, you want to make the task more complex.ALSO READ | Reverse-engineering artificial intelligenceSchmidhuber believes that by contracting out the services of his company to a variety of industries, the skills learned from each job will gradually snowball into a system capable of tackling any challenge it faces. Some within the AI community are skeptical of Schmidhubers bullishness. Companies such as International Business Machines Corp. and German start-up Arago GmbH have worked for years on applying AI to various unrelated projects without achieving consciousness.

-0.62,"Mumbai: One of the biggest drivers of Indias superlative macro-economic performance in the recent past has been a relatively under-appreciated element: oil. Since 2014, the dramatic fall in crude oil prices has helped India contain her twin deficits, and tame inflation. But with oil exporting countries planning to curtail oil supply, raising the possibility of a rise in oil prices, the Indian economy might soon have to deal with another pain point besides demonetisation.
				   
				The extent of the gains from lower oil prices since mid-2014 is under-appreciated as the benefits have not been evident in the retail prices of petrol or diesel. However, the government did improve its finances, using the opportunity to increase the amount of taxes collected on petroleum products, as the charts below illustrate.The excise duty collected by the Union government on petrol and diesel has been hiked nine times since November 2014. The Union governments tax collection from petrol and diesel has increased from 0.4% of GDP in 2013-14 to 1.1% in 2015-16, i.e. an increase of 70 basis points (bps) in two years. To put this in perspective, this is more than the 60 bps reduction achieved in gross fiscal deficit (from 4.5% of GDP to 3.9% of GDP) over the same period. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.In other words, the entire reduction in Indias fiscal deficit could be attributed to the increase in Centres tax revenue from petrol and diesel alone. Hence, it is fair to say that falling crude oil prices have driven the improvements in Indias public finances over the past couple of years. Looking at more recent data for the first half of the fiscal year ending March 2017 (April-September 2016), and combining taxes with other oil-linked receipts such as dividends from public sector petroleum companies and states VAT collection on petroleum products, we find that the total receipts of the Centre and state governments from the petroleum sector have risen by about 50 bps since fiscal 2015 to 3.14%.Even the above-mentioned gains from the petroleum sector might be an underestimate because besides the increase in taxes, the Centre also gained from reduced subsidy burden owing to the fall in crude prices. Diesel prices were deregulated in 2014 and the diesel subsidy was eliminated in the last fiscal year (2015-16) itself. Previously, subsidy on diesel would cost 0.6% of GDP (FY14), jointly borne by the government and the public sector petroleum companies. Besides, subsidies on PDS kerosene and LPG have also reduced; however these reductions could also be attributed to government initiative to reform rather than a fall in petroleum prices per se. The upcoming Union Budget 2017 is likely to assume an average crude oil price of $55-$60 per barrel, as reported by the Hindustan Times. However, there remain risks that oil prices, which are already near $55 per barrel, could shoot up if the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and other oil exporters make good on their pledge to cut global oil supply by around 1.8%. Such a scenario, according to the International Energy Agency, would move the global oil market into deficit in the first half of 2017, i.e. demand would outstrip supply, after more than two years of comfortable surplus.In such a scenario, if oil rises above the governments comfort zone to say around $70 per barrel, then the government could lose tax revenues equivalent to about 0.4% of GDP which would jeopardize the governments plan to cut the fiscal deficit to 3% of GDP next year.To illustrate, in a hypothetical scenario where the global crude oil price is $70 per barrel in the coming fiscal year (2017-18) and the USD/INR exchange rate remains stable at 68, the government could either allow the petrol price (Delhi) to rise by another Rs10 to over Rs80 per litre, or reduce its excise tax duty from currently Rs21.48 per litre to Rs11.48 (if it wishes to keep prices same). If the government decides to reduce excise duties on petrol and diesel in similar fashion, then the Centres revenue from petrol and diesel could shrink to 0.7% of GDP in fiscal year 2018 compared to 1.1% in fiscal year 2016, back-of-the-envelope calculations show (assuming annual growth of 11.4% and 4.1% in demand for petrol and diesel respectively, as has been observed in the year so far). Thus, a spike in oil price to around $70 per barrel is enough to strain our public finances and add 0.4% to the Centres fiscal deficit. This would be over and above the increasing expenditure obligations on interest, salaries and pensions, compounded by Seventh Pay Commission recommendations and OROP. Read more If the government wishes to keep petrol and diesel prices unchanged, without sacrificing its tax revenues, then it would have to resort to subsidies (or under-recoveries) as used to be the case in yesteryears. Thus, no matter the recourse adopted, government finances will most likely be hit severely if oil prices rise, unless the government allows the prices of petroleum products to rise. Besides posing risks for the governments finances and stoking the fires of inflation, a rise in oil prices would also worsen the current account deficit. Assuming crude oil prices at $70/barrel and pencilling a constant pace of rise in volumes in oil imports and exports, as seen in the current fiscal year so far, and keeping all other things constant, Indias current account deficit could widen to 1.7% of GDP in fiscal 2018 compared to 1.1% of GDP in fiscal 2016.Indias net oil and gas import bill, i.e. adjusting for exports of petroleum products, amounts to around 2.5% of GDP, higher than Indias overall current account deficit and hence plays a big role in determining the dynamics related to the balance of payments. Thus, if there is one commodity to watch out for in 2017, it is likely to be oil.",2017-01-18,ro8NqXjBC4gk1i2OAQdGYN,The entire reduction in Indias fiscal deficit over the past few years can be attributed to the fall in crude oil prices,08:51,Why oil can spoil Indias budget math

-0.13,"San Francisco: Eduardo Frias, chief information officer at Beachbody LLC, recently traveled to San Francisco to hear a pitch from Oracle Corp.s top brass.
				   
				Beachbody was already a longtime user of Oracle business software for such tasks as finances and supply-chain management. Now chairman Larry Ellison wanted to sell Frias on a new product: direct access to remote data centers brimming with servers and networking tools -- a package of services that Santa Monica, California-based Beachbody now buys from cloud-computing leader Amazon.com Inc.Frias was intrigued. Oracle has made a lot of progress developing a product that could compete with Amazon, he said. Theyre doing incredibly, much better than in the past, he said of Oracles pitch at the Oracle OpenWorld conference in September. But Frias, whose company makes the P90X high-intensity home-fitness videos, has yet to take the plunge.Tens of thousands of businesses are loyal to Amazon Web Services, and it wont be easy for Oracle to erode Amazons lead in the market for public cloud computing. Thats not stopping Oracle chief executive officers Mark Hurd and Safra Catz from pouring billions of dollars into big bets on acquisitions, new hires and fresh products to advance Ellisons plan to target the industry. On Monday, they landed a cloud leader when Oracle completed its $9.3 billion acquisition of NetSuite Inc., which specializes in financial software. This latest gambit means less competition with older rivals such as SAP--and more with Amazon, Google and even Microsoft Corp.This is part of a bigger strategy, Hurd said in an interview. Were in the middle of a very significant transition in the IT industry.Brisk growthHurd can point to improving numbers. The growth rate for Oracles most closely watched cloud businesses -- including applications for finance, human resources and databases--jumped to 77% in the quarter ended 31 August, topping 66% in the previous period. These gains outpace those of key rivals, though its starting from a smaller base.But the transition is just beginning, and should have started earlier, some analysts said. Cloud revenue has yet to reach 15% of overall sales--not yet enough to prop up results. As traditional products slowed, total company sales missed estimates, climbing 1.7% in the quarter that ended in August. It was another reminder that the shift to the cloud has been uneven, and is not a fait accompli.Oracle waffled a little; now, theyre done waffling, said Dave Bartoletti, an analyst at Forrester Research. Theres no choice for Oracle but to do this. All of the money is going to cloud software and cloud infrastructure for the next 10 years.Wall Street has mixed opinions about Oracles plans, which could take years to prove out. Shares are up 7% so far this year, narrowly outpacing some of the major indices. Analysts have slightly more buy ratings on the stock than they did a year ago, while sells have fallen.The company has navigated identity changes in the past. It grew from a small database company founded in 1977 to become one of the largest tech companies in the world. It boasts a public market value among the top 50 in the US.Oracle is looking outside itself for help. In fiscal year that wrapped up in May, almost a third of the developer hires in the Oracle Public Cloud group came from competitors, according to a person familiar with the matter.NetSuite DealAcquisitions are also part of the cloud growth strategy. After a lull in large deals, Oracle secured its second-biggest takeover ever with NetSuite, though the deal wasnt without its critics. T. Rowe Price, one of NetSuites largest investors, said the the offer undervalued the target, and asked Oracle to pay $133 per share instead of the agreed-upon $109. NetSuites stock fell to less than $90 at one point in October when it looked like the deal was in jeopardy, yet Oracle insisted its price was final. In the end Oracle won approval with holders of 56% of eligible shares endorsing it.NetSuite provides cloud-based software that manages key functions in finance, part of whats called enterprise resource planning. While the companies have products in the same general areas, there is little direct customer crossover. Almost all of NetSuites customers have 700 or fewer employees, while nearly all of Oracles comparable clients have about 1,000 or more, according to another person with knowledge of the company.Oracle is also moving forward with home-grown tools, and in September unveiled a new plan for its own services for infrastructure, the core computing feature that lets developers easily build applications or work with databases. This business has been the laggard at Oracle, at less than a quarter of the size of the other cloud offerings and with slower growth.Hurd said the latest push -- backed by the companys own big data centers with more efficient servers -- is something new for the business that can help spur the next chapter of growth. Hes betting customers would rather have more products from fewer providers than a patchwork of tools from a smattering of companies. Oracle will let customers move existing applications to the cloud in areas such as human resources and customer relationship management, while providing developer tools and basic computing gear.This is all part of a thoughtful strategy that brings together a holistic cloud suite of services to address the broader market, he said.Amazons databaseThe bigger shift into cloud infrastructure follows Amazons decision to move more aggressively onto Oracles home turf in the database sector, according to Bartoletti. Online retailer Amazon has turned this strategy into a fine art on its traditional commerce side: attracting customers with one product, and then getting them to buy something else.Given Amazon Web Services size and features, its still a one-horse race in the broader market for infrastructure services, said Carl Brooks, an analyst at 451 Research. In the third quarter, Amazon had about 45% of the market for infrastructure as a service, where companies buy basic computing and storage power from the cloud, according to Synergy Research Group. Amazons revenue in this market is more than twice that of the next three players combined, Synergy said.Its helpful from an education standpoint for Oracle to say, Yes, we have AWS-style service capabilities, Brooks said in an e-mail. But theyre not in the same league yet.Ellison went out of his way to tout the new products during his OpenWorld keynotes in September. He didnt hold back underscoring Oracles plan to take on Amazon, mentioning his Seattle-based rivals name more than 60 times during one talk.Amazons lead is over, Ellison said.Amazon didnt exactly embrace Ellisons take. In an interview with Business Insider, AWS CEO Andy Jassy fired back at Ellison, calling the speech a classic old-guard technology tactic, in which a latecomer with less functionality and fewer customers tries to establish itself by manipulating benchmarks. And Amazon has done more to buttress its position, recently unveiling a deal with VMware Inc. to easily manage cloud services.Worth a LookYet Oracles new option is catching some attention. EHarmony has been a customer of Oracle products for about a decade, including the database -- and is using the software makers cloud-based Service feature, which helps clients better connect with their customers, according to Ninish Ukkan, the online dating services senior vice president of technology.We are exploring it -- its too early to say, he said. Because we have such a big footprint with Oracle, especially with our databases, its definitely worth a look.Boingo Wireless is another company that likes what it sees as the software provider ramps up sales efforts to better address the cloud. Boingo, which provides technology for wireless access, has been using Oracles software for its finances since last year after it outgrew a Microsoft offering, according to chief financial officer Peter Hovenier. Oracles sales rep was key in his decision, he said, as he looked at different options for his department.He really impressed upon the fact that this was a growing product for Oracle, he said. And while it was still early, I was getting good attention. Bloomberg",2016-11-08,sAMdv7ZZKtdxsbFcNWAj1L,Oracle has made a lot of progress developing a product that could compete with Amazon,22:22,Oracle widens cloud investments to battle bigger Amazon threat

According to him, there are some headwinds in the retail and healthcare business segments, which could lead to quarterly ups and downs in the firms performance.The two segments account for 22.5% of Infosyss revenues. Notwithstanding all this, the company has maintained its annual revenue growth forecast of 11.5-13.5%.
				   
				Investors were naturally disappointed. The chances of the company beating its revenue guidance are now slim. Infosys shares fell 4.6% after Raos comments became public. The moot question for investors in information technology (IT) services companies is whether the entire sectors performance will be choppy this year.According to Rao, Infosys is positioned well in the banking and financial services (BFS) vertical, where it has won large deals and has a strong pipeline.Analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a 7 June note to clients that the financial performance of US and European BFS firms has deteriorated sharply in the March quarter. Revenues of companies that are part of the Fortune 500 fell 10% from a year ago, while their operating profit fell 22%.The financial performance of clients in a sector is typically seen as a lead indicator for IT services demand. Data from the sector, which accounts for about 35% of revenues of Indian IT companies, suggests that FY17 could be a challenging year. Besides, macro data from the US has not been encouraging eitherprivate sector job additions are significantly lower, compared with year-ago levels and consumer confidence has declined.On the other hand, while Rao said that the performance of retail companies in the US has deteriorated and is the poorest in recent times, data collated by Nomura suggests otherwise. The broker said in its note that the performance of US Fortune 500 retail companies remains sluggish, although things havent worsened. To be sure, their revenues and profit were flat in the March quarter, more or less in line with the trend in the preceding quarters.Its likely that the set of clients that Infosys services are more troubled vis-a-vis the average performance of the sector. As such, the FY17 performance of companies will continue to be skewed, and will depend on the exposures that companies have to certain sectors and companies.But, overall, Infosyss latest comments are helpful as they bring in a reality check for some investors who were expecting Infosys to beat its revenue guidance.

				Subbarao wants the government to stick to the fiscal consolidation path but most bankers (not all) want Indias finance minister to focus on growth, even if that means a slightly expansionary budget. Chiefs of the three biggest state-owned banks also said they would like the budget to take note of the capital requirement of banks.Most analysts say that the government will be able to stick to the target of a fiscal deficit of 3.5% of gross domestic product, or GDP, in the current fiscal year that ends in March and aim for at least 3.3% fiscal deficit for 2018. The government has been diligently lowering the fiscal deficit for seven years since 2012 when the deficit touched 5.9% of GDP.Subbarao feels that even though there could be a slowdown in growth in the wake of the so-called demonetisation exercise, the government should adhere to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act which seeks to institutionalize financial discipline.ALSO READ | Banks eyeing big-ticket reforms in budget: SurveyThe original objective of the Act was to bring down the fiscal deficit to 3% of the GDP by March 2008 but in the aftermath of the global meltdown, the Act was first postponed and later suspended in 2009.

Singh to reconsider reinstating the provisions of the Act submitted its report on 23 January, a week before the presentation of the budget.The report is not in the public domain but people familiar with its recommendations say the N.K. Singh Committeewhose members include RBI governor Urjit Patel and the chief economic adviser to the finance ministry Arvind Subramanianis in favour of fiscal consolidation but not sacrificing growth.While no one can question the importance of keeping the fiscal deficit low, the budget should also focus on reform in the banking industry.

The banking industry also made sure that around Rs15 trillion worth of Rs1000 and Rs500 notes have come back to the system in 50 days in the biggest ever currency swap programme in the world.In his address to the nation on 31 December, a day after the banks closed the currency swap window, respecting the autonomy of the banks, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed to them to move beyond their traditional priorities, and keep the poor, the lower middle class, and the middle class at the focus of their activities. He announced cheaper home loans for the poor, 30 million debit cards for farmers, doubling the amount of loan (taken from banks as well as non-banking finance companies) to be underwritten by the government and higher fund flow to the small industrial units, among other things. The budget may have many more such schemes for rural development and employment generation but we need a healthy banking system to implement such schemes.ALSO READ | Budget 2017: Ten things to look out forThe RBIs December Financial Stability Report has pointed out that the gross non-performing loans of the Indian banking industry rose to 9.1% in September 2016 from 7.8% in March, pushing the overall stressed loans to 12.3% from 11.5% and it will rise further. While these reflect the health of the industry, the state of affairs in the public sector banks is far worse. Their stressed loans are at least 16%, more than three times than that of private banks. In fact, the report has said that the public sector banks may record the highest bad loans and lowest capital adequacy ratio, a measurement of capital against risk-weighted assets, among all banks. Has the government done anything meaningful to address these issues?The government had held an offsite with the banking bosses, Gyan Sangam, in Pune, in January 2015. Addressing the bankers, Modi had said it was a unique initiative and the first step towards catalyzing transformation. In August 2015, finance minister Arun Jaitley announced the grand Indradhanush planthe solution to the problems of the industry, which Modi explored in Gyan Sangam. It promised to tackle several critical issues, including appointments, capitalization, stress in the system, empowerment, accountability and governance reforms to revamp functioning of the government-owned banks.Estimating the capital requirement between fiscal year 2015 and 2019 at around Rs1.8 trillion, assuming 12-15% growth in bank credit, the government has committed to pump in Rs70,000 crore in phases till 2019 when the new Basel norms kick in. It also feels that the public sector banks (PSBs) market valuations will improve significantly following governance reforms, tight bad loan management and risk controls, significant operating improvements and, of course, capital allocation in successive budgets. Higher valuations, coupled with sale of non-core assets as well as improvement in performance would enable these banks to raise money from the market, the government had said.It also issued a circular that said there would be no interference from the government and the banks would be encouraged to take their decisions independently, keeping the commercial interest of the organization in mind.A government note describes the Indradhanush framework for transforming the PSBs as the most comprehensive reform effort undertaken since banking nationalisation in 1970 adding, Our PSBs are now ready to compete and flourish in a fast-evolving financial services landscape. If indeed setting up of the Banks Board Bureau with a string of vague and ambiguous terms, splitting the top post in PSBs between chairman and managing director and CEO and appointing a few private sector bankers as heads of PSBs are meaningful reforms, then Indradhanush has done wonders.Even though the credit growth has been far lower than what has been estimated, the banks would need higher capital as growing bad assets are eating into their capital but none has any idea whats happening on that front. The banks are required to set aside money or provide for their bad assets and that erodes their capital.As far as the Banks Board Bureau is concerned, I wonder whether even the members of the Bureau themselves know what they are expected to do. Its mandate includes selection and appointment of managing director and CEOs as well as non-executive chairman of PSBs, helping banks develop a robust leadership succession plan for critical positions, advising the government on the formulation and enforcement of a code of conduct and ethics for bank executives, and helping banks develop business strategies and capital raising plan, among others.Barring the top level appointments, all other assignments are vague and even here, the Bureau does not have the final say. One-fifth of Indian Overseas Banks loans have turned bad and it has recorded losses for six successive quarters till December (to the tune of Rs5,786.63 crore) but it doesnt have either the chairman or a managing director and CEO for seven months since its last boss retired in June 2016. Apparently, the Bureau recommended the executive director of a PSB for this position and it was cleared by the vigilance authoritya necessary precondition for any top appointment in a PSBbut a division of the finance ministry shot it down. Clearly, there is a disconnect between the ministry and the Bureau.The Bureau also recommended nine candidates for the posts of executive directors in various PSBs in September, but none of them has been appointed as yet. Moreover, it does not have the power to appoint the so-called non-official directors at boards of PSBs, many of whom are the root cause of mis-governance in banks.The governments plan to dilute ownership in IDBI Bank has also gone nowhere. Similarly, the employee stock option plan or ESOPs for PSBs remains a promise on paper so far.In sum, barring a few cosmetic changes, nothing significant has been done to revive the public sector banks. I would love to see finance minister Arun Jaitley using this budget to move forward with a concrete reform agenda.

For Warburg Pincus, which also bought close to 65% in Future Capital Holdings (since renamed Capital First), a listed non-banking financial company (NBFC), from Kishore Biyani in 2012, the move to buy a significant stake in Capital Float is part of a strategy to diversify the companys loan book, the people aware of the matter said. Under Future group, Capital First started as a provider of unsecured business loans and loans against property but once Warburg took over, the NBFC has focused more on the retail segment such as consumer durables loans and two wheeler loans, the second person said. Warburg feels that Capital Float will be a good fit to Capital Firsts current portfolio, the second person added.

0.11,"Finally, in the last quarter (March) of fiscal year 2016, things did get better for Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T), after three quarters of titanic struggle. But even as it posted a stellar operating performance that beat forecasts on revenue, profit and operating margin, order inflows remained elusive.
				   
				If order inflows are an indication of the times to come, then the 9% year-on-year drop in fresh orders during the quarter is not good news. For the 12-month period ended March 2016, the 12% dip in orders inflows fell short of even the management guidance of flat growth. Not to forget that the management had watered down its estimate from 15% at the beginning of the year. Perhaps the loss of orders in the power segment and the pathetic state of the heavy engineering, metals, and electrical and automation segments explains this drop.However, set this factor aside, and L&Ts March quarter leaves nothing for investors to crib about. Consolidated net revenue jumped by 18.3% from a year back as the companys core business segmentinfrastructureclocked 20% revenue growth. Information technology and financial services too contributed sufficiently to revenue growth.Even better was the beat on operating margin. At 14.7%, it topped the 14-broker Bloomberg consensus by 220 basis points as it raced ahead of the year-ago number by 190 basis points. A basis point is 0.01%. Again, margin outperformance came from the infrastructure segment, which more than compensated for the deplorable performance of the heavy engineering and hydrocarbons divisions. Fortunately, these comprise a small portion of the overall business of the juggernaut.Operating performance trickled down and L&T saw a 19% jump in consolidated net profit, way beyond what the Street expected.This is not all. The management, in its media address, appeared optimistic of an economic recovery both on the domestic turf and in overseas markets like West Asia, other regions of Asia and Africa. And it is still sitting on a massive order book of Rs.2.49 trillion, assuring decent revenue growth over the next three years. Some analysts say that with a sizeable chunk of international orders, the company may not be able to sustain the March quarters operating margin in the near term. Interest costs during the quarter rose from a year back, underlining the pressure on working capital.The moot question is: will the stock continue to inch up as it has done in the last three months, after a spark in the March quarter results? Sure, the stock is among the best plays on the economy and has more often than not outperformed benchmark indices.Or, will a drop in order inflows dampen investor sentiment? Yes, the management has guided for a 10-15% growth in order inflows for fiscal year 2017. What must not be ignored, however, is that fiscal year 2016 too started on a similar note but then estimates were trimmed thereafter.

The current corporate tax rate works out to be 30% plus cess and surcharge.

-0.69,"The March 2016 quarter will go down as one of the worst in the history of Indian banks as losses piled up and bad loans tumbled out of their cupboards. The five key takeaways are:
				   
				1) The central bank-instituted asset quality reviews full blast was spread over the second half of the year. Indian lenders added Rs.1.4 trillion in bad loans over the course of January to March. This comes on the back of Rs.97,404 crore bad loans addition in the December quarter. All said, gross bad loans for listed banks stood at Rs.5.8 trillion at the end of March, or about 8% of non-food credit. For state-owned banks, this ratio hovers close to 10%. This doesnt include restructured assets, which in many cases, would add half as much more to their stressed loans portfolio.2) The surge in bad loans was not restricted to public sector banks. Even big private lenders such as Axis Bank Ltd and ICICI Bank Ltd saw a sharp rise in bad loans, indicating that the rot runs deep. Whats more, the clean-up is not complete. Many banks have declared watch lists of assetsa good percentage of which they expect to go bad this year. For Axis, this was around Rs.22,000 crore and ICICI Rs.52,000 crore. Among state-run lenders, State Bank of India has declared Rs.31,000 crore worth of loans sensitive and Bank of Baroda about 27,000 crore.3) This big pile-up of bad loans necessitated higher provisions. Over the course of the year, banks had to set aside some Rs.1.75 trillion towards bad loans. Thus, the listed universe of banks in India ended up with losses of Rs.14,685 crore in the March quarter. This number is boosted by private bank profits. The combined losses of state-owned banks were higher at Rs.23,493 crore after a Rs.10,793 crore loss in October-December.4) These losses meant net worth got hit. For 25 state-run banks for whom data was available, net worth fell by Rs.65,350 crore, or 11.5%, in the six months to March. While the central bank had relaxed some provisions for recognizing capital, this kind of continued losses will start affecting their prudential ratios. For about one in three banks, stressed assets (net bad loans plus one-third of restructured loans) are higher than their net worth.5) With a precarious capital position, banks will find it difficult to expand lending. The current recapitalization plan of the governmentabout Rs.25,000 crore in a yearis not enough. Of course, there is a chance that many of these bad loans will be upgraded once the economy recovers and borrower firms generate cash. The wait for an economic recovery continues.",2016-06-10,tzzcv1ZhwJ0vmTqKfcci5K,"March 2016 quarter will go down as one of the worst in the history of Indian banks as losses piled up and bad loans tumbled out of their cupboards

0.33,"Investors have driven up the stocks of the listed associates of State Bank of India (SBI) by as much as 63% in the past month, ever since their merger with the parent was announced. Not surprisingly, these banks trade at significant discounts to SBI.
				   
				SBI shares, themselves, have gained by one-fifth in this period. This is despite a section of the market thinking that the merger will be a distraction for the management, which is struggling to clean up the balance sheet and resolve the bad loans problem. Note also that current chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharyas term is set to end in a couple of months.On the face of it, a merger with the associates shouldnt add to SBIs bad loans problem. The consolidation, if anything, will improve the situation marginally as the increase in bad loans will be slower than advances. The provision coverage ratio will also remain close to 60%.The SBI management has stated that there are three sources of benefit from the merger. The consolidated bank is expected to manage costs betterthe cost-to-income ratio could reduce by as much as 100 basis points (bps). One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Second, a combined treasury could perform better and, third, the lower cost of deposits will boost margins. According to Ambit Capital Ltd, the management pegs total savings at Rs.3,500 crore, which is a quarter of the last three years average combined annual profits of the parent and associate banks.On the flipside, SBI will have to bear one-time pension liability cost as its employees are covered by both pension and provident fund; however, not all employees of these associate banks are eligible for pension. The banks management had forecast this amount to be close to Rs.3,000 crore when announcing March-quarter results on 27 May.The immediate negative impact will be from pension liability provisions due to different employee-benefit structures and a harmonization of accounting policies for NPA recognition, said Alpesh Mehta from Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.The books of the associates have not been subjected to the same scrutiny as SBIs and analysts are worried that they may throw up some skeletons. SBI, itself, has declared a bad loan watch list of Rs.31,000 crore.Higher restructured assets of associate banks cloud the future outlook since there is not much visibility and clarity. One has not heard from their respective managements about how their books have been so far, cautions IIFL analyst Rajiv Mehta.Even if we build in the (SBI) managements expected synergies in our estimates, the impacts on the combined entitys RoA (12 bps) and RoE (194 bps) do not appear significant at this stage, wrote Ambit analysts in a 16 June note.

0.61,"Mumbai: IFMR Capital, which helps financial institutions serving poor people raise funds, has received $25 million in funding from Eight Roads Ventures, the proprietary investment arm of Fidelity International Ltd.
				   
				This is Chennai-based IFMR Capitals second round of institutional funding. The company raised $29 million from impact investment fund Leapfrog Investments in March 2014. Leapfrog has made a partial exit through the latest round of funding.IFMR Capital connects high-quality non-banking financial companies working among financially excluded households and businesses, such as microfinance, affordable housing finance, small business finance, agricultural finance and vehicle finance, with investors in existing and emerging debt capital markets. IFMR Capital was established in 2008.The fresh round of investment will help IFMR Capital grow its existing business and explore other opportunities across new products and sectors.  We are keen on expanding our focus into more sectors and some of the areas that we are keenly looking at are MSME lending and fintech firms. We believe that with our credit underwriting experience and use of data, we can help these firms to be ready to tap the capital markets as they grow, said managing director and chief executive Kshama Fernandes.The firm will also be looking at introducing newer products. We are working on various structured finance products and we will be introducing them soon. We do not believe in creating exotic one-off structured products, and so the focus is on creating structures that can be replicated across clients, said Fernandes.The company ended 2015-16 with a profit of almost Rs60 crore on revenue of Rs246 crore, she said.The financial services market for debt products is a $1.3 trillion in India and has been growing at an annual average pace of more than 15% over the past decade.In India, a large proportion of institutions addressing financial exclusion lack access to institutional credit themselves. There is-a significant missing middle segment, left out by the mainstream credit delivery channels, which financial institutions with specialized models of lending to the informal segment require, Fernandes added. IFMR Capital serves as the bridge for such institutions, enabling them to raise funds from the capital market.",2016-11-11,uDDjCkjsCOl9EKNJmrQJVN,The fresh round of investment by Eight Road Ventures will help IFMR Capital grow its existing business and explore other opportunities across new products and sectors,01:41,IFMR Capital raises $25 million from Eight Roads Ventures
0.55,"German multinational corporation SAP SE may be best known as an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software firm but senior executives insist that it has successfully moved beyond ERP to providing cloud computing and digital solutions as well.
				   
				Until about 2010, 70% of our revenue globally was from ERP. At the end of 2015, only about 30% of our revenue was from ERP and 70% was non-ERP, Deb Deep Sengupta, president and managing director, India subcontinent region, SAP, said in an interview.Sengupta acknowledged that while the benefits of ERP became visible in large enterprises, there was this perception that for a smaller company, SAPs technology is very hard to adopt and very expensive too. To address the issue, SAP India introduced many best practices from the implementations it had done in countries such as Brazil and Latin America. We created some packages for micro-verticals (small, specialized industry segments) and created an ecosystem of implementation partners that did not exist earlier, Sengupta said.SAP India also started working with agencies that do nation-building such as the railways, utility companies, ports and airports. We also worked a lot with the defence and home ministries, Sengupta added.In 2010, SAP launched its High-performance Analytic Appliance (HANA) software platform, which enables data processing in real or near-real time for quick business insights and improved decision-making. HANA can be deployed on premise or on the cloud, a model whereby firms do not spend upfront on licensing and equipment but pay on a per-use basis.SAP has also spent billions of dollars on acquiring firms whose solutions are cloud-centric. Some examples include Hybris, SuccessFactors, Ariba, Concur and Fieldglass. These, Sengupta said, have helped SAP rise to the world No. 2 spot in terms of revenue from cloud computing applications in 2015. Globally, we now have over 200 million users on the cloud.Even the core ERP, now christened S/4HANA has been completely re-tooled. In less than a year since its launch in 2015, we have deployed this solution in more than 2,700 companies. It is available on the cloud and on-premise. You can also deploy it in a hybrid model, Sengupta said.The 20.8-billion company, which has about 8,000 employees in India, does not give a break-up of its India revenue, but Dataquesta Cyber Media (India) Ltd publicationpegged the companys India revenue at Rs10,705 crore in fiscal 2015-16.SAP dominates the ERP software market in India; Dataquest reporting its market share at about 47%. Its product portfolio includes analytics, customer relationship management (CRM), expense management, human capital management and business-to-business commerce.The key verticals for SAP in India, according to Sengupta, are manufacturing, consumer goods, professional services and public services. Banking, financial services and insurance is another rapidly-growing vertical for the company, even though competitor Oracle Corp. leads in this space.For Sengupta, digital is not just about the front end; its an integrated thing. Its about the experience, which well provide. He observed that while digital firms are building an offline presence, physical ones are going digital too, known as the phygital trend. Sengupta cited the examples of US sportswear brand Under Armour and the multi-brand digital marketplace of the Tata group in India, Tata CLiQ, as examples of companies going phygital. To cater to this need, SAP announced the launch of the SAP Digital Boardroom in October 2015. According to Sengupta, the boardroom is a digital approach that aims to contextualize and simplify performance reporting across all areas of business in real time. Built on the SAP Cloud for Analytics Solution, the SAP Digital Boardroom incorporates fully automated business intelligence capabilities that aim to dramatically improve the quality and speed of reporting as well as collaboration in real time.SAP is also providing cutting-edge technology solutions to its clients. For instance, it has around 100 engineers working on machine learning, and that team is constantly expanding, said a 1 December 2016 report by research firm Market Realist. SAP is hoping to leverage machine learning to strengthen its cloud-based human resources suite SuccessFactors. Besides machine learning, SAP has also stepped up its investments to drive blockchain innovation. Blockchain is the technology that underlies cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Zcash.If SAP succeeds in its machine learning efforts, it could reduce competition for its products and pave the way for more revenue, the Market Realist report said. But it also cautioned that SAPs aggressive push into machine learning would put the firm on a collision course with Alphabet Inc. (parent of Google Inc.), which is also heavily into artificial intelligence research.The Internet of Things (IoT) is another area of focus for SAP; it announced an investment of 2 billion over five years in the IoT segment. As part of this plan, SAP acquired Plat.Onean IoT services providerlast September.To be sure, SAP will have its fair share of challenges in the coming years, especially in cloud computing, said analysts. For one, SAP does not have its own data centre in India yet. Sengupta pointed out that SAP is tying up with local partners for cloud services in India, but analysts remained sceptical.The growth has been easy for SAP in India when it came to the top 100 enterprises and then another 300-odd large companies, but the joy ride ends now, said Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst and CEO of Greyhound Research. He pointed out that Indian firms are wary about data residing in a foreign country. Gogia added that SAP has not found many takers for its expensive HANA. Though some enterprises have technically bought HANA licences, there are only a few of implementations in the country, as not all ERP modules are ready yet on HANA. Another reason for the lukewarm response to HANA is the lack of skill sets on HANA in India, Gogia noted.The upcoming goods and services tax (GST) regime, which would need ERP to be modified or upgraded for compliance, could also pose a challenge for SAP, Gogia said. While SAP is mandating its clients to buy S/4HANA licences if they want to migrate their existing SAP solution to a GST-compatible version, other vendors are offering to supply the GST patch for free, Gogia noted, warning that firms may shift their custom to other vendors as they embrace GST.The competition is undoubtedly stiff with the likes of Amazon Web Services (AWS), CenturyLink, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and Salesforce offering public cloud platforms. AWS and Microsoft lead the pack among global public cloud platform providers for enterprise developers. IBM and Google offer competitive options. Oracle, Salesforce, CenturyLink and SAP lag behind, according to a 29 August 2106 report by Forrester analysts Dave Bartoletti and John R. Rymer.Among the megacloud providers, SAP is a challenger, the report said. The analysts pointed out that while the HANA cloud platforms greatest strength is in shielding developers from all infrastructure configuration tasks when working with SAP business suites, companies must determine whether the platform is a good choice to also build and deploy applications that are independent of SAPs business suites since the HANA cloud platform offers only a limited set of application development and delivery functions. SAP, according to analysts, is yet to step up to the full range of language run times, databases, and analytics services of the leaders, although SAP recently released an IoT service to all customers. As a new entrant in the market, SAPs partner roster for HANA cloud platform is small, as is adoption of its platform, the report concluded.",2017-01-16,uLYxZE6K7ZZ85besrpDTIK,"SAP, the German ERP software company, has successfully made inroads into cloud computing and digital solutions",00:42,SAP: The road beyond ERP
0.84,"In what may help reduce wind energy tariffs in the country, the 1 gigawatt (GW) tender floated by state-run Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI) has received 2.6 times the quantum of bids offered for the grid linked capacity.
				   
				Experts say this may potentially bring down wind energy tariffs which currently ranges from Rs3.9 per unit to Rs5.9 per unit.The industry is eagerly awaiting the outcome, said a wind energy developer participating in the auction process, requesting anonymity.Another clean energy developer who also requested anonymity said, There is a possibility that the tariffs may fall as low as sub Rs4 per unit.Bids totaling 2,600 MW have been received from 13 companies including Adani Power, Hero Future Energies Pvt. Ltd, Renew Power and Inox Wind for the two-stage processtechnical and financial. Those qualifying the technical bid stage will be eligible for the financial bid stage. Once, the financial bids are opened, a reverse bid auction process will be run to select the developers. The last date for the bid submission was 9 January.2,600 MW is the maximum bids received. The final award can be less than that. Financial bids are yet to be opened, said Ashvini Kumar, managing director, SECI, declining to identify the companies who have taken part in the bidding process. In India, which is the biggest greenhouse gas emitter after the US and China, renewable energy currently accounts for 15%, or 45,917 MW, of the total installed capacity of 3,10,005 MW. Of this wind energy projects alone account for 28,083 MW, placing it at fourth position after China, the US and Germany. In the long run, the price difference between wind and solar will go. Now whether that happens in this tender or the next one (remains to be seen); they (wind and solar) will be competitive, Kumar said while adding that the final tender will be awarded within the next two to three weeks.Spokespersons for Inox Power and Hero Future Energies confirmed their participation in the tender.Queries emailed to spokespersons for Adani Power and  Renew Power remained unanswered at press time. India plans to achieve 175GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022 as part of its climate commitments; wherein it has promised to achieve 40% of its electricity generation capacity from non-fossil fuel based energy resources by 2030. This includes 60 GW from wind power, 100 GW from solar power, 10 GW from biomass and 5 GW from small hydro projects.While remaining hopeful, experts sounded caution on the 1000 MW wind energy project tender.Just as the solar tariffs have benefited from lower panel prices, wind tariffs will also optimise as the auction will create pricing pressure on WTG (wind turbine generator) suppliers. However, given that 70% of the bids are from Tamil Nadu, a high wind regime, the tariffs from this process should not be considered as a benchmark by lower wind regime states going forward. Overall, this is a good initiative and the sector will benefit from this auction, said Srishti Ahuja, director, at consulting firm EY.This comes at a time when the wind energy sector is grappling with issues such as squatters on good wind potential sites, inordinate delays in signing of power purchase agreements and untimely payments, and distribution firms shying away from procuring electricity generated from wind energy projects. The other pertinent issues are: proper scheduling and forecasting of wind energy, availability of transmission facilities and rationalisation of transmission tariffs for wind energy projects.The union government has called a national review meet of states and the nodal agencies for ironing out issues plaguing the green energy sector as reported by Mint on Friday(bit.ly/2iquTy0)India has a wind power potential of around 302 GW at 100 meter hub-height.",2017-01-16,uNn22FVohHnlCNsOtJz4EO,"The development may potentially bring down wind energy tariffs, which currently range from Rs3.9 per unit to Rs5.9 per unit, say experts",00:19,SECIs 1GW wind power tender sees high interest
-0.29,"The change in the US Federal Reserves dot plots that now suggest more rate hikes in 2017 doesnt seem to have made any material change to the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBI) monetary policy canvas.
				   
				Analysts still expect RBI to prune its repo rate in February by a quarter percentage point, and the monetary policy committee (MPC) will be only too happy to vote unanimously again.Such expectations are not misplaced as the repercussions of the currency withdrawal on the domestic economy are still emerging and, given the scale of the monetary shock, a policy rate cut will not look out of place.Growth is expected to get hit in the second half of 2016-17 as consumers bereft of cash curtail their spending. The tentative signs of this were seen in the purchasing managers index data for November which sank below 50, indicating a contraction.Though growth would be an important factor in the MPCs deliberations, the overriding element for RBI at every policy meet will be the flexible inflation target of 2-6%.Here too, there seems to be only good news.The headline retail inflation was 3.63% in October, lower than the central banks medium-term target of 4%, and the odds are that it will undershoot the 5% target for March. This is where the Feds future hikes will come to play.One channel through which they queer the pitch for RBI is capital flows. As dollar assets begin to generate more returns, a flight of capital from the emerging markets to the US is inevitable.Dollars have started to leave India already, and the pace could continue next year as well. The immediate fallout is a depreciating currency, something that India can ill-afford when global crude oil prices have begun to climb.India being a net importer, the implications of a weakening currency, along with rising oil prices, on inflation should not be overlooked. Recall that a falling rupee in fiscal 2012 and elevated crude oil prices ensured inflation became more entrenched in the following years.But so far, these trends are not really alarming. To start with, the rupee is expected to depreciate at worst by about 2% in 2017. With forex reserves beefed up, RBI can intervene in the market, too, and contain the rupees fall.Seldom are all the chips in place for monetary policy; but for now it seems the stage is set for a rate cut in February.

What is it? The approximate number of companies that had contended the right of states to impose entry tax (levy on movement of goods from one state to another).Why is it important? The Supreme Court on Friday ruled against these companies and upheld states rights to levy entry tax and said that this did not violate the principles of free trade. According to estimates, companies would have to reportedly pay Rs30,000-Rs35,000 crore in entry tax to states. The government is trying to roll out the goods and services tax, which is to subsume all indirect taxes (including the entry tax) in the country, by 1 April 2017 but this could be delayed by another six months.Tell me more: Companies including the Jindal Group, Vedanta, Tata Steel and Steel Authority of India had argued that the imposition of the entry tax by states on the movement of goods into their respective territories was against the right to freedom of trade and commerce in India, which is guaranteed under Article 301 of the Constitution.Rs2,500What is it? The cash withdrawal limit at ATMs per day, up from Rs2,000, as per a government notification.Why is it important? One of the consequences of the shock announcement of withdrawal of old currency notes in Rs500 and Rs1,000 denominations by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday has been the long queues outside bank branches and ATMs. The governments apparent lack of preparedness at dealing with the moves aftermath has been criticised and there have been instances of daily wage labourers losing out on their livelihoods, low-income workers struggling to get their hands on cash due to not having bank accounts or means/awareness to transact digitally.Tell me more: After a review by the finance ministry, the limit of old notes of Rs500 and Rs1,000 that can be exchanged with new notes of Rs2,000 and Rs500 have been increased from Rs4,000 to Rs4,500 per day. The weekly limit of withdrawal from bank accounts has been hiked to Rs24,000 from Rs20,000 and the limit of Rs10,000 has been removed.6What is it? The number of years of negotiations to arrive at a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement between India and Japan signed during Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit to Japan.Why is it important? This will help India buy nuclear technology from Japan and for Japan, it is its first civilian nuclear pact cooperation with a country (India) that has not signed the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. However, this exception has been made by Japan reportedly due to a separate note that says that it would suspend nuclear cooperation with India if it conducts a nuclear test, though unnamed Indian officials have insisted that this is not legally binding but only included keeping in mind Japanese sensitivities. This has raised apprehensions that this may lead to re-negotiations with other countries with whom India has signed nuclear pacts to insert similar clauses.Tell me more: Another clause in the note reportedly says that if Japan scraps the deal in the event of India conducting a nuclear test, the latter cannot ask for compensation for disruption of electricity from a nuclear plant or for the resultant economic losses. Japan is the only country to have suffered the impact of nuclear weapons being dropped on it and, therefore, has been uncomfortable signing such a pact with India, which is outside the nuclear non-proliferation regime.0.2%What is it? The expected increase in global carbon emissions above the 2015 levels from fossil fuels and industry in 2016, according to a study.Why is it important? This is the third straight year with an almost flat growth rate and a significant decline from the 3% recorded in the 2000s. One of the main reasons for this could be attributed to a decline in emissions by China and the US, the two largest emitters. Emissions by China and the US are expected to decrease by 0.5% (from 0.7% in 2015) and 17% (2.5% in 2015) this year, respectively. However, researchers said it is too early to say whether this is a temporary blip or the making of a long-term trend.Tell me more: Indias emissions, which were growing by 6% per annum over the last decade, slowed down to 5% in 2015 and such levels are expected to continue as it expects to double its coal production by 2020.$40.85 billionWhat is it? Asset sales by Indian companies pending or completed in 2016.Why is it important? This is the highest-ever asset sales by companies since liberalisation in 1991 and around 46% higher than the previous high of $27.96 billion recorded in 2007. This could be one of the main reasons why private investment has been muted in the recent past. While the 2007 asset sales were due to investors wanting a bigger pie of Indias growth story (its economy grew by 9% or more between 2005-06 and 2007-08), 2016 asset sales are due to the high debt levels of corporates.Tell me more: Some of the deals in 2016 include sale of controlling stake in Essar Oil to Russias Rosneft and its partners for nearly $13 billion and sale of Jaypee Groups cement assets to Aditya Birla-controlled UltraTech Cement for around $2.4 billion.howindialives.com is a search engine for public data",2016-11-14,uhljG1EgkoKTaCSia10yCP,"In other news, $40.85 billion is the highest-ever asset sales by companies since liberalisation in 1991",11:30,"News in Numbers | New withdrawal limit from ATMs is Rs2,500 per day "
0.07,"New Delhi: Information technology (IT) vendors are complaining about difficulties in executing government ordersfrom inflexible contactual terms to delays in paymentsalthough both the centre and states are farming out more work to IT companies.
				   
				Take, for instance, NIIT Technologies Ltd. In the June quarter, the firm reported a 47.5% fall in net profit due to a provision of Rs36 crore for dues it was yet to receive on a government contract, which been put on hold. The companys India business declined 7.2% sequentially in the quarter to September because it earned lower revenue from the government. India now accounts for just 7% of its total revenue.It (India business) impacts cash flow because it is very difficult to collect money from the Indian government... by defocusing on Indian government, we have been able to dramatically reduce the outstandings that we have to the cash flow, said Arvind Thakur, chief executive officer of NIIT Technologies.Both the central and state governments have stepped up spending on IT and e-governance projects. Rigidities built into requests for proposals (RFPs), which dont take into account the complexities involved in project execution, and delays in clearing invoices have offset the attractiveness of contracts.Payment terms and conditions tend to be skewed towards the end of the contract period. The problem worsens in case the project has a significant hardware component that has to be delivered and installed early on in the project life cycle, according to lobby National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom).Delayed payments create serious cash flow challenges for industry, especially smaller and medium IT vendors, and can make projects financially unviable.Day sales outstanding last year was typically between 85-90 days because of all the money stuck in domestic government projects. This quarter, it is 73 days because we reduced dependence on government. So, the entire cash position has changed dramatically, Thakur said. Day sales outstanding  refers to the average number of days that a company takes to collect revenue after a sale has been made.Indias third largest IT firm Wipro Ltd in September threatened to initiate legal proceedings against the Employees State Insurance Corp. (ESIC), a government entity, due to non-payment of dues. The company entered into a seven-year contract in 2009 with ESIC as a system integrator to set up a health administration programme for Rs1,200 crore. Wipro has completed its obligations under the contract. However, ESIC has withheld certain amounts due to Wipro in an ad-hoc and arbitrary manner, which has resulted in significant delay in collections for Wipro, the company said in a filing to the BSE on 7 SeptemberWipro did not respond to emailed questions.

Although the non-performing loan ratio of commercial banks rose to 1.81%,  the overall financial system remained stable with no systemic financial risk. Overall debt ratio of central and local governments stood at around 40%, which is quite low when compared with developed countries. The fiscal deficit rate was only 3%, still under the internationally recognized safety limit. The process of reducing capacity has already begun in iron and steel, and coal industries. The aim is to reduce production of crude steel by 45 million tonnes (mt) and of coal by 2.5 mt this year. Production of crude steel and coal will be reduced by 100-to-150 mt and 500-to-800 mt, respectively, in the next five years. This de-capacity process is aimed at improving the economic and energy structure of the Chinese economy, so that 1.3 billion Chinese people can lead a healthier life in a cleaner and greener environment. China is fully capable of achieving 6.5-7% growth this year, and its contribution to the worlds economic growth will remain around 25%. The new round of economic reforms, rapid urbanization, technological progress, improvement in quality of labour and deepening of international economic cooperation will support Chinas medium- to high-speed economic growth in the long run.However, owing to the large size of the Chinese economy and some structural, cyclical and external factors, the transformation and upgradation of Chinas economic development pattern will require more time. The country faces many difficulties in the task of promoting economic restructuring and upgrading, and even more difficulties in fulfilling the responsibility of boosting world economic growth.The good news, nonetheless, is that this year India is still the third largest engine pulling the world economy forward. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has focused on economic reforms and economic development since taking office, and launched many encouraging plans such as Make in India, Smart Cities and Startup India. He has travelled far and wide within India and visited various countries around the world. He is perceived as actively promoting economic cooperation between India and the rest of the world. The business environment in India has also witnessed improvement, and foreign investments have increased significantly; infrastructure has gained momentum, fiscal consolidation has strengthened, and inflation has come down. India, like China a few decades ago, is seeing the setting up of industrial parks, construction of new skyscrapers every day, and a continuous forward extension of railways and roads. India has remained the fastest-growing major economy in the world for the last two years. On the back of a great monsoon, this year is going to be a bumper year for Indians. Timely monsoon and bumper crops would help India achieve 8% GDP (gross domestic product) growth as hoped by finance minister Arun Jaitley. It would increase Indias GDP by nearly $180 billion, which may be only about $100 billion less than the increment of the US economy. It deserves mention that India has firmly taken over the role of the third engine driving global economic growth.During a meeting, Jayant Prasad, director general of the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, told Liu Jinsong, charge daffaires of the Chinese embassy, that our confidence in the future of Chinas economy is just like that in our own economic outlook. In the present era of profound economic globalization, our big world has turned into a small global village where the fate of every country is so closely intertwined with anothers that no one can go it alone. The Chinese and Indian economies are highly complementary to each other as reflected through increasing number of cooperation projects. Indias growing economy is actually helpful in easing the downward pressure on Chinas economy. Only if China and India help each other and forge ahead can they bring hope to themselves in a very depressed world economy and illuminate the world as well. It is always better to have more engines powering the worlds economic growth.

0.6,"Bengaluru: Amazon.com Inc. has indicated it would keep pumping money into India although its investments in the country crimped profitability at the worlds largest online retailer for the second quarter in a row. 
				   
				Amazons chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky said in a conference call with analysts on Thursday that the e-commerce giant was encouraged by its progress in India and the response it has received from consumers. He acknowledged that the investment in India continues to be  large.What you are seeing is the continuation of the step-up investment that we saw in the second half of last year...We also have investments in other Prime benefits from Prime Now to AmazonFresh and of course we are continuing to invest in Alexa and our Echo devices. And finally, I guess, Id point out India which continues to be a rather large investment for us, said Olsavsky. In the three months ended December, Amazon posted international sales of about $14 billion, and its loss widened to $487 million from $108 million a year ago, mainly due to the online marketplaces investments in India. Amazon posted an operating loss of about $541 million from its international business in the September quarter. Amazon has committed to investing at least $5 billion in India over the next few years. According to recent regulatory filings, Amazon has so far invested over Rs7,000 crore (a little over $1 billion) into its Indian operations, with a recent capital infusion of about Rs2,000 crore.Its still very early (in India). We continue to say that, but we are very encouraged with what weve created with customers and sellers alike in India over the last few years.... We will continue to build our business there and continue to do a great job for both customers and sellers. Were bullish on India longer-term and its early, said Olsavsky. Interestingly, Amazon also said that it had not witnessed any major impact on sales due to the November invalidation of high-value currency notes by the Indian government. Demonetization had an impact on all online retailers in the weeks following the move and caused a widespread slowdown in online shopping, as the cash ban put off consumers in a country where a majority of shoppers still use cash for day-to-day transactions.Experts tracking Amazons ambitious moves in India said that while Amazon is currently losing money due to heavy investments in India, the Seattle-based e-commerce based giant is looking at the long-term potential of the market and would not mind spending a few extra billions of dollars to conquer an important Internet market like India. See, Amazon knows that theyve got into a 10-15-year play with India, at the very least. For (Amazon founder) Jeff Bezos, this is a bit of an ego battlesince he lost out big-time in China, he feels he cant afford to have a repeat of that in India and so, hes prepared to do whatever it takes to conquer India, said Rutvik Doshi, director at the India arm of Inventus Capital Partners.For Amazon, in the long run of a 20-year horizon, $10-15 billion of investment is nothingfor a company that has a market cap of $350-400 billion, thats just a drop in the ocean, he added.In a separate development, Amazon has sought Indian government approval for online retailing of food products produced and manufactured in India, proposing to invest about Rs3,400 crore, PTI reported, citing people it didnt identify. The application is being considered by the commerce and industry ministry, the report said.We are excited by the governments continued efforts to encourage FDI (foreign direct investment) in India for a stronger food supply chain.

0.24,"Singapore: Japan Inc. is getting a raw deal in India. Some of its high-profile investments in the country have created more wealth for arbitration lawyers in London and Singapore than they have for shareholders. Those who were expecting great things from the bromance between Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi have reasons to be disappointed.
				   
				Two soured deals are NTT Docomo Inc.s $2.2 billion investment in an Indian wireless venture with the Tata Group, and the $4.6 billion Daiichi Sankyo Co. shelled out to buy Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd, a generic drugmaker. Almost a decade on, the Japanese companies have won claims to compensation via international arbitration proceedings, but in neither case is there any sign of a check in the mail.The Docomo dispute might be quicker to resolve. Ratan Tata, who recently reclaimed control of the conglomerate in a boardroom putsch, is reportedly keen to settle. It was he who had promised to buy out Docomo at a 50% loss on its original investment in five years.But when the Japanese tried to exercise their put option in 2014, the Indian group contended that in local law, a guaranteed exit price would become unwelcome foreign debt masquerading as equity, therefore, the Tatas could neither honour their commitment, nor fulfil the arbitration award the Japanese company won last year in London.ALSO READ: Tata-Mistry ties strained further with Tata Motors 2015 rights issue: AffidavitDaiichi Sankyos misery began when it acquired Ranbaxy from brothers Malvinder Singh and Shivinder Singh in 2008. Shortly after, US regulators barred more than 30 drugs made at two of the Indian companys plants and also halted reviews of new products at one of the factories because the company had falsified data. In May last year, the Singapore International Arbitration Centre awarded Daiichi a $376 million claim against the Singh brothers for suppressing facts, which had cost Ranbaxy an expensive settlement with the US regulator. Japan Inc.s total outbound mergers and acquisitions (M&A) last year stood at $79.7 billion.That victory doesnt mean much. The siblings are contending that the Singapore award is invalid under Indian law. Daiichi, which has already exited India at a loss, is now hoping the courts there will stop the Singh brothers from selling a stake in their hospital chain Fortis Healthcare Ltd before settling their claim. Earlier this month, Mint reported that KKR & Co. was in talks with the brothers to buy Fortis, which has an enterprise value of $1.5 billion. In a new twist, Daiichi claims it just found out that one of the Singh brothers investment companies it sued to recover the money from no longer exists.The longer such wrangles linger, the stronger the impression that Indias local laws make it impossible to settle commercial disputes with foreigners. Japanese firms arent the most ambitious of dealmakers in emerging markets anyway. Their total acquisitions in Brazil, Russia, India and China have amounted to just $25 billion over the past six years, of which Indias share has been $4.4 billion. By contrast, American companies spent $5.1 billion shopping in India last year.Abe wants the coyness to end and hopes for a big role in Indias railway modernization. However, for long-gestation infrastructure projects, sanctity of contract enforcement will be even more important. New Delhis tax regime is already a minefield.

0.55,"San Francisco: I built a chatbot. It can only do a handful of things, and its even dumber than the average chatbot. But it works, and I can talk to it through Facebook Messenger. More importantly, Im not a coder.
				   
				Some of the worlds largest technology companies are banking on a future where people will send text messages to airlines, banks, restaurants or stores and receive automated responses. Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corp., IBM and Tencent each held events this year centered around promoting their bot-related initiatives to software makers. Twitter Inc. introduced chatbot-like functions with Pizza Hut and other brands on Tuesday to field customer service inquiries.Many are betting these tools will soon be everywhere, with bot avatars for pop stars and mom-and-pop shops. (The band Kiss already has one.) For that bot-filled future to unfold, several startups are hoping to enable anyonenot just software developersto build a bot.The latest is Octane AI, which raised $1.5 million from General Catalyst and other investors. It joins Chatfuel, Olabot and Motion.ai, all of which have either raised money or rolled out their DIY-chatbot tools in the past year. They let people choose from a list of basic commands and edit scripted responses. Some generate revenue through subscriptions.The race among these startups heated up in April, when Facebook made chatbots available to Messengers billion-plus users. Facebook has said there are more than 30,000 chatbots available through its app. In September, Google bought Api.ai, a service that helps developers build bots.Making chatbots accessible to people who cant code is going to be a way a lot of businesses end up building their first few bots, said Phil Libin, a partner at General Catalyst. He compared these nascent bot-building tools with Squarespace Inc. or Wix.com Ltd., which make it easy to build a website.The chatbots you can create with these services are fairly rudimentary. If the bot sees a word or phrase it doesnt recognize or doesnt have an answer for, the conversation hits a dead end. To keep the chatter flowing, many chatbots act like an automated phone system: They nudge users to pick from a small set of responses, displayed as buttons. In most cases, you cant press 0 to get an operator.Its very important to set expectations, said Dmitry Dumik, whose company Chatfuel powers news-delivering chatbots for the New York Times and TechCrunch. You cant have a chatbot like in the movie Her.Octane co-founder Matt Schlicht is optimistic that bots will someday become more useful and benefit from advancements in artificial intelligence. When the iPhone first came out, we had things like the fart app, said Schlicht. Were in the fart app stage with bots.Schlichts startup is targeting brands with loyal followings for its chatbot builder. Octane recently teamed up with 50 Cent to answer messages sent to his Facebook page. The rappers bot can help fans do a few things, such as buying a G-Unit hat or signing up for updates from the musician. If you ask it a question it doesnt know how to answer, the bot simply replies: whats up fam.People message these Facebook pages all the time, and for the most part, no one responds, and the message goes into a black hole, said Schlicht. Its a huge missed opportunity.There are build-your-own chatbot tools that try to replicate dead people, and others that cater to the living. Olabot lets users create a bot version of themselves in minutes just by talking to it. The end result functions as a kind of social profile: Users can link their Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Medium and Spotify accounts, and then answer multiple-choice questions about their interests and views, such as, Would you rather talk about relationships or politics? The goal, according to Olabot CEO Esther Crawford: It should be as easy as creating an Instagram account. Bloomberg",2016-11-03,w1EyIubK0fuxqHzMXKumKP,Some of the worlds largest technology companies are betting on a chatbot future.

0.3,"New Delhi: Banks will open additional counters and work extra hours beginning Thursday to help people exchange Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes that have been declared invalid from midnight on Tuesday. Anticipating panic and rush at bank counters, the Reserve Bank of India  (RBI) as well as the government has set up control rooms in Mumbai and Delhi to avoid any crisis, Department of Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das said. 
				   
				Banks will remain shut on Wednesday to allow stocking of smaller currency notes and public will be allowed to tender their now invalid Rs 500 and Rs 1000 from November 10. They can deposit any amount of the invalid currency in their bank account till December 30 and also exchange them for lower banknotes at special counters at banks and post offices till November 24 but with limit of Rs 4,000 in a day. Banks will however report any unusual transaction to the Financial Intelligence Unit and tax authorities for scrutiny. RBI Governor Urjit Patel said the central bank had ramped up production of the new higher security currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 that will replace the notes being taken out of circulation. The new notes will come into circulation from November 10, he said. He linked the government decision to use high denomination currency notes for terrorism financing and also for holding black money. While overall currency circulation had increased by 40 per cent during 2011 to 2016, Rs 500 banknotes in circulation had gone up by 76 per cent and that of Rs 1000 by 109 per cent. As many as 16.5 billion notes of Rs 500 denomination are in circulation currently while 6.7 billion Rs 1,000 notes are in market. While the government imposed strict cash withdrawal limits - Rs 2000 from ATMs and Rs 10,000 from bank account in a day and Rs 20,000 in a week, Patel said there will be no impact on liquidity in the markets including financial markets. The cash withdrawal limits will be relaxed gradually as small currency denomination notes are adequately stocked with banks and ATMs and new currency notes come into wide circulation.

0.79,"After Max Financial Services Ltd announced its swap ratio with HDFC Life Insurance Ltd last month, the formers shares now reflect the value of the combined entity. As such, investors can already get a clean, direct exposure to one of the countrys largest insurance plays through Max. Even so, there has been a fair bit of excitement around the insurance sector, and even though ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd may have lost the first-mover advantage to HDFC, its initial public offering (IPO) is expected to be received well.
				   
				To start with, it has been valued at a 10-20% discount to the HDFC-Max combine, according to calculations by Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd. At the price band of Rs300-324 per share, the life insurer is valued at Rs43,060-47,957 crore. Nomura Securities puts the insurers embedded value (EV) for fiscal year 2018 at Rs17,520 crore and the IPO price would be a multiple of 2.5-2.7 times estimated FY18 EV.Recall that the merger of HDFC Life-Max Life Ltd last month had valued HDFC Life at Rs45,687 crore and the merged entity at Rs66,508 crore. Analysts peg the FY18 EV of the merged company at Rs21,290 crore that puts the transaction at a multiple of 3.5 of EV. But Nomuras analysts say that after adjusting for cost synergies expected from the HDFC Life-Max merger and after excluding excess capital, ICICI Prudentials valuations are at 2.9-3.2 times EV, and HDFC-Maxs valuation stands at 3.6 times.Note that ICICI Prudential has the highest proportion of revenue coming from unit-linked insurance plans (Ulips)they account for 82% of its new business premium. Ulips are cyclical and so some of the key ratios could be prone to its vagaries. Analysts at Nomura also note that ICICI Prudentials new business profit is lower than peers that have bank-led insurance models. Besides, a relatively low proportion of its premium is related to the protection business, which also results in lower margins. As such, its not surprising that the ICICI Prudential IPO has been priced much cheaper vis-à-vis the HDFC-Max combine. Also note that when juxtaposed with the earlier stake sale of ICICI Bank to Temasek and PremjiInvest, its valuations look dearer. ICICI Bank sold a 6% stake for around Rs1,950 crore valuing the insurer at Rs32,500 crore. This is at a multiple of 1.85 of the FY18 EV. As pointed earlier, what will help from a demand perspective is that insurance penetration in India is still low. Premium as a percentage of gross domestic product was a mere 2.7% in calendar year 2015. The potential is there for private insurers to milk this opportunity.",2016-09-14,w5NYbmQwG5jHMVJSXtOE0N,"Even though ICICI Prudential Life Insurance may have lost the first-mover advantage to HDFC, its IPO is expected to be received well",00:52,ICICI Prudentials IPO: A good bet on insurance
0.82,"The largest venture capital fund ever raised by a woman isnt in Silicon Valley or even the US. Its in Beijing and is run by a former librarian who keeps such a low profile that shes a mystery in her native China. Chen Xiaohong rarely attends industry conferences or events. She hadnt given a media interview in more than a decade until agreeing to break her silence this summer. I dont like being part of a club, said Chen during a four-hour discussion at her firms headquarters. I believe in staying independent, making your own decisions.
				   
				Chen, 46, is part of an unusual group of female investors who have risen to the top of the venture business in China and helped fuel the countrys technology boom. Theyve backed some of Chinas most successful start-ups and their influence is growing as they raise more money, recruit other women and seed the next generation of technology companies.Chen and her peers have become part of the mainstream in China in a way thats proven elusive in the US American venture firms have faced accusations of sexism and discrimination for years, including in an unsuccessful lawsuit filed by a female partner against storied Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Despite the criticism, the firms have made little progress in promoting women. Among the top US venture firms, women make up about 10% of the investing partners and only half of the firms have any women of that rank. China is already more balanced: About 17% of investing partners are female and 80% have at least one woman.An increasing number, like Chen, lead their firms. Kathy Xu is founder of Shanghais Capital Today Group, which has $1.2 billion under management and was an early backer of the e-commerce company JD.com Inc. Anna Fang is CEO of ZhenFund, one of the most influential angel investors in China. Ruby Lu, Chens partner at her firm H Capital until this month, previously co-founded the China business for Doll Capital Management. Their success is bringing more women into Chinas technology industry. The Chinese government estimates females found 55% of new Internet companies and more than a quarter of all entrepreneurs are women. In the US, only 22% of start-ups have one or more women on their founding teams, according to research by Vivek Wadhwa and Farai Chideya for their book Innovating Women: The Changing Face of Technology. Chen and her colleagues are building on a tradition of opportunity for women in China that dates back to before the days when Mao Zedong declared they held up half the sky. Women worked out of necessity in fields and factories when the country was poor, and fought alongside men during the countrys civil war. By comparison, collaborating in an office is simple. Lus mother, who served in the Peoples Liberation Army, laughed when she heard about her daughters diversity training at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. She said Thats ridiculous. Whats your job got to do with women or men? The country is hardly free from discrimination. Men still hold most positions of power in politics and business, and theres plenty of crude sexism in technology. But China has quietly become one of the best places in the world for women venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. Chen raised a new $500 million fund, the biggest ever by a woman, according to Preqin, and increased her assets under management to about $1 billion. The largest women-led fund in the US was about half that size, according to Preqins data.China is fundamentally different, said Gary Rieschel, an American who founded the China-based Qiming Venture Partners, where four of the nine investing partners are female. The venture capital industry in the U.S. has been a private mens club. It has been much more of a meritocracy for women in China. H Capital is based in a modern tower in the northeast corner of Beijing overlooking the new diplomatic district. The airy offices have wood floors and white brick walls, and a more casual vibe than the firms on Sand Hill Road in Silicon Valley. One wall is decorated with a framed charcoal drawing of a menacing-looking robot by one of Chens children.Chen agreed to an interview after prodding from Lu, her former partner. Despite Chens penchant for privacy, Lu argued that women have the best chance to excel by helping each other and sharing experiences of victory and defeat. They sank into brightly coloured bean bag chairs, where the partners usually meet with entrepreneurs and investors, and talked over fresh-cut watermelon and mineral water. I like to bring everyone down to floor level, joked Lu.Chen was hardly destined for greatness. She grew up in Hubei Province, in a city famous for its gymnasts. Her parents, a high school teacher and an accountant, were neither rich nor politically connected. She was nonetheless a gifted student who got into Chinas top university and won a rare full scholarship for graduate school in America, the chance for a better life.She nearly blew it. Lonely and homesick, she abandoned the prestigious grant to join Chinese friends at Rutgers University in New Jersey. The only course available was in library science, so she studied to be a librarian. In my heart, I knew I wouldnt be an academic, Chen said.After finishing her degree, Chen answered a help wanted ad in the New York Times for a librarian at the New York media merchant bank Veronis Suhler Stevenson LLC in 1994. She got the job and in those early Internet days she managed file cabinets full of corporate records. Her meticulous company reports soon drew the attention of CEO John Suhler. She added new meaning to the word diligent and to the words due diligence, said Suhler. She was better than any of our MBA associates.Chen was called XC because her colleagues didnt understand the order of Chinese names and she was reticent to correct them. Suhler eventually promoted her to work on deals. He kept sending me requests after hed read a clip in the paper, Chen said. She was the only Chinese woman at the firm.It has been much more of a meritocracy for women in ChinaChen gained confidence as she gained experience. She worked on some 45 publishing and education deals, and was promoted again, this time to managing director. She met Tiger Global founder Chase Coleman in 2003 through mutual connections. He originally recruited her to work at a Chinese e-commerce company he had invested in called Joyo.com. It turned out that Joyo.coms CEO was her old high school classmate Lei Jun, who would later become one of the most successful entrepreneurs in Asia as founder of Xiaomi Corp. She returned to China in February 2004 to help the company raise money, but the plans changed when the board decided to sell to Amazon.com Inc.Still, Coleman saw Chens potential. They began discussions for her to launch an investment fund specializing in education. Even before she was formally hired, she hit the road to meet with about 70 companies. In October 2004, she officially joined Tiger.It was an opportune time. China under Communist rule had shunned capitalist practices like private business and Wall Street-style finance. But Deng Xiaoping led a wave of market reforms in the 1980s and with the dot-com boom at the turn of the century, entrepreneurs and venture investors were scrambling to make their fortunes. Few Chinese had been trained in finance, men or women, so the field was wide open for Chen and her peers. When China got going, there just werent that many people, said Qimings Rieschel.One of Chens first investments in 2004 was in New Oriental Education & Technology Group, a provider of test preparation and foreign language courses that was looking to expand. Chens college English professor helped start the company and she saw the prospects for private education in China. My whole generation was basically mentored by New Oriental, she said. New Oriental went public in 2006 and the shares quadrupled in a year. She had made her first fortune at Tiger.Xiaohong is a terrific investor, said Coleman in an email. Her capacity to navigate the Chinese investment landscape and its many nuances is second to none.She also invested in JD.com when it was an upstart in the shadow of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Sensing the companys margins could grow sharply if they reached a large enough scale, she agreed to a valuation that surprised the tech community. Everyone thought we were crazy, everyone thought they would die, she said. When we looked at it we saw only potential. E-commerce is a pure economies of scale game.Through it all, she raised three children. Her work habits would have been unusual, if not unacceptable, in the West. She brought her first-born son to the office every day for three years. She didnt have a nanny or a helper so he came to virtually every meeting she had, crawling on conference tables and scribbling on walls. She says that bringing her children helped build a bond with many of the entrepreneurs she backed. Her son did cry and disrupt meetings, but that didnt stop her. It gave her a chance to develop a more personal relationship with founders.She thinks being a woman gave her another advantage: It was easier for her to tell an entrepreneur he was wrong than a male investor. Its very politically incorrect to say this, but as a woman I can say things, they do show a special respect for women. Because its seen as motherly, you can be much more stern.There were many role models, which was helpful when I started a familyChen has set an example thats made an impact on younger generations. For me, there were many role models, which was helpful when I started a family and was worried about how to manage being a mom and running a fund, said Fang of ZhenFund. Fang points to Chen as one of the models that convinced her she could balance the rigorous demands of her job with the role of being a mother.Now, as these women rise through the ranks of venture capital and private equity, they are working to make sure more can follow in their footsteps. Fangs nine-member investment team has four women and theyve put money into more than 30 start-ups founded or co-founded by women.

The letter came to light through news reports.He also mentioned in the letter that LeEco would begin cost-cutting programmes, reduce subsidies for customers and focus on existing businesses instead of new ones.We will focus on China, America and India and achieve breakthroughs in these three valuable regional markets, Jia wrote in the letter.Jia, who founded Leshi Internet Information and Technology in 2004, started by selling content streaming services to the Chinese and entered the smart TV business in 2013 and the smartphone market in 2015.He borrowed against his shares in Leshi for cash that he invested into his other companies, and said in the letter that the scale of external fund-raising had trouble satisfying the demands of rapid expansion, according to a 7 November Bloomberg report.LeEco, which entered India early this year, has been steadily investing in the country to replicate its model in China, where it not only sells the hardware, but services as a subscription, too.It currently sells smartphones, smart TVs and mobile accessories in India.By April, the company had opened a research and development centre in Bengaluru and said it would have about 1,000 people by the end of the year.It also said it would invest $10 million to build cloud infrastructure for delivering content in India.",2016-11-11,wM1GsKUclk0VdMI3aROwKI,"India represents the future and its user value may surpass China in a few years, says LeEco chairman Jia",00:33,Cash-strapped LeEco looks to India as primary market that will drive growth
0.41,"Washington/New Delhi: Putting the heat on countries like India that corner substantial numbers of H1B and L1 work visas issued to IT professionals, senator Jeff Sessions, US president-elect Donald Trumps nominee for the post of attorney general, overnight, on Thursday said the new administration would push for legislative measures to curb the misuse of the two categories of visas. 
				   
				The comments come as Trump, in his first news conference as president-elect on Wednesday, promised a major punitive border tax on products manufactured by US companies shifting jobs outside the US, underlining that job creation at home would be one of his priorities.Previously, the US president-elect had listed immigration reform among five executive actions he plans to take on his first day in office. They include asking the Department of Labor to investigate all abuses of the visa programmes that undercut the American worker.Also read: The challenges to free movement of labourIn his confirmation hearing, Sessions said: Its simply wrong to think that were in a totally open world and that any American with a job can be replaced if somebody in the world is willing to take a job for less pay. We have borders. We have a commitment to our citizens and you have been a champion of that. Ive been honoured to work with you on it, Sessions said in response to a question from senator Charles Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.Under the H1B visa programme, US-based companies hire highly skilled foreign workers, up to a maximum of 85,000 a year65,000 hired abroad and 20,000 from among foreign nationals studying in the US.The H1B visas are used by companies hiring Indian techies while the L1 is used for intra-company transfers.  The multibillion-dollar Indian IT industrys exports are worth $108 billion, 60% of which goes to the US market.Also read: Trump effect? Bill targeting H1B visas reintroduced in US CongressIn New Delhi, Shivendra Singh, vice-president in charge of global trade development at the National Association of Software and Services Companies or Nasscom, said the trade body would work to dispel the perception that Indian IT professionals were eating into the US jobs market. The top seven Indian companies account for just 13% of the H1B and L1 visas issued every year, he said, adding that the rest are used by major US companies who hire Indian IT professionals.The fact is that the Indian IT sector is a net jobs creator in the US, Singh said. We support more than 400,000 jobs in the US, we contribute $20 billion as taxes to the US economy and we play a role in making America more competitive, he said.  Singh also cited the US Labor Department figures to buttress the argument that a shortage of skilled workers within the US labour pool was what was causing Indian as well as US companies to hire Indian IT professionals. According to Singh, the US Labor Department had itself predicted a shortage of 2.4 million STEM or science, technology, engineering and mathematics graduates till 2018. We want to hire locally but there is a shortage of skilled labour. This is why US companies are also hiring Indian workers, he said.If the H1B and LI visas are given on the basis of skill, then we are fine with that, he said. We are also supportive of US efforts to create more jobs, he said.With the US and India looking to boost trade from the current $100 billion to $500 billion (set by India and the US during a visit to New Delhi in 2013 by the outgoing US vice-president Joe Biden), Singh said the IT industry was seen as one of the key drivers of this.The Indian IT industry has in the past too been a target of  US politicians who blame it for taking away jobs.In 2015, during US president Barack Obamas second term in office, India had protested the increase in H1B and L1 visa fees from $2000 and $2,500 respectively to $4000 and $4500 respectively. The steep hikes were justified by the US administration to finance more security posts on the US-Mexico border and for the creation of a special fund for the victims of the 9/11 attacks in the US in 2001.Sessionss comments on the H1B and L1 visas come as two Republican lawmakers from California on 5 January re-introduced a bill in the US Congress that backs  key changes in the H1B programme, news reports said.  Among other things, the bill aims to increase the minimum salary of H1B visa to $100,000 per annum from the current levels of $60,000 per annum.",2017-01-12,wM8JqbZmNrXXGeeLMjYD5J,Jeff Sessions assures US lawmakers of taking steps to curb misuse of H1B visassignificantly used by Indiazn IT professionals that allegedly replace US workers,12:08,H1B visas under scrutiny as Team Trump vows crack down on misuse
0.34,"Mumbai/New Delhi: Tata Motors Ltd on Monday posted a quarterly profit but missed the analysts earnings estimates by a wide margin because of currency hedging losses at its UK Jaguar Land Rover unit following the nations decision to leave the European Union.
				   
				The Mumbai-based company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs848 crore in the three months ended 30 September compared with a loss of Rs1,740 crore in the year-ago period. The company still missed the Rs2,758.3 crore profit estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 24 analysts.Tata Motors said that higher sales volume at its Jaguar Land Rover unit was offset by the realized hedging losses of  Rs3,510 crore and adverse commodity derivatives impact of Rs187 crore.The Brexit effect has led to unintended losses for the last two quarters on the companys hedges, said Mahantesh Sabarad, deputy head of research (equity), SBI Cap Securities Ltd. Hedging losses on the account of Jaguar Land Rover was £123 million (about Rs1,050 crore) during the preceding June quarter.Fiscal second-quarter consolidated revenue grew by 6.94% to Rs67,000 crore, in line with analysts estimates of Rs67,061.4 crore.The numbers reflect strong sales of Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles across all its markets in the UK, Europe, North America, China and other markets, the company said.The performance of its India business deteriorated further because of a decline in sales of its medium and heavy commercial vehicles. Tata Motorss loss, excluding its units, widened to Rs631 crore during the quarter from Rs289 crore in the year earlier. Revenue of the standalone business also declined to Rs11,406 crore in the September quarter from Rs11,794 crore in the year-ago period.This comes despite the company reporting higher sales in segments such as light commercial vehicles, passenger vehicles and exports.Passenger vehicles sales grew 20.5% from a year earlier, while car sales rose 26.4% because of demand for its recently launched Tiago model. Exports grew 20.1% from a year earlier. These were more than offset by degrowth of 16.5% y-o-y in the M&HCV segment, the company said in a statement.Led by the introduction of new models and a pick-up in China sales, volumes at the companys UK subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover grew 29.3% to 142,459 units, reflecting strong sales of the Discovery, Discovery Sport, Evoque, XE and the new F-Pace. Retail sales grew across all key regions. North American sales rose 39%, the UK 28%, China 49% and Europe 31%, the company said.Tatas profit margin may improve in coming quarters as a lower British pound starts to buoy translated revenue from overseas sales, according to Steve Man, senior industry analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Production of two Land Rover SUVs by the joint venture with Chinas Chery is ramping up and should aid margin expansion, Man said.

0.25,"Mumbai:  The Tata group fracas appears to have shed all earthly inhibitions and gone to a galaxy far, far away. In this Star Wars space opera, Cyrus Mistry, the recently ousted chairman, was Sith Lord Darth Vader who had brainwashed the PR folk  the old and venerable conglomerates noble Jedi warriors  and used them to smother criticism of his performance.
				   
				Thats probably why a 24 September Economist report, titled Mistrys Elephant, which was denounced by the group for drawing preconceived conclusions based on an inappropriate interpretation of selected data, was on Thursday extolled by the same people for being really a well-balanced and critical review.Not just that. Thursdays press statement ticked off the groups PR machineryin other words, itselffor dismissing views that did not toe the line being peddled by Bombay House, Tatas headquarters. Even the author of the Economist report is baffled by the sudden change of heart.Stanley Pignal @spignal Im fascinated to see Tata denouncing its own PR machines response to my recent article. Odd given PR side is/was https://t.co/gCbxA6z7EB Twitter: Stanley Pignal on TwitterAs for investors who have seen more than $12 billion of their Tata group wealth vanish since 24 October, the day Ratan Tata reclaimed control, only three questions really matter:Whos the Chosen One to restore balance to the Force? How many episodes are left? Wheres the popcorn?The answer to the first is far from obvious. Ratan Tatas camp is now accusing Mistry of trying to hijack control of operating companies in the $100 billion salt-to-software conglomerate. Mistrys side says the allegations are untrue. Tata is mocking Mistrys poor leadership for botching up Tata Steel Ltds UK operations, claiming that the Scunthorpe steel plant it sold in May to Greybull Capital LLP for 1 British pound has since seen a dramatic turnaround. Mistry, on the other hand, blames Ratan Tatas $12.9 billion purchase of Corus Group Plcs steel assets in 2007 for the groups debt overhang.Tata Consultancy share-price declined 13% since Ratan returned . Since Ratan Tata is back only in an interim capacity, the group needs a new chairman to end the spat. But until Mistry agrees to sell his familys 18.4% holding in Tata Sons Ltd., the holding company, the lightsabers wont get turned off. Its unlikely that the CEO of a global corporation would want to jump into the fray as Luke Skywalkerand get his or her reputation fried in the process. Besides, after Tata Groups press statement accused Mistry of dismantling structures put in place by visionary founders and generations of Tatas, its not even clear if the group wants to be anything other than a family-run enterprise.Its a much more than just a war of words. Ratan Tata is trying to evict Mistry from the boards of operating companies, but its proving to be far from easy thanks to a few independent directors whore supporting Mistry. But are those directors taking up the cudgels to uphold corporate governance standards, or are they simply trying to avoid the embarrassment of firing a chairman after showering praises on him?Like in everything else with the Tata Wars, its impossible to establish whos with the Force and whos gone over to the Dark Side. Or for that matter, how many more episodes are left in the sordid saga. The best investors can hope for is that until the group makes up its mind on whether it wants to slash debt, gun for growth, or do a bit of both, Tata Consultancy Services , the groups ATM, will keep coughing up more cash so Bombay House can fully engage in the tussle for control.

0.26,"Mumbai: ICICI Bank Ltd on Thursday cut interest rates on home loans by 15 basis points (bps), setting off a rate war in the home finance market.
				   
				The bank cut the interest rate on home loans up to Rs 75 lakh to 9.20% from 9.35% for male customers. The interest rate for women has been lowered to 9.15% from 9.30%. For underprivileged customers, loans up to Rs25 lakh have been repriced to 9.15% from 9.30% earlier. The new rates became applicable starting 1 November, the bank said in a notification on its website.One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. The reduction in home loan rates follows ICICI Banks 10 bps rate cut in the one-year marginal cost based lending rate (MCLR), reduced to 8.95% on 28 October.ALSO READ | This or that: floating rate or fixed rate for a home loan?The private sector lenders move is in response to the new home loan rates announced by State Bank of India (SBI).Indias largest lender has cut its home loan rate to 9.15%, a cut of about 15 bps. Home loan rates for SBIs women customers has been dropped to 9.1%.The new rates are being offered under SBIs festive season offer. The state-owned bank is also offering a waiver on processing fees on home loans for customers who want to buy SBI approved projects and are applying online, those who want to transfer their home loans to the bank, and certain government employees.The housing finance market is currently dominated by SBI, which had a home loan portfolio worth Rs1.97 trillion, as on 30 June. In comparison, ICICI Bank had a home loan portfolio worth Rs1.13 trillion at the end of the first quarter.ALSO READ | Banks cut lending and deposit ratesAccording to Sumit Bali, senior executive vice-president and head-personal assets at Kotak Mahindra Bank, lenders have been passing on the benefit of falling interest rates in the system to their retail and small and medium enterprises (SME) customers over the last few months and the festive season should see more such offers coming up.Between August and September, Kotak Mahindra Bank ran a special monsoon offer where it waived processing fees for home loan customers who were also given an interest rate of 9.35% on their new loans. According to Bali, the bank may look at reintroducing these offers, depending on market conditions. Our six-month MCLR, which is the basic rate on which we price our home loans, is at about 9.2%. Presently, we are charging a premium of about 5 bps and we can reduce it to nil, depending on the customer profile. We wouldnt want to lose our customers over a 5-10 bps difference, he added.As experts see it, lenders will be using festive season demand as a means to prop up their lending portfolios which have been growing slowly over the most of this financial year. As of now, lenders are being quite selective in announcing festive offers. As corporate loan growth has been lagging for many quarters now, home finance seems to be the safest growth option for banks. Whether these rate reductions would go beyond the festive season, will determine if we are in a rate war- type situation, said Karthik Srinivasan, senior vice-president and co-head of financial sector ratings firm Icra Ltd.According to fortnightly data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), as on 14 October, the outstanding non-food credit for the banking system was reported at Rs72.7 trillion, showing only a 9% year-on-year growth.In comparison, home loans have been showing a growth of at least 18-20% year-on-year for the past many months and stood at over Rs8 trillion at the end of September, RBI data shows.

				Lower lending rates have long been seen as a needed boost to Indias economy, which grew at a 15-month low in the April-June quarter, in part due to a dearth of corporate investment.Tuesdays withdrawal of Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes, aimed at curbing corruption and counterfeit currency, has sparked long lines of people looking to exchange their worthless notes.State Bank of India (SBI), Indias largest lender by assets, said on Friday it had already received Rs18,000 crore ($2.68 billion) in savings and current account deposits since Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the measure.Also Read: Why are ATMs still out of service and out of cash ?Economists at SBI estimate banks will receive an influx of Rs5,07,000 crore in cash, of which 10% is likely to be left at lenders. That type of influx could allow banks to lower their deposit rates, and in turn, their lending ratesproviding a vital deployment of credit.What I do in a month, Ive done in a day, said SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya, regarding the influx of low-cost deposits. Surely the cost of funds is something that is going to ease, she said, adding the bank believed that would result in a fall in lending rates.Banking shares have surged, with SBI up 11.3% in the two days after the announcement, although it fell 3% on Friday.Also Read: Rs500, Rs1000 note ban: Tax evaders engaging in illegal transactions on I-T dept radarMuch will depend on how many deposits end up actually coming in, but there is room for hope.

It is estimated to have revenue of more than $200 million.Wipro chief executive officer Abidali Z. Neemuchwala said it is important for companies to transform the way they engage with customers and employees by leveraging the power of the cloud. Since Neemuchwala joined the company in April last year, Wipro has spent $1.13 billion to buy four companies, including Appirio.Wipro spent $95 million in July 2015 to buy Denmark-based design firm Designit, with a revenue of $30 million, to give a boost to its newly created business division, Wipro Digital.In December, it paid $78 million to buy Cellent, a German technology company with over $90 million in revenue, that implements and maintains SAP software for clients in automobile and manufacturing segments. In February, Wipro paid $460 million to buy HealthPlan Services, a Florida, US-based technology firm that brings over $220 million in business by offering solutions to health insurance firms. Wipro also tried buying Viteos Group but later called off the buyout, citing inordinate delays in the completion of the acquisition. The Times of India first reported the Appirio deal.Wipros decision to buy Appirio mirrors the approach followed by its larger peers Accenture Plc. and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM). Accenture bought Salesforce partner, Cloud Sherpas in September last year while IBM bought Salesforce partner Bluewolf Group in April this year.This deal is about giving Wipro the capabilities to scale out IT services in the cloud world. What it gains are some strong methodologies in delivering in the cloud, and  significant partnerships such as Workday, Salesforce, Amazon, and Google, said Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm.More importantly, Wipro can take those methodologies and scale out to adjust for building revenue in the cloud.

0.13,"Adversity brings out the best or the worst in people. The downturn in Indias start-up funding market over the past 12 months brought out the worst in the founders of some of the countrys most valuable start-ups. 
				   
				Strapped for capital and under assault from foreign competitors with deep pockets, such founders came down to playing the nationalist card and seeking the governments help in keeping non-Indian players out of the market.For Indias venture capital industry, on the other hand, the downturn has been a time to introspect, salvage, consolidate and rebuild.We look at some of the highs and lows that marked the countrys venture capital market in the past 12 months.1. The year started in the shadow of the first serious downturn that this market has seen in the decade since venture capital re-established its roots here as an asset class. Hedge funds, which fanned a valuation bubble in the start-up funding market for nearly two years, had fled late last year, leaving behind a yawning gap in the late-stage funding market. Hedge funds may have deserted the start-up market but global limited partners, institutional investors who back venture capital funds, stayed committed, in fact, upped their commitments. Two of the countrys biggest ever venture capital funds were raised in the last 12 months. In February, Sequoia Capital India, the countrys largest venture capital firm, raised a massive $920 million fund, dwarfing even some of the big private equity funds raised here lately. Last month, Accel Partners India closed commitments for a $450 million fund, only the second fund of that size since the one raised by Nexus Venture Partners in December last year. Limited partner commitments have also flowed into smaller funds. In May, Bengaluru-based Saama Capital raised a $31 million third fund. In October, Mumbai-based Blume Ventures closed $60 million in commitments for its second fund. By London-based researcher Preqins estimates, as of September, Indias venture capital industry was sitting on dry powder, or uninvested capital, worth more than $3 billion.2. Limited partners, however, remain concerned about poor returns on their past investments. In a bid to alleviate those concerns, fund managers at venture capital firms went into overdrive to shore up exits. The numbers for the closing quarter of 2016 are yet to come in. However, in the nine months of the year ended September, venture capital firms closed 54 exit deals worth $1.41 billion, exceeding the 43 exit deals worth 1.39 billion closed in all of 2015, according to data compiled by Chennai-based researcher Venture Intelligence.The exit run isnt yet as robust as both limited partners and fund managers would like, but a handful of deals set this year apart. In July, online travel services company Yatra delivered a partial exit to its investors, Norwest Venture Partners, TV18 Group and Valiant Capital, when it struck a reverse merger with Nasdaq-listed special purpose acquisition company Terrapin 3 Acquisition Corp. The deal involved an $80 million cash payout to Yatras investors. Yatra debuted on Nasdaq this week following the completion of the merger. Another significant deal was the August acquisition of payments company Citrus Payments Solutions by South African internet conglomerate Naspers in a $130 million all-cash deal, a rare event in Indias venture capital market. The deal was a big payday for Sequoia Capital India, which had invested about $10 million over three funding rounds for a reported 32% stake. The offline retail sector served up a surprise big exitin August, private equity firm TA Associates bought an undisclosed stake in womenswear maker TCNS Clothing Co. for $140 million. Most of that went into buying Matrix Partners undisclosed stake in the company, earning the venture capital firm a 5x return on its original investment.3. Not all exits were happy events. As venture capital firms got to work consolidating their past investments, fire sales, write-offs and stock-swap deals were equally visible through the year. Things kicked off early with the much speculated January acquisition of property search and listings platform Commonfloor by online classifieds platform Quikr in a reported all-stock deal. The deal gave Commonfloors backers, Tiger Global Management, Accel Partners India and Google Capital, who collectively invested more than $60 million in the company, stakes in Quikr. In May, another troubled start-up, TinyOwl, was ushered into a stock-swap merger by its investors. The online food ordering service merged with hyperlocal delivery service Roadrunnr. The combined entity now operates as Runnr, with Sequoia Capital, Nexus Venture Partners, Matrix Partners and Blume Ventures as investors. The four venture capital firms had collectively pumped close to $40 million into the two companies prior to the merger.Rocket Internet, the Berlin-based start-up incubator and investor was involved in two deals that are widely believed to be distress sales. In April, it sold its online furniture store FabFurnish to Kishore Biyanis Future Group for an undisclosed sum and in July, online fashion store Jabong was picked up by e-commerce company Flipkart for just $70 million, a massive erosion from the $503 million Jabong was valued at in 2013. The other notable distress sale this year was Titans acquisition of a majority stake in jewellery e-tailer Caratlane for $53 million in May. The deal just about enabled Caratlanes backer Tiger Global to cover its reported investment of $52 million. By most accounts, the consolidation and cleaning out of portfolios is still well underway and will continue well into the next year. The portfolio to watch, though, will be New York-based hedge fund Tiger Globals 60-odd start-up investments here, including e-commerce bellwether Flipkart.4. The sticky issue of leadership transition in the venture capital industry found itself in the spotlight this year in the aftermath of a bitter spat in December last year within the investment team at Helion Venture Partners. Helion is one of Indias oldest home-grown venture capital firms and it came apart at the seams when its second line of partners, Alok Goyal, Rahul Chowdhri and Ritesh Banglani, quit the firm in a huff. The younger partners wanted more of a say in how the firm was run and a greater share of profits. The founding partners, Sanjeev Aggarwal, Rahul Chandra and Ashish Gupta, didnt share that view. The standoff exposed the fragile power equations that exist in what is still a fairly nascent industry. The incident served as a wake-up call to several other venture capital firms that have been around as long as Helion and will hopefully deter such ugly and public quarrels in future.5. Sometimes, even the ugliest fights have good outcomes. Helions Goyal, Chowdhri and Banglani have since started up on their own with Stellaris Venture Partners and are in the middle of raising their debut fund. Earlier this year, SAIF Partners principals Mukul Singhal and Rohit Jain broke away from the firm, amicably, to start their own seed investments-focused venture capital firm Pravega Ventures. Earlier, former Ventureast partners Sateesh Andra and Ramesh Byrapaneni struck out on their own to launch Endiya Partners, focused on seed and Series A investments, and raised initial commitments for their debut fund in January.

				Lenders such as State Bank of India (SBI) and Punjab National Bank (PNB) are exploring the idea of moving to a variable pay structure, which will be based on the performance of employees.SBI is looking to introduce an employee stock ownership plan and grading system based on an employees performance, said a senior SBI official on condition of anonymity. PNB plans to approach its board with a proposal to introduce performance-based pay for all officials above the level of chief manager.Today, an employees salary is predictable. There is a need to recognize performance and give remuneration. We have formed an internal committee of general managers to work on this matter and submit the proposal to the board, Usha Ananthasubramanian, managing director and chief executive officer of PNB, said at an analysts meeting, after the lenders earnings announcement.Usha also added that PNB had earlier tried to move to a variable pay structure for all employees under the chairmanship of K.C. Chakrabarty, but failed in its attempt.PNB ran up Rs1,967.16 crore in employee costs for the quarter to September, up from Rs1,877.56 crore a year ago. SBIs staff expenses rose to Rs6,257 crore from Rs5,906 crore in the same period.Banks are discussing moving to their own pay structures after the finance ministry asked them to start the process for the 11th bipartite wage pact before the current five-year settlement expires in October 2017.The ministry has asked banks to start early, instead of waiting for the culmination of the current wage pact, an official with the Indian Banks Association (IBA), which groups all banks in India, said on condition of anonymity.As large banks explore the idea of moving to their own pay structure, a few smaller ones including Union Bank, Syndicate Bank and Vijaya Bank have sent their consent to IBA to be a part of the process for negotiating a new wage agreement, added the official.The transition to a productivity-linked settlement is easier said than done. Such a move will face stiff resistance from bank employees unions, which are used to a uniform wage hike.We will oppose a variable pay structure if banks go ahead and introduce this system. We are for more efficiency and productivity, but we dont want differentiation in salary, said C.H, Venkatachalam, general secretary of the All India Bank Employees Association. Bank employees unions have, meanwhile, started preparing a charter of demands that will be submitted to IBA by January 2017.We are looking at an adequate hike in salary this time, in conformity with rising inflation. We are also looking at a higher starting salary for attracting new talent, special facilities for women and improvement in post-retirement benefits, said Venkatachalam.Around one million bank employees across public sector banks, old private sector and a few foreign banks are part of the industry-level wage settlement.According to the 10th bipartite wage settlement, banks and unions agreed to a 15% hike in wages, which resulted in an outgo of Rs5,000 crore for the system. Also agreed to were bank holidays on second and fourth Saturdays.Also, PSU banks have been reeling under losses and mounting NPAs and implementing the variable pay structure may be ill-timed. Concept of variable pay structure is sound.

0.01,"Bengaluru: The Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) in Bengaluru on Thursday ruled in favour of creditors seeking to recover more than Rs9,000 crore in unpaid loans they extended to Vijay Mallyas defunct Kingfisher Airlines Ltd.
				   
				In a 145-page order, the DRTs presiding officer K. Sreenivasan asked a consortium of banks led by State Bank of India (SBI) to start the process of recovering the Rs6,203.35 crore they claimed in 2013, at a yearly interest rate of 11.5%, until the whole amount is paid back.Mallya flew to the UK in March last year as creditors closed in on him. He and his companies Kingfisher Airlines, United Breweries Holdings Ltd and Kingfisher Finvest India Ltd are liable to pay the money that, together with interest, adds up to more than Rs9,000 crore.Businesses should realize that it will be no longer possible for them to avail loans of public money, default in repayment and try to get away through the lanes and by-lanes of twisted facts, the DRT order said.The order brings to an end a three-year legal battle in the tribunal by a consortium of 17 banks seeking to recover the money owed by Kingfisher Airlines, which was grounded in 2012 under the weight of heavy debt and accumulated losses.It allows the lenders to sell properties seized from Mallya to recover the money. SBI and tax authorities have been unable to sell properties such as Kingfisher House in Mumbai, Kingfisher Villa in Goa and Mallyas personal jet, among other possessions, because of high base prices and a weak real estate market. In spite of sale of properties mentioned in the schedule, if the OA (original application) amount is not fully realised then the applicant bank is at liberty to proceed against the person and other properties of the defendants as required under law and also as advised, the DRT order said. Lenders will now have to file a memo with the original claim plus interest and other costs to be recovered from Mallya and his firms, after which the DRT will issue a recovery certificate. The next step is to get a recovery certificate from the DRT so that sale of assets can be pushed for with a shorter notice period, said a senior official at SBI with direct knowledge of the case. He didnt want to be named.We will await a copy of the orders passed by the DRT and file an appeal accordingly, said UB Group spokesperson Sumanto Bhattacharya.The defendants are likely to approach the debt recovery appellate tribunal within 60 days, according to a Bengaluru-based lawyer directly involved in the case who asked not to be named. The order cannot be executed by the banks until the end of the appeal period, which gives Mallya and his firms 60 days to chalk out a strategy, the lawyer said. According to the DRT Act, an appeal can be heard only if the appellantMallya and his companies in this casedeposit 75% of the amount claimed. This amount can be waived or reduced by the judge hearing the case. SBI has written off Rs7,016 crore in loans by 63 wilful defaulters, including Kingfisher Airlines, Daily News & Analysis newspaper reported on 16 November. Finance minister Arun Jaitley said the same day that the write-offs dont mean a loan waiver and that defaulters will be pursued. In March last year, SBI moved DRT for a second time to seek an arrest warrant against Mallya, revocation of his passport, details of his assets and liabilities as well as an order to seize a $75 million payout made to him by spirits maker Diageo Plc.

0.6,"London:  Ashish Thakkar, who co-founded Africa banking conglomerate Atlas Mara Ltd with ex-Barclays Plc. head Bob Diamond, is a 35-year-old billionaire whose divorce fight has been prolonged, thanks to a complex web of offshore assets. 
				   
				The question of how much Thakkar is worthhe says $541,000 while his wife claims his wealth is far greateris coming under scrutiny in a UK divorce court. A judge in the London family court has denied Thakkars request for a final divorce decree until a determination of his real worth.This is a case where the wife says her husband is a billionaire, judge Philip Moor said in the ruling that shows the difficulty courts have in making a fair assessment of wealth. All the assets are offshore. They are held in very complicated structures that have changed within the recent past. The situation is one where it can be very significant if you are a wife or a former wife.The judges ruling, which was handed down in June and published on the courts website last week, extends a legal battle over the less than five-year marriage that has cast a spotlight on the entrepreneur, whose own foundation has promoted him as Africas youngest billionaire.Financial puzzlesUK judges have become used to unpicking complex webs of offshore assets in high-stakes divorces as spouses sometimes plead net worth far less than what the other spouse claims is their actual fortune. The forensic tracing of assets is a problem that has played out in other scenarios judges have faced across the world from tax avoidance schemes to fraud prosecutions.Based on his disclosed public and closely held assets, Thakkars net worth is valued at $425 million, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His most valuable asset is Ison BPO (Business Process Outsourcing), a UAE-based outsourcing company that operates in Africa and India.Lawyers for Meera Thakkar declined to comment as did a spokesman for Ashish Thakkar. Thakkars lawyers didnt respond to a call seeking comment. In court filings, Thakkar has argued that the beneficiaries of his companies are his mother and sister.While the Thakkar case is at the London high court, similar issues have reached the countrys top court before. The ex-wife of oil trader Michael Prest won a Supreme Court ruling giving her the right to force offshore companies owned by her ex-husband to turn over assets as part of a 17.5 million-pound settlement in 2013. Prests lawyers argued at the time that the courts had no right to pierce the corporate veil of his companies to fund the settlement as they were separate entities and unrelated to the marriage.He was later threatened with up to four weeks in jail for failing to pay his ex-wife 360,000 pounds in 2015 despite his assets being estimated by the judge to be in the region of 37 million pounds.Allegations of hiding assets in divorce cases is nothing new and UK judges have wide discretion to set values as they see fit, according to Graham Coy, a lawyer at Stowe Family Law, who isnt involved in the Thakkar case.If someone is determined to try and hide their assets it is possible, but they could still end up being clobbered in the end anyway because a judge can just take a view on how much theyre worth and if they dont like it, prove it, Coy said.The ex-wife of a property magnate Scot Young told a London judge in one of the highest profile divorce cases in recent years that Young was hiding billions from her while he claimed he was about 28 million pounds in debt.The judge said in the 2013 ruling that Young wasnt a penniless man of straw with huge debts, and that hed hidden from the court about 40 million pounds in assets. Young fell to his death from a fourth-floor window of his flat in London in late 2014.The Supreme Court rolled back two divorce settlements in a 2015 decision that underlined Londons claim to be the divorce capital of the world. The top court ruled two ex-wives are entitled to larger divorce settlements because their husbands hid their true wealth, the decision could pave the way for previous divorce agreements to be revisited many years after they were agreed.Adventures in AfricaThakkars story began in Idi Amins Uganda. His family was among Asian families the dictator expelled in 1972, and moved to the UK, where Thakkar was born. They returned to Africa when he was a child, this time to Rwanda, where his family lost everything during the genocide in 1994, Thakkar says in his 2015 autobiography, The Lion Awakes: Adventures in Africas Economic Miracle.Thakkars own success has prompted him to be branded Africas youngest billionaire. Hes described that way in a 2013 video on a YouTube channel for his charity, the Mara Foundation. He is introduced as that at conferences and asked about it in media interviews.At 15, after the family had returned to Uganda, Thakkar sold a laptop to his dads friend, triggering the realization he could be a trader. His father gave him $5,000 start-up cash, and he started flying to Dubai to buy cheap computer products, which he sold from a tiny shop in central Kampala.He expanded his business by setting up a Dubai-based company. He later started a packaging factory in Uganda and partnered with an Indian Information Technology services company to help them gain entry in new markets across Africa, according to his websites.Thakkar and Diamond met at an event, hit it off and decided that they could start a banking venture together. Thakkar remains a non-executive director with Atlas Mara, which he and Diamond founded with the idea of buying up stakes in banks across sub-Saharan Africa. The company, domiciled in the British Virgin Islands, has raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors through share offerings since 2013.Its important to think big, dream big, but start small, Thakkar says in interviews and speeches. I dont want to bring Silicon Valley to Africa. I want to bring Africa to Silicon Valley. I think its important to be authentic, genuine, real. Bloomberg",2016-10-28,wmRGZq13ETIUlGFEZ4edJI,"Ashish Thakkar, co-founder of Atlas Mara Ltd , is having a prolonged divorce fight thanks to a complex web of offshore assets.

				The stock price of several non-banking financial companies have galloped. Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services Ltd (Mahindra Finance) has run-up 20%, outpacing the Sensex over the last six months. The rise hasnt abated even after the company posted a mixed set of numbers for the September quarter last week.Mahindra Finances disbursals grew 29% for the second quarter that led to an impressive 14% growth in assets under management (AUM), the fastest in four quarters for the company and this seems to have pleased its investors. Although the net profit took a beating and fell 35% from a year ago to Rs948 crore, it was forgiven after the management indicated better days lie ahead in terms of recovery. Indeed, given the cyclical nature of Mahindra Finances portfolio and that AUM growth was broad based, there is little reason to mistrust the managements outlook.But one look at the asset quality of the September quarter shows the picture is far from rosy. Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) grew by a massive 35% to form 11% of the loan book as of 30 September. The net NPA ratio rose to 5.4% indicating the company is not lucky in upgrades and recoveries too. In its interaction with analysts, Mahindra Finance said that credit costs would come down to 250-275 basis points for 2016-17 from around 300 basis points in the previous year as a bountiful monsoon translates into more cash with rural households and businesses. A basis point is 0.01%. Another thorn in the firms book is high operating costs. A stockpile of Rs4,748 crore of gross bad loans would keep provisions elevated and operating expenses too will stay high as Mahindra Finance is unlikely to slow down its expansion plans.The stock trades at a price to book value multiple of 3.4 of its FY16 earnings. Valuations appear expensive and brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher notes the same.

0.94,"New Delhi: The quest for energy efficiency is transforming Indias Rs15,000 crore a year market for lighting systems. Conventional lamps are being replaced by efficient ones starting from simple LED (light emitting diode) bulbs to sophisticated movement-detecting lighting systems for smart cities and businesses, opening up a host of opportunities to lighting companies from the very bottom of the pyramid to high-end consumers. Harshavardhan Chitale, vice-chairman and managing director of Philips Lighting India Ltd, speaks to Mint about the industrys changing dynamics.
				   
				Edited excerpts from the interview:What is your strategy for growth in India?
We have actively contributed to improving the health of power distribution companies with energy savings. Lighting as a whole contributes to 18-20% of total power consumption in the country. To bridge our energy deficit, we need to either increase power generation or reduce the need for power itself, through energy efficiency. If the entire lighting system of the country is converted into efficient LED lighting or smart connected lighting, our total lighting-related power demand will get reduced by half. It frees up about 30 gigawatt (GW) of our over 300GW generation capacity. That more than bridges our peak power deficit, which is the result of increased power consumption for lighting at peak hours.Secondly, in spite of the drive to electrify all the villages, there will always be parts of India where providing grid-connected power is not economical, as the cost of laying wire will be much more than the cost of power generation. About 20 crore people, or four to five crore households in the country, have either no access to power or get only intermittent supply. Making energy-efficient lighting, especially those run on solar power, available to them will solve our energy access problem.What are the growth opportunities that energy efficiency offers to companies like yours in urban areas?
Home lighting, lights used by businesses and organizations and infrastructure and street lighting are the three major areas of power consumption. India has about three crore street lamps which remain lit for about 10 hours a day, which is a major segment of consumption. For businesses, upgrading to energy-efficient lighting offers a high return on their investment by way of savings in power bill. Payback period for upgrading all lighting systems ranges between two and three years. Almost three-fourth of all new lights bought by businesses are energy-efficient LED lights. There is also a trend among businesses to go for smart lighting, which can sense movement of people and the number of people in the surrounding and produce light accordingly. This intelligent lighting offers about 30% of energy saving in addition to the 50% saving that LEDs per se offer. Some organizations are now getting into what is called managed services. That is, companies like ours upgrade their lighting infrastructure and they pay us in instalments for using that infrastructure. Their savings from power bills helps them pay their instalments to the service provider. Manufacturing companies as well as information technology firms, which are very familiar with the concept of managed services, are going for this.Is smart lighting of streets catching up?
Many states have started to adopt efficient street lamps because of the Smart City initiative, but a lot more is to be done. India has 5,000 towns and at least 100 large cities and three crore street lights. Some cities have upgraded to connected smart street lights. One example is Naya Raipur, the new capital of Chhattisgarh. This city has probably the worlds most modern connected lighting infrastructure that is monitored remotely. The city engineer monitors the infrastructure from his office. If a bulb needs replacement, it gets reported automatically. We are also upgrading the lighting infrastructure of many cities in Tamil Nadu, including Chennai. Finances of the state and the municipalities concerned are important in going for an upgrade. The upgrade is quicker where the municipality concerned has a clear financial model such as central government funding or multilateral aid or lending. Besides energy saving, the cost of maintenance for efficient lights is less and the quality of light is also better.In overseas markets, especially in Europe, we have executed projects where lights remain dim when there is no one in the street and the light intensity goes up when movement of people or vehicle is detected. Indian cities have not gone for this level of sophistication, but the journey has started.The government promotes LED bulbs in a big way. Has it captured the market for home lighting?
In the consumer segment, about 30% of the lights sold today are LED bulbs and the rest are conventional bulbs. The large market share that conventional bulbs still enjoy is not because of any price advantage, but because they are more easily available in the neighbourhood. Its a question of distribution. Some of the LED options are cheaper than conventional bulbs. We need to address this.How can this be tackled?
Firstly, the products that should be adopted have to be of high quality and should be designed for the domestic market with high voltage fluctuation tolerance. Use of poor-quality products can sabotage the adoption of LED bulbs as it would adversely affect public perception of the benefits of energy-efficient products. The next wave of LED adoption will get supported by a robust retailing ecosystem. We go to a nearby retailer to replace a bulb, not to a power distribution utility that stocks these products. The total lighting market in India as per industry estimates is Rs15,000 crore a year. This excludes new pockets of demand such as the remote areas where solar-powered LED bulbs would be required.More than 93% of the lighting equipment that Philips sells in India is designed for India and is made in India.",2016-09-20,woGw5FGjDjQubIV5AEkyaP,"Philips Lighting India MD Harshavardhan Chitale on the lighting industrys changing dynamics

0.21,"The baton is being passed at ITC Ltd. Executive chairman Y.C. Deveshwar will move to a non-executive chairmans position, making way for a successor. The new chief has not been announced yet, making the transition incomplete. As of now, Deveshwar will guide and mentor a new executive management. The market will be watching to see if this means business as usual or a new ITC could be in the making. The companys share fell by 1.12% on Wednesday.
				   
				The new chief has big shoes to fill. This change comes when its flagship business of cigarettes is facing tough times. Rising excise duties on cigarettes and public health concerns around tobacco pose a serious threat. ITCs cigarette volumes have been declining, unthinkable a decade or even five years ago.Fiscal year 2017 is the first year in many which is seeing a milder increase in excise duties. But the governments compulsion to tax to grow revenues and the anti-tobacco lobbys pressure to curb consumption are unlikely to go away. The proposed goods and services tax is an opportunity. Managing to get cigarettes under it will be a big victory, as it will mean a more certain and level tax regime.Another key task for a new chief will be to assess ITCs diversification bids. The hotels business has proved tough for most Indian firms and ITC is no exception. ITC says paper and paperboards are strategic for the packaging used by its cigarettes division. Segment-wise data for the company is available since FY03. If we look at the increase in profits between then and FY16, cigarettes contributed to 84.4% of that, paper 5.9% and hotels only 0.4%. The consumer goods business contributed 1.7% but thats a different story.ALSO READ: The metamorphosis of ITC under Y.C. Deveshwar

The consumer goods business was Deveshwars master stroke, although a cigarettes-consumer goods combination was first made famous by RJR Nabisco Inc. The consumer goods business contributed to 31.3% of incremental sales in this 13-year period and is now more than half the size of the cigarettes business. ITCs focus was on building scale in the original segments, moving quickly to achieve this, and then identifying new ones.But profitability has played second fiddle to sales growth. In the 13-year period, the consumer goods business has reported slender segment profits in only the past two years. It is still nowhere close to what consumer goods firms earn. The pressure on cigarette sales and profits may have made ITC a bit cautious in recent years. The new chief executive may examine whether a rethink on the growth-profitability mix is needed, including a focus on fewer categories and brands.ALSO READ: The house that Yogi Deveshwar built

He or she no doubt has a tough act to follow. Deveshwars term has seen a good mix of sales and profit growth. Sales grew at a compound annual growth rate of 14.3% while Ebidta (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) increased by 18%. That is better than Hindustan Unilever Ltds (HULs) comparative figures of 11.9% and 14.9%, respectively. Shareholder wealth has risen by 51.8 times since March 1996, compared with HULs 18 times. The initial phase of a new appointees tenure may be to simply do things better. Eventually, the new CEO will need to chart out a course that leaves a lasting imprint on ITCs future, just as Deveshwar did.",2016-06-22,wozwHRIRCXgY9iW5iFWc2H,"The management change at the top comes when ITCs flagship business of cigarettes is facing tough times with rising excise duties and health concerns around tobacco

				Crisil Ltd has rated JSPLs debt, all of Rs.32,638 crore, as default, citing delayed payment of interest on term loans due to weakened liquidity. Falling steel price realizations are affecting margins and this tough period is coinciding with obligations to repay debt. Delays in the companys plans to raise funds by selling assets, transferring certain assets to joint ventures and refinancing debt have not moved ahead.If JSPLs steel business is under pressure, then its power business too is suffering from demand and price volatility in the merchant market and lack of raw material integration, says the Crisil note. In addition to the debt downgrade, a 9 March Economic Times report indicated that lenders of foreign debt worth $500 million (around Rs.3,375 crore) may recall their loans.The problem is indeed a difficult one but it isnt new. All the negative news in this week prompted JSPL to issue a note which mostly reiterates what everyone knows but for a few points. The rating is based on technical grounds, it said, and added that the company had met its obligations till November-December. JSPL said it is confident that once its efforts to restructure debt are complete, it will not be in default. However, what is not stated is when this exercise will be completedthe quarter has barely 20 days to end.JSPL also said that additional steel and power capacity that have been commissioned are stabilizing. Higher output, improving demand and realizations should lead to better cash flows in FY17 than seen in the past four quarters. In the December quarter, its Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) was Rs.550 crore, while its interest cost was Rs.806 crore.Given time, it is reasonable to expect JSPLs business position to improve. The government is keen to ensure that both the power and steel sectors do better and, in turn, ensure that the banking sectors assets dont turn bad. Those measures are working and steel prices have begun to move up. Will this continue even as an increase in domestic steel capacity leads to more supply? A recent report by Morgan Stanley Research states that the worst is over for steel, as China is moving to curb its excess capacity. Even in power, the situation is beginning to look better.The real issues are how much time lenders are willing to give JSPL to get back on track, how long the company will take to work out a comprehensive debt restructuring programme, and how much time it will take for the firm to fulfil its plan to sell stakes in some of its operations. Buyers know its desperate situation and may drive a much tougher bargain than in normal times.A default rating does raise the fear, however remote the possibility, of all these measures not working out, and lenders moving in to take control.

Importantly, it marked L&Ts transition from a sizeable engineering and cement conglomerate into an indomitable edifice spanning several businesses such as hydrocarbons, heavy engineering, finance and information technology (IT).That said, L&Ts key focus area remains infrastructure, engineering and construction that today comprises about 45% of its revenue, compared with 83% from engineering and construction way back in 2004.Some analysts have been critical of Naiks diversification into unrelated areas such as finance and information technology (IT), though others consider these as cash-accretive businesses that would provide a hedge against economic recession.Proof of this was seen in the companys financial results during the last two years, when profit growth in the infrastructure segment dropped to single digits. Overall profitability got a leg-up from IT and financial services that did well and helped buck an economic slowdown.Again, Naiks decision to enter these businesses can be lauded in that the two recently announced public issues of L&T Infotech Ltd and L&T Technology Services will help unlock shareholder value as the money deployed in these businesses generates good returns.Further, Naik leaves behind a legacy of not just diverse businesses but diverse markets, too. From a pure domestic infrastructure firm a little over a decade ago, L&T is now present in new markets, such as West Asia. Today, almost one-third of its annual order inflows come from overseas, offsetting the slow pace of infrastructure development and order inflows in the country.Of course, in West Asia, the firms timing was perhaps wrong as the crude oil price crash stymied expansions in this region.L&Ts strength lies not just in diversification, but also in attaining size and scale in its businesses, enough to compete well.From FY03 till FY16, L&Ts consolidated revenue has grown at a CAGR of 19% to touch Rs.1.026 trillion. Growth in profit after tax has been even better at 23% CAGR.That said, sustaining fixed costs and overheads in the face of an economic slowdown is challenging. This is mirrored in its operating margin that has slowly started trending lower from 13-14% about a decade ago and is unlikely to improve in the near term.That apart, L&T could boast of a sizeable order book, enough to generate revenue for the next two years. But then, its balance sheet is also weighed down by the same. Economic slowdown and project delays due to tight liquidity conditions among customers has led to a surge in working capital requirements that is one-fourth its net revenue.The change of guard comes with huge challenges, too. Through Naiks tenure, L&T has been unable to churn out profits from some businesses. Its shipbuilding, heavy forgings, hydrocarbons, power and road subsidiaries are either loss-making or have wafer-thin profits.The scene is far from cushy in developmental projects that include roads, ports, bridges and urban infrastructure. For example, the FY16 annual report shows that while its road projects clocked single-digit revenue growth, high interest costs and depreciation translated into losses.The street is also concerned about the Hyderabad Metro project, mired in clearance hurdles and delays. It is likely to bleed once it is fully operational and weigh on L&Ts overall profitability.A Religare Capital Markets report says that decisions of capital misallocations in the recent past may not be addressed in the expected timelines. If so, it would tell on profitability. Meanwhile, analysts feel that FY17 will mirror the full impact of the new accounting (Ind-AS) norms, which could hurt profit growth given the more stringent provisions required.Be that as it may, Naiks successor is faced with the task of precariously balancing the juggernaut, until macroeconomic winds turn more favourable.",2016-09-09,x0cXVktXgElid8CsJZMZpL,"AM Naiks successor is faced with the task of precariously balancing the juggernaut, until macroeconomic winds turn more favourable

0.52,"The doubling of the coal cess may end up undermining the revival plan for state power distribution companies (discoms). Thats because the cess will further diminish the competitiveness of coal-based electricity at a time when renewable sources of power are getting cheaper.
				   
				To be sure, thermal tariff is still lower. NTPC Ltds average rate stood at Rs.3.21 per unit in the first nine months of this fiscal year, a good rupee less than the cheapest solar power rates. But when state discoms pass on the additional cess to end-consumers, the tariff would rise by 3-7% or 9-13 paise per unit, estimates Nomura. Now, note that this will be added aggravation for industrial and commercial consumers. This set of consumers is already paying high tariffsas much as three times the average NTPC rate and double the solar rates in some states.As solar gets cheaper and thermal power turns expensive, the viability for moving to their own renewable energy source gets better. The decentralized nature of solar capacityyou can put panels on rooftopsand the governments own push to step up renewable energy are key drivers.As this shift gains momentum, it could spell trouble for state discoms. Industrial and commercial consumers bear the brunt of discom inefficiencies and subsidize agricultural consumers. According to Power Finance Corp. Ltd, industrial and non-domestic customers together consume a little less than 40% of electricity, but generate 55% of SEB (state electricity boards) revenues.Once solar power storage becomes economical, it may see an accelerated adoption. Ind-Ra (India Ratings) believes this may disrupt the operations of the discoms as these industrial consumers are the highest tariff consumers which subsidize the retail tariffs, India Ratings said in a note. Once this cross subsidy decreases as industrial load reduces, the discoms would then opt to increase tariffs for retail consumers, at which point even the retail consumers may switch to rooftop solar power. This over a period of time could become a self-feeding loop.One of the large discom customers, Indian Railways, is already bypassing them by purchasing electricity directly from producers. The flexibility of solar (in terms of installation) can also drive other commercial and industrial consumers down a similar path.Of course, the shift may not happen overnight and all industrial customers cannot afford to build solar capacities. But if the government continues to load thermal tariffs with taxes, the shift may gather pace.",2016-03-04,xEYjx89e28XLyPofhvNhZO,"As solar gets cheaper and thermal power turns expensive, the viability for moving to their own renewable energy source gets better

0.5,"The next few years will be definitive for the evolution of Indias digital infrastructure and the role it can play in the countrys growth. There is significant unfinished businessIndia is ranked 91st among 139 countries on the Networked Readiness Index 2016, compiled by the World Economic Forum (WEF). Only 15 out of 100 households have access to the Internet, and mobile broadband remains for a privileged few, with only 5.5 subscriptions for every 100 people, according to the WEF. However, India has skipped a generation in telecom technologygoing from no connectivity to over 350 million mobile Internet usersin less than two decades. This needs to be factored in while planning the democratization of digital access in India. 
				   
				The impending growth of digital assets will present India with many unique opportunities to leapfrog its traditional deficit in physical infrastructure. It will help enhance the economic conditions in remote areas, spur new businesses by enabling access for a large number of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), creating a strong digital identity for the country. Above all, digital infrastructure growth can empower the government to embrace and enable innovation, provide resources to help increase agricultural productivity as well as enable improved healthcare access for rural areas, potentially reducing mortality levels. It can also bring financial services to the unbanked rural and underprivileged communities and help fulfil the countrys longstanding goal of education for all. Digital literacy in smaller towns and villages can create employment in sectors such as business process outsourcing (BPO), retail, IT, telecom and financial services. Digital India can also ensure citizens have ubiquitous access to government services. While mobile technology has begun to make a transformative impact, digital access in Internet dark areas, could have a larger socio-economic impact.                                                                                                                              *******While the story of the potential value that Indias digital infrastructure can add, has been told many times, developments in this sector have so far lagged expectations. The governments flagship projectthe National Optical Fibre Network (NOFN)is yet to fulfil its promise for rural India. In this scenario, we continue to trail the worlds major economies in telecom infrastructure maturity and penetration. Network investments by mobile operators are being held back, due to the poor economics driven by low tariffs and a high level of competition. This has hit carriers ability to upgrade consumer services, meet demand in highly populated urban areas and expand networks to provide coverage to rural areas. The next few years could see unprecedented changes in the quantity and quality of digital access. Few would argue against the need for a robust digital infrastructure in India. However, one must realize that the economic barriers to that are very high. The following factors will be key to achieving Indias digital infrastructure dream:Expanding spectrum assets: Few policy changes have a greater impact on infrastructure creation, than optimizing spectrum availability over time by releasing unlicensed spectrum, revising allocations and enabling free sharing and trading. Spectrum is a scarce resource. The ever-increasing projections of mobile traffic growth in India, make a compelling business case for allocating more spectrum for mobile usage. These allocations need to include licensed and unlicensed spectrum bands to accommodate both network coverage and capacity needs. While India has taken a few steps in the right direction such as the department of defence releasing spectrum in the 1,800-2,100 MHz bands, it still needs a better and more comprehensive spectrum policy. India lags behind many developed and emerging markets in per-capita availability of spectrum. Also, the cost of spectrum here is one of the highest in the world. The primary goal for policymakers should be to maximize the use of spectrum, rather than focusing on its short-term value. Also, the more harmonized the spectrum used by mobile operators, the more economically viable the overall solution to improving Internet access. This calls for effective synchronization of Indias spectrum planning, allocation, network design, financing and construction. Also needed is a national policy to enable access densification in areas with low-income but high-growth potential.Creating broadband infrastructure: Let us turn our attention to the resources required for the creation of broadband infrastructure. India currently ranks low in broadband penetration, even among developing countries. Internet access has grown, driven by a higher penetration of mobile handsets and wireless infrastructure in urban and tier I and tier II towns, but  broadband penetration in the larger part of the country is still dismal. Current estimates show that broadband only reaches approximately 600 corridors, largely in and around the top 50-100 Indian cities. On the other hand, the country aspires to create a Digital India with a broadband highway offering a 100-Mbps connectivity to 250,000 gram panchayats. The funds needed to create a national IP backbone and ensure last-mile connectivity have not been supported by a strong underlying business case. The creation of Digital Bharat calls for radical changes to regulatory frameworks, allowing the generation of viable business models for inclusive broadband growth. There is significant public funding involved in making NOFN come true, but private sector operators have so far seen little value in pursuing fiber deployment beyond the top cities. This calls for the creation of robust models of public-private partnership, driven by a combination of rights of way, release of spectrum and creation of a content ecosystem to spur revenue generation via digital infrastructure. Enhancing technology adoption: This is the other side of the story, where industry participants need to get their act together. Over the last few years, new and existing players have made significant investments in transforming the infrastructure for 3G/4G/LTE roll-outs. In a country with relatively low average revenue per user (ARPU), carriers will need to continue focusing on infrastructure build-outs to increase coverage and improve customer service quality. With a large part of the data consumption moving indoors, the industry needs to move towards small cell deployments. White-labelled small cell deployment makes great economic sense for all high-demand concentration centres. Further, developments in software-defined-networking (SDN) and network-function-virtualization (NFV), have the potential to redefine the economies of infrastructure deployment for operators. Virtualization needs to become business-as-usual. This will make infrastructure deployments simpler (commodity hardware with centralized software), more cost effective, agile, reliable (battle-proven commodity hardware) and flexible (digitally defined network topology and functions). These virtualized networks will be at the core of the telecom industrys digital transformation, redefining our infrastructure into a programmable platform for a variety of new services. As an example, business-to-business connectivity business models are already being completely disrupted with software-defined wide area networks.                                                                                                                             *******Ultimately, the economics will work when there is demand for services and development of new use cases. The creation of the content and services stack in remote locations, will be key to drive adoption. There are multiple areas where digital infrastructure can play a big role in creating opportunities. These include public and law enforcement records, health data including patient and insurance records and academic and employment records. Other areas include location services, digital identity including identifiers and demographics, communications and local content. Multiple stakeholders need to come together to create an effective ecosystem of content, services and governance that will increase usage, ultimately creating the business case for a robust public-private investment. But implementation of such initiatives is fraught with constraints related to consumer privacy, ownership of data, data security and protection. Digital India will become a reality only if we can create the data ecosystem required and find solutions to overcome these constraints.Over the next few years, we need to prevent market failures in digital infrastructure creationfailures that are borne out of unfavourable economics and lead to suboptimal development of digital infrastructure and issues in both quantity and quality of digital access. The scale of change required to make this happen is disruptive and unprecedented. For digital infrastructure to take root and flourish in India, all stakeholders will have unique roles to play. For individual business leaders, it will mean overcoming technical, economic and business model-related growth challenges in a transformative way. Ultimately, the combination of public-private funding, progressive government policies and freeing up of spectrum assets will determine whether India is able to fully address the digital divide. The initiative will also hinge upon faster adoption of new, cost-effective technologies by industry players and the creation of compelling business use cases. Now is the time for all stakeholders to come together to transform India into a digital economy.Kanchan Samtani and Sumit Sarawgi are partners and directors at BCG.Twenty-five years after liberalization, and 20 years after it entered India, The Boston Consulting Group collaborates with Mint on a series of articles on what lies ahead for the country over the next 20 years.",2017-01-24,xLnErGf2Mq9xDQYj3VHWmI,The impending growth of digital assets will present India with many unique opportunities to leapfrog its traditional deficit in physical infrastructure,02:55,Building Indias digital highway
-0.45,"CESC Ltd reported steady performance for the March quarter. Revenue at the stand-alone level, which constitutes the electricity distribution business in Kolkata, increased 4% from a year ago. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) grew 6%. Net profit rose 1.6% to Rs.248 crore.
				   
				Most analysts were forecasting Ebitda and net profit to drop. The company benefited from low fuel costs and electricity trading. We estimate that a mix of own generation versus power traded turned in favour of the latter as indicated from lower fuel costs year-on-year and higher cost of power purchased during the quarter, ICICI Securities Ltd said in a note.The performance helped the stock close with gains on Thursday. Despite the run-up from February lows, the stock valuations are inexpensive at eight times one-year forward earnings estimates. While low valuations reflect poor investor interest in the sector, two things are clouding the earnings outlook for CESC.One is the lack of sufficient power purchasing agreements for the 600 megawatts (MW) Chandrapur thermal power plant. The second is the continuing loss at the retail business. Both these issues are negatively impacting CESC's consolidated performance.For the year ended 31 March, CESC reported a net profit of Rs.707 crore, slightly higher than a year ago. Of this, CESC was able to retain a profit of Rs.366 crore at the consolidated level, roughly half of what it recorded at the standalone level.The retail venture recorded an operating loss (profit before interest and tax) of Rs.96 crore in 2015-16. The Chandrapur power project is estimated to be seeing a cost under-recovery of around Rs.90 crore on a quarterly basis due to insufficient customers, Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd said in an earnings preview note.Nevertheless, there has been some improvement. Operating loss at the retail business dropped 16% from a year ago. A fuel-supply agreement was signed for the Chandrapur project. It is pursuing a supply agreement for 170 MW with an Uttar Pradesh utility. These developments helped improve the standalone to consolidated net profit conversion ratio from 29% in 2014-15 to around 52% last fiscal.While the improvement is encouraging, progress is slow; and it is not yet clear when the retail business will begin to contribute to consolidated earnings. Similarly, even if the Chandrapur plant manages to clinch a power purchasing agreement with the Uttar Pradesh utility, it will still need to find a buyer for 300MW.

Perhaps there was a thread of doubt that had investors playing safe as the SBI stock has hardly moved over the last two months. But the stock was rightly punished on Friday, with the disappointing results driving down its shares by over 3% to Rs272.90 apiece.But there is more bad news. Out of SBIs Rs19,131 crore loans that slipped during the six months ended September, 40% was from its declared watch list. The management had put out a corporate loan watch list of Rs34,776 crore in March and at that time, analysts were comforted by the quantum given the lenders huge loan book size. But 60% of SBIs slippages have come from outside its watch list. While the list is now down to Rs25,951 crore, it is not sufficient to look at it excluding the larger book. A quarter of the watch list has already slipped, much of it stemming from the weak sectors like construction, roads, and iron and steel. Asset quality of its mid-corporate segment and small and medium enterprises hasnt stabilized for over a year now.Given that SBI would soon be a bigger behemoth after the merger of its associates, a look at the consolidated balance sheet is a must. The picture gets worse as the bad loan ratios of its associates are massive and their combined gross NPA ratio was 13.77% for the quarter and that of SBI was 7.41%. All of its five associates were loss-making for the six months ended September. By the very nature of its vast franchise and size, SBI would command a premium to its other peers.

				TCS, which ended with $16.5 billion in revenue last year, has grown more than 3% on a sequential basis in a quarter only three times since October 2014. Worryingly, over these past nine quarters, it last reported an over 10% year-on-year growth only once, in the January-March 2015 period.Mumbai-based TCS saw a 0.3% rise in dollar revenue from the preceding three months, and was up 5.8% from the year-ago period to $4.379 billion in the quarter to December. In rupee terms, third-quarter revenue rose 1.5% to Rs29,735 crore from the preceding three months. In constant currency terms, TCS reported a 2% growth, on account of generating more business from its banking clients in the US.TCSs quarterly profit rose 1.6% sequentially to $1 billion, up 8% from $926 million in the year-ago period.A Bloomberg survey of analysts had estimated the firm to report Rs6,432 crore ($947.49 million) profit on net sales of 29610.5 crore ($4.36 billion).The companys operating margin was 26%, similar to what it was at the end of the July-September period. The management reiterated its commitment to end the year in its stated guidance of 26-28% operating margin.It was a very good quarter, considering traditionally Q3 has a weak demand, said Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chief executive officer, TCS, who is set to take over as chairman of holding company Tata Sons on 21 February. I dont expect Q4 to be anything different than in the past. As of now, based on what information I have, I believe it (Q4) should be on expected lines.Chandrasekaran downplayed concerns over a clamp down on H-1B visas, critical to software firms such as TCS, in the context of the new administration in the US and said the company is well prepared to cope with any increase in wages for its US employees or a lowering of the visa ceiling.I cannot comment on the margin impact; but since 2015, we have been preparing ourselves to work in a visa-constrained environment.

Earlier this month, a legislation demanding that outsourcing firms pay at least $100,000 a year to employees who work in the US was introduced in the US Congress.TCS does not give a quarterly or yearly guidance, and the companys underperformance in the nine months of the current year means it will at-best report a 6% dollar revenue growth, lower than the 7.1% growth reported last year.TCS has added $786 million in incremental revenue from April to December this year against $783 million in new business in the first nine months of 2015-16. Significantly, for the first time since TCS went public in 2004, its annual growth will be less than or at best on par with Accenture Plc., which is double the size of the Mumbai-based firm. Accenture grew 6% in the year to August last year (Accenture follows September-August as financial year), helped by  15 acquisitions , which brought 2 percentage points of overall 10.5% constant currency growth. TCS has shied away from buying companies.It is status quonothing materially different than the second quarter. It is important to note that expectations are already so low that even if the company meets the low end of these expectations, it is considered to be a decent show, said a Mumbai-based analyst at a domestic brokerage, on condition of anonymity.At the heart of TCSs underperformance is its inability to build a stronger consulting practice and the managements reluctance to buy small hi-tech firms. TCS also faces some client-specific challenges. Nonetheless, TCS said its digital business in the third quarter rose 6.6% on a sequential basis and 30.2% over the year-ago period to $737 million, or 16.8% of its quarterly revenue.Its revenue from banking, financial services and insurance firms, which accounts for 40% of total revenue, reported a 2.1% increase in constant currency terms. TCS reported a 2.2% improvement in the US, which accounts for 55% of total revenue.

0.44,"India remains attractive for foreign investors despite the imminent interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve and UKs decision to leave the European Union, John Woods, chief investment officer for Asia-Pacific at Credit Suisse Private Banking, said in an interview. Edited excerpts:
				   
				In January, you had written that you are neutral about India as the growth and reform potentials are still suppressed by political factors. Has your view changed since then? We are cautiously constructive on India from a fundamental perspective. We know it is one of the fastest growing economies among the major economies. We are positive about its valuations. We think capital inflows into India is likely to accelerate as the focus on emerging markets continues. Thats why we are overweight on India within our asset allocation for the Asia-Pacific region and just recently turned overweight on China as well. We are recommending these two markets to our clients.Some people say the Indian equity market is overvalued.We were looking at the price earnings ratio for the next year, which is at around 16 times. For us, that is not particularly expensive. It is not particularly cheap either. It is fairly priced. The problem seems to be consumer-related stocks are quite expensive and capital consumption stocks are quite cheap. What we would like to see certainly is greater evidence of growth in the manufacturing and industrial sector, greater evidence of capital expenditure and therefore profitability growth. That would paint a more balanced picture of the choices open to investors.What are your growth projections for India?We are looking at GDP growth of 7.8% and 8% for next year. We expect the Sensex to close this year at around 28,500. We got a pretty positive outlook for next year. We are looking at 30,500, equivalent of 10% growth from current level, which would be a record high for the Sensex. We are absolutely positive on the equity story.What makes you so bullish about India?It is the fundamental story relative to the rest of Asia that is actually quite attractive. It has a growth rate most economies will die for. It has quite a positive story on consumer spending, which pretty much the rest of Asia is also seeking to expand as well. The reality is we have a positive forecast for a large number of countries in Asia because we think the emerging markets will continue to benefit from the inflows from developed markets. We have seen evidence of some of those inflows already. 2016 has been a great year for a number of emerging markets, particularly based in Asia. Our forecast is a combination of our views on dollar, on commodity prices, on interest rates and domestic factors as well.So, how will a US Fed interest rate hike change those assumptions?We think the Fed will hike interest rate in December, but we only anticipate one or two hikes next year. In other words, it is going to be a very shallow trajectory. That is pretty positive for emerging markets. It means dollar is likely to stay soft, liquidity continues to seek yield and carry. They will continue to be attracted towards economies like India, which offers both yield and carry. In May 2013, we saw the taper tantrum and we saw foreign investors attack India because it had quite unmarked external imbalance in terms of its current account deficit. Thats corrected quite dramatically since then. Foreign exchange reserves have improved quite substantially since then. The economy itself has got a much better reputation among foreign investors due to the liberalization programme.But what are the risks for emerging markets like India?The risks are focused on unexpected spike in inflation in the US because of rise in commodity prices. Then we have to start repricing the Fed, the US dollar, the term structure of bond yields and that would have quite profound effect because then the US will become the yield and carry story and all the money that were seeking carry and yield in emerging markets will go back. But the important point is we are seeing an end to deflation. The last two years or so, the global economy was hammered by deflation. Chinas latest PPI (producers price index) was for the first time positive in five years. As you know people have been accusing China of exporting deflation to the global economy, that has now ended. So we are seeing more signs of positive inflation, which leads to positive sales growth, improved profitability, improved earnings and a healthier stock market. Thats the kind of virtuous cycle that shapes emerging markets such as India.But do you think Brexit has been priced in completely by the investors?The positive effect of Brexit has certainly been priced in. As you know there were a lot of dooms day predictors. They have been proven wrong. Unemployment is now extremely low, the PMIs (purchasing price indices) are extremely high, the stock exchange is getting higher and higher, sterling itself is a great shock absorber. The UK has one of the highest current account deficits among the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries and 20-30% correction in sterling is a very good way of correcting that imbalance. The medium term implications of Brexit are uncertain. But the UK has a huge trade deficit with the EU. So I cant see it necessarily why it is in the EUs interest to burn its bridges with one of its important markets in the world. So I do think there will be mutually beneficial agreement ultimately because both parties want access to each others markets.The government is exploring ways to deal with the bad loans in public sector banks. Do you think a bad bank will be an effective tool in Indian context?In principle, recapitalizing the banking system through the vehicle of bad bank makes perfect sense. If your banking system is unable to extend credit because it is too focused on repairing its capital adequacy and provisioning for its non-performing loans, then how will the economy grow? How can credit be extended particularly to the manufacturing sector and it is one of the problems facing India right now. So the idea to create a vehicle to recapitalize the financial sector by taking out the impaired assets and thereby improving the quality of the balance sheet clearly is a very good idea. The devil always is in the detail. How do you actually do that? Who takes the hit? Should shareholders pay up or should the government pay up? In China, for example, that was originally done at face value.Do you agree with the IMF assessment that credit is growing at a dangerous pace in China and its economy risks an eventual disruptive adjustment?We dont think there will be a credit event in China over the next year because there is an extremely important national Peoples party congress in October 2017 and it is our view that until that meeting happens, the government will continue to provide support and cushion any downturn in economic growth. We have in fact upgraded Chinas economic growth to 6.5% this year and 6.3% in 2017 (from 6% earlier). So not only do we not see a hard-landing, we actually see some evidence of economic acceleration vis-à-vis our previous forecast.10-India has proposed a BRICS credit rating agency as it thinks the current rating system is quite biased against developing countries. Do you agree? Do you see scope for another rating agency?I think it is a fantastic idea. Any effort to provide independent, impartial view of an operating environment through the rating of individual companies can only increase transparency of a business environment. The problem that comes up is how impartial this rating will be? Can I trust the quality of the rating and that clearly has to take time. Initially, there will be some caution and wait and see attitude among investors whether the quality of this credit analysis replicates other rating agencies. But the big problem that I see is when you have a niche rating agency, foreign investors are unable to make a rating assessment at a global level based on a consistent set of rating methodology.",2016-10-25,y93PTvzUvdnZZYE9ZPmK4L,"Capital inflows into India likely to accelerate as focus on emerging markets continues, says Credit Suisses John Woods",01:27,"Sensex could touch  30,500 points in 2017: John Woods"

				Provisions and contingencies surged 755% to Rs2,074.94 crore in the July-September quarter from Rs242.70 crore a year earlier. The loss during the second quarter was restricted due to a tax write-back of Rs197.12 crore against tax expenses of Rs189.87 crore a year ago.This is one of the biggest losses reported by an associate bank of the State Bank of India (SBI). In the April-June period, State Bank of Travancore had reported a loss of Rs743 crore due to deteriorating asset quality concerns.The drop in profitability of associate banks might be a result of the impending merger with State Bank of India, which has been approved by all of them. In August, the respective boards of SBI, State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Travancore, State Bank of Hyderabad and Bharatiya Mahila Bank had all approved the mega merger, which will create a large banking conglomerate in India. According to a Mint analysis, this will put SBI in the ranks of the top 50 lenders in the world.The associate banks reported large losses as a direct result of the asset quality review (AQR) conducted by RBI in the October-December period last year, SBI management had stated earlier.Their AQR was very different from ours and this was required in order to align our books, so that when it (merger) happens, there are no surprises. All of the associate banks, going forward, will come back to form. This was the first quarter and maybe there will be another quarter (of pain) and then they will come back to form.

				The dynastic business that built a reputation over more than a century for discretion, integrity and fair-dealing has sunk into a public spat of allegations and name-calling. Its directors trade barbs. Its share price is tumbling. And on Friday, executives were jostled in the street while security staff engaged in an unseemly brawl outside Bombay House, the groups revered headquarters.How did it come to this?The drama dissecting Tata Sons, Indias largest industrial group, revolves around Ratan Tata, scion of a family that built an empire so diverse that it writes financial software for Goldman Sachs Group Inc., sells pick-up trucks in Uganda and offers packaged salt to Indian families at Rs.18 a kilo.Two weeks ago, Ratan Tata threw the group into confusion and the public spotlight after the Tata Sons board sacked his successor as chairman, Cyrus Mistry, and wrested back control for the 78-year-old. Neither Tata nor any other board member or major investor has suggested that Mistry financially mismanaged the group. He remains head of many of the affiliate companies, such as Tata Motors and Tata Steel.Instead, Mistrys ouster was the result of growing discontent from Tata, who ran the company for two decades, at what he considered was an undermining of the Tata brand, according to people who have worked with both and asked not to be named because the matter is private.Egos have been bruised, said Harsh Goenka, chairman of RPG Group, another Mumbai-based conglomerate. He said the Tata name stands for humility, humaneness, benevolence, grace and boldness of vision, and it has been dented by the current conflict.Since Mistrys removal as group chairman, Tatas more than two dozen listed companies have lost in excess of $8 billion in market value. Ratan Tata didnt respond to a recent request for an interview.Brand TataTatas adherence to the idea of the brand being a byword for integrity has run throughout his career, according to interviews with more than a dozen people who have worked with him. Banks would routinely do business based on Tatas word, and once he committed to doing something, he would see it through no matter what, said a person with knowledge of some of his deals.When Tata Steel bid for Corus Plc in 2006, it arranged financing with three banks for around $5 billion to $6 billion, said the person, who asked not to be named because the negotiations were private. As the price rose in a bidding war for the European steelmaker, Tata officials found cheaper funding, but would have to pay a break fee with the original banks of about £80 million ($99 million). Some executives tried to negotiate a cheaper release, but when the matter was brought to the attention of Ratan Tata, he insisted the original contract be honoured, the person said.Tatas decision echoes the groups current spat with Japanese telecommunication partner NTT Docomo Inc., which is one of the key battlegrounds in the war of words between Tata and Mistry. Docomo is trying to enforce a London Court of International Arbitration decision ordering Tata Sons to pay $1.17 billion for failing to uphold a contract, signed during Ratan Tatas 21-year period at the helm.A Tata Sons spokesman declined to comment while Mistrys office referred to a 1 November statement on the companys partnership with NTT Docomo.Tata became frustrated at Mistrys seeming reluctance to pay, which reflected on the Tata name, according to people familiar with the case. In an email to the directors after his removal, Mistry said it was the board that has not covered itself with glory, by the way he was dismissed.Family codeBut the Tata family code, rigorously pursued by Ratan Tatas predecessor, the legendary industrialist, aviator and philanthropist J.R.D. Tata, extends far beyond just sticking to your word.J.R.D., whose portrait looked down from the boardroom wall in Bombay House as Mistry was being ousted, made Tata famous for refusing to pay bribes. He founded many of the businesses that are now key units, such as Tata Motors, and funnelled a large chunk of profits to social programs such as Asias first cancer hospital and the Tata Institute for Social Sciences.He handpicked Ratan, the great grandson via his adopted father of group founder Jamsetji Tata, to carry on that family legacy. Trained as an architect at Cornell University, Ratan began on the shop floor in 1962, stoking Tata Steels blast furnaces, before gaining experience in several positions in the group.In 1991, he took over the chairmanship and set about establishing his dominance over group companies, which had become rich and autonomous during J.R.D.s five-decade reign.In the 1990s the Tata Group was ruled by powerful satraps and he very dexterously distanced all of them from their powerful positions and gained total control, said Goenka, chairman of RPG. The one common factor that defines Ratan Tata then and now is that of an astute leader. He eased out Cyrus Mistry from the chairmanship that took India Inc. completely by surprise. If the past was about a loud war cry, the present is about stealth.During his first chairmanship, Tata expanded the company rapidly, often by acquisition, turning a predominately India business into a global group with $103 billion in salesahead of Gazprom and International Business Machines Corp. He also sowed the seeds for many of the groups current troubles, including the purchase of Corus, the venture with Docomo and the ill-fated Nano car project.Since about 2004, with the question of his succession looming, Tata gradually increased his control in the operations of the group, said a person who worked closely with both Mistry and Tata. He took major decisions with less board consultation than previously, the person said.Ratan Tata has always consulted senior executives in all his decisions, including the Corus acquisition, said a Tata official, who asked not to be identified citing company rules.New successorThe eventual choice for a successor was Mistry, the son of one of the biggest shareholders in Tata Sons, his own brother-in-law and a fellow member of the Parsi communitythe isolated followers of Zoroastrianism whose ancestors fled to India from Persia a millennium ago.With Mistry deposed, Tata is back at the helm promising to find a new successor before March. Next month he will be 79.I do not think Ratan Tata has any option other than to hold on to the position that he has taken back, whether he likes it or not, said Kavil Ramachandran, executive director of the Thomas Schmidheiny Centre for Family Enterprise at the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad. In the interest of every stakeholder, he has to take steps to get the situation back on track.While Ratan took the groups products to more than 100 countries, he retained the ethos of his predecessors, that in building a business you are also helping to build India.Nano InspirationThe Nano was inspired by seeing an Indian family riding on a motorbike in the rain. It epitomized Ratan Tatas qualitieshis vision and attention to detail, as well as his stubbornness and reluctance to terminate a key business thats losing money.Tata spent hours with the Nano development team, focusing on getting every detail right for the most anticipated auto release of 2008, said a person who worked on the project. Yet the car was marketed as cheap, a stigma that was reinforced by dealers who had little interest in pushing a low-margin vehicle.When Mistry led the introduction of Tata Motors latest modelthe unfortunately named Zica hatchback, rechristened Tiagohis main concern was how to ensure the car would be profitable, according to the person who worked with both Mistry and Tata, and asked not to be identified as hes not authorized to speak to the media. Mistry talked to staff about what he, and even his children, thought of the marketing campaign and what needed fixing, the employee said.Ratan Tatas vision for the group was a globally diversified and successful conglomerate with some distinctive values, said Rishikesha T. Krishnan, director and professor of strategic management at the Indian Institute of Management Indore. Cyrus Mistry did not dismantle that vision, but he appears to have been particularly concerned about the viability of different businesses.If something went wrong, Tata would tell you to your face and then take immediate steps to rectify the problem, said a senior Tata Sons executive who has known Ratan Tata for more than two decades. He described Tata as a humanist with a deep sense of compassion, who was keen on products that fostered social justice like the Nano, or Tata Salt.In 2012, after grooming Mistry for the top job for a year, Tata stepped down as group chairman, and moved from his relatively modest apartment to a white, three-story house he built on the seafront near the exclusive Colaba neighbourhood of Mumbai, with a private gym and rooftop infinity pool looking out over the Arabian Sea, according to local newspaper reports.Start-up InvestingHe threw his energies into working with entrepreneurs, investing nominal sums in more than three dozen startups ranging from artificial intelligence to online sales of womens lingerie.Those who met him spoke of his imposing presence, graciousness and attention to detail in how ideas would work.Mr Tata. listens intently, has a curiosity to learn and often gives a fresh perspective that hasnt been considered, said Vani Kola, head of venture capital fund Kalaari Capital. He notices the smallest things, he puts people at ease.At the same time, he continued to keep any eye on the Tata Group as head of the powerful family trusts that hold a majority stake in Tata Sons. According to several people who know Tata, he became increasingly frustrated by what was happening to the company that bore his name.On 24 October, before the board meeting in Bombay House, where stray dogs are allowed to roam the corridors, Mistry was told of the decision to remove him.Cyrus Mistry was handpicked by Ratan Tata, said Goenka. This time he will look for someone who understands the Tata culture and the Tata way of doing things, better. Bloomberg",2016-11-08,ylJCy9morUM9QsY5DRkqhN,"Tata group, the dynastic business that built a reputation over more than a century for discretion, integrity and fair-dealing has sunk into a public spat of allegations and name-calling",11:24,Ratan Tatas return as interim chairman seen taking toll on Brand Tata 
0.19,"Mumbai: Reserve Bank of India (RBI), on Thursday released draft guidelines on interest rate risk on banking book (IRRBB), seeking public comments on the same, by 3 March.
				   
				IRRBB refers to the current or prospective risk to a banks capital and earnings arising from adverse movements in interest rates that affect banking book positions. When interest rates change, the present value and timing of future cash flows change. This in turn changes the underlying value of a banks assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items and hence its economic value. Changes in interest rates also affect a banks earnings by altering interest rate-sensitive income and expenses, affecting its net interest income (NII). Excessive IRRBB can pose a significant threat to a banks current capital base and/or future earnings if not managed appropriately, the central bank said in its draft.ALSO READ:  An RBI rate cut at next weeks monetary policy review isnt a givenAs a part of Basel-III capital regulations, banks are required to identify the risks associated with the changing interest rates on its balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures in the banking book from both, short- term and long-term perspective. Banks can also decide, with the approval of the board, on the appropriate level of interest rate risk in the banking book, which they would like to carry keeping in view their capital level, interest rate management skills and the ability to re-balance the banking book portfolios quickly in case of adverse movement in the interest rates.As part of the draft guidelines, RBI said that banks where the economic value of equity is equal to or higher than 15% of their respective Tier-I capitals in stress scenarios, will be considered to be having materially high IRRBB and RBI may ask these banks to either reduce their exposure to IRRBB or enhance their capital base.",2017-02-02,z8fmj6GjWfmLPay83ZUVRP,"Excessive IRRBB (interest rate risk on banking book) can pose a significant threat to a banks current capital base and/or future earnings if not managed appropriately, the RBI said",22:22,RBI issues draft guidelines on interest rate risk on banking book
-0.42,"A day after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) released its biannual Financial Stability Report, outlining the significant challenges being faced by Indian banks, 31 of 33 big banks in the US cleared the final round of the Federal Reserves annual stress tests, signifying the resilience of the US financial system.
				   
				Only one of the largest banks of the USMorgan Stanleygot a conditional passing grade and two others, Deutsche Bank AG and Santander Bank NA, both US subsidiaries of European banks, failed. In the previous year too, the duo did not qualify.The stress tests essentially gauge whether the banks in the US with at least $50 billion in assets each have enough capital, management bandwidth and other safeguards to survive a financial crisis. Ahead of the stress tests results on 29 June, the Fed had said that all big banks would be able to make it through a recession. Since the global financial crisis in the aftermath of the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in September 2008, the banks have been directed to create a cushion of large capital against likely losses from a recession or any other developments that shock the market. The 29 June statement has also outlined areas where the Fed expects further improvement next year.The RBI stress test, on the other hand, indicates that risks to the banking sector increased significantly in the second half of 2015-16, driven by deteriorating asset quality and lower profitability. Indeed, the financial system is resilient but it could become vulnerable if the macroeconomic conditions deteriorate sharply.ALSO READ:
 S4A wont solve the bad loans problem

Saddled with bad assets, the banks are expected to remain risk-averse and not lend money to corporations; besides, in the absence of adequate capital, their ability to lend will also be impacted.Simply put, Indian banks are caught in a vicious cycle: They are not willing to lend for fear of adding to bad assets; this dents their interest income and profitability; and that, in turn, further erodes their ability to lend as they are not able to plough back profits to bolster their capital.The credit growth of Indian banks slowed to 8.8% in March 2016 from 9.4% in September 2015; the growth in deposits too declined from 9.9% to 8.1% during this period.The gross non-performing assets (NPAs) as a percentage of advances rose to 7.6% from 5.1% and, overall, the proportion of stressed advances rose to 11.5% from 11.3%. After setting aside money, the net NPAs of banks rose sharply, from 2.8% to 4.6%, between September and March. On every parameter, the state-owned banks are in a far worse shape than their private peers.In March, the top 100 borrowers accounted for almost 28% of credit to all large borrowers and little over 16% of Rs.75.3 trillion bank credit. They also accounted for more than one-fifth of the gross NPAs of the Indian banking system.The RBI stress test suggests that gross NPAs of the banking system may rise to 9.3% by March 2017 under a severe stress scenario. For the state-owned banks, it could be as high as 11%. Higher bad assets will force banks to set aside more money, dent their profitability, and they would need capital infusion to be able to support the demand of loan from the corporate borrowers.Unlike the US Federal Reserve, which identifies the banks that fail the stress tests, the Indian banking regulator does not expose individual banks and rightly so, as this could lead to a run on a bank with a large number of depositors rushing to withdraw money simultaneously, due to concerns about the particular banks solvency. In such a scenario, the money kept by a bank with RBI in the form of cash reserve ratio as well as the government bond holdingwhich could be liquidated to generate cashmay not be enough to cover the deposit withdrawals. RBI prefers to talk in terms of number of banks at risk and not who they are. For instance, stress tests on banks credit concentration risks, it says, is significant for eight banks, accounting for a little over 12% of advances, and they may end up having capital less than what they require.ALSO READ:

Since 2010 when the first signs of stress were seen, the government has pumped in Rs.67,734 crore capital to keep the public sector banks running. It has agreed to infuse an additional Rs.70,000 crore even as the state-owned banks will have to raise over Rs.1 trillion from the markets to meet their capital requirements. Media reports suggest that the finance ministry has already finalized the plan for the first round of capital infusion of around Rs.10,000 crore. After pumping in Rs.25,000 crore in 21 state-owned banks last fiscal year, the government has committed to offer Rs.25,000 crore capital to these banks in the current year and another Rs.10,000 crore each in 2018 and 2019.For the big US banks and their investors, the annual stress tests are extremely critical as those who pass the grade are entitled to pay dividends and buy back stocks from their shareholders. In the Indian context, such a test still largely remains an academic exercise as the government seems to believe in a perpetual unconditional bailout theory.In the thick of global financial turmoil, the US Treasury announced a Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, of up to $700 billion to save its privately managed banks from the so-called subprime mortgage crisis. Most of this amount has been invested, loaned or paid out by the Treasury and the banks have returned more in the form of interest, dividend and fees. The band-aid approach that India follows will keep the system alive but one cannot expect a turnaround till such time the government accepts that capital infusion is just one of the tools and it needs to do more to revive the weak banks. Meanwhile, wary of corporate credit, now they are chasing retail loans; the trend will continue till they burn their fingers.ALSO READ:

0.74,"Nandan Nilekani, former chairman of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), says India has a unique edge over other countries when it comes to payment systems in the battle for supremacy in the fintech resolution. Nilekanis observation comes at a time the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is preparing to launch an upgraded version of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), called UPI 2.0, by early next year. Nilekani, who serves as an honorary adviser to NPCI on innovation and public policy and was one of the key brains behind UPI, said that once some of the teething issues with the current version of UPI are sorted out, the system will be ready to take off in a big way, especially in e-commerce. In an interview, he spoke about how UPI was created in the first place, the role played by the likes of NPCI and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its development, and whats next for UPI. Edited excerpts:
How was UPI conceptualized in the first place and how did you go about building it?The foundation of UPI is really the highly successful IMPS (Immediate Payment Service) that NPCI launched five-six years agoaround 2011. This was a remarkable innovation because for the first time it gave you 24x7 instant credit. For example, in a very short period of time, in less than five years, the volume on IMPS has gone to Rs24,000 crore a month and it has become the de facto way of doing remittances in India. Thats the great success story that NPCI created and is really the first product to do instant credit. But it couldnt be used for merchant payments because for that you need instant debit Then some of us got together and were discussing that with the rise of smartphones, there was a need to build on the success of IMPS and to build something which was world-class, could do both credit and debit, smartphone-to-smartphone, etc. Then NPCI appointed me as an honorary adviser on innovation and public policy so that I could share my inputs and entered into an MoU (memorandum of understanding) with iSpirt (software product industry lobby group)... This all happened in late 2014. Then in February 2015, we had the launch of UPI by (RBI) governor (Raghuram) Rajan, who was always a big supporter of the idea. It took them a year to get the software built by RS Software, etc. So it was basically built as a layer on top of IMPS with debit. And then all these great innovations came, like virtual payment address (VPA), push-and-pull payments, etc.all that was the work of the iSpirt and NPCI teams... It took us more than a year to get it done. Then the actual launch happened in April 2016. Then another two-three months to test out everything and get all the banks going. And finally they went live about a month ago.What were some of the triggers behind the creation of UPI?We felt we were in a unique position because there was an organization like NPCI which was a very strong organization on payments, set up by the banks and owned collectively by the banks. And this organization had come into being coincidentally around the same time as UIDAIboth came up in 2009. There has been a very close working relationship between UIDAI and NPCI, which led to the creation of Aadhaar payment bridge, etc. Since it was a bank-owned utility, it was well-geared to offer an interoperable system. RBI was supportive, not just the governor but also the department of payments.How is UPI different from other payment systems in countries like the US and China?In the US and China, its like a walled garden where a couple of key players control the system. For example, in China you have the likes of WeChat and AliPay. With UPI, anyone can build on top of it and innovateits open and inclusive. Its almost like being on a highway without any toll gates.Whats your assessment of where UPI is at right now? What are some of the things that still need to be fixed?This is a mammoth task taking a countrys payments system and make it go into the completely 21st century online real time...across smartphones, fully secure, encrypted, virtual payment addresses, etc. This is a major thingthere are bound to be teething issues. There are some teething issues in onboarding customers and so on, but I think its all par for the course. Itll take a couple of months to settle that down. But as more banks like SBI (State Bank of India) and HDFC (Bank) come online, more and more of Indias banking terms will be on UPI. And then once all these teething issues are sorted out, Im very confident itll take off because it is such a superior value proposition. Both for online and offline merchant payments and both for online B2B (business to business) payments.Whats next for UPI? What should we expect in the next 6-12 months?The idea is that in the next couple of months all the technical issues, all the onboarding issues, all the user interface issues would have been shaken outany concerns that people have. All the banks will be live. All the major merchants should be live. There will be a few hundred thousand customers who will be ready to transact with their VPAs and apps. And there will be choice for consumers to select very attractive apps from a number of banks. Once you have that, you have the ground conditions for take-off. My sense is that the first take-off will happen in the online, e-commerce world. And then the same thing will migrate to the offline world...The big thing to remember is that in the typical card world, you went from offline to online. In the UPI world, were going from online to offline.",2016-10-12,zV5lj7FoBJ2s1KM8orBEKJ,"UIDAIs former boss Nandan Nilekani on the origins of Unified Payments Interface, NPCI and RBIs role in its development, and whats next for UPI",03:32,UPI is almost like being on a highway without toll gates: Nandan Nilekani
0.24,"New Delhi: One of the biggest expectations with Union Budget 2017 was that the government would divulge details of how much money has come back to the banking system after demonetisation. While the budget has disappointed in terms of giving overall statistics on this count, it does give an idea about the extent of money which has come in deposits of Rs2 lakh and above.
				   
				This is what Arun Jaitley had to say in his budget speech: After the demonetisation, the preliminary analysis of data received in respect of deposits made by people in old currency presents a revealing picture. During the period 8th November to 30th December 2016, deposits between Rs2 lakh and Rs80 lakh were made in about 1.09 crore accounts with an average deposit size of Rs5.03 lakh. Deposits of more than 80 lakh were made in 1.48 lakh accounts with average deposit size of Rs3.31 crores.Union Budget 2017: Key highlights and themesThe total amount which has been deposited under these two categories can be calculated by multiplying the number of accounts with the average deposit figures mentioned by Jaitley. This gives a figure of Rs5.48 lakh crores for deposits worth less than Rs80 lakh and Rs4.89 lakh crore for more than Rs80 lakh. The aggregate deposits under the two categories amount to Rs10.38 lakh crore. This works out to around two-third of the total value of demonetised currency, which was valued at around 15.44 lakh crore. These figures also tell us that around 31% of total value of demonetised currency has come back in individual deposits of Rs80 lakh or more. These figures show that a large chunk of the demonetised currency which has come back into banks is from the super-rich.How much of the deposits reflect unearthed black money?According to Jaitley, there are more than 3 lakh companies which show profits. There are 76 lakh individuals who report annual income greater than Rs5 lakh. Out of this 56 lakh individuals belong to the salaried class, which means that their avenues for tax evasion are extremely limited. The rest 20 lakh individuals include businessmen and professionals.It is possible that several of the high-deposit accounts belong to those who are already in the tax net, and have legitimate reasons for holding on to cash. The finance minister has not said anything about whether these are individual or business accounts. In the latter category, a lot of cash could be classified as cash in hand for business purposes, and it would be difficult to say whether these deposits reflect unearthed black money.However these numbers point to one unequivocal conclusion: most of the super-rich did not flush their cash stocks down the pit. Instead, they have chosen to park their money with banks, fully aware that this might invite scrutiny from taxmen. It is therefore likely that they will have good answers ready if and when the taxmen come to ask questions. There is very little reason to hope that the post-demonetisation data mining exercise will help unearth a significant amount of black money. This should not come as a surprise to those who have taken even a cursory look at the findings of taxmen on black money, who have reported in the past that cash is the least preferred way of holding unaccounted money.",2017-02-01,zhdFUJDvLzNJNFe0puDjbO,"About Rs10.38 lakh crore in demonetised currency was deposited in 2.57 lakh bank accounts, showing that a large chunk of the amount came from the super-rich",21:08,Arun Jaitleys budget speech gives clues about demonetisation deposits in banks
0.29,"India is making efforts to set up one more container trans-shipment terminal, closer to the east-west trade lane, with the cabinet approving a facility at Enayam in Tamil Nadu. The success of the latest trans-shipment adventure will squarely rest on getting one of the global top three container shipping lines to become an anchor investor in what is essentially a liner-driven business.
				   
				For that to happen, India needs to revisit its qualification criteria for selecting potential terminal developers at its major portsthose owned by the central government.The evaluation criteria for potential bidders set by the government in 2009 ignores the role played by shipping lines in contributing to the performance of a container terminal let alone a container trans-shipment terminal.In computing the experience score of an applicant to consider it eligible for qualification, experience in core sectors such as power, telecom, ports, airports, railways, metro rail, industrial parks/estates, logistic parks, pipelines, irrigation, water supply, sewerage and real estate development are factored in. Experience in running a shipping line, which brings business to these trans-shipment hubs, is not included.This explains why none of the global container shipping lines are part of container terminals operating at major ports. Since they dont bring any value to the table for qualification purposes, port developers are loath to signing them up as partners.On their own, they dont qualify because shipping is not part of the core sectors drawn up for working out experience scores.Geneva-based Mediterranean Shipping Co. SA (MSC), the worlds second biggest container shipping line, did apply in partnership with Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) in an auction for developing a container terminal project at Jawaharlal Nehru Port a couple of years ago. The APSEZ-MSC team was qualified to bid, but the experience score for that joint venture was counted on the basis of APSEZs credentials.This is not the situation at non-major ports or ports owned by the states but given to private firms for development and operations. For instance, APSEZ, which runs Indias biggest private port at Mundra in Gujarat, has two of the worlds top three container shipping companiesMSC and CMA-CGM SAas partners in two separate terminals.Unlike gateway terminals, trans-shipment facilities are dependent on big container lines, a fact that has been acknowledged globally.Trans-shipment hubs such as the ones located at Tanjung Pelepas in Malaysia and Colombo in Sri Lanka have shown that having a shipping line as anchor investor in the port (Maersk Line in the case of both Tanjung Pelepas and Colombo) is eventually the determinant of success. Making the liner invest in the port makes it a stakeholder in the ports success and, thus, incentivizes it to move existing traffic and establish a minimum scale of operation. The liners are also keen to operate from a port where they have investments since this will enable them to influence port planning decisions and port operations, take long-term bets while planning routes/vessel commissioning decisions and help improve overall cost economics and flexibility on pricing.About 25%, or some 2.8 million twenty foot equivalent units, or TEUs, the standard size of a cargo container, originating from or destined for India, is trans-shipped every year at overseas hubs, en-route to their final destination.Colombo, Singapore and Port Klang (Malysia) handle more than 80% of this cargo. Of this, Colombo alone handles around 1.2 million TEUs, which is a significant loss of revenue for Indias exporters, importers and ports; it builds inefficiencies in logistics and creates risk to the countrys competitiveness in export trade.The shipping ministry says there is a strong economic case for building a new trans-shipment hub in and around the same region to attract Indian and regional trans-shipment traffic from the current hubs. But is it justified?Enayam will be the third container trans-shipment terminal to be located a few kms apart from each other on Indias southern tip. Of this, Vallarpadam in Cochin port has been operational since 2011 without much success. None of the global top three container lines are an anchor investor in the facility, which is also facing multiple hurdles in its efforts to become a major hub as planned.Vizhinjam, also in Kerala, is being developed by APSEZ. There are indications one of the top three global container lines could make Vizhinjam its trans-shipment hub as the qualification rules applicable to major ports will not be relevant here as it is a port outside the control of the centre.APSEZs strong ties with two of the top three container lines at its Mundra port, where one of the container terminalsa joint venture between APSEZ and MSCis undertaking trans-shipment operations, would help make a similar partnership a reality at Vizhinjam. There are several more commercial advantages, including pricing flexibilities that flow from building a trans-shipment hub outside Indian government ownership. Vizhinjam has also secured the key environment clearance, which Enayam is yet to receive. Enayams success, to a great extent, will depend on its ability to convince a major shipping liner to become an anchor client and re-route its traffic from the competing ports, consultants TYPSA and Boston Consulting Group wrote in their techno-economic feasibility report on the Enayam project.Container shipping lines take a long-term view and consider several factors such as minimum deviation from the main trade route, and lower port charges when deciding their preferred trans-shipment port, given the costs of reconfiguring their existing route networks, according to TYPSA and BCG.But, given that Enayam is being developed as a major port like Vallarpadam in Cochin and the consequent applicability of shipping-unfriendly evaluation criteria, it calls for a change in rules.With Indias shipping ministry set to revise a so-called model concession agreement (MCA) for public-private-partnership (PPP) projects at major ports, the time is apt for reviewing the qualification rules. MCA sets the terms and conditions of a port contract.P.
