-0.02,"Pune: The 57-year-old boss of Tech Mahindra, C.P. Gurnani, says that Indian technology outsourcing companies have always transformed themselves in the past and that it will be wrong to write off the countrys $150-billion outsourcing industry even as new technologies disrupt the landscape. In an interview in Pune last week, Gurnani shared the bets Tech Mahindra is making and why he remains confident that the company will be able to remain relevant even as technology fundamentally changes the way companies across industries do business. Edited excerpts:
Analysts and commentators have started penning obituaries for the Indian IT outsourcing industry. From your perch, what is the future of Indian IT and Tech Mahindra? It will be wrong to write us off. I see the present as exciting times. Remember, Indian IT has seen changes all throughout its life. It all started with Father Kohli (F.C. Kohli, the first CEO of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd). The model then was that companies said, we have consultants and we will give them to you. Then the Y2K moment happened, which was like an inflection point.  In all these decades, the industry has grown. So, even now, the focus for Tech Mahindra, and I believe other Indian heritage IT firms, is that you need to make sure we remain relevant. Technology is changing industries around us. My priority No. 1 (is) to make ourselves remain relevant.ALSO READ | Tech Mahindra bets on DAVID strategy to fuel growthSo, how are you making Tech Mahindra stay relevant? Can you also share what are, say, the three big bets for Tech Mahindra? I can tell you not three but five. First is cybersecurity. Second is imaging as a service or say, a service where we use automation platform with radiologist, and run imaging as a service. No. 3 is blockchain. No. 4 is that we want to be the largest system integrator in the Internet of things (IoT). No. 5 is network services, as the world moves towards last-mile connectivity, and focus on software-defined networks (increases).All IT firms are talking about these newer tech. When can we see Tech Mahindra beginning to disclose the business it generates from each of these five big bets?We should be able to do this soon. The way we look at it is that we will take 12-16 months to incubate them. So, out of the five, three will go into production phase. It is possible that not all five will go into production phase. And so, I believe that the three which go into production, it is my duty to report the numbers. I have invested shareholder money and I guess it is the right of the shareholders to know what I have done with their money. So, we should be able to report the revenue or business once it goes into production (phase) after 12-16 months.How different will the Tech Mahindra of 2020 be? Currently, 65% of my business comes from IT while balance comes from engineering services, network services, customer experience, platform and security. Im taking a forward call and saying 50% will come from IT and 50% will come from different platforms by 2020. So, obviously there will be changes.Your thoughts on the internal goal of becoming a $10 billion firm by 2020, and what percentage of revenue will be called digital by then? Will it be more than half of your revenue, as against the 15-7% currently? Will it mean significant revenue from M&A?I cannot comment on the Internal  goals. But on your question of digital revenue, I would say that the way market is moving, getting more than 50% you see is not relevant. Because if I get the topline, I promise you, we will have more than 50% (coming from) digital.One of the things which is often held against Indian heritage IT firms is that they are too conservative. You are talking about blockchain. But if you are serious, then why not launch a service line? Take a more aggressive approach like the one adopted by IBM, which has set up business focused on blockchain technologies.I cannot comment on what approach other companies are taking. Im not betting my company on any one technology. If you look at my company, 65% of business which comes from traditional IT will change to 50% by 2020. So, I will still get 50% from IT. So, Im not betting my whole ranch on this. blockchain for all you know will be $200 million practice, say, for us when Im $8 billion or $9 billion. So, are you saying that there is enough in traditional business?I am not saying this. All I am saying is that my companys focus remains and will be in solving business problems. I will choose the technology. Im not getting married to one technology. And that is the difference between service and product companies. Tech Mahindra is perceived to be lagging behind in digital technologies. It does not have a strong consultancy arm, for instance. You are wrong when you say I dont have a strong consultancy arm. I have about 3,000 consultants. I have probably what is the largest IT telecom services firm out of India being a leader for the last 10 years and I will be the leader for the next 10 years. From the positioning point of view, I have taken a position:  I will be largest IT  firm in the media, communication and entertainment industry.

0.59,"Singapore: Tsk tsk. What an unnecessary sacrifice of an heir apparent. Just because SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son was having too much fun running his investment empire to give up the reins, chosen successor Nikesh Arora has packed his bags, sold his stock and prepared to depart, even without a destination in mind.
				   
				But why? Son is 58, and former Google executive Arora a mere 48. Considering Warren Buffett is still soldiering on at 85, Son leaving at 60 to spend more time with Pepper, SoftBanks $2,000 robot, would have been a shame. As for the younger mans burning ambition to be his own boss, that could have been mollified with a mix of poetic inspiration and real-world evidence.In the circumstances, John Miltons When I Consider How My Light Is Spent would have been the ideal encouragement. The sonnets last line, They also serve who only stand and wait, could have made a nice office poster for Arora. The fortitude of Florentino Ariza, who waited 51 years, 9 months and 4 days to be united with the love of his life in Love in the Time of Cholera, could have provided reinforcement. In the meantime, Arora might have considered leaving a copy of W. B. Yeatss Sailing to Byzantium lying around for Son. The poems opening line, That is no country for old men, still resonates.Also Read: The trigger for Nikesh Aroras SoftBank resignation

If Arora is less easily persuaded by world literature than by hard numbers, then there are plenty of those, too. A Bloomberg Gadfly analysis of publicly listed companies with a market value of more than $10 billion throws up more than 100 that have executive chairman and chief executive posts occupied by different people, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. On average, the executive chairmanwho usually gets the better officeis 11 years older than the CEO, whos 56.Pointing to that list, Son could have taught Arora some of the finer points of playing second fiddle. Companies as diverse as Next, Expedia, Marriott, Discovery Communications, Dassault, Charles Schwab, Constellation Brands, BNP Paribas, Nike, KDDI and Nippon Telegraph all have CEOs who have been around anywhere between three and 21 years, and who still take orders from above. At Twenty-First Century Fox, CEO James Murdoch, 43, has elder brother Lachlan Murdoch, 44, as executive chairman, father Rupert Murdoch, 85, as non-executive chairman and Chase Carey, 62, as vice-chairman. Thats almost as crowded an affair as X-Men: Apocalypse.Also Read: Nikesh Arora resigns from SoftBank as Masayoshi Son sticks on as CEO

A continued Son-Arora JV could have been less fraught, something like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. In a few decades, SoftBank could have blossomed to a Buffett and Charlie Munger-type partnership, with Son and Arora finishing each others sentences.Alas, it wasnt to be. SoftBank shares rose as much as 3.9% on Wednesday partly because Son, founder of the Internet and mobile-phone giant, is staying in charge. The relief may be short term. Not only has Son lost the man who spearheaded SoftBanks investments in e-commerce startups in Asia, hes also lost a fail-safe for the day when thinking about the next billion-dollar business wont hold the same appeal as stealing a little more time with Pepper.

0.69,"Akash Gupta is co-founder and chief technology officer at GreyOrange, a robotics firm founded in 2011 along with his friend and partner Samay Kohli, who is the chief executive officer.  In an interview, Gupta talks about the journey of GreyOrange and its future plans. Edited excerpts:
				   
				Tell us something about your background and how you got interested in robotics.
Samay and I met at BITS Pilani. He is two years my senior and we met during a human robotics project where we were trying to build robots, got interested in human robotics, built the AcYut and took part in a lot of competitions all around the world, represented India in the human robotics competitions. The ROBOlympics (now RoboGames) happens in San Francisco every year so the first time we came sixth, then got the bronze and then finally got the gold. We took part in the midsize humanoid category, which is basically where a human-looking robot, about a metre in height, is involved in a kung fu competition with another robot. These robots are remote-controlled. Then, we gradually started building autonomous humanoid robots to take part in a soccer competition for robots. So we added vision, so that the robots could kick the ball, and take their own autonomous decisions while playing. After this, we got requests for giving workshops/tutorials on humanoid robotics. Humanoid as a project is very expensive as it costs Rs40-45 lakh a year on three robots, so there was no option but to raise funds for the same. For this purpose, we formed a company and called it GreyOrange. We did about 35-40 workshops in 2011 and were enjoying ourselves but soon figured out this was not something we wanted to do in the long-term. So we shifted from doing workshops to doing product development for different companies like C&C Technologies in the US and some South Korean companies. But we were not getting good at anything because the products were from different domains. We realized that we were not building any core competency, so both Samay and I thought that we should try to focus on one particular industry. So we did some research, had some industries in mind for automation like the railways, which is highly non-automated, oil and gas maintenance, and  e-commerce and warehousing. The problem with the first two industries was that they were very slow at that time while e-commerce was developing, so we chose that industry to start  building products. At that point of time we also met Wolfgang Hoeltgen in Germany in one of the science and technology fairs at Hanover, and he really liked our idea and provided us with angel funding. In January 2012, we took our first office in Gurgaon and spent about Rs55 lakh on hardware prototyping and that was a really good decision because it helped our product development capability more than what anything else would have done. We started with two products: the butler system and sortation system, and fast forward to today where we have more than 500 people, three product lines (the butler system, linear sortation and cross-belt sortation), 50-plus installations.Describe your products and how they help automate warehouses?
Linear sortation systems are used to sort shipments. One of the major use case is once your shipments are picked and packed, they need to be sorted according to destinations or locations, because then they need to catch corresponding trucks or flights, so our sortation systems helps you sort that and also capture the volumetric and weight of the packetthis is required for billing for the courier company.Linear sortation system is like a conveyor machine that has arms that help in sorting packages and have different throughput which means the number of packets that can be sorted and weighed in an hour. So the machine can sort from 1,500 packets an hour to about 14,000 an hour. You can also use this system to combine different items in orders. What the butler system does is when an order is placed, then somebody takes a pick-list and picks the ordered objects from different parts of the warehouse, comes back, sorts them, packs them and sends them. The butler makes the picking, putting combining very, very easy. What it does is it completely transforms the paradigm from man going to the goods to goods coming to the man. In the butler system, the people stand at the periphery of the warehousewe call these pick-put stationsand the bots basically bring the racks to them for whatever they need to pick. Bots will then go and store the racks back to their location. So lets say in an apparel industry 120-180 items per day can be picked manually, the butler system can pick 300-600 items in an hourthats the kind of jump we are talking about in the throughput of the warehouse.  The whole process is really dynamic and the order goes directly to our server and the server directs the robots. This has reduced pilferage too, as we have limited the interaction of people to the periphery. What are your future plans and strategy?
There is a lot of innovation you can drive through these products, every six months we are driving new features, improving speed, giving more customization to our clients. There is room for a lot of optimization, efficiency and accuracy, so we are constantly working on that.  We have one major R&D (research and development) office in Gurgaon, but we have service centres across India. We are expanding to South-East Asia. We have an office in Singaporethere is a 14-people team that looks at solutions, marketing, sales. South-East Asia is a big market and since the past 12 months we are going aggressively into it. We have also invested in a company in Japan that is our exclusive partner for distributing our butler systems in there. So we are in process of installing butler systems in Japan. The Middle East is a growing market with Saudi Arabia, so we have set up an office there and we are starting operations there. We also have a small office in Hong Kong and are now looking to expand to Germany. So now our major impetus is expanding overseas and getting a few anchor clients overseas. As regards the products, we are building newer versions every 6-12 months. We invest heavily in R&D as thats the core of our company. We would like to disrupt our products every three years. We also have people working on R&D from outside India, so they can start contributing to the product since we expect to serve a global market so its important to get perspective from different geographies. We are hiring engineers from Germany and the US, so our R& D team is cross-geography. How do you envision your company 10 years down the line?
We are definitely looking to get public and an IPO (initial public offering) is one of the most viable options to take this forward. But not immediately. One thing we are trying to build at the core is a very strong product engine at the back-end, have a team of people who can produce very complex, good quality hardware plus software products, which is the core of the company. If you build a good product engine, then you can pick any industry and disrupt it by building these products. So we are giving thought to things like product life cycle, processes, how we train our engineers and build products that are reliable, have a high life cycle of 7-10 years, are of international quality and are globally acceptable. That is one of the challenges, so we really dont want only to build a butler or sorter but to build a strong product engine so that every three years we take an industry and disrupt it. Thats where we want to reach before we do any IPO.So the next 12-18 months are going to be all about global expansion and reducing our warehousing cost to the lowest possible and adding more products to our portfolio, so that we have a range of products. On the software side, we are building a platform that can run a warehouse end-to-end.",2016-09-26,0W6HaSp2RRPe1CYw3fkxXM,"Akash Gupta, co-founder and chief technology officer at GreyOrange, speaks about the journey of GreyOrange and its future plans

				The centre will also house the companys largest information technology organization outside of the companys global headquarters. Mint had in October 2015 first reported about Fords plans to set up a global technology and business centre in India.India is not only a vibrant market for cars and new mobility ideas, it also is rich with talent, technical expertise and ingenuity, executive chairman Bill Ford said in a statement. This new center will help us attract the best and brightest, and make Chennai a true hub of innovation for Ford around the world. Once it gets completed in 2019, the centre will become Fords third global product development centre in Asia Pacific and part of Fords global product development network.It also will feature a wide range of laboratories and testing facilities for both full vehicles and components, enabling Ford to conduct extensive testing of future vehicles in India, the company said in a statement. However, Tuesdays announcement is unlikely to help Fords India operations immediately and the focus will be more on feeding into the Detroit-based companys global operations.Ford in India continues to struggle even after being present in the country for more than 20 years, in which the Indian market has changed drastically.In the six years between 2010-11 and 2015-16, the American car makers annual sales in India have grown only twice. Sales reached the highest at 98,537 units in 2010-11 because of the success of the Figo but they declined to 92,665 units and 77,225 units in 2011-12 and 2012-13, respectively. Sales grew in 2013-14 and fell in 2014-15 only to rise again in 2015-16, albeit on a smaller base. During the same period, the Indian passenger vehicle market expanded from 2.52 million units to 2.78 million.In recent times, the companys second generation Figo failed to receive the kind of response that the previous one did. Ford did create a new compact SUV segment with the EcoSport, but it failed to capitalize on the first-mover advantage. The segment is now dominated by market leader Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Hyundai Motor India Ltd. Ford, along with Volkswagen India Pvt. Ltd, was the last one to enter the sub-four-metre sedan category but demand in the segment has waned, which meant lukewarm response for the American car makers Figo Aspire.In pursuit of making its business sustainable, the company has changed tack and shifted focus to exports, which grew 41.37% to 55,821 units between April and September.Indias overall car exports grew 3.89% to 319,579 units.In the new centre in Chennai, the company will hire 3,000 skilled workers over the next five years. Ford also will consolidate 9,000 employees from six existing facilities in Chennai on the 28-acre campus, the company said in a statement.Ford has invested over $2 billion in India to set up two plants, one each in Chennai and Sanand in Gujarat.

During this time, the S&P BSE Sensex index has fallen 0.8%.Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds long-awaited commercial launch has reduced the prolonged period of uncertainty that surrounded this venture. While it was clear that RIL was betting big on the telecom sector, there was no clarity on the launch date or  pricing strategy. Both questions have now been answered, and some analysts are excited about the companys prospects of gaining reasonable market share.To be sure, Jios success cant be taken for granted, especially as far as returns from the venture go. In a recent interview, RILs chairman Mukesh Ambani suggested that Jio was targeting a return of 18-19% on capital. That wont be easy to achieve. Analysts from Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd indicate that achieving that would require revenues that are close to market leader Bharti Airtel Ltds; and a similar Arpu (average revenue per user) profile as the top three companies in the sector (around Rs210) at Bharti Airtels subscriber base (250 million). We believe such returns can be difficult to achieve in the first four years, they wrote  in a note to clients on 19 September.But Jio isnt the only reason for the renewed excitement around RIL shares. Benchmark Singapore complex gross refining margins (GRMs) have surged this month. GRM is a measure of profitability for refining firms. According to an analyst, Singapore GRM, the difference between the per barrel price of crude oil and the value of products distilled from it, touched $7 a barrel on Friday. In the June quarter, average GRM was at $5 a barrel. RILs refining business contributed as much as 68% of the companys stand-alone earnings before interest and tax in the June quarter. Additionally, RIL is also expected to benefit from higher light-heavy and lower Brent-Dubai spreads.Besides, analysts expect it to generate high free cash flow (FCF) from 2017-18. RIL is coming out of its capex phase, which in our view will pave the way for a multiyear cycle of strong FCF generation averaging $5 billion per annum over F1Y8-20, implying >11% FCF yield, wrote analysts from Morgan Stanley Research in a report on 25 September. RIL will benefit from the start of earnings delivery from downstream, which we expect to add ~$3.2 billion in Ebitda by FY18, assuming oil prices remain low at $50 a barrel. Ebitda, or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, is an indicator of operating profitability.But note that despite the recent outperformance, investors have lost out considerably from a long-term perspective.

0.03,"Beijing: Its goodbye China, hello virtual reality (VR) for Hugo Barra. After spending three and half years in Beijing leading smartphone-maker Xiaomi Corp.s global division, Barra is returning to Silicon Valley to head Facebooks VR efforts. 
				   
				He leaves behind an uneven legacy.Barra, 40, was hired in 2013 from Google, where he worked as head of product management for Android, to oversee Xiaomis international expansion. While he helped boost device sales in India, the company aborted a push into Brazil and its other global efforts have largely stalled. At the same time, Xiaomi lost ground in its home market to domestic competitors like Vivo and Oppo, which worked more effectively with retail stores. Barra arrived with an ambitious vision, but failed to predict and overcome rapid changes in the global smartphone market.He did a lot to build up Xiaomis mindshare internationally, said Bryan Ma, vice president for devices research at IDC in Singapore. But when you look at the hard numbers, they show mixed results.Barras surprise exit comes just a couple of weeks after co-founder and CEO Lei Jun said in a letter to employees that the company had recently faced unforgettable challenges and now needed to focus on sustainable growth. After building its success by selling only online, its now developing brick-and-mortar stores in China. Barra declined to comment for this story, but he cited several accomplishments in social media posts as he departed, including the expansion into India and more than 20 other markets. A spokesperson for Xiaomi said Thursday he would continue to advise the company for the indefinite future.When he first moved from sunny California to smoggy Beijing, Barra brought the world spotlight with him. Energetic, globe-trotting, and supremely comfortable commanding a conference-hall stage, the Brazilian-born Barra showed Xiaomi how to introduce its expanding line of products -- which include fitness bands, ear buds, and air filters -- into other countries with a fast-growing middle class.He helped to be that ambassador to the rest of the world, said IDCs Ma. He was that enthusiastic, charismatic guy on stage, who helped explain who this Chinese company was.From 2012 to 2015, Xiaomis smartphone sales rose at a furious clip, expanding more than six-fold, powered by online flash sales and savvy social-media. For parts of 2014 and 2015, Xiaomi ranked first in domestic smartphone sales, and local and international media dubbed the company the Apple of China. When Barra joined, he hoped to translate that success abroad, identifying India and Brazil as key targets. The vision was promising enough that in late 2014, Xiaomi was valued at about $45 billion, the highest for any startup in the world at the time.Yet Xiaomis position at home soon began slipping. Facing intense competition from Vivo, Oppo and other rivals, Xiaomi dropped from first to fourth among smartphone sellers in China. While it focused on online sales, its competitors worked to become more prominent in retail stores, where the vast majority of customers still buy phones. The challenges at home foreshadowed hurdles in other markets.To replicate an e-commerce model from China in India or Indonesia is not as easy as it sounds. Every country has a different internet culture, said Edward Tse, a Hong Kong-based business consultant and author of the book Chinas Disruptors, which described the early days of Xiaomi and other Chinese tech upstarts.By traveling frequently to India -- and chronicling his trips on social media -- Barra helped to build a smartphone business there with $1 billion in annual revenue, an achievement he noted in his farewell Facebook post. Xiaomi is currently ranked third in the Indian smartphone market, with 9 percent market share, according to Counterpoint Research.Hugo spearheaded the idea of how you bring Xiaomi-branded products outside of China, said Gary Rieschel, founding managing partner at Qiming Venture Partners, an early investor in Xiaomi. He works incredibly hard.Barra thanked Lei Jun and Xiaomis fans in his departure post on Facebook. This journey has been nothing short of spectacular in every way, he wrote, and I can proudly say that Xiaomi Global is the first baby I helped bring into the world.Neil Shah, Counterpoints research director in India, thinks Xiaomis performance in India may be near peaking. Theres almost a ceiling about how much you can sell online. Sixty to seventy percent of the markets are offline, he said. For online channels, Xiaomis margins are razor thin, in India and China alike. Chinese rival Vivo, which works closely with retail stores, has already overtaken Xiaomi in India.IDCs Ma says Xiaomis prospects in India look positive for the next year, but after that he isnt so sure. The story in India reflects a lot of what has been happening in China, too. As the market shifts toward offline channels, it favors Oppo and Vivo.According to IDC, India is now Xiaomis dominant overseas market -- accounting for 62 percent of its non-China shipments for the first nine months of 2016. Next up is Myanmar, accounting for 16 percent of shipments. Myanmar is not exactly the first country that comes to mind when you think of the global smartphone market, said Ma.After opening with much fanfare in the summer of 2015, Xiaomis Brazil office closed last year. The companys position in Brazilian smartphone sales peaked in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, with about 1% of the market, according to Tina Lu, head of Counterpoint Research for Latin America. Everything they were selling, they were selling at a loss, she said. Unless you assemble devices locally, you face taxes of about 60 percent. Xiaomi explored, but never finalized, plans to manufacture devices in Brazil.A former employee at Xiaomis Brazil office, which once employed 23 people, said local management struggled to distinguish itself. Beyond the pricing and brand challenges, the outpost had a difficult time coordinating strategy with Beijing, the person said.Replicating Xiaomis early success in developing economies turned out to be elusive -- with obstacles ranging from Brazils heavy taxes on foreign-assembled devices; to patent-infringement lawsuits in India; to the slow adoption of e-commerce in most developing countries compared with China.A lot of people, including myself, once thought that if a Chinese technology company can make it there in China, it can make it anywhere. But I got that wrong, said Clay Shirky, an associate professor at NYU Shanghai and author of the 2015 book on Xiaomi, Little Rice: Smartphones, Xiaomi, and the Chinese Dream.Now Xiaomi will turn greater attention to fighting for its home turf. In his recent letter to employers, Lei Jun admitted the company had lost focus as it attempted rapid expansion, into both new products and countries. Thats why we must slow our pace, and seriously learn from our mistakes, he wrote.Barra isnt the only executive departing amid the slowdown. In October, Chen Tong, a vice-president for content at Xiaomi, left the company to join news platform Yidianzixun. Zhang Jinling, a vice-president managing finance and investments, left to join Baidu Inc. Chen did not respond to a request for comment, and Zhang declined to comment.They had some glory days in the past. One can never count them out, said Tse. But for them to really come back, they need to do a lot of hard work to rebuild the brand. People in China view it now as a declining brand. Bloomberg",2017-01-27,1b62RMQZOeDcrsfVN26CTN,"Hugo Barra had joined Xiaomi with an ambitious vision, but failed to predict and overcome rapid changes in the global smartphone market.",18:46,"Hugo Barra, in shift to Facebook, leaves behind unfinished expansion at Xiaomi"
0.01,"The Companies Act 2013 requires large (above a specified threshold level) firms to spend 2% of their net profits on corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects. This law came into effect in April 2014. The results on CSR expenditures by firms in the fiscal year 2015-16 were released recently. It is certainly true that Indian firms collectively are more than complying with the CSR law. According to Prime Database, Indian companies spent Rs9,309 crore on CSR projects in 2015-16, which was Rs163 crore more than the amount required by law, and Rs703 crore more than the previous year.
				   
				The general reaction in the Indian press has been positive and suggests that the CSR law has been a success. However, the CSR law is only apparently successful, and in reality is harmful.The problem is that reported expenditure on CSR projects is not a good metric of societal welfare. These numbers overstate the effect of the law. It is not clear whether firms have really increased their CSR spending after the law compared to what they were spending voluntarily before the law, because CSR spending was not well reported historically. There is some evidence that while firms that were initially spending less than 2% increased their CSR activity, but those that were initially spending more than 2% reduced their CSR expenditure. Another possibility is that firms spent money on CSR activities that also lead to increasing firm profits, such as inculcating goodwill and good public relations. There is evidence indicating CSR spending leads to brand building and employee engagement. In that case, firms would have carried out these activities with or without the law. Even if we take the CSR expenditure at face value and assume these are valid numbers, there are still major problems with the CSR law. A required expenditure that does not lead to higher profits is essentially a tax. The CSR law can be viewed as a 2% tax, albeit spent by the firms rather than given to the government. This is a back-door way to increase corporate taxes without a transparent political debate. The corporate tax rate in India is 34.61%already one of the highest, compared to a global average of 24.09%, according to KPMG, an audit and consulting company. Given the emphasis on liberalization and economic growth, it is unlikely that the Indian polity desires an increase in the corporate tax rate. This certainly will not help to make Indian firms more globally competitive nor attract more foreign investment into India.Even to the extent that there has been a real increase in socially beneficial activities, the spending has not gone to democratically determined priorities, but rather to whatever the companies prefer to emphasize. Of the nine different schedules prescribed by The Companies Act, two schedules: combating various diseases and promotion of education accounted for 44% of the total CSR expenditure, while reducing child mortality received no funding and eradicating extreme hunger and poverty received only 6% of the total CSR expenditure. Given that about 50% of children in India are malnourished due to pervasive poverty, it is unlikely that the above allocation of resources reflects the democratic will of the Indian people. It is the governments responsibility to determine high-priority needs of society and target public expenditure in these areas. With the CSR law, the government has abdicated one of its primary functions.There is also an issue of geographic equity. Five states: Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu account for well over one-quarter of all CSR spending. Towards the bottom of the list are Nagaland, Mizoram, Tripura, Sikkim and Meghalayaall from the NorthEast. This, of course, reflects the inclinations, interests, and priorities of the business sector. But, it is the responsibility of the government to help achieve a more egalitarian society.CSR is a controversial idea with many executives, academics and officials on both sides of the issue. Thus, it is not surprising that the Indian law does not clearly define CSR for the purposes of expenditures. The law lists only a few genres of CSR activities: eradicating extreme hunger and poverty, promotion of education, and social business projects. This is much too vague to work as a legal definition. It is not surprising that the law does not even discuss, let alone define, an enforcement mechanism or penalties for non-compliance.The CSR law is inherently contradictory. CSR is fundamentally an inspirational exercise, and it is very difficult to legislate aspirations. Laws only set minimum standards, but do not create an impetus for positive action. For example, it would be difficult to require that companies build excellent schools; the legal requirement can be met merely by spending money on education.Inequality in India, which was already high, has increased even more. The CSR law does not go far enough in reducing inequality and helping the disadvantaged. Without a coercive enforcement mechanism, it is unlikely that the law will result in widespread compliance and real effectiveness. In other words, required CSR will remain largely voluntary, but give the illusion of progress. This is greenwashing on a national scale!India is the first country to require companies to expend resources on CSR. There is sound logic behind why other countries have not done this, and India should not either.

-0.07,"Davos: Open markets and global trade have been blamed for job losses over the last decade, but global chief executive officers say the real culprits are increasingly machines.
				   
				And while business leaders gathered at the annual World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos relish the productivity gains technology can bring, they warned this week that the collateral damage to jobs needs to be addressed more seriously.From taxi drivers to healthcare professionals, technologies such as robotics, driverless cars, artificial intelligence and 3-D printing mean more and more types of jobs are at risk. Adidas, for example, aims to use 3-D printing in the manufacture of some running shoes.Jobs will be lost, jobs will evolve and this revolution is going to be ageless, its going to be classless and its going to affect everyone, said Meg Whitman, chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise.So while some supporters of Donald Trump and Brexit may hope new government policies will bring lost jobs back to Americas Rust Belt or Britains industrial north, economists estimate 86% of US manufacturing job losses are actually down to productivity, according to the WEFs annual risks report.Technology is the big issue and we dont acknowledge that, Mark Weinberger, chairman of consultancy EY, said on Thursday, arguing there was a tendency to always blame trading partners.The political backdrop is prompting CEOs to take more seriously the challenge of long-life training of workforces to keep up with the exponential growth of technological advances. I think what were reaching now is a time when we may have to find alternative careers through our lifetime, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella told Reuters. Over the last decade, more jobs have been lost to technology than any other factor, and John Drzik, head of global risk at insurance broker Marsh, expects more of the same. That is going to raise challenges, particularly given the political context, Drzik, who helped compile the WEF report, said.Compared to clamping down on immigration by tightening borders, dealing with the impact of technology destroying jobs is something that is perhaps even less easily controlled.For while many advanced technologies remain more expensive than low- or medium-skilled labour in the near term, the shift is likely to accelerate as costs come down.Widening gapTechnological advancements require governments, businesses and academic institutions to develop more educated and highly skilled workforces, executives in Davos said.But this shift to skilled workers also widens the income gap and fuels growing inequality.Jonas Prising, CEO of staffing firm ManpowerGroup, noted that US unemployment is only about 2 to 2.5% among college-educated people but 9 or 10 percent among those with low or no skills.The idea that we would ban automation as part of an evolution within the manufacturing industry, is not really part of the discussion, Prising said. He pointed to policies in countries like Denmark and Italy, where there is a focus on employability of workers.If we dont own responsibility (for the problem of displaced workers), its only going to get bigger, Procter & Gamble Chief Executive David Taylor said.Brawn and brainThe scope of the employment risk from what the WEF calls the fourth industrial revolution which blurs the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres is unclear.A University of Oxford study in 2013 said nearly half of US jobs were at risk, while in 2015 Forrester Research predicted a net loss of only 7% by 2025, as some lost jobs will be replaced with new ones. Forrester predicts that by 2019, one-quarter of all job tasks will be offloaded to software robots, physical robots, or customer self-service automation. Even the corner office may not be safe. CEOs feel reasonably confident we are not going to be replaced by artificial intelligence, Inga Beale, CEO of the Lloyds of London insurance market, said. But Im sure there will be a time! Reuters",2017-01-20,22gKFsmn9CELtWF1yh2pNO,"Technological advancements require govts, businesses and academic institutions to develop more educated and highly skilled workforces, say executives at Davos ",12:36,Impact of job-stealing robots a growing concern among global CEOs at Davos
1.0,"Bengaluru: Abidali Neemuchwala completes a year on 1 February as Wipro Ltds chief executive officer (CEO). The former Tata Consultancy Services Ltd veteran, who joined Wipro as chief operating officer (COO) in April 2015, remains confident that by the end of March 2018, Wipro will be able to come back to industry-matching growth.
ALSO READ | Wipro revenue forecast underlines IT industrys challengesOver his 20 months at Wipro, Neemuchwala, who is based in Dallas, has focused on simplifying internal processes, worked on organization alignment to improve execution, embraced hyper automation and adopted an aggressive mergers and acquisitions approach. The measures have helped Wipro marginally improve upon the 3.7% dollar revenue growth recorded in 2015-16, which is  expected to grow at-best 5% in the year ending March. Edited excerpts from an interview:Three full quarters as CEO, and you have embarked on a journey by articulating six broad themes. Given these measures you have started, the management has said in the past that a complete turnaround will take time. Will it be fair to ask if the company can come back or say end March 2018 with industry-matching growth or Nasscom-projected growth numbers? How would you describe this quarter?Operationally, it was a good quarter. Our profitability improved in a quarter where there are furloughs and fewer working days. But I think in revenue growth we could have done more. But core business is doing well. India and Middle East business restructuring (had an impact) and Appirio (acquisition) closing also took time. So these things aside, Im very confident that Wipro is progressing well and I believe three-four quarters is a reasonable time frame (when we will come back to Industry-leading growth). You need all cylinders to be firing for industry-leading growth and that is what Im focusing on. One criticism of your 20-month stint, first as COO and then the 10 months as CEO, is that you have shied away from taking tough decisions when it comes to making or appointing leaders. Analysts believe you have continued with the same set of leaders. One of the things which is part of my nature is that we dont advertise tough decisions. As a CEO, you take tough decisions all the time. About 40% of my current leadership team, from direct reporting structure, is not what I inherited from T.K. Kurien. We have new leadership where ever it is required. (What) Im also very sensitive about is that whenever these changes happen, we do it very respectfully and consciously. So we dont make changes for the heck of making changes. In fact, I feel very good that if you as a journalist dont see this change, then customers also dont see this change. And this is the best thing for us. Remember, we have had a very smooth CEO transition, or rather the smoothest in the industry. Do you think there is a lot of noise on visa regulation in the US and Indian companies dependence on visas is actually coming down?Absolutely. The industry, including Wipro, has learnt to hire globally, many more local employees. Rebadged a lot of employees from our customers. Today I guide my hiring managers that dont make overseas job posting as an attraction. That era is over. So today I tell young talent that if you want to do great digital and path breaking and domain focused work, join Wipro. So dependence on visa has absolutely come down over the last few years. And so it is not that much of a worry because we believe that all business friendly decisions will be taken by the US government. What are say two challenges ahead of you, as you start calendar year 2017?Strategically, we have to future-proof our organization. So execution here will be key. Our exposure to telecoms and energy in the past had its impact. So balancing the whole portfolio takes time. We have to configure our business that we are diversified enough so that cyclical changes do not have more than impact.Now India and Middle East is creating new opportunities. Historically, we have had challenges. So we plan to complete in two quarters. So we hope to complete by Q1 of next financial year. All this is apart from continuing to make our mergers integrate well and continuing with our six-pillar strategy.",2017-01-26,2Jb7ZhgprpY3XgjU6wibJN,"Wipro CEO Abidali Neemuchwala says operationally, the December quarter was  good for the firm but revenue growth could have been better",01:08,Wipro will be back to industry-matching growth in 3-4 quarters: CEO Abidali Neemuchwala
0.07,"An investment recovery and the health of the banking system are inextricably linked. The banking industry needs cash. Bloated with bad loans, state-owned banks require Rs.1 trillion in the near term, estimate brokerage firms and rating agencies. The government, on the other hand, has allotted only Rs.25,000 crore for this year under its so-called Indradhanush programme.
				   
				Consider this statistic: In the December quarter alone, banks posted a cumulative loss of Rs.10,911 crore, which is slightly over two-fifths of governments proposed capital infusion. Credit Suisse estimates that unprovided problem loans are now at 65-200% of public sector banks capital.The capital requirement will grow further as most banks are yet to recognize some more bad loans. The chart shows how badly banks need capital. Overall, estimated capital requirement for the banking system is between Rs.2.5 trillion and Rs.3 trillion over the next four years compared with the governments promise of Rs.70,000 crore.Clearly, given its fiscal constraints the government may not be able to cough up any huge amount upfront, especially after the Seventh Pay Commission and 14th Finance Commission recommendations. The solution to the bad loan problem, which will free up cash for banks and enable them to accumulate it out of profits, lies in policy measures.A comprehensive bankruptcy code was promised in the last budget; it is in the works and yet to become law. Another idea that has taken hold in recent times is the creation of a bad bank, some version of the USs Troubled Asset Relief Programme after the 2008 crisis. This would be a sovereign-backed asset reconstruction company. But that doesnt save taxpayers from taking a hit as someone would have to make good those losses. It also creates a moral hazard as banks arent made liable for their past bad decisions.Of course, the government can reduce its stake below 51% in public sector banks. It can always bring down its stake to 33% while still keeping voting rights intact. The big concern here is cheap valuations currently and hurdles from bank unions and accusations of selling the family silver.

But other income rose by a third from a year ago to Rs3,025 crore, boosting profit growth to a good extent.
				   
				In fact, the refining business was expected to perform well thanks to a better refining operating environment, as the Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) had improved sequentially. Sure, the companys GRM improved to $10.8 a barrel from $10.1 a barrel in the September quarter but fell short of the expectations of many analysts. For instance, Kotak Institutional Equities and Nomura Research were expecting the measure at $11.3 a barrel and $11.5 a barrel, respectively. RILs premium over benchmark Singapore GRM at $4.1 per barrel is also the lowest in the past three quarters.Even as the petrochemicals business performed well with its Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) increasing 30% from a year earlier, the fact that RILs key business segment hasnt performed as expected is disappointing. Refining business Ebit accounted for almost two-thirds of the companys total Ebit in the quarter. The domestic oil and gas business posted a loss at the Ebit level, due to lower price realizations and lower volumes. The organized retail business has performed well but the segment is relatively small to have a meaningful overall impact.What of the stock? The RIL stock has underperformed the benchmark Sensex index so far this fiscal year. But its worth noting that the share price has appreciated about 16% from its closing low of Rs930 seen on 23 May 2016. Currently, one RIL share trades at 11 times estimated earnings for the next fiscal year. The refining environment continues to remain strong but is already known to investors and may not be enough to override their other concerns.RILs outstanding debt has increased to Rs1,94,381 crore as on 31 December from Rs1,89,132 crore as on 30 September. During the same time frame, cash and cash equivalents declined to Rs76,339 crore from Rs82,533 crore. That could be a concern, according to independent analyst S.P. Tulsian, who said, I believe this is mostly on account of increase in telecom capex, a business from which there is no clarity on revenue or Ebitda from a near-term perspective. The market is not going to react positively due to concerns on negative cash flows and unimpressive profit growth of refining, its core and main business segment, says Tulsian. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.Of course, all eyes will be on the performance of the telecom business. The company has recently expressed confidence saying that it will prove the financial communitys scepticism wrong with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds performance. The year 2017 will see a test of this optimism as Jio turns into a paid service, said CLSA in a report on 2 January.This year will also see stabilization of RILs downstream projects. Analyst expectations of incremental Ebitda from these projects remain markedly below guidance of $3bn-3.5bn, points out CLSA. The low expectations give room for surprise to the upside, added the report. The stock thus is likely to take cues from a combination of telecom and downstream projects news flow, which is where investor attention will also be focused in fiscal year 2018.",2017-01-17,343YGLUtdxSMgy0SZVbXEM,Reliance Industriess GRM improved to $10.8 a barrel from $10.1 a barrel in the September quarter but fell short of the expectations of many analysts,00:36,RILs refining business fails to wow in Q3
0.41,"Vodafone India Ltds June quarter results suggest competitive pressures eased in the voice segment for the mobile services industry; although the data segment continues to struggle for growth.The company said last week, Voice revenues returned to growth as competition eased, although the 2.2% year-on-year growth in June is nothing to get too excited about. Revenues were flat in the March quarter.Data revenue grew by 22%, year-on-year (y-o-y), down from 35% in the March quarter and as high as 65% just a year ago. Nevertheless, its heartening to note that the company has taken some steps to spur growth. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, data volume grew by 6.5%, up from a mere 0.7% growth in the March quarter.In the fourth quarter of the last fiscal, some companies such as Idea Cellular Ltd and Vodafone had reduced promotions in the market, which had resulted in slightly better price realizations, but had hit growth. There seems to have been a reversal in strategy in the June quarter. Its likely ldea, too, may report a bounceback in data growth sequentially.Of course, the key is for this growth to sustain. As things stand, the incumbents in the sector seem to be content upgrading existing users to 3G and 4G services. The total number of data users has more or less stagnated at Vodafone India. They have grown by only 4% in the past one year. The only reason data volume is growing at a faster pace is that a much larger proportion of users have shifted to 3G/4G services, where consumption is about three-to-four times higher, compared with 2G data services (see chart). Of course, theres a limit to how much the data segment can grow with this strategy.This month, Bharti Airtel Ltd, Idea and Vodafone increased data benefits in an attempt to get subscribers to increase usage. But such a strategy is unlikely to provide a breakthrough in attracting new data customers.As such, it seems like it will only be after Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds launch that data prices will crash meaningfully enough to attract new users. Until then, the incumbents seem content to coast along as far as volumes and revenues go. Its important to note that despite sluggish volumes and a drop in price realizations, they have managed to maintain (in some cases, even improve) profit margins and generate large amounts of cash. Vodafone Indias profit margins stood at 28% two years ago, and are at over 29% now. Avoiding a mad rush for volume growth looks like a sane choice after all.",2016-07-25,3yLNXVt9kLeUIx2XURqvJJ,"It seems like it will only be after Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds launch that data prices will crash meaningfully enough to attract new users

Recently they were also in talks to raise primary capital with Partners Group, but those talks havent reached any conclusion and now they have engaged in discussions with Brookfield, the second person added.In June 2015, SunEdison had announced that it would acquire Continuums assets. In September, however, the deal was scrapped owing to SunEdisons financial problems.

				The Singapore complex gross refining margin (GRM), a measure of the difference between the per-barrel price of crude and the value of products distilled from it, dropped to $5 a barrel in the June quarter, compared with $7.7 a barrel in the March quarter. Still, the reported GRMs of Indian refining firms on a sequential basis fared better. However, these GRMs got a boost on account of inventory gains, thanks to the rising oil price trend over the quarter.Adjusted for refining inventory gains, the GRMs of oil marketing companies (OMCs) were in the range of $4-5 a barrel, according to Spark Capital Advisors (India) Pvt. Ltd. OMCs include Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC). OMCs results beat Street expectations. IOCs operating profit increased by one-third, compared with last years June quarter. HPCLs operating profit rose 17% year-on-year, while BPCLs operating profit increased at a much slower pace of 3%.GRM is a measure of profitability.Reliance Industries Ltds (RIL) reported premium of $6.5 per barrel over Singapore GRM was the highest in the past eight years, according to the firm, and exceeded Street estimates by a good margin. Most analysts expected RILs GRM to be $9.5-10 per barrel. But RILs GRM came in at $11.5 per barrel. The management indicated $2 per barrel can be attributed to gains from inventory, hedging and risk management. RILs stand-alone revenue fell 19%, reflecting the decline in the broader crude oil prices, while net profit rose about 19%. That was because of a 628 basis points jump in operating profit margin, a 3% decline in depreciation cost and an 18.5% rise in other income. A basis point is 0.01%.Meanwhile, oil producers have had it tough what with oil prices languishing.

0.24,"Amid all manner of disclosures, some quite unsavoury, in the Cyrus Mistry vs. Ratan Tata battle, the one silver lining has been how neither camp has accused the other of personal excesses. So while Mistry has suggested the groups pursuit of a small car for the Indian middle class was no more than a personal fancy of Tata and should be wound up, the accusation never extended to how the man who ran the group for over 20 years went and splurged on a gold plated Rolls Royce for himself. 
				   
				Indeed, till the time Tata Motors Ltd bought Jaguar Land Rover, the group owner would often squeeze himself into one of the more plebian cars the company made.In truth, most of Indias company owners and founders have conservative lifestyles with few of the wild and exotic indulgences that we associate with the billionaire lifestyle across the world. Sample this: in January 2014, the Dallas Safari Club, a hunters rights organization, auctioned off a permit which would allow the holder to travel to Namibia for the chance to kill one of only 5,000 surviving black rhinos. The auction was won by oil heir and Texas hunter Corey Knowlton, who bid $350,000 for that dubious right.It isnt the kind of thing that Tata or Kumar Mangalam Birla or Mukesh Ambani, or a dozen other Indian tycoons are likely to be doing on their summer breaks. Despite their obvious wealth, their sensibilities seem no different from that of many well-brought-up middle-class Indians of an earlier era. That shows even in the way most behave with people around them. Thus, Tata will often hold the elevator door open at Bombay House when he sees an executive rushing towards it and by all accounts Mistry is a chip off the same block.Dilip Shanghvi, founder of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and the countrys richest billionaire by some rankings, is low-key to a fault. Fortis Healthcare Ltd co-founders Malvinder and Shivinder Singh may be in the best-dressed lists of social magazines, but you are unlikely to find Prathap Reddy, founder of Apollo Hospitals or Y.K. Hamied, chairman of Cipla Ltd, displaying any sartorial vanities.Most of them dress simply, wearing suits only for meetings and even those tend to be the kind that will hardly attract attention. Tata, in fact, seems to have dropped his jacket of late, appearing in his shirt sleeves at most of the acrimonious annual general meetings of his group companies over the last few months. Clearly they are not following the example of UK-based billionaire Scott Alexander, dubbed the Vainest Man in Britain, who likes to buy out entire clothes collections, rather than just certain pieces. One year he spent £300,000 on clothes from Dolce & Gabbana.At meetings to discuss strategic plans for his group, Ajay Piramal munches on such frugal fare as khakra while Reliance Industries Ltd chairman Mukesh Ambanis fondness for vada paav is legendary. Contrast their gastronomical conservatism with that of Sean Parker, co-founder of Napster, who is known to have spent $13,000 on a single meal.Indias IT billionaires are of course in a class of their own in terms of frugality. Azim Premji, once Indias richest man, whose stake in Wipro Ltd. is worth nearly $15 billion, would often take an auto rickshaw from the old airport in Bengaluru and once threw a mini fit when he was automatically upgraded from his regular economy class seat on a Kingfisher flight to Delhi.The others, Infosys founders N.R. Narayana Murthy, Nandan Nilekani and the reclusive Shiv Nadar who set up HCL Technologies Ltd, are no different. The latters one indulgence is his Zen garden, on which he showers attentions. How utterly boring, when compared to Australian billionaire Clive Palmer, who got himself a $600 million replica of the Titanic, or another billionaire who recently ordered a diamond and gold encrusted collar for his pet dog.Of course, Indias billionaire class has its honourable exceptions and the latest gizmo or car eventually does find its way to Indian shores.

				As the sun set, Musk told hundreds of guests gathered outside that Tesla and SolarCity Corp., the company that he chairs and which he aims to acquire, will make solar roofs that look better than normal roofs. He then showcased several houses with different roofing styles and said they were all solar, with solar panels embedded into glass shingles.How do we have a solar roof that is better than a normal roof, looks better, last longer, said Musk. You want to pull your neighbours over and say Check out this sweet roof.Musks presentation was short on details about the efficiency of the solar roofs, their warranty, cost or when they will be available. The solar roof is offered in four styles: Textured Glass Tile, Slate Glass Tile, Tuscan Glass Tile, and Smooth Glass Tile  due to a variety of architectural styles.Home batteriesThe idea is that homeowners will generate electricity for their home with solar power, then store that electricity in a home battery known as a Powerwall. You can fill up your battery during the day, then discharge it at night when the sun sets.Musk and Tesla chief technology officer JB Straubel have long envisioned a clean-energy future of electric cars powered by an increasingly solar grid, with Teslas batteries optimizing both.

-0.55,"Singapore: This weeks putsch at Tata Sons has already served one useful purpose. While its been clear for a while that something wasnt quite right at the $100 billion Indian empire, the chairmans surprise ouster has made it possible to start asking questions about strategy (or lack of it) at a conglomerate that traces its roots to the American civil war.
				   
				Did the newly dumped Cyrus Mistry fail to plant enough saplings of growth? Or did Ratan Tata, who gave Mistry the job only to take it back four years later, not want to face reality? Are some of the businesses he acquired now covered in weeds, compelling Mistry to trim the outgrowth of debt?The answers will be important for investors in the groups publicly traded units, who, at present, have no idea how the coup at the holding company will affect them.Letting Tata vs. Mistry play out in public is a delicious idea. With the Economic Times leaking the contents of an unhappy email purportedly written by Mistry to the Tata Sons board and owners, and at least one of those shareholders giving a TV interview on what they disliked about the Mistry regime, the slugfest has begun. Its time to pour a cup of (Tata-owned) Tetley tea, and settle down.Also Read: Tata Sons dividend payout steady for last decadeV.R. Mehta, a trustee at one of the philanthropic organizations that collectively own roughly two-thirds of Tata Sons, is right to argue that under Mistry, the dividends from group companies have become increasingly reliant on just two businesses  Jaguar Land Rover, one of Ratan Tatas most audacious acquisitions, and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., the software export unit.But to what extent is Mistry responsible? In the letter attributed to him by the Economic Times, the ousted chairman claimed that it was Ratan Tatas 2009 decision to buy a property in suburban Mumbai  in disuse since a 1993 bomb attack  that led to Indian Hotels Co.s entire net worth getting wiped out. The companys last big profit, of $115 million, was in 2008.Then again, a year after Ratan Tata bought Corus Group Plc in 2006, Tata Steel went on to earn an annual profit of almost $3 billion. A China-led global steel glut has turned that profit into a loss of $1 billion over the past four quarters, with Mistry warning in his letter of a potential $10 billion impairment of European steel assets.Tata Steels loss in past 4 quartersMistry cant shift all the blame to his predecessor. While Ratan Tatas non-JLR car investments have mostly flopped, Mistrys problem was not having enough big ideas of his own. He may not have been the one to sink the wireless telecom unit, but he did precious little to revive it. He could also have handled the ugly spat with NTT Docomo Inc., the partner in that business, a lot better.Also Read: Ratan Tata seeks to rally group firms after Cyrus Mistry ousterThe Tata Group has survived two world wars, nationalization of its prized airline by a socialist-minded government and other tribulations. But the damage to the groups reputation for fair dealing is probably Mistrys biggest failing as chairman.That failure has consequences. In Singapore, bond investors are scratching their heads over a dollar-denominated perpetual bond issue by Tata International Ltd. The debt of this thinly capitalized company will derive its value from implicit support by the Tata group. A few years ago, it would have been preposterous to suggest that the Tatas would stake their reputation to save $1.17 billion  the amount the group is seeking to avoid paying in the Docomo dispute. Its worrisome if investors are no longer sure whether the group will even back a $150 million to $200 million bond issue. A no-holds-barred airing of differences between Mistry and Ratan Tata may help reestablish just what it is that shareholders of Tata Sons want their group to stand for. That will be the cherry on the cake from this entertaining spectacle  to be washed down with that Tetley tea, of course.

0.5,"The December quarter was expected to be a tough one for Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd, as advertisers cut spending in response to demonetisation. 
				   
				That was expected to show in the companys performance in the quarter, which it did, but the big surprise was on the profitability front. Its Ebitda of Rs515.8 crore was much higher than the Streets estimates. For instance, Kotak Institutional Equities and Edelweiss Securities Ltd were expecting the Ebitda at Rs430 crore. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.ALSO READ | Zee Entertainments profit up 8.6% at Rs250.8 croreA decline in costs led to this improvement, as overall revenue growth was just 3.4% compared to a year ago. Other expenses,  and advertising and publicity expenses declined.Coming to the advertising performance, Zee Entertainments consolidated ad revenue, accounting for 58% of total revenue, rose 3.4% year-on-year for the December quarter. In comparison, it had increased 15.7% and 19%, respectively, in the September and June quarters.According to the company, advertising revenue growth during the first 40 days of the quarter, i.e. pre-demonetisation, was similar to the growth seen in the half year ended September. What offers some comfort is that Zee Entertainments December quarter ad revenue performance was better than some analysts expectations. For instance, Kotak and Edelweiss were expecting ad revenue growth of 2% and 1%, respectively.Subscription revenue, accounting for 36% of total revenue, increased 13.7%, helped by closure of content deals with a few large distribution platform operators during the quarter. Subscription revenue included some catch-up revenues for the previous quarters. After a good quarter, much depends on how advertising shapes up. According to Mihir Modi, chief finance and strategy officer at Zee Entertainment, while advertising growth is better than November and December, it hasnt gone back to pre-demonetisation days.For the next six-eight months, Modi expects telecom and auto sectors to give impetus to advertising growth. The push from the telecom sector will be driven by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd while automobile launches will boost auto sector growth.Zee Entertainments shares have outperformed the benchmark Sensex so far this fiscal year. But more recently, the stock has been hit by the demonetisation blow. From a closing high of Rs579 in early October, the stock has declined 14% till now. Currently, one share trades at 30 times estimated earnings for the next fiscal year. The question investors will be grappling with is if the March quarter will see advertising revenue return to pre-demonetisation levels.

				Rami Rahim, an M.Sc. in electrical engineering from Stanford University and a Juniper veteran, has risen through the ranks to his current role of chief executive officer. In an interview, he talks about the changing digital landscape, the evolution of software-defined networking and the impact of cloud computing. Excerpts: Why did you feel the need to come up with another term, digital cohesion, when digital transformation already exists?The idea behind digital cohesion is to paint a vision of the future that people can relate to. When you talk about some of the advances in technology, in networking for example, while our partners, customers and stakeholders understand it inherently, but for a broader set of population, it is a bit difficult to relate to because they are not in this business. So digital cohesion paints an exciting vision of the future around technology and applications playing an interesting and important part in our day-to-day lives, of how these will come together to create truly life-enhancing experiences. And then to distil it down to a set of technology barriers that must be overcome in order for that vision to become a reality. Doing this makes the motivation to overcome those barriers really compelling.What will digital cohesion do that digital transformation wont?Digital transformation is typically around changes in business and technology, how these two come together to create new business opportunities through more agility and business efficiency. Digital cohesion is different: its coming together of applications and services to solve really interesting problems in the consumer and the business space. But both are important concepts.You have envisioned a world in which self-assembling apps will provide predictive, personalized services to people. Dont you think this will further increase the risk to personal privacy and data security? Right, this is one of the big barriers to this future in which the applications are always on in the background, as the mega cloud providers and service providers will need to collect a lot of information to be able to act on it. That can only happen when a lot of thought has been put into privacy policies and cyber security. As more and more applications are going to be connected, each of those connections presents an opening for the bad actors to come in and compromise the network and thus user data. We believe it will require a fundamentally different architectural approach to do what is necessary to improve the overall security posture of the network. What is the update on software-defined networking (SDN)?Any new technology or architecture goes through a hype cycle and SDN has gone through that cycle. About a year or so back, SDN was touted as the answer to most networking problems but that clearly is not the case. One should understand that software has always played a very important role in networking. In the past, our software and hardware systems were very tightly integrated but now they are loosely coupled and we are already offering software separately. Also, networking-as-a-service will add more value to the domain.At one point, Juniper was broad-basing its customer segment from telecom operators to other enterprises. But now with cloud coming up in a big way, most enterprises may not be buying networking gear at all. How is Juniper coping with this situation?The cloud is the single biggest trend that is impacting our industry and therefore our strategy today as a company. There are many types of companies in the cloud market, including the mega cloud companies, software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service players, co-location hosting providers and many others. This segment has been a very important part of our business and, over the past several years, revenue from these companies has double as a percentage of our total revenue. We are also helping telecom operators transform and grow their cloud, in addition to helping enterprises with a hybrid architecture in connecting their own data centres to the cloud. The approaching Internet of Things (IoT) world and your vision of digital cohesion will put a lot of strain on networks. What role will Juniper play here?I think IoT and 5G (fifth generation mobile technology) are both going to be cloud-native technologies. This means the services to the end consumers will be developed in a virtualized manner and delivered from a data centre. That is what we believe we are most suited forto provide the cloud infrastructure and solutions for data centres, wide area networks and the software that helps our customers in tapping into the cloud data centres with ease and agility.",2016-12-22,5a2p4CTEMC5oR85Il3Jx4J,"The cloud is the single biggest trend that is impacting our industry and therefore our strategy today as a company, says Juniper CEO Rami Rahim",00:58,Cloud is the biggest trend impacting networking industry: Juniper CEO
0.8,"Weather, access and traffic make India an ideal market for e-commerce.
				   
				Growing Internet access, largely through smartphones, and the increasing emphasis on cashless transactions make it a potentially lucrative market for e-commerce.The countrys sheer size and its population make it a potentially big market for e-commerce.Not surprisingly, Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal are battling it out for supremacy in this market, estimated to be worth $38 billion this year, according to industry lobby group Assocham. Still, success will be more a function of how these three deal with the regulatory and market conditions than how they do with each other.Indias policy regarding foreign investment in retail is fluid. On paper, the country allows foreign investment in supermarkets and department stores, although this policy was crafted by the earlier government and the current dispensation in New Delhi, while not keen to undo a reformist policy, has made it clear that it will not sign off on any applications. Its policy on e-commerce is just a little more complex. India allows 100% foreign direct investment in marketplaces, which provide a technology, payment and delivery platform that connects buyers and sellers. And it places curbs on the extent any one seller can dominate the marketplace, and on discounts.The regulatory regime is likely transient. India should, sooner than later, allow foreign investment in supermarkets and also in e-commerce sites that are hybrid models allowing direct retail and serving as a marketplace (Amazon follows this model in many countries, including the US). But until then, the challenge for Amazon, Flipkart, and Snapdeal is not to fall foul of it. The situation is exacerbated by traditional retailers who have taken both the legal and the lobbying route to prevent the march of the marketplaces. Some of this opposition comes from small so-called kirana or mom-and-pop stores. And some definitely comes from Indian Big Retail that would like some protection against deep-pocketed marketplaces. Indeed, a Nielsen report in 2015 showed that online retail in India is growing more at the expense of modern and organized retail than at the cost of kirana stores.Thats the first challenge. The second is to build a brand and, through that, brand loyalty. Through 2014 and 2015, the marketplaces have been big advertisers on TV and in print, proof that the ability of the digital medium to build brands is still suspect. Despite that, none has managed to build brand loyalty. In part, the marketplaces themselves are to blame.They have used their capital, including venture capital, to fund discountsto such an extent that many shoppers have been conditioned to expect significant discounts, sometimes in excess of 50%. To be sure, many have now gone slow on such sales, and will likely go slower, given the new government policy. The brand, and brand loyalty challenge remain.The third is to get the supply chain and customer service rightnot the easiest thing to do when millions of products are being sold to millions of customers across a few hundred cities and towns. Of the three marketplaces, only Amazon seems to have really focused on this, and the results are there for all to see. Still, its far too early to pick a winner.",2016-05-20,5sQ3isGn4ntbSC4SRPWV2I,"Success will be more a function of how Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal deal with the regulatory and market conditions than how they do with each other

1.0,"Bengaluru: A little over two decades back, K.R.Sridhar worked on a NASA mission to convert Martian atmospheric gases to oxygen for propulsion and life support. His work was so ahead of its time that Fortune magazine called him one of the top five futurists inventing tomorrow, today.
				   
				Fast forward to 2016, and the Indian-born rocket scientist-turned-entrepreneur is on a completely different mission: to provide clean, reliable energy for all on Earth.Sridhar, who founded Silicon Valley-based Bloom Energy that makes electricity from (solid oxide) fuel cells using natural gas, has finally brought the technology to India.In an interview with Mint, he talked about how it all started, the efficiency of green technology, why India needs it now more than ever and how it will navigate a few challenges unique to Asias third-largest economy. Edited excerpts:How did Bloom Energy come about?I started out trying to figure out how to create oxygen on Mars, and then along the way, to create water, breathing air, electricity and all those things so that you can think of a sustainable habitat. So I was working on that, but clearly American interest in space exploration started waning after the Cold War because we had other interests and other places to spend our money on. So I realized that seeing a human mission to Mars is not going to happen within the time frame, maybe not in my lifetime. So I started thinking of what I could do that could be impactful. I realized that water and energy are the biggest issues we are going to face in the next 100 years, given that we will get to 10 billion people on the planet. I also knew that if I had cleaner electricity, I could always provide clean water.What do you want to accomplish in India?India is a perfect place for us to prove our basic value proposition: which is you need to decentralize before you distribute it. India has proven that more than any other countryboth in computing and in telecom. If you think about supply of electricity and given when it is available, the extremely bad quality of that supply and the extreme environmental impact of that supply, we can take a page from computing and apply it to power and create distributed, sustainable power all over the country. It can become the model for the rest of the world to follow.Is it hard to sell your technology in a country like India?It is harder and easier. Its harder because until now the gas infrastructure did not exist and there wasnt a company like GAIL telling people, you buy this and we will provide the infrastructure for you and we will provide a reliable supply of gas for you. So it was hard. It is easier because in a place like the US, while they are hurling towards technology and are not afraid of new technology, the grid was fairly adequate and there was enough access to power and there wasnt a demand-supply mismatch. Whereas here, you are offering people power against not having power. So, its easier from that perspective. So it is both.There are many who think that a decentralised (generation and distribution) model will not work for gas-based technologies in India, but only in markets similar to the US. What are your thoughts?Natural gas will be the most abundantly available fuel in the 21st century for electric power generation around the world. This abundance will result in increasingly improved economics and an expanded global export market. Add the fact that natural gas is the lowest carbon fossil fuel and you have a very attractive fuel for power generation. This is the significance of our partnership with GAIL which is committed to expanding the natural gas infrastructure for decentralized power generation in India. With this, we believe that decentralised gas-fuelled power generation has a bright future in India and will help this country make the same kind of technology leapfrog in power generation from centralized to distributed that we have seen in telephonythe country avoided the fixed infrastructure investments of landline telephones and went straight to mobile.Your tariffs are still considerably above other alternate sources of power.The important question is what you are providing. Do they find the value in what you are doing. You may have a (cheaper) solar power plan, but with a solar panel on your roof, if you cannot turn on the lights in the night, when the sun is not shining, that power is not of much use to you. It doesnt matter what it costs.You may get a (cheaper) coal power plan because of which your child can study because the lights are on, but if that childs life is going to be reduced by 10 years because of all the pollution it puts up, you are going to wonder if that is the best alternative.A household may think, cheap power is good enough, why do I need more. The average life of all their appliances in their house is going down so fast because of problems with voltage and stability. They are never able to calculate the cost associated with that. They sometimes dont realize that they are paying significantly more for a refrigerator because the company had to build all these additional band-aids for that power, to make sure the warranty problem doesnt come to them and charge them more. It is about total overall value, as opposed to the essential value of commodities. That is an education that we have to do.We absolutely know that we have a learning curve and a cost curve. We are confident that over a few years with scale, people will use us not just because of all the positive attributes we bring, but also be cause we are the most affordable.How do you plan to procure biogas? Though GAIL has promised you natural gas, you will need more supply. So think of this1.3, fast forward 1.4 billion people in the nationthe amount of human waste, the amount of animal waste that comes from supporting this, the amount of plant waste that comes from supporting the animals and the plants is gigantic and it is either a liability or can be converted into an asset. And to us, it should be an asset and that becomes the biogas fuel. In the past, it was always a problem because the power plants were very, very large and you needed to go long distances to collect the biomass, bringing it to a huge centralized base and the cost of carrying it over a long distance was incredible.But, in the distributed Bloom model, people can take their own bio-waste and put that into their own bio-mass plant, generate their own biogas and produce their own power. And, in a true Gandhian way, can have a completely sustained solution.Are you happy with GAILs infrastructure in Bengaluru (where Bloom is powering technology company Intels R&D lab)?I dont think GAIL will say they are happy with it because they are aggressively trying to get into Bangalore, and as you know, in any big city like Bangalore, there are issues of being able to lay a pipeline quickly and all that. However, what I am extremely impressed with is the aggressive speed and passion with which they want to get it done, in spite of obstacles.What incentives are you offering to get more companies to sign up?You do that when you dont believe in your product. Our product more than speaks for itself. We are satisfying an unmet need. Those corporate customers have a root canal. I am offering them a pain killer. I dont need to discount it.But, if you look at the US, places where it worked were states where there were incentives or subsidies. Isnt it?True, there are different ways to look at it. If it were a level-playing field, we would require more subsidies. Because everyone else is subsidized. Not giving a subsidy to us puts us on an uneven playing field. That is the reason we need subsidies in the US.Could you eventually think of powering individual homes too?It may not be the best thing because if you think of individual homes, the evenings and mornings, when you do all these things, that (is when) you may be consuming power. It may be capital inefficient for you to have a piece of equipment that is not working for you all the time. It will better for a cluster of homes and businesses to be in a little micro-grid. I think thats a better solution than having a little box in every home.Where exactly will your fuel cell packs be installed?It should be right where you use it and where its under your control. Typically, you never did that because these power generators were noisy, they vibrated and so you liked to put it far awayout of sight, out of mind. Here is a beautiful looking piece of equipment, children can play around it, people can have a picnic table around it. You can put it on a rooftop, on a basement or next to a parking lot. For the same amount of energy that you can produce, we require 120 times less land. So, (while) land use is a big issue usually (with respect to  power generation), this is a non-issue for us.When are you going public?Going public is just a step of a long process for a company. It is not even the beginning to the end, its just one small step. When we are ready, we will do it. We are definitely closer to it than we were.People can think what they want. It is a private company and our stakeholdersour investors, customers and employeesare all happy with the path we have taken.Are you profitable?We can state with no uncertainty that if we dont find a path to make our own company sustainable, we cannot make the planet sustainable. We have a path for sustainability, both for us and our planet. Being a private company we dont discuss these things.Can you tell me about your energy capacity? Where do you see it in five years?We are very actively engaged in building a pipeline for customers. We have actively started engaging with prospective customers. Obviously in the regions where natural gas is available like Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad. Places like that where there is both an availability of natural gas and a supply-demand mismatch, where electricity is a problem. Hopefully, next year, when you see me, the numbers will be impressive.Could you possibly look at local manufacturing of fuel cells to bring costs down?We already manufacture some component systems in India and make use of supply chain partners which also contribute Make in India manufactured goods which are incorporated into our systems. As the market develops in India and volume justifies it, we expect more Make in India content in our systems.Will Bloom Energy seek to source biogas from local plants for generation of electricity if enough natural gas is not available?This is among the options we are considering, especially in more rural areas.How do you plan to raise funds?As a private company, we dont discuss our funding requirements. We are a very healthy company, well-positioned to execute our business plan.Costs associated with building and maintaining fuel cells are pretty high. How can you change that?We are already economically attractive for certain types of customersthose commercial or government entities that have significant business critical operations that cannot suffer interruption of power. Like any new, transformative technology, Blooms technology is riding a steep cost-down path as innovation and market volume forces come together to bring down cost. We are extremely confident that this trend will continue for many years.How do you rate India companies when it comes to sustainability initiatives?We applaud that sustainability is an increasing focus for India Inc. Much is left to be done and the challenge is significant to improving the sustainability of business operations in India and for the society.What are the three biggest problems with Indias power infrastructure?We see the three biggest challenges as lack of access and adequate supply of electric power to fully support the society, challenges with power reliability and power outages, and still high CO2, high nox (oxides of Nitrogen), sox (oxides of sulphur) and particulate emissions relative to what is possible today with an advanced technology such as Bloom.Whats your advice to young entrepreneurs?Pick something you are passionate (about), because there are so many ups and downs. To be able to still go ahead, that passion needs to be strong. It should be yours and not someone elses.(Theres) nothing wrong in being a capitalist, nothing wrong in wanting to make money. But money is a lot more satisfying, if you also find something that has a social impact.Gireesh Chandra Prasad in New Delhi contributed to this story",2016-10-17,6p08znifFPuASBf1TXMe6I,"KR Sridhar talks about the efficiency of green technology, why India needs it and how Bloom Energy will navigate through challenges unique to the country",01:17,Decentralized gas-fuelled power generation has a bright future: Bloom Energy CEO

0.47,"Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) reported another set of sub-par results, with revenues and operating profit for the quarter ended 30 September declining by more than 4% sequentially in its India operations. The company doesnt report results for its wireless business separately anymore, and the India business is therefore the best proxy for it. 
				   
				Earlier, Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd had reported sequential revenue declines of around 2%, largely due to the seasonality factor. RCom said in a press statement that results for the quarter were impacted by an increase in competitive intensity, migration of CDMA customers to 4G LTE and seasonality factors. Its understandable that the migration attempt will result in some disruption. Average revenue per user rose 5% sequentially, suggesting a larger proportion of low-value customers have been lost. But overall, given the continued sluggishness, theres hardly anything for investors to get excited about. RCom shares have more than halved in the current year, and initial enthusiasm about the companys strategic deals with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd as well as its deleveraging plans has waned.All of the debt-reduction plans the company has talked about are still a work-in-progress and some of them are at fairly preliminary stages. And while the merger of its wireless business with Aircel Ltd may come through, the success of the deal depends largely on how successful the two are in raising a large amount of equity capital in the combined entity. And the current environment, where telecom stocks have fallen at a fast pace, is hardly conducive for raising equity. There is also lack of clarity about RComs arrangements with Reliance Jio for use of the latters 4G network, and how beneficial the deal will be.

0.26,"The Cabinet has approved the spectrum auction plan recommended by the department of telecommunication. The value of the spectrum that is being put up for the auction is more than Rs.5 trillion, based on the proposed reserve price. Hardly anyone expects telecom companies to bid for the entire spectrum; although based on past experience, with Indian telecom firms, you can never say never.
				   
				About three-fourths of the total spectrum on offer, in value terms, is in the 700 megahertz (MHz) band. Telecom firms such as Bharti Airtel Ltd have said that the pricing makes it unaffordable. Also, if the government has managed to make contiguous blocks of 1800MHz spectrum available in the auction, the demand for spectrum in the 700MHz band will naturally be low.Most importantly, the sectors debt is already at monumental levels and based on leverage metrics such as debt/Ebitda, there is hardly any leeway in terms of taking on much additional debt. As such, the Rs.4 trillion worth 700MHz spectrum should ideally be left untouched.Even so, some telecom firms may still explore bidding in a few circlessuch as B and C circles where pricing of this spectrum is not as expensive vis-à-vis other bands. If bidding is restricted to these circles, investors will be largely unconcerned. But if extends to other circles, and telecom firms get bold as they have in some previous auctions, investors have much to worry.As pointed earlier in this column, the governments approach leaves much to be desired. It seems to be least bothered about the financial health of the industry, and is treating it as a golden goose.Of course, the government cant be entirely blamed when telcos themselves have been reckless while bidding in past auctions. According to analysts, this is one of the reasons telecom stocks have underperformed in recent months. The upcoming mega auction is making some investors nervous. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients earlier this year, Even as Bharti India CEO, in the 3QFY16 earnings concall, repeatedly termed the Trais (Telecom Regulatory Authority of Indias) proposed 700MHz spectrum reserve prices unaffordable, we hope we do not end up with a treatise titled Art of buying the unaffordable, volume 3 sometime post the proposed auctions.",2016-06-22,8KBlcj1fZmd8pP2JFG8HcI,"The sectors debt is at monumental levels, but the government seems to be least bothered about its financial health and is treating it as a golden goose

0.9,"Ousted Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry was pushing C. Sivasankaran, who had played dealmaker in several Tata group transactions in the past, to pay up the Siva groups share of the DoCoMo award, and also discussed with the board of the holding company possible legal action against the sometimes controversial, Seychelles-based entrepreneur, documents seen by Mint show.
				   
				On 15 September, at his penultimate Tata Sons board meeting as chairman, Mistry raised this issue, the documents show. He was removed as chairman when the board next met on 24 October.Interestingly, on 19 September, Tata Sons (Tata Teleservices Ltd and NTT DoCoMo Inc. are named as co-respondents) received a legal notice from a firm retained by Sivasankarans Sterling Info-tech Ltd, alleging mismanagement of Tata Teleservices and reserving the right to seek damages to recover its (Sterlings) losses.Mint learns that a decision on how to respond to this email had not been taken till Mistrys exit.Tata group spokesperson Debasis Ray said in an email response to Mints queries that in 2008, when Docomo agreed to acquire shares of Tata Teleservices, Tata Sons voluntarily offered other shareholders of TTSL an opportunity for a pro-rata sale of their holdings. This was subject to the shareholders agreeing to bear a pro-rata portion of any claims or amounts payable to Docomo should such an event arise.... Thereafter in 2014, Docomo exercised the put option. In terms of the agreement with the selling shareholders, Tata Sons demanded from Mr Sivasankaran his pro-rata share of the amount payable to Docomo.Ray added that Tata Sons is pursuing all legal options for recovery of this amount.Mint couldnt ascertain whether the company had responded to Sivasankarans notice. Sivasankaran could not be reached for comment immediately.The notice from Sivasankarans law firm mentions his long-standing association with the Tata Group of Companies on account of his close association with Mr Ratan Tata.Sivasankaran has had several dealings with the group, taking Barista, Indias first coffee chain that the Tata group had acquired, off its hands, selling Dishnet DSL to the Tata-owned VSNL, which subsequently became Tata Communications, and facilitating the sale of the Tata stake in the Birla-Tata-AT&T telecom venture to the Aditya Birla Group, resulting in the formation of Idea Cellular Ltd.In early 2006, the Siva group acquired 520 million shares in Tata Teleservices at Rs 17 per share or Rs884 crore. It paid Rs102 crore towards this, the documents show. It paid the balance in February 2006. Of the Rs782 crore, the documents show that Rs650 crore was funded by a loan from Standard Chartered Bank effectively guaranteed by Tata Sons. The balance Rs132 crore came from Kalimati Investments, a subsidiary of Tata Steel.Ray confirmed both and said that to ensure that in the event of a default on the repayment of the loan, the shares of Tata Teleservices were not sold to a third party, Tata Sons agreed to an arrangement whereby the bank would sell the shares to Tata Sons.He added that a part of the consideration was funded by another Tata company for a few days on market-linked terms.In 2006, when the loan was refunded, the Tata group withdrew this guarantee, and the Siva group had to provided other collateral to the bank, the documents show.Then came the 2008 deal with DoCoMo under which the latter bought shares amounting to 26% of Tata Teleservices equity. Of the 26%, 20% was to be fresh equity and 6%, a sale by existing shareholders. Under this, the documents with Mint show, Sivasankaran sold 20.74 million shares at Rs117.81 apiece, turning a tidy profit.The DoCoMo investment eventually turned sour, and with no initial public offering in sight, the Japanese company exercised a put option. The resulting litigation led to an award of Rs8,450 crore to DoCoMo. Of this, the Siva groups share was Rs694 crore.The September legal notice from the Siva group and a letter to Mistry in October 2013 from Sivasankaran refer to Tata Teleservicess dire need for equity, and present the Siva groups investment in the company as a sort of lifeline.This representation was disputed by Mistry in his response to the letter. I have been advised by Mr (Ratan) Tata that the investment made by the Siva Group was made principally on the consideration that the telecom sector was fast-growing and represented a good investment opportunity. In his letter, Sivasankaran referred to an earlier letter to Ratan Tata in 2011 seeking assistance in finding a buyer for the Siva groups holding in Tata Teleservices.He further asks Mistry for a fair resolution (presumably a buyback of his holdings) in line with the mutually benevolent relation between the Tata group and Siva group which made the Siva group walk the extra miles to support the Tata group by undertaking risks which no financial investor acting in self-interest would.From Rays comments, it looks like that resolution is headed for the courts.",2016-11-09,8UuRA0q7zaqX07hXw3QxPL,"At his penultimate Tata Sons board meeting as chairman, Cyrus Mistry raised the issue, the documents show",01:31,Cyrus Mistry was trying to get Siva group to pay share of DoCoMo award

This vitiated environment poses a huge threat to the global information technology (IT) services industry which depends for its existence on the free flow of ideas, technology and talent.

It is futile to wishfully hope that this too shall pass.

Free trade is based on Adam Smiths thesis of comparative advantage; trading leaves both partners better off. Certainly outsourcing has created a lot of jobs and prosperity in India. However it hasnt done so at the expense of American jobs; rather, by enabling US companies to innovate and be more cost-efficient, Indias technology companies have helped US companies grow and create more jobs in their core businesses. For instance, at the heart of virtually every engineered product whether a Cisco Systems router, a General Electric engine or scanner, or Skype, is code written in India.

				Just a year ago, SoftBank Group Corp.s founder looked poised to fulfil his long-stated plan of stepping aside in his 60s. He had a global telecom empire, track record of spectacularly successful investments and a bright young successor. Instead, the 59-year-old edged aside his heir apparent, cut the biggest deal of his career yet and revealed on Friday his ambition to become one of the worlds most powerful investors.SoftBank said it is forming a new fund to put as much as $100 billion in the global technology industry in the next five years, partnering with Saudi Arabias public investment fund to find companies that will become influential in the future. By comparison, all the venture capital funds in the world disbursed a record $129.5 billion in funding in 2015, according to CB Insights.The man who once proclaimed his goal of creating the worlds most valuable company isnt hiding his ambition: Over the next decade, he aims to be the biggest investor in technology.In other words, Japans second-richest man isnt going anywhere. Son in 2014 brought in Nikesh Arora, luring the former Google executive with a pay package that rivaled those of Apple Inc.s Tim Cook and Walt Disney Co.s Bob Iger. He spent two years grooming him as a successor only to change his mind in June. A month later SoftBank announced plans for a $32 billion takeover of chip designer ARM Holdings Plc, Sons biggest bet to date and a wager on the future of interconnected devices.For some time, it seemed like Son has fatigued, considering retirement and bringing in Arora. It is pretty clear now that he is still full of zeal, said Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive officer of Myojo Asset Management Co.It is not yet clear who will call the shots at what is tentatively named SoftBank Vision Fund and the Japanese company declined to comment further, noting the fund had not yet closed. SoftBank named Rajeev Misra, its head of strategic finance, to lead the project.Son has made tens of billions in returns from investments in companies including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, Yahoo and Supercell Oy, and the new fund will likely pursue a similar strategy of backing technology companies at all stages. While Arora was SoftBanks president, the company had plans to put about $3 billion into startups each year.During his two year tenure, Arora spearheaded investments in Indian e-commerce provider Snapdeal.com, ride-hailing service Ola Cabs, real-estate website Housing.com and hotel-booking app Oyo Rooms. In October 2015, SoftBank led a $1 billion fund-raising round for US-based online lender Social Finance Inc.Over the next decade, the SoftBank Vision Fund will be the biggest investor in the technology sector, Son, chairman and chief executive officer of SoftBank, said in a statement Friday. We will further accelerate the information revolution by contributing to its development.The Saudi government will consider putting money into the fund and become the lead investment partner, SoftBank said in the statement. The Tokyo-based company, which will invest as much as $25 billion, signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with the Saudis, who may put in as much as $45 billion over the next five years. Other large global investors may participate to increase the pool to $100 billion.Also Read: SoftBank tech fund to invest up to $100 billion with Saudi ArabiaSoftBank said that the fund will be reflected on its consolidated financial statements, without giving further details. Its shares rose as much as 3.7% in Tokyo. The stock had gained 5.8% this year before today, compared with a 12% decline in the benchmark Nikkei 225 index.The company is stepping up investment activity even though it has more than $100 billion in debt. SoftBank has relied on borrowing and earnings from its domestic telecom operations to pay for investments in start-ups in India, US and China while balancing losses at its US subsidiary Sprint Corp. By tapping outside investors, Son will be able to cut more ambitious deals than he could on his own.Also Read: SoftBanks robot Pepper gets to work at Taiwan bankARM acquisition has brought Son to a limit of how much he can invest just with SoftBanks balance sheet, Myojos Kikuchi said.The companys high-speed Internet and wireless services in Japan generated 1.16 trillion yen ($11.2 billion) of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the fiscal year ended 31 March. SoftBank has 3.5 trillion yen of bonds maturing in the next five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Its conceivable that after capturing the core of the Internet of Things with ARM, Son will next look to other semiconductors, electronic components and software, said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute in Tokyo. SoftBank has a proven track record of investment successes.

0.49,"Brussels: Online messaging and email services such as WhatsApp, iMessage and Gmail will face tough new rules on how they can track users under a proposal presented by the European Union executive on Tuesday.
				   
				The web players will have to guarantee the confidentiality of their customers conversations and ask for their consent before tracking them online to serve them personalised ads.The proposal by the European Commission extends some rules that now only apply to telecom operators to web companies offering calls and messages using the internet, known as Over-The-Top (OTT) services, seeking to close a perceived regulatory gap between the telecoms industry and mainly US Internet giants such as Facebook, Google and Microsoft.Tuesdays proposal would allow telecom companies to use customer metadata  such as the duration and location of calls  to provide additional services and make more money, something they are barred from doing under the current rules.However the telecoms industry said the proposal still imposed stricter obligations on them than on web companies.Unlike others, telcos risk being prevented from expanding consumer choice by using traffic and location data for big data analytics, IoT (Internet of Things) and connected driving services, said Lise Fuhr, director general of ETNO, the European telecoms lobby.The review of the so-called e-privacy law will also require web browsers to ask users upon installation whether they want to allow websites to place cookies on their browsers. A previous leaked version would have forced browsers to set the default settings as not allowing cookies.Its up to our people to say yes or no, said Andrus Ansip, Commission vice-president for the digital single market.Cookies are placed on web surfers computers and contain bits of information about the user, such as what other sites they have visited or where they are logging in from. They are widely used by companies to deliver targeted ads to users.Online advertisers have warned that overly strict rules would undermine many websites ability to fund themselves and keep offering free services. They say the data they use can not identify the user and is therefore low risk, making asking for consent every time too onerous.It will particularly hit those companies that ... find it most difficult to talk directly to end users and what I mean by that is tech companies that operate in the background and sort of facilitate the buying and selling of advertising rather than the ones that the user directly engages with, said Yves Schwarzbart, head of policy and regulatory affairs at the Internet Advertising Bureau.Companies falling foul of the new law will face fines of up to 4% of their global turnover, in line with a separate data protection law set to enter into force in 2018.The proposal will need to be approved by the European Parliament and member states before becoming law.

0.44,"The first ever London Design Biennale opened this month at Somerset House. Around three dozens nations from six continents were invited to present installations on the theme of Utopia by Design. The India Design Forum spearheaded the Indian installation: Chakraview, curated by Rajshree Pathy. In an interview, Pathy who is chairperson and managing director of Rajshree Sugars and Chemicals Ltd and founder of the India Design Forum, spoke about the exhibit, and the precarious position of design in Indian life. Edited excerpts:
How did you approach the two very complex ideas of India and utopia, and then combine them for this exhibit?It was very challenging for us actually because the Indian utopia exists at multiple levels. We asked a few people around what is their idea of utopia. The answers are so diverse. It could be easily, somebodys meal. On the other hand, it could be a flat in Gurgaon. It could be a private jet. It could be your son going to a good school. Utopias for India are so diverse and yet we coexist with this tension that comes out of these diverse desires. Taking on from that premise, I needed to base this installation on something that had a thread of consistency in every Indians mind. Therefore, as a curator, I thought its best to have references to our mythology, to our learnings. And I tried to keep it as far removed as possible from any political or religious inferences.Then we looked at references to utopias in our mythologies. There are, in fact, many instances of utopian references. There was one reference to this ideal community called uttarakur. The other idea that came to my mind was the whole chakravyuha. We all go through a chakravyuhaevery individual goes through this manoeuvring of lifes passageways, ultimately to emerge into enlightenment or liberation. Therefore, along with the designers, we thought the chakravyuha would be a good manifestation of this installation. We eventually settled on Chakraview as the title. And then we interpret the seven chakras in our utopian view of India.You chose to stay away from religion or politics in your interpretation of an Indian utopia. This is an interesting approach. Do you think both of those thingsreligion and politicsstand between many Indians and the utopian life they desire? I think politics and religion play a role in any nations existence. You cannot remove the importance of politics and religion.One unique aspect of Chakraview is that it is one of the few exhibits here that are orderly and have a certain spatial symmetry. Does this reflect the fact that one common aspect of every Indians personal utopia is orderliness and symmetry? Is that the thread that binds all these visions? A harking for order?Symmetry is very important because it brings a certain order to disorderliness. It requires a certain discipline. I think in all the noise and colour of the exhibit, there is an order. There is also an element of government policymaking and collaboration in the exhibit. There is a video that connects the history of Indian design to the future of Indian policymaking.Why not? This is also a country-branding exercise. All such biennales are an opportunity to highlight what a country has to offer to the design world. It took a lot of work to get the government to endorse it. Because governments are used to trade fairs. They are used to exhibitions. They are used to conferences. Not design biennales.They want to sign MoUs (memorandums of understanding) at the end of something like this presumably?They didnt understand biennales. Im very happy that weve broken that constraint. We have put India on that map. It is about tourism, it is about textiles, it is about manufacturing, it is about everything else and this is quintessential India. We are a progressing country, and we have our own utopias. That is a challenge to show off. But this is all part of a broader plan you have for Indian design, especially as part of the India Design Forum.The larger agenda is to really create or design infrastructure which is both policy driven and private sector driven that will enable young designers. We have an NID (National Institute of Design) and a few other private design schools. Is that sufficient for a country the size of India? Absolutely not. I want to help designers to actually create businesses and add value to the businesses, allow them to market themselves and be Indian global designers as well. Today all your automotive companies have their design studios out of India. This has to change.What is holding us back from becoming a global design powerhouse?The problem is the mindset. We have to stop saying we are a poor country, we are a poor country. We have our multiple utopias because multiple problems exist, but you have to handle them at the same time. You cannot reduce everything to the common denominator of poverty. Once you reduce everything to a single metric then we start thinking: This is not better or that is not well, this is not important that is not important. Everything is important. We have killed the creative legacy of India by reducing everything to good or bad.Is that because of this tremendous utilitarianism that we have?Utilitarianism is fine, but design and innovation are part of utilitarianism. How can you design a pen, how can you design anything without thinking about its utility? There is a central philosophy: we must do more with less. We are obsessed with this. Why not do more with more? Instead we design products that do their job in the most basic ways possible. We dont care how many people will use it, we dont care about the different people who use a product, we dont care about ease of use. But we should. Unfortunately design is seen as being a superfluous. Design is art and therefore unessential. But that is totally wrong. Design is all about making functional products.Is that the problem. That we dont see the difference between those two things? Design and art?No, we dont see the difference. Even journalists dont understand it. Im forever asked this question. What is the definition of art and design? And then there are people who think that good design is all about handbags and shoes.Im passionate about it. We have lost our creative legacy which is why despite all the big, huge Indian conglomerates that are in IT, we will never produce a Steve Jobs. Because we only do jobwork. We have to learn to create.How do you stop that? How do you intervene? What intervention do you need?You need a change in the mindset. You need a government that thinks that creativity is important. That it is innovation and design that transforms cities into liveable harmonious spaces. You have to have more design schools. You have to have design thinking. You have to have design in your vocabulary in government. But we think good design is elitist. Because it is art. And we think art is elitist. While the procurement of art may be elitist, the people who make art are not elitist. Art itself is not elitist.

				That query posed by Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev at the Isha Foundations annual leadership workshop for entrepreneurs resonated with many attendees, including Deepak Satwalekar, the former managing director and chief executive officer of HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. Ltd.It makes you think and reflect on what your priorities should be. Dont go around trying to fix the world. Fix yourself first, and the rest will follow, said Satwalekar, who has been a resource leader at the annual event since it first started five years ago with the aim of helping small businesses scale up.This year, INSIGHT: The DNA of Success programme, led by Sadhguru, will take place from 24 to 27 November and will feature State Bank of India chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya, Piramal Group and Shriram Group Chairman Ajay Piramal, former Kellogg and INSEAD dean Dipak Jain, former Britannia Industries Ltd MD Vinita Bali, TeamIndus fleet commander Rahul Narayan, Shoppers Stop Ltd non-executive vice-chairman B.S. Nagesh, and textiles minister Smriti Zubin Irani. Mint is a partner of the programme.So what draws so many corporate leaders, academics and entrepreneurs to the event held every year at the Coimbatore headquarters of Sadhgurus Isha Foundation?You will learn several things that you were not taught in management school or at work, and get a chance to be inspired by Sadhguru, said Shanker Annaswamy, the former MD of IBM India Pvt. Ltd.For instance, the workshop helped Sapan Jain summon the courage to leave his corporate job at International Business Machines Corp. and start reverse logistics service provider Blubirch, and alter his entire approach towards problem-solving. It taught him to focus on the variables he could control rather than obsessing over the potential consequences of a situation, ranging from the departure of a key employee to a promised investment falling through.All of us read business books. All of us hear business leaders. Sometimes, (all of that) beyond a point can get vegetative and monotonous. When you hear a different perspective which is still very pragmatic and practical (such as Sadhgurus), it makes a lot of sense, Jain said.Vikash Agrawal, the promoter of power plant equipment maker Hi-Tech Systems & Services Ltd. (HTSSL), agreed.The insights he gleaned there have become a kind of another management book for me, said Agrawal, who is planning to attend the event yet again this year.Agarwal has made sure to implement some of the business lessons he learned at the event, including the fail early concept and the 90-day rule proposed by BRICS Bank chief K.V. Kamath in a bid to set a limit on the time a company should pilot a new idea before moving on.This is exactly why management gurus such as Ram Charan recommend the workshop.The single most reason (that makes this workshop unique) is that the learning is done from the practitioners, Charan said.The resource leaders, who act as informal mentors to entrepreneurs at the event, come from diverse backgrounds and sectors, making it almost a certainty that a participant will find someone he or she will be able to relate with personally and professionally, former attendees said.Also, unlike years past, this years event will include more structured modules on specific topics and include more women and people from the manufacturing, said programme facilitator Nagesh.For Nagesh, the biggest challenge is to make the workshop equally appealing to somebody whose companys sales are Rs10 crore and another who runs a Rs1,000 crore firm. That said, he believes the programme is fairly unique because of the fact that the spiritual part is actually integrated into it. The events faculty chair, Dipak Jain, too has been fascinated by Sadhgurus focus on inner engineering.First you have to be a better person before you start a better business or a better society, Jain said.The programme has proved to be an eye opener for not just the entrepreneurs but also for those who have been past speakers or mentors.Everyone has their own struggle and sometimes understanding how others dealt with their own challenges, can give us the inspiration to move forward, said Dr. Reddys Laboratories Ltd co-chairman and CEO G.V. Prasad.Prasad encouraged entrepreneurs to practise a mantra he learned from Sadhguru that those who want to scale up must learn to let go of their current state without fear and move to a higher plane, akin to trapeze artists, while Satwalekar urged them to stay hungry for knowledge, learn to prioritise, surround themselves with smarter people and not be afraid of failure.For many, like Varda Shine, the former CEO of De Beers Diamond Trading Co, the main draw of the program is Sadhguru, whose way of looking at leadership and success is much wider than any other business learning.And former participants across the board have a simple piece of advice for anyone looking to attend the event this year.As Anupal Banerjee, senior vice president  human resources, Viacom18 Media Pvt.

0.37,"Bhaskar Pramanik, chairman of Microsoft Corp. (India) Pvt. Ltd, steered marketing, operations, and business development efforts of the worlds largest software company in India for the last five years. Even as Anant Maheshwari handles the sales, marketing and services operations of Microsoft in India from 1 January, Pramanik, who also led Microsofts interactions with policy makers, customers, and business partners, continues as chairman until 31 March. In an interview, he outlined the companys strategy and vision for digital transformation. Edited excerpts:
Digital transformation is todays buzzword. How has it impacted Microsofts strategy?Our mission is to empower individuals and organizations to achieve more. If you notice, we dont talk about technology in our mission statement. The reason is that while technology will continuously keep evolving, our mission will remain the same. This is also based on our three primary ambitions, which I refer to as platforms, and which we believe we are the best at.The first is personal computing. It is not just about a personal computer. It is about the mobility of the experience, the Internet of Things (IoT), it is about augmented and virtual reality. Its the way you access computing through touch, make it accessible in multiple different languages, and enable even differently-abled people to interact with computing because computing has become all pervasive. Computing will come in different shapes and sizes. This is already happening. Today, most people have multiple IP (internet protocol) addresses in the more connected parts of the world. This is core for strategy. The second is about productivity and business processes. It is not just about productivity of the individual but productivity of groups, of enterprises, of an entire industry. Consider what we created for eyecare with L V Prasad Eye Institute the story that is called the Connected Eye. We set up a consortium called MINEMicrosoft Intelligent Network for Eyesso that all the different segments of the eyecare industry can get the benefit of sharing anonymous patient data to do far better patient care. So people may think us as an Office company but we are helping doctors do much more with analytics.The third is the Intelligent Cloud, which enables the first two platforms. This is the intelligence that Satya (Nadella) recently talked about. The fourth industrial revolution is all about data, and data is what makes artificial intelligence possible. You can use the humongous data to predict, for compliance purposes and that is why the cloud is not just a storehouse for data but a way by which you can mine this data to solve different problems and challenges that the world faces.What does this approach mean to your customers?Whether our customer is the government, education or SMBs (small and medium-sized businesses), it is all about how we can help our customers empower their employees; how we can help them to engage with their customers differently; how can we help them to optimize their business and transform their business.Transformation is about business model changing. So if you have a connected product or service, your whole business model changes because you dont charge for the productyou charge for the service. Second is about differentiated customer experiences. We have transformed the way people buy. Analytics is now built into everything we do because that gives you the power of datathe ability to actually take better informed decisions. Finally, it is about using IoT to make processes, products intelligent.This did require a cultural changeAll this would not have been possible if we hadnt changed the culture of the company. I strongly believe that culture is as strong as strategy. And that is true for Microsoft. Our ability to have moved so quickly is because of the change weve made in our culture, led by what Satya has been doing (see box: Nadella in the drivers seat). The culture is based on a fundamental belief which we call a growth mindset. Every individual has the opportunity to learn from his mistakes, learn continuously and develop himself.Microsoft emphasizes diversity and inclusion. Could you elaborate?We have learnt that it is the diversity of ideas which is very critical for any culture that has a growth mindset. Ideas can come from any part of the organization, any gender, from very young peoplethis is critical to becoming an inclusive organization. And being an MNC, we have the ability to sell across geographies and segments. Next, we have very strong technical people but they typically work in silos. We have very large teams in these areas here (in India) so we can build solutions that can be extended to the developed world or even create solutions for the developed parts (like banks and financial institutions) of India and be exported to the Western world. This is how we look at One Microsoft. This is the message we give our partners and customers.",2017-01-05,B1BNWqoulb7ZRthL1mW94M,Microsoft India chairman Bhaskar Pramanik on the companys strategy and vision for digital transformation,02:05,"Analytics is now built into everything we do, says Microsoft India chairman"

				This time a kerfuffle at its Westinghouse Electric Co. nuclear-power division is forcing the Japanese industrial conglomerate to spin off its memory-chip businesses, prepping the unit for a sale of a minority stake.So far, the talk is that such a sale will amount to only 20% of the businessenough to raise some cash, but not so much as to give up control. Toshiba wants to keep its chip cake and eat it, too.A minority purchase alone doesnt hold much strategic value for an investor, as theyd ride the roller-coaster of a highly unstable memory-chip industry, yet without enough control to affect change or combine operations.Doubtless theres enough private-equity money out there to find someone willing to roll the dice. And of course existing strategic partner Western Digital Corp. would also be an obvious choice. A WD investment may face antitrust concerns, however, so such a deal isnt assured, Bloomberg News reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.Chinese investors, though, wont face any antitrust concerns and likely have a far bigger appetite for accepting instability as the price for getting a seat at the table. Lack of strategic access wouldnt be ideal, but this could be seen as a first entree into the market.Then theres politics. Theres a case to be made that a Chinese investment in a non-US company would sail through political opposition more easily than other tie-ups, given the role the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS) plays in scuttling deals. If a hungry Chinese investor buys into that thesis, then theyre likely to seize on the rare opportunity to get access to a major name in semiconductors. For Toshiba, knowing such investors are out there should embolden its executives to seek a higher price from any bidders.

0.9,"Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is likely to report an increase in its quarterly profit, as stronger petrochemical margins offset weaker earnings from its refining business. 
				   
				Consolidated net profit is likely to increase to Rs7,282.5 crore on a revenue of Rs63,669.9 crore for the three months ended on 30 September, according to a Bloomberg poll of six analysts. In the year-earlier quarter, the company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs6,720 crore and revenue of Rs75,117 crore. RIL will announce its second-quarter earnings on Thursday. After six consecutive sequential earnings increases, we expect RILs standalone earnings to moderate 2% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), mainly due to weaker refining. But, RIL may surprise again. We expect another record petchem EBIT, said Nomura Research in a 7 October note to clients. Ebit stands for earnings before interest and taxes and is an indication of a companys profitability. RILs refining and marketing business, which accounts for over 75% of revenue and more than 60% of profit, could be hurt due to lower refining margins.Analysts expect RILs gross refining margin (GRM) to be $9.5-10 per barrel. GRM is the realization from turning every barrel of crude oil into finished products. We estimate GRM to be down 10% QoQ (quarter on quarter) while throughput 7% higher QoQ following a restart of special economic zone crude distillation unit after 20 days maintenance shutdown in May 2016. Refining EBITDA will therefore fall 6% QoQ, said Edelweiss Research in a 5 October report. During the September quarter, Singapore GRM averaged at $5.1 per barrel compared with $5 in the preceding three months.We expect RIL to report a $10 GRM versus $11.5 in 1Q, the latter including $2 of hedging & inventory gains, said Citi Research in its report dated 4 October. Earnings from the petrochemicals segment, however, are expected to rise on higher volume and wider margins. We expect petchem earnings to show strong growth led by higher volumes (some expansion projects are gradually reflecting in earnings) and improved spreads in the polymer chain, said IDFC Securities in a report dated 5 October. On the exploration and production (E&P) front, which includes domestic assets and US shale gas assets, the second quarter could also be a loss-making one for RIL as crude oil and domestic gas prices are lower compared to last year. Production from the KG block is also expected to be lower. RIL is likely to report losses in a small EBIT profit on domestic E&P. US shale will continue to remain loss-making. Crude oil and domestic gas prices are lower year-on-year. KG D6 production is expected to be down 3% year-on-year, said Bank of America Merrill Lynch in a report dated 10 October. Though RIL launched its telecom services on 5 September, the numbers are not likely to be included in September quarter. We do not expect the company to account for Jio in its consolidated results despite its launch in September as it is currently being offered to customers for free.

0.25,"Dallas: Clear, the biometric screening firm long hobbled by a limited network, is landing in several major US airports soon, including New Yorks LaGuardia, marking the start of an era that could radically accelerate your trip from curb to cabin. But there are some bumps to smooth out first.
				   
				Clear, which started at JFK International Airport earlier this month, will open screening lanes at LaGuardia and Atlantas Hartsfield-Jackson in the next few days, followed by Los Angeles International and Minneapolis-St. Paul by April. All told, the expansion will put Clear at 22 major airports, covering the majority of domestic American flights, according to the company.Clear doesnt replace TSA PreCheck so much as complement it. It checks travellers identities with a fingerprint or iris scan, eliminating the boarding pass and identity checks. That lets Clear members proceed directly to bag and body screening. The company says about 65% of its users at the busiest airports have also enrolled in PreCheck, allowing them to retain their shoes, belts, and laptops during the screening.Clear is a reincarnation of the verified-identification idea begun by journalist Steven Brill in 2003. That company ran out of money and shut down in 2009. It was purchased in bankruptcy the following year for about $6 million by investors including Clears current CEO, former hedge fund manager Caryn Seidman-Becker. Other stakeholders include T. Rowe Price Group Inc., Sterling Equities, investor Bill Miller, and former executives of Priceline Group Inc. (Clear also offers security checks at various professional sports arenas.)The New York-based company, in which Delta Air Lines Inc. holds a 5% stake, has been working hard to expand its network to the point where veteran air travelers would view it as comprehensive. Glaring omissions at some major hubs, such as Chicago OHare and Newark Liberty, have made some frequent fliers disinclined to consider paying for the service. In order to provide the best service and to meet the expectations of our members, we have to be in all the right airports, said David Cohen, Clears chief administrative officer. Thats really important. There are other obstacles still facing Clear. Its lanes, for one, arent always located in the same terminals that have the bulk of an airports traffic.At both Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston-Bush airports, for example, Clears lanes are in terminals not used by the dominant carriers at those hubs, American Airlines Group Inc. and United Continental Holdings Inc., respectively. Cohen said each airport has different needs and requirements about where Clear can establish screening.Clear charges $179 annually, with new enrollees receiving a one-month trial for free. The company has also experimented with a variety of pricing promotions, such as $29 for a three-month enrolment last summer. Members of Deltas SkyMiles frequent flier program get discounted memberships, while Delta covers the cost for its top-level elite members. Clear members can add a spouse or domestic partner for $50, and children 17 and younger are free.Clear says it has more than 700,000 members nationwide and will surpass 1 million in the next few months, with annual enrollment growth of 110%.If Clear reaches critical mass and becomes a viable option for all who wish to enroll, it may face a bigger problem: success. More travelers using Clear may spell longer queues at airports that already face space constraints. Isnt Clear useful to its customers precisely because its audience is limited? Cohen said the company hasnt yet faced this problem, even as it processes upwards of 2,000 travelers each day at its busiest locations. And the tech firm has an advantage when it comes to that issue, he said: By using technology like automated kiosks, it can expand without hiring more employees.

				In a series of tweets by Mallya on Friday morning, he claimed that the CBI made such a great drama accusing the Marans and putting them to great harm. What finally happened? Did truth prevail or CBI prevail? I am shocked at CBI allegations. All false and misconceived to say the least. What do a bunch of elite police know about business and economics?Mallya also went on to claim that he was being made a pawn in a political game. He said, Media happily being used as the pitch. I am the football. Two fiercely competitive teams National Democratic Alliance (NDA) versus United Progressive Alliance (UPA) playing. Unfortunately there are no referees. (sic)The Congress was quick to respond to Mallyas claims, stating that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was shielding him.The BJP started by making Mallya a Rajya Sabha MP. In 2015 the CBI had issued a lookout notice in 2015, which has now been withdrawn from all airports. Last year, before Mallya left, he had also met a senior cabinet minister who had tipped him off and helped him leave, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala told Mint.Surjewala also stated that Union finance minister Arun Jaitleys budget speech which aimed at cracking down on black money launderers was a complete farce, with the party being completely dishonest in its approach towards cracking down on Mallya.Under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) an offenders assets can be confiscated and attached. Why has that not been done? The FMs speech means nothing if the party is being dishonest when it comes to prosecuting the ilk of Mallya and Lalit Modi. The party helped Mallya escape to foreign shores, where he gets money in his offshore account with the party complicit in this, Surjewala added.The BJP, however, remained silent on the matter.The party will not comment on any of these allegations or issues while the Parliament is in session. It is against legislation to comment on matters which may come up in Parliament and then we will take a call on this, said a senior BJP leader, requesting anonymity.Late on Thursday night, Mallya also alleged that the CBI was systematically framing him in a conspiracy.The CBI selectively releasing e-mails to media which are being taken out of context and distorted to make allegations against me and UPA regime, he wrote on Twitter.The CBI however, told Mint that this was a desperate attempt by Mallya to wade out of the airtight charges that had been made against him.Charges have been filed and we have now set the ball rolling for his extradition. If Vijay Mallya is not to blame, then why did he run away from the country? We are confident that the United Kingdom will extradite him because we have a very strong case against him.

0.01,"Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) had reported a premium of $3.1 per barrel over the Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) for the March quarter. For the June quarter, that premium was expected to expand further. However, the reported premium of $6.5 per barrel, the highest in the last eight years according to RIL, far exceeded Street estimates. Most analysts had estimated the companys GRM to be in the range of $9.5-10 per barrel. On the contrary, RILs GRM in the June quarter came in at $11.5 per barrel.
				   
				There are a couple of reasons for this outperformance. One, as Alok Agarwal, chief financial officer at RIL, said, We did have a build-up in inventory towards the end of last quarter and we were able to liquidate that inventory at better prices than at the end of the last quarter. Secondly, middle distillates, which include gas oil (diesel) and aviation fuel and account for nearly 45% of the companys product slate, performed better. Our crude sourcing was competitive too, pointed out Agarwal.Even as the GRM beat is strong, not everybody is impressed. Theres no point in taking a call on GRM alone, said independent analyst S.P. Tulsian. He added that looking at inventory at the end of the last fiscal year, it is likely that inventory gains, perhaps to the extent of approximately $2.5 per barrel, are included in the reported GRM.Nonetheless, the fact remains that a strong performance by the refining segment did help the company beat analysts estimates by a good margin. But its worth remembering that the RIL stock has already gone up in the past five trading sessions.Moreover, the performance of other business segments is not very encouraging. Sure, petrochemicals business Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin improved to 14.9% from 14% in the March quarter. But that was largely in line with Street estimates. While the oil and gas business reported an Ebit of Rs.48 crore compared with a loss in the March quarter, it hardly moves the needle for RIL. Losses of US shale operations increased.Stand-alone revenue declined about 19%, reflecting the decline in broader crude oil prices, while net profit increased about 19% to Rs.7,548 crore. That was because of a 628 basis point jump in operating profit margin to 20%, while depreciation cost declined 3% and other income increased 18.5%, helping net profit growth. A basis point is 0.01%.What of the stock? RIL shares have underperformed the benchmark Sensex since it announced its March quarter numbers. Some reasons for the underperformance can be attributed to the fact that the company had guided analysts about delays in commissioning of its downstream projects, lower refining margin environment and lack of clarity on the timelines of its telecom launch.Currently, one RIL share trades at about 11 times its estimated earnings per share for this fiscal year. Of course, news flow on the telecom launch will be an important measure to track and so will developments on commissioning of downstream expansion projects. In the near term, what is worrisome is that Singapore refining margins have hardly improved. Even as RIL delivered a great beat in the June quarter, the pertinent questions are whether that will sustain. As of now, analysts dont see inventory gains recurring for the current quarter.The crude spreads that are relevant to RILs refineries have contracted in June and July 2016 from levels in April and May 2016, according to ICICI Securities Ltd. This contraction of light-heavy crude spread would hit RILs GRM if it sustains, wrote analysts from ICICI Securities in a note on 7 July. Unfortunately for investors, it could well mean that the robust GRM performance seen last quarter may not be repeated in the current one.The writer does not have positions in the companies discussed here.",2016-07-16,BYyVceR6MiTJTGQ0FWjPEK,"Most analysts had estimated its gross refining margins to be $9.5-10 per barrel; on the contrary, RILs margins in the June quarter came in at $11.5 per barrel

0.67,"Vodafone Group Plc said it was hit by an impairment charge of 6.38 billion ($6.86 billion) with respect to its investment in India. After accounting for a deferred tax asset, the net impairment charge was lower at 5 billion. A little over six years ago, it had written down goodwill and other intangible assets by £2.3 billion ($3.33 billion).
				   
				On both occasions, the company cited an increase in competitive pressure, leading to a reassessment of profit growth projections, which led to large write-downs in the carrying value of Vodafones India assets. Its worthwhile noting here that Vodafone had paid a hefty premium while acquiring the India operations in 2007, and it isnt surprising that the bloated value of intangible assets have to be periodically written down.Even so, Vodafones impairment charge this time around looks fairly high, at more than double the previous one. Note that so far this year, market capitalizations of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd have fallen by around $2 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, reflecting the large value erosion in the sector. As such, the large write-down only underscores the troubles the sector is facing. Six years ago, when the previous impairment charge was taken by Vodafone, it had assumed Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) growth of 17.5% on an average in the five years till March 2015. Interestingly, organic profit growth ranged 15-20% during this period, although it fell sharply to 4.1% in fiscal year 2015-16. With the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, sluggish growth rates are expected to continue. The growth assumptions for the current impairment testing assume Ebitda growth of 7.8% on an average in the next five years. A new entrant has recently launched free trial services for an extended time period and commercial price plans that were at a significant discount to prevailing market pricing, resulting in competitive responses from other operators. This has created a high degree of uncertainty over a range of commercial planning assumptions including future pricing, profitability and market structure, the company said in a statement. This is perhaps the first official acknowledgment that Reliance Jios launch has been hugely value destructive. Strangely enough, despite the diminishing returns from the sector, large companies are increasing capital expenditure to retain market share. As a result, return ratios are falling from already low levels. The only silver lining, from an investors perspective, is that share prices of Indian telcos have already fallen sharply in recent months, and seem to be pricing in a fairly bad future.",2016-11-16,Bd3qtEbVPw0PwNRCxQwYxH,"At 6.38 billion, Vodafones impairment charge this time around looks fairly high, at more than double the previous one",07:51,"Vodafone sees sluggish growth, thanks to Reliance Jio"
0.69,"Last November, when Idea Cellular Ltd agreed to pay top dollar for Videocon Telecommunications Ltds spectrum, it looked like the much-awaited consolidation in the industry was becoming a costly exercise. But Idea Cellular has walked out of the deal, and while Videocon has found another buyer in Bharti Airtel Ltd, valuations have come crashing down. 
				   
				Its premature to conclude that rationality has returned to the industry. Even so, the Videocon deal has some heartening takeawaysof course, for everyone except Videocon. The delay in Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds launch means companies can breathe a bit easier. And the likelihood that the government will harmonize spectrum in 1800 megahertz (MHz) band before this years auction means that this resource may not be as scarce as was earlier feared. Idea Cellular had agreed to pay Rs.3,310 crore for contiguous 1800MHz spectrum in Gujarat and UP (West) circles. This effectively worked out to a 133% premium vis-à-vis the latest reserve price recommended by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. By the same measure, Videocon may have expected another Rs.3,000 crore for the remaining four circles in which it has similar spectrum. That means the amount for all six circles would be about Rs.6,610 crore. Instead, it has agreed to sell spectrum in all six circles to Bharti Airtel for a much lower amount of Rs.4,428 crore. While Videocon has settled for lower valuations vis-à-vis last November, the sale price represents a 100% premium to its purchase price. Another way to look at the deal is that Bharti Airtel is acquiring the spectrum at 34% of the last discovered price for 900MHz spectrum in these circles, whereas Idea Cellular had agreed to pay as much as 55% for the two circles it had agreed to buy. According to analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, the price of 1800 relative to the price of 900 was 35% in A-category circles and 47% in metro circles in the March 2015 auctions. Bharti Airtel, therefore, appears to have struck a reasonable deal, especially keeping in mind that the entire spectrum is contiguous and hence suitable for deploying 4G services. The six circles contribute to 23% of Bharti Airtels revenue. Also, it will now have 4G spectrum in 19 circles, versus 15 earlier. Bhartis 4G-1800 spectrum footprint is now slightly better than that of Reliance Jio, JM Financials analysts wrote in a 17 March note. Interestingly, while Bharti Airtel shares rose 1.3% on the National Stock Exchange on Thursday, those of Idea Cellular gained 3.15%. Of course, investors will be relieved that Idea Cellular backed out of the expensive deal. And as far as the gaps in its 4G footprint go, the auction later this year is likely to provide opportunities to fill them. Besides, as pointed out earlier, with the delay in Reliance Jios launch, companies have been able to breathe a bit easy. Having said all this, the industry is far from being out of the woods. At best, Idea Cellular may have ended up saving about Rs.1,000 crore, which isnt much, considering that it had paid as much as Rs.30,000 crore in the March 2015 auction.

				Growth in both revenue and profit declined, largely because of a higher-than-expected drop in realizations, but also because of lower volume growth.The big surprise in the results was the sharp deceleration in growth in the data segment. In the case of Idea Cellular Ltd, data revenue grew 45% year-on-year last quarter, a sharp drop from the over 80% growth just two quarters ago. Price realizations in the segment fell by as high as 17% year-on-year. For Bharti Airtel Ltd, data realizations fell 13.1% last quarter, much higher than the 5.6% drop reported in the September quarter.Idea Cellulars management said in a note to investors, (there is) intense pressure on the mobile data realized rate, as wireless broadband consumer demand growth is slower than increased supply from operators launching/expanding 3G/4G footprints. Its quite disheartening, from an investors perspective, that this is happening even ahead of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds launch. Supply will increase manifold when Jio launches its services commercially.Incumbents such as Idea and Bharti have spent vast amounts of money in purchasing spectrum, and have stepped up capital expenditure to capitalize on the data opportunity. The December quarter results suggest that data is proving to be a drag rather than a money-spinner. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities wrote in a note to clients, We are slightly concerned about the data volume trajectory, especially in the context of accelerated 3G/4G network rollouts by the operators. We, however, think it is too early to call out a definitive trend here.Investors are taking a very grim view of the future. Idea Cellulars shares have corrected by nearly one-fourth so far this year, and while Bhartis shares have been fairly resilient, returns for investors remain abysmal.

0.25,"When was the last time you listened to music on an actual CD? Or read the days headlines in a physical newspaper? Chances are it has been years. Digital technology and software has replaced a lot of things in our lives.
				   
				According to media futurist Robert Tercek, going forward, we will see more of vaporization, a term he has coined to refer to the process of replacing physical things with software that can be downloaded to any device. The apps on your phone have quietly replaced newspapers, books, music players, diaries and countless other things.We are moving from millions to billions, to trillions of connected devices, and the invisible world of software is growing at twice the rate of the normal economy, says Tercek.As more people connect to the network, the software of the network becomes more valuable and that drives even more people to connect, increasing the value of the network. In an interview, Tercek, the former president of digital media at The Oprah Winfrey Network and author of the book Vaporized, talks about how software is disrupting society. Edited excerpts:You say we are moving to a software-defined society. How is that changing the way the economy functions?The first rule thats important for the software world is this idea that the network is more valuable and the devices get cheaperthat changes the economics. Its very difficult for manufacturing companies to understand that in the future products will be cheaper, but also more valuable. Devices will get cheaper and smarter. Metcalfes Law says the network will get more valuable over time. For the end-users, things cost less, so they expect devices to be cheaper and smarter and they expect to get more value out of them. For companies that manufacture products, this is very difficult. Those companies are vulnerable to Internet economics, the economics of Facebook or Google. Thats a challenge that most havent realized.All companies will become software companies. The implication of that has not yet sunk in and many companies are still operating in old industrial styles. They seldom realize that software is far more important than the physical product. Auto manufacturers, for instance, dont see themselves as software companies; they see themselves as car makers. They think the value is in the metal, rubber and plastic. The value is very quickly moving to software. The companies that focus on software for auto are going to be most successful. We saw the same thing in personal computers, mobile phones and consumer electronics: software eventually became more important than the physical device.Which industries are most prone to vaporization? Are any immune?No industry is immune. I also think that governments, education and healthcare will soon be affected, so this is a mega trend that will reshape the whole society. The industries that have been most affected so far are finance, media, consumer electronics and advertising. The next that will be transformed are healthcare, transportation, education and insurance. Everything that happened in infotech during the past 40 years will soon happen to every other industry in the world. So, in a way, you can see that any business that involves geographytransportation, logistics or shoppingwill be transformed into information businesses. Biology is becoming an information science as well, so agriculture, pharmaceuticals, healthcare and the food industry are going to change. We are now able to program biology in the same way we program a computer.Manufacturing is going to be transformed in a couple of ways. The first one is, of course, robotics. Robotics is the replacement of human labour with software, thats what software automation is. The other trends that are important as well are 3D printing and nanotechnology. Theres already now a 3D printer from Revolution Medicine that will take any substance and break it down to its molecular parts, sort them out and then using software, recompose those molecules into new forms, including combinations that dont exist in nature When things are replaced by software, it means that the barriers that constraintime and spaceare eliminated, because software can deliver instantly. China and Asia, the places that we have been outsourcing manufacturing for the US and Europe, (will) no longer have their big advantage. It will erode because now you will be able to manufacture in any place using software.How are governments changing the way they function?In the past, most governments used human labour to enforce regulation and process paper and handle information. In both cases, software can do a better job. When you have sensors measuring everything, you dont need human regulators checking everything. You can simply do that with software and have better data than we get from human inspectors, so enforcement regulation will change tremendously. In future, we will be able to write the rule in software and encode in a bitcoin(-style) blockchain. All the sensors that are connected to the system will simply report the data and we will have software-defined regulation.In a representative democracy, voting is also [going to be] encoded in the blockchain very soon. We have already seen some parties in Scandinavia use the blockchain for their own internal voting.Whats the future of big corporations like the GEs of the world?The reason we have big corporations is because its more efficient for a company to avoid transaction costs for managing a group of freelance suppliers. As long as its cheaper to do a job internally within a corporation, the job will be done internally. But now the Internet makes it very easy for companies to hire workers who arent on the payroll, workers who are outside the corporation. You can use software to manage them. One way to look at Uber is that it has vaporized managementthe management of the dispatcher is a software program, so job functions have been turned into software. It suggests that we may not need corporations in the future. A company called Ethereum in Canada is trying to replace the entire corporation with software. They are trying to write a software robot program that has all the job functions in the corporation which is kind of a crazy idea, (but it is) actually quite possible.Do big corporations need to drastically change their business models?In industry after industry, corporations move too slowly. They dont go out of business, they just become less relevant because they are not where the growth is. So, if you choose not to participate, you choose not to turn your company into software or replace jobs with software, you wont disappear overnight. A future growth (driver) will emerge and your company will not be part of it. Auto makers and watch makers have a difficult choice to make: they cant stop making cars or watches, thats their business today. At the same time, they see that the future is going to be all about software, and cars or watches will be less important, but they are not good at making software. They certainly arent good enough to compete with Google or other software giants. Should that company embark on a rapid course of action and try to become a software developer or should they partner with Google? If you partner with Google, thats not a great strategy because look at what happened to the smartphone companies. All the companies that manufacture smartphones dont make much money on smartphones: Google literally commoditizes these companies because it sucks the value out of the device and into the network.This is a very difficult challenge for every company that manufactures products: they must become a software company. The question is do they build it themselves, do they buy a company or do they partner with a giant company like Google and become part of their ecosystem? All difficult choices.What do you see emerging as the new sources of competitive advantage in this new world?The companies that understand they have a proprietary data asset will (succeed). What I mean by proprietary data asset is any information asset that grows. In the case of Facebook, thats the social graph. There are many other companies that are mapping the world right now, they are building a location graph. Google has tremendous knowledge about where people are surfing and where they are going, so they have the interest graph. Each company can thereby define a graph.The idea is that each business has at its core, a unit of information, a body of information. When we move business to the network, that information asset should grow if you design your business in the right way. That will emerge as the most important thing for that company over time: an information asset that continues to grow as more people and more devices are connected.Companies that dont rush to embrace often lose their information advantage and someone else comes and steals that from them. So, one way to look at all the struggles that are happening around the world right now, is theres a battle happening for control of data assets. You see this when Google is confronted by the European government about privacy, or when Apple is confronted by the FBI about secrecy and security. Most companies do not understand how to manage or protect their data assets. The successful companies make (data protection) a priority.So, what do you think the Fortune 500 list will look like 20 years from now? What kind of companies will you see there and which ones would be gone?Big automotive makers will be replaced by big companies that provide transportation as a service. Banks will be replaced by companies that provide automatic, secure transactions using the blockchain or something similar Today, the businesses of pharmaceutical companies is a bit like Hollywood: they spend lots of money making drugs and they hope that one becomes a big hit and they make billions of dollars. In the future, you will have customized medical treatment designed for your genome. It will be individualized healthcare. So, pharmaceutical (companies will) shift from mass manufacturing drugs to more of a service delivery model that will be customized to individuals. The companies themselves may stay and remain successful, but they will change into software companies that provide digital services.What other areas will feel the impact?Education will be delivered in software in the future and this bothers a lot of people who feel very sentimental about college education. Its obvious that most people in the world cant afford to go to a private college, most university systems [cannot] take in millions of new students. There has to be an alternative. Software delivery education is the reality today. Its not as good as college education, but remember, these are early days. We have to educate a billion people a year, theres no way we can do that within campus. Robotics will shift so many people out of jobs, everyone will have to retrained. Every worker will have to reskill and retrain consistently. One of the things we will have to do is learn how to work with machines, robots and software automation.If you think about all the really big industries in the worldhealthcare, food supply, transportation, energyall these enormous systems have been designed to serve human beings. That worked well for the last 200 years, but heres the question: if you can vaporize everything, the ultimate expression is to replace the human body by software. Can we replace the human body with software? It seems preposterous, yet there are scientists working right now to model the human brain and replicate the human being in software. Some scientists are working on whole brain emulation. Why? One, there are a lot of places we cant explore: in the depths of the ocean, inside volcanoes, deep inside the earth and also in space. Human beings cant survive in those environments, machines can. If we travel to other stars or planets, the only way thats going to happen is if we can replace the human body, because too much of the weight of spacecraft cargo is life support for human bodies.Is everything about this good?Theres always danger with technology. Technology always makes something that we are familiar with obsolete. You can think of it as super power: it introduces new powers that can be used for good or bad. We shouldnt judge the technology, its really how it is used we should judge, that is a human decision. People are worried about artificial intelligence. This is silly. Its artificial intelligence thats poorly written, (that is used in) the wrong way by human beings, those are things we should be concerned with.Read an unabridged version of the interview on www.foundingfuel.com, published in an exclusive partnership with knowledge.ckgsb.edu.cn/",2016-11-07,CkPEF5bEOBXf98u5jbt98L,"Robert Tercek, futurist and author of the book Vaporized, talks about how digital technology pushes us towards a software-defined society",02:41,No industry is immune from vaporization: Robert Tercek

				The primary issue afflicting the industrys growth is urea price control. The government makes good the production cost through subsidy, but unfortunately payments happen after long delays. Also under-allocation for subsidy requirement in earlier years means the budgeted amounts get exhausted in the first three quarters of the fiscal year.For instance, agricultural inputs manufacturer Coromandel International Ltd has received subsidy payment only till September. As of December, it has subsidy outstanding of Rs.1,582 crore, payment of which may happen only in the next fiscal year.The delay in payments is keeping the interest costs at elevated levels. Data compiled by rating agency Icra Ltd shows that interest expenses of 11 listed companies in the industry more than doubled in the last four years (between 2010-11 and 2014-15). During the period, key return ratios of these companies, such as return on capital employed and return on net worth, roughly halved.Pooling of natural gas and the recent softening of the spot market rates have helped alleviate working capital pressure. As a result, barring a few companies like Gujarat State Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd and Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers Ltd, interest costs at most companies did not rise significantly so far this fiscal year.But that provides no comfort. Prices of raw materials and fertilizers have fallen significantly in international markets, offering scope for subsidy cuts. Analysts expect the government to use this window to retain the overall subsidy amount at current levels and route the cost savings (on NPK grade or complex fertilizers) to clear pending subsidies. NPK is short for nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.This will not help the industry as it will widen the price gap between complex fertilizers and urea. The ideal step will be to rationalize urea prices, which will encourage balanced usage of fertilizers. But will the government bite the bullet? There is a pricing anomaly in the market with urea price being highly subsidized, leading to indiscriminate usage at the cost of NPK fertilizers, K. Ravichandran, senior vice-president and co-head-corporate sector ratings at Icra, said. While the government may resort to reduction in per unit subsidy on NPK nutrients in order to contain subsidy, farm gate price increase on urea remains to be seen with elections round the corner in five states, he added.",2016-02-23,CxQqNbBfv03REevFSeWnOO,"The primary issue afflicting the industrys growth is urea price control

0.91,"New Delhi: After taking over the air (at least in urban India) and the airwavewith sexist advertising that claimed deodorants made men irresistible to womenIndias deodorant makers are now eyeing the perfume market. 
				   
				Deodorants are nothing to be sniffed at. They account for a Rs3,000 crore market in India. Now, the companies behind brands such as Fogg (Vini Cosmetics), Axe (Hindustan Unilever Ltd), and Engage (ITC Ltd), are looking at the branded mass fragrance market. Its a market theirs for the taking. Imported perfumes from luxury brands are usually priced between Rs3,000 and Rs5,000 which the masses cannot afford. Therefore, anybody looking to graduate from a deodorant has no affordable branded option. These brands are building a new category. It is a step towards premiumisation with offer better packaging and a higher price, said Rajat Wahi, partner and head (consumer markets), at consulting firm KPMG in India.Most companies have simply  chosen to extend their deodorant brands to the perfume segment. And, much like with their deodorants, their primary target is young men. Ahmedabad based Vini Cosmetics Ltd, the big daddy of the deodorant business, launched perfume sprays and gift packs last year. While the perfume bottles are priced at Rs499,  the gift packs range from Rs1,000 to Rs2,000. We are investing Rs30 to Rs40 crore in the perfume segment. Since perfume is also an occasional wear product in India we are positioning Fogg perfumes as value for money quality product which can also be gifted on special occasions, said Darshan Patel, founder, Vini Cosmetics. Perfumes contribute less than 10% to the companys overall revenue but Patel is confident that his products will gain a sizeable share in the Rs600 crore perfume market (both organized and unorganized).Like Fogg, HULs popular deodorant brand Axe has also launched premium fine fragrances under Axe Signature Gold range in December. Available in four variants, the Axe perfumes are priced at Rs450. Consumers are becoming more discerning and adding fine fragrances is increasingly becoming a part of their grooming regime. Our perfume range is targeted at young Indian men who are adding fine fragrances as a part of their grooming over and above the current deo usage, said an HUL spokesperson. ITC declined to participate in the story.With a slew of  launches, the companies are also spending big money on advertising although they declined to share their budgets. According to media agencies deodorant brands spend around Rs1, 000 to Rs1,500 crore on television advertising making every year. It is likely some of that money is now going to perfumes. I believe these brands have invested ahead of the curve first for deodorants and now perfumes. This category is heavily skewed towards sports, and news and English entertainment channels as they target young aspirational consumers. We will see a lot more activity in this segment, said Navin Khemka, managing partner, Maxus, a GroupM owned media agency.But the perfumes business may be tougher to crack than the deodorants one. Perfume launches in India havent worked so far.Deo brands have created brand equity by introducing cheaper and casual daily-wear products.

-0.0,"This month marks the 25th anniversary of Indias big bang economic reforms. This newspaper and many others have recounted the turbulent times preceding July 1991. The backdrop was a succession of unstable governments with a rapidly deteriorating macroeconomy and the commencement of the first Gulf war leading to a spurt in oil prices. There was great drama too, with secret airlifting of Indias sovereign gold to pledge as collateral for an emergency foreign loan.
				   
				Even though 1991 is the marker, it is fair to say that reformist thinking was evident even in the mid-1980s. For instance, there were trade reforms (easing of capital goods imports), financial sector reforms (abolition of control of capital issues) and several other smaller reform measures in the administration and running of the public sector. This prior incremental journey has been forgotten because it was overtaken by the tumultuous events of 1990 and 1991.It is also clear by now that support for the reforms process was sprinkled across different ministries. Some well-known bureaucrats (now acclaimed as the architects of Indias reforms) occupied key positions in the economic ministries and the Prime Ministers Office and saw eye-to-eye on what was needed to be done. Their synergy and collective intellect provided the force for the reforms roll-out. The political cover ultimately came from prime minister Narasimha Rao, whose leadership was crucial for the success of the reforms. Rao managed to obtain key cabinet decisions and consensus without the advantage of a mechanism like the group of ministers, used extensively by his successors.By far the biggest reform of 1991 was industrial delicensing. In one swoop the licence-permit raj was dismantled, eliminating the need for permission to set up a new factory, or indeed even to add capacity to an existing factory. It is true that cement decontrol had commenced earlier in 1989, but an order affecting Indias entire industrial sector was 1991s big move. Interestingly, this particular reform was announced by the then industries minister in the forenoon of 24 July 1991the same day that finance minister Manmohan Singh gave his historic budget speech. The next days jubilant headlines missed out that crucial detail, that the licence raj had been demolished by the industries minister, who was none other than the prime minister himself.The dismantling of the suffocating licensing regime was supposed to unleash the industrial sector in a big way. Just like our East Asian peers, we should have seen a jump in the share of manufacturing in national gross domestic product (GDP). Unfortunately this promise was never fulfilled. The share of manufacturing was 16.41% in 1989-90 and is 16.2% in 2015-16 (new GDP series). If anything, it has fallen just a bit. This is a big puzzle. Additionally, even employment in the organized manufacturing sector, especially the public sector, has remained stagnant. It is true that in real terms GDP has quadrupled, which means industrial production too is four times bigger (since its share has remained constant). But it should have galloped and increased its share. The National Manufacturing Policy (NMP) aims to increase the share from the current level to 25% in the next seven years. This seems almost impossible in light of the experience of the past 25 years. The reasons for the stagnation could be many: excessive tax burden, inadequate infrastructure and connectivity, unreliable electricity, non-availability of credit or appropriately skilled labour, lack of research, development or technology adoption and so on.One of the members of the 1991 reforms team and former Reserve Bank of India deputy governor Rakesh Mohan also pointed out another troubling feature. This is manifest in Indias trade balance. If you take out the 6-7% earnings from remittances and software exports, and add 1-2% as healthy current account deficit for a growing economy like India, then our merchandise trade balance is a negative 8-9% of GDP. This is largely the shortage of industrial goods in the country. This gap reflects our inability to service our domestic market in a variety of industrial sectors, from electronics and cellphones to capital goods and machinery. Foreign imports, superior in quality and cheaper (thanks to an overvalued exchange rate), manage to swamp our markets and harness our purchasing power. E-commerce companies are probably sourcing the bulk of their merchandise through imports anyway. According to a Ficci study, the logistics cost component can be as high as 17% of the domestic cost of industrial production. (This includes the ad hoc entry taxes arbitrarily slapped on interstate movement of goods).The NMP document of 2013 already has the blueprint of what needs to be done. Initiatives like Make in India and Mudra Bank loans to small and medium entrepreneurs, the nationwide roll-out of the goods and services tax, easing of power shortagesall will cumulatively give a fillip to industrial production. But as we deal with and solve the problems of yesterday, the challenges of tomorrow are already at our doorstep. This means dealing with the rise of robotics, 3-D printing, vastly diffused and distributed value chains across countries and falling trade barriers thanks to free trade agreements. Raising the share of manufacturing in GDP: this is a hard nut to crack, but crack it we must.Ajit Ranade is chief economist at Aditya Birla Group.

				Lately its been gored by Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries Ltd., whose mobile carrier Jio is literally giving away services and has quickly grabbed 70 million customers.That Vodafone is in talks to combine its Indian business with Idea Cellular Ltd is at least a sign that something can be done to cut the British companys exposure to the country. Vodafone is discussing an all-share deal with Idea that would see it de-consolidate the business in its accounts. ALSO READ | Vodafone confirms Idea merger talks, could create Indias biggest telecom firmCombining the market number two Vodafone with third-placed Idea would create a new market leader ahead of Bharti Airtel Ltd, putting it in a better position to survive Ambanis onslaught. It would have about 390 million customers and about 40% market share by revenue before any antitrust concessions.To try to make the numbers work in an all-share deal, the proposal excludes Vodafones 42% share of an Indian towers company called Indus, worth about $4 billion. That brings the value of the Vodafone mobile business closer to Ideas market capitalization, which jumped more than 25% to $5.2 billion on Monday (from $4.1 billion).If a deal is finalized, Vodafone could then sell down its stake in the merged company over time, hopefully at a better price if its better able to withstand the heat from Jio. There will be synergies too from combining operational and capital spending.ALSO READ | Ideas shares surge on Vodafone merger talks, so do AirtelsPlus Vodafone still has the option of selling its Indus shares to Bharti, which owns 42% of the joint venture, according to Bernsteins Dhananjay Mirchandani.If Vodafone boss Vittorio Colao can engineer those twin moves in India, shareholders would probably accept a reasonable retreat from a painful situation. It would at least burnish the Italian CEOs reputation as a shrewd seller of Vodafone assets. Much of his nine-year tenure has been spent digging up the flags planted by his predecessors in countries from the US to China.ALSO READ | Reliance Jio free offer violates Trai tariff orders, Vodafone tells HCAnd if the combined group manages to put up a decent fight against Ambani, Vodafone could hold on to the stake and its exposure to the fastest growing smartphone market in the world. That said, Indias been a poor investment for the European company. Its business there accounted for about 11% of revenue and 8% of Ebitda in fiscal 2016, but generated no cash flow. Its been a drag on Vodafone shares. Any sign of a potential escape is welcome.

				When the Chinese appliance maker Midea Group announced a bid for the German robotics manufacturer Kuka AG this spring, it seemed like something of an omen. Kuka makes robots that specialize in assembling goods on a factory floorexactly the kind of work that has lifted millions of Chinese out of poverty.After opening up to the world in 1979, China focused on tapping its vast pool of cheap labour. From T-shirts to Christmas ornaments, Chinese manufacturers could undersell the world on most any basic product simply by drafting another migrant farmer into a factory. Investment flooded into Chinese cities. The factories got bigger, better and more advanced. Wages rose, poverty fell, and a middle class emerged and quickly expanded.This was a well-worn path of development. Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea all advanced in much the same way. Today, many developing countries are still counting on this model. The problem is that robotics may fundamentally upend it.Even as global growth slowed, industrial robot sales grew 12% between 2014 and 2015, and have grown fourfold since 2009. As robots get cheaper and better, the advantage of employing a low-skilled labourer starts to fade. Even a lowly sweatshop worker will struggle to compete with a robots productivity, not to mention its low rates of error and other advantages.In other words, where poorer countries could once use their cost advantage to lure manufacturers, now all cost advantages are disappearing in the robotics age. A robot costs the same to employ whether in China, the US or Madagascar. Rich countries are repatriating the production of everything from apparel to electronics. Wal-Mart wants to re-shore the manufacture of $50 billion worth of goods over the next 10 years, relying on increased speed and lower costs as key competitive advantages.The implications of this shift shouldnt be underestimated. The days of international trade growing at near double-digit rates might be over. Trade has historically grown at twice the rate of gross domestic product, but in the past few years it has stagnated, leaving it 15% lower than would be expected, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. It may well have permanently stagnated.In this new reality, development plans for poorer countries will have to be rewritten. But it isnt clear how to do so.One step could be investing in leapfrog technology. Mobile phones are the much-cited example. Thanks to cellular, poorer countries have been able to reap all the advantages that phones brought without the expense of laying land lines. In the digital age, its possible that other technologies could prove similarly transformative. China has become the largest buyer of industrial robots in the hopes that they will help manufacturers make the leap to advanced electronics.But such technology wont do much good without a skilled workforce. A factory of robots will require minimal low-skilled labour, but it will need engineers and computer scientists. Investing in educationnot just coding skills, but the ability to shift seamlessly between products and to create new products faster than competitorswill be critical. Developing countries should also consider programmes to attract skilled labour. China and India, among others, have set up offices to lure home educated workers who have left for richer countries.Finally, countries trying to boost growth could improve governance and domestic policies. If trade is less important, they will need to encourage direct investment flows. If skilled workers are in demand, they will need to relax labour policies to attract educated migrants. And if ideas are more important than ever, they will need to make life easier for entrepreneurs.None of that is easy. And it may not even prove up to the challenge. But the robots are coming, one way or another. Developing countries are the least prepared for that shiftand have the most to lose. BLOOMBERG

0.17,"The goods and services tax (GST) will undoubtedly give India a facelift on the taxation front. Of course, the suspense over the rate at which GST will be levied remains.
				   
				While it is difficult to quantify the impact on various sectors until the government announces the final GST rate, analysts and economists are assuming a standard rate of 17-18%.If that happens, then companies in the manufacturing sector are expected to benefit, while those in the services sector stand to lose.Also read: GST: The road ahead for industry

Of course, even though the bill has been passed in the current session, it will be another couple of years until GST is fully rolled out. As such, its premature to conclude how this reform will impact stock prices in the near term. In any case, there are various other factors that impact stock prices, and while GST is an important reform, analysts are more keen about indicators of the economic recovery.The winners 
1) Automobiles: The auto sector is likely to emerge as a winner from GST implementation, provided the rate is below the total tax incidence for the sector (>27%). GST is expected to lead to lower prices for the end user and thus boost demand. Companies to benefit include Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. Both stocks have outperformed the market so far this fiscal year. Analysts believe some impact of GST could well be priced in at current levels.2) Multiplexes: Multiplex companies pay around 25% of the average revenue per user (average ticket price + food and beverage spends, or F&B per head) as taxes, according to Kotak Institutional Equities. This is in three broad areas(a) entertainment tax on net ticket sales, (b) Value-added tax (VAT) on F&B, and (c) service tax on input costs for which there is no set-off available. No wonder, GST is expected to reduce the tax burden and improve the Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin. Stocks of PVR Ltd and Inox Leisure Ltd have increased 50% and 30%, respectively, so far in FY17, suggesting the shares are factoring in most of the positives. Of course, there are other factors that are driving these shares.3) FMCG: If the GST rate is less than or equal to 18%, then it should be positive for most consumer goods companies, point out analysts at Citigroup. Of course, much depends on which exemptions are retained and which of the current excise benefits are grandfathered. In addition, there will be gains from warehouse rationalization and a better competitive position vis-à-vis unorganized firms. But gains arent expected to be massive and will occur gradually; as such, stocks may not react dramatically just because the GST bill is passed.If cigarettes attract a higher tax incidence under the GST regime, then it will have an adverse impact on companies such as ITC Ltd.4) Logistics: Supply chain management is expected to get a boost and transit time will reduce. Further, interstate trade barriers would reduce and eventually result in better interstate commerce. Consolidation of warehousing facilities is expected. Stocks that may benefit include Container Corp. of India Ltd and Transport Corp. of India Ltd. Citis analysts point out that the better operating environment could lead Gateway Distriparks Ltd to enter the domestic business.5) Cement: The anticipated 18% GST rate is far lower than what cement companies are paying currently, and analysts expect cement makers to pass on the benefits to consumers as demand continues to remain weak. Whether this alone will help revive demand is another matter altogether.6) Retail: The opportunity to set off input tax credit on rent is expected to aid margin expansion. But retail companies are facing other problems. Shoppers Stop Ltds stock has underperformed the benchmark Sensex this year, as underlying demand remains weak and like-to-like sales growth has been lacklustre.Also read: GST reforms: Are companies prepared?

The losers
As mentioned earlier, services-related sectors are expected to be negatively impacted, as they may have to shell out higher taxes than what they are currently paying. Service tax rate is currently at about 15%.1) Telecom: The moderate rise in tax outgo could hit demand and revenues. But there would be a simultaneous set-off of taxes (Cenvat, or central VAT) paid on certain capex inputs. So, the impact would be marginal. But telcos have bigger problems. Data volumes are slowing and the Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd launch can worsen matters.2) Consumer staples and discretionary: Many consumer staples currently have low indirect tax. Hence, GST will be negative for companies in food processing, bakery, edible oil, dairy segments and personal care items. Quick service restaurants too will be adversely impacted. Kotak Institutional Equities sees some impact on Britannia Industries Ltd and ITC.

				The latest scuffle reached a crescendo on Monday after LeEcos chairman and co-founder Jia Yueting admitted last week that his sprawling empire may be struggling just a little. Going by the dictionary definition, sprawling is precisely what his business has been doing.It all started about a dozen years ago when Jia got the idea to start a streaming video service, dubbed LeTV. While its often called the Netflix of China, the moniker should be swappedJias business got going when the US company was still shipping DVDs, so Netflix is more correctly the LeTV of America.But streaming wasnt enough for Jia, so he broadened out to create LeEco. Along with device maker Coolpad, which he also chairs, the plan was to build out an ecosystem that included TVs, tablets and smartphones. And cars, but more on that later. The unsustainability of this enterprise led to his written confession:We blindly sped ahead, and our cash demand ballooned. We got over-extended in our global strategy. At the same time, our capital and resources were in fact limited.:So you have a Chinese technology guy trying to build an ecosystem linking software and content to hardware and devices. Needing money to build out his grand plan, he raises funds since his core business barely generates enough cash to keep things going. Sound familiar?Slinging mud at LeEcoaccording to reports by Bloomberg News, the Beijing Times and othersis Xiaomi founder Lei Jun. Taking to WeChat, Lei cast aspersions on LeEcos debt and its ability to pay. The two traded barbs on social media before the head of LeEcos North American operations, Brian Hui, went on stage at the TechCrunch Beijing forum on Tuesday where he clarified Jias original letter.Its not about running out of money. Its how you can spend your money wisely, Hui told moderator . Which brings me back to the question of how the heck a streaming video company got into high-performance electric cars.The goal of Jias automaking venture, Faraday Future, is to usher in the next generation of premium, hyper-connected electric vehicles in the next few years. To get there its hired 1,400 people and has already burned through 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) in early development. You can turn to its website for an explanation of how this fits in to the LeEco vision, but let me save you some time: It doesnt.Luckily for investors in Jias publicly traded businessesLeshi Internet Information & Technology Corp. and Coolpad Group Ltdmost of the cash burn for these hobby projects hasnt been coming out of company funds. Unluckily, that hasnt stopped them churning through cash of their own accord. Instead, Bloombergs David Ramli writes, Jia uses shares in those companies as collateral against loans going into his moonshot projects.Faraday futures spending so far is $1.5 billion.If one day there is a reckoning, smart investors will be diving deep into the books of Leshi and Coolpad. The same can be said for all number of technology players in China who are rushing headlong into building out ecosystems, relying on continued rounds of funding to hide the fact that their fundamental business might not be sustainable and such synergies are more myth than reality.Mudslingers take note: If Jia has one thing going for him, its the fact that the first step to fixing a problem is admitting that you have one.

What is it? The estimated combined revenue of a proposed merger of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular.Why is it important? The all-share merger will create Indias largest telecom company, larger than the Rs-50,008-crore-earning Bharti Airtel. Debt on both the companies books and likely losses incurred from the tariff-reduction race started by Reliance Jio are being seen as triggers for the move. It looks like a much needed consolidation boost in the 22-circle Indian telecom market, as seen from the stock gains of Indian telecom operators yesterday ranging 8-10% with Idea gaining a record 26%.Tell me more: The merged entry would still have to address, in many markets, the telecom regulators anti-monopoly restrictions of owning no more than 50% of spectrum in a band and 25% of available spectrum in a circle (or geographic market). 1 dayWhat is it? Number of days to go before the RBI-mandated daily ATM withdrawal limit of Rs 10,000 is removed, from February 1.Why is it important? The first sign of reverting to pre-demonetisation days of cash management was made with RBIs circular removing the ATM limit. Two weeks ago, RBI signalled its ease in handling cash by expanding the limit to Rs 10,000 from Rs 4,500. The Rs 24,000-weekly limit on savings-bank withdrawal, however, stays put, but restrictions on current account, cash credit and overdraft accounts will be removed. Tell me more: RBI mentions the savings-bank limit is under consideration for withdrawal in the near future. Banks can use their discretion to set their own operating limits at ATMs as was the practice before old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were withdrawn.42What is it? The number of cases the Income Tax (IT) department registered nationwide under the recently-enforced Benami Transactions Act.Why is it important? Warnings in public advertisements by the IT department against depositing unaccounted old currency in someone elses bank account anonymously are materialising now. The Benami Acts section 24 has been invoked for 87 notices, for attaching bank accounts with crores of rupees of such dubious deposits and an immovable property.Tell me more: These cases, if proven true, would attract a heavy penalty and a rigorous jail-term of a maximum of seven years. 4What is it? The number of new administrators appointed by the Supreme Court to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).Why is it important? The neutral committee headed by former Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), and the current Chairman of Banks Board Bureau, Vinod Rai, will pave the path to reform the embattled BCCI, richest sporting body in India and the most profitable cricket board in the world. The team, with a mix of financial acumen, social perspective and cricketing enthusiasm, is tasked with bringing in accounting rigour and good governance to a body mired in controversies, the latest being its earlier president and secretary sacked on January 3. It would also finalise the Indian Premier Leagues 10th edition besides reporting on the Lodha panel recommendations to the court.Tell me more: The other members are Vikram Limaye, managing director and CEO of IDBI Bank; former Indian womens cricket captain Diana Edulji; and historian and writer Ramchandra Guha.

0.6,"At 62, Max Group founder Analjit Singh is trim and fit and says he is at peace with himselfa state of mind achieved because he doesnt feel the need for habra any more. Translated from Punjabi, that means he is no longer in a tearing hurry, as he was 30 years ago.
				   
				In January, Analjit Singh stepped down as chairman of the group he founded in 1982 and built into a Rs15,000 crore empire, with interests in life insurance; health and allied businesses; and speciality packaging films. In August, the board of Max Life Insurance Co. Ltd signed off on a merger with HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd that will create Indias largest private-sector insurer, with Rs1.1 trillion in assets.The promoters of Max Financialessentially Analjit Singh, his family and related family firmswill hold a 6.5% stake in the merged company and also get a non-compete fee of Rs850 crore. Analjit Singh, who within Max Group is called BAS (short for Bhai Analjit Singh, bhai being an honorific meaning brother), doesnt like being called a promoter, preferring the term sponsor, and seems to have achieved what most business family owners can only think of wistfullya degree of detachment from the business that allows him to take decisions without any emotional baggage.Analjit Singh stands out among the top echelons of business leadership in India for his ability to spot an opportunity like he did with telecom (Singh made Rs561 crore in 1998 by selling his 41% stake in a joint venture with Hutchison Whampoa Ltd)  and insurance and healthcare early on, and  more than that to quit when on top. He ascribes that to foresight and luck; but in reality, it is the mark of a businessman who can read the tea leaves.Analjit Singh, with the reputation of a serial entrepreneur, is also exploring new businesses, including information technology, real estate and education, under Max Ventures and Industries Ltd (MVIL). In an interview at his elegant home on New Delhis tony Abul Kalam Azad Road, Analjit Singh patiently explained his philosophy of life, his current state of mind and how the two relate to his business. Edited excerpts:As a strategic businessman, what are the things you are looking at now? When you look at these opportunities, what excites you the most?
I am not so sure that people in my situation look at entrepreneurial opportunities from purely a new-world perspective, as you pointed out. I think they look at entrepreneurial and future opportunities in rather a traditional way but think of these developments as enablers.What is the traditional way?
It is perspective of the market, key differentiators, compatibility of extensive weaknesses of the individual and the firm to be able to do something like this. So, therefore, in the traditional criteria of finding these opportunities what I meant was market, differentiator, opportunities, regulation...new factor, completely new factor in the decision-making set. The market is over-crowded. Everybody is in the business of over-promising and under-delivering. Capital is no longer a constraint like it was before. To some extent, even technology is no longer a constraint to those people who have some experience and network, you can find the technology. Anything is possible. If you run a world-class airline, technology is available. So, execution is the key. Team is a big factor. Team was never a question in our mind in the past 10-15 years. Today, if I were looking to be in a big business, probably the first question that I will ask apart from market and differentiator is people and team; and then you look at these new-world solutions that you are talking about as how they can become enablers to what they can do.Besides that, this question is not so pertinent to me. I am not super-engaged to be so rattled about what am I going to do and what will be my next big play. It is not top-most of my mind.But you will do new things, right?
I will do new things, but I will say I am not besotted with it anymore. My interest is more to tame myself and tame my mind and tame my life. Do you know this word habra? I have no habra.Were you like that when you did the diversification?
Of course not! Thirty years ago, I was always in a rush.If you forget about the future for now and look at the past 16 years, what are the things that you have picked up?
I dont call myself a promoter. I prefer the word sponsor. I think if a sponsor does not have an affinity with the business, that business unless by luck things take-off, I think that business drags. The affinity of a sponsor to a particular business segment is very important. If (Bharti Airtel Ltd founder) Sunil Mittal did not have an affinity for telecom or for technology, Airtel would not have been what it is today (Indias biggest phone services provider). If I did not have an affinity for being in the businesses of life and, therefore, focus on healthcare and insurance for 15-16 years, it wouldnt have worked.Affinity and focus leads to execution, passion capital, heavy-lifting, good team equals to success. Therefore, you can apply that mantra to anythingold world or new world. What would you call an old-world business? Pick anything. If I say to myself that I am going to leave everything in my life and get into steel and cement, I will find a new way of doing it and I will be successful in 5-7 years. I will find a way because the need for steel and cement is not gone. If you do it as another unit with the traditional way and traditional people, it is a recipe for disaster. So, we have to find an IndiGo (Indias biggest airline) way of getting in steel or cement. IndiGo is a very good example of what I am saying. What is the revolution and reinvention of being in the airline business? People have been in the airline business. They are in the airline business. They will be in the airline business, but most companies fail. So, why is IndiGo successful? Do you think (IndiGo co-founder) Rahul Bhatia goes and fixes the tyres of the plane every day? No. But somewhere between Aditya (Ghosh, IndiGo president) and him, the way they work is set. So, the way we work in insurance and healthcare is set, and everybody then would perform to that tune. Thats because you have affinity. Thats a clear lesson and experience that I can share.Somebody asked me the other day that you are not even now non-executive chairman of your companies. I am of the MVIL (Max Ventures India Ltd) because I am having fun again after 30 years to nurture a new company. Of those, you are of Vodafone.My point there was: to be a non-executive chairman of a company where you are a sponsor is very different from a non-executive chairman of a company where you are not a sponsor. My remake, role, life, expectations, contact, engagement, communication has to be very different if I am a non-executive chairman of a Max company. The deliverables and expectations are different when it comes to  being non-executive chairman of Vodafone. I am not a sponsor. They dont have the same expectation.When do you as a promoter decide that it is time that you should become a sponsor? Let us assume that this second wave of successful diversification that you did were not successful, would you still be saying all this?
So, in a way, it also gets linked to your expectations from future and living with disappointments from your past. Thats in a way what you are saying. I think the honest answer has to be that if the outcomes were not as exciting as they have been, I think, I would have not been as restful in my mind about it as I am appearing right now. I think thats possibly the case, but it also means in my current way of thinking that I would have to work harder at myself to become restful about the disappointments of the past.So, luckily for meand luck is a factor or the blessing that I havethe way I see it from nature and everything else is that these have moved reasonably in tandem. If they had not, the stretch would have been more and one would have to work harder to overcome those disappointments.Is there someone else in your fraternity who has done this really well? Is there a role model?
I wont go to the extent of saying whether I have a role model. I wont say that I am looking at somebody and say look how he did it. But I can tell you who has done it and done it very successfully. He is Vikram Lal (promoter of Eicher Motors Ltd). He is very restful and peaceful as a person. Look what has happened to Eicher. He wanted a particular life for some reason and he went after it and he has got it.I so solidly believe in impermanence that for me to be attached to a business, in this case, life insurance, it is stupid to be attached to it. When life is impermanent then what is this stigma about a business being permanent. Today, when you look at it, the power of this sector in this business is moving to banks. Whether these (insurance) companies are going to be profitable or not will not be because our premiums will get higher. We have the highest persistency (a measure of policy renewals) in the country84%. It is unheard of. The No. 2 company is 63%. So, I cant have more persistency in this business. The banks are now controlling distribution virtually. So, the only way to improve profitability is expense management. So, power shifting from agency to bankers, premiums not going up, expense management, regulators everywhere in this world are tightening the screws on the companies. Solvency margin, shareholder profits, expense allowance and disallowance, participating account versus shareholder account. No. 3 some sort of going back to expense management and market share, some sort of geographies have emerged for different companies. We are very strong in Gujarat; Gujarat is our second or third largest territory. But, more or less, we are more strong in the north and the south than we are in the west or east. HDFC (Life) is more strong in the west and the south than they are in the north. So, if you take the bank they are, you take the opportunity to consolidate and, therefore, cut some unessential costs and you take the link and fourth, product. In our time, we were heavily into protection and savings products. Even today, 80% of our business comes from protection and savings products, not from ULIPs (unit-linked insurance plans) and the like. HDFC is other way around, may be two-third or one-third.These are the four things that I saw writing on the wall about. And I have to tell you that when as a sponsor, among the 23 or 24 companies that are in life (insurance), if you take the balance sheet of the sponsor, we must be one of the smallest, I think. So from being in that position to sitting at No.3 of 23-24 with all the names you know sitting below us, you can get spoilt; and then, one fine day, because of these four factors, nobody gives you notice of failure in life like you never get notice of death.The same is in this business, some things just happen, and they change and then all of a sudden you say, oh shit what has happened?Six months ago, we were like this. And you come from 3 to 6 to 8 to 9. I dont want to take that chance; but then, it will go back to the question you asked me that if at the end of all this it was not good, would you have felt the same thing and I would have said no and I would have to start again, building again. I can see it happening, but my responsibility is I must not let it happen. Here is my opportunity that God has sent to me, I must take it.But you do take impulsive decisions? You do take decisions on the basis of your instinct?
Of course, you do.In South Africa, for instance.
Of course, I did. But hang on, yes and no. The impulsive decision that was taken about South Africa was not for business. The impulsive decision was to want to be there and enjoy the location. Like I may have a home. So, that was the impulsive decision. When it started to go away from becoming a holiday home or retreat to business, then I am very conscious, not impulsive. So, today that operation is being run exactly like any company of the Max group, with a board, people, CEOs, accountability, targets, budgets, matrix and data.Is it a part of the Max group?
No, no, private. Max has nothing to do with it.Could you elaborate a little bit, what is it about?
It is about hospitality, lifestyle, hotels, rooms, agriculture, plums, wines, almonds, wine-making, selling wines, three hotels, beer. We have a similar property in the UK. The first property is Linthwaite (Lake District Hotel, Linthwaite House), which is in the UK. So, we will grow in the UK. We have just acquired it in April. On 25 April, we took over.Whats the vision for it?
I have always wanted to be in the hospitality business. When I started vision 2000 of Max, I picked four areas: it was insurance, healthcare, education and hospitality. When we got cracking on insurance and healthcare, we did not have five rupees, or five minutes or five calories of energy to invest in anything other than insurance and healthcare; so we left it at that. In a way, Antara (homes for senior citizens) and remotely Vana (wellness resort) were born out of this idea of hospitality. And now, I am starting my life in education. Education is one of them, but it is a little too premature to talk about. In education, we have started some work. Are we engaged in it? Yes, but what are we going do, I dont know. But we have decided to be in that sector, so I dont know whether its 0 to 11 or KG to 16.Is someone thinking about this?
Yes. Very much. But just now, in August, its too soon for me to say whether its going to be Boeing or Airbus or north only or all India or only abroad... But it will be top three. I just like that expression of top three. And it should be, otherwise whats the point?Why are you interested in the real estate business?
I have a bit of khurak (itch) here. Actually, my grandfather was in the contracting business. That was my great grandfathers business in Pakistan. The bhai family were contractors. They built the road from India to Burma as a case in point. So, even now, you go to Lahore and all, and you will see a lot of buildings built by them. People in the street remember them as a family. So, I have a khurak for civil, real estate and stuff. I like land. I like construction, I like design. I like building. Every time the economy is on the cusp, and every time we talk about India being the next big thing... there are sections which are being talked about such as manufacturing, real estate, education... Do you see the economy like that?
I do and on the manufacturing side, I cant tell you anything today. I hope I can tell you in 60 days. We will, if all goes well, we will be in that space, in the prime ministers central part of his vision... Make in India. I will give you a beautiful project, if it succeeds, I dont know, I cant tell you today, we are working on it. I cant tell you what it is today. But if it succeeds, Mr. (Narendra) Modi will use this as an example of Make in India.Manufacturing is huge right? Its like a huge umbrella.
Our manufacturing space is only in one sector, which is polymers area. I am talking about that area, I am not talking about planes or furniture or phones or cars. Lets see. See, we never looked at anything else all these years. Thats why I coined this expression that I will look now at WWOBwider world of business. Education is that. Differentiated real estate is that. Investing is that. Everybody did investment. Other than financial services companies, people didnt use investing as a business. And you dont have to be financial investor to invest. So, investing will be a vertical of ours. Could be in shoes, could be in water, could be in plants.Do you see growth opportunities in the healthcare business?
Huge growth opportunities. Healthcare, if done and executed right. But most people will not be able to get it right. Most people will try and fail because of the population in our country, because of a very small percentage of it that can actually access healthcare, because of technology in this sector.Answer to your question is Alpha. But we worked 10-15 years to create that foundation. In Saket we will build the single largest hospital in Asia. But why we have not broken the ground there because we are not designing the hospital that is not so difficult to do. We are designing an ecosystem around Saket with a world class company who is doing all the planning and master planning for us.Which is this company?
HKS Architects. So we would change the shape of that part of Saket.So its a complete revamp?

0.57,"Investors in Aditya Birla Nuvo Ltd had been hounding it with one questionwhen will the financial services business be demerged and listed as a separate entity? The company would typically dismiss this, saying some of these businesses were still small and needed the backing of a large firm such as Nuvo. 
				   
				The company has now decided to demerge the financial services business and list it. But instead of ending up with a leaner corporate structure, the Aditya Birla Group has made things far more complicated, by merging Nuvo with Grasim Industries Ltd. Besides, the complicated restructuring will increase the promoter groups stake in the cash cow cement business and decrease its ownership of the cash guzzling telecom business.Before the demerger, Nuvo will be merged into Grasim, which means investors of both companies will be saddled with a myriad of new businesses they earlier did not have any exposure to. The groups chairman, Kumar Mangalam Birla, said in a press conference that the merger, along with the demerger, will create value for shareholders. But on the contrary, with an increasing number of businesses ending up under one holding company, value could get destroyed. The only silver lining for existing shareholders is a holding in the to-be-listed financial services firm. The new behemoth that arises out of the merger will have so many diverse interests, most investors are likely to shun it. After all, each of the interesting parts of these businesses will be separately listedUltraTech Cement Ltd for the cement business, Idea Cellular Ltd for the telecom business and finally the newly listed financial services business. Investors may steer clear of a firm where a holding company discount is applied to so many large businesses.For perspective, Grasims 60.25% stake in UltraTech Cement itself is valued at less than 70% of its market value because of the holding company discount. Until now, for Grasim shareholders, there was at least an arbitrage opportunity, which would come into play when share prices fell vis-à-vis UltraTech Cements share price. In Nuvos case, some investors found the play on the financial services story compelling. There are hardly any reasons to invest in the merged company, certainly not after the financial services firm lists. Interestingly enough, the promoter holding in Grasim will rise from 31.3% to around 38.8% post the restructuring. Their ownership in the financial services and telecom businesses will decline. Minority shareholders of Grasim, on the other hand, have to settle for a lower stake in the cement business and take on exposure to the telecom and financial services business. Since the promoter group is considered the most informed investor, a natural question these investors will have is, Why should we do the opposite of what the promoters are doing? Nuvos shareholders, a far smaller piece in the whole puzzle in terms of their value of shareholding, get to enjoy the same ride as the promoters. But again, they too end up with an investment in a holding company.

0.17,"Over a decade ago, one of the doyens of Indian business journalism had written an article, Tale of two companies, comparing two packaged consumer goods makersHindustan Lever Ltd (still not Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) then) and ITC Ltd. Since then much soap and detergent have been washed down the Hooghly and Arabian Seaas indeed millions of puffs have been blown through human chimneys. While HUL has regained its old act by re-engineering itself, ITC has got its new act together by reinventing itself. 
				   
				Till the early 1990s, the punch line of all Hindustan Lever chairmen used to be we are an Indian company whose largest shareholder happens to be a multinational. ITC, on the other hand, used to be less apologetic about its BAT Plc. parentage. Following the eminently forgettable K.L. Chugh era, when Y.C. Deveshwar mounted the saddle, in a corporate coup of sorts with the backing of institutional shareholders, he decisively cut off the umbilical chord and embarked on a mission to establish ITCs Indian credentials with a vengeance. At the same time, with liberalization of the Indian economy, the new generation chairmen of Lever over time shed their trademark khadi silk bush-shirts in favour of bespoke suits when traversing the power corridors of Delhi. However, this piece is not about comparing the two companies but trace the evolution of ITC as an Indian consumer products giant. It is easy to surmise why Ajit Haksarthe last of the corporate Mohicansventured into hotels. It was partly to hedge against the possibility of curbs on the tobacco business and also as a safe haven for the surplus funds of the mother business that could be easily encashed anytime by selling the brand or the real estate. It is to Haksar and ITCs credit that they nurtured Welcomgroup for a long time before it became truly profitable. Printing and packaging (where Deveshwar first cut his teeth) and paper boards were but logical vertical integration.Similarly, one would believe the lifestyle and apparel business was started to secure the Wills franchise. But the real serious diversification was kicked off with ITCs plunge into the foods businesswhich arose both out of necessity and opportunity. Subsequently, it naturally extended to pure consumer products play.The story of ITCs transformation is one of turning a proverbial threat into an opportunity. As the time-worn cliché goescigarettes is a dying industry in more senses than one. With the intervention of World Health Organization and a judiciary increasingly sensitive to the hazards of tobacco consumption, the tobacco industry has had to brace itself for a premature sunset like its consumers (smokers). Simultaneously, there was a need to divert public attention from corporate governance and health (tobacco) to being a socially-responsible organization. This, one would suspect, was the genesis of a we also make cigarettes strategy.The ban on cigarette advertising came as a blessing in disguise as it left ITC flush with cash. Not having a majority foreign shareholding allowed it to enter the food sectorthen reserved for domestic players (except those such as Nestle SA, GlaxoSmithKline PLC and a few otherswho enjoyed the benefits of a grandfather clause). Food was largely an open field with no organized pan-India player barring Britannia Industries Ltd. From biscuits, atta, ready-to-cook or heat meals, it has seamlessly moved to instant noodles, juices and now, one hears, coffee is in the pipeline.For a cigarette manufacturer with low technology and little product innovation except in packaging perhaps, ITCs most remarkable achievement was in learning the ropes of an entirely different supply chain and gaining mastery of a new product category, not just in terms of marketing but product development and innovation. Equally challenging was building a network whichcontrary to popular beliefhad little in common with the cigarette retail channel.The evolution into personal care was even more interesting because here it had to contend with a giant like Unilever with an 80-year legacy in India, international brands and world-class research and development. Making soaps, body-wash and shampoo brands is as different as paneer is from talcum powder. Globally, too, it is rare for companies to be equally successful in both food and packaged consumer products. Neither Unilever nor Procter & Gamble Co. can really be considered to have handled both businesses with the same level of success while traditional food makers like Nestle and General Foods Corp. have by and large stuck to their knitting.However, ITCs real success lies in achieving this transformation with existing, home-grown talent with very little (or practically no) lateral hires at senior levels. ITC remains one of the few large companies that still believes in providing long-term careers to its employees. It is a key differentiator in a fast-changing corporate world where turnover and velocity are the current flavours of human resources management. Changing the corporate DNA and culture is no mean task. If an organization has to reinvent itself so have to its leaders. This is where Deveshwar scores above many of our present day corporate icons. Arguably, he had an extended stay at the top. But Deveshwar leaves behind a new ITC for the next generation.In contrast, the much-hyped Project Millennium of Leverriding on which many careers were madelost steam. Among close to a dozen business ideas incubatedjust about one (water, that too in a modified form) has survived the genetic implant.It was generous of Deveshwar to praise Amul and Patanjali in his speech. The jury on the latter is still out. But, what it does underscore is the rapidly shrinking ramp-up time. What took Unilever 60 years to achieve, Amul did in 40 and ITC in 20. Now, Patanjali has managed to scale up in less than five. A fascinating battle lies ahead between the global giants and the emerging swadeshi challengers.Sandip Ghose is a marketer, blogger and writer.

-0.42,"New Delhi: The internet is free and open, or so we like to believe. In recent years, a number of countries have blocked particular applications, shutdown specific digital services, turned off mobile telecommunications services, or disrupted the entire internet. 
				   
				In  a recent paper Internet shutdowns cost countries $2.4 billion last year by Brookings Institution, a non-profit public policy organization, author Darrel M. West analyses the economic impact of temporary internet shutdowns. West examines 81 short-term shutdowns in 19 countries over the past year and estimates their impact on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of those nations. Based upon this analysis, West finds that between 1 July 2015 and 30 June 2016, internet shutdowns cost at least $2.4 billion in GDP globally.India faces the highest economic loss at $968 million followed by  $465 million loss in Saudi Arabia, Morocco ($320 million) , Iraq ($209 million), the Republic of the Congo ($72 million) , Pakistan ($69 million), Syria ($48 million), and Turkey ($35 million), among other places. These are conservative estimates that consider only reductions in economic activity and do not account for tax losses or drops in investor, business, and consumer confidence.West argues in the paper that internet disruptions are creating significant detrimental impacts on economic activity in a number of nations around the world. He says: As the digital economy expands, it will become even more expensive for nations to shut down the internet. Without coordinated action by the international community, this damage is likely to accelerate in the future and further weaken global economic development.Internet disruptions over the past yearWest finds that there is a rising trend of governments disrupting the internet and quotes a study by University of Washington researchers who identified 606 occasions between 1995 and the first part of 2011 where 99 different governments deliberately interfered with the normal operation of the internet.To ascertain the number of times disruptions have happened in the past year, West collected cases from internet searches, English-based news coverage, and lists compiled by non-profit organizations that track such disruptions. Overall, he cites  81 disruptions in 19 countries during this period. This includes 22 in India, Iraq (22), non-ISIS controlled parts of Syria (8), Pakistan (6), Turkey (3), and 2 each in Bangladesh, Brazil, North Korea, the Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and Vietnam, among other places.West also identified six categories of disruptions: national internet, sub-national internet, national mobile internet, sub-national mobile internet, national app/service, and sub-national app/service (including VoIP). The impact on Gross Domestic ProductOverall, these disruptions cost countries a total of at least $2.4 billion over the past year, with impact ranging the highest in India at  $968 million. These disruptions lasted 753 days in total across all countries. West also cites a number of notable internet disruptions. One took place in Saudi Arabia in May 2016. Citing economic damage to telecommunications providers, the government blocked functionality of a number of apps related to VoIP, texting, and instant messaging; those impacted included WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Skype, among others. The move cost the country $465 million in GDP. India, for instance, shut down mobile internet services in Rohtak on February 19, 2016 in response to street demonstrations in Rohtak and Jhajjar. The disruption lasted more than a week and cost $190 million. Law enforcement officials explained that this has been done so that rumours are not spread as this could lead to the situation getting out of hand.  In Brazil, a local judge ordered telecommunications companies to block access to WhatsApp on May 2, 2016 following an earlier shutdown in December 2015. The May shutdown blocked access to the predominant communications service across the country for a day and cost the Brazilian economy $39 million. West concludes by saying that government officials in many countries around the world appear increasingly comfortable blocking access to online services and apps, despite the significant economic and social damage that internet service disruptions bringto their countries. Whether their ostensible motivations are public security or political self-preservation, government officials should understand the wide-ranging and destructive consequences of these moves. Shutting down accessto popular services or to the whole interneteven for a short period of timeundermines economic growth, puts lives in jeopardy, separates people from friends and family, and erodes confidence in the governments that takesuch drastic and ill-advised steps. West said in an email interaction:Government leaders need to understand they shoot their economies in the foot when they disrupt the internet. Shutdowns harm small and large businesses and lead to big economies losses. As the digital economy grows, these costs will accelerate.",2016-10-14,HBa7uLVF6xO7mKbAIN9X5L,"Internet shutdowns, caused due to six categories of disruptions, cost about $2.4 billion in GDP globally between 1 July 2015 and 30 June 2016, says Brookings Institution ",14:21,How much does internet shutdown cost India?

0.21,"New York: Four of the best professional poker players in the world spent most of January holed up at the Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh, losing. Theyd show up before 11 am, wearing sweatpants and stylish sneakers, and sit down in front of computer screens. Each of them was supposed to play 1,500 hands of heads-up no limit Texas Hold Em online before they could go back to the hotel for the night. This often meant working past 10 pm. Over the course of the day, Starbucks cups and water bottles piled up next to the playerss keyboards. Chipotle bags lay at their feet. 
				   
				Every time one of the players made a move, the action was transmitted to a computer server sitting eight kilometers away at Carnegie Mellon University. From there, a signal would travel another 19 kms to their opponent, a piece of software called Libratus running at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center in Monroeville, a nearby suburb. Libratus played eight hands at oncetwo against each opponent. It moved at a deliberate pace, slow enough to drive Jason Les, one of its human opponents, a bit mad. It makes the days longer, said Les, an earnest, athletic-looking man who seemed eager to take a few minutes off one afternoon last week. Waiting should not affect me whatsoever, but sometimes youre just like, OK, is this going to be over yet? Libratus, of course, never needs a break. Its different from human players in other ways, too. People tend to think longer when theres more money at stake. The computer plays most slowly on small pots, a result of having to scroll through all the additional possibilities that come from having more chips remaining in its hand. Libratus also tends to make huge, sudden wagers, violating standard betting conventions by throwing its money into the pot in irregular amounts and at odd intervals.Coming from a human player, behaviour like this would be irritating, reckless and, over the long run, expensive. But Libratuss main attribute as a poker player is that its inhumanly good. When the 20-day tournament at Rivers came to an end Monday, the humans had lost $1.8 million. (They didnt actually have to pony up the cash; money serves as the way of keeping score in poker.) Tuomas Sandholm and Noam Brown, the computer scientists at Carnegie Mellon who built Libratus, celebrated the win as the first time that a computer has beaten top poker players at a variant of unlimited Texas holdem, the worlds most prominent poker game. Experts in artificial intelligence have always used games as a way to develop and test their creations. Computers have surpassed the best human players at chess, checkers, backgammon, and go. Poker is a distinct challenge because of the element of chance, and because the players dont know what cards their opponents are holding. So-called imperfect information games require the sort of human intelligencelike deceiving an opponent and sensing when shes deceiving you that computers lack.No limit holdem is the game you see in tournaments, and it has the reputation of being more of an art than a science, said Adam Kucharski, author of The Perfect Bet: How Science and Math Are Taking the Luck Out of Gambling. There was the idea that this game would be safer for much longer from these machines. That idea has been blown up in recent weeks. In early January, researchers at the University of Alberta released a paper based on a contest in which their own AI, named DeepStack, beat 11 professional poker players.Whether DeepStack beat Libratus to the punch is a matter of debate. Sandholm said that the pros who played against his bot were better than those DeepStack defeated. Michael Bowling, the head of the University of Albertas computer program, conceded this point. But he questioned whether humans are at their best when playing continuously for nearly a month. Both men agree that poker AI has just crossed a significant threshold. For them this has little to do with poker itself. Holdem is just a way to find sparring partners for their artificial intelligence programs, and the gains made by game-playing bots will filter back into applications like cybersecurity. This is the main benchmark the community has settled on, but these algorithms are not for poker, said Sandholm, who was once one of the worlds top-ranked windsurfers and kind of looks like Bill Gates. Theyre general purpose.ALSO READ | Work in an automated futureDeepStack and Libratus play an unusual version of poker. The computers are matched up against a single opponent, as opposed to a group of players. The number of chips each player holds is reset after every hand, eliminating the complicated psychological game through which players with more chips intimidate poorer players by forcing them to make big bets. Eric Hollreiser, a spokesman for Amaya Inc., the worlds largest online poker company, said this limits any threat that AI poses to the poker industry. While on a functional hand-by-hand basis it mimics poker play, it is far, far removed from the reality of what happens at tables, he said. There are other experiments going on in less controlled environments. Poker bots have been playing in online cash games for nearly as long as scientists have been building them in labs. Theyve historically played low-stakes games and havent been considered very skillful. But bots are spreading into higher-stakes contests, said Chris Grove, a gambling industry analyst and the publisher of Online Poker Report. If youre an online poker operator, this is probably your number one fraud concern, and probably by a pretty wide margin, he said. The poker industry and the academic poker world have been quietly collaborating for years. Everyone involved remains sketchy on the details. But both the people building commercial bots and those trying to combat them watch the academic work closely. Several of Bowlings former students have gone on to work for online poker companies. At least one has sold bots used to play online. ALSO READ | Five technology trends to watch out for in 2017Of course a lot of gambling people are worried that it may kill internet gambling for money, because people are worried that bots are going to be so good that theyre going to be had, said Sandholm. That could happen, but thats not really my concern. In poker slang, a computer program that can do your playing for you is called a dream machine. Participants in online forums swap notes about when suspicious activity might indicate robotic play  or war stories about how theyve made their own bots. Amaya, which operates online poker operations PokerStars and Full Tilt, employs 70 people to combat this kind of fraud. PokerStars employees call players and ask them to describe their strategies on certain hands. The company has also sent e-mails to players requiring them to make videos in which users rotate the camera 360 degrees to show their surroundings, then play for over an hour with their hands and keyboards fully visible. Bots dont have to be wildly skilled at poker to be profitable for their operatorsand dangerous to the industry. A program that can make modest profits by exploiting mediocre players may be worth it. But Darse Billings, the head of poker strategy at Gamesys, the UK-based online gaming company, said dream machines and academic AIs are using different techniques and trying to solve fundamentally different challenges. Beating bad players isnt just a simplified version of beating elite players. Its a completely separate problem. More than anyone, Billings understands both poker worlds. He studied the game while getting a masters degree in computer science in the 1990s, then became a professional poker player to pay off his student loans. Several years later he went back to school to work with Jonathan Schaeffer, a computer scientist at the University of Alberta best known for writing software that could play checkers perfectly. Billings convinced Schaeffer to focus on poker next. To solve checkers, Schaeffer had used a method that essentially attempted to calculate the best move in any relevant situation, without considering what had happened up to that point. But it didnt make sense to think about each move as an isolated problem in a game like poker, where luck is involved and not everyone has access to all the relevant information. The University of Alberta researchers set out to develop an overall strategy. This entailed looking for what is known in game theory as a Nash equilibriuman approach for playing a two-person game that cannot lose over the long run regardless of what ones opponent does to respond. ALSO READ | How bots will shape the future of workA Nash equilibrium isnt a single ideal style of play. The key to an equilibrium strategy in poker is to play the strongest potential hands while remaining unpredictable. When you bet your strong hands, there needs to be some doubt, said Billings. The team developed a cautious AI, dubbed Mr. Pink, and a very aggressive one, named Agent Orange. Its hard to talk about a computer program that does this without sounding like youre talking about something that to actual thinks. The equilibrium approach drew the University of Albertas Bowling, whose specialty is game theory, to poker in 2003. Sandholm, who sat on Bowlings thesis committee at Carnegie Mellon, turned to poker the following year, and has taken on a similar approach. Sandholm and Bowling started the Annual Computer Poker Competition together in 2006, and have periodically played against top human players. Even as they compete, the labs have been gleaning insights from one anothers research ever since.Both programs took big steps toward the endgame in the last several years. In January 2015, Bowlings team published a paper showing how it had solved heads-up limit holdem, a two-person poker game that is simpler than no-limit holdem because of restrictions on how players can bet. Sandholm and Brown, a Ph.D. student who has been working with him on poker AI for the last five years, held their first Brains v. AI competition against top humans at Rivers Casino several months later. Their bot, named Claudico, lost $732,000 over 80,000 hands played against four professional players. Sandholm said the match was close enough to call a draw, a claim that at least one player disputed. Sandholm and Brown say there are several general areas their AI has improved since then. Claudico played well in the early stages, but tended to make mistakes at the end of hands. It bluffed at the wrong moments, and had trouble accounting for how the odds of the game changed based on the cards that it knew had been removed from the deck. In its simplest form, this is the reasoning that says that if there are two kings on the table and you have two kings, your opponent cant have any. Libratus has improved in all those areas. Its creators remain coy on some other areas, like specifically how it chooses to make adjustments based on what it learns over the course of a day of play.All the details of Libratus will eventually be revealed when its creators publish their findings. This kind of academic work tends to filter into real-world poker in various ways. The Annual Computer Poker Competitions have included entrants that also play in cash games, according to Brown. Bowling said his research papers are popular on message boards for people building bots. Theres this whole separate group of people reading these papers and trying to understand them, he said.Billings joined the poker industry in 2008. Hes one of a handful of people who did so after leaving the University of Albertas program. Most of them have been hired by companies that run gaming platforms. Richard Gibson struck out on his own, starting a company called Robot Shark Gaming that built AI programs for studying and playing strategic games, and then a fantasy sports company called SportsBid. Gibson was finishing up a Ph.D. in 2013 when a group of professional players approached him, offering to pay for software they could use in training. Gibson was only given one persons name, never met any of his clients in person, and isnt sure how many people were in the group. Even though they werent using it to gamble online, there was a stigma, he said.Gibson built multiple programs, and said he designed the software to demonstrate the effectiveness of various strategies; it couldnt play on its own. In his most lucrative year, Gibson made about $100,000 on that project, and his clients paid another $20,000 to $30,000 in fees related to the computing power it took to run the software. The anonymous pros werent Gibsons only clients. In one case, he said someone paid him tens of thousands of dollars to spend about six months building a lightweight poker bot. He didnt ask much about how it would be usedhe didnt want to knowbut the design pointed to a specific application. My clients wanted a standalone thing they could load onto their laptop, he said. I imagine theyre trying to play online with them. At the end of each night at Rivers, Les and his fellow poker pros would order takeout and pore over data about the days action in search of Libratuss weaknesses. Early in the month, they woke up each morning optimistic that they had some new tricks. There were specific exploits we identified in the first few days, said Les. We attacked them and attacked them, and now theyre gone. Libratus was also making adjustments. During the day, the program split its computing power between playing the hands in front of it and what Sandholm described as continuous strategy improvement. At night, the program focused entirely on strategy, using 600 nodes of the supercomputer, the equivalent of about 3,330 high-end Macbooks working in tandem. In poker, as in other games that AI has played at the top levels, computers have developed strategies that filter back to human players. Les said hes trying to figure out how to adapt some of Libratuss irregular betting behaviour to his own game. Its hard. We just simply do not have the mental capacity to do it, he said. If humans have reached the point at which their computer opponents are just too good for them, labs like the ones that Sandholm and Bowling run are facing almost the opposite problem. Head-to-head matches against professionals are one thing. But theres no clear path to turn Libratus and DeepStack into players that could be confident of beating a group of flawed humans. Thats because the equilibrium strategy that the AIs use fall apart in multiplayer games, when the point isnt to play perfectly but to identify and exploit the shortcomings in other peoples games. Several years ago Bowling did an experiment where three bots played against one another. Two of them used his labss closest approximation to perfect play; the third one was programmed to raise recklessly. At the end of the game, the dumbest bot lost a small amount of money. One of the perfect players won big, but the other one lost its shirt. Thats really the hard part. How do you reason about these games if you know youre going to sit down with human players or other programs that arent very good? said Bowling. Youre going to have to be prepared for that.  Bloomberg",2017-01-31,HeRzMG8UNSc8zRMAgds00K,Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence research raise questions about the threat that bots pose to the online gambling industry,18:36,"A computer just beat poker professionals, achieving a major AI milestone"

				A significant portion of the credit for making space cool again goes to the disruption of the space industry over the last few years by private enterprise. The poster boy of this bright new space is, of course, Elon Musk and SpaceX. From slashing the cost of launches by landing the first stages of rockets through putting together plans to colonize Mars, he has already shown he has what it takes to define space for tomorrow. Over the years, national space agencies like Nasa, Isro, Roscosmos, CNSA, Jaxa and ESA have been at the forefront of pushing humanity into space. That is changing.There are parallels to where space is now and where the Internet was a few decades back. For many years, the Internet remained a project inside the US government establishment. I dont need to expand on how the opening up of the Internet to entrepreneurs changed the world. Space is at a similar juncture where private enterprise is starting to make its presence felt. The next decade is when much of this shift will be under way. The attraction of space tourism has been central to the coverage and narrative that has followed private enterprise in the field. That is only natural, given the presence of media-friendly figures like Virgin Groups Richard Branson working on space tourism projects. But the real innovation driven by private enterprise is going to be in other, less glamorous but equally fascinating areas. Think small satellites, for instance. As The Economist points out, advancements in smartphones and other consumer electronics provide a wealth of ready-made technologies that can enable a CubeSat (a type of nano satellite) to perform many of the functions of a satellite a hundred times heavier and much larger, but at substantially less cost. That will revolutionize everything from weather prediction to remote sensing to telecommunications, and help bring the power of technology to billions around the world in a much deeper and more meaningful way.Then there is the opportunity to develop technology that will satiate human appetite for everything from energy to precious metals. Globally, companies like Deep Space Industries have been talking up asteroid mining. An article in the technology publication New Atlas says, Studies indicate that an asteroid 1,000 metres (3,280 ft) across could yield about 100,000 tonnes of platinumwhich already has miners in South Africa worried because we only mine a measly 130 tonnes of the metal on Earth each year.Helium 3 is another resource which can change how mankind powers itself. The Moon has rich deposits of the isotope, which is hard to find on Earth. If technology is developed to use this isotope for nuclear fusion, the amount of Helium 3 on the Moonaccording to Prof. Ouyang Ziyuan, the chief scientist of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program (Clep)can solve humanitys energy demand for around 10,000 years at least. If finding ways to make that happen isnt a challenge that entrepreneurs must rise up to, what is?While the idea of space-based business evolves, India is in the middle of a revolution as well. A new generation of entrepreneurs is backing itself to change the way we live and do business. Our opportunity in space business does not start and end with cost arbitrage for foreign companies. Our obvious cost advantages must be leveraged as a catalyst to innovate in everything from designing, developing and launching smaller satellites to making bets that can make the difference in mankinds quest for newer energy sources. We at TeamIndus are happy to start the conversation, and we hope many more Indian entrepreneurs will join us on this journey.Rahul Narayan is co-founder and fleet commander of Team Indus, an aerospace research start-up, and the only Indian team competing for the $30-million Google Lunar XPRIZEThis is part of a series of articles in Mints 10th anniversary special issue that look at India 10 years from now.

1.0,"Seattle: Steve Ballmer is pretty bummed out about the election. A self-proclaimed numbers guy, Ballmer said the truth is getting lost in the political rhetoric, and he wants to arm citizens with data to defend against lies by the campaigns. Nobody seems to care about the facts, he said.
				   
				When not jumping around on the sidelines of Los Angeles Clippers games, the former Microsoft Corp. chief executive officer (CEO) has been spending his retirement on the inside of an Excel spreadsheet. Ballmer and a team of about 25 data geeks have been poring over more than three decades of government documents to create a comprehensive accounting of US spending. The goal is to treat the nation like a company and create what Ballmer describes as a 10-K for the government, like the one publicly traded businesses are required to file with regulators each year.Ballmers project, called USAFacts, exists in the form of hundreds of Excel files and 385 PowerPoint slides, many of which require a magnifying glass to read. While the complete report wont be ready in time for Election Day, hes using the research as the basis for a class he teaches at Stanford University. His group of 19 sophomores are getting a peek at what Ballmer plans to publish early next year in the form of a 10-K filing, investor presentations, charts, graphics and a dedicated website.Mary Meeker, a partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, undertook a similar effort called USA Inc. that Bloomberg Businessweek published in 2011. Two years ago, President Obama signed the Data Act, designed to make federal spending information more accessible, while OpenGov and other venture-backed start-ups have sprung up with the goal of increasing transparency. While any effort toward greater visibility is a good thing, the government shouldnt be analyzed in the same way as a business in some cases, said Alex Howard, a senior analyst at the Sunlight Foundation, an advocacy group for government openness who hasnt seen Ballmers report.In Ballmers worldview, data trumps all. I just think its important if you are going to make your case, for you to make your case in the context of numbers, Ballmer said at his office in Bellevue, Washington. Here are the numbers. You dont have to be a rocket scientist. You dont have to be an economist. You decide what you believe. And when things come up that you need to vote on, you need to opine on, youll have the view of a citizen thats informed by facts.A childhood veteran of math camp with an undergraduate degree in mathematics and economics from Harvard University, Ballmer tends to mentally organize his life into rows and columns. He has a superhuman memory for numbers that would impress, and sometimes terrify, his lieutenants at Microsoft. Hed frequently ask detailed questions about a managers business unit, sometimes reciting metrics off the top of his head that no one else in the room knew. Steve sees the world as an Excel spreadsheet, said Kevin Turner, who Ballmer hired as Microsoft chief operating officer in 2005 and is now CEO at financial firm Citadel Securities.Ballmers obsession with government data originated from a disagreement with his wife. Almost three years ago, Connie Ballmer told her newly retired husband that he should focus more on philanthropy. His wife has dedicated herself to child welfare and other causes, and theres plenty left to give: Ballmers estimated net worth is $25.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. I said, Eh, why do you worry about it so much? Ballmer said. At the end of the day, the biggest philanthropy in the US is the government. So as long as we pay our taxes, were doing our part.It was an unusual argument to make, and as with many Ballmer debates, it turned into a research exercise. He scoured the web for a summary of government spending at all levels. He started with Bing and then tried Google. Neither had what he was looking for. So he decided to build it.Working with data, design and academic experts at Stanford and in the Seattle area, Ballmer runs the project from the 20th floor of a high-rise overlooking Lake Washington. One challenge they faced early on was figuring out how to divide the government into business units. After several failed approaches, a staffer suggested a look through the Constitution. The Constitution! Ballmer recalled, suddenly speaking many decibels louder as he got up to diagram the segments on a massive Microsoft Surface Hub touchscreen computer. Its the perfect way!USAFacts breaks down government operations into four main segments based on the preamble to the Constitution. For establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, they chose police, workplace safety and child welfare; another includes military, defence, foreign affairs and immigration; the third has the economy and caring for the poor; and in the last, civil rights, environmental sustainability and education. The 10-K has a section on risk factors, an essential part of public company filings. It includes war, interest rate hikes, civil unrest and climate change. The draft report also talks about America Corp.s customers, using copious amounts of demographic data on US citizens.Researchers collected information from 55 government or non-partisan sources, including from state and local municipalities, going back to 1980the year Ballmer joined Microsoft. They kept analysis and interpretation to a minimum. Ballmers goal is to be completely unbiased. The billionaire said hes an independent and has been an active political donor in recent years, with a tendency to give to both sides. He wont say who hes voting for.Ballmer said the idea that the US is getting worse mostly isnt true. Infrastructure, such as road and bridge safety, is better than or comparable to 1990. The government doesnt seem as big as some people say it is, either. Of about 24 million government workers, teachers account for some 11 million jobs; police, firefighters and the like for 3 million; and military for about 2 million. Add in public hospitals, waste management, prisons and other workers, that leaves just 1.7 million or so bureaucrats.Mark Duggan, a Stanford economics professor who is teaching the course with Ballmer, said this project is especially important as Americans consider the need for spending cuts or other changes to Medicare or social security. What Steve is trying to do is to make it possible for people who want to make an informed decision to do that, Duggan said.Staff working on USAFacts said Ballmer already knows unusual factoids about government spending and demographics by heart. Ballmer, 60, said he doesnt recall as much as when he was 40.The project has helped settle Ballmers dispute with his wife. Government funding accounts for a larger share of many social-services organizations budgets for aiding children than private donations, he said. But economic mobility remains largely unachievable for Americas poorest families. The data helped convince the Ballmers to focus their philanthropy on impoverished kids in US cities with the lowest chances of improving their situations. Ballmer will continue making political contributions as well. He still believes influencing public policy is one of the most effective ways to effect change, he said. We were both right. Bloomberg",2016-11-07,IKynQKmVKvCEfR9CHez92J,Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer is poring over decades of government records to create a comprehensive accounting of US spending in Excel spreadsheets,21:08,Steve Ballmers plan to make America great involves Excel spreadsheets

-0.09,"New Delhi: The price paid for solar power in India at auction is set to fall below last years record lows for the South Asia nation, driven by plummeting panel prices, falling interest rates and competition among developers seeking a slice of the countrys renewables market.
				   
				Prices could dip lower than the Rs4.34 a kilowatt-hour offered in auctions held in Rajasthan a year ago, according to at least one developer of solar projects in India.This year we will see prices fall below Rs4 a kilowatt-hour for sure and it will be viable, said Rahul Munjal, chairman and managing director of Hero Future Energies Pvt., the clean-energy arm of Hero Group, one of Indias largest automakers.In 2016, countries from Chile to the United Arab Emirates broke records with deals to generate electricity from sunshine for less than 3 cents a kilowatt-hour, half the average global cost of coal power. With China and Japan joining the competitive-bidding bandwagon, as much as 25 gigawatts of solar capacity could be awarded through auctions this year globally, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.We feel interest rates will go down and the cost of solar panels will fall, so these will have a great effect on breaching the Rs4 a unit-mark, said Hero Futures Munjal, adding that hes looking at a 500 basis-point decline in domestic interest rates.Hero Future Energies, backed by the International Financial Corp., operates 360 megawatts of wind and solar capacity and has another 1.4 gigawatts of projects in the pipeline. The company plans to participate in some of the upcoming auctions.A decline in costs is one reason developers say prices at auction will drop.After falling 30% last year, the price of ordinary multi-crystalline silicon modules is expected to fall another 20% in 2017, according to London-based BNEF. Since 2009, solar prices are down 62%, with every part of the supply chain trimming costs.We expect these modules to sell for around $0.32 per watt, Jenny Chase, BNEFs chief solar analyst, said in a research note.Pent-up demand for nearly two gigawatts of solar capacity up for auctions in India in the early part of the year will also drive prices lower, said Rahul Goswami founder of Greenstone Energy Advisors, a boutique investment bank specializing in renewable energy deals in Asias third-largest economy.There is going to be a huge oversubscription in the coming auctions and everyone in 2017 will be looking at how do I go forward from my one gigawatt to 1.5 or 2 gigawatts, Goswami said in a phone interview, adding that fewer tenders in the last several months is adding to the pent-up demand.Auction processGreenstone, which is currently working to find an equity partner for Canadian renewable energy company SkyPower Ltds 350 megawatts of capacity under construction in India, concluded deals for 80 megawatts of solar capacity on behalf of Punj Lloyd Ltd in 2016. The investment bank also advised billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birlas Aditya Birla Nuvo Ltd on a tie-up with Dubai-based private equity investor The Abraaj Group to add solar power capacity in 2015.India is preparing to award 750 megawatts of solar capacity in Madhya Pradesh later this month and nearly 1 gigawatt more by March, according to state-run Solar Energy Corp. of India, the government agency that conducts Indias solar auctions.India adopted auctions in 2010 and is now racing to achieve Prime Minister Narendra Modis solar target of 100 gigawatts of capacity by 2022, a goal thats second only to China.Of the 25 gigawatts to be awarded through auctions, BNEFs Chase expects 8.5 gigawatts of that to be in India.

0.58,"San Francisco: Tracy Chou wrote a post on Medium in October 2013, challenging tech companies to tell the world what percentage of their software engineers were women. Surprisingly, it worked: Google, Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and others published their lopsided race and gender statistics, and Chou, then a Pinterest software engineer, became a face of the tech diversity movement. 
				   
				Pinterest positioned itself as a company working hard to hire more women as well as black and Latino workers. In 2015, the company made an unprecedented move: it published a set of diversity-focused hiring goals. It would strive to make 30% of its engineering hires women, and it would report on its progress in a year.Sixteen months later, Pinterest retreated. Despite all its efforts, only 22% of its new engineers were women, and in response, the company lowered its goal for next year from 30% to 25%. It had hit and exceeded its targets in two other categoriesmaking 8% of its engineering hires under-represented ethnic minorities, for example. Pinterest said it missed its women in engineering goal because it focused on hiring more senior women, which takes longer. But its admission that it had missed its mark and would lower expectations was a disappointment. Obviously we were all hoping it would be better and closer to 30%, said Chou, who left the company in June. Pinterests head of diversity, Candice Morgan, said the company sets goals that are challenging and that it thinks it has a 70% chance of reaching.ALSO READ | Why India needs more working womenPinterests big goaland its later retrenchmentshow how tech companies diversity ambitions can come with their own set of messes and challenges. In the two years since tech giants first revealed how most of their employees were white and Asian men, their diversity has only increased a few percentage points  or, in some cases, dropped. Most companies first response was to try to make their hiring processes more blind: stripping resumes of names and pictures, for example, to keep out information that might unintentionally bias an interviewer for or against a candidate.Now, some companies want to do more than cover their eyes. Its not enough to just publish demographic data and scrub names and pictures from resumes. Unlike other companies, Twitter and Pinterest set specific hiring goals. Facebook rewarded its recruiters extra for diversity hires. Microsoft is tying managers bonuses to their diversity hiring after the proportion of female workers fell for two consecutive years. Even small startups  like Penny, a four-person personal finance company in San Francisco thats the subject of the latest episode of Bloombergs Decrypted podcast  are evaluating candidates on whether they bring a new perspective to the team, in addition to their technical skills. Some companies are embracing affirmative action hiring, even if they are careful to call it something else.I have quite a few clients saying, We want to take it one step further, or saying, Listen, we did the unconscious bias thing, and we didnt get a lot out of it, said Y-Vonne Hutchinson, a diversity consultant who works with startups and helped found Project Include, a group of diversity advocates who publish guides of best practices for companies. Its happening in a way that wasnt happening last year.Hutchinson encourages companies to explore new tactics, but she also warns them to prepare for resistance. Affirmative action gets a lot of blowback, but it was one of the most successful ways of getting people from under-represented groups into jobs and institutions they were excluded from, Hutchinson said. Shes African-American, and she said affirmative action helped her mother get a federal government job. I dont think tech has embraced affirmative action because theyre really married to the idea of a meritocracy.ALSO READ | The HR trends of 2017Instead of calling it affirmative action, companies are looking for a policy that looks like that, talks like that, but isnt perceived as that, Hutchinson said. Companies want to discuss equal opportunity without the terms quotas and affirmative action, she said.Should tech companies ignore a candidates background when deciding whether to hire themor should they factor it in? The debate is ongoing, said Chou, who is also part of Project Include. (She said she left Pinterest not out of disappointment, but because she wanted to try something new.)Itd be cleaner and easier if making the hiring process blind suddenly led to more women and minorities being hired, but thats often insufficient, Chou said. Active policies to promote diversity, on the other hand, can strike some job candidates as unjust. People feel its an unfair judgment on them if they get turned down and someone they feel is objectively less than them in some way is hired, she said.At Pinterest, the pressure of reporting public hiring goals could be felt inside the company. That internal conversationWere not going to hit this, and its going to look really bad if we dontmade people haul ass and get their shit together, Chou said. Morgan, Pinterests head of diversity, wrote in an email: Setting public goals focused and encouraged the team to have more authentic conversations and learn more about how to make meaningful progress ... Theyve resulted in the most diverse team Pinterest has had to date.Pinterest asked some of its employees to recommend a certain number of candidates from under-represented groups for jobs at Pinterest, and some workers felt those goals were unfairly distributed, Chou said. Some employees pushed back when they were encouraged to refer the same number of people as a larger team and asked if the referrals should be prorated, she said. It was a little frustrating to hear the grumblings but also not that surprising, as people tend to grumble about any extra work that theyre asked to do, Chou said. Morgan said the company later tailored its requests based on feedback from engineering leaders.At Facebook, recruiters in 2015 were told to prioritize finding diversity candidatesengineers that werent white or Asian men, according to former recruiters who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to talk about their work. After a few months, the recruiters became frustrated, because they said most of their minority engineering candidates didnt end up getting an offer. From 2015 to 2016, the number of women in technology roles at Facebook increased 1 %, and its proportion of black and Latino workers stayed flat. Two former recruiters blamed the engineering departments hiring process, which gave veto power to a small group of engineering leaders that signed off on every offer. Though Facebook pushed recruiters to look for diversity, those making hiring decisions were not held accountable to those same goals, according to the former recruiters.Even when the hires are made, other employees may grow resentful. GitHub, a site where coders can store and share their work, hired consultant Nicole Sanchez in 2015 to create and lead its Social Impact team, which focuses on improving diversity efforts. The team is now 11 out of the companys 600 employees, and it pushed strongly for more diversity among the people who interviewed job seekers, the company said.Some employees groused. Two former GitHub employees said the Social Impact team would question hiring practices and choices and ruled with a heavy hand. The former employees, who declined to be identified out of fear of reprisal from the company, also alleged that GitHub sometimes missed out on the best talent by focusing too much on a candidates background. A GitHub spokeswoman declined to comment.When tech companies talk about hiring, they often talk about bringing in the best person possible and ignoring everything else. For many, best has meant the person whos most technically skilled or who will be shipping code the soonest after they start.But some are redefining best to factor in diversity. At Penny, which builds a chatbot that texts users analysis and advice about their spending, chief executive officer (CEO) Mitchell Lee wanted the companys fifth hire to add diversity to the team. He spent the fall looking for candidates who were different from the four men who already worked there  affirmative action hiring, in his own words.ALSO READ: Snapchat picks London for its international headquartersWhen I say affirmative action, I mean I want to be able to see someones picture, Lee said. If asked to choose between two hypothetical candidates who are equally qualified for a job at Penny, then he rejects the premise as false: Those two people are not equally qualified. Somebody with a diverse background and a totally different perspective is more qualified for the position were trying to fill, which is expanding upon the collective viewpoint of what Penny has, he said.Lee found that some candidates were dropping out of the interview process along the way, and they were often those he was particularly interested in  women or people with unusual backgrounds. He started checking in with those candidates more frequently, encouraging them along the way. It helped. But he said it showed him how much more was needed beyond getting diverse candidates in the mix: He needed to earn the trust of many of them. Its really hard to convey, especially if youre like me and youre a white guy in his mid-twenties trying to tell candidates that diversity is something you care about, he said.In December, after several months of searchingLee estimates he looked through hundreds of candidatesPenny hired a fifth person, Vertika Srivastava, an Indian-American woman who went to the University of Michigan and worked as a software developer at Accenture. The four current employees are excited for her to start. But Lee and the other Penny workersthey all had a saywaffled when deciding whether to give her an offer. Pennys developers code mostly in Ruby, a programming language Srivastava doesnt have much experience in.At one point during the interview process, Srivastava asked the four Penny guys why they were interested in her. They listed some aspects of her personality, and they were blunt: It was also because shes a woman. I liked that they didnt tiptoe around that, she said. She starts this week.Pennys approach is different than that of most companies. Pinterest and Twitter dont talk about quotas; they talk about hiring goals. Stacy Brown-Philpot, the African-American CEO of TaskRabbit, an on-demand job platform, has pledged to make the companys workforce represent the ethnic and racial makeup of the country. She said on stage at a conference in October that in order to get there, the company will need to over-index on certain groups, though she followed that up with: I dont know if I would say its affirmative action.Slack, a $3.8 billion workplace chat service startup, practices intentional hiring, said Leslie Miley, its director of engineering and a diversity advocate. The company actively looks for people outside of the standard 20 schools and six companies, he said, and they value what historically hasnt been valued in Silicon Valley. That means measuring people by distance travelledhow far theyve come in life instead of just looking for a Stanford computer science degree. Miley said that candidates who would score higher on this metric could include those who were the first in their family to go to college, or are veterans, or went to community college.But Miley dislikes the term affirmative action. The amount of baggage attached to that term is horrid, he said. When you say affirmative action, the very next question most people have is, Are we going to lower the bar? So lets not call it that. Lets call it hiring the way hiring always should have been. What I want is a level playing field. Bloomberg",2017-01-10,KBcVjMqer3e46kpPzpRv6I,"Maintaining diversity among employees, yet hiring the best is the next challenge facing the Silicon Valley employers",19:39,Some tech companies are trying affirmative action hiring
1.0,"Rohini Nilekani, chairperson and founder of not-for-profit Arghyam, is a former journalist, writer and philanthropist. She co-founded Pratham Books, a non-profit publishing enterprise to produce high-quality, low-cost books for children in several Indian languages. Nilekani has been involved in development issues for several years. In an interview, she sp aks about how the wealthy can be persuaded to give more to charity, why access to natural resources is important for improving lives and the India Philanthropy Initiative. Edited excerpts from the interview conducted by Bridgespan in partnership with Mint: 
One of the under-reported elements in the new strategic philanthropy era is the element of personal reward and the joy that comes from philanthropy. What do you consider to be your most rewarding philanthropic experiences recently?Yes, you are absolutely right that our brains are wired for altruism and what keeps altruism going in the human race is the actual joy you get out of it. You have to watch out that it doesnt turn into a sort of ego-driven joy. But when I meet children reading the books we published at Pratham Books, it gives me the most undiluted joy. But also at a more fundamental level, being able to work with communities to improve their water resources and then to see what a difference it makes, especially to the lives of women. We have helped with spring restoration, for example, and when communities are able to get sustainable, safe water, thats been a deep fundamental satisfaction as well. Can you give an example or idea where philanthropy can change the power structure?One of the great conundrums in philanthropy globally is that the way wealth creation happens itself often creates the inequities in society. In the ideal world, philanthropy should be redundant or at least it should be at the edges, as innovation or risk capital. But its far from an ideal world; the wealthy are cornering more and more opportunities and resources from this planet. So, the big challenge for philanthropy iscan it engage with the distribution of wealth itself? It is very difficult, let me tell you. Once you are wealthy, you are in a nice comfort zone and want to stay there. So I always look in the mirror and ask, is my philanthropy making the world a more just and fair place? Take the water example; because when people dont have access to water, its very hard to have good health, good income and livelihoods, so I think the work on water is about restructuring power. So also with some of the other work that I do on ecology, I think peoples access to the natural resource base really does make a difference in how they can bootstrap themselves up to a better life.What can be done or needs to be done to stimulate the newly wealthy in India? I think those who are already in philanthropy and enjoying it and making a difference have a responsibility to share their stories widely, and to be very transparent about their giving. That is very necessary in India today. There also needs to be public pressure on the wealthy, and government policy should make it easier to give. The regulatory cholesterol around setting up charitable organizations can be cleaned up. I think enabling non-profits, which are essentially the absorptive pipeline for philanthropy, is critical. And right now there is distrust between government and NGOs (non-governmental organizations), which I think is not healthy. So we do need government and NGOs to sit at the table and say how can we make the NGO sector more transparent? How can we then have less regulation and make it easier to function? I think all this will help to increase philanthropy in India.Can you talk a little bit about the role of big bets in India? Is there a need for more strategic action?I think we have seen international philanthropists take these audacious big bets and obviously the (Bill and Melinda) Gates Foundation comes to my mind, when they deploy their capital to crack some vaccine or child mortality. I mean that sounds like the kind of areas we used to leave to God or at least to the big state! But it is wonderful that people who have become so incredibly wealthy are now putting their intellectual capital along with their monetary capital to say, why cant we just be audacious and crack things that have just not cracked for so long? It has its risks; it always has its risks when individuals use their power and wealth to solve something because unless it comes with a set of checks and balances in society, sometimes you can also go very wrong. But I am all for these big bets and in India I dont think we have taken enough of them. I hope we mature to that.You are involved with other philanthropists in establishing and leading Indian philanthropic initiatives...The India Philanthropy Initiative was set up by a few of us under Azim Premjis leadership. We have decided to take it slowly but the goal is to see how we can inspire much more philanthropy in India. We are learning to see if we can be effective as a group of philanthropists, pushing each others limit. And we are best as a peer-to-peer network where we can freely ask questions and learn.ALSO READ | You really want to be doing things that make a difference: Ratan TataDo you think the expression and experience of philanthropy in India can be distinctive?It can be made distinctive. If we really get back into the roots of our culture and philosophy, we can bring that out into the modern era by infusing it with new meaning about responsibility in society. And you can make it as spiritual as you want it to be or make it just about creating a better democracy. So yes, there is potential to infuse Indian philanthropy with a deeply culturally rooted new meaning. And that is a journey worth taking I think.ALSO READ | Being positive is not a curseALSO READ | Growth of wealth gives way for growth in charityThe Bridgespan Group, an adviser and resource for mission-driven leaders and organizations, in partnership with Mint interviewed several philanthropists across India to trace their journeys and share their learningsConversations with Remarkable Givers: India.

0.25,"Mumbai: Dry powderthe amount of cash with private equity (PE)/venture capital (VC) fundsstands close to a six-year high of $7.1 billion, data from private deal tracker Preqin shows, suggesting an improved fund-raising environment.
				   
				Preqin data shows that following a low of $2.1 billion in fund-raising by India-based funds in 2012, the industry has managed to raise $3.4 billion and $3.8 billion in 2014 and 2015, respectively.There is a fair amount of appetite for Indian funds, both private equity, venture capital and those investing in public markets. The number of enquiries that we have witnessed in the last six months is higher than what we had seen in the previous two years, said Rajesh Begur, founder and managing partner of law firm ARA Law.Sentiment around the Indian economy is positive, given programmes such as Make In India, improving ease of doing business and the relatively favourable macroeconomic factors vis-a-vis other emerging economies, he added.The improved sentiment is reflected in the number of fund managers that are in the market to raise money.According to a Mint analysis, several other established PE firms are in the market to collectively raise over $3 billion worth of capital. PE firms that are in the process of raising capital from investors include IDFC Alternatives ($500 million), ChrysCapital ($650 million), PE veteran Ajay Relans CX Partners ($400 million), Tata Opportunities Fund ($600 million), Aditya Birla Private Equity ($500 million) and growth capital funds Tata Growth Equity ($350 million), Tano Capital ($200 million) and Motilal Oswal Private Equity ($300 million).Several-first time fund managers are, meanwhile, trying to raise almost $2 billion, Mint reported in July.The high amount of dry powder coincides with a sharp decline in deal volume in the Indian market.According to data from VCCEdge, in the nine months to 30 September, 945 PE deals worth $8.8 billion were recorded, which in terms of deal volume was lower by 47.3% from the previous year.Limited partners, or investors in PE/VC funds, believe the slowdown in deal volume at a time when funds are sitting on a large amount of cash is a sign of increased discipline among fund managers.I dont think the slowdown in deal volume is a reflection of either the quality or quantity of opportunity available. It is more an influence of the growing investing discipline that fund managers are exercising today as compared to the 2007-08 vintages, said Nupur Garg, regional lead, South Asia, private equity and venture funds at International Finance Corp (IFC).Valuations too have played a part in deal volume slowdown, resulting in funds sitting on a larger amount of cash.There has been a significant reduction in the number of transactions, with high valuation expectations being the primary reason. People are looking for fewer deals, but good deals at right valuations, said Begur of ARA Law.Data also shows that increasingly more dry powder has got concentrated with a few established fund managers.Of the $7.1 billion dry powder, almost $5.59 billion or close to 80% is with established funds.Data also shows that the top five funds with the most dry powder are holding close to $2.8 billion. These include funds such as Everstone Capital ($654.9 million), Multiples Alternate Asset Management ($577.5 million) and Nexus Venture Partners ($551.9 million).The share of first-time fund managers has fallen to around 20% compared to 2011, when they had almost 35% of the dry powder. As of November, first-time fund managers held around $1.51 billion worth of dry powder.The number of fund managers in the market has reduced and capital is getting concentrated in the hands of fewer fund managers. The appetite for first-time funds has improved in the last few years, with some of the first-time teams bringing prior private equity experience to the tablebut there are only a few first-time funds being raised, said Garg of IFC.A significant increase in dry powder is also attributable to VC funds.The dry powder available with VC funds has almost doubled to $3.1 billion as of November, compared to a figure of $1.5 billion at the end of calendar year 2011.Data shows that venture capital deals saw a decline of 39% in terms of number of deals and 58% in terms of deal value for the nine months ended 30 September, having registered 267 transactions worth $1.98 billion.",2016-11-11,KDsiIBoGmugc0dP4BXtrCI,"India-based funds have $7.1 bn of dry powder, shows data from deal tracker Preqin",00:20,Cash hoard of PE/VC funds at six-year high
0.25,"On Saturday, 5 November, India hosted the ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) 57 meeting in Hyderabad. If the Internet has a backbone, ICANN is it. From its inception in 1998 until 1 October this year, it was based in and controlled by the US. That the first summit after the US ceded control was held in India makes for neat symbolism. But if New Delhi wishes India to have a significant say in global Internet governance going forwarda mustit will have to go beyond mere symbolism.
				   
				ICANNs history is a study in the tensions between traditional state power and the decentralised nature of the Internet. Back in the dark ages of the Internet when only a handful of websites existed, American computer scientist Jon Postel administered the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). This is the body responsible for delegating and managing domain names and Internet protocol addresses globallywhat makes it possible for someone to go to the correct website when they type, say, livemint.com. In 1998, management of IANA was taken over by ICANN, a private sector, non-profit body created for this purpose. But crucially, ICANN answered to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration of the US Department of Commerce. In essence, the US government controlled vital Internet infrastructure.This has been a point of contention in recent years. To be fair, successive US governments have used their suzerainty sparingly and fairly. But other states have been understandably unwilling to bank on Washingtons goodwill and ethical fibre in this matter of global security, economic activity and development. India has been one of them. However, its stand has been confused and wrongheaded at various points. The primary point of contention has been whether a multilateral governance approachone in which national governments would be the primary stakeholders and agentsor a multi-stakeholder approach that would incorporate a variety of voices from civil society, the private sector and academia, is best suited to succeed the US.The latter wins out on several fronts. The decentralised, transnational nature of the Internet has underpinned its innovation and economic and developmental benefits. Ringfencing crucial governance issues from the multiple non-state stakeholders that have made it what it isand worse, subjecting it to the bureaucratic wrangling that is inevitable in any multilateral bodywould be highly counterproductive. But, as Arun Mohan Sukumar points out in The Wire, despite then-information technology minister Kapil Sibal paying lip service to multi-stakeholderism in 2012, the previous administration sent confusing signals, pushing at various points for a greater government role in Internet governance.Thankfully, current IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasads unequivocal statement last year about an Indian vision for the Internetone that sees multi-stakeholderism as the only way forwardshows that the Narendra Modi government has settled upon a cohesive, sensible approach. This is a pragmatic decision given that the proponents of a multilateral approach included China and Russiaand under the circumstances, Washington had made it clear it would not cede control of ICANN to an inter-governmental body. The problem, however, is that given Indias track record so far, converting its support for a multi-stakeholder model into an actionable approach that gives it a voice in shaping future outcomes is going to take some doing.    On Saturday, Prasad chided the Indian private sector for not participating in global policymaking processes related to the Internet. He was right as far as it goes. But he failed to mention that Indian involvement in generalincluding at the governmental levelhas been anemic through the years at ICANN summits and other such forums. At a time when the Modi government has explicitly recognised the transformational potential of the Internetboth economically and for quality of governancevia the Digital India initiative, New Delhi cannot afford a low level of engagement with the global policymaking apparatus that will shape its future.Perhaps the first step to redressing the current state of affairs is looking at the domestic policymaking process in Internet-related issues. A Centre for Communication Governance report, Analysing Indian Engagement at Global Internet Governance Institutions 2011-2015 by Puneeth Nagaraj and Aarti Bhavana notes that the small number of civil society, academic and government representatives who have participated in global governance forums so far have shared concerns regarding accountability, legitimacy, diversity and capacity. Thats well and goodexcept that when it comes to freedom of expression, website blocking, policy issues such as the encryption bill and the geospatial bill, and a multitude of other such issues, successive governments have been unconcerned with the need to engage civil society and technical experts adequately.The capabilities and willingness to participate in global governance at the international level will not come into existence in a vacuum. They must first be cultivated at the domestic level.

				Facebook said Wednesday that its revenue rose 51% in the fourth quarter, and it turned 52 cents of every dollar into operating profit. That is a remarkable profit margin, and Facebooks best ever.It was also the fifth consecutive quarter of more than 50% revenue growtha re-acceleration after the companys growth rate had seemingly peaked in 2014. And the number of people who use Facebook or the Facebook Messenger app at least once a month continued to climb, up 17% to 1.86 billionmore than the combined populations of China and the US.Money machineFacebook has already warned its incredible revenue growth wont continue after mid-2017 because it wont be able to keep shoving more ads interspersed in the feed of Facebook posts. This increased ad load has been a significant source of Facebooks recent growth in advertising sales, although it is unclear how much. Facebook also said its costs would rise this year because it is investing more in its business.Even if Facebooks growth slows in coming months, Alphabet Inc.s Google and Facebook keep extending their advantage over everyone else in the digital advertising industry. That gives both companies the lead time and resources to find their next acts, and they are already laying the groundwork. Like Google, Facebook keeps finding new potential hot spots for revenue. For Facebook, those new targets are its Instagram app and video everywhere in Facebooks world. Mark Zuckerberg cant stop talking about how Facebook is becoming more centered on video because it is following the lead of people who are taking and watching more video online. But the focus on video also has the advantage of opening his company to big piles of fresh ad dollars. With $27 billion in 2016 advertising, Facebook took roughly 5% of all global advertising spending. The TV industry is around 35%. That is a juicy target. Digital versus TVThat means the next big technology prizefight isnt Facebook versus Google versus Snapchat, but the digital world duking it out against television. All them have their eyes on the roughly $190 billion spent each year on TV commercials. If Facebook grabs just 3% of ad dollars spent on TV in the US, it would add more than $2 billion, or about 7%, to its annual revenue.To make the TV money come to Facebook, the company is doing everything it can to become more like TV. (Googles YouTube is doing the same.) The company has tried to get more people to shoot videos of themselves and post them live; it is making a big push for Snapchat-type video clips in its Instagram app; and it is tweaking its computer models to emphasize more TV-like longer videos that hook people. Video starFacebooks transformation into something more like TV wont be simple. Its advertising turned out to be ideally suited to the last five years of Internet use shifting from computers to smartphones. Its not clear Facebook has a similar pole position for the shift in advertising from TV to digital video. Facebook has been reluctant, until recently, to interrupt videos with commercial messages as TV does, perhaps because people flee during those digital ad breaks.The TV players arent sitting still, either, and are trying to adapt to changes in viewer and advertiser behaviour. Theyre trying to become more like Facebook, before Facebook becomes like them.",2017-02-03,LSOxWEWnvxP8praR2Qv3CL,Mark Zuckerberg cant stop talking about how Facebook is becoming more centered on video because it is following the lead of people who are taking and watching more video online,02:29,Facebook wants to be a TV star next

				Back home, too, the Indian Meteorological Departments (IMDs) initial monsoon estimate is forecasting good rainfall.A more detailed region-wise estimate will follow later but for now, one should assume good rains may result in higher tea output.Investors should be keeping an eye on these developments as they assess the prospects for tea companies.The higher tea output in the worlds major tea producing countries is a red flag for tea prices. In Kenya, the first two months of 2016 have seen tea output rise by 43% over the same months a year ago, according to data from Africa Tea Brokers Ltd. But thats also due to a low base effect as dry weather had affected output in 2015. If we change the base to 2014, the current years output is still higher by 19.8%. If rainfall continues to favour tea output in the next few months, then we are likely to see a substantial increase in Kenyas output in 2016.Indias tea season in North India will pick up pace later; in 2015, the high months for tea production were between May and November. Tea trading company Van Rees said in its latest weekly report that heavy pre-monsoon showers and a favourable winter in the North have led to higher crop levels this year. In its round-up, it says it expects plenty of tea in the near future. Indias North India plantations accounted for four-fifths of tea output, according to the Tea Board of Indias data, with South India bringing up the rest. Abundant tea output globally could signal weak trends in auction prices. Whether prices trend weak and by how much is an important factor determining the performance of companies. Costs are another factor. Last year, tea company McLeod Russel India Ltd had said it expects costs to increase by 13% due to higher input costs and wages. In the current year, it expects costs to increase by 7%.While a lower increase in costs is indeed beneficial, a decline in tea prices could nullify that. Shares of leading tea companies have been rising since the past few months.

				Comparatively the country as a whole has seen a growth of 5.1% during the period. Consumption is high in states where rainfall is low. Tamil Nadu, which has been declared drought-hit by the state government, saw a 12% rise in electricity usage. Karnataka, which also saw scanty rains, has seen a 10% rise in power usage, points out Motilal Oswal, citing data from Central Electricity Authority.CSR adoption by Indian companies on the riseThe spending of listed Indian companies on corporate social responsibility (CSR) is rising and the proportion of firms spending closer to 2% of profits is going up, according to a report by Crisil Foundation. Spending on CSR was up by 22% in fiscal year 2016 over a year ago. Larger companies reported improved compliance, with 53% of those with sales of over Rs10,000 crore spending 2% or more of profit on CSR during FY16, compared to 31% in the year earlier. Among smaller firms, 57% with sales of Rs100-500 crore and 56% with sales of Rs500-10,000 crore reported spending 2% or more. Of course, this can also be seen as a cup half empty, as there is a long way to go before a majority of companies become compliant with the 2% spending rule.

				During 2000-12, newly floated funds achieved a higher median net internal rate of return than all other funds in all but one year (2004). Overall, limited partners (LPs) are more likely to invest with first-time managers now, with as many as half the investors surveyed saying they would at least consider committing to a brand new private capital fund, compared to 39% in 2013. About 400 LPs across the world were surveyed.The increased confidence in investing with first-time fund managerslargely break-outs or spin-offs from established fundsaugur well for many such managers who are looking to raise money.

0.44,"Bengaluru: Back in 2008, 25-year-old Rohan Murty embarked on an unusual road trip. He travelled to various US cities around the Washington, DC metro area on his own, often walking for miles from one city to another. It was far from a thrill-seeking adventurehe was a man on a mission. Murty drove more than a thousand miles through forests and in the middle of nowhere.
				   
				Using a technology system he had built at Harvard Universitywhere he was at the time pursuing his PhD in computer scienceMurty was attempting to measure the actual usage of licensed and unlicensed spectrumwhich is typically used by telecom companies, TV and radio stations, as well as for technology such as Wi-Fi. He stopped every few miles, in order to validate the correctness of his research and the software he had built. What he found out during that study would lay the basis for his research into technology that is referred to as White Space Network or White-Fi. In laymans terms, White-Fi refers to unutilized television broadcast frequencies or white spaces that are potentially capable of delivering low-cost Internet connectivity to rural and remote parts of a country. What I found out during that trip was that spectrum in general is severely underutilized, says Murty. Murty jokingly recalls that at one point, he was even stopped by a state police officer, who wondered why some scrawny, brown kid was walking around suspiciously with an unusual technical device on a US highway. A vocal proponent of White-Fiwhich he believes has the potential to deliver affordable Internet connectivity to hundreds of millions of Indians across the remotest parts of the countryMurty is of the view that the Indian government needs to make a stronger push for White-Fi and does not agree with the current stand of top telcos such as Airtel and Vodafone, which have so far opposed the use of white spaces. Companies like Microsoft have also in recent months urged the government to fight for White-Fi and oppose the telecom lobby, citing the examples of countries like the US and UK where unlicensed spectrum usage has been permitted. In an interview, Murty, son of Infosys Ltd founder N.R. Narayana Murthy and a junior fellow at the Society of Fellows at Harvard University, spoke primarily on his research on White-Fi, how his work focused on architecture for dynamic spectrum access in wireless networks and other work that he is doing on the sidelines. Aside from helping manage investments for the Murthy family office, Catamaran Ventures, he has also made some angel investments under the radarincluding a small investment in Bengaluru-based start-up Floh, which is a singles network that helps urban and educated singles find life partners. Edited excerpts:What do you make of current debates around spectrum usage in India? The telcos have so far fiercely opposed the use of white spaces and unlicensed spectrum...Let me zoom back a little. Historically weve always thought of spectrum as a binary sort of thingeither somebody has exclusive access to it or nobody has exclusive access to it. So, its either licensed or unlicensed. Example of licensed, is TV, radio, cellphone companies, etc. Wi-Fi is an example of unlicensed spectrum, its the technology that Wi-Fi operates overthats one example. Wi-Fi is just a piece of technology though, not a piece of spectrum. Now, lets take an examplelets say you have a wire between your computer and the Internet. And you pump data through. Think of the wire as a pipe and data as water. The more volume of water you pump, the more data you are pumping through. But there is a limit before the pipe explodes, in some sense. So, what do you do when the pipe saturates? All you have to do is instal one more pipeor in this case, one more wire. So, in some sense you can have infinite bandwidthbecause you just keep installing more wires. And that works. But when you move to the wireless world, this is not the right analogy. The wireless world is like a highwaythe width is fixed, you cant increase the width at all. That is a limitation of nature. So, the capacity of a wireless world is boundthere is a maximum you can extract out of it. So, now you have these lanes on the highwaywhen you licence some part of the spectrum to someone, you basically say hey, this lane is yours. Nobody else can touch it. And then there is another lane which is for the public and they use Wi-Fi for it. Now, what happens is that more and more cars are getting into this lane and there is only one lane. And we start saturating this lane. What do we do? We look across at the licensed lane, which is registered to someone and we see that nobody is using it frequently and its just sitting there. But the law states that you can only use this one lane. And all this while more and more cars are coming and we feel there is scarcity. But the truth is that this is artificial scarcity. So, the work I ended up doing was to see if those unused lanes could be used without interfering with someone elses licensed lane and on how to detect the presence of others in that lane. When I detect youre coming, then I just get out and go back in the other lane. India seems to be lagging countries such as the US and the UK in terms of embracing the opportunity hereAbsolutely. India is behind in terms of thinking of new forms of spectrum usage. I do believe that is the case. If you go talk to the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) in the US and Ofcom in the UK, just look at some of the progressive things these guys are doing. In India, weve seen companies like Google and Facebook attempt moon shots with permission from the government and provide Internet access through balloon projects such as Loon to remote parts of the country. But weve surprisingly seen opposition on White-Fi. What does the government and the telecom lobby need to do on this matter? Is there a general lack of understanding of how this technology can benefit the masses? There is no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem. I dont think the answer is that telcos will solve everything. If they claim that, I dont agree with that. I dont think balloons will solve everything either. All these different technologies will play a role and theyll fit different needs. I think it will fulfil an important need. You cannot solve everything (with just White-Fi) as well. Lets assume that spectrum operated by Wi-Fi was operated by a telcoalmost certainly it wouldnt have taken off. Every time you would have turned your Wi-Fi modem on, you would pay the telco money. Today you dont pay anybody anything. So, I dont agree with the view that telcos will solve every problem. What is the potential of White-Fi in terms of connecting millions to affordable Internet? If spectrum is a good owned by the people, then the right thing is you want to raise revenue from it and at the same time want to maximize the usage of spectrum. Lets assume that you raise revenue from it and the spectrum is actually not being used. Then you have a losing proposition... I dont know if (White-Fi) can solve all (connectivity) problems, but it can certainly have a positive impact and become one of the many technologies that helps. And fundamentally, in my mind, it alters the way we think about spectrum. These are important policy decisions which will alter peoples lives down the line. I do admire the US on thistheyve been much more open-minded on this. I think there is a case to be made here as well. I think it is inevitable that there will be an increasing wave of opportunism in terms of spectrum use. Its like what Andy Grove said once: if you have a great piece of technology, you can send lawyers and bureaucrats to delay it. Ultimately the technology goes around it. Can you talk about some of your work in this area? Aside from my thesis on this subject, I even have a follow-on paper that was published. Its all there in my thesisits called SATYA, which was an algorithm, a system that we built with one of my professors at Harvard, where we showed that even on top of this, you can actually raise revenues. We showed how it lowers the barrier for access to spectrum, while also increasing overall revenues. This will be an inevitable part of our futureand thats what my work shows, what are some of these challenges and how do we overcome them. And how it will fundamentally alter our view on how spectrum is used.So, what are some of the challenges facing India?In this country and every country, our issue is about how do you connect more and more people to the Internet. There are a couple of different ways in which it can happen. One, you assume there is a fibre to every home. But we both know thats prohibitively expensive to build and to maintain. Its not easy. Second, everything will be through wireless, such as 4G. I think thatll work to a certain extent, but as we have seen in other countries such as the UK and the US, if you try to wire up large portions of the country where you dont have purchasing power, then the economic argument is not justified. In my mind, Ive always felt there is some other way to connect these people. I think there is room to wire up large parts of the country with some sort of semi-unlicensed spectrum. So, are we talking about the need for a wide-scale policy overhaul in India on this matter?Absolutely. Separately, how do you view Reliance Jios entry and the current price wars that are brewing between telcos?Im a fan of anything where the consumer wins. If I can get 4G everywhere at a reasonable price, Im happy.",2016-12-10,MZp7mAMVUiI5Nm8jZaqvwK,"The founder of Murty Classical Library on his research on White-Fi, or white space network, and the focus on architecture for dynamic spectrum access in wireless networks",01:48,Spectrum in general is underutilized: Rohan Murty
0.25,"Bengaluru: Wipro Ltd, which launched its artificial intelligence (AI) platform Holmes 18 months ago, is now making its biggest push to embrace automation by allowing more of its managers to identify work which will not require engineers in each of the over 20,000 projects currently underway.
				   
				This bold development, according to one executive who did not want to be identified will mean Wipro doesnt just save on costs (thereby arresting falling profitability), but fundamentally alters the traditional model of deploying armies of engineers to undertake maintenance work.To be sure, that could also mean that its current workforce needs to learn new technology skills swiftly to stay relevant.Wipro is in the process of appointing individual leaders in each of the six industry-serving segments (which the company calls strategic business units) and five solution offering verticals or practices, who will be entrusted with the job of automating mundane maintenance work.Until now, Wipros chief technology officer K.R. Sanjiv, in consultation with various segment heads used to decide which projects could use Holmes. Wipros two larger rivals, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd, too have a similar centralized division that oversees the adoption of their respective intelligent automation platforms, Ignio and Mana. This explains why these companies, which employ hundreds of thousands of engineers, have embraced automation only in tiny pockets.At Wipro, this will now change. We announced internally in this quarter that we will have a more federated structure than running it from a central unit, which will further increase the pace (of adoption), Abidali Neemuchwala, chief executive officer of Wipro said last month.Hyper-automation is one of the central pillars of Neemuchwalas vision of making Wipro a $15 billion firm by 2020 with an operating margin of 23%. Wipro ended the year to March with $7.35 billion in revenue and 20.5% profitability. Wipro is consolidating all its automation assets and capabilities under the Holmes brand and significantly increasing its investment in hyper-automation. Going forward, every strategic business unit, service line and delivery unit will have dedicated leaders for Holmes, said a spokesperson for Wipro. They will be responsible for adoption of the existing capability and ideation of new use cases.In the first six months of the current financial year, Wipro claims to have freed and redeployed over 4,300 employees in newer areas of work, on account of automation. The managements decision to decentralize decision-making means Wipro could look to automate work of close to 10,000 engineers by the end of the financial year, according to a second executive who spoke on condition of anonymity.We are well ahead of our plan for the financial year. (But) we will not be able to provide information beyond what has so far been disclosed publicly, said the spokesperson.Experts are encouraged by the managements decision.Aligned with a market maturation around the broad notion of Intelligent Automation, Wipro is changing gears in the way it is engaging with stakeholders, said Thomas Reuner, the managing director at IT outsourcing advisory, HfS Research.Each of these Holmes leaders will be evaluated on the work they can automate. All of them will have individual targets, said the second executive. Until now, much of the work (that has been automated) is what is maintenance or L0 type. Hopefully, as we push automation, more L1 or L2 (higher order) work in areas such as application development or even software writing can be automated.Wipros aggressive push towards embracing automation comes at a time when automation platforms and cloud computing are threatening to erase the labour arbitrage enjoyed by Indian IT vendors.Still, Wipro, which has focused on demonstrating robust delivery and learning the lessons from the early deployments of its AI platform, will now, much like its peers, demonstrate that it can manage the transition from labour arbitration to automation in profitable manner, said Reuner.",2016-11-02,MfyyMa0zsQOTnJQGmZqHqK,Wipro is appointing individual leaders in each of the six industry-serving segments and five solution-offering verticals to reduce mundane maintenance work,04:35,Wipro in biggest automation push since launch of Holmes AI platform
-0.55,"Mumbai: If the much-hyped Unified Payments Interface (UPI) of the National Payments Corp. of India is not working as well as it should, blame the large banks.
				   
				Thats the surmise of the Economic Survey 2017 which studied a huge volume of transactions of the so-called Aadhar-enable payment system and discovered that transactions between customers of different banks failed much more often than those between customers of the same bank. The so-called decline rate (failure rate) was 56% in the case of the former, almost double that of the failure rate in the latter. Aaadhar enabled payment system is a bank led model which allows online interoperable transactions at micro ATMs through the business correspondent of any bank using the Aadhaar authentication.One plausible hypothesis for this differential is that the larger banks are declining transactions involving smaller remitting banks while ensuring that transactions involving themselves are honoured, the survey said. The survey warned that as more entities join the UPI, banks should facilitate interoperability instead of thwarting it. But such problems will need to be addressed, since payments banks, telecommunications companies, and small banks are in the vanguard of financial inclusion. So their access to the UPI platform will be critical for advancing digitalization, especially for the poor, the survey said.The Economic Surveys comment is telling.Digital wallet companies raised concerns about banks blocking transactions to protect their turf. Recently, ICICI Bank blocked transactions on payments app PhonePe, citing security issues and violation of UPI guidelines on inter-operability. State Bank of India also blocked net banking transactions with e-wallet companies, although it allowed customers to top their mobile wallets with debit and credit cards. Principally we have favoured interoperability not just among banks but also among banks and non-banks. The proportion of cash transactions still continue to be high. There is therefore a need to take a long term view for the industry. Anything that comes in the way of being interoperable is not good, said Naveen Surya of the Payments Council of India, a lobby group of digital wallet companies. Ever since the government decision to ban Rs500 and Rs1,000 currency notes on 8 November, it has tried to promote cashless transactions. The biggest beneficiaries of this move have been digital payment firms and wallet operators. According to the latest RBI data, the volume of UPI transactions in January was 3.9 million as against 2 million in December. Value of UPI transactions more than doubled to Rs 15.1 billion during the period Interoperability is an equally important tenet across payment system. This is something that is agreed to by all. We believe that if an entity does not follow the interoperability regime, then we have all our rights to stop that and give them time to become interoperable.

				Indraprastha Gas Ltd., an arm of state-owned gas utility Gail (India) Ltd will soon introduce air-conditioners running on gas in collaboration with a few New Zealand-based manufacturers in a bid to increase gas consumption in the country, managing director E.S. Ranganathan said.The gas utility, which has 6.5 lakh customers for piped gas in the national capital region and has a target of reaching 11 lakh in three years, is trying to create new markets for gas by diversifying into appliances running on the clean fuel. It has already started promoting gas-run power generators in institutions and residential complexes which replace costly and polluting diesel generation sets.The move is part of the oil ministrys plan to shift towards a gas-based economy in which the clean fuel will replace diesel and coal for power generation and petrol and diesel for transportation (by way of condensed natural gas or CNG). Government wants the share of gas in the hydrocarbon mix to go up from about 7% now to 25% in a few years.Our business development group is working on introducing air conditioners and geysers running on gas. This will be useful in areas such as Ghaziabad in the national capital region or Rewari in Haryana, where there are four hours of power cut, said Ranganathan.IGLs idea is to introduce a cost effective air conditioner, which will enable the consumer to recover the cost in a short time from savings on power consumption. There are some overseas manufacturers of gas engine air conditioners. We will tie up with those producers who can market it here and when it catches on, they can start manufacturing here, said Ranganathan.IGL has called a meeting of leading domestic and multinational producers of gas based power generators to draw up a financing scheme for consumers. More than IGL, it will be producers of gas-based appliances who will benefit from an evolving gas market, said Ranganathan. The cost of power from a diesel-run generator is about Rs19, while a gas based one could produce power for about Rs6-7 a unit.The average piped natural gas (PNG) consumption per household for cooking is about half a cubic meter a day, which translates to a monthly bill of about Rs360.With a target of adding 1.5 lakh customers every year, IGL is spending Rs300 crore this year and another Rs350 crore in the next to add more CNG stations and to lay more pipelines. The oil ministry has a target of raising PNG customers from 39 lakh now in the country to one crore in a few years.With gas consumption going up, IGL may have to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) to meet demand in the future. According to Kalpana Jain, senior director, Deloitte in India, at least in the foreseeable future, the country will remain dependent on imports for gas. For the moment, the going seems to be really good and all the projections seem to suggest that gas price is not going to go through the roof. Going by the investments flowing to construction of LNG import terminals and pipelines, there is a strong case for placing gas as a significant part in our clean energy portfolio, said Jain.",2016-10-13,NsSnxGSh9BcCmCHK3nZQzJ,"Indraprastha Gas , which has 6.5 lakh customers for piped gas in NCR, is trying to create new markets for gas by diversifying into appliances running on the clean fuel",19:15,Indraprastha Gas to introduce CNG-run air conditioners
-0.17,"Shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd rose by around 2.5% in early trading on Wednesday on news that the Telecom Commissions new formula for spectrum usage charge will result in lower costs for some telcos. But by the end of the trading session, the shares gave up more than half of those gains, as it became clear that cost savings will be immaterial. 
				   
				Mint reported earlier this week that Bharti Airtels spectrum usage charge is expected to come down to 3.74% of gross revenue, from 4.9% currently. The cost savings would have been meaningful, although the commission also said that aggregate charges would have to match payments made by telcos in fiscal year 2015-16. In other words, there will be no near-term benefits from the move. From a policy perspective, however, the commissions decisions on spectrum usage charges are heartening. The government is known to eke out maximum revenues from the sector. By capping spectrum usage charges at FY16 levels and agreeing to a lower (3%) charge for future spectrum auctions, there appears to be a slight shift in its stance. Of course, this alone isnt enough to move the needle. Investors in the telecom sector will like to see similar forbearance when it comes to pricing of spectrum in the auctions. Earlier this year, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India recommended an auction of 700 megahertz (MHz) spectrum with a recommended reserve price of $8.5 billion for a 5MHz block. At the time, Kotak Institutional Equities said that bids for 700MHz spectrum would cause irreparable damage to the industry. A company such as Idea Cellular Ltd, for example, would need to pay $4 billion just for its eight leadership circles. This would increase its already high debt levels by over 70%. The government has shown no sign of toning down its expectations. In the budget for 2016-17, it has factored in receipts of Rs.55,000 crore from fresh sale of spectrum. In other words, it expects bids worth more than Rs.2 trillion in the coming auctions in order to receive an upfront payment of Rs.55,000 crore. In the March 2015 auction, telcos had paid around 26.5% of the total value of spectrum as upfront payment. In this backdrop, its clearly premature to read too much into the softening of the governments expectations on spectrum usage charges.",2016-06-09,O2Nd5SwQzirKfm8P9ZSjFO,"It is premature to read too much into the softening of the governments expectations on spectrum usage charges

0.79,"Mumbai: When the Indian government invalidated high-value banknotes on the night of 8 November, taking out 86% of the currency in circulation by value, it was supposed to be a war on unaccounted-for and untaxed wealth, counterfeit notes and terror financing.
				   
				Somewhere along the way, as serpentine queues formed outside bank branches and automated teller machines (ATMs) for days and weeks together, the slogan changed. It became all about promoting a cashless or at least a less-cash culture in an economy where almost 90% of transactions are paid for in cash.The talk turned to technologies such as mobile wallets, crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin, mobile peer-to-peer payments, block chain technology, payment banks and architectures such as the unified payment interface (UPI) and the recently-launched Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) app.The total value of all transactions done using electronic payment systems in India in December rose to Rs105 trillion from Rs95 trillion in November, according to representative data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on 17 January. They included transactions done through the real time gross settlement (RTGS) system, the national electronic funds transfer (NEFT) system, immediate payment service (IMPS), credit cards, debit cards, UPI, point of sale (PoS) terminals and mobile banking.Indeed, the growing popularity and rapid adoption of digital payment systems, in the face of a shortage of cash and stringent limits on bank withdrawals, may be a silver lining to the demonetisation of Rs500 and Rs1,000 notesan exercise that some critics have slammed as ill-conceived and hastily implemented.To be sure, India has a long way go before it joins the ranks of countries such as Sweden, Finland, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, Singapore, France and the UK where more than 85% of the consumer payment transactions are done digitally.But its a start. Consider this. A day after demonetisation, Ola Money, the digital payment solution offered by ride-hailing company Ola, reported an over 1,500% increase in recharges across the 102 cities of its operation. Oxigen Services India Pvt. Ltd, too, claimed to have broken all its previous records in money uploads and transaction count in the week after the demonetisation.Similarly, the National Payments Corporation of Indiathe umbrella organization for all retail payments systems in Indiaclaimed that in just two days (8-9 November), the use of its domestic card schemeRuPayalmost doubled to around 800,000 transactions a day, compared with a daily average of 400,000 transactions earlier (http://bit.ly/2gdu0bW).One97 Communications Ltd-owned digital payments firm Paytm said on 21 November it had seen more than seven million transactions worth Rs120 crore on that day alone. The company claimed that offline, person-to-merchant transactions had grown to contribute over 65% of transactions. Mobile wallet FreeCharge, too, said it had ramped up its acquisition effort and was targeting signing up one million merchants in the coming 12 months.On 16 January, Paytm said it has received a phenomenal response for new service categories such as hospitals, tolls and petrol pumps, and expects to add more categories in the coming months. According to the company, the new categories are generating six million transactions a month and are expected to overtake mobile recharges (in terms of order volumes) by mid-2017. Over the next few months, Paytm will expand to newer categories such as automobile service stations, school and college hostel cafeterias, dairy outlets, apartment maintenance and traffic challans. The company will convert into a payments banks over the next two months, according to a 4 January Press Trust of India report.In a bid to give the country a digital boost, NPCI said its new electronic toll collection (ETC) system would eventually include other vehicle-related payments such as parking fees, servicing and fuel charges (http://bit.ly/2fIv7xf).It was only in September that NPCI launched a pilot project for Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS) with 26 Bharat Bill Payment Operating Units (BBPOUs). Most banks now offer UPI-enabled apps on Google Play Store. To use a UPI-enabled app, you need an Android smartphone, a bank account and a registered mobile number linked to your bank account (http://bit.ly/2eiNqw1).Digital transactions began booming after e-commerce firms such as Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon, Myntra and Jabong began offering attractive discounts to woo customers. Banks accelerated the efforts with their own mobile wallets, mobile banking apps, and pitches of banking on smartwatches and even social networking sites (http://bit.ly/1fucY4s).The launch of Pockets by ICICI Bank Ltd, Lime by Axis Bank Ltd, PayZapp by HDFC Bank Ltd, SBI Buddy by State Bank of India and Ziggit by IDFC Bank Ltd are cases in point.Large telecom services providers such as Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone India Pvt. Ltd, too, have mobile payments solutionsAirtel Money and Vodafone M-Pesa, respectivelytargeted at their own customer base, largely for mobile recharges and remittances. Idea Money from Idea Cellular Ltd, and Jio-Money by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd are other telco-led payment solutions. Airtel, meanwhile, has also announced the launch of its payments bank.Banking in India is witnessing what Nandan Nilekani calls the WhatsApp moment, threatening to disrupt the banking ecosystem in India as payments move to mobile and lending to algorithms. With the launch of UPI, the country has crossed a significant milestone.Apart from making payments easier, UPI enables micro-credit. This will help the currently underserved small traders and businesses. The visibility into transactions provided by UPI apps enables financial institutions to evaluate the credit worthiness of its users. Instead of assets, credit will be based on transaction flow, and can be issued instantaneously. This will provide more choice for borrowers, especially those who depend on moneylenders and the informal sector for loans, says Venkatesh Hariharan, director of Indian Software Products Industry Round Table (iSPIRT)a think tank.Smartphones and increasing Internet penetration will only help Indias digital cause. Around 90% of all devices will be Internet-enabled by 2017, and the number of Internet users will touch 650 million by 2020 from 300 million in 2015, predicts a 25 July report by Google and Boston Consulting Group (BCG). The report forecasts the size of the digital payments industry in India to touch $500 billion by 2020, contributing 15% to Indias gross domestic product (GDP). It also predicts that the non-cash (including cheques, demand drafts, net-banking, credit/debit cards, mobile wallets and UPI) contribution in the consumer payments segment will double to 40% in the same period.Further, while around 30 billion bills worth $103 billion are generated every year, of which 70% are paid in cash, initiatives such as NPCIs BBPS may give a further impetus to the digitization of bill payments.The number of mobile wallet users is already three times the number of credit cards issued in the country (24 million in 2015-16), according to the Google-BCG report.The smartphone explosion in India is expected to usher in this new era in digital payments over the next few years, according to the Google-BCG report.India currently ranks second in the world with more than one billion mobile subscriptions. Of this, around 240 million consumers use smartphones, and this base is projected to increase to over 520 million by 2020.Smartphone subscriptions in the country will increase fourfold to 810 million by 2021, according to the India edition of the Ericsson Mobility Report released on 7 June.The Google-BCG report also highlights that micro-transactions will form a substantial portion of the industry, with more than 50% of the person-to-merchant transactions expected to be under Rs100. It predicts that the value of remittances and money transfer that will pass through alternative digital payment instruments will double to 30% by 2020. A related BCG study (http://bit.ly/2bc0gLk) in August forecasts that by 2020, about 315 million Indians living in rural areas will be connected to the Internet, compared with 120 million now.Globally, too, the payments landscape is seeing heightened activity across multiple categories, ranging from device manufacturers (Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co.), tech firms (Google, eBay Inc., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd), retailers (Starbucks Corp., Wal-Mart Stores Inc.), telecom companies (Vodafone Group Plc., Orange SA) and start-ups (Square Inc., TransferWise Ltd), according to the Google-BCG report.More disruption is expected as the number of fintech start-ups doubled to 1,000 in approximately five years, with funding growing six times to reach $11 billion in 2015.This hockey-stick growth is due to the axis shifting to the customer, who is today served by a variety of competing business models and methods driving its adoption. The explosion in mobile banking is proof enough of how private banks and, later, PSU (public sector undertaking) banks, too, got their act together and worked with start-up fintech firms to rejig their apps, sites and in-house wallets to keep up with customer expectations, rather than trying and do everything by themselves, or waiting for the regulator to issue diktats, says Probir Roy, co-founder and director of digital payments firm Paymate.Hiccups clearly exist.Indians love their cash. Paper currency facilitates making transactions anonymous, helping conceal activities from the government in a way that might help agents avoid laws, regulations and taxes. This is a big difference from most forms of electronic money that, in principle, can be traced by the government, wrote Kenneth Rogoff, Thomas D. Cabot professor of public policy and professor of economics at Harvard University, in an 11 April 2014 paper.This trend is borne out by the fact that retail payments in India, for instance, are still dominated by cash, with a mere 6-7% of transactions conducted electronically. The rest are in cash or cheque.Uber is primarily a cashless service elsewhere in the world, but more than 50% of Uber trips in India are paid for in cash, according to a 10 November blog by Forrester Inc. analyst Ashutosh Sharma.Sharma points out that in India, merchants are forcing the choice of cash payments on customers because electronic payments eat into their marginsjust like everywhere else in the world.Barriers to a cashless world, concurs the World Economic Forum (WEF), include the fact that some merchants still dont want the infrastructure costs and fees associated with electronic payments; some customers still find cash more convenient; access is an issue for individuals without bank accounts; and fraudsters continue to find opportunities in electronic transactions.Consumers who have tried using digital payments but have now shifted to other modes such as cash, card and online banking say the inconvenience of remembering log-in credentials, insufficient acceptance, possibility of a technical or human mistake during a transaction and frequently running out of balance are the top reasons for lapsing, according to the report by Google and BCG. Hence, expanding merchant acceptance is critical to driving mass adoption by consumers.As of 30 September, the number of PoS devices which accept debit and credit cards as modes of payments at merchant outlets was a mere 1.49 million, according to the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBIs) monthly bulletin. Indians had nearly 730 million debit cards and 27 million credit cards at September end, though it isnt clear, however, how many people have more than one card (http://bit.ly/2gc6sFy). Moreover, most Indians use debit cards to withdraw cash from ATMs.According to Roy, a cashless economy has to have appeal and practicality at the most elementary level for consumers and merchants alike, especially given the plethora of overlapping and competing payment options.There are great apps for mobile banking, money transfer, shop and pay, tap and go, etc., and then there are the old faithful viz. net banking, prepaid cards, IMPS and e-wallets, USSD (unstructured supplementary service data) and UPI. The latter (USSD and UPI), yet to quite reach their WhatsApp moment, saddled as it is by the way banks have implemented, and promoting them vis-a-vis other offerings, lack of a people-friendly branding and a common user interface, explains Roy.Roy cites the example of a food court in a mall where you load your food court plastic card, redeem at food stalls on par and cash out the balance when done.Security is another big concern. According to cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab, while those who have been transacting online are fairly well-versed with the threats one can face while paying online, its the first-time users or new adaptors that need to be educated on the risks they are exposed to.According to Altaf Halde, managing director (South Asia), Kaspersky Lab, while payments through smartphones are very convenient and frees one of the pressures to hold cash, it calls for precautions. One small slip-up can cause one a huge loss. While companies are bound by law to follow guidelines, fraudsters find their way through many security barricades. The only way to safeguard oneself, in such a scenario, is to be vigilant while paying and to keep the mobile protected with a security plan. With these two simple steps, people can ward off almost all financial theft risks. As the current adjustment period makes way for settlement, we are sure that more people, across economic strata, will find digital payments way more convenient and may make it their preferred mode of payment, says Halde.Being an online security firm, Kasperky Lab recommends that users should get themselves a mobile security plan.Moreover, interoperability issues are causing friction between banks and mobile wallet service providers.On 16 January, for instance, Mint reported that ICICI Bank Ltd had blocked transactions on payments app PhonePe in at least the second such instance of a commercial bank trying to protect its turf against non-bank mobile wallet and payment companies.PhonePe is a UPI app.A day later, PhonePes co-founder and chief executive officer Sameer Nigam took to microblogging site Twitter to allege that ICICI was blocking transactions since Friday (http://bit.ly/2jlYhGX).ICICI Bank cited security concerns as its reason for blocking PhonePe. NPCI initially ordered ICICI Bank to rectify the situation. Later, in a U-turn, it said PhonePe is in violation of UPI norms (http://bit.ly/2iT5Q3F)On 4 January, CNBC-TV18 reported that SBI had blocked net-banking transactions with e-wallet firms, although it allowed customers to top up their mobile wallets with debit and credit cards.At the time, SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya said the service was blocked because of security concerns.Roy insists that an open-access platform allows for interoperability for wallets operators, and diverse choice for customers. This will allow banks to have a wider acceptability of popular third-party prepaid cards and wallets, with minimal loading failure rates.Second, it will enable them to, inter alia, inter-operate seamlessly and with minimal friction across a multi-sided base comprising e.wallets, banks and common merchants (same QR code for instance).Third, banks will have to rework service level agreements with their PoS merchants and card networks to ensure a much higher reliability.In conclusion, says Roy, India is too large a country, diverse in its perceptions, behaviours and idiosyncrasies to have a one-size-fits-all strategy for a post-cash world.",2017-01-27,ODcuu2wmWqGWNUY6wHhmmJ,The rapid adoption of digital payment systems is seen as a potential silver lining to the exercise that caused a widespread cash crunch thats only now beginning to ease,01:27,Indias cash conundrum: how ready is India to go cashless?
0.23,"New Delhi: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has received the delivery of the worlds first very large ethane carrying ships that will be used for ferrying the fuel from the US.
				   
				Reliance had in 2014 ordered building of six Very Large Ethane Carriers (VLECs) at Samsung Heavy Industries Pvt. Ltd shipyards in Korea. The vessels are the first to feature new membrane technology from French specialist Gaztransport & Technigaz SA(GTT), considered key to the execution of the project.With a capacity of 87,000 cubic meters, the two vessels are the largest ethane carriers built to date.In a ceremony held in Geoje (South Korea), RIL inaugurated its very first two VLECs, GTT said in a statement.The two vessels, named Ethane Crystal and Ethane Emerald, are the first in a series of six VLECs ordered by RIL in 2014.Japans biggest shipping company Mitsui OSK Lines Pvt. Ltd will manage and operate the ships for RIL.Ethane, a natural gas component, is expected to be produced in large volumes in North America due to the shale gas revolution, which has generated an abundance of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Ethane is primarily used as a petrochemical feedstock to produce ethylene by steam cracking.RIL plans to ship 1.5 million tonnes a year of ethane from its US shale joint ventures to its chemical complex in Gujarat. The firm has two joint ventures (JVs) in Pennsylvanias Marcellus Shaleone with Chevron Corp., in which it has invested $1.7 billion, and another with Houston-based Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc., in which it has invested $392 million. It has a third JV, in which it invested $1.5 billion, in Texas Eagle Ford Shale group with Dallas-based Pioneer Natural Resources Co.The worlds richest energy billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led RILs business spans petrochemicals, exploration and production, retail and telecommunications. As per the original contract, Samsung was to deliver the ships to be used for ethane transportation, from October 2016 to January 2017. Each ship is priced at $120 million.VLECs are a hybrid of LNG and LPG carriers. Due to the expectation of competitively priced ethane as opposed to naphtha, a crude oil byproduct, petrochemical producers are hoping to lower their production costs by using ethane.The VLECs are to transport liquefied ethane from the US to the Dahej terminal in Gujarat, which will be used to supply feedstock for RILs crackers in Dahej, Hazira and Nagothane.RIL has an ethane supply contract in place with Enterprise Product Partners out of their Morgans Point terminal in the US Gulf, which exported its first ethane cargo in September on a 27,500 cubic meter vessel for Ineos.Earlier this week, RIL had stated that it has secured a $573 million of loan for part-financing of the vessel construction costs.",2016-10-28,OGRgM8F15eacBFWFH19ugP,"The two vessels, named Ethane Crystal and Ethane Emerald, are the first in a series of six Very Large Ethane Carriers ordered by RIL in 2014",20:22,RIL gets worlds first very large ethane-carrying ships
0.14,"If you ever thought that Global Positioning System, or GPS, is the only technology used to develop navigation systems and give directions, you may want to think again.
				   
				A team of researchers at the University of California-Riverside (UCR) has developed a highly reliable and accurate navigation system that exploits existing environmental signals such as cellular and Wi-Fi rather than GPS.Most navigation systems in cars and portable electronics use the space-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), which includes the US system GPS, Russian system GLONASS, European system Galileo, and Chinese system BeiDou. For precision technologies such as aerospace and missiles, navigation systems typically combine GPS with a high-quality on-board Inertial Navigation System (INS), which delivers a high level of short-term accuracy but eventually drifts when it loses touch with external signals, the UCR researchers point out.However, GPS signals alone are very weak and unusable in certain environments like deep canyons. Second, GPS signals are susceptible to intentional and unintentional jamming and interference. Third, civilian GPS signals are unencrypted, unauthenticated, and specified in publicly available documents, making them spoofable, or prone to hacking, the researchers say. Hence, current trends in autonomous vehicle navigation systems rely not only on GPS/INS, but a suite of other sensor-based technologies such as cameras, lasers, and sonar. By adding more and more sensors, researchers are throwing everything but the kitchen sink to prepare autonomous vehicle navigation systems for the inevitable scenario that GPS signals become unavailable. We took a different approach, which is to exploit signals that are already out there in the environment, said Zak Kassas, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering in UCRs Bourns College of Engineering, in a 13 October statement. He led the team that presented its research (bit.ly/2dYsBUm) at the 2016 Institute of Navigation Global Navigation Satellite System Conference (ION GNSS+), in Portland, Oregon, last month.Instead of adding more internal sensors, Kassas and his team in UCRs Autonomous Systems Perception, Intelligence, and Navigation (ASPIN) Laboratory have been developing autonomous vehicles that could tap into the hundreds of signals around us at any point in time, like cellular, radio, television, Wi-Fi, and other satellite signals.In the research presented at the ION GNSS+ Conference, Kassas team showcased ongoing research that exploits these existing communications signals, called signals of opportunity (SOP) for navigation. The system can be used by itself, or, more likely, to supplement INS data in the event that GPS fails.The teams research approach includes theoretical analysis of SOPs in the environment, building specialized software-defined radios (SDRs) that will extract relevant timing and positioning information from SOPs, developing practical navigation algorithms, and finally testing the system on ground vehicles and unmanned drones.While GPS is a good outdoor location technology, it is unreliable indoors. However, the idea to supplement GPS with other technologies for indoor location use with widely-used location technologies including Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity), Li-FI (light fidelity), Beacons and NFC (near field communication) is not entirely new.Technologies like Beacons (such as Apple Inc.s iBeacon) are low-cost, low-powered transmitters equipped with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) that can be used to deliver proximity-based, context-aware messages. They are ideal for detecting smartphones indoors, where GPS isnt always effective, and can communicate with apps on devices when they are indoors. NFC requires users to pull out their phones and tap onto a NFC reader, thus requiring investments in tags, readers, etc. The range, however, is limited to 20cm and less. Beacons, on the other hand, typically have a wireless range of 1m to 70m but being radio transmitters, they too are susceptible to interference. Skyhook Wireless Inc. has a Wi-Fi-based location system, which it calls Wi-Fi Positioning System (WPS). Skyhooks patented Precision Location combines Wi-Fi with GPS, cell towers, IP (Internet protocol) address and device sensors to provide positioning for any device on any operating system (OS).Li-Fi is another option. Almost four years back, Harald Haas, who was then professor of mobile communications at the University of Edinburgh and the person who coined the term Li-Fi. and Gordon Povey, now chief executive at Trisent, claimed that Li-Fi broadband can replace GPS (bit.ly/2dbiQ6A).Haas, now co-founder and interim chief executive officer of pureLifia spin-out from the University of Edinburghbelieves that light fidelity (Li-Fi)-enabled LED light bulbs can also transmit data much faster than Wi-Fi (bit.ly/1Tn7rPM). According to a 2012 report in UK-based newspaper Independent (ind.pn/2e1Hoga), Li-Fi promised to challenge the dominance of GPS with Li-Fi LED bulbs so long as we are in the line of sight of the light source.",2016-10-26,OSfcc6xwRWg0Bd8pW6vAmM,Researchers at University of California-Riverside develop highly reliable and accurate navigation system that exploits existing environmental signals,00:10,"What happens when GPS fails?

0.25,"Ten days ago, L Catterton, the result of a merger between the private equity (PE) and real estate funds of LVMH Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessey SE, held its annual summit in New Delhi. L Capital, as the PE unit of LVMH used to be known, has invested in Fabindia, PVR and Genesis Luxury (it has exited from the first two). 
				   
				Ravi Thakran, managing partner and chairman of L Catterton Asia, known for his insightful understanding of the luxury and consumer goods markets of Asia, who was in the national capital for the summit, spoke to Mint about the urgent need to invest in Indian artisanal luxury. Thakrans belief that L Catterton could become a change agent in the arts and crafts sector given the right conditions may be a big idea whose time has come. He also argues why the Indian governments development agenda should include local luxury. How would you describe your experience of investing in and working with Indian companies? Any thoughts about the work culture here? I firmly believe that India has a long and credible history of entrepreneurship, which is manifest in many success stories across sectors. This story is only getting stronger, and it is encouraging to see new business ideas coming to fruition from first generation entrepreneurs, and a changing mindset within the old business families too. There have been various issues, such as policy certainty on the one hand, poor infrastructure on another and costly real estate, etc. that have been inhibitors to even higher growth. We are pleased at the progress being made by the current government in addressing some of these. Of course, we would all hope for faster progress on some of these fronts. Lastly, the one big issue impacting investments has been concerns around governance and transparency. Thankfully, the incidence is reducing, but as investors, one cant overemphasize the importance of entrepreneur selection. Has the merger of L Capital and L Catterton changed the companys essential parameters for choosing luxury, apparel or consumer brands to invest in? We have and will continue to be focused on the key consumer categories that appeal to the vast and growing middle class across Asia. Of course, with the combination, we benefit from a much longer experience base and wider global reach and insights. As Asia develops, some categories that were hitherto nascent in the Asian context, but relevant in North America, such as pet foods, health and fitness, etc., are now gaining traction. You have invested in Bateel dates in Dubai. There could be numerous such small potential parallels in the food business in India. Does anything particular from Kerala to Kashmir currently interest you?Given Indias vast and diverse food history, there clearly are a number of interesting food businesses that can be interesting globally. Some segments like Darjeeling tea are fairly obvious, but the key is to make the transition from a generic provenance to more distinctive branding. A related example that I could quote is the success that Fabindias subsidiary Organic India has had with commercialization of tulsi (a kind of basil ). Organic products and wellness products created from Ayurvedic or herbal ingredients are a part of Indias culture. Yet, no such brand has become a leading global name. What could be the reasons?I would not agree that India has had no success in this arena, with Himalaya being a very obvious example. Of course, if you look at the more premium segments of the global market, one would agree that no Indian business has been able to make a meaningful dent thus far. This is in part driven by the dynamics within the local market, in terms of price points, etc., which have an impact on how companies think about things like packaging, route to market and marketing, etc. But the more premium end of the market is now taking shape. Be it brands like Kama Ayurveda or Forest Essentials, these companies have clearly approached the opportunity differently and some of them will be able to evolve into brands that are relevant globally. Which is the most unusual and unexpected portfolio company L Catterton chose to work with anywhere in the world or in Asia? I am not sure if I would use the terminology unusual or unexpected, because as long-term, sector-focused investors, we only invest after a rigorous and detailed study of any investment. That being said, when we invested in PVR in India in 2012, it was our first investment in the media space, let alone the multiplex business. While not very obvious, we could clearly see that the company could benefit from our involvement, which as you can see from its success since, has clearly played out. Be it in helping the company grow inorganically, enhancing its digital interface and share of e-ticketing revenues, to increasing the contribution of non-ticket revenues, there have been multiple areas where we were able to contribute to their success. What do you think about luxury in India?India perhaps has the most evolved luxury products of the world. Whether they are from the glass industry of Firozabad or the perfumes of Kannaujwe should take pride in the diversity. There is a long list of Indian creations that symbolize cultural elegance as well as are a statement of worth and status without any logos. Wearing Indian luxury is the best way to say I am here to be myself, not to espouse a logo. That is the ultimate definition of luxury and the entire world is now moving towards embracing it. Take for instance, the white cotton dhoti with a gold border. It respects culture, is innovative, understated, has a name, is classic and yet can be so contemporary. While earlier many of these artisanal creations survived under the patronage of royalty, later due to various supply chain issues, the value of our craftsmen went down. We have the capacity to leapfrog but nobody is talking about building global luxury from India. The development agenda of the current government must make this a priority. India must wake up. I genuinely hope that luxury because of its labelling is not seen as elitist and kept aside. Look at how the Chinese build billion-dollar brands. We need to make that happen in India. Enriching craftsmen is a national responsibility.Did L Capital ever make an effort in the past to step in and create global brands out of Indian crafts and arts?We have been continuously exploring how to somehow provide the route or become the route to marketing this extraordinary luxury of India. In fact, a couple of years back, we tried to collaborate with a Kolkata designer who I would not like to name but someone who we believed could lead the project and curate products from 14-15 well known and significant weaving states of India and build them as a brand. Somehow it did not work out then.Will you revive that plan? Are you still looking for a design leader who can curate art and crafts brands for strategic brand building?Of course! This is my clarion call to anyone out there who deserves and commits to a curating leadership role. Craftsmen struggle to find platforms and at L Catterton we want to become that platform.

-0.92,"London/New York: Millions of internet users lost access to some of the worlds most popular websites on Friday, as hackers hammered servers along the US East Coast with phony traffic until they crashed, then moved westward.
				   
				A global attack on one provider of Domain Name System services, Dyn Inc., took down sites including Twitter, Spotify, Reddit, CNN, Etsy and The New York Times for long stretches of time  from New York to Los Angeles.Kyle York, chief strategy officer of Dyn, said the hackers launched a so-called distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack using tens of millions of malware-infected devices connected to the internet. Speaking during a conference call on Friday afternoon, York said Dyn was actively dealing with a third wave of the attack.By Friday evening, Dyn said it had stopped the hacks. As you can imagine it has been a crazy day, Dyn spokesman Adam Coughlin wrote in an e-mail. At this moment (knock on wood) service has been restored.Security professionals have been anticipating a rise in attacks coming from malware that targets the Internet of Things, a new breed of small gadgets that are connected to the internet. That was after a hacker released software code that powers such malware, called Mirai, several weeks ago.Gillian M. Christensen, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said the agency and the FBI are aware of the incidents and investigating all potential causes.Internet havocDyn first reported site outages relating to the DDoS attack at around 7:10am New York time. The company restored service two hours later but was offline again at around noon, as another attack appeared to be underway, this time affecting the West Coast as well.While DDoS attacks dont steal anything, they create havoc across the internet -- and are on the rise in volume and power.Earlier in the day, Brian Krebs, a well-known journalist covering computer security, wrote that the timing of the attacks corresponded with the release of research conducted by Dyns director of internet analysis. Dyn highlighted potential connections between firms that offer to protect against DDoS attacks, and the hackers who conduct them. Krebss own website faced an extremely large and unusual DDoS attack after he published a story based on the same research, he said.We cant confirm or even speculate on anyones motivation or relation to that research, said Dave Allen, Dyns general counsel.Common warfareWith attacks on the internets Domain Name System, hackers compromise the underlying technology that governs how the web functions, making the hack far more powerful and widespread.The DNS translates website names into the Internet Protocol addresses that computers use to look up and access sites. But it has a design flaw: Sending a routine data request to a DNS server from one computer, the hacker can trick the system into sending a monster file of IP addresses back to the intended target. Multiply that by tens of thousands of computers under the hackers control, and the wall of data that flooded back is enormous. A small server may be capable of handling hundreds of simultaneous requests, but thousands every minute cause overload and ultimately shut down, taking the websites it hosts offline with it.The practice often is employed by groups of hackers. In 2012, a DDoS attack forced offline the websites of Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., U.S. Bancorp and PNC Financial Services Group Inc.A DDoS can be achieved in a number of ways, but commonly involves a distributed network of so-called zombie machines, referred to as botnets. A botnet is formed with computers and other connected devices in homes or offices infected with malicious code which, upon the request of a hacker, can flood a web server with data. One or two machines wouldnt be an issue, but if tens or hundreds of thousands fire such data simultaneously, it can cripple even the most sophisticated web servers.In the case of the Dyn incident, the computers targeted were DNS servers. Without a DNS server, large numbers of websites are inaccessible by users across a country or even the world. In other words, taking away the DNS servers is like taking away all the road signs on a countrys highway system. Single company targetedSo-called authoritative DNS providers like Dyn are notoriously hard to secure. Carl Herberger, vice president for security solutions at Radware, an Israeli-based internet security company, likens authoritative DNS providers to hospitals, which must admit anyone who shows up at the emergency room. Dyn must consider traffic going to a website as initially legitimate. In the event of a DDoS, Dyn must work quickly to sort out the bad traffic from the good, which takes time and resources, and creates outages that ripple across the internet, as was the case Friday.Dave Palmer, director of technology at UK cybersecurity company Darktrace, said the most recent DDoS attacks have been linked to Internet of Things devices, in particular web cams.The joke about the Internet of Things was that you were going to get people hijacking peoples connected fridges to conduct these attacks, but in these recent cases the culprit seems to be webcams, Palmer said. We will probably see, when this is investigated, that it is a botnet of the Internet of Things.To avoid massive outages, companies ramp up their capacity to try to absorb the deluge of traffic and reroute it, often with the help of a major telecommunications carrier or cloud-services provider like Akamai Technologies Inc. and CloudFlare Inc. But the only way to really prevent denial-of-service attacks may be to increase the overall security level of consumers around the world, Palmer said, a task that is getting harder as more and more devices are connected to the Internet.This is exactly what happens when tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of devices are left unprotected, Palmer said.

0.45,"Beijing: Terming Prime Minister Narendra Modis decision to demonetize high value currency notes as startling and bold, Chinese official media has said it is far from enough and India may look at ideas from Chinas crackdown against corruption which has shown efficiency. 
				   
				Modi in a startling and sudden move demonetized Rs500 and Rs1,000 currency notes to demonstrate that he is truly up for a fiercer fight against black money and corruption, an op-ed article in the state-run Global Times said. Modi means well and his decision was made based on the reality in India, since most illegal business in the underground economy is cash-only, and Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes constitute over 80% of all cash circulation in India. Nevertheless, we can hardly count on the new rule to fully root out corruption, stated the article titled Beijing offers clues for Modis new anti-corruption moves. Since Modi assumed office, he has carried out a number of measures to crack down on black money, corruption and tax evasion. However, many of them are believed to be without teeth and cant begin to scratch the surface of the problems he faces, it said. Indias new policy to scrap high value notes is considered a risky, but a bold and decisive step, it said. And yet, delivering a corruption-free country requires more than banning currency notes. The key should be reforming systems. In this regard, New Delhi might need to look for ideas from Beijing, it said, referring to the massive anti- graft campaign carried out by President Xi Jinping in which over a million officials at different levels were punished. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party in 2012, during which Xi was elected as its general secretary, and taking over as the president and military chief launched the anti-graft campaign which also attracted criticism that he used it effectively to consolidate his power emerging as the most powerful Chinese leader after party founder Mao Zedong. Over the years, China promoted anti-corruption laws, improved the supervision system, deepened judicial system reforms and adopted measures to make sure the system is transparent, it said without referring to criticism about the campaign. For instance, Chinas foreign ministry has lately published information about the families of 12 senior officials on its website in an effort to fight against corruption through familial networks by improving transparency. These steps are taken to ensure that achievements made in the struggle against corruption can be consolidated by laws and systems, it said. China is still on its way toward building a comprehensive anti-corruption system. But compared with India, Beijings method has already shown its efficiency, it said. More time is needed to see whether Modis new policy will turn into a huge blow against corruption in India. The hard truth is that the corrupt and fraudulent wont just conduct shady deals by using cash, but with gold, real estate and overseas assets. Corruption can be bred in a variety of ways. Blocking the circulation of large currency bills is without question far from enough, it said.

0.51,"Reliance Communications Ltd (R-Com) is acquiring Sistema Shyam Teleservices Ltds wireless business for equity worth Rs.2,100 crore. It has also committed to paying Sistemas liabilities to the government, the present value of which is Rs.2,400 crore. 
				   
				These look like extremely high valuations for Sistemas loss-making operations, and the deal will only make sense if R-Com can monetize the spectrum assets through a favourable arrangement with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. R-Com has paid three times Sistemas annual revenues of Rs.1,500 crore. This is much higher than Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltds enterprise value to sales valuation of around 2.2 times. While these companies have operating profit margins of over 30%, Sistema reported operating losses were well over 30% of its revenues. Even if R-Com extracts all synergies possible and improves Sistemas operating profit to 30%a far crythe valuation still looks unpalatable at 10 times, far higher than 6-7 times EV/Ebitda valuation of incumbents. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. But Sistema holds 800 mega Hertz (MHz) spectrum in eight key circles, which can be extremely valuable for Reliance Jio. It will help in launching its LTE services, including voice over LTE, with much wider coverage, vis-a-vis spectrum in higher frequency bands.Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients, We see this transaction as just a precursor to a much larger transaction involving R-Com and R-Jio. We note that there is very little circle overlap between the liberalized 800MHz spectrum holdings of R-Jio and MTS (Sistema). Of the 10 circles in which Reliance Jio has 800MHz spectrum, six are in so-called C-level circles, which are the least lucrative in terms of revenue potential. Sistema holds spectrum in lucrative circles such as Delhi, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kolkata. Based on the discovered prices in this years auction (and using the reserve price in circles where there werent any bids), Sistemas spectrum in these eight circles is worth Rs.7,955 crore. Not all of this will necessarily flow into R-Coms books, even if Reliance Jio agrees to the price. This is because the governments spectrum-trading guidelines includes a clause that states that for any spectrum acquired in the March 2013 auction (such as Sistemas), trading will be permitted only if the price differential vis-a-vis the latest auction price is paid. The spectrum was acquired for Rs.3,639 crore, which means a differential of Rs.4,316 crore will need to be paid before this spectrum can be traded. Sistema has challenged this clause in the courts, and if it wins, R-Com will make it an additional payment of $300 million (approximately Rs.2,000 crore), according to a Sistema spokesman. R-Coms statement states, An appropriate payment/earn-out mechanism has been agreed in relation to disputed spectrum contiguity charges claimed by DoT. On the other hand, if the department of telecoms claim is upheld, Sistema will bear no liability. In either case, R-Com can only hope to recoup these additional costs when it sells the spectrum eventually to Reliance-Jio. All told, much depends on the outcome of this case. More depends on how much Reliance Jio is willing to cough up for spectrum in these eight circles. Doubtless, it will seek to tweak its outgo depending on R-Coms effective cost. R-Com chairman Anil Ambanis comments at the companys annual meeting suggested that a deal with Reliance-Jio is imminent. R-Coms market capitalization has risen by Rs.4,400 crore since then. Its doubtful Reliance-Jio will leave so much on the table, especially considering the fact that its capex has already reached unusually high levels. Investors should tone down their expectations.

0.2,"The price of lead has suddenly surged by about 12% from its low in end-January. If the trend continues, it could be very discomforting for battery manufacturers. Any rise in the price of lead, the key input for making batteries, pulls down operating margins of these companies, unless of course, it is passed on to customers.
				   
				But currently, it seems rather difficult for manufacturers to hike battery prices. The reason is weak demand for automotive batteries in the replacement market, where profit margins are far higher than for the original equipment supplies. Cut-throat competition between two market leaders Exide Industries Ltd and Amara Raja Batteries Ltd would make a price hike difficult. And then, there is the unorganized battery manufacturing segment too that competes in the replacement market.In fact, in its December quarter results media release, market leader Exide Industries had said that there was no significant improvement in demand for the automotive original equipment (OE) and industrial battery, including demand for inverter as well as power, telecom and solar batteries. The last four quarters performance shows that Exide Industries revenue stagnated, whereas Amara Rajas was erratic.Has profitability peaked then for the two listed entities and market leaders? Exide Industries December quarter operating margin at 15.4% was the best in many years. Likewise, Amara Raja delivered a power-packed 232 basis point year-on-year jump in operating margin. But most of this came on the back of plummeting lead prices that hit the abyss in the latter part of calendar year 2015. For instance, Exide Industries raw material cost was 400 basis points lower year-on-year. A basis point is 0.01%.Now, the reversal in lead prices and subdued demand growth in automotive replacement battery sales will weigh on profit margins, albeit with a lag. This could hurt investor sentiment that has been highly optimistic for several quarters. Besides, stocks of both these companies have rallied and valuations, which range between 20 and 25 times one-year forward estimated earnings per share, arent cheap.The only ray of hope is that truck sales have been robust for about two years. A revival of truck battery sales in the replacement market could add to volumes and help offset, at least partially, the rise in raw material costs.",2016-03-17,P5HzBQbnQtCcwWvckC42eJ,"The price of lead has suddenly surged by about 12% from its low in end-January.

0.05,"Mumbai: Running a marathon is a metaphor for Natarajan Chandrasekarans career. 
				   
				Twice over.In Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), a business he will lead until 21 February, Chandra, as he is popularly known, has spent almost 30 years, his entire working life.He started as a software programmer with TCS in 1987 and rose through the ranks to become one of the youngest chief executive officers (CEOs) in Tata group when he was 46 years old in 2009.Now, as he prepares to take over as chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, Chandrasekaran is in effect getting ready to run another marathon.He is 53 and the retirement age for top Tata executives is 70, giving him a potential 17 years at the helm of the $103-billion group that has businesses ranging from salt to steel and tea to telecom.Running a marathon is also a metaphor for running a business, according to Chandrasekaran.You have to decide on the length of the engagement, develop endurance to handle setbacks and increase speed when the competition demands it, Chandrasekaran said in an interview to Runners World magazine in October 2015 (bit.ly/2iFOCtK).You have to perform with your heart and your mind; you will not get lost on the way if you have a good road map; you will get nowhere without discipline. This is what I always tell my employees in speeches, he said.He will start running his new marathon at a time when Tata group is in the midst of a bruising battle with its former chairman, Cyrus Mistry, who was sacked on 24 October in a boardroom putsch, less than four years after he succeeded family scion Ratan Tata.Also read: Tata vs Mistry: NCLT dismisses contempt of court plea filed by Mistry firmsThe feud between Mistry, who has accused the 149-year old business house of a variety of corporate governance violations, and Tata has reached the National Company Law Tribunal, or NCLT, where a long and messy legal battle is looming.The Mistry family is the largest minority shareholder in Tata Sons, the holding company of the group.We are at an inflection point, Chandrasekaran wrote in an emailed statement after his appointment. I am aware that this role comes with huge responsibilities. It will be my endeavour to help progress the group with the ethos, ethics and values that the Tata group has been built on.A Tata Sons spokesperson said the chairman-designate was not available for interviews immediately.Chandrasekaran, we believe will now inspire the entire Tata group to realize its potential acting as leaders in their respective businesses, always in keeping with our value system and ethics and adhering with the practices of the Tata group which have stood it in good stead, the Tata Sons board said in a statement on 12 January while announcing his elevation. The five-member selection committee chose him unanimously, it added.Also read: Tata Sons new chairman has twin obstaclesa family and a conglomerateChandrasekaran would be no stranger to the value systems and the practices that the board is talking about. The man who would have been a farmer joined the company after completing his Masters degree in computer applications from the Regional Engineering College in Trichy, Tamil Nadu. Over time, he has worked in a variety of positions (chief operating officer, executive assistant to S. Ramadorai, the previous CEO), and places (California and Stockholm). In that sense, he is an insider.He is an outsider because he is the first truly professional chairman of the Tata Sons board who is not related to the Tata family.Nowroji Saklatwala, the third chairman of the group, was the nephew of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of Tata group. Cyrus Mistry is the brother-in-law of Noel Tata, half brother of Ratan Tata.This can be interpreted in two ways: Either the Tatas chose a safe option by choosing an insider, or the group took a step forward to regain its tarnished credibility by choosing a non-family memberand one with a proven track recordto lead the firm.Also read: N. Chandrasekaran begins long road to restoring Tata groups imageIndeed, Chandrasekarans first task will be to restore the reputation of the group and the sheen of brand Tata.A day after his ouster, Mistry (in a letter that subsequently found its way into the public domain) said the Tata group was beset with a host of corporate governance issues.The group was staring at a potential $18-billion write-down, he claimed. It persisted with a loss-making project, the Nano small car, because it was an obsession with Ratan Tata; there was undue interference from some of the trustees of the Tata Trusts, which own two-thirds of Tata Sons; some friends and associates of Ratan Tata benefited from Tata group contractsthey all were a part of Mistrys lists of allegations.Subsequently, the listed companies of the Tata group lost 6.1% (till 16 January) of their market capitalization, and regulators began asking questions.The controversy at Tata group is not his (Chandrasekarans) creation. He just needs to ride it out. I think if he can build a reasonably supportive relationship with Cyrus, it will be good for the image of corporate India, said Ganesh Natarajan, vice-chairman at Zensar Technologies Ltd, who has worked with Chandrasekaran at software industry lobby Nasscom.Restoring the reputation is just a start. The fact remains that the Tata group has several underperformers. The so-called legacy hot spots which were named by MistryTata Power Co. Ltds Mundra plant in western Gujarat, Tata Steel Europe, Indian Hotels Co. Ltd, Tata Teleservices Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd passenger vehiclesall are pressure points.For instance, in the four years to fiscal 2016, Tata Steel has taken an impairment charge of at least Rs24,175 crore, most of it attributed to the European assets that it acquired with the 2007 purchase of Corus Group Plc for £6.7 billion (Rs54,000 crore today).In the past fiscal, losses at Coastal Gujarat Power Ltd (CGPL), which houses the Mundra plant, were Rs1,491.86 crore.Looking at data aggregated between 2011 and 2015 and limit the analysis largely to the legacy hot spots, it will show that the capital employed in those companies has risen from Rs1.32 trillion to Rs1.96 trillion A realistic assessment of the fair value of these businesses could potentially result in a write-down over time of Rs1.18 trillion, Mistry pointed out in his letter.But it wont be easy to rejuvenate these businesses. Selling or exiting them wont be a quick option since it will call into question the business wisdom and legacy of group patriarch Ratan Tata.Look at Tata Steel. Corus is a disaster, said T.V. Mohandas Pai, chairman of Manipal Global Education and former board of director at Infosys Ltd. Cyrus tried to change that by selling assets, but they ousted him as they said it was against Tata values, said Pai.Tata values, he said, cannot be based on destruction of shareholders value.Pai terms Chandrasekaran as a go getter who is great at marketing and building relationships, but he is not sure if he will get the much-needed free hand to run Tata Sons.Once he takes charge at Tata Sons, the key issue wont be whether he will be able to do well, but whether he will have operational freedom, he said.This talk of freedom to operate that Pai is talking about goes to the crux of Mistrys accusations.Mistry, in his 25 October letter, said he had been reduced to the position of a lame duck chairman.He accused Tata Trusts and some of the trusteesRatan Tata and Noshir Soonawala, in particularof excessive interference in the running of listed Tata companies.Documents filed by the Mistry family firmsCyrus Investments Pvt. Ltd and Sterling Investments Pvt. Ltdin NCLT alleged mismanagement of Tata Sons and oppression of minority shareholders, cited some examples and called them shadow directors.These charges have been strongly refuted by Tata and Soonawala in affidavits they filed in reply.Also read: Why Natarajan Chandrasekaran is a safe choice for Ratan TataLeaving this issue aside, Chandrasekaran will anyway have to establish a good working relationship with the principal shareholders of Tata Sons, both in terms of navigating the three-tier structure of the groupTata Trusts, Tata Sons and Tata group operating companiesand in meeting their expectations.Already, the trustees have come out with statements highlighting their concerns.The new leadership at Tata Sons should ensure that the overall profitability and income of the group improves, and the dividend payout by Tata Sons to Tata Trusts not only stabilizes but also increases, said V.R. Mehta, a trustee of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, in an interview, a day after Chandrasekarans elevation was announced.The main worry of the trust was the decline in the dividend income of Tata Sons from the operating companies, he said.In a 10 November statement, Tata Sons had pointed out that with the exception of TCS, all 40 other firms (many non-dividend paying) in its portfolio paid dividends that have continuously declined from Rs1,000 crore in 2012-13 to Rs780 crore in 2015-16.It said even the Rs780-crore figure included an interim dividend of Rs100 crore, which would have been normally received in 2016-17. Shriram Subramanian, managing director at InGovern Reearch, a proxy advisory firm, says while Chandrasekarans capabilities are beyond doubt, he needs to ensure that better corporate governance practices prevail in the group, and he is not seen as a yes man to Ratan Tata.Also read: Chandras true test will be shutting down Tatas loss-making businesses: Aswath DamodaranIn TCS at least, Chandrasekaran has proven to be his own man as can be seen from the 2008 reorganization of the software firm into five groups, whose directors began reporting directly to him.But the challenges will be different now, when it comes to dealing with other group CEOs, many of them his peers.To some extent, Chandra will also be constrained by not having the experience of having dealt with huge debt and with bankers, said Subramanian.TCS has been the cash cow of Tata group. It accounts for around 17.5% of the total revenue of the conglomerate. It is the company which spews cash to fund Tata ventures into newer businesses, allowing Tata Sons to act like a private equity investor.Chandrasekarans role so far has been to keep it running smoothly and build on the gains made previously; under him, TCSs market capitalization and revenues grew more than three times. But now, he needs to figure out ways to replicate his success with TCS in unfamiliar businesses.The culture in the IT (information technology) industry is one of youthful exuberance, service orientation, technological innovation and collaborative learningan antithesis to the rough and tough shop-floor realities of old-world industries, wrote Prabal Basu Roy, a Sloan Fellow from the London Business School and a chartered accountant, in a column on 14 January. Therefore, this cultural and skill set mismatch will be a major challengethough charismatic leadership can overcome some of this.But such concerns are brushed aside by Tata insiders.Also read: The many challenges of Natarajan ChandrasekaranIf the group chairman knows everything, it will create over dependence and everyone would look upon him rather than doing it on their own, said K. Santhanakrishnan, non-executive and non-independent director at Tata Global Beverages Ltd. The group needs his soft skills. The hardware already exists in the form of professionally managed boards and professional executive management. His experience in the software industry which has linkages with all the sectors and his wide international exposure and acceptability across, would really help the group.Chandrasekaran takes charge at a time when the group needs a strategic reorientation. With the election of Donald Trump, who has vowed to protect American jobs, as US President and the shift in customers spending patterns from traditional IT services to a digital domain, TCS itself is going to face tough times and may not be able to sustain its dividend track record.At the same time, tough calls have to be made to bring down group debt, which stands at Rs2.25 trillion, and which new businesses to focus on.The reactions I get to my philosophy are heartwarming. No less than a thousand employees responded to my call to run the Mumbai Marathon together, Chandrasekaran said in the Runners World interview.To succeed in his new job and successfully complete the metaphorical marathon he is embarking on, he will need a similar response from the 660,000 employees of Tata group.",2017-01-20,PUT0dMs7Buh2WJTdbafJzM,MintAsia examines the challenges Natarajan Chandrasekaran faces  as he prepares to take the helm at Tata Sons at a time when the group is engaged in an ugly feud with its ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry,01:26,Marathon Man

0.45,"New Delhi/Mumbai: Consolidation in Indias $27 billion telecom industry received a massive boost with Vodafone Group Plc. confirming that it is in talks for a merger of its Indian unit with Aditya Birla Groups Idea Cellular Ltd.
				   
				The proposed merger will create the nations largest telecom firm with combined revenue of Rs78,000 crore and a 43% share of the market hitherto dominated by Bharti Airtel Ltd, which reported annual revenue of Rs50,008 crore from local telecom operations in the last financial year.Vodafone confirms that it is in discussion with the Aditya Birla Group about an all share merger of Vodafone India (excluding Vodafones 42% stake in Indus Towers) and Idea, British company Vodafone Group said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange on Monday.With Vodafone India Ltds tower unit out of the proposed merger, Vodafone Group and the Aditya Birla Group will be almost equal partners. The two would have equal rights in the new company, said Idea.ALSO READ | Vodafones idea for an escape route from its Indian tormentThe consolidation has been triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, in which parent Reliance Industries Ltd has invested a staggering $25 billion.Since the launch of its services in September, Jio has offered free voice and data and signed up more than 72 million users, forcing rivals, including Vodafone India and Idea, to slash tariffs in response.Vodafone Group had to write off 5 billion in its Indian business last year and defer a proposed share sale which will become irrelevant should the merger go through; Idea is already listed on the exchanges and the merged entity will automatically be listed.ALSO READ | Ideas shares surge on Vodafone merger talks, so do AirtelsWhen a rival with deep pockets enters the market with an investment as huge as Rs1.5 trillion, and starts offering free services, it is bound to put pressure on others, said Ajay Bodke, chief executive and chief portfolio manager at brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd. Consolidation makes sense in such times.The combined entity will exceed the maximum user base limit of 50% in as many as nine licence areas and revenue market share will surpass the 50% threshold in five circles, according to a telecom analyst who declined to be named.That, analysts say, is unlikely to pose a significant hurdle for the merger.The rapid expansion of Jios user base will prevent the merged entity from breaching the subscriber base limit, added the analyst cited above. The combination will also give the merged entity substantial spectrum musclenearly 28% of the spectrum in the key Delhi and Mumbai markets where Idea has a weak footprint.ALSO READ | Airtel may lose market leaders position, courtesy Vodafone-Idea merger, Jio entryThe telecom department rules restricting an entitys holding to no more than 50% of the spectrum in a given band and 25% of the spectrum assigned in a circle would mean that the merged entity would have to surrender spectrum in Kerala in the 900 megahertz (MHz) band and in Gujarat and Maharashtra in the 2,500MHz band. The merged entity could sell the additional spectrum in almost five circles to Airtel or Jio. We believe that a potential Idea/Vodafone merger could make strategic sense (move to No.1 market share, scale/synergy benefits, and complementary footprint with Vodafone strong in urban areas and Idea strong in rural areas), Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note on Monday. The brokerage suggested that the merged entity would realize an increased Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of 9-12% as a result of synergies in operating expenditure arising from the merger.Jios entry has also forced rivals to make huge investments, leading to mounting debts for all operators.With current level of wafer-thin margins, it is uneconomical to invest more in acquiring contiguous territories, spectrum or upgrade into 4G or LTE technology. Hence, consolidation is inevitable, said Singapore-based Sanjay Guglani, chief investment officer at Silverdale Funds.Ideas net debt is expected to cross Rs55,000 crore by the end of March 2017. Its second-quarter profit for financial year 2017 fell 88% to Rs91 crore from Rs762 crore in the year ago period. Analysts says that Ideas December quarter performance could be worse. The company was due to announce its third quarter results on 23 January but told stock exchanges it has postponed it without further notifying when the results would be published. For Vodafone, net debt was at Rs76,800 crore for the half year ended September 2016. That came down to Rs35,430 crore in November after an infusion of Rs47,700 crore from the parent.As far as debt in concerned, from a lenders perspective too, a merger would be encouraged.

You are in the process of raising a large distressed asset fund. Where does that stand now?Our total idea is to target and invest Rs12,000-14,000 crore in the stressed asset businesses. About Rs5,000 crore comes from CDPQ; Edelweiss itself has been investing up to Rs1,000-1,500 crore every year which over the next four years would be about Rs 4,000 -5,000 crore. Another Rs4,000 crore would come from other investors in the stressed asset fund. Based on where we are now, we think that we can put up to Rs3,000 crore to work every year, so over four years, that does not sound too bad. There is a lot of interest for our stressed asset fund, but we wanted to close the CDPQ deal first. It should take about three to six months for the stressed asset fund to close. How are you beefing up your turnaround operations?We have hired a team of consultants, who have already started working on four or five projects at hand. We are also creating a network of experts of retired PSU executives and bank executives, who know how to deal with the stressed assets. Hard to put a number, but we would have about 200 such experts on our team right now, from segments like steel, cement, automobiles, etc. We are also tying up with a few consulting firms like EY, who can provide support in monitoring cash flows in these stressed companies. Stressed assets is a broad term that can mean quite a few things. What are your focus areas in this?This is a very flexible space for us. So what you say stressed could be either where the balancesheet is stretched, or where the companys capital structure needs a rework or even where company needs extra capital. There are a lot of opportunities that we are seeing where the asset is not stressed yet but if something is not done soon, it can get stressed.ALSO READ | Edelweiss, CDPQ to invest $750 mn in stressed assetsA small amount of capital early on can mean a lot more than a large amount of capital when the firm has become stressed. This is why we have structured the capital in such a way that it is very flexible capital and is not limited to only one type of company. What is the overall vision for Edelweiss?The idea is to grow further. Historically if you see, we have grown organically very well, but as and when an opportunity comes along, we jump in.

0.64,"Singapore: The Indian start-up ecosystem is quite fragmented, and has a lot of players in the business-to-consumer space (B2C) space, but it requires a lot more focus on business-to-business (B2B), said Nipun Mehrotra, vice-president, growth initiatives, IBM India & south Asia. There have been some big exits in the consumer segment with the likes of Myntra, Jabong and Freecharge etc and with more and more international brands venturing in to the Indian market the consumer start-up industry will witness further churn and consolidation. We definitely see huge opportunity for B2B start-ups to grow and be a larger value addition to corporates, he said in an interview. 
				   
				Edited excerpts: This year is shaping up to be perhaps the roughest ever for Indias technology companies. How do you think Indian start-up ecosystem should prepare themselves going forward?The startp-up ecosystem in India is evolving and as per the latest report by Nasscom- ZINNOV, India will be home to 10,500 start-ups by 2020. However, there is still a long way to go for the start-ups. On one hand, the start-ups need to come up with very deeply differentiated business models which will add value to their customers, and at the same time make their processes efficient and frugal - for example, leverage existing API (application programming interface) s as much as possible to build products rather than developing products from scratch. They need to make their investments work twice as hard to build their business in 2017 and beyond. Another example of things that can help is to be very user focused when they build their business vs being product feature-focused. Alignment to the end user is critical at an early stage and start-ups must embed design thinking aspect as they build their product.When it comes to global ecosystems, London is the first thing on ones mind when you talk fintech. What do you think of the fintech opportunity in India?The fintech industry has gained momentum in India since the beginning of 2015. The industry witnessed the emergence of numerous fintech start-ups, incubators, and investments from public and private investors. The key enablers in the industry like government policies, regulatory framework coupled with various banks like ICICI and AXIS coming up with their accelerators to work along with entrepreneurs has helped to drive the momentum in India. The fintech start-ups are further leveraging various government initiatives like Jan Dhan Yojna, Aadhaar, and Digital India and we will see a lot of innovation happening in this space in the coming years. While there is a lot of growth opportunity for this sector, the companies also need to look at greater collaboration between various players and amalgamate learnings and entrepreneurial experiences for further growth of this sector. There should also be a cohesive fintech environment built for complete infrastructure penetration. We are witnessing some innovation in the P2P (peer-to-peer) lending, robo advisory, bank-in-a-box, security and biometrics areas which are treading fast towards mass market implementation, with technology like blockchain just marking its entry with a promising future for the fintech companies.What is your take on Indian governments approach to the start-up ecosystem in India?The government has launched many progressive programs to address the requirements of the start-up ecosystem in India. (With) Start Up India, along with programmes like Make in India, the government is giving a further boost to the start-up community. Government is also focusing on making start-ups leverage new age technologies and has set up National Initiative for Development and Harnessing Innovations (NIDHI), an umbrella programme which aims to nurture ideas and innovations in the start-up ecosystem. ...friendly policies like waiving income tax on their profit for the first three years, a simple exit policy, fast tracking of the patent applications, 80% exemption in patent fee, self-certification based compliance system etc are bold move to get more young minds in the start-up space. There can be more work done to support the growth of start-ups in India by driving structured collaboration between government and corporates. We believe that with emergence of new technologies like cognitive, cloud, IoT (Internet of Things), design thinking etc. and governments push for R&D (research and development) the startup ecosystem can transform the innovation culture and place India on a high growth trajectory.Exits are still an issue in India, when do you see them happening?We believe the Indian start-up ecosystem is quite fragmented and while we have a lot of B2C start-ups, we do require more focus on B2B and on start-ups that are differentiated by IP or deep tech. Start-ups also need to focus on building a scalable business, with an international outlook and catering to standards that make them attractive to large global tech companies or global clients. There is a need for uniqueness and use of deep technology to distinguish from B2C models. We believe for exits to ramp up, there needs to be a concerted approach by all players in the ecosystem and to possibly replicate the success that Israelas one examplehas seen. We do see the government being aligned towards helping start-ups not just grow but also help in their exit process. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Bill 2015, tabled in the Lok Sabha last December, has provisions for fast track and/or voluntary closure of businesses. With the shelf life of Internet-born companies among consumers being low for various reasons like competitive market, too many options, cashback and lucrative benefits, we think its about time that we will witness more exits happening soon. There have been some big exits in the consumer segment with the likes of Myntra, Jabong and Freecharge etc and with more and more international brands venturing into the Indian market the consumer start-up industry will witness further churn and consolidation. We definitely see a huge opportunity for B2B start-ups to grow and be a larger value addition to corporates.Globally, IBM has put capital into venture capital fundsyouve invested in over 50 fundsbut, weve not seen IBM do that in India and south-east Asia. Why is that so?Every start-up has two major requirementsresources and capital. There is no dearth of capital for the right idea and the right team, and there are many investors who are providing this. Where we can differentially add, tremendous value is from giving the much-needed strategic and technology mentorship which further helps the start-up to leverage their money in the right direction. IBM provides access to clients, access to deep technology engagement with our labs and access to mentoring and all of this without the startups giving up any equity for it.In India, you have partnered with Kalaari and Indian Angel Network to work with the start-upsbut this is for mentoring, training and educating and getting them to cloud and cognitive technologies at an early stage. How much leverage do VCs even have in influencing such decisions for their portfolio companies? We are partnering with a select few investors who are actively engaged in supporting and mentoring start-ups in incubating their ideas. At IBM, we believe that we can add value from our deep enterprise technology, our huge spend on research and probably the worlds best access to enterprise clients to help these start-ups and also VCs. We are looking beyond selling our products and solutions to becoming essential to the ecosystem through a whole range of collaborative activitiesincluding helping their portfolio companies get access to IBMs senior leadership team, by jointly working with clients, through activities like design thinking etc with Kalaari and Indian Angel Network.In areas like cloud, start-ups have several competitive optionswhat makes IBM different?IBM has been committed to the overall development of the start-up community and provides startups with free cloud credits on IBM Cloud Solutions worth $24,000 for one year helping emerging companies. We further help them to harness the power of IBM cloud, as well as connect them to IBMs vast global network of clients, consultants, innovation centers, and developers. Several start-ups across India are tapping into IBM cloud to run critical applications and grow their businesses. Both IBM Bluemix, a hybrid cloud development platform and Softlayer, a cloud infrastructure platform, have received a good response in terms of adoption from Indian startups.For start-ups, IBM does not enjoy the mind recall when it comes to looking for potential partners/ How are you working to change that, and given the pace at which IBM operates, can you ever adapt to the requirements, demands, flexibilities that the start-ups require?Indian start-ups have the quality and value to help IBM itself remain agile...so part of this focus is also to help IBMs employeestechnical, sales, business and even functional staff like HR and financelearn and remain abreast with trends. We believe our employees need to stay close to the market and where it is headed and helping in their personal and official capacity to mentor start-ups and help them to innovate. We believe in co-creating and co-innovating with the start-ups and we have an IBM Garage in Bangalore wherein we will have workshops and get start-up get access to a lot of our enterprise customers to build products together.",2016-11-11,SL6pCMJg6ebL1rewMDvayL,"There is a huge opportunity for B2B start-ups to grow, says Nipun Mehrotra, vice-president, growth initiatives, IBM India & south Asia",11:03,Indian start-ups need to focus more on B2B space: Nipun Mehrotra
0.49,"It is the Monday after Christmas, and I am meeting Ashish Bhasin, chairman and chief executive officer, Dentsu Aegis Network (DAN), South Asia, for lunch at San-Qi at Mumbais Four Seasons hotel. Arriving a few minutes early, I am reminded of the long boozy lunches the admen were always having in that epochal TV series Mad Men. When Bhasin walks in, a few moments later, it is with the air of easy familiarity. Bhasin has the build of a prosperous Punjabi man and the sartorial style of an adman, in his beige suit and maroon tie.
				   
				The 52-year-old says he is brash; he exults in it. I have announced that the Dentsu Aegis Network wants to be the No.2 player in the country by 2017, says Bhasin, who believes in putting pressure on himself to perform by going public with his objectives. So far, the strategy seems to have worked. In 2008, Bhasin left Lintas to join a bare-bones operation at Aegis India. Eight years later, he presides over DAN with 2,800 employees and revenue of Rs3,500 crore in the year ended December 2016.The last few years have seen Dentsu Aegis on an acquisition spree, buying companies as if they were candy. From digital marketing companies like Webchutney, Communicate 2 and Happy Creative, to public relations firm Perfect Relations and, most lately, user interface and user experience design company Fractal Ink Design Studio, Dentsu Aegis has been on a roll when it comes to the business of buying.If you are not growing, you are dying. Acquisition is something where when you talk to 20 people, four-five may come into the final consideration set. So at any point of time we are talking to four-five people. Its like a courtship, says Bhasin. He says it takes him about a year to complete an acquisition. More than the money, its the chemistry with the management team that matters. I spend a lot of time interacting with the people, across several locations. If they are too full of themselves, you know early on that this guy is never going to be a team player, says Bhasin. He says he has let good businesses go because he felt the promoters were talented but cavalier, like cowboys. Many of Bhasins learnings came from his 20 years in Lintas. When I joined Lintas (in 1988) as a management trainee, I used to be the envy of my peers. I was working on the Liril soap account, and one of our key tasks was to find the new Liril girl. We had to hang around in colleges and had to attend the auditions of bikini-clad models in a bathroom with a shower, he reminiscences.The Lintas days, where Bhasin shot commercials in curfew-struck Burma (now Myanmar), and managed everything from the health of bathrooms to the health of the balance sheet at its Chennai office, make for a fascinating backstory. But a waiter is hovering discreetly in the background. So we break to order lunch. Bhasin is a regular at San-Qi,  and recommends green Thai chicken curry and sautéed prawns, with a side serving of rice. We place the order and move on to trends in media.The whole industry is focusing on ad shots and angles. That is all very important, but guys, the cheese is moving. I dont know why people in advertising are blind, he says. Media is no longer the print and broadcast medium it used to be. The power has shifted to digital. Today people are still spending Rs3 crore to make an ad. But there are digital agencies that make very good ads for Rs30,000 and (they are) getting more views than you are getting on your Rs3 crore ad, says BhasinOur food arrives. The Thai curry is bland in a pleasing way, and the prawns are bathed in a delicate tomato gravy. No onions, Bhasin comments, as the waiter spoons out our individual helpings. That done, we return to the business of media, and to the nuts and bolts of managing a growing organization.Adding employees and acquisitions to DAN has meant that Bhasin has also had to buy or rent real estate. The Bengaluru office recently inaugurated a brand new DAN House building in Koramangala. I am a big believer in co-location; I like to have all my people together, he says, adding that he puts great store by interactions with his employees. There are no walls in my office, there is a glass partition for sound, but everybody can see everything. My email ID is known to everybody and I encourage them to write to me. Some of the best ideas come from the youngest employees, who pick up competitive information as well as knowledge of new trends. The other knowledge source of new trends has always been travel. Ï went to MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology); I went to Tokyo to see the latest advances in AI (artificial intelligence) and robotics. I am constantly keeping myself updated and shaking up my guys. Wake up, this is reality!The constant travel can be trying for his family. Yet Bhasins son Abhinay, 24, likes advertising and would like to make a career in it. His 16-year-old daughter Abhilasha plays squash for India. Wife Mayuri, a classmate from St Xaviers College in Mumbai, worked as a lecturer and then with American Express in Mumbai. Bhasin himself did his bachelors in science (zoology and biochemistry) and then a masters in business administration from Mumbais Sydenham Institute of Management Studies, Research and Entrepreneurship Education.The family likes to travel together, going on cruises, wildlife safaris, or just to their holiday home in Lonavla. There hasnt been a lot of that in the last few years though, for Bhasin hasnt managed to take time off. Its almost 3. Bhasin orders a kulfi and I take a cappuccino. And we continue our conversation.Bhasin is clearly a man on a mission. It burns me when I see any part of a clients business going out, either because they are sharing it with other agencies or because I dont have a service to offer, he says. He is determined to make DAN No.2 in the business, ahead of Interpublic Group and second only to WPP.

				The launch of high-speed telecom services by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in September prompted Swedish telecom equipment and network services provider Ericsson AB to fast-track the roll-out of its 4G network.Jios launch definitely accelerated the development of high bit-rate mobile broadband. Without Jio, we wouldnt have seen such a quick roll-out of 4G. It would have happened a little bit more slowly, said Paolo Colella, head for the India region at Ericsson.We have already seen the 4G wave happening in many of the Western countries. In the Far East, China, Korea (and) Japan have already invested heavily in building up infrastructure. Jio has contributed to the acceleration and aligning of India to the rest of the big economies, Colella added.The limited spread of wireline fixed infrastructure in India has led to limited usage of broadband. As the country moves to 4G, there is expected to be massive demand for smartphones.We are anticipating by 2020 we will have at least 800 million smartphones in the market, so the Internet, for Indian people, is mobile. That is a major difference, Colella said.(The other difference is) the industry was not predicting to have Android phones at $40 per unit at the end of 2016, probably expecting it to happen in at least 12 months, if not 18 months further, he added.True Software Scandinavia AB, which makes the Truecaller mobile app to identify incoming calls through a crowd-sourced database, is another Swedish company that has gained from the Jio launch.The number of Truecaller users on the Jio network is already three times that of any other carrier, its co-founder Alan Mamedi said.We see that Reliance Jio right now is three times bigger than other carriers for us, as new users are joining every day. It is not that users from other carriers are droppingthey actually continue to grow. So, the trend we are seeing is that more people get connected for the first time because it is affordable, which is very interesting, Mamedi said.Mamedi added that Reliance Jio will remain a game-changer even after the expiry of free services offer since the tariffs are 10 times cheaper than the competitor.Truecaller, which entered India in 2009, struggled in the initial years as the data market had not developed, and found its feet only after the widespread adoption of 3G and 4G services.Mamedi said as more people use 4G services, it will give tools to smart people to create something magical, driving more start-ups.Home-grown mobile handset manufacturer Lava Mobiles is another company that has gained from the Jio launch. The company hopes widespread 4G adoption will help double its market share to 20% by 2020.In the operator sector, they are doing disruption, but this disruption will increase the operator business also, pushing it to double. Each company is going to gain, Lava Mobiles chairman and managing director Hari Om Rai said.Lava Mobiles is currently investing at least Rs2,600 crore for capacity expansion to produce 18 million devices every month by 2021.4G phones have witnessed a very a high demand in last six weeks. For our industry, it is very valuable. There will be disruption and explosion in the industry.

-0.72,"San Francisco: Facebook is updating its trending feature that highlights hot topics on its social networking site, part of its effort to root out the kind of fake news stories that critics contend helped Donald Trump become president.
				   
				With the changes announced Wednesday, Facebooks trending list will consist of topics being covered by several publishers. Before, it focused on subjects drawing the biggest crowds of people sharing or commenting on posts.The switch is intended to make Facebook a more credible source of information by steering hordes of its 1.8 billion users toward topics that reflect real world events being covered by multiple outlets, Will Cathcart, the companys vice president of product management, said in a blog post.Facebook also will stop customizing trending lists to cater to each users personal interests. Instead, everyone located in the same region will see the same trending lists, which currently appear in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and India.That change could widen the scope of information Facebooks users see, instead of just topics that reinforce what they may have already heard or read elsewhere. The broader perspective might reduce the chances of Facebooks users living in a filter bubble  only engaging with people and ideas with which they agree.Facebook introduced its trending list in 2014 in response to the popularity of a similar feature on Twitter, the short-messaging service that competes for peoples attention and advertising revenue.Questions about Facebooks influence on what people are reading intensified last summer after a technology blog relying on an anonymous source reported that human editors routinely suppressed conservative viewpoints on the site.Facebook fired the small group of journalists overseeing its trending items and replaced them with an algorithm that was supposed to be a more neutral judge about what to put on the list.But the automated approach began to pick out posts that were getting the most attention, even if the information in them was bogus. Some of the fake news stories targeted Democratic presidential nominee Hilary Clinton, prompting critics to believe the falsehoods help Donald Trump overcome a large deficit in public opinion polls.Facebook chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg initially brushed off that notion as crazy , but in December the company announced a slew of new measures to curb the spread of fake news.To discourage the creation of fake news in the first place, Facebook also is banishing perpetual publishers of false information from its lucrative ad network.Google, which operates an even larger digital ad network, has taken a similar stand against publishers of fake news. In a report released Wednesday, Google said it had exiled about 200 publishers from its AdSense network for various misrepresentations as part of a review conducted during the six weeks of last year.",2017-01-26,TAvH7KeDedmQvk8PKHYxHI,Facebooks trending list will now consist of topics being covered by several publishers,10:42,Facebook takes aim at fake news with new trending formula
0.25,"New Delhi: Director general of hydrocarbons Atanu Chakraborty is presiding over the transition to a new regulatory regime for Indias hydrocarbon pursuits aimed at wooing investors with liberal terms when the global oil and gas industry is sailing through a painful phase of low prices. 
				   
				In an interview, Chakraborty said steps will be taken to reduce disputes in the sector and to make the terms for producing unconventional and difficult to extract fuels as investor-friendly as possible. Edited excerpts:Will India be able to cut import dependence on oil and gas by 10% as planned, considering cooking gas consumption and its import is rising?The Ujjwala programme (of distributing LPG without upfront payment to the poor) is part of a shift towards using cleaner fuel and improvement in the quality of life, which is bound to happen. The demand for fuel on account of this has been captured in the consumption growth of fossil fuels. We have to produce that much extra over and above what can be produced on a business as usual scenario. We are looking at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 5.6%. Year on year growth has been almost 11% in 2014-15. The planned 10% reduction in import dependence by 2022 is called for to make us reasonably strategically secure. To achieve that, we need to increase acreage (under exploration and production). We have launched the auction of the discovered small fields this year, after a gap of about six years. In the last two years, fuel price volatility was a reason not to go ahead with the offer of blocks. The blocks currently on offer are relatively small and have many hydrocarbon discoveries so that investors do not have to spend a lot on exploration. There are other incentives too (such as pricing and marketing freedom and duty free import of equipment). The idea is to incentivize investments and to add to overall production. Having more players in the market will increase competition and efficiency in the industry.With global energy firms now cutting back on their investments, the auction of small discovered fields is going to be a test of their appetite for further investments, isnt it?Under the new hydrocarbon exploration licensing policy (HELP), pricing and marketing freedom is given to gas produced from deep-water, high pressure and high temperature areas. Also, the new royalty structure favours investors. Under the revenue share regime, which replaces profit sharing prescribed in the earlier licensing policy, governments share remains the same (as a percentage of revenue), which gives investors the comfort and incentive to produce more and benefit more in absolute terms. With stable policies, robust economic growth and improvement of our ranking in ease of doing business, the country risk for energy firms is very low. We have to leverage it to get investments and then hold their hands to ensure that they get access to market quickly. We have also ensured that they get the processing facilities of ONGC and Oil India Ltd on a commercial basis. There is no gas utilization policy, the entire market for gas is open to producers. People do talk about other incentives in the case of shale gas. Perhaps we will again revisit the regime to see what more can be offered for production of tight oil and shale gas. We need to tap all these resources simultaneously. Increasing productivity and acreage under exploration and getting to difficult reservoirs is broadly the contours of the strategy. Auction of the small discovered field is the first step. The response to the roadshows has been tremendous. As we learn from the process, if we need to tweak our offering, we certainly will do it in a transparent way. Nothing is cast in stone.What is the strategy on unconventional fuels like gas hydrates and shale gas?In the east coast, we are working together with Japan and the US Geological Survey to extract gas from gas hydrates. It is still at a research stage and we have to reach a stage where the molecules are stable. While tight oil and shale gas are within the realm of possibility, gas hydrate has to reach a stage when we can think of commercial production. Considering our reliance on import, we need to be there on all these emerging areas from day one so that we can monetize any upside at the earliest. The gas market in India is rapidly developing with new transmission lines coming up, including for city gas distribution and for fertilizer plants. The share of gas in the national hydrocarbon basket is expected to go up from about 7% now to 25% in some years. In the case of Gujarat, it is already 25%.What are the tax breaks available for gas producers?Income-tax exemption no longer exists for gas, but import of equipment enjoys customs duty exemption.Price volatility in a highly capital intensive and risky sector such as energy, could in no time bankrupt a successful company. Disputes in such a scenario is normal as we have seen in the past. How do you plan to address this?There would be differences in perception, and hence disputes, in big contracts such as those for natural resources. We have to continuously fine tune the resolution mechanisms. We have made many corrections in the production sharing regime and we keep improving the existing system. If the contractor wants to produce hydrocarbons, the government will always help them. Those who are well intentioned, will always do well. We have a large number of fields which have in the last 20 years added to our energy basket. As a regulator, we want every energy company to bring investments and produce more. We will be taking many steps to further improve regulations.What are the specific areas you would be working on to reduce disputes?Communicating right at the time of auctioning the fields, the different aspects of executing the contract and the issues where perceptions could differ between parties, can eliminate avoidable disputes. We keep examining the models elsewhere that could help in reducing the time required for dispute resolution. For example, invoking force majeure provisions in a contract is one area around which many disputes take place. Creating awareness about this among investors is important. A lot of education is required on contract management by the parties. In the road shows for the discovered small fields, we tried to educate businesses about these aspects. We are also thinking of having a portal to facilitate communication among stakeholders that will help in reducing disputes.",2016-10-13,TbkBDUN0P9dE8WGxSKoC0N,"Steps will be taken to reduce disputes in the energy sector, says director general of hydrocarbons Atanu Chakraborty ",01:41,The entire gas market is open to producers: Atanu Chakraborty
0.34,"Mukesh Ambani-promoted Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJio) has changed the metrics of the telecom business in India to such an extent that market leader Bharti Airtel Ltd has taken note. 
				   
				After a series of allegations over issues related to points of interconnection, predatory pricing and Internet usage charge, there seems to be a truce between Airtel and Jio.ALSO READ | Reliance Jio is here to stay: Airtel CEOIn an interview, Airtel chief executive Gopal Vittal said Jios entry strategy is good and bold and that the firm is here to stay. Vittal, however, said Airtel will continue to bank upon its spectrum assets, brand, network expansion and capital expenditure. Edited excerpts:How do you look at your operations in the wake of Jios entry?We still feel there is an opportunity in the rural areas and we are going deeper there to drive penetration. We believe managing price volume trade-off to maximize Arpu (average revenue per user) is very important. Driving penetration of data is a very important piece; we have seen a slowdown in last six months. We have put in a bunch of initiatives in the last three months and we see some early signs of success.ALSO READ | Airtel to combat Reliance Jio on price, bundling and cost front: CEO Gopal VittalThe metric we chase is our revenue market share (RMS) because we believe that RMS is the only metric that determines if customers are giving you a higher share of their wallets. And in the last one year, the highest increase we have seen is an almost 1.5% growth in market share and the incremental revenue that is generated in a year, we got about 50% of that last year.The long answer to your short question is, its not about the next three or six months, it is really about continuing to drive this passionately because we have seen competitors come and go. I mean in the last 10 years, its been a brutally competitive industry. There used to be 13 players and many players were operating at half the pricing of what we are operating at. We have had bumps, ups and downs on the road, it is not that every year has been great. We have had years where we have actually lost market share and then we had to come back. And consequence of losing market share is that you lose everything, revenue and margin, you lose it all. So this is a metric which is very important to us to make sure we are competitive.Why is the slowdown in data happening?I think the barriers to it are many, one is the price of the devicethe difference between a Rs3,000-3,500 phone which is the cheapest device for data and lets say a Rs1,000 device which is a feature phone is still a big deal for many customers. Second is that a lot of customers dont know what to do with the Internet; even if they need it, they dont know how to use it. The other part is that they have a perception that its expensive and there is a perception of value that you need to create. So, its a combination of all of these things. Amongst women, its much lower than men, penetration rate is substantially low even in urban areas, let alone in rural.So, contrary to the perception that Jios entry will boost data consumption, it hasnt really?I think there is a difference between penetration and consumption. Consumption will continue to grow. As pricing comes down, people use a lot. I think in the long term, penetration will grow, there is no question about it. I am just saying that this is an important piece that we should acknowledge, do a bunch of things to actually shape it.  Do you think what Jio is doing is sustainable?I think it is sustainable. Ultimately, its got linked to revenue. To that extent, they have chosen to play in a certain way, which is good and bold. Hopefully, it works for them.But the strategy that they have come out with, has the industry seen similar strategies before?Firstly, you have not seen that. You have seen one of the players who operates in six circles, who operates in voice pricing, which is 50-60% lower, which is Telenor. There again, they have bundles. At certain price points (for voice), speak as much as you want. That we have seen. They also have very simple tariff plans, which has worked for them, but they have come under some pressure in terms of whats happening in the context of the industry. How will you assess the impact of Jio? I would say they are certainly going to stay. You would see consolidation in the market. Even today, you have eight players; and in the next three years, you may see four players. Thats a good thing.From our position, it would come back to whether we have spectrum assets, capex and financial wherewithal to invest in the network and the answer to that is, yes.How do you see the data and voice play turning out in the coming quarters? We have seen erosion in both voice as well as data. Data has been more secular. It has been growing year on year. I think the data tariff erosion is okay as long as we get data-driven revenue growth. What we have seen most recently is revenue growth softening. Part of that is on account of free services because there are people who want to try it for free.On voice, we have seen elasticity. We have seen strong growth on volumes and erosion on tariff for us. Voice revenue growth has been pretty good. Last quarter we had 9-10% growth, which is reasonably good. We will see some softening of this growth because of free services being offered and some point when they get priced in, we will come back and look at how do we respond to that.Which of the twodata or voicewill have more growth?In India, the average use of minutes is 415 or 420. It is among the highest in the world. The only market which is higher is the US because you have voice free in all their plans. But the pricing starts $40-$50. So, there it is 50% higher. There is a finite limit to how much I want to speak to the other person. That will see more secular growth. On data, sky is the limit because you can do everything through the Internet. Do you see a point where voice can be made completely free like you said about the US?I think there will be a duality to the market. Voice will be free when someone is paying for the data. If everything is free, then we are not having this conversation. But if you are making something free, then you have to charge something else. So, the key question that comes out is, how much Arpu do you get? I think there will be a set of customers who will demand that through bundles. So, that will happen. Will that happen all across the market? I dont think so. I think there will still be some amount of duality in the market.So, you do not see a tipping point for making voice free?Even today, we are doing it. The 1599 price has come down to 999. At 999, voice is free with a bundle of data. But, people are paying for the package. Whether I am paying for voice or data, it does not really matter. I am paying for the aggregate. If that numbers comes down then the question is for competing whats the price you want to compete at? Thats a stroke of the pen decision. This market is complex and nuanced enough that you cant do a call and odd approach. It is not this or that. You have to play together because the scale that we have, the number of customers we serve, we will have to play them together. This is true for the industry: 20% of customers give you 50-60% of your revenue. This is true for all categories. Does that mean that 40-50% of the revenue is not important? No. It is absolutely important but we will have to find the right cost to serve them. So, thats where the and comes in. You have to do both. For a new entrant, it is easier because you will say I will only operate like this. In the context of planned investments by Jio and Vodafone, how do you look to fund your expansion? We generate close to Rs. 15,000-16,000  crore of cash on an annual basis. Our net debt to EBITDA is 2.2, which is very comfortable and very competitive with the best run telcos around the world. So whether you look at it from the spectrum perspective, or rolling out capex a year and half in advance, or brand in terms of who owns 4G today, or best broadband experience or whether its our customer base of 260 million, in all respects we are in a solid position. But from a financial position, the fact is that this industry is in deep debt and the return on capital of the entire industry is less than 1%, which is really low. Even for us as a leading player, we earn just 8% which is no different than a fixed deposit. So that is the function of the humongous cost of spectrum that we have purchased and some of that was a function of what happened in 2014, where we did the renewals. Where we were actually forced to buy, there was not enough spectrum and so if we didnt buy we would be forced out of business and we may have overpaid because of the design of that auction. What is your road map on cutting down the debt? We have just announced a process with a proposed significant stake sale of Infratel. A committee of directors has been appointed, they will look into it, study it and look at all the options on the table for the board. Beyond that I cannot comment right now.",2016-11-02,UBHj5LZi5HeOpQepV8xx4I,"Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal in an interview says the telecom firm will continue to bank upon its spectrum assets, brand, network expansion, capex",01:31,"Airtel planning rural expansion, in wake of Jio entry: CEO Gopal Vittal"
0.43,"Bengaluru: The squabble between rival factions owing allegiance to Cyrus Mistry and Ratan Tata at the Tata group could mask the potentially poor performance of individual companies. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) could be one beneficiary.
				   
				According to BNP Paribas, TCS will report a 6% increase in dollar revenue in the current financial year, down from last years 7%. Even this projection looks a tad generous, and, according to Mint calculations, TCS runs the risk of less than 5.6% growth.Put simply, TCS, for the first time since it clocked 5.4% growth in 2009-10, could add less than $1 billion in incremental revenue this year. And that could ring alarm bells at TCS, which ended with $16.5 billion in revenue in the financial year to March last year.TCS will report its fiscal third quarter earnings on Thursday.Accenture Plc., a firm about twice as large as TCS, recorded 6% growth in the year ended August (Accenture follows a September-August financial year). Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solution Corp., which was about half of TCSs size of $6 billion in 2009when Natarajan Chandrasekaran became the CEO of TCSwill still manage 9% growth to end the year with at least $13.5 billion in revenue (Cognizant follows the calendar year as financial year).At the heart of TCSs underperformance, which started manifesting in July 2014, is its inability to build a stronger consulting practice and the managements reluctance to buy small firms for technologies like design consulting and data analytics and automation platform providers. TCS also faces some client-specific challenges, all of which have led to low growth. Still, over the last two years, this has not stopped TCS management from claiming the company is making itself future-ready. The biggest concern for stakeholders is if TCS will continue to chug along in 2017-18 and disappoint with depressing growth numbers. For now, the signals are not bright. With this as the backdrop, Mint puts the spotlight on five things to watch in TCSs third quarter earnings on 12 January:1. Revenue growth and management commentary on the demand outlookBNP Paribas expects TCSs dollar revenue to inch up 0.3% to $4.39 billion in the October-December period on a sequential basis. Most brokerages do not expect any significant uptick in growth in the current quarter, either. Nonetheless, management commentary on demand for companys services from clients, especially in Europe and US, will be crucial.2. Pressure on profitability Since January last year, TCSs operating margins have been under pressure. Its 26.1% Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin at the end of March quarter was 54 basis points less than margins at the end of October-December period of 2014. The companys margins further contracted to 25.1% at the end of June quarter, and improved to 26% at the end of July-September period. Now, as commoditized deals come under further pricing pressure, traditional levers like going slow on hiring will not be enough to offset the gradual decline in profitability. For this reason, most analysts are doubtful if TCS will be able to operate in the managements stated guidance of 26-28%.3. Performance in the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) and retail sectorsAccentures performance in the September-November period and management commentary suggests some weakness in business from clients in the BFSI sector. This spells trouble for a company like TCS, which generates more than 40% of its business from BFSI. Retail segment too has seen a decline, and for this reason, management commentary on BFSI and retail, which together bring about 54% of its total revenue, will be eyed.4. Impact of US bill seeking to increase pay to employees with H1B visasEarlier this month, a legislation demanding that outsourcing firms pay at least $100,000 a year to employees who work in the US was introduced in the Congress. Analysts and industry executive believe it could take up to a year before the US makes this a law. Washingtons demand that companies like TCS pay a minimum wage of $100,000 to employees with H1B visas could hurt profitability by 300-500 basis points, according to a 9 January note by JPMorgan Chase and Co. analyst Viju George. Management commentary on this will be watched.5. Weak sectors and geographiesTCS does not expect growth to rebound in Japan. The company claims to have arrested any loss of business from its UK-based insurance platform Diligenta. Growth from telecoms segment continue to be wobbly. Together, underperformance by the three units eroded about 2% growth from the companys 11.9% growth on constant currency basis in 2015-16.

0.98,"One of the authors of this article built a speech recognition engine in the early 1990s. It was built on a special purpose digital signal processor, in a lab that was especially dedicated to this project. The engine required two days of training, could recognize a single voice and had a vocabulary of close to 50 words. It was close to state-of-the-art at that time. 
Cut to the present. All smartphones today have the ability to recognize speech. No special hardware is needed. Training needs are minimalthe technology works straight out of the box and can be trained to recognize anybodys voice. And the vocabulary is infinite. The phenomenon that enabled this rapid change is the advancement in processing power, storage and communication. Computing speed is doubling every year, as per Moores law, which predicted an exponential growth in the number of transistors in integrated circuits within processors. Similar stories of transformation can be told about storage and communication. Todays technology road maps have gone beyond the classical Moores law with the advent of distributed computing, rapid development of smart devices packed with sensors and the Internet of things.While we have seen a lot of technology transformations over the last 20 years, what is even more fascinating is the expectation that the next two decades will see technology innovations being rolled out at a faster pace than ever before. Technological change will continue to be exponential. Noted inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil argues that there is even an exponential growth in the rate of exponential growth! What this means is that in the 21st century, we wont see a 100 years of technological progress. We will see 20,000 years of progress at todays rate.FIVE BIG TECHNOLOGY THEMES FOR THE FUTUREWhile there are many technological advancements taking place all around us, we think five big themes will play a very important role in defining the next 20 years.Gene is the new Byte: In the grand scheme of things, we are all very similar. In fact, 99.9% of our genes are identical. Its the last 0.1% that makes all the difference! In April 2003, the human genome was completely mapped for the first time. The rate of reduction in the cost to sequence a persons genome has outpaced even Moores law, from $10 million in 2008 to just $1,000 today. Going forward, this cost is likely to continue dropping and in the near future, we would be able get our complete genome mapped and stored in USB drives or on the cloud for a mere $100. This will open the doors to fantastic possibilities for preventive healthcare and personalized medical treatment. Genome mapping has large implications for agriculture as well, with possibilities like the development of more productive and disease resistant crops, or the creation of diet plans tailored to suit our respective heredities!Disruptions in energy: The end of energy as we know is near. Advancements in technology have reduced the cost of solar energy to 45 cents a watt from $100 a watt in 1970. Interestingly, during this period, other forms of energy have seen a 16-fold increase in price. The average cost of solar panels fell by 75% between 2009 and 2014, and is expected to decline by another 25% by 2018. Solar power tariffs are expected to reach grid parity in India in 2018, and then go below that level. Battery technology is advancing rapidly to help store this energy. Polymer and hybrid-flow battery technology being developed currently will increase energy density, increasing the storage capacity of a given physical space. It is likely that in the near future, many of us will be able to generate, store and use clean solar energy right off our rooftops, at a cost cheaper than buying electricity from the grid. With smart micro-grids, one will even be able to sell excess energy back, creating a truly distributed energy network.Advancements in material science: In Star Trek, the science fiction television show, the crew on-board starships used food replicators to synthesize any meal they wanted while travelling through space. This surreal concept is now inching towards reality. 3D printers have come a long way since the 1980s, and are soon going to be affordable enough for educational and residential usage. Nanomaterials with unique optical, electronic and mechanical properties are driving the next generation of consumer electronics, filtration systems and biomedical treatment. Similarly, advances in biodegradable plastics augur well for environmentally friendly packaging in the future. Ubiquitous digital connectivity: Ubiquitous digital connectivity has been elusive so far although it has been widely talked about by policymakers and technologists. But it is inevitable. Digital access will become more and more affordable as prices reduce. Consumers will increasingly bracket digital connectivity among needs as basic as roti, kapda and makaan (bread, clothes and home), and will allocate a larger share of wallet for it. Digital governance platforms will help governments significantly improve the distribution of subsidy programmes targeted at people with limited means and lastly, corporates that stand to benefit heavily from a burgeoning consumer class may make the economic trade-offs differently. AI and robotics revolution: Artificial intelligence (AI) is already a reality today with Google Search, Siri and IBM Watson being some examples. Todays AI tools excel at complex analytics. In 2016, AI mastered Go, widely considered the most difficult strategy game. However, it struggles with cognitive tasks that a two-year-old can dofor example, knowing the difference between the pictures of a cat and a dog. Genetic algorithms being developed today will strengthen AIs cognitive reasoning capabilities. Limitations on raw computational power will soon be overcome, powering AI tools to do what human brains can. Meanwhile, rapid advances in robotics, such as the development of bio-hybrid robots built using living tissue, are starting to take shape. We are on the cusp of an explosion in AI and robotics, which could make androids a reality in the near future.The interplay between these technology megatrends has the potential to significantly change the world as we know it today. Imagine solar energy-powered 3D printers being airlifted to disaster zones to provide food to people trapped there. Or, a mother in Salem, Tamil Nadu, getting her sons genome mapped, and later getting on a video conference with a New York-based doctor to seek allergy treatment options.Fundamental paradigm shifts driven by accelerating technologyChange in technology fundamentally shifts the production possibility frontier. Every time we hit the law of diminishing returns, newer technology provides a breakthrough. In addition to fundamental shifts in the cost curvewhich are a giventechnology expands the gamut of the possible by significantly altering core trade-offs. Let us look at three conventional business and economic trade-offs, which are getting busted:Two-way real-time interactions versus one-way outreach: In the past, businesses could either focus on rich information tailored to a niche market or reach out to a larger market that sacrificed richness for the additional reach. However, today, two-way, real-time communication with rich and relevant content has become a reality. Digital technology enables access to global platforms for buying and selling, marketing and financing from anywhere. Advanced analytics, combined with mobile technology, is allowing companies to target each consumer individually, across their entire client base. For example, if it is raining, your regular coffee shop can tempt you to brave the weather and visit it by offering you a promotional scheme on your favourite drink, through an app on your smartphone.Supply and demand mismatch: With the shift towards elimination of bespoke hardware, and value migrating to software, it is possible today to match supply with demand almost perfectly. Increased access and connectivity via technology is driving a revolution in the sharing economy as well. Sharing is not new to us. The barter system has been in place for centuries, long before money was invented. Today, we are not only sharing digital information, we are also sharing physical things like homes and vehicles with each other, using digital market places.Scale versus cost: Technology is not only rapidly reducing servicing costs, it is also increasingly enabling businesses to move to an opex spend model, from the erstwhile capex heavy approach. This is helping expand firms reach to new consumers at a faster rate than ever before. For example, consumers with very low deposits can be served economically in an opex spend model, telecom base stations no longer need minimum efficient scale, retail distribution can be customized economically at a micro-market level, and 3D printing can significantly change manufacturing scale. SPECIFIC IMPLICATIONS OF ACCELERATING TECHNOLOGY FOR INDIARadical innovation with next-generation technology architecture:The Internet has served as the main platform for disruption across industries. Its architecture is decentralized, modular and stacked. Lower down the stack, the focus is on scale and efficient utilization, for example, server capacity. Higher up the stack, however, the focus is on content related to user needs and innovation. This stack-based architecture eliminates the trade-off between efficiency and innovation, as higher-layer innovators can rent scale from lower-level platform providers to conduct experiments at lower costs. This is already a reality in our lives. Case in point, Uber, which uses a stacked architecture comprising GPS, Google Maps, electronic payments and connected smartphonesnone of which it ownsto offer a disruptive and consumer-friendly transportation solution.In India, we are witnessing the rising usage of a similar stacked architecture, called the India Stack, in the financial services sector. Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar and mobile phones have created a fundamental layer of customer identification and access, on which multiple digital transactions can be built. This has the potential to solve our financial inclusion problem by eliminating the classical roadblocks of paper-based identity proofs, interaction with a physical bank and the availability of hard cash. The entire stack is an open resource, which means anyone can access and leverage it. A similar open stack architecture is being used by the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) to provide a platform for tax data management and reporting. The platform will provide the plumbing to bring together all GSTN stakeholders including taxpayers, banks, and central and state governments to completely transform Indias tax landscape.This is paradigm shift in technology architecture where innovation happens at the bottom of the stack and is available as a public good at a very low cost to everybody. The implications of this shift are quite profound and if deployed well can be used to address some of our very core socio-economic challenges.Ability to address Indias chronic challenges: Healthcare is one of the most complex challenges of our time, with the infrastructure and capital required to fix the problems and reduce the inequity in healthcare access being insufficient so far. Despite making progress over the last decade, India accounts for a disproportionate percentage of global incidences of disease. We have seven doctors for every 10,000 people, which is only half the average global doctor-patient ratio. Large-scale change is never easy, but technology holds extraordinary promise in helping address our healthcare challenges.By leveraging the technology stack already in placewide connectivity through mobile phones and high-speed data networks, Aadhaar, digitization of health recordswe can significantly improve every element of our health system, from education for prevention, to treatment and management. Big Data and analytics can fundamentally alter healthcare delivery and transform our public health and medical research initiatives through the establishment of national registries. India can become data-rich very rapidly. And a nationwide, connected, many-to-many health information highway with common data standards and interoperability features can just be what the doctor ordered! A similar approach can also be deployed in critical areas such as education and skilling, and it can fundamentally transform how India teaches and learns.Enabling organizations to be trailblazers: Historically, Indian firms have found it hard to address the challenges of low average purchasing power, lack of minimum efficient scale and widespread socio-economic inequity. With the acceleration of technology, these challenges get decimated. Acceleration in technology, coupled with relatively lower legacy investments, gives Indian firms the opportunity to leapfrog their peers to become global trailblazers. Technology makes investments modular, reducing capital outlays and experimentation costs, while increasing speed and agility, which are critical advantages in todays dynamic macroeconomic environment. There is every reason to believe that the next Alibaba, Amazon, Google, Tesla or Uber can emerge out of India.GOING FORWARD, WE NEED TO ADDRESS THREE KEY AREAS TO UNLOCK THIS TECHNOLOGY REVOLUTION1. How do we ensure sufficient investment in infrastructure at the lower level of the stack?Private returns on infrastructure investments are often substantially lower than the underlying social benefits generated. While benefits accrue to the economy at large through positive externalities, this does not assure returns for the infrastructure investor. Also, when infrastructure investment requires an entirely new generation of expensive technology, such as fibre, 4G or 5G, it can compound market failure. The government, through policy formulation, has a key role to play in encouraging sufficient investment in infrastructure.2. What changes should be make in our education system to equip our youth for the technology revolution?There is a need to rethink technology and vocational skills being imparted at higher education institutions. Future jobs will be very different from those in the market today. In addition to solving the existing challenges our education system faces, we need to ensure that it equips our youth with the necessary multidisciplinary skills to meet the needs of tomorrow. 3. How do we drive collaboration across stakeholders to unlock the full potential of technology-enabled transformation?The government, large corporates, start-ups and NGOs have different strengths and capabilities. There is a need to draw upon the expertise of all these stakeholders, and marrying together their complementary skills. We need the right policies and construct for public-social-private partnerships to make this happen.In summary, technological change is accelerating at an unprecedented pace and will change the world as we know it. If we get our act right as a nation over the next decade, technology can help us take India back 1,000 yearswhen we were the most advanced and thriving economy in the world.Neeraj Aggarwal is managing director, and Rohit Ramesh is partner and director at BCG India.",2016-10-19,UoAUwuuIFV498ndi95U3PI,"If we get our act right, technology can help us take India back 1,000 yearswhen we were the most advanced and thriving economy in the world",04:59,Accelarating technology: Indias opportunity to leapfrog
0.09,"Tech Mahindra Ltds shares have risen by about 3% since it announced results last week. It was a rare instance of an Indian IT company reporting a positive earnings surprise. Revenue grew by 1.5% in dollar terms, after adjusting for incremental revenues from acquisitions, according to Nomura Research. This was ahead of the 0.8% analysts were expecting, on an average. 
				   
				For some, such as analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities, the beat on the revenue front was far higher. They had estimated organic revenue growth of just 0.3%. Much of the surprise came from the mainstay telecom business, which grew 2.3% sequentially, after three successive quarters of either flat or negative growth. While the revival in the telecom vertical is heartening, investors seem to be waiting to see if the improvement will sustain. After all, Tech Mahindras valuations continue to languish at less than 12 times estimated earnings for fiscal year 2016-17, and are at a huge discount to other large IT companies. Nomuras analysts point out in a note to clients, Our key concern is why Tech Mahindra is seeing a revival in telecom so late versus Tier-1 IT, for which telecom and media is the fastest-growing vertical at 15% y-y growth in constant currency terms in 2Q versus -3% y-y at Tech Mahindra and is it a case of: 1) Tech Mahindra losing share or 2) client specific or concentration issues or 3) the portfolio having a lower skew towards transformational work.Even so, the companys overall performance in the September quarter should reassure investors. For instance, its top five clients grew for the second straight quarter after six quarters of sluggishness. Besides, deal wins were fairly strong. Margins fell by 50 basis points, although this was on expected lines because of the full quarter impact of acquisitions and a one-off restructuring cost.  A basis point is 0.01%.While all this is good and the stocks cheap valuations are compelling, that alone may not entice investors. If the improvement in performance continues in the December quarter, some investors may bite.",2016-11-03,UtbM0mAb9hgaOKLRiLUYBI,"While the revival in Tech Mahindras telecom vertical is heartening, investors seem to be waiting to see if the improvement will sustain",07:36,Investors stay unconvinced about Tech Mahindras recovery
0.22,"Donald Trumps ascendency from a billionaire property developer to the man destined to become the 45th president of the United States is nothing short of mercurial, but it is also clouded with many uncertaintieshe attracts a strange and shadowy following of racists; he has never held public office and is, therefore, politically inexperienced; he has odd ideas about how to deal with immigrants; he wants to tear up trade deals; he has been furiously back-pedalling on election pledges; and theres that misogyny.
				   
				To many, this is nothing short of a nightmare.We have known all about all of the above for months. But theres one area of concern that is only now being addressedthe potential of huge conflicts of interest. What does the advent of a billionaire businessman into the White House mean for good governance, particularly when the entrant is from an industryproperty constructionknown to be rife with corruption?Are we about to see the emergence of the kind of kleptocracies that were known to plunder the national resources of countries back in the Cold War days, with those stolen resources then making their way to secure banks and other assets in the West? A small number of US newspapers have used the word kleptocracy in commentaries about Trumps conflict of interest, but that may be an over-stretch.It is also true that kleptocracies have survived the Cold War in countries such as Pakistan (Asif Ali Zardari), Egypt (Hosni Mubarak) and Nigeria (Sani Abacha). And conflicts of interest have tended to crop up in democracies across the world, including the US and UK.One recent Asian example is Thaksin Shinawatra, the billionaire media mogul who was prime minister of Thailand from 2001 to 2006. Credited with rolling out policies that benefited the rural poor, healthcare and economic growth, Thaksins later years in power were marred by increasingly strident protests over charges of corruption and conflicts of interest. While infrastructure projects were executed, many benefited companies owned by his family. Amid increasing political instability, the Army took over in 2006 and Thaksin, convicted in his homeland, fled to the UK, where he bought the Premier League football club Manchester City for nearly £82 million. Thaksins fabulous wealth (some £4 billion was said to have been frozen by the UK) is comparable to that of Trump, who, according to Fortune magazine this year, is worth $3.7 billion. The magazine, which has scoured the Trump business for 35 years, says his fortunes fell $800 million this year, mainly on account of a softening of New York Citys real estate market, particularly in retail and office.Fortunes investigations into 28 Trump assets show his aircraft alone are worth $35 millionmade up of three Sikorsky choppers, a Boeing 757 aircraft and a Cessna. His overseas property management and licensing deals include at least three in IndiaTrump Gurgaon, Trump Towers Pune and Trump Towers Mumbai, although these luxury condos merely pay Trump to use his name, according to Fortune.Already, according to The Economic Times, Trump has taken time off his busy transition schedule last week to meet with three Indian real estate developers from Panchshil Realty and Tribeca Developers in New York. But Indian property developers wont be the only ones lining up at Trump Towers in New Yorkor may be even Washingtonin search of business opportunities. That is the nature of business. Far more important is how Trump himself approaches such business opportunities. So far, the signs have been decidedly mixed. On the one hand, he recognizes that there is a potential for conflict. The president of the United States is allowed to have whatever conflicts he or she wantsbut I dont want to go by that, he has said. And: In theory, I dont have to do anything, but I would like to do somethingI would like to try and formalize something. I dont care about my business. I dont want to have people saying conflict.But in his very first meeting with a British political figurehis friend and leading Brexiter Nigel Farageafter winning the election, he brought up his objections to a planned wind farm near a luxury golf course he owns in Scotland. Andy Wigmore, a former Brexit communications chief who attended the meeting, said, Mr. Trump kept returning to  the issue of wind farms. He is dismayed that his beloved Scotland has become over-run with ugly wind farms which he believes are a blight on the stunning landscape.When newspapers reported this incident, and other similar incursions of business in his initial political interactions, Trump appeared to lose his temper. Prior to the election, it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world. Only the crooked media makes this a big deal! he wrote on Twitter.Trump is not the first billionaire to want to be president of the US. Ross Perot in 1992 tried to do the same. You cannot possibly legislate to keep millionaires and billionaires from contesting elections in democracies. But the trend increasinglyand this is in line with predictions by 19th century European economists and political scientistsis that of convergence of big business, political power and the media.For anyone worried about the health and future direction of democracies, this above all should be their biggest nightmare, not the ascendance of individuals, however wealthy. That is the real danger from conflict of interest.Dipankars Twitter handle is @Ddesarkar1",2016-12-02,Vr8ZjiLocntMfsaiks5u1J,"What does the advent of a billionaire businessman into White House mean for good governance, particularly when the entrant is from an industry (property construction) known to be rife with corruption",00:57,Donald Trumps biggest problem: conflict of interest
-0.06,"Delhi and Mumbai are such important markets for Indias top telcos that they have allocated over a third of all their investments in spectrum on these two markets. Not so for Idea Cellular Ltd. Less than 11% of its total outlay for spectrum purchases since 2010 has gone to these markets. 
				   
				And these arent the only markets the company has remained underinvested in after the latest spectrum auction. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities wrote in a note to clients that while Idea Cellulars pan-India ambitions remain, it still has a weak mobile broadband footprint in five large marketsDelhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The company has only a single 3G or 4G carrier in these markets, compared to multiple FDD and TDD carriers acquired by its larger competitors. Lets face itIdea doesnt have a parent that can write a $7 billion cheque. Building strong capacity in these markets is an expensive affair; Idea has to use its resources judiciously and direct them to markets where it has a high share, says an analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage firm. To be sure, Idea Cellulars investments in the remaining 17 circles are even higher than those of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone India Ltd. In the above-mentioned five markets, Idea Cellular has a relatively low market share, which means that its customers in these markets generate low Arpu (average revenue per user) and are unlikely to use 4G services anytime soon. As such, the firms strategy in these markets appears to be to compete largely in the low-end of the market, with some broadband capacity to cater to those who want to upgrade. Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd have acquired significant capacity in these markets, which will result in faster connectivity as well as the ability to handle large volumes of data. High Arpu customers will naturally gravitate to one of these companies. A moot question from Idea Cellulars perspective is if there is a business case at all to continue investing in these markets. Operating in the low-end of the market is a low-margin business, which will get further compressed with the ongoing fall in tariffs after Reliance Jios launch. That Idea sees the possibility of building a business case in these circles at some point is a bold assumption, but gritty bold moves are not new to the company, Kotaks analysts say in their note. Vodafone India , despite the $7 billion cheque from its parent company, decided to stay without either 3G or 4G capacity in five marketsAndhra Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir. These markets account for 19% of the industrys revenues, and about 9.5% of  the companys revenue. So, while both companies have a pan-India presence as far as voice services go, their mobile broadband footprint is either weak or absent in some markets. The rumoured merger between the two companies can fill these gaps; although, needless to say, the exercise will be far from straightforward.",2016-10-12,VwoO7urRII2GJC1OVrFUJM,"While both Vodafone and Idea have a pan-India presence as far as voice services go, their mobile broadband footprint is either weak or absent in some markets",00:17,Behind Vodafone and Ideas low-key investments in some key markets
0.76,"New Delhi: The annual Yes Bank Transformation Series in which Mint is a knowledge partner, is focused this year on innovation and impact as the key drivers of growth and productivity. Designing a solution to redefine Indias solar energy market to conceptualizing an ecosystem for Indias fintech start-ups or laying the road map for a cashless Indian economy, these are some of the case study challenges provided by this years contest for teams from B-schools in India and across the world.
				   
				Launched in 2010, the Yes Bank Transformation Series is a unique platform that offers students across the world an opportunity to work on real-life industry challenges faced by the financial sector and urges them to push the envelope, in a bid to transform Innovation to Impact. Over the years, the focus has been on various disruptive concepts such as digital financial inclusion and complete digitalization. So far, more than 35,000 students have participated in this challenge, making it Indias largest case study challenge.Rana Kapoor, managing director and chief executive of Yes Bank, said: At Yes Bank, it is our constant endeavour to interact with the young minds and channelize their entrepreneurial spirit in the right direction with an emphasis on Innovation. The Yes Bank Transformation Series is a great opportunity for aspiring students to put themselves in the shoes of business leaders, test their mettle against the world and showcase their innovative thinking. I strongly believe that this case study challenge will help us find the next big thinkers and innovators of the country.The Yes Bank Transformation Series is an attempt towards nurturing and promoting the talent inherent in the brightest young minds of the country, while also infusing the spirit of DICE: Design, Innovation and Creativity-led Entrepreneurship in them. The central idea is establishing a nationwide Innovation Lab that would create a sustained culture of growth, entrepreneurship and innovation in India. The challenge has seen the series climb new heights this year, with participation from more than 25,000 students across the top B-schools of India including Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ahmedabad; IIM, Calcutta; IIM, Lucknow; IIM, Indore; Indian School of Business (ISB), Hyderabad; Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT); National Institute of Industrial Engineering (NITIE), Mumbai; IIM, Kozhikode; and IIM, Shillong among others. In this edition, the Yes Bank Transformation Series has emerged as Indias largest case study challenge for B-school students. Using a mix of digital and social media and with a strong focus on innovation, the competition engaged with more than 300,000 students from across the world.Innovative use of social mediaOne of the unique aspects of the fifth edition of the Yes Bank Transformation Series was the innovative use of social and digital media to interact and engage with the student community. The core idea was to reach and engage young minds in the language they converse inat the places they frequent the mostsocial media.The campaign spread across Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn and helped facilitate interactions with more than 300,000 students across the world.Coming up on social mediaMeet your mentor: This will provide an opportunity for budding entrepreneurs to interact with the advisory council via Twitter chats and LinkedIn and get live answers to their queries.Innovation focus: An awareness campaign to highlight the key disruptive innovations in financial services industry that redefined the boundaries of the industry.Innovation Quiz: This quiz on disruptive innovation and the questions will focus solely around innovations which changed the facets of the industry in which they were conceived.Prelims of Edition V of Yes Bank Transformation Series: The preliminary round saw four diverse organizations addressing four key issues in the fintech space. Taisys Technologies, an organization which in collaboration with Yes Bank has created a unique solution which enables feature phone users to access essential banking services, T-Hub, Indias largest incubator, which is creating a comprehensive centre of excellence to accelerate and scale-up fintech start-ups with Yes Bank, Zaggle Prepaid Ocean Services Pvt. Ltd, a prepaid solution provider, and Ezetap Mobile Solutions Pvt. Ltd, one of the worlds largest mobile point of sale (m-PoS) solution providers, shared their challenges with students around the world.In this round, the top participating institutions were divided into four groups, each addressing one of the aforementioned case studies. Here is a bit about the case studies: TaisysThe case from Taisys focused on the Sim-Se-pay solution launched by Taisys with Yes Banka wafer-thin sticker which can be stuck on any type of SIM card of any telco service providerstandard, micro and nano. This sticker installs a sim tool kit-based app which can be accessed by the consumer on any mobile phone without the need for Internet connection.This Sim-Se-Pay wafer is linked to a prepaid wallet which can be loaded by the consumer to perform various types of transactions. The case challenged students to work on increasing commercial usages and socio-commercial usages of the SIM Sleeve and create a comprehensive marketing strategy for the same.T-HubThe second case focused on the unique public/private partnership between T-Hub, the government of Telangana, three of Indias premier academic institutes (IIIT-H, ISB and NALSAR) and key private sector leaders. It stands at the intersection of the start-up, academic, corporate, research and government sectors, and Yes Bank.In April 2016, Yes Bank signed a memorandum of understanding  with T-Hub to create a centre of excellence (CoE), to enable the Indian start-ups across segments with primary focus on fintech. This association will help create a conducive business environment and support system for a large number of fintech start-ups. In addition, Yes Bank will offer its various products and payment gateways and open application program interfaces (APIs) to the start-up community. This challenge tasked the worlds finest minds to create an innovation strategy to leverage the relationship between Yes Bank and T-Hub and to create a holistic innovation program for fintech start-ups, as well as to create a detailed marketing strategy and implementation programme to promote the CoE initiative in a cluttered and highly competitive market.Zaggle In case 3, the focus shifted to Zaggle one of Indias fastest growing prepaid card companies with over 1,000 corporates and 600,000 cards (Visa/Master/proprietary platform) in circulation.Yes Bank and Zaggle have entered into an association to offer prepaid cards to Yes Bank customers. Zaggle has aligned itself with Yes Bank as a total solution provider for its prepaid instruments services across India. This collaboration formally marked Zaggles first engagement with Yes Bank to issue prepaid gift cards and subsequently follow it up with other prepaid cards and allied products with respect to digital payments. This collaboration with Yes Bank would enable Zaggle to further cement its position as a leader in the digital payments space.The case challenged the students to device a cashless innovative pre-paid solution for individuals, giving employers a hassle free product construct and the recipient a potent solution with a wide bouquet of options along with a focused marketing strategy.EzetapThere has been much talk about the gradual shift to a cashless society and the fourth case in the Yes Bank Transformation Series focused on that. This case was shared by Ezetapthe fastest growing mPoS company in India today. Since launching in 2011, Ezetap has over 80,000 terminals deployed in the market, processing over $2.5 million in gross transaction value daily.Despite the phenomenal growth of mobile wallet and m-PoS providers in the country, there is a still major reliance on cash transactions (almost 94% transactions are cash-based). Bright young minds across the world were tasked with devising a strategic road map for Ezetap to tap this huge potential market (there is a potential of 19-20 million PoS  terminals in India while currently only around a million exist). Students were also advised to integrate the revolutionary UPIUnified Payment Interface technology.Campus connectAfter a gruelling opening round, the top five teams were identified by senior leaders from the partner organizations and Yes Bank leaders. The Yes Bank Transformation Series hosted campus challenges across the top 25 campuses in the country to identify the 15 finalist teams of the challenge. The campus round saw students ideas being judged on criteria such as research methodology, understanding of current regulatory framework, depth of analysis of core issues, innovation quotient, and feasibility of implementation and scalability.Apart from naming the winners and runners-up in the campus round, additional prizes were given away for the most innovative idea, most implementable solution, best marketing plan, and Y-Star presenter. This year saw a number of online engagements that generated a huge buzz in the student community. For instance, prior to the campus rounds, teams that submitted their entries before 21 August were eligible for the early-bird submission prize. There was also a Cheatcode Day, through which the top five winners got the opportunity to have their queries addressed by the case-study partner.Students were equally ecstatic about the competition and shared their feedback. Said Janaki Thakkar, student at IIM, Ahmedabad: This year, the theme was around Innovation and National Impact, and the case study we received was a live project Yes Bank was working on. This made the competition appealing, knowing that our work would add value to the organization, and hence we decided to participate. Of course, the attractive prizes helped! Since we worked on a live problem statement at Yes Bank Transformation Series, the competition gave us an opportunity to apply our classroom learnings to real world scenarios. Further, this competition helped us in exploring the current trends across various sectors and keep us informed about recent developments in the business world. While working on this case, we not only looked into developing marketing plan for the target group but also multiple use-cases that would add value to the customers. Says Pramod Suresh of ISB Hyderabad: The transformation series was a challenging competition which required the use of both our left and right brains to arrive at creative yet logical solutions to an actual problem. Yes Bank and T-Hubs brand ensured that there would be stiff competition. The competition exposed us to the accelerator and fintech ecosystem. It also pushed us to think on new disruptive business models. We also got a holistic exposure into various facets of business and also helped polish the soft skills.According to Rashmi Yadawad of IIM, Calcutta: A competition like Yes Bank Transformation Series gives me an opportunity to know about this in detail and stay updated with the current industries and trends. Apart from knowing about current industries and trends, direct interactions with officials from Yes Bank and Ezetap gave me insights from their perspective, a direct picture of what they have already tried. Competing with the campus winners across different B-school campuses will also give me more learnings and the fire to give my best!The grand finaleIn a first-of-its-kind collaboration, the ministry of new and renewable energy, Government of India, shared a challenge focusing on popularizing solar energy with the 15 finalist teams. The final case study will provide a gruelling test to Indias future business leaders. After proving their worth in real-life business cases, the finale takes them to uncharted territories as they pit their wits on a challenge of national importance. The final case challenges finalists to provide innovative financial solutions for solar, or photovoltaic, installations while also creating a strategy for solar consumer products.India is now at a juncture when we must turn to solar to power our future. The government is fully committed to boosting generation and use of solar energy and aims to add 1,00GW of solar power by 2022. The non-polluting nature of solar energy further underlines its status as the most preferred fuel. We must look to integrate solar energy with the lives of the common Indian by making it cheaper, more reliable and easier to connect to grid. High quality research, technological advancements and innovative financing solutions are the means to ensure solar energy becomes affordable and accessible to all. In this regard, I am happy to note that the Yes Bank Transformation Series will see teams from top B-schools in India offering innovative and path breaking ideas regarding the future growth of solar as a medium of energy. I look forward to receiving some valuable insights and suggestions from the sharp young brains and wish them all the best, said A.K. Tripathi, adviser, ministry of new and renewable energy.The grand finale will be held in New Delhi on 16 and 17 November, where the finalists will get to present their ideas to a jury comprising industry experts and mentors. To kick off the final proceedings of the case challenge, Yes Bank will conduct a curtain-raiser on 16 November in New Delhi, where the final 15 teams will get the opportunity to fine-tune their solutions with the advisory council. They will also get to hear the success stories of some of Indias most successful start-up founders as they prepare to start their own quest to entrepreneurship.On 17 November, the teams will present their solutions to the jury, who will pick three winning teams that present the most innovative ideas that can create an impact.

0.1,"Mumbai: The board of Tata Sons Ltd on Monday replaced Cyrus P. Mistry as chairman, less than four years after he took the helm, and named his predecessor Ratan Tata interim chairman for four months.
				   
				The board of the group holding company did not specify a reason for the abrupt move, which was announced after markets closed.Tata Sons in its collective wisdom and on the recommendations of the principal shareholders decided that it may be appropriate to consider a change for the long-term interest of Tata Sons and Tata group, a spokesperson said. A selection committee comprising Ratan Tata, Venu Srinivasan, Amit Chandra, Ronen Sen and Kumar Bhattacharyya was given the mandate of finding a replacement for Mistry, 48, who became chairman of the $103 billion conglomerate in December 2012, at the end of Tatas over two-decade tenure at the top. The board was given four months to complete the task. In the interim, the board has requested me to perform the role of chairman and I have agreed to do so in the interest of and reassurance to the Tata group, Ratan Tata, 78, said in a statement addressed to colleagues.ALSO READ | Uneasy lies the Tata crownThe development, which portends at least short-term turmoil, comes at a time when the conglomerate, whose business interests range from tea to telecom and salt to software services, has been trying to recast or dispose of the key UK steel business, which it acquired in a $12.9 billion purchase of Corus Group Plc. in 2007 under Ratan Tata.This is quite an unusual situation, unexpected from a group like Tata which stands for its values. This means there could possibly have been some governance issue or some major disagreement with either the style of functioning or decision that Mistry may have taken, said Kavil Ramachandran, professor and executive director at the Thomas Schmidheiny Centre for Family Enterprise at the Indian School of Business.According to a person aware of the development, the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, of which Mistry is a scion and which is estimated to hold an 18% stake in Tata Sons, is protesting the move, paving the ground for what could be a messy battle. About two-thirds of Tata Sons is held by philanthropic trusts such as the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Mistry will continue as a Tata Sons director, the spokesperson cited earlier said. However, the group executive council (GEC), a brainchild of Mistrys, has been disbanded, said a person aware of the development. The GEC page has been pulled down from Tata Sons website as has Mistrys September interview to the in-house magazine in which he stated his views on some of the underperforming companies in the group. Our individual companies need to earn the right to grow, he said in the interview.The boardroom putsch has been some time in the making, according to a person close to Mistry, who asked not to be identified. Differences have surfaced over how Mistry has been dealing with the significant challenges facing the group.Several of Mistrys operational decisions were challenged by Ratan Tata, according to this person.

Its a process that sucks up time and can often miss crucial information.India has been in three wars with its neighbours since independence and the target of numerous cross-border attacks, including in 2008 when Pakistan-based extremists killed more than 160 people in Mumbai. Now the threat from cyber attacks is growing and its vulnerability has been exposed.Some 22,000 pages of data related to submarines that a French government-owned company was building for the Indian navy were leaked to the media last year.Opposition leader Rahul Gandhis Twitter account was hacked in November while the elite National Security Guards website was reportedly defaced with profanity-laden messages for Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month.Our idea starting out was that if the next war is fought on cyber, we need our own weapons, said Wig as he talks through software developed for Indias needs. Innefu got a foot in the lucrative business of government contracts after resolving a thorny test case for a law enforcement agency that wanted to determine the background to an incident along one of Indias borders.The agency handed over two CDs with about 1,500 intelligence documents, including social media snippets, such as posts on planned protests. Innefu had to train the machine to read the agencys language, including abbreviations, and then began extracting information on what happened, who were the main players and how they interacted with each other.Its newest offering Prophecy is modelled on products made by Palantir Technologies, a private security firm whose founders include Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel and whose clientele includes the CIA and the FBI. Prophecy is like an octopus with multiple tentacles that pulls data from multiple places, said Wigs co-founder Abhishek Sharma.ALSO READ: AI pioneer Juergen Schmidhuber wants to build the renaissance machine of the futureWhile the use of AI is commonplace elsewhere in Asia, it is still in its infancy in India.

Banks have started to use AI to target products to customers and doctors are using it in a couple of experiments to map a patients medical history in order to devise new lines of treatment.Work is also underway to create a system that can act as a backbone for all electronic warfare programmes for the Indian army.

IRDAI has expressed reservations to accept the scheme of amalgamation in its current form, said Max on BSE. The boards of HDFC Life and Max in August had signed a three way merger, which would create Indias largest private-sector insurer with total assets more than Rs1.1 trillion and lead to the eventual listing of HDFC Life on stock exchanges.Post the merger Housing Development Finance Corp.

Basically, Irdai wants to ensure that the merger is happening between two life insurance companies only , I.e HDFC Life and MAX Life. Since it is a three step merger process and Max Financial Services, which is an NBFC, is also involved in the scheme, Irda wants to ensure that at no stage any amalgamation is happening between Max Financial and any insurance company. So we have to clarify and disclose to Irdai that the non-insurance businesses , such as the telecom business, of MAX Financial Services will be first demerged into Max India and then only the life insurance business of Max Life will be effectively transferred completely to Max Financial Services and subsequently it will be merged with HDFC Life which will result in the automatic listing of the merged entity said a person involved in the merger process on condition of anonymity. Irda had sought the views and recommendation of solicitor general of India a week back and the latest step by Irda has been taken accordingly it seems.

0.64,"Oil companies are likely to report a decent set of numbers for the December quarter. Singapore gross refining margin (GRM), though lower on a year-on-year basis, has improved sequentially (see chart). Nevertheless, a better refining environment is expected to reflect in the December quarter numbers of Indian refining companies. GRM is a measure of the difference between the per barrel price of crude oil and the value of products distilled from it.
				   
				State-run oil marketing companies (OMCs)Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Indian Oil Corp. Ltdare expected to report a good quarter thanks to a recovery in GRMs and inventory gains. While we assume inventory gains (GRM $1-2 a barrel, marketing segment $1-1.5 a barrel), we think OMCs could surprise, pointed out Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd. OMC stocks have outperformed the BSE Sensex so far this fiscal year. Currently, they trade in the range of about 9-12 times estimated earnings for FY17.For Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), improvement in refining margins is expected to be set off to an extent against muted performance from its petrochemicals business. Analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd expect RILs earnings to be largely flat versus the September quarter. That is because, according to Jefferies, the companys GRM is likely to improve by a more modest $0.7 a barrel to $10.8 a barrel in the December quarter due to a five-week maintenance shutdown at one of its FCC (fluid catalytic cracking) units and sharper improvement in gasoline and fuel oil cracks relative to middle distillate cracks. Middle distillate products account for a relatively higher share of RILs product slate.Secondly, the companys blended petrochemical margin has been slightly lower last quarter. Further, the impact of currency demonetization needs to be watched on the petrochemicals segment. Management commentary on the telecom business and updates on downstream projects will be crucial for the RIL stock, which has underperformed the benchmark Sensex so far this fiscal year.Meanwhile, earnings of upstream oil companiesOil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd and Oil India Ltdare expected to benefit from the strength in crude oil prices. On the flip side, some of those gains are likely to be offset by the 18% cut in domestic gas price.

0.52,"Mumbai: Cyrus Mistry, who was part of the panel tasked to find a successor to Ratan Tata for heading the over $100 billion Tata Group, had himself become a surprise selection only to see his tenure cut short abruptly on Monday within four yearsthe shortest at the conglomerate. 
				   
				The 78-year-old Tata is now part of the selection panel that has been asked to search the next chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, the groups main holding company, within next four months and he would also serve as interim chairman in this period.Also Read: Cyrus Mistry ousted as Tata Sons chairman, Ratan Tata steps inA low-profile man to the extent of being reclusive, Mistry, 48, was a surprise choice to succeed Tata, who retired on 29 December, 2012 as chairman of the one of the countrys oldest business empires. The only second non-Tata to take charge of the group after Nowroji Saklatvala in 1932, Mistry by virtue of his age came in with a lot of promise, specially of continuity when he became chairman of Tata Sonsthe promoter of the major operating Tata companies at the age of 44. However, in nearly four years since he took over the reins of the salt-to-software conglomerate, Mistry had to face many challenges in both domestic and global markets as many of the group companies faced headwinds. He undertook a strategy of divesting assets in contrast to what his successor did. Significant among them is the groups steel business, specially Tata Steel Europe. Earlier this year, the company had completed selling of the European long products business in the UK as well as a mill in France to Greybull Capital. It had also announced plans to sell its UK operations after years of losses, although the company is yet to finalize the sale. In July, Tata groups hospitality firm Indian Hotels Company Ltd (IHCL), which runs Taj Group of hotels, completed sale of Taj Boston hotel for $125 million (about Rs839 crore). The hospitality firm had also sold off 12.7 lakh shares of Belmond (earlier known as Orient Express, which the Tata Group tried unsuccessfully to acquire in Ratan Tatas time) for a consideration of $11.96 million. IHCL had also sold BLUE Sydney, a Taj Hotel, to Australia Hotels & Properties Ltd for AU$ 32 million (nearly Rs179 crore) in 2014. The Tata group is also engaged in a legal battle with Japans Docomo over the split of their telecom joint venture Tata Docomo. Contrary to these developments, Tata led the group into some notable acquisitions, starting from Tetley by Tata Tea for $450 million in 2000 to steelmaker Corus by Tata Steel in 2007 and the landmark Jaguar Land Rover in 2008 for $2.3 billion by Tata Motors. Also read: Uneasy lies the Tata crownWhile the reasons for Mistrys sacking by the Tata Sons board is not clear, according to sources, the decision taken on the suggestion of Tata Trusts. In the long term interest of Tata Sons and the Tata Group, the principal shareholdersTata Trusts suggested to the Board of Tata Sons that it would be appropriate to look for a change and look forward, a source said. When Mistry took over, the Tata Group had a revenue of $100.09 billion in 2011-12. Since then, the groups revenue grew to $103 billion in 2015-16. About 66% of the equity capital of Tata Sons is held by philanthropic trusts endowed by members of the Tata family. The largest of these trusts are the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Sir Ratan Tata Trust, which were created by the families of the sons of Jamsetji Tata, the founder.

Just as the flow of bad news on the compliance front was ebbing, with some affected companies even getting a green signal from the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), comes news of likely action by the Department of Justice (DoJ).
				   
				The DoJ probe on suspected price collusion was already known, as firms had reported being asked to submit documents. That the probe is proceeding and the first set of charges is expected to be filed by the year-end has investors worried.On Friday, the BSE Healthcare Index fell 4.2% and closed with an 8% loss over the previous week. On Monday, things looked calmer. Lupin Ltds announcement that it has got clearance for its Goa plant from USFDA lifted its share price by 6.9%.This clears one major hurdle in its path. The news perked up sentiment for its peers, too, and the sector index closed with a gain of 1.9%, although where USFDA is concerned, it is best to keep hopes in check.Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Dr Reddys Laboratories Ltd are being probed. Bloomberg reported that totally a dozen firms and about two dozen drugs are under investigation. The potential filing of a first set of charges indicates the probe has found some actionable evidence. Thats the first worry. Also, this list can expand if the probe unearths more names. The probe comes in the backdrop of the uproar over rising medicine prices (even if only a dozen drugs figure here) among the US public.The financial hit is one thing. But one also has to contend with the embarrassment of being labelled a company that colluded to fix drug prices. Only when the first set of charges are filed will investors get some idea of what the DoJ has found, whether the charges are grave and, as a corollary, the likely action. But they are right to show concern.Apart from the fallout of this investigation, a bigger one, says Kotak Securities in a research note, is the rhetoric in the presidential campaign on drug pricing. While these may not translate into action, if they do, they can be a bigger headache for pharmaceutical companies.

0.28,"The economic reform process which began dramatically over a few days at the end of July 1991 was a massive collective achievement in a country where any change for the better is stymied by the enemy within. And the plethora of books marking 25 years of that start has been enormously educative in taking us through the internal parlays, and in a few cases subterfuge, which together made it all happen. 
				   
				It is a well-worn cliché to say that the 1991 package was incomplete, and intellectually flawed (which it was), but what we now need is to pick up each thread of the impossible skein of controls wrapped around the Indian economy pre-reform, and see how it has fared over the years, and where it lies right now. We need to recognize that a second important reform impetus happened over 1999-2001 which sprung loose some tightly wound threads, and further straightened out those that had been unwrapped in 1991.Then there were reform initiatives which were talked about in 1991 but not actually introduced at the time. One such is the goods and services tax (GST). The tax reforms committee of 1991, chaired by Raja Chelliah, was tasked in its terms of reference only to look at taxes levied by the centre (this was part of the larger problem of neglect of state participation which characterized that first round of reforms). Even so, it said (para 9.3 of the interim report): It would be ideal if there were one comprehensive VAT (value-added tax) replacing the present system of Central excises, the State sales taxes and other indirect taxes except the State levy on alcoholic liquor... The GST was a brainchild of the fiscal reforms of 1991 although the committee didnt call it by that name.   The constitutional amendment to enable GST finally cleared the Rajya Sabha on 3 August, but the amendments to the bill to make that possible mean that it will have to pass through the Lok Sabha again. Then the GST bill to operationalize the tax will have to be passed, probably only in the next session of Parliament. The tortuous path of GST is possibly the only example of a reform initiative which has actually gained from its extended delay (with the exception of recent segments of it). It was sensible to first attempt value-added taxation separately in the indirect taxation sphere at the centre (the first tentative moves of which happened with MODVAT, or modified value-added tax in pre-reform 1986), and in the sphere of states (begun in 2005 in most states), before attempting to merge the two. Much will now depend on the GST network, a special purpose vehicle appointed to smooth out glitches in the information technology channels so that taxpayers can make their GST payments through a single window. The Compensatory Afforestation Bill of 2016, finally passed in the Rajya Sabha on 28 July, a long time after its passage through the Lok Sabha, is somewhat different from GST. Here is a case which completes a reform begun even earlier in 1980, where nothing whatever has been gained from the delay. On the contrary, there has been only profoundly irreversible loss. This will be fully acknowledged even by those opposed to diversion of forested land to commercial uses such as dams, which was made legally permissible by the Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980, subject to prior approval from the Government of India, and subject to payment of a prescribed sum for compensatory afforestation. Given that enactment, and given that land has already been diverted under its provisions, and compensation paid, even those opposed to forest land diversion will surely agree that such compensation should be actually used for afforestation instead of being locked up as unutilized funds. Which, believe it or not, was the situation until the recently moved bill. If those funds had been ploughed in at the time they were collected, we would actually have fully grown forests in place. What we can hope for at best now, after the bill is passed, is maybe saplings in a years time. Time lost. Environment disprotected. Irretrievable loss.A Supreme Court order dated 30 October 2002, in its judgement on a writ petition, mandated that the amounts payable under the 1980 Act should be deposited in a Compensatory Afforestation Fund. A further Supreme Court direction, dated 5 May 2006, required that in the absence of a formally legislated Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) of the kind that will now come into being with the passage of the 2016 bill, an ad hoc CAMPA be created at the Centre to centrally pool the money recovered on behalf of the said Authority lying in the States and Union territories. This suggests that between 2002 and 2006 the sequestered funding lay where it was collected, at state-level, and that between 1980 and 2002 the unsequestered funds were merged with the general budget under the general head of non-tax receipts, and dealt with, productively or otherwise, by states. Subsequent to the 2006 Supreme Court direction, the money was pooled in an ad hoc CAMPA fund at the centre. Not all was hoardedsome was indeed distributed to states, in proportion to jurisdictional collections. A report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG Report No. 21 of 2013), reports that the annual amount released from the central ad hoc CAMPA to states over the three years 2009-12 amounted to nearly Rs.3,000 crore in aggregate. Even so, the amount remaining at the centre for distribution between states, as mentioned in the preamble to the 2016 bill, is Rs.38,000 crore. This is presumably the collection since 2002, since before that nothing was being accumulated. The sum represents the total collected under several heads covering compensatory afforestation and penalties levied on those who did not take prior approval, added to the net present value of the diverted forest land or cultivated catchment area. Thus the loss in not having used this fund towards afforestation earlier is truly enormous. All that can be hoped for now, going forward, is that the monitoring mechanism proposed in the bill will ensure productive use at ground level of the accumulated funds. As for funds payable on further diversion of forest land, the 2016 bill will hand over 90% of compensatory funds received directly to states. However, the CAG report referred to above presents a very discouraging picture of state capacity to use afforestation funds effectively. The overall utilization by states of funds released over 2009-12 was as low as 61%. Even more worryingly, the utilization rates were lowest in states with high forest cover such as Arunachal Pradesh (9%), Chhattisgarh (33%), Himachal Pradesh (59%) and Meghalaya (0%).What reform has failed to do in every sphere is to improve government capacity for expenditure. Monitoring mechanisms to prevent misdirection of government expenditure merely result in obstructing expenditure altogether. Even in the 2016 bill, the steering committee mandated at state level is chaired by the chief secretary. The time and attention of the senior-most civil servant in the state, thought necessary to secure every process from corruption, becomes so thinly stretched as a result that procedural delays become the norm rather than the exception. Government processes remain substantially unreformed. The accumulation of unspent funds for afforestation, and the low level of utilization of even such funds as were disbursed to states for the purpose, is only a small part of the larger problem of unspent funds (float) lying with governments in all departments. A. Santhosh Mathew, a government officer belonging to the Indian Administrative Service, has written widely to demonstrate how this results from the antiquated system of layered file-based certification of fund utilization. He estimates that a third of reported government expenditure lies parked, unused. A workflow based IT platform for each expenditure programme, such that funds can be transferred in real time from the funding source directly to the point of expenditure, can get rid of this problem of unspent funds. To quote him: a synchronized effort to adopt IT systems across government simply means a dramatic reduction in fiscal deficit, more money for lending to the private sector, a more efficient public financial management system, and a more reliable government to conduct business with.The only reservation I have is that where government systems have been shifted onto automated platforms, automation is typically done through a tender process that selects private players working on wafer-thin margins, who run their systems with poorly paid operators, and face high employee turnover. Add to that problems with electricity, and you have systems that have users tearing their hair in frustration. Very often automated systems ask that users use the manual channel in addition, which then renders redundant the very purpose of automation. But automation with a provision for continued correction through interface with users is clearly the direction in which to move. That alone, however, will not get compensatory afforestation moving on the ground.Indira Rajaraman is an economist.",2016-08-05,YLqbMiTRGk2RemWsBYzQMN,"The tortuous path of GST is possibly the only example of a reform initiative which has actually gained from its extended delay (with the exception of recent segments of it)

-0.08,"San Francisco: America just endured its first presidential election in which the majority of the electorate got its news from social media. And the outcome is already prompting soul searching by the companies that shaped it.
				   
				Facebook Inc. will have to contend with mounting dissatisfaction over its role as the most widely used news filter in history. Forty-four percent of American adults get their media through the site, many consuming news from partisan sources with which they agree. The proliferation of fake news on Facebook has also been a problem: false stories about the Clinton family committing murder and Huma Abedin being a terrorist flew fast and furious despite refutations from responsible news organizations. Those stories shaped public opinion, said Ed Wasserman, the dean of the University of California, Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism.This is a landmark, he said. Trump was able to get his message out in a way that was vastly influential without undergoing the usual kinds of quality checks that we associate with reaching mass public. You had a whole set of media having influence without really having authority. And the media that spoke with authority, the authority that comes after careful fact checking, didnt really have the influence.In a statement, a Facebook spokeswoman said: While Facebook played a part in this election, it was just one of many ways people received their information  and was one of the many ways people connected with their leaders, engaged in the political process and shared their views.Online (on Facebook, of course), current and former employees debated the companys role as an influencer. Bobby Goodlatte, a Facebook product designer from 2008 to 2012, according to his LinkedIn, today said the companys news feed was responsible for fueling highly partisan, fact-light media outlets that propelled Donald Trumps ascension to the presidency. News feed optimizes for engagement, Goodlatte wrote. As weve learned in this election, bullshit is highly engaging. In the past, Facebook has pushed back publicly against these concerns with a simple premise: News feed is just an amplification of what people would experience in a world without it. In response to Goodlatte, Andrew Bosworth, a veteran Facebook executive who helped create news feed, defended the company: News feed isnt perfect but it is at least or more diverse than the alternatives which dominated consumption in the late nineties.Behind the scenes, Facebook has been studying and analyzing its effect on news consumption. The issue was tackled at high-level meetings this summer, leading to a revision of priorities for news feed to de-emphasize media posts, in favour of posts from friends and family. The companys public relations department has worked to frame Facebook as a technology company rather than a media company, celebrating the invention of news feed on its 10-year anniversary, for example. Meanwhile, Facebook intensified its analysis of its role in creating an echo chamber and spreading fake news.We cant read everything and check everything, Adam Mosseri, the head of news feed, said in an August interview. So what weve done is weve allowed people to mark things as false. We rely heavily on the community to report content.Of course, if false news is spreading in communities that want to believe it, few will mark it as false.Echo chambers on Facebook may have helped Trump win, but Twitter Inc. gave him a way to reach American voters constantly and without an editor. Clinton also had her own Facebook and Twitter accounts, but Trump, with almost 14 million followers on the site, would often start his own news cycles with deeply opinionated and often incendiary posts. I cant think of another instance, in commercial or political communication, where Twitter was used as effectively, Wasserman said.Twitters shares rose 4.1% on Wednesday, boosted by investor recognition of its role in the election outcome. But it hasnt all been good for the company. As Trump rose on the platform, so did a set of racist, misogynist harassers supporting him, and that caused a major headache for the company. These trolls, not officially endorsed by the campaign, would regularly attack Trumps critics, in many cases causing Twitter users to feel unsafe. The clashes highlighted Twitters inability to effectively address abuse on its platform  a problem that was one reason The Walt Disney Company walked away from a potential bid for the social media site.Twitters executives, when asked about these issues during the election, said that the site is a place for all ideas. If false information or hateful rhetoric surfaces, others on the site will tweet in response.We have the world talking on this thing about the world, chief executive officer Jack Dorsey said in an interview earlier this year. So we see every spectrum of idea and conversation.Twitter didnt respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.

But this strategy backfired as far as volume growth was concernedvoice volumes fell by 1% sequentially. On a y-o-y basis, voice volumes grew by just 1.8%. We have found Ideas dynamic management of the price-volume equation in the voice business impressive in the past; however, we do believe the company has not managed to strike the right balance of late, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients. In all, revenue grew by 8% y-o-y. At the same time, thanks to a vigorous expansion in its data network coverage, network operating costs rose by 16% y-o-y. Profit margins naturally fell. Adjusted for one-offs, Kotaks analysts estimate Ebitda margins fell 90 basis points y-o-y. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. A basis point is 0.01%.Profit after tax slumped 65%, which was more or less on expected lines, as interest costs almost tripled on network expansion, spectrum renewal and acquisition costs. Tracking the rise in capital expenditure and finance costs, analysts were forecasting a fall in profit. Still, the results have disappointed. While slow revenue growth and a sharp rise in costs weighed on the June quarter performance, the pressure on Idea Cellulars earnings may continue to keep investors on the edge.Hopefully, the company will change tracks with its pricing strategy and voice volume growth may come back on track. Slowing data volume growth is a big worry, however, especially keeping in mind the large amount of investments the company has made in the segment. Besides, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds launch, expected later this year, can worsen competitive dynamics.The silver lining in all this is that Idea Cellulars shares have already underperformed the broader market by a wide margin and valuations are inexpensive. Still, investors may wait for a pickup in performance before committing their capital in the company.",2016-08-09,YSXWKTUpW4lhbZe1KlFOdM,"While slow revenue growth and a sharp rise in costs weighed, the pressure on Idea Cellulars earnings may continue to keep investors on the edge

0.56,"When I first met Suketu Talekar in Pune, back in 2009, Brewcrafts Microbrewing Pvt. Ltd, which produces Doolally craft beers, was still making test batches of ales and ciders. As I watched Talekar, then 32, and German head brewer and co-founder Oliver Schauf, whom he met online when he was looking for a partner, haul sacks of malt and hops from the storage room to the brewery, they had to explain to me the basics of how a beer is made. 
				   
				Beer is, essentially, the shit and piss of yeast, Talekar, Doolallys co-founder, had said, guffawing. They had to carefully list the differences between an industrial beer and a craft one, and why the latter was more desirable. As Indias first microbrewery, Doolallys principal challenge then was simply letting consumers know there was more to beer than Kingfisher and Fosters. Just seven years later, India has more than 30 microbreweries. If youre anywhere in Bengaluru, Pune, Gurgaon or Mumbai, youre not far from a pub that will serve you a craft beer on tap. Even your local wine shop may have bottles of craft beer made by an Indian company. Talekar, who is in charge of Doolallys marketing and salesSchauf handles the making of the beeris neither surprised, nor overly excited, about the rapid growth of a market he helped open up. If you make a good beer, consumers will love it. That was always a no-brainer for me, he says.We are sitting at the Doolally Taproom in Bandra, Mumbai, one of three such outlets in the city. The company, which began selling its beers at The Corinthians Resort & Club in Pune in 2009, brought its brews to Mumbai in 2015. The Bandra Taproom, wholly owned and run by Doolally, was their first outlet, and since then, two more have opened, one in Andheri and another at Kemps Corner. These restaurants are perpetually filled with increasingly knowledgeable beer drinkers who dont even need the menu, let alone an explanation of what craft beer is, to place their order. But the education process has not been completed, says Talekar. We have moved a long way from walking into a bar and asking just for a beer. Now, we walk into a bar and ask for a brand and a stylea Gateway Doppelganger or an Independence IPA (India Pale Ale), he says. Customers know there are possibilities of beer beyond Kingfisher and Fosters. But really understanding what those possibilities are, that is an ongoing process.As that process continues, Talekar expects the industry to grow to a size that will dwarf what is now being heralded as a craft-beer boom. The US has seen the number of microbreweries reach nearly 5,000, even though the first one opened only in the late 1970s, he says. At this early stage in India, he sees other microbreweries more as allies than as competitors. More players means more perspective on the product. It means more experimentation. It means consumers holding brewers to a higher standard, which means improvement on the product.And he is impressed with the quality of entrepreneurs entering the craft beer industry, something he thinks will be critical to the pace it grows at. People are making conservative estimates about the market for craft beer because they are underestimating the quality of the entrepreneurs entering this market. I believe there is a qualitative difference between the early bunch of winemakers and the early bunch of craft-beer makers. I will put my money behind a statement that in five years, craft beer will be 2x or 3x bigger than the wine industry. Which would mean that in 10 years, we would have done what the wine guys havent managed to do in 25 years. And thats because of the quality of the entrepreneurs.One of the stumbling blocks for the craft-beer industry has been the red tape one has to navigate to begin making craft beer and, then, package it in a way that is profitable. A number of breweries have complained that without being allowed to bottle their beers, they are left with too few revenue streams to break even. Talekar thinks the extent of these problems is overstated. Doolally has joined hands with a few other breweries to form the Maharashtra Craft Brewers Association, and they are seeking, among other things, permission from the excise department to sell beer in growlers (air-tight jugs used to store beer) at brewpubs. It will be like parcelling beer, like you parcel food at a restaurant, Talekar explains. Someday, he would also like to see Doolally beers sitting in bottles in stores. But at the moment he is not fixated on finding new ways to package and sell his beer. Rather, his days are spent managing Doolallys Taprooms and ensuring that he wins with every consumer who walks in. Doolallys Taprooms have become popular in Mumbai as places for relaxed get-togethers. They are brightly lit, unlike other pubs; the music is soft, allowing conversation; and the walls are lined with shelves full of books and board games, suggesting this is a place you will not be hurried in. Talekar understands that the context in which he sells his beer is as important as the product. We believe that people dont come here to eat and drink. They come here for something else. They come here to spend time with friends, someone they love or their colleagues. Its like an extension of their living rooms. Born in Gujarats Bhavnagar and schooled in Nashik, Talekar did a course in production engineering from the Jawaharlal Nehru College in Aurangabad. After a stint with his fathers company, which did sales and after-sales service of diesel engines, Talekar completed his masters in business administration from the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, in 2004. He then worked as an assistant brand manager with Procter & Gamble in Singapore. He had always been a beer drinker, but had never drunk truly good beer until he began frequenting a brewpub named Brewerkz there. He returned to India a year later with the idea of bringing good beer to his home country. His conservative family wasnt too happy; they didnt think decent people should be dealing in liquor.After a decade-long journey with BrewCrafts Microbrewing/Doolally, Talekar is doing things he had never imagined he would. Such as managing a pub. We only began running our first 18 months ago, and now we have three, without raising any money. What Ive learnt in this time is that there is no greater marketing tool than experiential retail. You can actually moderate how a person feels. Thats why every Apple store is worth a hundred million dollars that Microsoft spends on advertising. Doolallys beer sales have grown 400% since 2014 and their total revenue has increased by 1,000% in the same period. Theyve also added to their staff, currently at around 180, and have moved from working out of the Taprooms to an office in Santacruz. With this pace of growth, employees come to work every day knowing they are going to have to face new challenges, which is why Talekar sees his role as that of a cheerleader. I believe in letting people be. I think that if you recruit right, then your job is to create conditions that will let people succeed and give them the leeway to make decisions and mistakes too. Its natural when you are doing so many new things for morale to dip at times. My job is to get everyone excited about the big picture.",2016-11-11,YuwrGySpWqY8lwy1eIWdqN,Why the co-founder of the hugely successful Doolally craft beers thinks the Indian craft-beer industry will be twice the size of the wine industry in five years,12:51,Suketu Talekar: Master brewer

				Backing Munjals ambitious plan is around $125 million cash that International Finance Corp.

0.34,"Vodafone Group Plc has said it is considering a merger of its Indian subsidiary with Idea Cellular Ltd. If the two companies agree, they will settle for a reverse merger, obviating the need for an IPO (initial public offering) by Vodafone India Ltd.
ALSO READ | Vodafone confirms Idea merger talks, could create Indias biggest telecom firmInvestors in telecom stocks, who had turned wary after Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds relentless onslaught, lapped up the news of possible consolidation in the sector. The market capitalization of Vodafone India, Idea Cellular and Bharti Airtel Ltd cumulatively rose by $4 billion on Monday. Shares of Idea Cellular and Bharti Airtel are now 4-5% higher compared to levels before Reliance Jios launch. While its true that a merger can result in meaningful synergies, investors are perhaps being overly sanguine about the sectors prospects post-consolidation.An analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage firm points out, Competitive intensity doesnt merely depend on the number of companies fighting for share; it largely depends on the strategy of the most credible challenger in the fight for market share. In other words, Reliance Jio will still hold the key to the sectors competitive dynamics.In fact, if the Vodafone India-Idea Cellular combine materializes, it may well inspire more competitive moves by Reliance Jio. Klaus Uhlenbruck et al., researchers based in the US, say in a paper titled Rivals reactions to mergers and acquisitions: Under conditions where rivals have significant resources to respond to a competitors acquisition or when rivals consider an acquisition to be a threat to their market position, they respond with a heightened number of actions, perhaps with greater breadth and complexity. On that note, besides Reliance Jio, even Bharti Airtel has the capacity to use significant resources to respond to the new market structure. Vodafones idea for an escape route from its Indian tormentAnd they might well have an upper hand, as Vodafone India and Idea Cellular navigate the troubled waters of integrating two very large companies. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a 24 January note to clients, The focus of a merged entity could shift toward integration, thus diverting management attention from market dynamics. We believe that both Vodafone and Idea are behind Airtel and Jio in their 4G rollout strategy and any resulting material delay in rollout would lead to some market share loss in the long run. See chart for a previous M&A (merger and acquisition) involving Vodafone that faced integration issues. While Ebitda margins have improved lately, the joint venture continues to report net losses.  Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.Of course, all of this is not to say that a Vodafone India-Idea Cellular merger doesnt make sense. Reliance Jios enormous investment in the sectoraround $30 billion for an industry with revenues of $27 billionis driving down profits and cash flow of incumbents on the one hand, and forcing them to up investments on the other. As a result, for companies such as Idea Cellular, leverage will soon reach alarming proportions.A merger will result in a stronger balance sheet, and can potentially result in higher profit margins. As such, it will provide the merged company more firepower to take on Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel. Having said this, it is too much to expect it to be a panacea. Since Vodafone India and Idea Cellular are both behind the curve in terms of investments and their broadband network rollouts, they have little time to lose. The success of the merger will depend largely on the structure the new company adopts. While an organization structure that allows nimble moves is an imperative, it remains to be seen if this is possible in a company that has two large investors with equal rights.",2017-01-31,ZL7jov9xOFIyVndDXEMN7K,The likely merger of Vodafone  and Idea may well inspire more competitive moves by Reliance Jio,07:44,A Vodafone and Idea merger is no panacea for the telecom sector
0.07,"Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is likely to report a gain in  quarterly profit as a strong performance in its refining business may help offset weaker petrochemical margins. 
				   
				Net profit, excluding those of its units, may increase to Rs7,842 crore on a revenue of Rs65,752.6 crore for the three months ended 31 December, according to a Bloomberg survey of 11 analysts. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported a profit of Rs7,218 crore on revenue of Rs56,567 crore. RIL will announce its third-quarter earnings on Monday. At 9.15am, RIL was trading at Rs1,091.40 on BSE, up 0.11% from previous close while Indias benchmark Sensex Index rose 0.01% to 27,238.35 points.We expect this to be the eighth consecutive sequential earnings increase. Strong refining should more than offset the likely weaker pet-chem segment (weaker margins, and likely impact of demonetization), Nomura Research said in a 5 January note to clients. Analysts expect RILs gross refining margin (GRM) to be between $10.5 per barrel and $11.5 per barrel. GRM is the realization from turning every barrel of crude oil into finished products. Reliances GRM is likely to improve by a more modest $0.7 per barrel to $10.8 per barrel in third quarter due to a five-week maintenance shutdown in one of its fluid catalytic cracking units and sharper improvement in gasoline and fuel oil cracks relative to middle distillate cracks, brokerage Jefferies India said in a 4 January note. During the quarter, benchmark Singapore complex margins increased by $1.5 per barrel sequentially to $6.7 per barrel. RILs petrochemical business is estimated to report a drop in EBIT on overall weaker margins, planned shutdown and impact of demonetization. EBIT stands for earnings before interest and taxes and is an indication of a companys profitability. Petchem will be impacted by demonetization and lower spreads. Consequently, we estimate EBITDA to dip 6% quarter-on-quarter, Edelweiss Securities said in a 6 January note. During the December quarter, RIL commissioned the first phase of its paraxylene capacity. Analysts expect RILs new refining and petchem projects to add to earnings from the second half of FY18-19. On the exploration and production front, RIL is likely to report a small loss. US shale will continue to remain loss-making. Crude oil prices are higher year-on-year but domestic gas prices are lower. KG D6 production is expected to be down 24% on a YoY (year-on-year) basis. US shale is consolidated with one quarter lag, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a report dated 9 January. Analysts expect the companys telecom business to be a drag on profitability. RIL launched its telecom operations commercially on 5 September. Post its second-quarter results announcement on 20 October, RIL said the company will be investing an additional Rs1 trillion in its telecom venture. RIL has so far invested Rs2 trillion in the venture. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd  (RJio), which launched an inaugural free voice and data plan beginning 5 September, extended it beyond December till 31 March. Over the past one month, competitive intensity has picked up, as incumbent telecom companies have started to offer higher data for free for 4G subscribers and effectively brought down pricing.

0.56,"Investors in Internet start-ups and growth-stage companies have to traverse a strange universe. The closest parallel I can find is the film industry. As a producer (investor), I might have all the right ingredientsa star-studded cast, a fantastic storyline, chart-busting music scores, breathtaking sets and cinematography, and a visionary directorbut whether or not the film does well at the box office is still somewhat of a gamble. You never know whether the reagents are just right to serve up a blockbuster.Except with the Internet start-up, its even worse since there is another twistthe simple fact that there are a bunch of other start-ups with the exact same storyline! This would be akin to several independent production houses producing the same James Bond movie (since they all own the idea or franchise)at the same time and trying to bring it to the market as fast as possible. This means that there are multiple, simultaneous, identical experiments all taking place at the same time, and no one knows who will win.But wait, I hear you say; doesnt the one who is first to the market end up winning since they will have the first-mover advantage? Well, not necessarily. The me too scenario also works. And not just with the Lyfts and Olas who are replicating Uber today. History also shows us this. Yahoo was the first, true large-scale search engine. It was upended by Google, which, apart from having (at the time) a better search algorithm, also quickly added other chemical reagents to the mixfree email, Web hosting, smartphone software, smart glasses and so on. The result? Googles market capitalization, as I write this, is almost 14 times that of Yahoo$517 billion compared to Yahoos $35 billion. I remember burning my fingers by investing in Yahoo prior to the dot-com burst of 2001. The stock first fell like a stoneand then remained at the bottom of the pond for years thereafter, before staging a weak comeback afterwards. Its still around, and is still a great company, but a Google it is not. And as a footnotewhile Yahoo went public in 1996, Google didnt go public until almost eight-and-a-half years later in 2004which in Internet terms is like a day and night of Brahma8.64 billion solar years, to be precise.In the interim, Yahoo, the firm, has had several chief executivesBartz, Morse, Thompson, Levinsohn and Mayer. (That string sounds almost like the name of a white-shoe law firm.) Not so Google, where, though Indias own Sundar Pichai is now CEO, the founding team of Larry Page, Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt agreed to work together for 20 years after the IPO (until 2024). Page handed the reins over to Pichai only last year, but still remains very involved.The same analogy can be drawn with our own earlier generation of labour arbitrage-based start-ups: the technology services firms. Firms like Infosys, Cognizant and Mindtree, while sometimes criticized for the collegiality of their founding teams, have ended up having had the last laugh despite having had to weather financial crises before. All said and done, Infosyslike Cognizant, Tata Consultancy Services and some other large Indian services companies with stable management teamsis now a global champion, and Mindtree is a strong contender in the next rung.Maybe there are lessons to be learnt from this for Indias array of current start-ups, which saw a market arbitrage opportunity to enter the Internet retail space before their larger global counterparts could enter the market, essentially creating the equivalent of Jack Mas Chinese Alibaba. Flipkart and Snapdeals valuations seem to have hit a wall. Much of the publicity associated with this has been focused on the fact that foreign investors, afraid of a global slowdown and unproven business models, have written down their existing investments in the sector and are unwilling to pony up more cash. And the global market leader, Amazon, has entered the Indian market in a big way.The current bearish scenario in international markets will surely change, just as it did post-2001 and then again post-2008, so the trick is just to hold on and fend off Amazons advance until the financial tide turns. Despite recent changes in the law, Amazon is after all not an Indian firm and will face more hurdles than the home-grown rivals. But, meanwhile, instead of signing long-term agreements to work together and weather what is just a simple financial stormso that they can later go public and monetize their holdingsmany senior executives at these firms seem to be using the revolving door.Just like in the movies, you can only have one or two heroes/heroines in the cast. And the same is true of the villains. Similarly each start-up can only have one or two sultans or sultanas, but constancy in the top teams is vital. Google has its Page, Facebook its Zuckerberg, Alibaba its Ma, and Snapdeal and Flipkart have their Bahl and Bansals. But the sultans need to think of Henry Fords maxim when it comes to business: Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success. A series of cameo appearances does not a blockbuster make.Siddharth Pai is a world-renowned technology consultant who has personally led over $20 billion in complex, first-of-a-kind outsourcing transactions.",2016-04-20,ZQFsl3WTYrbJ5oGFrfBQFM,"Each start-up can only have one or two sultans or sultanas, but constancy in the top teams is vital

0.5,"Mumbai/Tokyo/Chicago: The emergence of Shahid Khan, the NFL team owner who made his fortune selling car bumpers, in the race to rescue embattled Japanese airbag manufacturer Takata Corp. pits the billionaire against more established parts suppliers and some of the worlds biggest buyout firms.
				   
				Pakistan-born Khan, 66, migrated as a teenager to the US, where he started washing dishes for $1.20 an hour. He later built Urbana, Illinois-based Flex-N-Gate Corp. into an auto-parts supplier that ranks him among the richest Americans, with an estimated net worth of about $5 billion. Along the way, he bought the Jacksonville Jaguars in Florida and the London-based Fulham Football Club, and landed on a cover of Forbes magazine in 2012 as the Face of the American Dream.Now, Khans bumper-and-headlight maker is one of five suitors for Tokyo-based Takata, which is looking for a buyer after some of its devices ruptured and killed at least 16 people, prompting repairs that could exceed 100 million devices worldwide, according to a person familiar with the matter.Flex-N-Gate, which doesnt make airbags, will go up against established suppliers such as Stockholm-based Autoliv Inc., Chinese-owned Key Safety Systems Inc. and Japans Daicel Corp. Private equity firms KKR & Co. and Bain Capital, partnering with Daicel, are also said to have submitted bids.Automakers may prefer an established company as a buyer compared with Flex-N-Gate, said Kavan Mukhtyar, a management consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Mumbai who has advised on strategy and operations in the automotive industry. But considering its global aspirations, Flex-N-Gate can offer better valuations. And in a deal, valuation plays a critical role.Proposals from Takata buyers are being discussed at meetings scheduled in Japan this week between the supplier and automakers including Honda Motor Co. The central issue for the airbag makers customers is how those takeover bids divide up the responsibility for billions of dollars in recall costs and liabilities.Representatives for Flex-N-Gate and Takata declined to comment on the bids. Flex-N-Gate declined to make Khan available for an interview.Track record
A lack of a track record in making airbags may count against Flex-N-Gate in its bid for Takata, said Koji Endo, an analyst with SBI Securities Co. in Tokyo. Airbags are an area where the margins are relatively high and the hurdles for new entrants are also high, Endo said.Automakers have said ensuring a stable and reliable supply of airbags is one of their top priorities, even as they seek longer-term engineering solutions and to diversify their supplier base.Khan may be able to make up for a lack of experience in airbags with the work ethic thats propelled his career, according to Jim Womack, whos authored several books on lean manufacturing and has spoken with the billionaire about his upbringing in Pakistan.Khan recalled playing golf with his father where fairways were lined with beggars whod throw back errantly hit balls in exchange for tips. Womack said Khan left for America to escape a country where one couldnt lose.Driven guy
He can walk through a factory and have a real sense of whats going on, unlike a thousand CEOs Ive met whove never done what some of us would call real work, said Womack, the founder of and senior adviser to Lean Enterprise Institute Inc. Hes a driven guy. Not an awful guy but hes in this to win.Khan, whose father sold surveying equipment and mother was a math professor in Pakistan, began working for Flex-N-Gate while still an engineering student, according to a profile posted on the Jacksonville Jaguars website.Flex-N-Gate at the time used to make auto bumpers by welding together different pieces. Khan sought and succeeded in coming up with a seamless bumper that would be easier to manufacture, Khan said on stage in 2014 at Chicago Ideas Week.He left the company to set up Bumper Works, which designed and manufactured lightweight seamless fenders, landing General Motors as its first customer, Khan said at the Chicago forum. Two years later Khan purchased his former employer when it came up for sale and folded Bumper Works into Flex-N-Gate.Business expansion
Over the next decade, Khan led the transition of Flex-N-Gate from an after-market parts producer to an original equipment manufacturer. He expanded by acquiring businesses including mechanical assembly supplier Ventra Group Inc. in 2001, the bumper business from Meridian Automotive Systems in 2009 and a headlamps and taillights business from Ford Motor Co.The company counts major automakers including Ford, Volkswagen AG, Toyota Motor Corp. and Suzuki Motor Corp. its customers and operates 54 manufacturing facilities globally.For Khan, buying Takata will give him an estimated 22% global market share in airbags, a business that Autoliv forecasts may expand to $10.3 billion by 2018 from $9.5 billion in 2015, as emerging markets like India catch up with safety standards in developed countries.Acquiring Takata also would allow Khan to diversify Flex-N-Gates business of supplying front-end modules and plastic parts and into higher-margin segments dominated by a few suppliers.Despite its troubles, Takata has technology, long-standing relationships with clients and plays in a field with very few competitors, said Deepesh Rathore, director at Emerging Markets Automotive Advisors in London. For Flex-N-Gate, this is a good opportunity to diversify into a new component segment. Bloomberg",2016-09-29,a92kAmGXZSkm9Q7FmphFXI,"Shahid Khan, the NFL team owner who made his fortune selling car bumpers, is in the race to rescue embattled Japanese airbag manufacturer Takata

				On a quarterly basis, the net income rose by 2.8%.The companys revenue in Q3 FY17 stood at Rs 11,814 crorea jump of 14.2% on year-on-year basis and 2.6% rise on quarter-on-quarter basis, as against Rs10,341 crore in the same quarter of 2015-16.We continue our robust financial performance with a revenue growth of 3% QoQ and 13.8% YoY in constant currency terms. The richness in our offerings coupled with our Mode 1-2-3 growth strategy is helping us gain a higher share of our clients wallet reflected in the increasing revenue contribution from our Top 5, Top 10 and Top 20 customers. Our revenues from fixed price /managed services contracts increased from 61.3% to 63.2% this quarter further strengthening our success in outcome based business model, said C.

HCL Tech translated its revenue guidance for the current fiscal to 10-12%% in US dollar terms based on December 31 , 2016, exchange rates, as against the earlier guidance at 12-14%. We expect our FY17 revenues to be in the middle of this range, according to the company. The acquisitions and IP-led partnerships announced after 30 September, 2016, are likely to additionally contribute 0.6% to 1.0% in revenues depending upon the date of consummation of the geometric deal.The company also  reported that nine transformational deals were signed this quarter, across service lines, industry verticals and geographies. Anshoo Nandwaani,  vice-president & principal analyst, Greyhound Research said, The appointment of C. Vijayakumar in the last quarter is proving to be a good move for HCL Tech. HCL is going through a change and he is bringing in fresh perspectives in the way their deals are being constructed.There are clear efforts to modernize existing traditional infrastructure contracts (the ones with lower margins) and increase the use of digital technologies.While the company has managed to come out in good stead this quarter, sustaining this growth momentum, particularly amidst the realms of uncertainty in key markets like the US and the UK, will require both back-breaking work and innovative approaches towards IP development, automation and local/remote delivery to ensure non-linear growth, Nandwaani added.The Noida-based company also reported broad-based growth across all revenue segments with the Americas and Europe growing by 15% and 10.56%, respectively, year-on-year.At present, across all Indian IT Services providers, the digital revenues for IT services broadly range between 10 to 15%. Although HCLs current digital revenues are smallish, compared to other Indian IT Services providers HCLs thrust on Internet of Things (IoT) is impressive and significant. Further, at a time when IoT is growing in a big way, having expertise in embedded systems is an added strength for HCL Tech, said Nandwaani.However, experts warn that with a growing protectionist sentiment globally, Indian IT service providers, including HCL Technologies, face a bumpy road ahead.",2017-01-24,aFi62sw4b6L1uzcAviRIoL,"HCL Technologies consolidated net profit rises 7.8% to Rs2,070 crore for the third quarter ended 31 December 2016, as compared to Rs1,920 crore reported in the year-ago period",10:14,"HCL Q3 profit rises 7.8% to Rs2,070 crore"
0.11,"Price discounts on online platforms and frequent sales drives are unsettling Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail Ltds (AB Fashion) premium brands business and driving a strategy rethink.
				   
				Sales at Madura Fashion and Lifestyle, which has premium brands, fell 3% in April-June, the second consecutive quarterly drop. As the company refrained from deep discounting to protect brand value, throughput volumes fell, impacting the units operating profit.Sales at Pantaloons, which operates in the value segment, grew 31%, helping the company register a respectable revenue growth of 8%. With the division seeing good traction, analysts expect it to continue to drive growth at AB Fashion and Retail.But it will be lopsided growthnot least because Madura is more profitable than Pantaloons.A significant part of AB Fashion and Retails capital is invested in Madura (roughly half of stand-alone assets are in Madura). The division generates more than half of AB Fashions revenues and weak performance is weighing on the overall performance.The company is recalibrating the Madura business.It is reducing fixed costs, increasing the season cycles and is driving digital transformation through the omni channel programme (shoppers can check unavailable inventory at stores and order online).The measures and inventory drawdown process are estimated to take another quarter to begin showing results, which means Q2 could also be weak.Aided by the wedding and festive season, the company expects Maduras performance to recover from October or in the second half of the fiscal year. But the street is sceptical. The stock fell sharply after the Q1 results and is yet to recover.That is due to weak pricing power. Discounts have become sales drivers. Online platforms continue to offer high discounts and retail stores are being forced to follow suit. Further, with the consolidation in e-commerce firms (such as the Myntra-Jabong combination), analysts fear the market will continue to see pricing pressures.To be sure, the problem is not typical to AB Fashion.The whole apparel and retail industry is facing pressure on prices and realizations.It looks like now that it is a new normal that there will be discounting, there will be schemes and you have to live with those and then really still ensure that you can make money out of it, Shoppers Stop Ltd told analysts last month.But companies are getting around this. Branded apparel divisions of both Arvind Ltd and Raymond Ltd registered good sales growth in the June quarter. It is a different matter that these companies are yet to attain decent profitability.But AB Fashions Madura is yet to even reach this stage.

0.21,"Earnings of refiners for the September quarter are likely to decline compared to the June quarter. Indian refining firms had benefited from substantial inventory gains in the June quarter, but that advantage will not be available for the September quarter, as there may not be a major inventory impact considering oil prices have not moved dramatically.
				   
				Whats more, refining margins have inched up only a bit. Benchmark Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) last quarter came in at $5.1 a barrel against $5 a barrel in the June quarter. In short, even though refining margins have risen a bit, lack of substantial inventory gains will mean that reported GRMs of Indian refining firms are likely to be sequentially lower.State-run refining and marketing companiesBharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd are no exception to that trend. On an overall basis, subdued refining performance will more than offset the benefit of robust market margins (calculated diesel retail margins up 32% QoQ) and healthy marketing volumes, wrote Edelweiss Securities Ltd analysts in their September quarter preview. Five brokerage firms previews studied by Mint show  that Ebitda of all three companies is expected to fall against the June quarter. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. But investors are sitting on good gains so far this year. In general, improving profitability, robust product demand and lower crude oil price environment have helped sentiment for these stocks.On the other hand, earnings of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) are expected to be reasonably resilient, Arya Sen and Ranjeet Jaiswal of Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd wrote in a report on 10 October. The brokerage firm estimates RILs stand-alone net profit to increase by 11% year-on-year and only 4% quarter-on-quarter decline, helped by strong refinery throughput and higher petrochemical earnings. Its GRM is expected to be close to $10 a barrel compared to $11.5 a barrel in the June quarter. Updates on its expansion projects and telecom business will be crucial for the stock. The RIL stock has gone up about 8% from its recent low on 2 September following the announcement of the forthcoming commercial launch of services by its telecom unit, at its annual general meeting.Meanwhile, the story continues to be grim for oil producersOil and Natural Gas Corp.

What you have just done is leveraging mobile, next-generation security, Internet of Things (IoT), cognitive computing, natural interfaces and analytics technologies to perform a simple but critical management intervention which ensured the smooth running of your business. Welcome to your new world, Ms CEO. A tsunami of new technologies has hit the business ecosystem. The first ripples were felt in the middle of the last decade and were evidenced by the likes of Salesforce.com and that upstart called Amazon Web Services, Inc. What a curious idea it was for an e-commerce company to expose, and rent out, its underlying infrastructure to third parties! IDC predicts a third of all industry leaders will be replaced by 2020. Thats how profound the disruption is. On the consumer side, the waves intensified towards the end of the decade as social media took centre stage and e-commerce boomed in every single major economy in the world. As I write this, Facebook has nearly 1.8 billion users and Alibaba has sold $18 billion worth of products in a single day. Consumer services companies, vividly exemplifying the sharing economy, have become household brands: today, more millennials possibly identify with Uber and Airbnb than they do with venerable corporations such as Johnson & Johnson, and GE. The force of the sharing economy is reshaping vast tracts of the consumer ecosystem, effecting the closure of retail giants such as Circuit City and Woolworths, and acquisitions such as that of Starwood Hotels by Marriott.The waves are swamping those without the lifeboat of digital capabilities.The first intense wave of change came with technologies which created what IDC calls the third platform of computing. The four pillars of the third platform, namely social, mobile, analytics and cloud (SMAC), today aggregate to a market exceeding $0.5 trillion. According to IDC research, its still expected to grow in excess of 13% in 2016, taking more than 35% of overall technology spending. It accounts for 110% of the industrys growth: traditional IT spending, while still two thirds of overall spend, is shrinking at greater than 5% a year. The third platform of computing is a profound shift in the computing paradigm. Users have moved from millions to billions, devices from tens to hundreds of millions and theres enough data generated on Planet Earth to fill up the memory of a stack of Apple iPads all the way to the moon and back. SMAC technologies have transformed IT fundamentally, and opened up entirely new opportunities for businesses. From smart products to analytics businesses and from real-time system enabled mobile field forces to digital supply chains, businesses across the spectrum have embraced these in different ways to drive economic value. The maturing of the third platform of computing has enabled entirely new technologies, and combinations, to develop and mature. IDC collectively calls them the innovation accelerators, as our research identifies their potential to drive not just technology and process but also complete business disruption. Of these technologies, the following five are likely to take centre stage in India in 2017. Watch out for them.Next gen securityIf youre like me and have a continuous wrestling match with your store of forgotten capital letter-alphanumericchange-them-every-two-weeks passwords, then I can give you some comfort. The era of the complicated password will soon pass. Next generation security systems are integrating biometrics (fingerprint, voice, iris recognition) with behavioural analytics (usage location, onsite/on-app behaviour, transaction patterns) to help make bank accounts, health records, government databases and countless other stores of sensitive information ever more secure. Though not visible to most, the security of the networks our data whizzes around on, and of the data centres which power up the modern economy, is also undergoing radical modernization. For example, network security is not just about appliances detecting bad actors anymore: its moving to a managed services model where the network is monitored for bad actors, real-time responses become a reality and damage control processes kick in instantly in the event of a hack. From Apples fingerprint readers to behavioural security platforms being introduced by the likes of Intel Security and Cisco, the industry is racing to help us realize the possibilities these technologies unlock. Expect a new paradigm in security to make life easier, and more secure, for you in 2017 and beyond. Cognitive systemsThe notion of intelligent machines has fascinated man for decades. It has been the subject of Hollywood movies, science fiction books and doomsday theories. Well, theyve arrived but not in the way you thought. I must stress that intelligent machines of the current generation do not have native intelligence as humans do. They are getting smarter on the back of their ability to process vast quantities of data really fast, and identify patterns and trends to be used. Who knows what the next generation of machines brings, though?A common example is the May I help you? assistants, which have appeared on e-commerce websites. Increasingly, you are not interacting with a human but a piece of software if you do ask a question. It has been programmed with learning algorithms, and fed masses of product catalogue and user behaviour data to be able to help you. Intelligent machines are also parsing through all the published legal cases and court decisions in recorded history to help lawyers serve their clients better; and doing exactly the same with doctors trying to figure out what might be wrong with a sick patient. IBMs Watson platform is perhaps the best known in this space, but its not the only one. Google has a different approach with the TensorFlow and Google Cloud Machine Learning combination. The analytics platforms from the likes of SAS are evolving too, as are new-age data storage systems from NetApp, HP Enterprise and their peers. The year 2017 will see consumer services firms in different sectors adopting cognitive technologies more aggressively. Expect the likes of banks, e-commerce companies, telecom service providers and hospitals to deploy them faster than others. From a wider perspective, the full story will unfold in 2018-19. Internet of Things (IoT)The Internet today has enabled interactions and engagement in society in ways which were not imagined even a decade ago. Video calling through the phone at practically zero marginal cost, cloud computing which allows organizations to think at global scale without the need for massive technology investments and a plethora of consumer services at your doorstep are just three manifestations of the amazing power of the Internet.The next wave is now upon us: machines are now interacting with each other and triggering processes without human intervention. In the process, mountains of data are being generated daily, enabling machine learning and cognitive computing. This is IoT. The 2016 IDC IoT survey in India, which covered 470 companies, reveals a great enthusiasm for IoT already. Process manufacturing companies as well as logistics services and trucking firms are leading the way. The Industrial Internet is born. The year 2017 is likely to see the inflection point of IoT adoption in India. Billions of sensors will help monitor oil pipelines remotely, control home air-conditioning systems and track trucks and pallets as they move through our vast countryside. Its potential is staggering, its promise mouth-watering. It can generate crores of rupees worth of efficiencies and productivity gains in the corporate sector; for consumers, it could mean being able to switch on your air conditioner before you reach home; or your coffee machine grinding the beans when the sensors in your bedroom note that youve up.  3D printingAt a recent conference, Anand Mahindra, chairman of the Mahindra Group, shared that they had put a 3D printer in a school as part of corporate social responsibility and R&D initiatives. The group was keen to see what innovation the children might come up with if they are given the right tools. The results are awaited but early signs are promising. The term 3D printing, in some ways, is a misnomer. They are actually capital goods equipment which operate visually like printers do. In the future, this technology is likely to radically remake manufacturing. Supply chains will be disrupted and the manufacturing process for many products will be democratized, with the possibility of garage-based production and retail store production already being realized. Nikes Fly Knit shoes are made in-shop after your foot is scanned and the images sent to the 3D printer. Skin grafts have been synthesized in labs; auto parts are being 3D printed. In 2017, we will see the gradual influx of these machines into manufacturing firms, research labs and the possible odd hospital. It will take some time and price cuts before 3D printers go mainstream. But it holds much promise and would be especially useful for far-flung areas of the nation. Natural user interfacesWhat I wouldnt give to not have to get up for the remote control, and simply change the channel on the television with a swipe of my hand, or through a conveniently placed gadget that would recognize my voice and change the channel! Thats Natural User Interface (NUI) for you and its here to stay. But really, while that TV remote is still important, a lot of what we experience is now being redefined by new forms of cognitive controls. The shift from text to graphics was a major leap, courtesy of Xerox Corpo ration, and popularised by Apple with their hallmark Macintosh OS in 1984. More recently, weve witnessed a revolution of sorts in the UI space: touch (smartphones), voice (Siri) and even gesture (Microsoft Kinect, Nintendo Wii).Today consumers want amplified, immersive and authentic experiences from what they consume; NUI enables just that. The human-machine interface is fast changing our experiences, thus heralding an era of multi-touch surfaces, powerful and lightweight mobile devices and now the emerging market of wearable technology. We are entering a fascinating world sans constraints physical and virtual.On the enterprise side, firms today are increasing the connect with their ecosystem of customers, employees, suppliers and partners, moving away from mere CX (customer experience) to authentic experiences. At IDC, were seeing this extensively in media and gaming; it is a matter of time before NUI permeates retail, healthcare, fashion and automobile verticals. It is my considered view that when the neural capabilities of touch, voice and gesture and the capable hardware thats available to process these inputs (at consumer prices to boot) are coupled with the large scale APIs to leverage these NUI opportunities, a new age of platforms which can redesign and revolutionize your experience will dawn. 2017 shall be a year when the increasing clamour for experience by consumers and the omni-experience transformation needs of enterprises shall see a scaling up of investments towards this aim. As this technology transformation evolves, so too will its impact on consumer experience and the digital business ecosystem.In sum, 2017 will see the next technological revolution reshaping Indian society, business and the government landscape. Recent events have already triggered the digitalization of the payments ecosystem at warp speed. The five technologies described above, individually and in combination, will herald the dawn of the next technological age.Jaideep Mehta is managing director, IDC India and South Asia.Five trends that can change the tech world by 2021Internet-of-things (IoT) software and solutions: IoT will be driving new levels of customer insight and engagement for some by 2021, but technology diversity and the need for organizational changes will still stymie or delay many firms. Intelligent agents: Intelligent agents and related robots will have eliminated a net 6% of jobs by 2021. Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR): By 2021, AR will be commonplace, while VR will remain niche.

0.5,"A revolution is brewing in the financial ecosystem that will extend the benefits of formal financial services to the masses. Global trends suggest that the banking and financial services sector are undergoing the change that the telecom sector witnessed a few years ago. A number of OTT (over-the-top) players came up with innovative solutions to provide a comprehensive communication experience. They leveraged the infrastructure created by telecom service providers and provided value-added services to consumers. Similar innovation is happening in payments and other financial services.
				   
				Traditionally, the banking system has had a stringent regulatory environment. This is beginning to change as regulators take cognizance of the innovation in the area. Companies providing value-added services over and above bank accounts for customers are getting good traction. These companies are coming up with constantly improving technology, data analytics and lean processes to provide high-quality services at an economical cost. Financial services can be divided broadly into two segments. The first category consists of frequently used services like payments, cash in, cash out, etc. These services will witness innovation in the area of customer experience. For example, payment being made through a QR (quick response) code-based solution enhances the experience of making a payment and has the potential of reducing a consumers reliance on cash. The second category consists of long-haul services like lending, insurance and cash management. This category will witness innovation that can extend the reach of these services to the masses. A company giving a personal loan based on utility-bill payment history or extending a working capital loan to a merchant based on its digital transaction history comes in this category. Companies are banking on their ability to provide such services to a hitherto untouched market. In India, the pace of this change is even more rapid due to the favourable combination of a government policy environment, a progressive banking regulator and the emergence of innovative fintech companies. The percolation of financial services to every citizen will happen the way it did with telecom services. The pace will only accelerate. Aadhaar is going to play an important role in this change. Innovation and regulation balance out each other and grow together. Innovation solves restrictions and regulation sets boundaries to safeguard consumers. When both innovation and the regulatory environment move in sync, the service delivery goes to the next level. The emergence of wallets, payment banks and small finance banks is the result of such synchronous movement of innovation and regulation.A large segment of the population will enjoy the benefits of formal financial services for the first time. The first step in this direction has already been taken with Jan Dhan accounts. Digital payments through various instruments like wallets, UPI (unified payment interface), cards, etc, are growing consistently. The last few months have demonstrated that consumers are willing to become digitally savvy if the right solutions are provided. A critical mass of consumers and merchants is getting comfortable with digital payments and apprehensions have reduced significantly in a short span. This is leading to a network effect and unprecedented growth in the digital ecosystem.Digital payments are leading to access to credit through formal channels for consumers and merchants who were unable to get this benefit till now. There is similar innovation in the areas of insurance and wealth management, where the focus is on increasing penetration of these services. For, services like wealth management have remained limited to a select segment. Technology companies are developing ways to provide such services to consumers irrespective of the quantum of their wealth. This is being made possible through technology innovation that renders the incremental cost of acquiring and servicing a customer negligible. Effectively, the reach of financial services and consumer experience is going to improve drastically in the country.Vijay Shekhar Sharma is the founder of PaytmThis is part of a series of articles in Mints 10th anniversary special issue that look at India 10 years from now.

0.25,"Reliance Industries Ltds (RILs) March quarter results were better than estimates, but only just. Its stand-alone Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) last quarter stood at Rs.10,727 crore, or about 3% higher than consensus estimates. According to a Bloomberg poll of analysts, Ebitda was estimated at Rs.10,394 crore.
				   
				In fact, some brokerage firms such as Kotak Institutional Equities had estimated Ebitda of over Rs.10,700 crore, on the back of strong margins in the petrochemicals segment. As it turns out, margins in the petrochemicals business were strong at 14%, far higher than 10.6% for the March quarter last year. Petrochemicals Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margins were higher due to strong product deltas (rate of change in prices compared with the change in unit costs) and low absolute product prices. Petrochemicals Ebit increased 29% due to strength in polymer deltas, robust polymer demand and higher volumes in the polyester chain.Besides, RILs gross refining margin (GRM) at $10.8 a barrel was marginally higher than many analysts estimates. For instance, Morgan Stanley Research and BNP Paribas Securities (Asia) Ltd were expecting GRM of $10.6 per barrel and $10.5 a barrel, respectively. While the companys GRM has declined on a sequential basis, this was expected, considering that benchmark Singapore GRM had also declined compared with the December quarter. Whats more, the company has managed to maintain its premium over Singapore GRMs at $3.5 a barrel, as in the December quarter. Strong gasoline and naphtha cracks, robust demand growth and favourable crude markets helped boost refining margins, the company said. Higher utilization rates also helped.On a consolidated basis, while RILs organized retail business has seen a smart 26% year-on-year Ebit growth, this was offset by a sharp drop in the oil and gas segment Ebit (97% year-on-year decline). The stand-alone oil and gas business reported losses at the Ebit level due to lower realization for liquids and a decline in production, while a drop in prices affected the companys US shale operations.As pointed out earlier, the results were largely on expected lines and dont do much to move the needle as far as the stocks valuations go. Currently, one RIL share trades at 11 times its estimated earnings for this fiscal year. In the near-term though, the fact that refining margin has declined may cloud sentiments for the stock. So far, quarter-to-date, Singapore GRM has averaged at $5.2 a barrel, according to an analyst, compared with $7.7 in the March quarter. Of course, it would help if petrochemical margins remain steady.However, over the medium term, the outlook for the stock may turn positive as investors start looking at higher earnings on account of RILs expansion plans. As Amit Shah of BNP Paribas writes in a recent report, the benefit of expansion of petchem capacities, pet-coke and refinery off-gas cracker projects would be visible from FY18 onwards.But on the other hand, the prospects of the telecom business remain an uncertainty. BNP, for instance, has not assigned any value to RILs telecom business in its sum-of-parts valuation.

0.81,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. reported revenues of $3.19 billion for the September quarter, marginally higher than the Streets estimate of $3.16 billion. On a sequential basis, revenues grew by 3.3%, which again doesnt look impressive for the traditionally strong September quarter. After the June quarters impressive 6% sequential growth, investors are evidently feeling let down.
				   
				But these quibbles aside, Cognizants results reiterate the fact that the company has been miles ahead of the competition this year. On a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, its revenues grew by 16.5%, after adjusting for incremental revenues from the TriZetto Corp. acquisition. In comparison, industry leader Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) grew revenues by just 5.8% y-o-y. Infosys Ltd grew revenues by 7.6% and Wipro Ltds growth stood at just 3.4%.Just a year ago, TCSs growth was higher by about 300 basis points, when it was growing at a healthy pace of almost 15%. But while its growth has slipped sharply in the past four quarters, Cognizant has done just the opposite. The latters growth rate is now almost 11 percentage points higher, an unusually high differential in an industry that is so competitive. One basis point is 0.01%.Also note that Cognizant has raised its revenue growth guidance for 2015 each quarter, for the past three quarters, while analysts have been cutting growth estimates for most Indian tech leaders. Cognizant has benefited from not having any material exposure to troubled sectors such as energy and telecom. But thats not the only reason for its outperformance. There has also been a shift in the nature of IT spending in the past year, and Cognizant, with its higher exposure to discretionary services such as consulting (58% of revenues last quarter), has gained. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a recent note to clients, Companies with inherent strength in run-the-business services are struggling to sustain momentum, while those with greater exposure to discretionary spending are gaining. Last quarter, the so-called run-the-business part of Cognizants portfolio grew by 1.5% sequentially, while growth in segments that depend on discretionary spending stood three times higher at 4.6%.As pointed out earlier in this column, Cognizant appears to have made disproportionate gains in the trend towards increasing spend on digital services. According to analysts, the companys early investments in this segment, including acquisitions it has made in the space, coupled with its consulting expertise, has helped it gain a higher share of this relatively new revenue stream.Its not that others havent had any success. TCS said after its September quarter results that revenues from digital services grew by 10% sequentially last quarter. Be that as it may, overall revenue growth numbers suggest that Cognizant has gained considerable market share this year, at the expense of large India-based IT companies. Last quarter, its incremental revenues of $426 million (on a y-o-y basis) were nearly double that of TCSs ($227 million), and higher than the cumulative incremental revenues of TCS and Infosys.This clear divergence is also reflected in the way these stocks have moved in the past yearCognizants shares have risen by over 35%, while those of TCS have fallen by 3%.",2015-11-04,beBSWzL5LdrIGeZM5tmu3H,"Cognizants results reiterate the fact that the company has been miles ahead of competition this year

0.2,"The inordinate delay in Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds commercial launch is giving incumbents time in preparing for the coming onslaught. They first incentivized data consumption by cutting rates only for non-peak hours with so-called night plans. This week, Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd increased data benefits on some of their pre-paid data recharge packs. Vodafone India Ltd hasnt bothered to respond yet. 
				   
				These arent signs of an industry desperately adjusting to the reality of a new large entrant; instead, the moves by incumbents suggest a carefully calibrated strategy that is aimed at ultimately blunting the price advantage of Reliance Jio. Consider the latest changes in pricing. Most headlines screamed Bharti, Idea cut data tariffs by 67%; but this is far from the truth. To start with, these companies havent cut tariffs by 67%; they have increased data benefits by 67%. And that too, only in some packs. Its important to note that the majority of data subscribers use plans ranging from 500MB to 1.5GB, with the flagship plan being the 1GB plan. The latest changes in tariffs havent touched this plan at all. In other words, incumbents arent yet ready to sacrifice revenues and margins with their flagship plans. Idea Cellular has inched towards making its data services more affordable in this segmentits 2GB plan now comes at the cost of the earlier 1.5GB plan. But clearly, theres no hurry to cut prices meaningfully in the most popular plans and drive volume growth. Also Read: Reliance Jio to go for Rs15,000 crore rights issue

This column has pointed out earlier that growth in data volumes has dropped sharply in recent quarters. For the top three telcos, incremental data volumes fell to 14,680 terabytes in the March quarter, compared with an average of 31,230 terabytes in the preceding four quarters. In this backdrop, its imperative that incumbents cut tariffs meaningfully to attract new customers and drive consumption. But it now looks like these significant changes in pricing will happen only after Reliance Jio launches. Evidently, incumbents dont want to play all their cards upfront.For now, they are teasing subscribers to increase data consumption by reducing the price of larger packs (exceeding 2GB). Considering that these companies are running under-utilised networks, these incentives dont entail additional costs. As such, revenues and margins are pretty much protected.But what this effective reduction in prices for larger packs does is that it further blunts the price advantage that Reliance Jio can offer when it eventually launches operations. Of course, theres no limit to how low Reliance Jio can go with prices to win market share. Even so, with the every successive calibration in data tariffs, incumbents have managed to reduce the extent to which Reliance Jio can disrupt the market.",2016-07-21,beknhdWUSzBNA8rY1yyXGJ,"Moves of Incumbents suggest a carefully calibrated strategy that is aimed at ultimately blunting the price advantage of Reliance Jio

1.0,"Computing devices and smart gadgets are set to evolve further with sleeker designs, better security and innovative features in 2017. Heres a glimpse of how some technology companies are going about the task and trends like big data and security are aiding this evolution.
				   
				What next for Apples productivity push?Having mended bridges with the likes of International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and Microsoft, and forged partnerships with the likes of Cisco and Deloitte, Apple is in the midst of making its most aggressive push into the enterprise ecosystem. These partnerships take care of the software side of things, but the conundrum remains with the hardware. There is a definite potential of cannibalization within the computing device line-up, with the MacBook Airs, iPad Pros and MacBook Pros fighting for a common demographic, for the most part. Apple will also have to contend with some amount of criticism in 2017, with the underwhelming upgrades to the MacBook Pro line-upthis at a time when Microsoft flexed its muscles with the Surface Studio. Nevertheless, the iPhone remains as solid as ever for enterprise users.Microsofts Surface gambit: Revive the PC market?At a time when personal computer, or PC, shipments have been steadily declining, Microsoft seems to have taken it upon itself to set the benchmark in the ecosystem. And in the process, also show off what it is capable of. The Surface Studio all-in-one (AIO) with the Pixel Dial joins the Surface Pro and Surface Book portable Windows convertibles, and is indeed revolutionary. The 28-inch PixelSense display is believed to be the slimmest of its kind, and has 63% more pixels than a 4K TV. With prices starting $2,999 (Rs2,00,000 approximately), it isnt going to fly off the shelves. Though arguably, the first time ever, Microsoft has started to beat Apple at the innovation and design games, but just how they follow it up in 2017 will matter a lot. Flexing of the muscles aside, the real utility will now need to stand outand that holds true for the entire laptop and convertible market.Big data: Itll be biggerWhile there is considerable focus on smart cities, public transport and smarter infrastructure, there remains an ever-increasing need for data to make these systems work. For example, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Ford Motor Co. are collecting the cellphone location data of as many as two million Boston city residents; the idea is to create near-instant urban mobility patterns which would otherwise have taken years to collect, decipher and work on. Big data will be ever so critical for corporations, governments and also for research, and this is what will drive productivity, innovation and collaboration.Googles Pixel hardware game: A new inningsWith the Pixel phones, there has been a constant emphasis on the Made by Google aspect. It is clear that the software and services major wants to get into the hardware game, on its own terms. And so it has, wielding greater control over the successors to the Nexus smartphones. Finally, Android as a platform is shining throughunhindered, unwrapped and uncluttered. Pixel has shown just how good Android can be, but Google needs to fix bigger problemsthe world is still buying Android phones made by the likes of Samsung, Motorola and a whole bunch of Chinese brands, and they have no control over thatcustomization, lack of software updates and more. Do we see an even bigger Pixel smartphone line-up, covering more affordable price points?Security: Artificial Intelligence (AI) to prevent cyber-attacks?In todays world, cybersecurity is managed by a combination of humans and machines, with the latter usually configured by the former, and there remains genuine room for error. This is where the researchers from the MIT, perhaps, have a solution for the futurea new system called AI2. It uses machine learning to flag potential security threats and attacks. The human element remains, but the new system can actually scan and flag a lot more data than any human can.Dells ultimate ultrabook becomes flexibleThe Dell XPS 13 is perhaps the best ultrabook in the Windows laptop ecosystem.

0.67,"The next big challenge for Indian law firms will be how to make the best use of technology and how to motivate their human resources, Cyril Shroff, managing partner of Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, said in an interview as he looks back at the history of a firm that is 100 years old. Indias largest law firm, Amarchand and Mangaldas and Suresh A. Shroff  and Co.s Delhi and Mumbai regions, managed by brothers Shardul and Cyril Shroff, respectively, agreed to split into two firms in 2015.  Edited excerpts:
Amarchand Mangaldas has completed 100 years. How has it progressed institutionally and what is the way forward?It is an inflexion point in our journey. It gives us the moral authority and stature, as an organization, to reflect on the past and chart the future. It has been a truly rich and long history that started around 100 years ago. Along the way it has morphed a number of times during the journey to adjust to the changing times. If we just look back at the eras the firm has lived through starting from the great depression, the world war, Indias freedom struggle, independence, writing of the Constitution, formation of the Supreme Court, Nehrus economic policy, so many different prime ministers, so many changes in capital markets and corporate law, the firm has so much experience behind it. If you have stayed around for so long and stayed relevant there is something right you are doing and it is all due to our core values.You need to be nimble and open to change; for instance, none of the people are the same, none of the clients are the same. We have always changed any adversity into opportunity. So in a sense for us it has been series of new beginnings. Accepting changes is the DNA of Amarchand. Anyone who is not nimble enough to accept changes wont survive and that is true for every business, not just law firms.The legal sphere has changed in every era, particularly in the past 20-25 years. This is an era where the idea of a modern law firm really took birth. And it was the Amarchand legacy which invented modern firmsmodern structure, campus recruitment, smart offices. Where do you think the next wave of changes will come for Indian law firms?Technology will be a big part of the change. Even today we are about 625 lawyers. Such a workforce requires a lot of management in terms of your resources, technology deployment and outreach to clients. The next big challenge would be how to make best use of technology and how to motivate human resources.In terms of the digital age and technology firms,  enforcement of contracts and (intellectual property) rights is a virgin area. A lot of conversation is on privacy and rights. Part of our business plan is to look at the most relevant new industries and almost all of them are based in technology. This is a new practice area and may become huge in coming years. For instance, the issue is around taxation, competition law, human rightsthese are the issues for these new-age businesses. It is fascinating. We are on the verge of a fourth industrial revolution and the old-world offerings and laws are a mismatch with new challenges and opportunities presenting themselves in this digital system.Our clients are changing all the time due to the churn in the corporate sector and so are the practice areas. For instance, the new bankruptcy codewe are tailoring our practice accordingly. What is needed is a pragmatic interpretation of the business scenario and adaptation to achieve policy goals. Overhauling of old regulations is too disruptive.Like Indian companies, Indian law firms are largely family operated. Do you see some changes happening there?This is a historical fact; better to say that there are founders who are still in control of firms. But, equally they have come a long way in sharing power. Its the pace of change that is a little uncertain. It would be incorrect to say that they are only founder-owned. Firms have a strong founder influence but they also have a lot of professionals who have a say in running the firm, including ours.What are your views on entry of foreign firms? Will it lead to consolidation?I think entry of foreign firms should be allowed as soon as possible so long it is done properly by keeping all stakeholders on board. This has been a lingering idea for so long and keeping this in a limbo for so long is not a good idea. At some stage it has to happen. It will enable the market to move to the next level in terms of sophistication, economics because currently fee levels are in a free fall; there is hyper competition, fees are going down, costs are going up, particularly for talent. There is need for a trigger to resolve the current situation and I think entry of foreign firms is going to be that trigger. Indian firms merging with foreign firms may not happen. India has not seen too many law firm mergers. There may be team acquisitions but big firm mergers may not happen.Recent corporate battles such as the Tata-Mistry spat have raised concerns about family control, corporate governance. What are your larger views on these issues?I do not comment on specific cases. But more generally, if we look at the corporate governance scenario and debate in India, we are dealing with a version 2.0. There is far more awareness about conflicts, what are the roles of different stakeholdersminority shareholders, independent directors, responsibility of promoters, institutional investors, proxy advisers. Everyone is taking their roles much more seriously and we have moved by leaps and bounds. Our firm has a separate division that is a corporate governance advisory, which is advising companies on governance issues. Most of the companies are facing issues such as managing conflicts such as related party transactions, succession, role of founders and promoters. India is the only country which has a concept of promoters. What is a promoteris it just a label, liability, does it give you extra power, all of this is being discovered on a case-by-case basis.There is this whole issue of promoters getting extra information that other investors dont. How does one resolve this?Promoters carry a lot of burden. Because they carry extra burden and are in control of the company, I see a rationale in them getting privileged information. What is ambiguous is that what is the boundary surrounding thatso that is evolving. The foundation of higher governance standards was laid with the Companies Act, 2013, and then Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India) amending the listing and disclosure requirements. But nothing happens with just regulations now, the laws are being tested with real-life examples.There is no regulator for law firms, does the Bar Council need changes? India has always operated under the idea that practising law is a privilege and this is a noble profession. So there are, for instance, restrictions on advertising. Unfortunately, globally practising law has become a business. Overseas regulations have evolved in terms of how you regulate a service and a businessprovider of the service and consumer of the service. We are still dealing with the first concept and that is the reason for the disconnect. There is a lack of understanding on business model; the law profession, it has now morphed itself into a business and a service. We still believe it to be a noble profession but we are also a business, we have a profit and loss account, we have to pay salaries. That is why the regulations have not kept pace with changing dynamics.But the flip side is that laws keep on changing and even flip-flopping.No matter how clearly the law is drafted, it will always need to be amended to suit newer dynamics. Its hard to cope with changes but actually we are happy that law is not static and it is evolving. Sebi does a good job of it and considers all the views, and that is the reason why the regulations come out looking much better.What is your view on Indian tax policies? We have acquired a bad name due to flip-flops on the issue. I wont deny the fact that India has a bad reputation in terms of stability in tax regime for a variety of reasons. But if you look at the direction and the political intent being displayed by the government, it is towards political stability. It is intended to create ease of business. If you compare it with the period two-three years back, it has got a lot better. What I worry about the current economic thinking is that it has started moving or slanting towards the left. What started off as a more right-oriented policy has now shifted to the left. One of the things that I see happening is inheritance tax. This may happen in the current regime. It comes from the mindset that 1% of the population is controlling 60% of Indias wealth. The broader theme is to move to a more stable tax regime. There are some aberrations such as the recent circular on FPIs (foreign portfolio investors). But the broader picture is to create a stable environment. I believe the government on that.What are your observations on the merger and acquisition (M&A) climate in India?I think the merger and acquisition climate is decent just now but a lot of underpinning of the market on the sell side is stressed asset pressure and for buy side or foreign investors, India continues to be a bright spot and an opportunity. Barring a few, most deals are local. In terms of deal execution, Indian acquirers are more flexible and can take much more risks than global acquirers. Global players take time in due diligence and paper work. And due to so much pressure of stressed assets, the sellers do not have patience to wait for global buyers or investors.Deals being closed in the stressed asset area are quite small, right?My take on this is that in the next couple of years, these stressed asset deals would be concluded bilaterally and not under bankruptcy code. Lets take the Jaypee, UltraTech, Rosneft deal, for example. The motivation was to sell stressed assets but it was completely done bilaterally and in a complete conventional M&A fashion. If it had to take place under, say, a bankruptcy code or a CDR (corporate debt restructuring) case, then it would not have ever happened. So from the sell side it is going to be a resolution of stressed asset situation and implementation would be bilateral. I think this trend is going to continue, till such time the new bankruptcy code and things surrounding it are completely settled. Assets that have lost all value would go down effectively as a garage sale through the bankruptcy code and assets with some good equity would continue to be sold bilaterally.",2017-01-27,cMTnz9x0Vfe9UIjOlFGGUK,"The managing partner of Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas on the next big challenge for law firms, the emergence of issues such as enforcement of contracts in a digital age and privacy rights",23:54,Accepting changes is the DNA of Amarchand: Cyril Shroff

A combination of premium content/properties during the quarter and overall viewership share increases helped the companys ad revenue growth beat expectations. The launch of Hindi general entertainment channel &tv did help advertising growth in FY16, says Mihir Modi, chief finance and strategy officer at Zee Entertainment.
				   
				On the other hand, subscription revenue, accounting for 39% of total revenue, increased at a relatively slower pace of 16.4%. Zee Entertainment derived its remaining revenue from other sales and services, the share of which dropped to about 5% compared with 12.4% in past years quarter. Overall revenue increased by about 14% to Rs.1,532 crore. Still, a decline in advertising and publicity expenses, and other expenses boosted operating profit performance.Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) increased as much as 53% year-on-year to Rs.414 crore.  Kotak Institutional Equities and Edelweiss Securities were expecting an Ebitda of Rs.372.7 crore and Rs.366.8 crore, respectively. Nevertheless, a higher tax outgo and rising depreciation costs together with a decline in other income meant net profit growth was much slower at 13% to Rs.260 crore.What next? What will really be worth watching is whether ad revenue growth performance is sustainable in fiscal year 2017. That should influence the stock, which has outperformed the benchmark Sensex in the past one year. Zee Entertainment expects industry advertising revenue to grow by 15-16% this year, a rate similar to last year. While it is true that the likes of Patanjali are adding to advertising momentum from FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) sector, some others in the FMCG space have slowed down; so, we expect stable performance from FMCG sector this year, says Modi. Also, its worth noting that advertising momentum from e-commerce firms is likely to soften, which would be compensated by better performance from auto and telecom sectors, he adds.Nevertheless, valuations seem to be capturing much of the optimism.

1.0,"Mohamed Ismail Jamal, 41, got the idea for watscooking.com, while eating biryani with his family, to give the large number of homesick, immigrant professionals of Bengaluru a taste of home. With more than 5,000 registered home chefs across over 100 cities on his portal, Jamal explains what they do and what happens next. Edited excerpts:
Why did you see a need for a website like this?I was eating chicken biryani with my family in a reputed restaurant and realized that my wife made a much better version. So, I asked her how much would it cost to make a similar portion at home. She said around Rs70-80. The restaurant, however, had charged us Rs240. While it made sensewhen you factor in the ambience, service and taxesI also began to wonder about people who simply wanted a good plate of biryani and couldnt cook it themselves.This got me thinking about people who were away from home due to work or education and did not have the time or inclination to cook. There are home-makers all over the country who are excellent cooks and there are people craving for good home-cooked food, so it would make sense to connect them on a web platform. This way, homemakers could make money by cooking an extra portion while starving people could get a good home-cooked meal. India has a number of homemakers whose skills are largely underutilized and we saw this as a great opportunity to empower and create micro-entrepreneurs. That was the rationale behind watscooking.How does it work? What are the current offerings?Any aspiring individual who cooks well can get on watscooking and list the dishes they can offer in a matter of 10 minutes. They can offer home-cooked food, home-made chocolates, cakes, sweets or food products like masala powders, pickles, etc. The sellers have the option to deliver food themselves or get it picked up. Users can identify the people offering food and products within their neighbourhood either using the website or our mobile app and make a request to connect with the seller. They can then communicate with each other and close the transaction.What was your initial investment? Do you plan to seek funding?When we started, we just wanted to enable homemakers to earn from their homes. Surprisingly, a large number of people began to show interest, both sellers and buyers, in a short span of time. So, we realized the need for a more comprehensive platform, a mobile app, customer service, etc., and invested more than $40,000 to get to where we are now.We started yearly membership subscriptions, from as low as Rs599 per year for sellers on the platform a month ago and got more than 100 paid sellers. With more than 100 million potential home-based sellers, this business model is highly lucrative and the market is global. Now, we plan to seek funding to strengthen technology and marketing.Can you give me a sense of scale? How many home chefs do you have registered? How many cities?We currently have around 5,000 registered home chefs across 100-plus cities and around five countries (US, UK, UAE, Singapore and Malaysia). We have the most number of sellers in tier-I and tier-II cities of India, with 1,200 in Chennai, 900 in Bengaluru, 600-plus in Mumbai, Delhi and the rest in other cities. We also have 20,000 registered users already. Every day, we receive more than 50 new registrationssellers and users. We hope to get around 100,000 registered home chefs in the next two years.What are your biggest challenges?The biggest challenge is the unstructured nature of the business. The sellers in the platform may have other priorities, such as taking care of their children. Hence, we introduced many flexible features on the platformfor instance, they can make their profile offline if they are travelling. Also, for the users, we emphasize on networking and social aspects rather than seeing the home chefs as commercial sellers. The core concept of the platform is to enable a sharing economy based on peer-to-peer trust rather than a buyer/seller marketplace.A home chefs reputation is built on user reviews and ratings. The best rated home chef tops the list and it drives the quality. In addition, we have our customer support team monitoring their contents and transactions, regulating the quality.What are the benefits of this for stay-at-home mothers/homemakers?Watscooking enables them to earn extra money, get a sense of identity, lots of confidence and independence.Where is this most successful and why? Do you see any trend among the people who opt for this?The growth is phenomenal in metros like Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru and Chennai, due to working couples, migrants and students living away from home.What are your next plans?We plan to introduce our next version of the mobile app, introduce festive portals for people to sell homemade sweets on occasions like Ganesh Chaturthi and Diwali.

The view around that time (that the) PC was dead created an opportunity for us. Many customers are not giving up on PCs. Liken this to transportation, where people use different modes like bicycles, cars, trains and planes. Computing is like that too with tablets, smartphones, PCs, etc. PCs offer another way of computing.But PCs, servers, storage, etc. are commoditized businesses... ...in the PC segment, we have gained share for 15 quarters in a row. We are doing very well, we are growing. When a commercial client chooses Dell PCs, it chooses us for the services and support and also Intel and AMD (Advanced Micro Devices Inc.) and Microsoft. Its another way of saying these are our suppliers that have a higher share. Therefore, we should be more concerned about our suppliers if margin erosion is a concern. ALSO READ | Will Dell make it big with EMC?One of the reasons for our success is because we have brought tremendous value for our customers, democratized technology by making it more available and more affordable. There is no shortage of competitors in the business we are in. We need to provide high levels of service, continue to innovate, build great relationships and customers will reward us.How are you tackling issues around cultural challenges in the merged Dell-EMC entity? We had a decade-and-a-half lead-up to the combination. And it goes back to 2001 when we had announced an alliance called Dell EMC. The apparent intent was that Dell was going to sell EMC storage technologies to its customers. We did billions of dollars of sales. Under the cover, Dell server technology was embedded into pretty much every storage product line that existed and EMC became our largest OEM (original equipment manufacturer) customer in the world. And so our teams, beginning 2001, learnt how to work together in terms of supply chain, R&D, sales and importantly culturewe became friends.The businesses dont have a lot of overlap. In 2009, we had a fairly in-depth look at whether we should combine the companiesreams of analyses, we had consultants from both companies, we had directors from the boards of both the public companies meeting secretly in places, and we were negotiating combining both the companies. However, because of the financial crisis at that time, we decided not to do so.Then, in 2013, we took the company private. Everyone thought the PC was dead. So, we bought the company back. Thank you very much. And in 2014, I called my friend Joe Tucci (Joseph Tucci is the former chairman, president and chief executive officer of EMC) and said, Why dont we re-examine what we looked at five years earlier, refresh all the analyses and see if it makes sense now? So, that was more than two years ago, which resulted in our October 2015 result.I got some great advice. I talked to a number of executives who had gone through a number of combinations like thesesome had succeeded; some had failed. One of the things that a number of them said: You should as early you can, communicate the strategy of the new company and its structure. They also said, with all due respect to the current CEO of EMC, you should act as if you were leading the new company from the day of the announcement of the planned merger, not the closure date. Legally, you are not supposed to do that. And I didnt break any laws.ALSO READ | Dell Technologiess road map for IndiaI was very present within EMC from the day of the announcementat the leadership meetings, meeting the whole team, learning about the teams, and as we come together as one family and the cultures are a lot more similar than different.Whats the strategy you are employing to handle a smooth integration? We communicated the hierarchies within the organization to our teams. Not everyone has got exactly the job they want. Given the all-star teams we have in the combined Dell-EMC group, we effectively have an Olympic team. You must always start with the strategy. If you do it by personality or anything else, it will be a totally wrong way to do it. From the strategy, you must define the structure to achieve the strategy. You lay out the strategy. Then find out who are the people from within, or outside, the organization for each role to accomplish the strategy.For each role, you have several candidates. So you find the jobare you excited about the job, are you passionate. Some may want to play golf, instead.But if you are great and want to be part of the Olympic team, we have one heck of an opportunity for you.",2016-11-15,coPcc4KKMyYKPYYwlo7ukJ,Dell CEO Michael Dell on the prospects for the combined Dell-EMC,05:00,"In firms, PCs and smartphones coexist in a multi-device world: Michael Dell"
0.25,"The announcement of the imminent commercial launch of services by its telecom unitReliance Jio Infocomm Ltdat its annual general meeting has augured well for the Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) stock. Its share price has risen 7.5% from its recent low on 2 September. But its worth remembering that the stock has been an underperformer compared to the benchmark Sensex so far this year.
				   
				If you thought September quarter results would change sentiments dramatically, you are likely be disappointed. Stand-alone revenues have declined year-on-year but better operating profit margin, strong other income growth, and decline in finance and depreciation costs have helped the company report 20% growth in its pre-tax earnings. But that wont impress investors. Heres why: stand-alone Ebitda for September quarter came in at Rs10,555 crore. A poll of Bloomberg analysts was expecting the companys Ebitda at Rs10,569 crore. Thats pretty much in line. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.Unlike the June quarter when RILs gross refining margin (GRM) had surprised the Street positively, this quarter was fairly lukewarm. To be fair, GRM of $10.1 a barrel is not bad at all. The companys premium over Singapore GRM has dropped to $5 a barrel from as much as $6.5 a barrel. But investors are unlikely to punish the stock for that. For one, the companys GRM margin is slightly better than some brokerage firms estimates. Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd was expecting a GRM of $10 a barrel while analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd had forecasted a GRM between $9.5-10 a barrel.What really came as a big surprise this quarter is the performance of the petrochemicals business. According to the company, consolidated petrochemicals Ebit margin expanded to a 14-quarter high of 15.2% for the September quarter as product deltas held up well despite lower prices. Delta is the rate of change in prices compared with the change in unit costs. Strong volume growth also helped. Stand-alone petrochemicals Ebit increased to 16.3%, higher sequentially as well as on a year-on-year basis.As usual, the oil and gas business was a laggard, with Ebit declining as much as 83% year-on-year, adversely impacted by lower upstream production in domestic blocks along with lower prices. Sure, RILs organized retail business has done well but the segment is too small to make a big difference to overall numbers.On a consolidated basis, the companys debt service coverage ratio has declined to 0.88 from 2.79 in the June quarter. Is that a worry? According to independent analyst S.P. Tulsian, the decline in debt service coverage ratio should hardly be a concern for a company with RILs cash flows. Other analysts say the fall in the debt service ratio below 1 is just for one quarter and should not be extrapolated.What of the stock? Currently, RIL trades at 12.4 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year. Valuations arent exactly cheap considering that the refining environment is still sluggish. So far this quarter, benchmark Singapore GRM has averaged only marginally higher at $5.3 a barrel, says an analyst. RILs net debt has increased by about Rs10,000 crore sequentially to Rs1.06 trillion. Investors should watch out for that measure in the days to come.

0.02,"Dallas: Facebook Inc. chief executive Mark Zuckerberg took the witness stand in Dallas federal court on Tuesday and denied an allegation by a rival company that the virtual-reality technology of Facebooks Oculus unit was stolen.
				   
				Zuckerberg, the founder of one of the worlds largest companies, faced hours of tough, public questioning about where Oculus obtained its ideas and how much he knew about the start-up when Facebook bought it for $2 billion. A jury is hearing evidence in a civil lawsuit brought by videogame publisher ZeniMax Media Inc. against Oculus in 2014, in the middle of the Facebook-Oculus deal. ZeniMax said that Oculus unlawfully used its intellectual property to develop the virtual-reality system that includes the Rift headset.During one heated exchange with ZeniMax lawyer Tony Sammi, Zuckerberg told a jury in the crowded courtroom that the technology was not even fully formed when Facebook bought it. Improving on that technology doesnt make it yours, Sammi countered. If you steal my bike, paint it and put a bell on it, does that make it your bike?Zuckerberg, wearing a dark suit and striped tie rather than his typical T-shirt and jeans, answered, no, but then added: The idea that Oculus technology is based on someone elses is just wrong.The 32-year-old Facebook founder has spoken about virtual reality as an important part of the companys future business, especially as the technology becomes less expensive and its uses clearer. The Oculus acquisition was more expensive than the $2 billion price tag indicated, Zuckerberg said in court, describing $700 million spent to retain employees and $300 million in payouts for reaching milestones. Oculus originally wanted $4 billion, he said. Sammi questioned whether Facebook knew what it was doing when it made the acquisition. Zuckerberg said the Oculus deal was done over a weekend in 2014, which Sammi said did not show sufficient due diligence. Zuckerberg said, though, in later testimony that Facebook researched Oculus for months.At the time, Zuckerberg testified, he was not aware of any theft claims against Oculus. Its pretty common when you announce a big deal that people just come out of the woodwork and claim they own some part of the deal, Zuckerberg said. On the stand, he also gave details about Facebooks $22 billion purchase of messaging service WhatsApp in 2014. While the deal was in progress, another company he did not identify made a last-minute bid that was higher, Zuckerberg said, but WhatsApp declined because of its good relationship with Facebook.The Oculus lawsuit, in the sixth day of a jury trial, relates in part to programmer John Carmack. Well-known for helping to conceive games such as Quake and Doom, Carmack worked for id Software Llc before that company was acquired by ZeniMax. He is now the chief technology officer at Oculus. Zuckerberg denied that Carmack has unfairly used computer code from his previous position. There is no shared code in what we do, he said. Zuckerberg said he has been interested in virtual reality since he was a student, but thought it was decades away from happening before he encountered Oculus. He told jurors how he used virtual reality to capture his daughters first steps, so her grandparents could experience it later. We want to get closer to this kind of perfect representation, so you can capture a moment you had, he said.

0.06,"A few days before Twitters 8 September board meeting, as the companys finance team readied a presentation, it received conflicting directions on a crucial question. Should their slides reflect Twitters prospects as an independent company or delve into the benefits of getting acquired?
				   
				Jack Dorsey, Twitters chief executive officer, argued that the 10-year-old company should remain on its current course and work to capitalize on recent product improvements and success in streaming live video, people familiar with the discussions said. Ev Williams, a former CEO who has a history of clashing with Dorsey, was in favour of exploring a sale. Other directors agreed they had a fiduciary duty to consider that option. The board ultimately decided to consider takeover prospects after getting an expression of interest from a potential acquirer, which led it to hire Goldman Sachs and Allen & Co. to evaluate possible bids.After pitching the San Francisco-based social network, the bankers received inquiries from suitors which so far include Disney and Salesforce, with Google also weighing a potential bid. This week, the board is consulting with other outside advisers on how to deal with the internal disagreement over a possible sale, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the process is private. Formal bids could come within a couple of weeksor not at all.Though its fate is in flux, one thing is clear: A year after he officially took back the reins as CEO, Jack Dorsey has either ceded or lost at least some control over the future of the company he helped create. On the board, he may be overruled by fellow directors on the future of Twitter as an independent company. Within his management team, hes largely delegated command of Twitters strategy to chief financial officer Anthony Noto. And among advertisers, Twitters fortunes are being constrained by its stagnant user numbers, which Dorseys product changes have failed to significantly boost, and by growing concern about harassment and abuse on its service.Also Read: Possible Disney merger with Twitter poses risks for Bob Iger legacyThe lack of growth in users and engagement underscore that Jacks initiatives thus far havent really been effective, said Robert Peck, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. If this whole live idea doesnt work, then what is it that gets Twitter to grow?Twitter spokeswoman Kristin Binns declined to comment on the boards discussions about a potential sale process. Asked to provide perspective on Dorseys progress, Binns said in an e-mail that the CEO has met the goals he outlined a year ago and made significant strides in each of his priorities for the company. The company has been rolling out products faster than ever, she noted, and has boosted engagement through enhancements to the timeline, such as showing people the most relevant tweets first. She also cited the companys advancements and partnerships in live video streaming, including deals to broadcast NFL games and presidential debates.As Twitters first CEO, Dorsey was initially known as a detail-obsessed micromanager. He was ousted in 2008, then brought back to Twitterwhich was having trouble attracting new usersto apply vision and direction with the kind of authority that only a founder can bring.But Dorsey hasnt seemed interested in being the sole authority on Twitters future, according to insiders. While he was away from Twitter, he built a credit-card reader company, Square Inc., and learned the importance of trusting others with strategic decisions. His leadership style in the past year at Twitter has been Socratic, not prescriptive, these people said. Hell ask open-ended questions to spark debate, like, Are we preventing people from expressing themselves fully with our 140-character tweet limit? What would a different solution look like?Also Read: Twitter bidders vying for data would inherit the doldrums tooThe discussions eventually lead to solutions, like Twitters move last month to exclude photos and attachments from a tweets character total. But the process takes time. And that passive, contemplative style created a void in management that Noto has stepped in to fill, people said.Noto has been just as responsible, just as influential at the company as Jack, said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. Hes been unusually active as a CFO.Earlier this year, Noto told Twitters other senior staff that he intended to bid for the rights to stream 10 Thursday night National Football League games. He wasnt expecting to win, but he wanted to try, according to people familiar with the conversations.Noto, who is a former CFO of the NFL, did winfor the bargain price of $10 million, lower than what others were willing to pay. That kicked off a string of other deals in sports, politics and entertainment, centered on making Twitter accessible to a wider audience through live video they can watch for free. The first NFL game drew 2.3 million users, and the next one got 2.4 million, hinting at the potential for a growing audience, according to the company.Its not that Dorsey has been uninvolved. On the contrary, his employees say he answers e-mails so quickly that its difficult to imagine how he has the time, given that hes also still CEO of Square. During his first month at Twitter, he cut 8% of the workforce. He recruited new board members like Debra Lee, the CEO of BET, and Hugh Johnston, the CFO of Pepsico, to add executive experience. Hes helped the strategy by providing a long-term perspective on the business and focused on a single concept to help drive it: live.But if Dorsey is the introverted deep thinker, Noto is the doer. Hes the high-energy cheerleader who has cut through indecision at the company and rallied Twitters employees around a future of live video streaming, boosted by licensing of premium content. (Twitter has partnered with Bloomberg LP to stream some Bloomberg TV shows, as well as the presidential debates.) Its unusual for a companys CFO to be leading its product vision, and even rarer at a technology company.Twitters engineers have long grappled with how to make the service easier to use, cycling through six heads of product in six years. Notos deal-making provided them with a unique solution: to make video an entry point to the Twitter experience. Twitter recently released streaming applications for Apple TV, Xbox and Amazon Fire TV, letting viewers pick content that streams alongside related tweets, and sidestepping the need for people to create an account and decide who to followpreviously a cumbersome prerequisite of using Twitter.Twitter hired Noto in 2014 with more than $60 million in stock options, following a career in banking at Goldman Sachs, where he helped Twitter go public. Its unclear whether Noto supports a Twitter sale. But he did recently retain Goldman to look at other options, like selling off assets besides the core business, according to people familiar. Notos presence at the company has long been a comfort to investors, with many figuring that if it came time to sell, he would know how to get it done.Even as the company gains ground in streaming, Dorsey is being forced to reconsider Twitters future in part because its lack of user growth. US average monthly users have hovered around 66 million for six quarters. Revenue, which more than doubled in 2014, is projected to rise just 15% this year, and to slow further next year.Advertisers see potential in the companys live video strategy, but theyre also being wooed by photo- and video-sharing app Snapchat, and Facebooks Instagram, which has recently become more advertiser-friendly. At the time of Twitters 2013 initial public offering, those services werent close competitors. Now they both have larger daily audiences than Twitter.Also Read: Twitter could take many forms, depending on new ownerTwitter budgets have slowly gone down and down and down, said James Douglas, who consults with advertisers on their spending as executive director of social media for Society, an agency within IPG Mediabrands whose clients include Coca-Cola and Red Bull. Its kind of hard to compel clients who had an experience with Twitter that wasnt good, or have the perception that Twitters audience is declining. Everyone has questions for them, Douglas said.Tom Buontempo, the president of Attention, the social arm of ad firm KBS, said hes seen the trend worsen in recent months. Its all a matter of where people are spending their time, he said. Im starting to hear more clients consider whether or not they need to be on Twitter at all. Attentions clients include BMW, Mattel and Lincoln Financial, though Buontempo wouldnt say who is pulling back.When Twitters CEO search committee was looking to replace Dick Costolo in 2015, they made calls to major investors, asking for input and floating Dorseys name as a contender. Some investors expressed their skepticism, given that Dorsey was already a large influence on Costolo, and could already impact the companys direction through his executive chairman role.Still, one year ago this week, Twitters board was jubilant on a conference call announcing the decision to bring back Dorsey permanently. Dorsey would help us achieve what we see as a massive opportunity to grow the company, Peter Currie, who helped lead the search and has since left the board, said at the time. The board has been pleased and impressed with the strategy, vision and alignment around goals coming from the Twitter teams these last few months, and there is much more the world hasnt seen just yet.Perhaps there is more to come. But some investors havent been willing to wait.Twitters stock had dropped about 20% this year before reports began to surface about the company considering a sale. Even one of its largest and earliest investors, Chris Sacca, a vocal critic of Twitters strategy under Costolo and proponent of bringing back Dorsey, has sold a large part of his stake, he told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday.Brad Slingerlend, who manages the global technology fund for Janus Capital Group, holds Facebook, Google, Amazon and Applebut sold Twitter after Dorsey took over. Social networking, he said, is a business that depends on a network effect to generate growth. If the networks momentum starts to ebb, its difficult to recover.The best-case scenario, Slingerlend said, would be an acquisition by Disney. As Twitter becomes more of a media company, the two make for a good fit, he said. And Disneys CEO, Bob Iger, has experience bringing a brand back to life.Jack is a good entrepreneur, Slingerlend said. But Twitter needs a turnaround CEO, and thats a completely different job. Bloomberg",2016-10-07,dpyqCrv7e3VSybEzZJ4glL,"A year after Jack Dorseys return as Twitter s CEO, live-streaming and new products havent revived growth",19:32,How Jack Dorsey is losing control of Twitter

Outside, the afternoon sun makes everything sparkle as barges and boats criss-cross the Arabian Sea against the backdrop of the imposing Gateway of India.
				   
				Its 3pm. Pramath Raj Sinha hasnt had lunch. The 52-year-old entrepreneur had flown into Mumbai that morning and had just finished speaking at a business school event on education. Sinha was the founding dean of the Indian School of Business (ISB), Hyderabad, and is co-founder of Ashoka University, Sonipat, Haryana. His most recent venture is the Vedica Scholars Programme for Women in Delhi, an alternative masters in business administration (MBA) programme. This all-women residential programme tries to address the problem that far more women graduate from high school than men, but get left behind in careers. Sinha says he was inspired by institutions like Wellesley College of Massachusetts, US, where women get the confidence to express themselves. The Vedica curriculum includes subjects that many conventional MBAs neglect, like politics, sociology and history. The first batch of 36 Vedica scholars has just graduated and Sinha informs me that one student has received an offer from Google at a starting salary of Rs22 lakh.By now we have settled into our seaside seats and turned our attention to the menu. We debate the relative merits of keema ghotala (a spicy Parsi keema with bread), a smoked salmon sandwich or a BLT burger, and end up settling for the latter two. Sinha grew up in Patna, in a house with a printing press. His father and grandfather were writers. Writing didnt pay all the bills, so Sinhas father started a small textbook-publishing business to supplement his income and pay for the education of his four childrenthree daughters and Pramath, who was the youngest. Sinha recalls going on marketing trips with his father in winter. We called it canvassing; we would fill the car with calendars and diaries and call on schoolteachers with these gifts. I thought it was a lot of fun; only later I realized it was serious marketing, he says. Years later, it was another printing press that drew Sinha back to the country of his birth. By then, he was an alumnus of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, with a PhD in applied mechanics and robotics from the University of Pennsylvania, US, and had been working as a consultant since 1993 with McKinsey & Co. in Toronto. And then one day he was assigned to a project on newsprint. The project was  in Canada, but it had an India component. Sinha tells me about the days he spent in India at the time, visiting newspaper offices and finally working at the Ballarpur Industries paper plant as part of the project. It was an almost surreal existence. At one level you are working for McKinsey, which in Toronto was boardrooms and office and always talking to CEOs. Here in India, I was in a paper plant in Haryana, living in a guest house with an Indian toilet and a dhobi visiting every day. We were sitting in our ganjis every night because it was so hot. Hanging out with the workers, speaking in Bhojpuri with the Bihari labourers, having shouting matches with the union. Such experiences, and work in the newsprint and media sector in India, made Sinha want to return. He started working with McKinsey India in 1995 on a project basis and moved full-time in 1997.By now the salmon sandwich and the BLT burger have arrived, and we have half portions of each, complete with fries. Sinha begins talking about the ISB story. He was involved with the institute right from the planning stage and even took a year off from McKinsey to be the founding dean. The story has all the elements of high dramaa cast of powerful industrialists, including Adi Godrej, Anand Mahindra and Rajat Gupta, chief ministers, and complicated negotiations. Most of these took place 1999 onwards, but for Sinha, the introduction to education and institutions had come even earlier.In 1995, McKinsey India began working on a project with management guru Kenichi Ohmae and then Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, on ways to transform that country into a knowledge economy. Sinha was assigned to this project, and it became the first of many such university projects for him. A PhD in robotics doesnt make you a guy who knows how to build a university, says Sinha of those early days. But this was where he first began institution-building. The ISB started as a project McKinsey was doing with the Indian Institute of Technology, DelhiSinha has since come out with a book about setting it up, An Idea Whose Time Has Come: The Story Of The Indian School Of Business.Over a cup of Darjeeling first flush, Sinha tells me about the day ISBs board of governors visited three states and three chief ministers. Their first stop was Hyderabad, where then chief minister Chandrababu Naidu pulled out all the stops. The chief minister sent his ratha to receive us, a bus with sofa seats, and we were taken to the site for the business school. On the way back to the airport, the bus was redirected to the CMs house. He welcomed us all, garlanded us and served us breakfast in his house. Afterwards we were taken to an adjoining room and given a presentation on Hyderabad as a knowledge hub, Sinha recalls. The team was charmed, but behind schedule. In Bengaluru, then chief minister J.H. Patel and his team were furious at the delay. The CM didnt speak a single word to us. And then when we reached Chennai, we were asked to garland the CM, Jayalalithaa. We were taken to see the venue which was supposed to have a lake, and we walked and walked to see the lake, but there was no lake. So in one day, we saw three chief ministers, all such contrasts of each other. One garlanded us, the other didnt speak to us and the third wanted us to garland her, Sinha says. Not surprisingly, the ISB was built in Hyderabad. Sinha is currently on its executive and governing boards.From being the founding dean of ISB, Sinha returned to work at McKinsey in 2002, then left to head the ABP Pvt. Ltd as the groups managing director and CEO in 2006. In 2007, he set up his own media company, 9.9 Mediaworx Pvt. Ltd. Like much of the media, 9.9 has had uneven economic growth. Its Rs45-crore-turnover business in 2015-16 includes magazines and websites like Digit, CIO, CFO and some consulting projects. In 2010, Sinha tried setting up a business school in Vadodara on the lines of the ISB but had to give up the idea because the school was not able to generate enough demand at the price point he had thought of. Currently, he is working with consulting and implementing project proposals at the Crescent School of Business in Chennai, the Anant National University in Ahmedabad and the Shoolini University in Solan. The Union government is planning a railway university in Vadodara and Sinha plans to bid for that project. Sinha and his wife Gauri live in Delhi. They dont have children, so Sinha says he has all the time to fill my weekends and free time with all the different things I do. By 5pm, Sinha is ready to leave for the airport for his flight back to Delhi. His last meeting for the day is with an alumnus of Ashoka, a Young India fellow.

Edited excerpts from an interview conducted by Bridgespan in partnership with Mint:
				   
				How did you start your philanthropic journey?I grew up in a family that was driven by philanthropy. My grandmother with whom we spent a great deal of timeshe brought us up because my parents were separatedinfluenced me. We were steeped into philanthropy, whether it would be for the household staff or the person on the street. She was in fact for a period of time, the chairperson of the Sir Ratan Tata Trust. We grew up in that aura of giving back to the people or alleviating misery if we could. Formally I became involved with philanthropy when I became a trustee of the Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Were there people or incidents or experiences that you used to inform your approach to philanthropy, the formal version of it?As a young man growing up, it was the environment that I spoke of, which set the pace and the tone of my journey of how one makes contributions to make a difference.How is the Sir Ratan Tata Trust changing from its old avatar?We look at our trusts collectively. The bigger ones undertook projects of philanthropy which were very far reaching in those days, be it a cancer hospital or a hotel that would be open to Indians or donations in the interest of tuberculosis. My grandmother gave away all the homes she and her husband had all over India so that sanatoriums for consumptive people, who needed to be isolated, could be made or old peoples homes could be set up. And then a fair amount of philanthropy was in the form of alleviating individual hardships, such as funds for treatment or surgery. We give much more than we did in those days but we are trying to be relevant. We are trying to participate in research for cancer, for diabetes, getting institutes in place to make the treatments affordable and reachable to the common man, looking at agricultural inputs that alleviate poverty in a rural community. What has led to this shift broadly?I cant say that there was a motivator that was defined. For example, one of the big changes has been combating malnutrition today among infants. Just the fact that we are losing so many children in India at infancy. It took only a few weeks of research to realize that we couldnt do that without involving the mother, who is also malnutritioned. We also found out very fast that we couldnt really do much unless we focused on hygiene and sanitation. It become a holistic activity. We undertook pilot projects in eight districts across multiple states to work out the systems for this and its been a real eye-opener. We have received tremendous support from the state government whom we were working with.Any advice for a philanthropist thinking about doing problem solving?The only advice I would give is there is a lot of money that is probably less effectively used or employed because someone has not done enough research on what the problems are. One of the changes we made is that we are no longer a purely grant-giving philanthropic organization. We moved from there into being involved ourselves in some of the projects that we have, we manage them ourselves or jointly with an NGO (non-governmental organization) but not only through an NGO.In the past, we would support an NGO for eight years or 10 years and then move those funds and allocate in another place. You would assume that this community by now would be self-sustaining. But when you withdrew your funds, the NGO collapsed, the community collapsed and you become the most hated person or hated organization there is. Sustainability in development has been a new call and we realize that communities dont need handoutsthey need prosperity and dignity. So our grants today, wherever we give them, put sustainability as one of the mileposts. I mean as far as possible, the idea is to make the community self-sustaining and have the dignity which I think everybody wants. How do you measure your success ?I think to a great extent it is about trying to establish and understanding what the real problems are. You have got to define your goals effectively.What characterizes a professionalized NGO?I cant answer that particularly but sometimes its not scale. Very often an NGO tends to forget the traditional outlooks of a community and ignore it, so that what they try to dohowever well intentioneddoesnt work.What is your assessment of the current state of CSR (corporate social responsibility) in India? And what needs to be done to improve it?I have a sort of philosophical view. The CSR funds have to come from somewhere. I think there would be a fair amount of abuse of these funds and the government will have to do some regulation to make sure that these are effectively used. It would not be a bad thing if the government had defined X number of causes to which you can officially give these funds, which would work for rural prosperity. I think even if large projects, a public works projects, were funded in this way, there is nothing wrong in that but the government may have to define what they are. CSR could become an avenue for innovative thinking on how you can improve the quality of life, and it could be a very powerful toolor it could be wasted. How do you see the state of philanthropy in India?I think the new type of philanthropy that we talked about, that is looking at making donations or making funds available in far-reaching terms, is starting to happen. But a large amount of philanthropy is in the more traditional formsmaybe to build temples or hospitals, not so concerned about what it actually does, but that edifices are created because that establishes that you did A or B or C. I think India has to move like other countries into a more sophisticated form of philanthropy which makes a difference and is designed to make a difference rather than just creating edifices. Do you have a philosophy of philanthropy?If I put it into one sentence, I think you really want to be doing things that make a difference. If you cannot make a difference, if its just water trickling through a tap or leading through a drainage system, its wasteful. Have you changed because of the philanthropy? How has it affected you?Yes I think so. I was the chairman of the trust while I was chairman of Tata Sons. I may have chaired the trust but I didnt spend as much time or have had much depth of involvement as I do today and thats been an eye-opener. I have become more sensitive to the pain and the suffering that exists. I am more involved with where we should do more and where we should be bolder in terms of the amount of money that we allocate. And it also made me more sensitive to the likely abuse of funds.The Bridgespan Group, an adviser and resource for mission-driven leaders and organizations, in partnership with Mint interviewed several philanthropists across India to trace their journeys and share their learningsConversations with Remarkable Givers: India.ALSO READ | Philanthropy benefits the philanthropistALSO READ | How a small donation secures freedomALSO READ | Strategic giving for impact",2016-10-03,eZ5raUtIs7kmScXuchQY9M,Tata Sons chairman emeritus Ratan Tata on why poverty alleviation is key to his philanthropy and why access to natural resources is important to improve lives,03:03,You really want to be doing things that make a difference: Ratan Tata
0.22,"The first repercussions of the impending departure of Raghuram Rajan from the Reserve Bank of India could now be visibleand it looks like those who argued the independence of Indias central bank was under threat may have been right.
				   
				Indias aspirations
Rajan declared last month that he would not be seeking the expected extension of his terma move widely seen as being forced on him by the Narendra Modi-led government in New Delhi, which had publicly disagreed with several of his decisions and statements as governor. This was troubling. The government appeared to be uncomfortable with its inability, under Rajan, to direct the central banks actions. The implications for the RBIs institutional stability and strengthand for the credibility of India as an investment destinationwerent good.Some of Rajans latest speeches suggest the government is close to knocking a further hole in the RBIs authority. The governor has spoken out against a suggestion, which is gathering force in New Delhi, to use surplus funds with the RBIits contingent reserve, set aside for emergenciesto recapitalize stressed state-owned banks.The governments motivations are understandable. It has committed itself to a pretty stringent path of fiscal consolidation over the next few years, one that would bring the fiscal deficit down to 3% of gross domestic product. However it has to do this at the same time as Indian banksin particular, the state-controlled banks that comprise 70% of the sectorare dealing with a full-blown bad loans crisis. Estimates of bad loans vary widely, but may total anywhere between six and 12% of GDP. The RBI itself estimates they may hit 8.5% of GDP by next March.Recapitalizing the banks is urgentthey need about $140 billion in capital by 2019, according to Fitch Ratingsbut the government has set aside very little money to do so as yet. And soon after the next federal budget is presented at the end of February 2017, Modis government will probably go into election mode. Polls are due in 2017 in the crucial northern state of Uttar Pradesh, and the next general elections will be just two years away at that point. Its obviously tempting to use the RBIs funds instead of finding money from the general budget.Such a move would reverse years of institutional evolution at the central bank. The RBI used to own significant stakes in some major Indian banksa conflict of interest for the central bank, which regulates the banking sector. Even though a government-appointed committee recommended as early as 1998 that these shares be sold, it wasnt till 2010 that the sale actually took place. Rajans fear is that the current administration wants to reverse this processand hes right, doing so would be disastrous.Other bad ideas for plundering the RBIs reserves have been floated before. In 2004, some ministers wanted to tap $5 billion a year from the surplus fund to finance Indias infrastructure-building program. Fortunately, the RBIwith some timely help from the International Monetary Fundmanaged to hold off the government, greatly enhancing its reputation for independence. (Its worth noting that in this, it did better than the US Federal Reserve, which wasnt able to stave off a law passed by the US Congress last December that dipped into its surplus to pay for US highways.)An attempt to use the RBIs rainy-day cash pile would not just dent the central banks independence, but also the credibility of Indias already shaky fiscal arithmetic. It would make accounting for the exact amount that the government was spending impossible, as well as have unpredictable effects on inflation. It would thus vastly set back the RBIs efforts under Rajan to establish a reputation as an inflation-fighting central bank.Worryingly, the governments apparent willingness to compromise RBI independence seems in keeping with several of its recent decisions. The controversial departure of Rajan is one such. The purpose was presumably to replace him with a choice with whom the government is more comfortable, perhaps its chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian, who first suggested dipping into RBI funds in his annual economic survey earlier this year.The fact that the government has chosen to ignore the obvious means of recapitalizing banks is also revealing. The state-owned banking sector shouldnt be bailed out using RBI funds, of coursebut not by using tax money either. Instead, it should be guided towards privatization, and funds for recapitalizing the best banks should be raised from the markets. But movement on this is slow. Modi himself doesnt seem too sympathetic to privatization.Indias prime minister came into office promising maximum governance, minimum government. Thats what both the RBI and the banking sector need, not renewed state control.

0.58,"This weeks acrimonious separation between the chairman of Tata Group and its majority owners may now be heading for a divorce. Ratan Tata, who returned to head the conglomerate after ousting Cyrus Pallonji Mistry, is looking for a partner to buy the ex-chairmans stake, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.
				   
				Should Mistry agree to sell, how much can he hope to get for his familys 18.4% of Tata Sons Ltd?Bear in mind that following his dismissal, Mistry raised some very serious allegations about both the holding company and several of its biggest publicly traded units. In hitting back at the board that fired him, Mistry said the groups net worth of $26 billion could be impaired by as much as $18 billionshrinking to just $8 billionshould writedowns be needed at businesses like Tata Steel Ltds European operations; Tata Motors Ltds passenger car business (ex-Jaguar Land Rover, the jewel in the empires crown); Indian Hotels Co.s overseas Taj properties; one of Tata Power Ltd.s plants; and a floundering wireless telecom venture with NTT Docomo Inc.As a seller, Mistry is unlikely to behave anything like a spurned chairman trying to score debating points. To maximize value, he might say he overestimated the risk of Armageddon. He might even admit the possibility that Ratan Tatas return to a conglomerate he chaired for two decades will reinvigorate the operating companies. Maybe Tata cant repeat a near sevenfold increase in book value over the period 2004-2012, but if global steel demand stabilizes, theres a fair chance the groups assets could reach a book value of $28 billion after a year. In the base-case scenario, the coffee-to-cars-to-software conglomerate wont be any worse off, and its assets would be worth in 2017 what they are today: $26 billion.Now suppose that status quo has a likelihood of 50%, while the probability of a massive writedown is 20%, and that of an improvement is 30%. That gives a one-year-forward book value of $23 billion. Considering that General Electric Co. trades at three times its estimated book value for next year, and companies in the more diversified Tata Group sell at 4.8 times, Mistry could perhaps ask for a halfway-house multiple of 3.75 times, valuing his 18.4% stake at a little under $16 billion.Only a patient investor who cares more about growth than current income would be willing to write that check. After all, the dividend received from operating companies yielded just 1.6% on Tata Sons investment last year, according to the Economic Times. An investor who paid a multiple of 3.75 to relieve Mistry of his stake would earn a divided yield of 0.4%.As for Mistry himself, at $16 billion, he would walk away with an annualized 4.5% return on the $200 million loan the Tata family took from outsiders 91 years ago. Include past dividends, and he might even have matched or beaten the 9% annual return from the US stock market since 1928. Thats hardly a divorce to feel unhappy about.

-0.01,"Bengaluru: Tata Group chairman Cyrus Mistry has a new worry in the growing pile of troubles afflicting Indias largest conglomerate. How to revive growth at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), which accounts for 16% of the groups $103.5 billion revenue?
				   
				The troubles at Tata Motors Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd are well-documented. Despite TCS reporting a 3.7% sequential dollar revenue growth in the April-June period, the company is likely to report weak numbers in the second quarter, results of which will be declared on 13 October.Worryingly for investors, TCS now risks growing at a slower clip this year than last year, when its revenue expanded 7.1%, the slowest annual growth at TCS since 2009, when Natarajan Chandrasekaran took charge as its chief executive. TCS is expected to report an at-best 1.6% sequential dollar growth in the second quarter, according to brokerage BNP Paribas. This, on the back of 3.7% growth in the first quarter, translates into TCS doing $8.79 billion business in the first six months of the current financial year. TCS now needs more than $8.92 billion in revenue in second half of the year if it intends to grow at 7.1% this year. Simply put, TCS will need to record a better show in the October-March period this year than in the second half of last year. This certainly is a tall task as technology outsourcing firms report soft growth in the second half of the financial year.Undoubtedly, Chandrasekaran faces a tough task given the size of TCS.At the heart of TCSs slow growth is its inability to build a stronger consulting practice and reluctance to buy small firms for technologies like design consulting and automation platform providers. These tiny buyouts not just improve the current solution deliveries but also bring in growth. May be now, Mistry could nudge Chandrasekaran to start buying.With this as a backdrop, Mint puts the spotlight on five things to watch in TCSs second quarter earnings on 13 October:1. Revenue growthBrokerage BNP Paribas expects TCSs dollar revenue to rise 1.6% to $4.43 billion in the July-September period on a sequential basis. This is a big worry as this will mean that TCS needs to put forward its best foot forward in the remaining six months of the year if it wants to save itself from the humiliation of recording an even slower growth than last year. Management commentary on demand levels from its customers in Europe, after Britain voted to leave the EU, will be crucial.2. Pressure on profitability poses a double whammySince January this year, TCSs operating margins have been under pressure. TCSs 26.1% Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin at the end of March quarter was 54 basis points less than margins at the end of October-December period last year. The companys margins further contracted to 25.1% at the end of March quarter, which the management claimed to be largely on account of annual wage hikes. Now, as commoditized deals come under further pricing pressure, and TCS continues to spend money in reskilling its workforce and building digital technologies, traditional levers like going slow on hiring, will not be enough to offset the gradual decline in profitability. Analysts say that TCS is unlikely to end the current financial year with its stated guidance of 26-28%.3. What really is the problem among TCSs BFSI clients in the US?On 7 September, TCS in a mid-quarter update, said that some holding back of discretionary spending particularly in the BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance clients) vertical in the United States had led to sequential loss of momentum at the company. Is this just an one-off development or does this suggest a structural malaise? We know all IT vendors are seeing less business from big banks as these banks are spending less in application development work. Homegrown technology vendors are further seeing erosion in current revenue from the embrace of automation platforms, which is cannibalizing the existing model of billing clients on human hours. 4. Rain check of weak sectors and geographiesTCS does not expect growth to rebound in Japan. The company claims to have arrested any loss of business from its UK-based insurance platform Diligenta. Growth from telecoms segment continue to be wobbly. Together, an underperformance from the three units eroded about 2% growth from the companys 11.9% growth on constant currency basis in 2015-16. TCS needs to report some growth on a consistent basis if it has to better last years growth.5. Is higher net erosion of existing business biting into TCSs growth?During the July-September period last year, TCS claimed its order book was the strongest ever, with about 30% more than the company ever managed in any quarter. The company, however, does not disclose its order book size. Outsourcing deals are long-term contracts, and IT vendors can generate only about 3-4% of revenue from new orders in the first year, according to JPMorgan Chases George. Agreed, IT firms lose about 3-5% of current business every year, which in TCSs case, translates into a loss of about $500-825 million a year. This clearly suggest that TCS is losing more business from existing clients because even some business generated from its record order book has not offset the annual loss of business, thereby resulting in a sluggish y-o-y growth.",2016-10-12,hesaBaeP0eIEHrwSnqJO5K,TC is likely to report weak numbers in the second quarter and risks growing at a slower clip this year than last year,01:16,TCS Q2 earnings: Five things to watch for today
0.74,"New Delhi: The practice of forcing industries to cross-subsidize household consumers power tariffs is leading to an unprecedented shift among businesses towards captive solar power with some committing to go fully reliant on clean energy.
				   
				Cost of producing solar power, which was over Rs12 per kilowatt hour (unit) in 2010, has dropped sharply over the years. The latest auction, which was held in November, saw takers for solar power projects willing to sell power at Rs3 a unit. The fall in solar power generation cost has now made it attractive for businesses to go for captive solar power plants, including rooftop plants that supply power cheaper than from the grid, which is expensive on account of the cross-subsidy that industrial consumers are saddled with. Businesses, especially in the manufacturing sector, have long been complaining of high cost of power, exorbitant tax on diesel and escalating cost of capital as factors that render them less competitive in global markets where their peers enjoy low or negative cost of capital and in some cases, subsidies. Solar power is now available at Rs 4-4.5 a unit. In the future, it will cost much less because of technology improvement and possibly low cost of capital. In West Bengal, for instance, cost of power from the grid for industries ranges from Rs 6-8 per unit at present. In Maharashtra, it is Rs 6.5 a unit. Everywhere, except two or three states, tariffs are above Rs 5 a unit for industrial consumers. If you are able to get concessional finance from any multilateral agency and you can produce solar power at Rs 4 a unit consistently for 25 years, it can reduce cost of energy for the business and reduce carbon emissions, said Mahendra Singhi, chief executive officer, Dalmia Cements (Bharat) Ltd. Dalmia Cementss short term goal is to raise the share of clean energy in its total electricity consumption fourfold from 7% at present and to go fully reliant on clean energy in the long term. Multilateral agencies such as International Finance Corp. (IFC), the private investment arm of World Bank Group, US Exim Bank, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Japan International Cooperation Agency and Germanys KFW are bullish on Indias rapidly expanding renewable energy industry for investment opportunities. We already have $1 billion of investments in clean energy projects in India. We are open to scaling it up to $3-4 billion in coming years, said Shalabh Tandon, India lead, climate business & clean energy, IFC. IFC on Thursday announced an equity investment of $125 million in Hero Future Energies Private Ltd., a clean energy firm, for a minority stake. Tandon said that IFC does not invest in coal-based thermal power because of its commitment to climate change goals. Companies like Apple Inc., IKEA Group, Nokia Oyj, Infosys Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd are among those committed to becoming fully reliant on clean energy.The Economic Survey 2015-16 had suggested that the burden of subsidising poor consumers can shift from industrial consumers to rich individuals and that state electricity regulators should use income as a yardstick to fix the power tariff for individual consumers. The idea was to help businesses become more competitive. India has a target of putting in place 175 gigawatt (GW) of renewable power capacity by 2022, out of which 100 GW is to come from solar. At the moment, the country has about 8.7 GW of solar power capacity.One hurdle that companies face in going fully reliant on clean energy is that storage of energy is a costly proposition, which makes them rely on stable power from the grid for a significant part of their energy consumption when renewable energy is not available. Singhi of Dalmia Cements said that once power storage becomes a viable option, the company will be fully run on clean energy.",2017-01-06,hjuezPVDJdbEbipsCKavSN,The fall in solar power generation cost has now made it attractive for businesses to go for captive solar power plants,14:37,Cross-subsidy of power tariffs lure businesses to solar energy

				The impending entry of a new fourth-generation operator would anyway mean a trip to the slaughterhouse for a few of the dozen existing players, some of whom are already making a run for the coop door. But thats a known risk. Its the threat of having to cede market share to billionaire Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Jio faster than imagined thats causing nervousness.That latter possibility has been raised by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of Indias (Trai) consultation paper on scrapping the compensation one wireless service receives for calls routed to it by another.That proposal to do away with the calling-party-pays system, the incumbents allege, smacks of bias. It would give a pricing advantage to a new network like Jio, which would be more likely to originate calls than terminate them. Meanwhile, Jio has complained that existing operators are sabotaging its ongoing beta trials by not offering adequate interconnection, leading to call drops.Incumbents have denied the allegation, and accused Ambani of running a service in the garb of testing. The dispute is fast turning into just the kind of melee the government, looking to hold its biggest-ever auction of spectrum a little more than a month from now, can ill afford.Also Read: Reliance Jio vs the rest: Trai, PMO dragged into the fightTo the extent the fracas is the harbinger of a bruising price war, its also bad news for shareholders of Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular, which together with Vodafone control more than three-fifths of the market. The quest to expand data usage on their networks ahead of Jios long-delayed entry has already caused prices to head south:While data usage is indeed picking up, capital expenditure is accelerating. Ideas net debt is almost 5.7 times annual earnings before interest and taxes (Ebit); its 3.3 times Ebit for Bharti. With Reliance boasting to the regulator that its $20 billion investment in Jio is already more than any of its competitors, incumbents have little breathing room.When Kumar Mangalam Birla, Idea Cellulars controlling shareholder, sought to streamline his fiber-to-finance empire, minority shareholders balked at the prospect of being asked to fund his money-guzzling telecom venture. Ambani, on the other hand, has been lucky. His petroleum-refining business is minting cash, so creditors are giving him the chips to spin the roulette wheel and grab those 100 million Reliance Jio subscribers he craves.The stakes are high, and so are anxiety levels. With the regulator adding to the uncertainty about future market share, investors can expect more volatility. Idea Cellulars shares jumped as much as 7.9% on Tuesday before the company said media speculation about a sale to Vodafone is untrue and preposterous.The fluttering has begun.

Typically, we journalists dont carry a lot of cash in wallets (not that our bank accounts have much either).

				I thought of visiting the closest bank branch I could find in Bandra West. A sole Greater Bombay Cooperative Bank branch gave me some hope. I could see some people waiting for the bank to open so that they may feel rich again. As soon as the branch started its operations, I could see eager customers in the queue look spiffy, only to see the branch staff come out and tell them that they had not received any new currency notes and they did not have a ny new notes. The notes would only arrive after  4pm.  Six hours for a lousy Rs 500 currency note? Whats this, the iPhone 7? I muttered under my breath while angrily kicking the ground.Maybe the branch of a bigger bank might be a good idea, I thought to myself, carefully caressing the Rs500 note in my hand. I walked up to an Axis Bank branch nearby, only to find out that the staff had run out of Rs100 currency notes in the first couple of hours. The staff told all of us to come back by tomorrow to get the new Rs500 and Rs 2,000 currency notes. Maybe a public sector bank will be more amenable to my needs and ensure that I have enough liquidity to last the day before the automated teller machines (ATMs) start working from Friday. I got into an autorickshaw and asked the driver to drop me at a bank branch. Any bank branch would do, I said to myself. An Allahabad Bank branch on Pali Hill Road was the closest we could find. So I walked up to the gate, which was teeming with people at the door. Apparently they wanted my original identity proof and self-attested photocopy to ensure that my money is converted into an acceptable currency over which I shall have ownership rights again. However, I quickly moved to the neighbouring private bank ICICI Bank, thinking the documentation system would be much easier. ICICI Bank, I thought, would have a more streamlined process where the authorities wouldnt want me to give them a hundred different documents. Of course, I forgot that this withdrawal of currency was a government initiative, so every possible box for paperwork has been ticked.Besides, I had lost my old wallet only recently and all of my original government identity proofs were gone though I had the photo copies of them. The Rs500 note in my wallet was staring back at me with disdain, even as I tried to look for a way to get rid of it.The staff at the ICICI Bank branch was considerate enough to come and tell me that there was no rush to come and convert my money to the new currency on Thursday. And, I could come back anytime later in the week. Of course, I didnt tell her about my lost identity proofs, but it felt good that these options were readily available for some more time.

-0.05,"Bengaluru: It has been a little over 15 months since R. Seshasayee became the non-executive chairman of Infosys Ltd. His term coincides with a very interesting time for the company, which is trying to regain its tag as the bellwether of the Indian IT industry under its first non-founder chief executive, Vishal Sikka.
				   
				In an interview, Seshasayee explained his equation with Sikka, the changing role of the board, the challenges it faces, its relationship with the company founders, what he likes about Sikkas leadership style and why it is wrong to say that Infosys has twin power structures. Edited excerpts:Is Infosys in a better shape now than when you started in this role?Firstly, the change at the leadership level, to have someone like Vishal (Sikka) come (in), has (given) a very clear strategic direction to the company, given the changing landscape in the industry. That is a very big step forward.From the boards perspective, it is very important to have the right leader, and I believe we have the right leader. From the boards perspective, it is important that the leader articulates the strategy (and) the board is aligned to this strategy. I can categorically say that the board is fully aligned to this strategy Vishal has sketched.I and the board feel extremely good that this strategic change in direction to meet the new demands in the business landscape has gone down very well. To communicate this kind of a change in an organization that is as large as Infosys is not easy.Now, of course we have the execution challenges. And those are things which we will learn as we go along. We have had a few bumps. We have had some quick learning. I think, by and large, the strategy is getting executed with the right speed and in the right direction. What is the boards role in designing this strategy?Ideally, the board should pick the right leader for the company and the leader should articulate the strategy. The board has an active role to play for sure in understanding the strategic proposal, challenging that, and getting an alignment between the management and the board. The board cannot stand aside and say that all this is strategic direction and not our problem. The board has to be fully engaged in (the) formulation of strategy.We have had in the last couple of years a pretty deep level of engagement. The board does not meet only for board meetings for approving what is put on the table. So the engagement has been continuous. It has not been even that it takes place (just) once a quarter.The second is that I also think that it is important to think for the board to be learning. Learning is an important DNA of Infosys. Learning does not just apply to executives, the rank and file of management. It equally applies to members of the board. We have had systematic immersion sessions. And our intent is to intensify these sessions. Intent is to make sure that we are not merely sitting and listening in these sessions.This is a journey. It is never-ending. But I do think both these continuous engagement and continuous learning are making it possible to have a very constructive dialogue with the leadership. What are the big challenges faced by the board?I cannot think of a company of this size which has gone through transformation simultaneously on three fronts. The first is the business transformation. All IT firms are going through this, simply because (their) clients are going through this transformation. That is one massive transformation. That is pervasive and happening all across.The second is the move from (being) an iconic promoter-led organization to an organization that is professionally managed at the management and board level. I was actually looking at how many top 100 companies in India have entirely professional board and professional management. If you leave aside the banks and the public sector undertakings, perhaps Infosys is the only company. From a governance construct, this is a very unique and desirable construct, one which would be the ideal construct. But this transformation from a promoter-managed organization to a professional-managed organization both happening at the same time, is a huge transformation. Actually the average tenure of the board, if I leave aside Jeff (Professor Jeffrey Lehman), is two-and-a-half years. So you have a completely new set of people.And so, to be able to navigate this huge company in the right direction, from the point of view of both strategic (issues) and governance, that requires a great deal of work, and a great deal of rescripting of the playbook.We have had challenges in the first quarter. We have had some challenges (with) a couple of good leaders, whom we would have liked to retain, not being there. We have had some challenges regarding the perception issue into governance. I dont think these are real issues but perception issues. But we have very quickly learnt and we are putting in very quickly in place the right kind of solutions. That is the second kind of transformation which we are scripting very well.And then there is the third kind of transformation which is the cultural transformation. From a company that had been pretty much India-centric, we are truly now global-minded. This is a cultural shift. So, in some sense, we need to reset the needle. Each of these transformations is itself a challenge. It may not be apparent to someone on the outside. There is some criticism that Infosyss board does not have enough people with a technology background. Im hearing this for the first time that we do not have enough people from tech background on the board. We have Vishal and (chief operating officer) Pravin (Rao).Beyond Vishal and Pravin?Let me explain the diversity we have on the board. We have Ravi (Venkatesan), who has spent years in technology at Microsoft. Of course, we have Roopa (Kudva) and Punita (Kumar-Sinha). Look at their background. They have not been only in one industry. Roopa has spent a lifetime at a variety of industries, evaluating, assessing, rating a variety of industries. And so has Punita. We have people dealing with different firms, including technology firms. Then we have people like Jeff and John (Etchemendy) who bring the academic discipline to it. Kiran (Mazumdar-Shaw) is a very entrepreneurial person. We have a very good diverse group of people. Having said that, we are constantly on the lookout for the right kind of talent. We are pretty much looking at every possible skill where we think we have a gap and which we think we need to bring in. So we are looking at people. So that is a continuous process. We have people on the board who can read the future, have good understanding of technology trends, are able to challenge the strategic direction. We do take external inputs where we need. So those people dont have to be on the board.So could you perhaps expand the board?We are on the lookout, and we have some candidates in mind and we will do it at the right time.Help us understand the boards relationship with the company founders.So this iconic institution has been created by an iconic leader (N.R. Narayana) Murthy and his wonderful team. This is an outstanding or exceptional kind of history where Murthy and team decided to step down or step away. I must tell you categorically that while I have personally a lot of communication happening with Murthy, not once even by accident have the promoters asked for information which is not available to the public. That must be said to the credit of the promoters that they have not sought any information which would give them any preferential access to any information.We talk about many things. We talk about perceptions that you might have from what is available in the public domain, about the kind of strategic direction. And I take his advice very seriously. But that said, the board has the responsibility to do what is right for the institution. The board is closest to the facts and the situation on the ground.And therefore, information and facts, which are available to the board must drive the board in the right direction, and that decision will be of the board only. Do you think the founders could have expressed their unhappiness with certain board decisions such as Sikkas compensation or Kumar-Sinhas appointment differently?This is a question that should not be asked to me, since this is what the promoters chose to do; so it will not be fair for me to respond. From the boards perspective, we have advice coming from many other investors and not just the promoters. If you believe we do not have discussions with any other investors, you are wrong. The conversations we have with the promoters are no different than those we have with other investors. So it is not right for me to be second-guessing on what they should do. Were you a little saddened by the way they expressed their displeasure?This is a free world and everybody has their own viewpoint. So, do I get saddened by the percentage of negative votes on anything? No. I have a job to do, and we have some 99 percentage in favour and that is a resounding endorsement of the boards recommendation. We should just move on. What issues do you seek their advice on? There are many issues on which I seek advice from many people. So why would you want to only look at what Im seeking from Mr Murthy. Murthy has been a friend for 30 years. We have worked together on boards. We were together on the board of ICICI, we have worked together on many other forums. So he is one person I respect, like other people. So I dont see anything unusual in that. There is this perception that there are twin power centres at Infosys: Murthy and Sikka.First, there is no such twin power centres. That is completely wrong, and that will be very unfair to the promoters. Because, like I mentioned, Murthy has been an exceptional leader who has chosen to stay away and only give advice when sought from. So it will be utterly wrong. Now, the second thing is that when you say there is this perception. Now I dont want to deal with perceptions. We must deal with reality. Im dealing with reality. The reality is that what I have clearly said.What are the issues on which Sikka seeks your advice?Because of the fact that we have a very unique construct, the engagement of the board (with Sikka) has been continuous. My engagement with Vishal has been more intense than the rest of the board. I think we speak almost every week, sometimes multiple times a week. We discuss different issues, say related to people, organization, performance, relating to issues on strategy, customers. We discuss also spirituality and philosophy on weekends. We have an excellent rapport and relationship. We have a lot of common interests. Last night, we were talking on pure sciences. So, the foundation of the relationship is one of complete mutual trust, and complete transparent sharing of information and views. So there are many things that we do.How is the board helping Sikka in this transformation? Its a two-way constructive process. Its not on the basis of a paper that is put on the table. The way it is being done is through continuous, comprehensive and concerted engagement.What is the toughest issue you have advised him on so far?The toughest discussions we have had are on philosophy.Is Vishals compensation of $11 million a year linked to Infosys clocking $20 billion by March 2021?The compensation is linked to targets which are publically given. There is a trajectory for this. The compensation is linked to that trajectory. This is something which the board and Vishal have discussed and agreed.Can you help us understand the weightage of the three specific targets (total revenue, revenue per employee, operating margin) on Sikkas variable pay?There is probably no other Indian company which has so clearly linked pay to targets which have been made public. To my mind, this is the most transparent way of getting shareholders approval. In the trajectory, we have to take into account many things. We need to take into account the industry dynamics, the company dynamics, the people dynamics, all of that. Thats something which the board is charged with the responsibility to do and we will do so.Can you give us some details about the trajectory itself?Can you tell me another company that has been giving the targets for the compensation of the chief executive? There is good reason why no other company does this. It is not because this is inconvenient or anything. It is because, as I said, its a very dynamic situation. Every month, we see changes in the landscape. Every month, we see new challenges. The board is a delegated authority of the shareholders to run this company. It is therefore in the fitness of things that the board does the job that has been entrusted by the shareholders. It doesnt kick back to the shareholders the job that has been entrusted. We have gone one step further to say, yes this long-term goal is what we believe must be the reference point for the compensation.So is it more aspirational in nature?No, I have said that there is nothing aspirational in this. This is a target which the company is looking at, is pursuing. Now nothing is cast in stone. But this is, at the moment, the target that we have.Are you saying that the growth of the industry will also be taken into account?The growth of the industry is pretty much the playfield, right? So we have got to look at the growth of the industry in the context of assessment.(For any company,) the target is fixed for the annual budget in the context of what you see is the market situation. Technology changes, all of it are taken into account. A five-year goal is fixed on what you believe is the kind of the trajectory in this. We have to keep constantly calibrating both the environment and the industry. As of now, we are not changing those targets (for Infosys).Can they be changed?Thats a speculative question. Why did the board change its original plan on the promised payment to former chief financial officer Rajiv Bansal?All I can say is I have already made the statement suo motu in the AGM (annual general meeting). You wrote this article (referring to Mints story in May on Bansals unusually high severance pay). Because you wrote this article, I thought it is important and it is our responsibility to make sure that we address this issue. So the issue was not raised in the AGM, but I made a suo motu statement saying that we believe that there is no impropriety.There is a severance agreement. There are rights of the parties in the contract. And the contract will be administrated in line with the rights of the parties. Period. That is all. So has there been any change in the agreement?That is not something you need to be looking at all. I am only saying there is a contract, (there are) the rights of the parties in the contract and the contract will be administered in line with the contractual rights of the parties. Period.So is it fair to assume that you could rework it if one of the parties did not abide by its terms?This is an entirely legal issue. All I need to say is that there are no other extraneous considerations for this, for the administration of this. It will be driven by the contractual rights. Has anything happened within the realms of that contract that could lead to a change in it?No matter where you are coming from, the only two things which are relevant to the public and relevant to everybody else (are): Is this an issue where there is impropriety? I have said no, repeatedly no, and I stand by that.Is this contract getting changed or cancelled for any other extraneous considerations? I am going a step further to say: The contract will be administered based on the rights of the parties in the contract. Period.How do you like Sikkas leadership style?We have the right kind of leader in Vishal. His understanding of the changes, his insight into the changes is outstanding. Vishals articulation of a solution, even in the context of the auto industry for example or the banking industry, is absolutely on the dot. We have a very good leader who understands client requirements and his client connect is exceptional. His strategic direction is exceptional. He has been a phenomenal person to motivate a very, very large crowd. Its not easy for a new person to step in and have this kind of influence. We certainly have an exceptional leader.How has the boards role at a company changed?The role of a board has changed phenomenally, and for the good. It is no longer this friends club that you had in the past and people coming to have a cup of coffee and go back. This is the trusteeship concept. That is getting to be far better understood now by enlightened boards, and therefore, the responsibility that comes with that. In the process, the engagement is getting to be much more. Increasingly, I find that the board meeting is just one punctuation mark in that engagement. It also brings in the need for a greater amount of understanding of the business and the independence to challenge.

				Voice revenues grew 3.8% and 4.6% year-on-year, respectively, for Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd, and declined by 0.9% for Vodafone India Ltd.But worse still, growth in data revenue decelerated further. As the chart alongside shows, growth in data revenue fell to 35% and 27%, respectively, for Bharti and Idea, from as high as 70-80% just a year ago.In fact, in the June quarter, Idea and Vodafone slowed investments on their networks considerably, which is perhaps an indication that the data opportunity is not as big as was earlier thought.Idea added close to 6,500 3G + 4G sites (in Q1), compared with 17,000 in the previous quarter. Vodafones site additions also slowed to 6,000 3G + 4G sites as compared with 15,000 in Q4. Ideas and Vodafones lower rollout numbers are largely a reflection of the relatively limited spectrum portfolio, especially in 4G. However, it might also be an indication of their view on the market, where both companies have been relatively conservative, compared with Bharti, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities wrote in a note to clients.Ideas voice volumes and revenue grew at a sedate pace as the company attempted to curb promotions. Since the move has backfired, it can be expected to be flexible with pricing to drive growth from Q2 onwards.In any case, industry dynamics have changed considerably since Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd launched operations in September. While data tariffs were anyway expected to be under pressure, Jio has also targeted the voice segment by offering unlimited voice calls at fairly low tariffs.The full impact of the Jio launch on average realizations and the growth metrics of incumbents will be visible only next year; but, its likely that some impact of additional promotions may be visible this year itself, especially in the December quarter.",2016-10-09,iVwWBc2fFY7BUcqAzKzMXP,"Growth in data revenue fell to 35% and 27%, respectively, for Bharti and Idea, from as high as 70-80% just a year ago",23:12,Telecom: slowing data growth a worry for industry

His regular ENT (ear, nose and throat) specialist had gone abroad for a medical conference and he didnt know of any other in his neighbourhood. He surfed the web for help and discovered, to his momentary relief, that he could fix an appointment online with a specialist at one of the hospitals not far from where he lived.
				   
				Hospitals, especially in India, have for long cut a sorry figure in terms of their digital savvy and use of information technology (IT) to be on par with their counterparts in sectors such as banking and telecom.According to Tirupathi Karthik, CEO of Napier Healthcare, a Singapore-based provider of software solutions to the healthcare industry, As compared to a global average of 22.5% of income spent on IT by healthcare providers, or even 6-15% being invested in IT in other sectors within India, anecdotal data from multiple sources indicate that healthcare providers in India rarely spend more than 0.5% of their annual revenue on information technology.  But things have been changing for some time, albeit at a pace slower than many would want. Leading the change are large hospital chains such as Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd, Max Healthcare Institute Ltd and Fortis Healthcare Ltd.Prodded on by the need to take control of their sprawling operationswhich span dozens of hospitals in multiple citieson the one hand, and the rising expectations of tech-empowered consumers on the other, these modern hospitals are setting the template for healthcare in India.High time they did so. If you looked at the hospitals in India around 10 years back, they were very basic in terms of tech infrastructure. Besides, independent doctors got what they pretty much wanted. This led to lack of control with the management and poor visibility into the entire treatment and costs hospitals had to bear, says Varun Gera, founder and chief executive of HealthAssure Pvt. Ltd, a primary  healthcare aggregator that has partnered with almost 2,300 clinics, including diagnostic labs and hospital OPDs (out-patient departments). He says that somewhere along the line hospitals had to work as hospitals and it could no longer be the case of doctors having their own way of doing things. While part of this doctors-management clash had to do with egos, a more significant role was played by ITthe lack of it in the early days and increasing enablement as time went on. It is the clinical protocols, organisation-wide processes and use of IT tools through which hospitals, particularly those with a corporate road map to grow fast, could gain better control, get visibility into how treatment is given, and embrace more standardization for better healthcare outcomes across their chain of facilities.Once processes and IT tools began to be adopted, hospitals moved on from using basic networking and hospital information systems (HIS) to looking at electronic medical records (EMRs) and other advanced deployments for improving efficiency as well as patient care.According to research firm Gartner Inc., Indian healthcare providers are set to spend $1.2 billion on IT products and services in 2016, including telecom services.  Among the key areas in which hospitals are increasingly focusing their IT efforts are online doctor appointments, data capture of patients visiting the hospitals and applying analytics tools to get insights into their operations.One of the large hospital chains investing big time in IT is Apollo. One of the things we have done is enabled online appointment for doctors. Earlier, less than 10% of our patients came by appointment. Now at Apollo almost 50% of patients are coming by appointment, says Sangita Reddy, joint managing director, Apollo Hospitals.That is a huge change in terms of avoiding the chaos resulting from a lot of patients just landing up at its hospitals all over India. It also allows Apollo to focus on the more important task of clinical care rather than manage hordes of patients shuffling from one department to the other on its premises.More significant change is afoot through the use of data analytics for both clinical and non-clinical insights. We are collecting about 55% of all our patients clinical data electronically, which is enabling us to create a digital warehouse. This digital warehouse, in turn, is enabling us to do data mining and use this data in different ways, says Reddy.These efforts are helping Apollo in workflow prediction, staffing, communication, etc., and helping the organization turn into a data-driven enterprise.One of the key areas in which analytics is being applied at Apollo, according to Reddy, is the use of predictive analytics for clinical purposes. We have pioneered the concept of personalized health check-ups in India: instead of a common check-up, it is customized based on analytics of data of almost 1 million patients that have visited our hospitals over the years, she says. The decision tree for providing healthcare is being evolved based on scenario building through matching a particular medicine with a particular disease or condition that previous patients had encountered. The result is quicker treatment with improved outcomes.The analytics tool enhances the effectiveness of the medication that doctors choose, says Reddy.On the question of the acceptance of such tools by the medical fraternity, she says, We use these predictive analytics tools in a recommendatory manner, so its not forced on the doctorsand we have found a very high degree of acceptance. Currently being used in its large hospitals, Apollo will soon extend its use to other hospitals as well.There is a lot of scope for improvement in the way hospitals in India operate and use IT to manage operations and deliver healthcare in a seamless manner taking into account the intricacies involved in settling health insurance claims. According to Gera, The whole focus now is on getting the data out and efficiency of operations. The way hospitals operate currently is much fractured, as there are multiple complexities involved in their operations.And while technology cannot do everything for hospitals, the right tools and processes can make a big difference to the quality and speed of healthcare delivery in India.Among the tools for improving or aiding clinical outcomes, International Business Machines Corp.s Watson cognitive computing solutions for healthcare are being considered by many hospitals in India. One of the first to implement it is Manipal Hospital Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. According to IBM, Watson for Oncology is now in use by oncologists at six locations in the Manipal Hospitals network to provide information and insights to physicians to help them identify personalised, evidence-based cancer care options across India.If the past decade signified the modernisation of hospitals in terms of physical infrastructure, medical equipment and the like, the next one is likely to be defined by integration of multiple IT tools, advanced analytics solutions, health monitoring devices and Internet of Thingsunder which medical devices, computer systems, smartphones and diagnostic equipment will share data with each other in real time for individualised, improved healthcare.",2016-11-04,iX1AMyGsjOevaUwtoZVn4N,"Hospitals have for long cut a sorry figure in terms of digital savvy and the use of information technology.

0.54,"Bangalore/Mumbai: Amid the carnage on Wall Street in 2008, as Bank of America Corp. was trying to forge its rushed merger with Merrill Lynch & Co., Natarajan Chandrasekaran boarded a plane for New York to try to reassure the two financial behemoths that an Indian IT company could make the systems of their strikingly different cultures work together.
				   
				Chandrasekaran, known as Chandra, was then chief operating officer of Asias largest IT services exporter, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS). Over the following weeks he fended off global rivals who smelled an opportunity to muscle in, and set about integrating the banks systems and assuaging the new managements anxieties about outsourcing to a foreign supplier. TCS kept the business and grew it substantially.Last week, Chandra, now chief executive officer of TCS, was chosen for an even more fraught diplomatic task: to resurrect the image and fortunes of the Tata Group, Indias biggest conglomerate, which has been racked by losses at some of its biggest units, and by a boardroom battle that has threatened to turn the workings of the venerable corporation into a media soap-opera.Tata Sons, the group holding company, named Chandra, 53, as chairman, taking over on 21 February from interim chairman Ratan Tata. Tata, 79, had run the family business for more than two decades before handing over in 2012 to his hand-picked successor, Cyrus Mistry. In October, Tata Sons shocked Indias corporate community by firing Mistry, reinstalling Ratan Tata and promising to find a replacement by March. Chandra was a front runner for the job, a Tata employee almost all his working life, who grew TCS into the conglomerates most successful business, with about $16 billion in sales.Yet he is both an insider and an outsider. While he has been with the group since joining as an intern three decades ago, he is the first chairman who is not a Parsi, the shrinking ethnic group of Zoroastrians that boasts a disproportionately high number of Indias business elite. He is only the third person without the Tata name to get the job, and the first without a close family tie to the Tatas.IT CareerMoreover, his career and success has all been with TCS, virtually an island within the group that serves many of the worlds top corporations with a young, skilled, technical workforce. As head of Tata Sons, he will be responsible for a conglomerate that assembles buses in Zambia, serves prawn kalimiri to diners at its Bombay Brasserie in London, sells salt to Indian families at Rs18(27 cents) a kilo, and runs hundreds of other businesses across the world.He served both TCS and the customer commendably during the BofA-ML merger. Now he has the chance to build a positive organization by bonding together various companies and their half-a-million plus employees, said S. Ramadorai, the previous CEO of TCS. He is non-confrontational and, at the same time, does not foolishly ignore problems.Chandras appointment came after TCS announced it had made the equivalent of $1 billion in quarterly profit for the first time. Tatas star unit accounts for over half of the groups market value.A five-man panel unanimously chose Chandra from a list of more than a dozen candidates. He stood out both within the group and outside, said former bureaucrat Vijay Singh, a non-executive director on the board of Tata Sons, which ratified the selection. A Tata Sons statement said Chandra would uphold the groups values and adhere to its high standard of practicesthings the board previously accused Mistry of failing to do.We are at an inflection point, said Chandra in a statement after his appointment. I am aware that this role comes with huge responsibilities. It will be my endeavor to help progress the group with the ethos, ethics and values that the Tata group has been built on. Chandra declined an interview request for this story.Steel lossesFacing him is a menu of corporate issues, including the money-losing UK operations of Tata Steel Ltd., the overhang from failed ambitions like Tata Motors Ltd.s cheap Nano car, debt-ridden Indian Hotels Co., and a $1.17 billion arbitration battle with telecom partner NTT Docomo Inc. Mistry has previously defended his time as chairman, when he tried to reduce debt built up during a series of global acquisitions by Ratan Tata. In an e-mail to directors after his dismissal, Mistry said the group may face Rs1.18 trillion in writedowns over time because of  legacy hotspots he inherited.Mistry, whose family owns an 18% stake in Tata Sons, filed a case with the National Company Law Tribunal seeking the appointment of an administrator to oversee the companys affairs, a forensic audit and a probe into the role of the trustees of Tata trusts, the majority shareholders of Tata Sons. Hes asked for Ratan Tata, head of the trusts, to be restrained from attending board meetings. A spokesman for Mistry said he would not comment as the matter is subject to the legal proceedings.Investors expect Chandra to act quickly to resolve governance issues, said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director at proxy advisory firm InGovern Research Services Pvt. Key to his success will be how he handles Ratan Tata, who has indicated that he may step down as chairman of the trusts this year. Tata instigated the Nano project, a troubled airline venture and many of the other expansions that are now draining the groups resources.Tata congratulated Chandra on Twitter, saying he was sure the new chairman would protect the groups values and ethics. A Tata Group spokesman declined to comment.Chandra is an optimist, he thinks big and will go after positive outcomes in the new job, said Krishnakumar N., executive chairman of rival Indian IT services company Mindtree Ltd.The son of a farmer in rural southern India, Chandra studied in a Tamil-language school rather than gaining the English-language education favored by the middle class.He joined TCS in 1987 after completing a masters in Computer Applications from Regional Engineering College, Trichy, Tamil Nadu. His leadership talent was spotted by Ramadorai in 1993 when Chandra was praised by customer International Business Machines Corp. He was put in charge of a major project for British Telecommunications Plc. When Ramadorai became TCSs CEO, he chose Chandra as his executive assistant.He loved meeting customers, and it was never a Hi-How-Are-You? kind of a meeting, Ramadorai said in a telephone interview. He put the client at the center of the universe, made every conversation count and nurtured clients like American Express.Young CEOChandra took over as chief executive of TCS in 2009 at the age of 46. Over the next seven years, he would triple the IT companys share price and revenue and more than double its headcount.As Chandras corporate universe expanded, so did his interests, according to colleagues. Hes fond of photography and classical music, but his real passion is running. He has run marathons in Boston, Chicago, Berlin, New York, Tokyo and other cities.Being a runner has greatly shaped my thinking as a leader, Chandra told Runners World in October 2015. You have to decide on the length of the engagement, develop endurance to handle setbacks and increase speed when the competition demands it. You have to perform with your heart and your mind.At TCS, Chandra backed new technologies from cloud to mobile and evangelized to global corporations about digital disruption, always with a reputation for building close relationships with clients. Som Mittal, former head of Hewlett-Packard Co.s India operations, worked with Chandra for years in the software-industry trade body Nasscom and said if he texted Chandra, hed get a call back within 20 minutes.Whether he was preparing for a marathon in London or stepping into a client meeting in New York, he unfailingly called back, no matter what timezone and which corner of the globe he was in, said Mittal. He was also an inveterate traveler who would fly to client meetings even for the smallest deals. He has this uncanny ability of making everyone think they are his dearest friends.Chandra drove projects at TCS that dispersed the chaotic crowds and touts that used to clog the entrances of Indias passport offices and its best-known hospital, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi. He charted new territories for TCS in Latin America and Japan by hiring local talent.His new role comes with a different set of challenges. He will have to stabilize the group and plan a decade or two into the groups future, said Ramadorai. It is a rough road.Looming over him will be the presence of a family that has been royalty in Indias business world for more than a century, and the scion of that family, Ratan Tata.Chandra is not afraid to express opinion and can be extremely firm when he is convinced about something, said Mittal. He is no pushover. Bloomberg",2017-01-16,icSPfNFcGFeEX4LWRyqbnM,Natarajan Chandrasekaran  will take over as chairman of Tata Sons from interim chief Ratan Tata on 21 February ,12:30,N.

0.25,"On 15 January, at least 42,000 runners lined up at the starting point of the Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon, the largest road-run event in Asia. Jaspal Bindra, who came up with the idea in 2004, was nowhere to be seen. In 2016 too, he was not around. 
				   
				Bindra, the banks chief executive officer (CEO) for Asia and group executive director till early 2015, had not missed a single Mumbai Marathon till 2016. He had been living in Hong Kong from 2008 but would fly down for the eventalways held on the third Sunday in Januaryand cheer the runners. A few days ahead of the Mumbai Marathon, Bindra, 56, is a few minutes late for our luncheon meeting  at the NRI (Not Really Indian) restaurant at the Bandra-Kurla Complex in Mumbai. To avoid the hassle of choosing individual dishes, we opt for Jugal Bandi, a meal for two, accompanied by a glass of Chandon Brut each. The starters are South African peri peri wings, BBQ prawns and a Burmese green tea salad; this year-old restaurant serves Indian-inflected cuisine from around the world. As always, Bindra is dressed immaculately, in a white shirt and sky-blue turban. Some 15 years ago, over dinner at a different restaurant in south Mumbaihe was then regional general manager, India, and CEO of Standard Chartered BankBindra, digging into his chicken satay and prawn tempura, had commented, As long as I have an active sex life, I dont need to play golf. Those were not Twitter days, so it did not get wide publicity, but the banking community took note. He was perceived to be aggressive, someone who calls a spade a spade.During his two-year tenure as head of corporate and institutional banking at StanChart (1998-2000) and later as the head of both StanChart and ANZ Grindlays (he oversaw the merger of the two), Bindra showed 3,200 employees the doornearly 50% of the employee strength then.By a twist of fate, he himself had to quit the bank where he was one of the top five executives. Did he feel insecure after the StanChart board, under pressure from shareholders, asked CEO Peter Sands to leave? Bindras answer is quite logical. He was one of the top four executives of the bank reporting to Sands. The others were Mike Rees (overseeing the wholesale and retail assets), Andy Halford (group chief financial officer) and V. Shankar (another banker of Indian origin, in charge of Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Americas). Had the new CEO come from within the bank, I would have got a different responsibility. But since Sands successor came from outside, all four of us would have continued to do the same job. At mid-50s, I was looking for a different responsibility, he says. Was he eyeing the top job? Well, maybe not at that point of time but yes, if I had stuck around, I would have liked the challenge, Bindra says, nibbling on the spicy wings.He was the first to leave after Sands. By end-February 2015, he had put in his papers. Shankar and Rees followed him. Did he get a ton of money as a severance package? The standard practice in the bank is one years remuneration when a board-level executive quits. And he was not allowed to take up any job in the financial sector for a year after resigning.I cannot resist the temptation of asking how StanChart got into a situation in India where its bad assets ballooned and profits plunged. India, which accounts for anything from 15-20% of the banks global profits, and is probably the second-most important market along with Singapore, after Hong Kong, has gone through a real bad patch in the past few years. Was the local management (which was reporting to Bindra) reckless? Was it greed for balance-sheet growth that got the bank into trouble?Bindra says the bank actually weathered the collapse of Lehman Brothers well and continued to show growth in profit until 2012. Thereafter, it suffered on account of a severe structural shrinkage in commodity prices. What he means is that the companies to which the bank had exposure were in the commodity space and once they suffered, their ability to service bank loans was dented.Why did StanChart take such large exposures to so many companies in India which have in any case been over-leveraged, laden with loans they couldnt repay? Bindra says this assumption is not entirely correct. Our internal norms do not allow the bank to take more than 50% exposure in any loan. This means that even if it gives, say, a $1 billion loan to a particular company, it sells down 50-75% of it to other lenders within 90 days of disbursing the loan. So, we were as affected as others. It is not fair to say only StanChart accumulated bad assets.As the main course arrivesSri Lankan Potli Murg and dal makhani with tandoori roti and riceI decide to shift my focus to the present. Like quite a few other global Indian bankers, he is back in the country to do something on his own. Is it the proverbial return of the prodigal son? Also, what made him pick up a stake in Centrum Capital Ltd, a non-banking finance company (NBFC), and become an entrepreneur?I was 55 when I was leaving StanChart. I had three choices before meI could have got a similar job overseas and probably run a smaller bank as CEO; partially retire and join a few boards of companies and offer advisory services; or become an entrepreneur. And if I were to be an entrepreneur, it had to be in India, he says. Where else can you grow business in the banking and finance space? The public sector banks are losing their market share, foreign banks are shrinking business by design.... This is the best time to be in India. I could not afford to miss this window, Bindra says.Last April, he reportedly picked up close to a 20% stake in Centrum, started in 1995 by Bindras long-time friend Chandir Gidwani and Khushrooh Byramjee at the Bombay Mutual Building in Fort. It is a financial services firm with a presence in corporate finance, foreign exchange, wealth management, institutional broking and investment banking. It manages around Rs10,000- crore assets in its wealth management portfolio but does not have a balance sheet as such, for it does not give loans. Bindra is adding that piece to Centrum. He has started giving loans ranging from Rs5-20 crore to small and medium-size entrepreneurs. Not too many banks dabble in this segment where financing is based primarily on cash flows, not balance sheets. He has already built a portfolio of Rs400 crore in this business. Another new business is small and affordable housing finance in the range of Rs10-25 lakh. Again, there is a huge opportunity with the governments big push for affordable housing and drop in the cost of money. The third new fund-based business is private equity. We need to compete with some of the private banks and a few other NBFCs, not the entire banking system, Bindra says.When he picked up the stake in Centrum, the market value of the NBFC was Rs450 crore. Now it has crossed Rs1,500 crore. I assume that at Rs450 crore market value, for a 20% stake, he would have put in Rs90 crore. But Bindra says that may not be the correct figure as he has picked up a stake in the holding company, not the listed entity. Now all three partnersGidwani, Byramjee and Bindrahold equal stakes of around 20% each in the listed entity.After graduating from XLRI, a management school in Jamshedpur, Bindra joined Bank of America, where he spent 10 years. He spent another five at the Union Bank of Switzerland as head of business development in India before shifting to StanChart in August 1998, where he remained for 17 years. Brought up in Kolkata and many district towns in West Bengal (his father was a police officer), Bindras Bengal connection is still alive. His wife is from Asansol, and he visits his in-laws often. He can speak fluent Bengali but has not developed a sweet tooth. So, while I choose butterscotch ice cream for dessert, he orders coffee.The last round of conversation predictably revolves around demonetization. He joins the discussion a bit diplomatically. He agrees that digital banking in the unorganized sector is not easy but says that once we go cashless, the cost of operations will definitely come down and size will become less relevant for NBFCs. Currently, Centrum employs 2,000 people; for the foreign exchange business, its biggest earner, it has a presence at 19 airports and 100 outlets spread over 45 cities. Money is not a problem. There are plenty of funds available both as debt and equity. My challenge is to grow and build a solid track record and be in the reckoning to set up a bank. If available, we can buy a bank too, he says. All these, if at all, will happen after 2020. Till then, he wants to build a solid NBFC which can compete with private banks effectively.Like the Mumbai Marathon, StanCharts Indian Depository Receipts, or IDR, was also Bindras baby. He agrees with me that it was a flop. There have been issues such as tax and the class of investors who could buy IDRs. The insurance firms were never allowed to buy.... It was an experiment that failed, he says. StanChart remains the first and only foreign company to launch an IDR. But all that is behind him. I remind him of his life-size bronze statue on the eighth floor of Standard Chartered Bank Plcs old headquarters at Londons 1, Aldermanbury Squarea unique initiative of the bank to showcase the diversity of its employee base. In June 2013, the headquarters were shifted to 1, Basinghall Avenue in London. Does the new office still have his statue? He shrugs his shoulders. Bindra doesnt really care much for such things now.That day, the Centrum stock hit its lifetime high of Rs34.50. In 2016, when Bindra took over as the executive chairman and a promoter, it was trading at around Rs10.His favourite memory: Carrying the Olympic-flame torch for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.One assignment he loved: Global head of diversity and inclusion at StanChart, 2005-13.His hobby: Watching films, travelling with his wife.Favourite place on earth: Asansol, where his in-laws live (to keep his marriage alive!).One thing he would like to forget: the StanChart IDR; it was ahead of its time.One achievement he is proud of: the Mumbai Marathon.One bit of media coverage that he cherishes: Being featured in  Time magazine in 2010.",2017-01-27,ivDxiaKv9AlNq4jlbx7hyN,"Standard Chartereds man for India till early 2015, Bindra is back  now as an entrepreneur",15:32,Jaspal Bindra: Return of the prodigal son
-0.24,"The strings attached to the governments relief measures for sugar mills are becoming visible. On Wednesday, shares of sugar mills fell after news that the government may impose stock limits. This is a regressive step, moving away from decontrol, but is not a surprise altogether.
				   
				Stock limits will mean sugar in excess of the limits will be sold, leading to more supply and lower prices. The governments concern must be rising sugar prices. But they have been rising since end-September, so why the late reaction? The increase in recent months has been rapid. Since end-January, wholesale sugar prices are up by as much as 17%, while they are up by 39% since end-September. Globally, sugar prices have risen because of bad weather affecting the sugar cane crop in major producing countries such as India, Brazil and Thailand.That stress is visible in Indias output. Sugar production as of 15 April is down by 8% at 24.3 million tonnes (mt) from a year ago, says the Indian Sugar Mills Association (Isma). Whether Ismas estimate of 26 mt will be met remains to be seen, as only 117 mills are operating as of 15 April, compared with 245 a year ago. Prices may keep rising, as this situation unfolds.So what? Prices rise and fall in a free market, sugar is a decontrolled sector, and prices had been lying low for years. Why deny mills a year or two of good profit growth in a cyclical industry?The government may think it has the moral right to keep prices in check. Sugar mills in India have wrung concessions from the government, in return for paying a higher price for sugar cane. Although the Rangarajan committee has advocated linking sugar cane purchase price to the price of sugar and by-products, major sugar producing states such as Uttar Pradesh have not implemented it.Mills in Uttar Pradesh are forced to pay a state-determined price. In turn, they delay payments to farmers, leading to huge arrears, resulting in a confrontation between mills and state governments. Over the past few years, the Uttar Pradesh government has given some concessions to mills.The central government too has taken a number of measures for the sector. These include levying higher import duties on sugar, making it mandatory for oil marketing companies to procure ethanol (including fixing the purchase price), soft loans and an excise duty exemption on ethanol.The idea was to give some financial support to sugar mills, and the government even looked the other way as sugar prices rose. The government asked sugar mills to export 4 mt of sugar by September 2016. The money realized was to be used to cut down cane arrears and limit domestic supply. However, exports have been below targeted levels as domestic prices were higher. That is unlikely to have gone down well with the government. Rising sugar prices are a bigger pain. People will complain, state elections are under way and it could push up inflation as well. Maybe, the government is only sounding a warning and does not actually intend to impose stock limits. If sugar prices cool down, it may hold back. Otherwise, stock limits are just one weapon in its arsenal.In the past, the government has come down heavily on rising sugar prices. It can do so again. Government controls are a risk in sugar shares that investors have to now watch for.",2016-04-21,jcq2OsJyRPf1mVb9UYGirO,"The government has come down heavily on rising sugar prices in the past and it can do so again, a risk in sugar shares that investors have to now watch for

0.98,"New Delhi/Mumbai: Finance minister Arun Jaitley announced a series of measures in Budget 2017-18 to promote clean energy, access to power and energy security, that will result in 20 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity addition, higher spending on rural electrification, two new strategic oil reserves and lower import duty on liquified natural gas (LNG) and items used in making solar cells and panels.
				   
				In his budget speech, Jaitley said full electrification of 18,452 villages identified in 2015 will be achieved by 1 March 2018, for which Rs4,814 crore will be spent in the next financial year, a 43%jump from what is estimated to have spent this fiscal. Of this, so far, close to 12,000 villages have been electrified.Jaitly announced setting up of 20 GW of solar power capacity and feeding 7,000 railway stations with solar power, giving a major impetus to the shift to clean energy. Over the last two years, the share of solar power in the countys energy mix has been gradually increasing, while that of thermal power has been declining. As on 31 December, thermal power capacity accounts for 69% of the countrys 310 gigawatt (GW) power generation capacity, while solar power account for 2.7%.Also read:Union Budget 2017: Key highlightsSolar energy, with the help of government policies and the falling global prices, is now at an inflection point where it can compete on its own against other forms of energy, said Sanjeev Aggarwal, managing director and chief executive of Amplus Energy Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Two new strategic oil reserves announced will be built in Odisha and Rajasthan, Jaitley said. India has already built underground crude oil storage capacities at three locationsVishakhapatnam, Mangalore and Padur with a total 5.3 million tonne capacity. The facility at Vishakhapatnam has already been filled up and half of the Mangalore storage facility has been filled. India in January signed a deal with the United Arab Emirates for filling the rest of the facility at Mangalore. The idea is to have enough oil reserves in case of any disruption in crude oil supplies to the country in the event of any geopolitical tension. Oil refiners like Indian Oil Corp. have inventory sufficient to meet three weeks of demand. Jaitley also cut import duty on LNG from 5% to 2.5% and on solar tempered glass that goes into manufacturing of solar cells, panels and modules from 5% to zero. Also, materials that go into making such glass will now attract countervailing duty at 6% compared to 12.5% earlier. Machinery used in generating power using natural gas without combustion employing fuel cell technology has also been given import duty relief with the idea of promoting clean energy use in the economy. Dev Arora, founder & chief executive officer of 8minutes Future Energy Pvt Ltd, a solar power company said the move to reduce import duty on solar tempered glass will help improve cost efficiency in manufacturing of key solar equipment like solar cells, panels and modules and enable companies to reduce capital costs, which will ultimately benefit the consumer.",2017-02-01,jmeTMQYkdO9HHoktcPSSgK,"In his budget speech, Arun Jaitley said full electrification of 18,452 villages identified in 2015 will be achieved by 1 March  2018",14:37,Union Budget 2017: Arun Jaitley focuses on clean power and energy security
0.78,"Mumbai: The proposed merger between Vodafone and Idea can fetch the combined entity upto 350 basis points in cost savings, even though the move is unlikely to lead to better pricing power for operators in the short-term, says a report. International rating agency Fitch on Wednesday therefore retained its negative outlook on the sector, citing that fierce competition and rising capex will put pressure on most operators in 2017. 
				   
				We expect the merger of Idea with Vodafone can improve the combined Ebidta margin by 250-350 bps due to cost savings, mainly on network and marketing expenses. The combined entity will also have a more balanced subscriber mix, as Vodafone is strong in urban areas while Idea focuses more on the rural market, Fitch said in a note today. We estimate the merger would create an entity with 390 million subscribers, a leading revenue market share of around 40%, revenue of USD 11 billion and an Ebidta margin of 28-30%, it said. However, the merger can create significant opportunities for capex savings by eliminating duplicate network investments and avoiding future spectrum auctions, as the combined entity will have sufficient spectrum to expand 3G/4G services across the circles. An all-share merger along with a possible equity injection will strengthen the combined entitys balance sheet and provide flexibility for more capex, it said, and noted that Ideas balance sheet is stretched now with debt-equity ratio of about five times or at about Rs34,000 crore.

0.97,"Moscow/London: Two years ago, the Kremlins oil flagship was foundering, hit by falling prices and international sanctions just as it faced $20 billion in debt payments.
				   
				Short of cash, Rosneft got about $15 billion of emergency aid with help from the central bank. But the deal spooked investors, requiring a massive rate increase to stem market turmoil. Chief executive officer Igor Sechin, the man Vladimir Putin had for a decade relied on to build Rosneft into a giant, faced rare disfavour from his patron, senior officials said at the time.Now, Putin is turning to Rosneft for help. Sechins energy colossus is helping fill a yawning budget gap at home and support the Kremlin abroad. The companys turnaround is a triumph for the Russian president, who vowed to protect the pillars of his state-dominated system from US and European Union pressure when they were slapped with sanctions two years ago.Russia is among dozens of petro-states that are learning to make do with less as oil prices show no signs of major recovery. For some, like Saudi Arabia, the rout has provided an added impetus for economic overhauls, while othersincluding Putins Russiathe priority has been to paper over cracks with short-term fixes that dont reduce their reliance on petroleum.Also Read: Rosneft buy of Bashneft gives impetus to privatization: Vladimir PutinIts very important to the Kremlin that Rosneft is a strong company, said James Henderson, a former banker who is now a senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. Russias foreign policy as much as domestic policy relies on it.Shopping spreeJust last week, Rosneft spent 330 billion rubles ($5 billion) to buy control of another oil company from the government, the biggest privatization deal yet this year. Then Putin backed a plan under which Rosneft could provide an even bigger cash infusion, spending as much as $11 billion to buy a chunk of its own shares from the government. On 15 October, it announced a deal to buy a big refinery and other assets in India, under which it will pay $3.5 billion for a 49% stake. Putin presided over the signing of that agreement on a visit to Goa, confirming that Rosneft remains a favoured Kremlin tool for binding political ties with business links.Even Putin seemed surprised at Rosnefts recovery. At a meeting with budget officials, he said hed instructed the appropriate agencies to check that Rosneft had the funds on its accounts and wouldnt need to borrow to make the payments to the government.The Kremlin, too, has managed to weather the worst of the pain so far, thanks to billions in petrodollars saved up when oil prices were high, the sharp devaluation of the ruble and help from China and other friends outside the West. His economy steadying, Putin shows no sign of softening his confrontational approach to the US and Europe. Hes pushing his advantage in Syria, moving new missiles to Europes borders and, according to US intelligence, deploying hackers to meddle in the presidential elections.The key to Rosnefts turnaroundeven as oil prices have languishedwas a combination of financial engineering, the weakened ruble, political support and a little help from some friends: billions of dollars in advance payments from buyers in China. Rosnefts cash pile stood at more than $22 billion at the end of the second quarter, almost double what it had early last year.A Rosneft spokesman didnt respond to a request for comment for this article.Once an also-ran made up of the scraps of the Soviet oil industry that the 1990s oligarchs didnt want, Rosnefts fortunes turned as Putin moved to restore Kremlin control of the strategic sector in the early 2000s. He installed fellow intelligence veteran Sechin to lead the company in 2004. Rosneft took over the bulk of Yukos, a company the government seized from Putin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky. In 2013 Rosneft became the largest publicly traded oil producer on the planet when it purchased TNK-BP, a venture of the British company and a trio of Russian billionaires, for more than $50 billion. It borrowed more than $30 billion for that deal, one of the largest-ever financings by a Russian company.But soon after the TNK-BP deal, Rosnefts proximity to Putin became a liability.Also Read: Will Rosneft deal benefit Essar Oil shareholders?Eager to hit the Russian leader in his pocketbook after the March 2014 annexation of Crimea, the US announced sanctions targeting Sechin, citing his utter loyalty to Vladimir Putin. Later, the US and EU slapped limits on Rosneft, restricting access to technology and capital markets. Igor sanctionForeign lenders whod once battled for Rosnefts favour couldnt do business with it. BPs CEO joked that Sechins new nickname was Igor Sanction.By that fall, Rosneft was again walloped as oil fell below $100. Soon, it was asking the Kremlin for a $43 billion rescue. Putin balked at the huge sum, which was nearly as big as the bailouts the largest US banks got back in 2009 and would have used up much of one of Russias two sovereign wealth funds.The crisis of 2014 made investors panic, said Oleg Popov, a Moscow money manager who owns Rosnefts bonds. It was a perfect storm.But just days before a $7 billion payment to western banks came due in December 2014, Rosneft got its lifeline. Through a complicated series of transactions that stretched over several months, it issued 1 trillion rubles in bonds that a local bank used as collateral to borrow as much as $15 billion from the Russian central bank to lend on to the oil giant. The state bank that came up with the scheme couldnt participate because of sanctions, so Rosneft took the idea to another lender, according to a person familiar with the deals. Apparently fearful the US could extend the restrictions to squeeze the institution involved, Rosneft kept the nature of the deal a secret.But when word of the bond issue leaked out, its huge size alarmed local investors, who dumped the ruble.Only an emergency 6.5-percentage-point rate hike and heavy Kremlin pressure on exporters to sell foreign currency were enough to stabilize the exchange rate. Sechin publicly denied any role in the rubles plunge, threatening to deal with provocateurs who alleged the company was involved. Rosnefts London-traded shares dropped to the lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis.Putin criticismThe botched bailout angered top officials including Putin, people familiar with the situation said at the time. Sechin faced a rare public criticism from the president in a late-night meeting. A prominent Moscow newspaper editor tweeted that rumors were swirling among the capitals elite gathered at the Bolshoi Theater for a ballet premiere that Sechin was about to be fired. Rosneft denied it.Sechin tried to make amends, selling tens of billions of dollars earned from oil sales to buy rubles, helping steady the currency. He cut capital spending. To raise cash, the company pitched stakes in major Siberian projects to investors in China and India.The plunging ruble became a blessing, lowering Rosnefts costs in dollar terms and cushioning the blow of low oil prices, since crude is sold in dollars. A fifty-dollar barrel is worth 53% more, in ruble terms, today than it was two years ago.Also Read: Essar Oil-Rosneft deal likely to escape capital gains tax due to Mauritius treatyFurther relief came when customersnever publicly identified by Rosneft, but assumed by analysts to be led by state-controlled China National Petroleum Corp.made $15 billion in prepayments for future crude supplies in the third quarter of 2015. By early this year, Sechin had reclaimed his traditional position in Putins good books, touting Rosnefts results in a personal meeting with the leader. He also installed a veteran executive whod built up government connections during a stint as a deputy energy minister, Pavel Fedorov, as his de-facto No. 2.Rosnefts market capitalization topped that of Gazprom, the state gas monopoly and its traditional rival for political affections, for the first time in April. BP, which owns a 20% stake in Rosneft, reported that its share of the Russian companys profits last year contributed almost a quarter of its earnings, the largest share ever. In June, Sechin said he thought his company could be worth as much as $130 billion, twice its current value and more than BP. Crude production would be up after several years of declines, he said.By accidentOver the last year, we cut our debt load in half, he told state television. For a company like ours thats under sanctions, thats a brilliant result, he added. Topping the market-capitalization ranks of Russian companies just happened by accident, he said with a smile.Still, investors have cause for skepticism. In its presentations, Rosneft doesnt count the billions of dollars of pre-payments as debt. Rating agencies believe it should, since the company has to repay them, with interest, in oil. When the prepayments are included, Rosneft had reduced its net debt since 2013 by only about $6 billion as of the end of the second quarter, according to Alexey Bulgakov, an analyst at Sberbank-CIB in Moscow. That compares with the companys claim to have cut net debt by more than $22 billion over the period.S&P Global Ratings this month called Rosnefts financial policy aggressive, warning that future acquisitions could lead debt to spike.The company faces as much as $16 billion in debt repayments before the end of next year, including the bulk of the central-bank facility, which the regulator is eager to see repaid, according to officials. At the same time, Rosneft still is pumping money into projects in Venezuela, where the business outlook is murky at best but the Kremlin is eager to maintain political ties.Goldman Sachs this week cut Rosneft shares to neutral from buy, warning that the company could start diverting its cash to value-eroding M&A.Political controlEven Rosnefts plan to buy its own shares is in part a reflection of weakness. The government efforts to find other buyers for the 19.5% stake it wants to unload have fallen flat, leaving Rosneft itself as the acquirer of last resort. Real privatization would happen at a later date, with Rosneft reselling it to unspecified outside investors at higher prices, Putin told reporters on the trip to India last weekend. On that visit, a jacket-less Sechin was sighted playing pool with the head of a state bank during a break in the talks. (Sechin won.)Concerns about the giant companys efficiency were among the reasons Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and senior members of his cabinet cited in opposing Rosnefts bid for Bashneft, the company Rosneft bought in the privatization this month. They argued the sale should be used to boost the private sector. But Rosneft offered as much as $1 billion more than rival bidders and after months of mixed signals, Putin ruled against his officials, saying he was a bit surprised theyd ever been opposed.The current leadership believes that political control is more important than market efficiency, said Edward Chow, a former Chevron executive who is now a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

0.63,"Singapore: Monday evenings coup at Bombay House, the headquarters of Indias steel-to-software conglomerate Tata, was as swift as it was abrupt.
				   
				Not only did the board of Tata Sons, the holding company, dump Cyrus Mistry as chairman after less than four years, it also brought back Ratan Tata, 78, as the interim boss, leaving nobody in any doubt that the founding family of the 148-year-old empire was reasserting control.But what made Tata reach for the nuclear option?The companys brief statement gave no clues, though conspiracy theories range from Mistrys futile attempts at micro-managing a maddening potpourri of companies, to not having a nose for talent (a six-member executive council put together by him was also disbanded), and selling the family silver to pay down debt when he should have focused more on growth.Investors in Tatas suite of operating companies were picking up signs of discord, but were still unprepared for a coup. After all, Ratan Tata seemed to be nothing less than delighted when a selection committee tasked to find his successor returned from a 15-month global hunt with the idea that Mistry  a member of the search panel as well as the son of a large shareholder  was the best choice. If the 48-year-old executive is now being removed for being out of his depth, the more experienced Ratan Tata deserves some blame for putting him in that position in the first place.Also Read: Understanding the Tata Sons boardroom coupBesides, its not clear that Mistry was doing a lousy job. Start the clock in late August 2004, when the IPO of software business Tata Consultancy created the group as it exists today. In the subsequent eight years that Tata guided the behemoth, a market capitalization-weighted index of its 26 listed units barely managed to beat the Sensex. Over a shorter time frame, Mistry has outperformed the benchmark more convincingly.When it comes to future returns, though, Ratan Tata may have reasons to be anxious about the direction in which Mistry was steering the ship.Tata took advantage of a China-fueled boom in commodity demand to load up on debt, which led to an eightfold expansion in the annual net income of the groups publicly traded companies in the six years through 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But with overcapacity in the Peoples Republic hitting the groups steel business hard, profitability waned.In wanting to reduce leverage by selling everything from money-losing UK steel operations to coal mines in Indonesia and hotels in the US, Mistry has veered too far away from his predecessors expansionist strategy. With the pace of capital expenditure down to a 12-month run rate of $2 billion versus $3.7 billion in Tatas final year at the helm, the group runs the risk of courting irrelevance. Also Read: Cyrus Mistry ouster could slow Tata groups debt reduction processMore worrisome, from a Tata perspective, is that the group nowadays makes news mostly for the wrong reasons. Whether its an almost $1 billion jury award against its software unit for a US intellectual-property infringement case, or the embarrassment of losing a $1.17 arbitration brought against Tata Sons by NTT Docomo for alleged failure to honour a partnership contract, the conglomerates reputation for good corporate citizenship has taken a beating.Its hard to say if Mondays putsch will fix everything from strategic wobbles to PR snafus. Investors will want to see if the mutiny leads to a bounty in the form of superior shareholder returns. That depends mainly on whether the search panel gets lucky this time around. Pending the induction of the new chairman, however, what matters is how operating companies  and their bosses  react to Ratan Tatas return.For now, palace intrigue looks unlikely to affect performance.

				Mobius, who oversees the Templeton research team based in 18 global emerging markets offices, said he would give high marks for the performance of the Narendra Modi government so far. He cautioned that after  the passage of reforms, the focus would shift to implementation.We have got to see implementation of those reforms so that the economy can grow and accelerate and continue on the high growth rate. So, I would say India offers an opportunity and a pitfall, and we have to keep an eye out for it, he added in an interview.Edited excerpts: India has recently seen three big reforms over the past few monthsthe goods and services tax, a relaxation in foreign direct investment norms and the bankruptcy law being passed. As an investor, how do you view these steps? Are these the last of the big reforms from the Modi government?All those steps are very good and the tax one is excellent. Now, what has to be done is implementation, because implementation with each state is really the key going forward. So, we have to look and see how fast implementation can take place, because that will determine the success of this reform. But, we are very excited about these changes, and the impact, of course, will be far-reaching, and will really be very dramatic going forward. Thats really the key, because we must not overlook the fact that implementation is probably more difficult. Getting passed in Parliament is one thing, but getting each state to implement it, to reduce the bureaucracy, to make things more efficientthat is really the key to success.The perception among investors outside is that the Indian markets are expensive. We are very excited about the Indian market. If you look at global firms, youll notice that India rating has been increasing. We are definitely very focused on India. Growth rate is very high, and we believe that this will continue with the reforms that we have seen, and so we are quite excited about it.Which are the sectors in the Indian market that you are excited about?First one, of course, is techsoftware, in particular, is very good for us. Secondly, it is the consumer sector and, particularly with the tax reform, I believe that the consumer sector will really surge ahead. Also, the companies and industries that will benefit from the revolution in communications with RILs (Reliance Industries Ltds) entry into telecoms, they are going to make telecommunicationsdatacheaper for everyone in India. This will set off a revolution in innovation and, I believe, companies that can benefit from that will really be the ones that you would want to look at. A lot of that will be consumer-oriented.How do you see RILs entry into telecoms? Will it be a game changer?No question about it. It is going to be a game changer. By bringing down the cost of the telecoms, and by enabling people to utilize telecommunications in a bigger way, cheaper, faster and more efficient way, the entire composition of the economy will change. This goes for the financial sector, it goes for the consumer sector, even goes for the industrial sectorso, everybody will be impacted by this. Its true that the competition has been hurt temporarily with RILs entry, but I think they will step up to the plate and be ready to compete.Which sectors in the Indian market should one avoid at this time?I think it is not avoidbut we have to be very cautious when it comes to the finance sector. As I mentioned, the changes that telecommunications and mobile will bring about to banking and transfer of moneythat is going to have a big impact on the financial sector. Those financial sector companies that are not able to keep up, they will be at a disadvantage. The other area is the companies that have benefited from the restrictionsstate restrictions, border control restrictions, tax restrictionsthese companies are going to be impacted soon, and we have to be very careful. Again, the companies which had state monopolies in certain areas because of the inability of competitors to come inthose companies are going to be impacted, too. So, we have to be careful about not picking these companies. Recently, in your blog, you had said while India is growing faster than China, the latter continues to be your top bet among emerging markets.Thats mainly because of the size of China. You have a lot of liquid and large companies in the China market, and access is easy through the Hong Kong market, which enables us to get in and out of Chinese companies. However, with these reforms in India, you will see the rating on India increase. If you see our global funds, you will see that happening already.Overall, how worried or optimistic are you on China?I am pretty optimistic about China. I know people are concerned about the debt, about the leverage, etc., but at the end of the day, it is a communist-controlled society, and they can control the heavy leverage that a lot of the companies have. As you know, the big banks and big companies there are all controlled by the government... Its a big economygrowth is continuing not only because of government spending, but also because of private sector growth. So, were optimistic. But in a country like that, just like in India, there will be winners and losers. We have to be very careful in stock selection.In a recent blog, you said that in 2016, emerging markets have outperformed developed markets in US dollar terms. What is your take on the mid-term and long-term performance of emerging markets equities when compared with the developed markets?In the long term, there is no question that emerging markets will outperform for the simple reason that economic growth in emerging markets will continue to be at least double that of the developed countries. So, as long as that is the case, we can expect emerging markets to outperform. If you look at history, there is a correlation between market performance and economic growth. So, thats an important point to keep in mind. The other thing is that there is a slew of frontier marketscountries that are just starting out in the market economy adventure and these companies and countries will be growing at a very fast pace because theyre starting from a low base. That also will boost emerging markets generally.How do you see the emerging markets being impacted by the gradual increase in US interest rates?Its very important to look at the history of interest rates and emerging markets performance. If you compare the US Feds funds rate against the emerging markets performance, there is no real correlation. For example, the period between 1988 and 1993, interest rates went down and the emerging markets went up. Everybody expects a correlation between interest rates and performance; but then, if you look at the period from 2003 to 2007, interest rates went up and the emerging markets boomed. From 2007-09, the correlation held because interest rates went down and the emerging markets went down. So, its different from what you would expect. I think people are putting too much weight on the interest rate, particularly the US Federal Reserve rate and what the markets will do. There is a good chance that if the US Fed raises the interest rate, then emerging markets could outperform. You just cannot say that when interest rates go up, the market goes down. It doesnt work that way. History shows thats not the case.How do you rate the performance of the Modi government so far? Do you think it has delivered on many of its promises in terms of reforms, in terms of ease of doing business?I think there was too much euphoria when they were elected, and we foresaw that they would have difficulty in the beginning. So, we didnt expect the tremendous surge of reforms because we knew the barriers that they were facing in Parliament and so forth. However, the fact that they have been able to pass the tax reform and that they have been able to make changes is very heartening to us. To us, it indicates that the Modi government has done a pretty good job. I would have like to see (former Reserve Bank of India governor) Raghuram Rajan to stay on in the central bank. That is probably one negative to the Modi government; but then, if his successor continues on the same policies in a quiet way, then it should be OK. I would say we would give them high marks for performance.In India, what do you feel are the challenges and risks going forward?Again, it is not just the degree to which reform takes place. We have got to see implementation of those reforms so that the economy can grow and accelerate and continue on the high growth rate. So, I would say India offers an opportunity and a pitfall, and we have to keep an eye out for it.How do you see the private equity space in South-East Asia?Its very good. It is a great opportunity here in South-East Asia because there are so many new enterprises that are getting started and, of course, the impact of China on South-East Asia, in most parts, is very positive. China is, of course, the main trading partner, and as China surges ahead, these countries will be pulled along with them. So, lots of opportunities in the private sector area.",2016-09-22,kFXB0BUoKhEy9eTdD8w8JM,"Templetons emerging markets fund manager Mark Mobius says Reliance Jios launch will only  impact the telecom space, but also other sectors and the Indian economy",07:50,Reliance Jios entry a game changer: Mark Mobius
1.0,"New York: IBM Corp. is teaming up with Slack Technologies Inc. to make it easier for companies to build custom chatbots into the start-ups workplace-messaging systems, the latest move by Big Blue to add more diverse business cases for its Watson artificial-intelligence technology.
				   
				The two companies will release a developer toolkit that includes Watson technologies and can integrate easily into Slack, they said in a statement Wednesday. International Business Machines Corp. will also build a chatbota conversation-based applicationthat will help IT departments identify and resolve issues without having to leave the Slack platform. The start-ups own customer-service bot will incorporate the Watson Conversation system, which includes technologies such as speech-to-text conversion and natural-language processing, or the ability for a computer to understand what a person is saying.Right now, if you say something to Slackbot in Slack, it will kind of blindly take what you ask it and do a search, Slack chief executive officer Stewart Butterfield said. The bot tries to match the query to a preset document and doesnt have any AI technologies helping it decode the meaning of the question. With Watsons technology, the system will better understand and learn about the way users ask about things and will collect better results, he said.Sending messages using applications such as Slack or Facebook Inc.s WhatsApp or Messenger has become an attractive communication method for both consumers and companies, leading to a boom in chatbots. Businesses are eager to interact with their customers on these platforms using bots, which can provide direct contact without requiring them to hire a bunch of customer-service representatives or salespeople to do the leg work.A virtual agent that can answer questions and synthesize large reams of data is useful because its a faster way to get people the right answer versus going through files and finding it themselves, said David Kenny, general manager at IBM Watson. It enables people to work with machines the way they work with each otherits a more natural way to work.Bot expertiseArmonk, New York-based IBM has come across a number of old and new clients that are creating these kinds of conversational bots, building them from various Watson technologiesputting them together like Lego blocks. To make it easier for companies to build chatbots, IBM has also combined the relevant blocks to create a new service, Watson Virtual Agent, according to a separate statement. Companies using this service can pick a specific focus for the bots expertise, such as retail, and can train it using internal proprietary data, Kenny said.The push in chatbots is IBMs latest move to add more artificial intelligence to software, an extension of its overall bet that companies will pay for AI products that can automate business processes. The suite of Watsons AI services is key to IBMs strategy to drive growth in software sales, especially as demand ebbs for older products.About 30,000 IBM employees use Slacks messaging system, making it one of the San Francisco start-ups biggest customers. The goal of the new partnership for both companies is to use AI to quickly provide insights from the huge data sets collected by the messaging system, yet require a lot of processing power to analyse. Each Slack customer, for example, has archived messages about everything from human-resources questions to sales data to network issues, all information that can be fed to an artificial intelligence machine that can be used to advise people on later inquiries and problemsvia, say, a chatbot interface. Both companies agree that theyre at the beginning stages of building new technology that can achieve that vision.Its hard to overestimate the degree of difficulty or depths we have to go to, Butterfield said. IBM has huge investments in this area and they have a great idea of the opportunities.",2016-10-26,kMXUqXsejAjHN5tUKKGM5H,IBM will build a chatbota conversation-based applicationthat will help IT departments identify and resolve issues without having to leave the Slack platform,16:51,IBM teams up with Slack to build smarter data-crunching chatbots

During the quarter, the benchmark Singapore complex margin increased by $1.5 per barrel sequentially to $6.7 per barrel. RILs revenue from the refining segment was up at 7.5% at Rs61,693 crore.RIL is the operator of the worlds biggest oil-refinery complex with a refining capacity of 1.24 million barrels of oil per day, located at Jamnagar in Gujarat.The companys petrochemicals business sprang a surprise. Analysts had expected the segment to show weaker numbers on the back of falling margins and demonetization.Segment revenue in the petrochemicals business grew 17.8% to Rs22,584 crore. Earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) grew faster at 25.5%. As a result, the petrochemical margin was a better-than-expected 14.4%, up 80 basis points from a year ago.

				After outside managers divvied up shipping magnate Sammy Ofers hundreds of tankers, container carriers, and other cargo vessels into two groups of equal value, sons Idan and Eyal each picked one out of a hat as their mother looked on.We literally reached in and grabbed an envelope, says the younger brother, Idan, 61. And thats it. It was peaceful, no drama. They did something similar with paintings by Picasso and Van Gogh and the rest of their fathers art collection. Other family assetsreal estate, bank shares, a stake in Israels biggest chemical companywere evenly divided based on the brothers involvement in the various businesses. Eyal, 66, took over Sammys stakes in Israels Mizrahi Tefahot Bank Ltd, property developer Melisron Ltd., real estate around the world, and a stake in Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Idan got control of Israels largest public holding company and various tech investments.ALSO READ: Indias middle-class billionairesIn terms of carving up colossal wealth, the Ofers did things as smoothly as possible. The brothers need look no further than their cousins Liora and Doron Ofer, the children of Sammys brother Yuli, to see how inheritance disputes can tear a family asunder. Those siblings are no longer on speaking terms after a legal squabble over Yulis stake in an investment company. Liora today controls assets valued at $2.3 billion, while Dorons share is $675 million, according to Bloomberg index calculations.Liora Ofer declined to comment for the story and Doron Ofer didnt respond to requests for comment. Eyal declined to be interviewed.Bad luck and differing appetites for risk, though, have turned Idan and Eyals equitable split into fortunes as lopsided as their cousins. Idans bank balance has been battered by a commodities slump, ill-timed investment bets, and increased scrutiny in Israel. Eyal, by contrast, has added to his wealth with office buildings and hotels across the US and Europe. When the split was finalized in 2013, both brothers were worth more than $6 billion. Idans stash has since dropped to $3 billion while the fortune of Eyal has grown to $8.6 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Tracking the value of his portfolio doesnt make me happy, Idan says, munching chocolate-covered rice cakes in his bright corner office in Londons Mayfair neighbourhood, where a large black-and-white photo of his bespectacled father peers over his shoulder. But Im used to it. And Im not a speculator. Having a background in shipping makes me comfortable with cyclical things.The brothers were born in Israel, then attended boarding school in Britain before returning home to fulfil their military service. After studying maritime law in London, Eyal worked alongside his father to expand the familys cargo shipping business. Idan, a 1982 graduate of the University of Haifa, chafed at the idea of sharing what he calls the same small office with his dad. He instead moved to Hong Kong and expanded the group into tankers.After a decade in Asia and a couple of years in New York, Idan was drawn back home. The family that owned a giant holding group called Israel Corp. Ltd was feuding and wanted to cash out. In 1999, the Ofers paid $330 million for a controlling interest in the company and Idan was appointed chairman. His homecoming was a coronation for the new prince of Israeli industry.That investment stands at the root of Idans declines. He now controls Israel Corp., whose primary asset is fertilizer giant Israel Chemicals Ltd. In 2008, filmmaker Miki Rosenthal released a documentary called The Shakshuka System, a reference to an Israeli dish of eggs and tomato sauce, which Rosenthal used as a metaphor for the Ofers relationship with politicians. The film says the Ofers used their close ties to government officials to buy state-owned companies on the cheap.Idan sued Rosenthal for libel in 2009 and the two parties settled out-of-court. Idan says he got no bargain on the companies, and that his restructuring netted the government more than $2 billion. Rosenthal, now a member of parliament with the Labour party, says Idan tried using false claims to scare and dissuade me from completing the film. Those efforts to prevent the movie from being shown aroused considerable curiosity, Rosenthal said in a statement.In 2011, middle-class Israelis took to the streets of Tel Aviv and other cities to protest the rising cost of living, often blaming the countrys business elite sometimes singling out Idan for their woes. In turn, the government hiked taxes on ICLs domestic profits and considered stripping the company of potash mines it operates near the Dead Sea.When Idan in 2012 sought to sell ICL to Potash Corp. for $13.5 billion, Israeli lawmakers torpedoed the deal, saying it was against the national interest. As the price of potash, ICLs most profitable product, has tumbled about 75% in the past eight years, the familys stake in Israel Corp.now controlled by Idanhas fallen below $1 billion, from $6.5 billion in 2008.Though Idan has since moved to London, where he oversees his empire, he doesnt link his move to the rising tensions in Israel. Im a citizen of the world, Idan says. It was time for a change.Eyal, meanwhile, has lived abroad since the 1970s and long ago minimized his role in Israel Corp., thereby skirting the tumult Idan faced. Over the years, he quietly assembled a real estate empire, starting with distressed properties on Park Avenue South in Manhattan. His deep knowledge of ships meant he was comfortable with similarly tangible (if less moveable) assets like buildings. By 1990, hed bought and sold more than 30 of them.Today, his portfolio includes more than 50 properties in four countries, ranging from a Travelodge hotel in London to splashy projects like a 43-story limestone tower on Manhattans Central Park West, where Goldman Sachs chief executive officer Lloyd Blankfein and rock star Sting live in palatial apartments that cost as much as $88 million apiece.Even as Eyal has gotten more ambitious as a developer, he has kept a remarkably low profile, says Richard Fain, chairman of Royal Caribbean Cruises, who has known Ofer for decades. Hes very focused on doing things that are right and will enhance the reputation of his family.Partners who work with Eyal describe him as disciplined and highly-involved, actively grooming his four children to take over the family business, much as his father did. William Rudin, CEO of New York developer Rudin Management Co. Inc., who teamed up with Eyal on a luxury condo project in Greenwich Village, says the next generation frequently attend meetings.Its a generational thing. Eyals kids refer to their father as chairman, says Richard Meade, managing editor at Lloyds List, a shipping industry journal. Discipline is very much his watchword.If Eyals side resembles a classic, patriarchal family business, Idans is more an assemblage of bold moonshots. Scott Borgerson, CEO of Boston-based investment firm CargoMetrics Technologies LLC, says thats what happens when one combines extreme wealth with an erudite man of disparate interests. Surrounded by society A-listers at a glitzy party in Saint-Tropez in August, the two sat late into the evening debating 18th-century British and American colonial history.I have a PhD on this and Idan was teaching me stuff, says Borgerson, whose company counts Idan as an investor. But under his intellectual curiosity he has a hard edge.Idan says real estate doesnt interest him and he avoids mature markets for their slow growth. He has backed power stations in India and Peru, a Chinese automaker, and a start-up that makes home-testing kits for urine. In 2007 he invested in Better Place, an electric-car charging station operator that soared to a valuation of $2 billion in 2011 but went bankrupt two years later.About the time Better Place was peaking, Idan gambled on an industry few but a risk-loving billionaire could afford: deepwater oil-drilling rigs. In late 2011 he listed Pacific Drilling SA on the New York Stock Exchange, which valued his 69% stake at $1.2 billion. The oil rout has since driven the stock price down 95%.Neither brother has been spared shippings historic bust. Since January, both brothers fleets have lost about $1 billion in value, according to researcher Vessels Value. That plunge, thanks to oversupply and anemic trade, might crush a smaller operator. But Eyal and Idanwho control the 20th and 25th biggest fleets in the world, Zodiac Group and Quantum Pacific Shippinghave the cash to withstand it, according to Vessels Value analyst William Bennett.Your survival in this market is your luck and having very deep pockets, Bennett says.The only thing riskier than dividing up their late fathers empire may have been running it together. Idan and Eyal say they are close, but they dont discuss business. Eyal sees himself as the custodian of a treasure he intends to pass on to his children. Idan, whose eldest son is at Harvard Business School, says hes unsure what roleif anyhis children will play in his businesses. He says only lawyers win when families stay together and eventually start fighting.How many rich brothers can you think of have stayed together and still work together? he asks. My brother and I were very peaceful about it.

1.0,"India is firmly set on a path of economic growth that is estimated to usher in prosperity like never before. This economic prosperity will need to be built on the back of significant transformations across several facilitating elements, the primary ones being infrastructure build-out, energy availability and sustainability. Indias per capita energy consumption currently is almost one-third the global average, and trails far behind the mean figure for the developed world. Our energy consumption is largely based on coal, along with a preponderant dependence on other fossil fuels. Although per capita energy consumption has more than doubled over the past 15 years, almost 240 million people do not have access to affordable energy supply today. 
				   
				Energy consumption in India has grown at a compound annual growth rate of about 6% during the last decade. BP Energy Outlook 2035 expects India to achieve the fastest energy consumption growth among all major economies, despite rapid increases in non-fossil fuel production. The total energy consumption is expected to grow by 128% by 2035. Demand for gas is expected to expand by 155%, followed by coal (121%) and oil (118%), while demand for renewables, nuclear and hydro are estimated to rise by 656%, 334%, and 99%, respectively (see chart). Our potential clearly positions us as the leading global driver of growth in energy consumption in the next 20 years, possibly surpassing China in the process. Even under the most sombre growth scenarios, it is fully expected that Indias growth ambitions will lead to a 100% increase in energy consumption, thereby requiring double the existing energy sources. On the supply side, India is significantly dependent on coal as a primary fuel, which accounts for 58% of the energy consumption in the country. It is estimated that we have one of the largest resource bases of coal, with the policies and gains of the past few years positioning us strongly for the future. It is expected that India will be the largest consumer of coal, equivalent to over 435 million tonnes of oil by 2035. According to current estimates with respect to oil and gas, India is home to only 0.3% of the worlds sedimentary basins. Further, we account for a mere 0.3% of the global oil and 0.8% of the global gas reserves. We are, however, blessed with abundant natural resources in the form of sun and wind. The total wind potential in the country is estimated to be over 30 times the current installed capacity of 27 gigawatts (GW), while our solar potential is expected to grow by about 90 times the current installed capacity of 8GW. Already, the government has an aggressive target of 60GW of wind capacity and 100GW of solar capacity by 2022.ALSO READ | Believing in Indias solar mission takes a leap of faithSuccessive governments have embarked on addressing the forthcoming challenge at varying intensities and levels of aggressiveness. There are, however, some structural issues that affect the sector. Firstly, we have successively underpriced our resources, making the economics of the sector unattractive to a large number of serious investors. The energy subsidies over the years have been a major burden to the economy. The total subsidy for 2014-2015 was Rs76,285 crore. The diesel price deregulation and direct benefit transfer of liquefied petroleum gas subsidy coupled with low oil prices, led to a 64% drop in the subsidy burden for 2015-2016, which now stands at Rs27,571 crore. Gas prices in the country have also been fixed by the government based on different regional benchmarks. Domestic prices were reduced by over 50% from $5.1 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in November 2014 to $2.5 per mmBtu for the period between October and December 2016, making the sector unviable for producers, even though the country is in a supply deficit.Given this scenario, the newly announced pricing regime that promises market prices for natural gas produced from forthcoming fields is a favourable step to attract investment in the sector. While the government has provided support to several segments of our polity at different points in time, the mechanism of delivering such support has been inefficient. Secondly, past events in the policy and governance ecosystem have created the impression of a less-than-desirable regime of instability and lack of administrative efficiency. Thirdly, the relative naivety of infrastructure financing in the early years resulted in increased corporate leverage, without commensurate assets to underpin the debt levels, thus putting pressure on stakeholders, including financial institutions. These three factors, coupled with inefficient underlying processes and systems, have reduced the attractiveness of the sector to investors, whose participation is crucial for us to fulfil our 2035 aspirations.Our current path of growth and evolutionary reforms is likely to widen the gap between the supply and demand of energy, and has potential to cripple any aggressive growth plans. If no significant changes are made to the current trajectory, India might increase the burden on the fiscal front associated with energy independence and sustainability. We will then need to import significantly larger quantities of primary resources to fulfil our growth ambitions. BP expects Indias energy production as a share of consumption to decline from 57% in 2014 to 54% by 2035, and imports to rise by 153%. The countrys oil imports are expected to increase by 161%. This will account for 52% of the increase in imports, followed in volumetric terms by increases in coal imports by over 122%, and gas by over 301%.ALSO READ | A time of change for the oil industryThe future of India and its economic growth plans are critically linked to the fortunes of the energy sector.To propel this key primary sector to the next level, we need a combination of bold and aggressive moves, and a clean up to bring in more efficiency and effectiveness. The moves need to be comprehensive and coordinated. They must be focused on all aspects of managing the demand side, while fomenting the supply side, ensuring that critical enablers are in place, and firing on all cylinders. Given our requirements, the Indian energy landscape will continue to be a combination of fossil and new energy based solutions over the next 20 years. It will be important to get the balance right.The key question is, is it time to get even bolder on renewables? The present government has certainly made huge strides in achieving our renewables aspirations. Can we be the country that sets the course for a new development model for the energy sector? Can we blaze a new trial by learning from the mistakes of the more developed countries with regards to renewables? Is it possible for us to create a new paradigm for sustainable and viable development of the sector as the core to energy independence? All these would imply significant public and private investments in developing cost-effective technologies for the generation, storage and distribution of energy. So the main concern here is, is it better to channel government money earmarked for resource segments toward bets on the future of renewables? Significant innovation, both in terms of technologies and business models, will have to be made to turn the entire value chain into an attractive proposition. The key is to accelerate the process of building scale, experience, talent and knowledge, in order to help us advance the large-scale viability of the sector by many years.Secondly, commodity cycles normally go through high and lows. Currently, we are in one such trough. Is it time to make some aggressive moves that secure our fossil-related resources? The prolonged run of lower oil prices afforded the government an opportunity to create an investment fund to help Indian oil and gas companies bolster domestic as well as overseas investments. While some companies are actively seeking overseas opportunities by leveraging their own financials, we seem to have missed the opportunity for setting up a sovereign oil fund. The basis of this one-time infusion of funds to secure everything from resources to strategic reserves is paramount to our future energy independence. The often-mentioned challenge of how would we administer such a fund? is, at best, rhetorical. Our inability to find answers to such administration challenges has laid many a good idea to an early rest. Thirdly, we must consider complementing our initiatives for supply augmentation with measures that help increase our efficiency in managing demand. These initiatives also need to be supported by policies and regulations like time-of-day pricing, incentives and so on, along with large-scale investment in efficiency boosting technologies across the value chain.Finally, there is a need to rationalize the energy governance software infrastructure. The existing resource-focused governance structure (coal, oil and gas, renewables, etc.) should give way to a more integrated and comprehensive mechanism. Such a mechanism must help us understand the complex trade-offs, and allocate both human and financial resources with energy independence in mind, rather than just the oil versus gas versus coal versus renewables paradigm. The audit and licensing mindset must be replaced with effective measures to drive flexible administrative mechanisms that are more facilitative and supportive.In conclusion, the future of the economic growth of India is dependent on our ability to leverage energy sources to fuel our ambitions for the sector. In his book, The Audacity of Hope, Barack Obama, states, A nation that cant control its energy sources cant control its future. Securing our energy future is thus critical for India to become a superpower in the future.Kaustav Mukherjee is a senior partner and leads the energy practice at BCG India, and Rahool Pai Panandiker is a partner and director at BCG.",2017-01-18,mf6g1hQV6OlV6HIW5mQTiN,"Indias potential clearly positions us as the leading global driver of growth in energy consumption in the next 20 years, possibly surpassing China in the process",01:09,Indias economic growth is linked to the fortunes of the energy sector
0.25,"The anonymity of bitcoin gained its myriad adherents among anarchists and drug dealers around the world. Now, though, its looking like the digital currency isnt quite anonymous enough.
				   
				Consider the sudden popularity of Zcash and Monero, two new cryptocurrencies that offer confidential transactions. When Zcash first became available last week, demand was so strong that its founders temporarily became paper billionaires. Monero rose to fame after a popular marketplace in the dark webthe portion of the Internet where people sell everything from guns to hacking toolsadded it as a payment option. The newcomers sense opportunity in one of bitcoins flaws: Analytics companiesfueled by government research grantshave gotten really good at exposing users identities, which were supposed to be hidden by public keys that reduced them to a mere string of numbers and letters. This is possible because all transactions are recorded in a permanent public ledger, allowing anyone to see the entire history of each bitcoin and all the activity of each account. A single payment to an online retailer can be enough to reveal a users identity, which in turn reveals everything that person has done with that account.In other words, the same transparency that guarantees the validity of bitcoin transactions also allows people to find out whether a users bitcoin previously passed through dirty hands. Such information is both an asset and a liability. Its useful for helping service providers make informed decisions about whether they want someone as a customer, but it can come with the responsibility of having to screen those customers to stay on the right side of the law. The US government, for example, has outsourced some of its crime-fighting job by requiring financial institutionsincluding digital currency exchangesto enforce anti-money-laundering regulations. Drug-dealing and tax evasion can be tough to stop at the source, but the perpetrators typically have to move money, so banks and exchanges are in a good position to identify and report illicit activity.On the surface, privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies seem designed precisely to undermine such controls. Monero mixes multiple transactions together so that a source cannot be directly linked to a destination. Zcash creates shielded transactions where everything is hidden except for a string of data that proves the transaction is valid. Bitcoin also plans to add some of these features in the near future.As bad as it looks, though, developers arent creating anonymous payment systems because they want to help criminals evade the law. Theyre doing it because thats the only way a decentralised currency can work. If, say, users have to evaluate the acceptability of each bitcoin based on its transaction history, then one coin can be worth more than another and the currency loses its reason for existence.The dollar is successful because its pretty much always worth a dollar, backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. Thats true whether its freshly printed or old and torn, whether it has a pristine history or has passed through the hands of Al Capone. A publicly controlled digital currency doesnt have that legal tender status and probably never will, so it must find some other way to achieve the same fungibility.Anonymity achieves this by preventing merchants or service providers from seeing any blemishes that might prevent them from honouring a unit of currency. Reducing the opportunity for external judgment is pretty much the goal of privacy protection in general. Ideally, so little information is revealed that everyoneand every valid transactionis treated equally.Decentralised currencies arose because people wanted to transact in a digital world without having to ask permission. The extent to which this facilitates criminal activity depends entirely on the prevalence of criminal activity in the real world. Maybe thats a problem that needs to be addressed outside the monetary system.

There is a risk if the increase in oil prices is more than anticipated.Decline in LNG custom duty is positive for the sector. Analysts expect Petronet LNGs utilizations to get some fillip. Gas distributors such as Indraprastha Gas Ltd and Mahanagar Gas Ltd are expected to benefit on account of this move. Their profit margins could improve depending on the extent of the decline in prices the companies pass on to consumers. In general, decline in LNG custom duty is expected to encourage the use of natural gas, which is considered a relatively cleaner fuel.As regards the creation of an integrated oil major, while the idea is certainly laudable, the key challenge will be integration issues especially on the human resources side, pointed out K.

0.25,"On 13 October, the fertilizer ministry issued an office memo stating that the movement of finished fertilizers by coastal shipping/inland waterways will be eligible for a freight subsidy granted by the government to fertilizer firms.
				   
				 So far, only railway freight for primary movement of finished fertilizers from plants/ports to the nearest railway station of the dealers was reimbursed. The fertilizer ministry has a yearly budget of about Rs2,000 crore for this subsidy.Primary movement has been redefined and expanded to cover transportation by rail, and/or coastal shipping or inland water transport or by any or two or by all three modes of transportation from the plant or port to the various railway rake points of districts (where dealers are located), P.B. Sahu, a fertilizer ministry official, wrote in the memo. Fertilizer firms in the public, private and co-operative sectors pay the railway freight for the primary movement and then claim the money from the government, according to the practice followed.In the new regime, freight subsidy for primary movement using coastal shipping/inland water transport will be reimbursed by the government in the same manner but at the lower of the equivalent railway rates or actual rates paid by the fertilizer firms, Sahu said.The development lends a big boost to coastal shipping and inland water transport, which the government is seeking to promote to ease congestion on rail and road, reduce carbon emissions and cut logistics costs.Fertilizer is seen as an ideal cargo to shift to water. Fertilizer production is very energy-intensivewith the cost of feedstock and fuel alone accounting for 55-80% of production cost. From the logistics perspective, therefore, production cost is of particular interest. Growing agri-produce and an increase in the overall sown area will prompt greater demand for fertilizer end-productsaround 70 million tonnes (mt) by 2020 and around 120 mt by 2035. The volume of imports of fertilizer raw materials and finished products will grow at 4%, keeping the volumes handled at Indian ports fairly stable by 2020.Indias 12 ports owned by the central government loaded 8.493 mt of finished fertilizers in the year to March 2016, clocking growth of 8.18%. While rail is currently the primary mode of transport for long-distance fertilizer movement, experts say a modal-mix shift towards coastal shipping can significantly cut costs. For instance, the movement between Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra costs Rs1,928 per tonne via rail, while the same movement via road and rail-supported coastal shipping could cut cost to as low as Rs1,415 per tonnea potential cost saving of 25-30%, according to the ministry. If key rail movements are considered from major fertilizer plants to the top-200 fertilizer-consuming districts in India, around 10 plants have the potential to shift to coastal shipping, the ministry reckons.Fertilizer corporations with multiple plant locations across the country seem to have the highest potential to leverage coastal shipping.Finished products constitute half of the 28 mt of fertilizers that India imports in a year, with raw materials for the farm nutrients making up the other half. The inclusion of coastal shipping/inland water transport in the freight subsidy scheme for moving fertilizers could spur interest among fleet owners by purchasing the right vessels that can move seamlessly between sea and inland waterways to tap this business. Indias maritime regulator, the director general of shipping, has already set rules for running the so-called river-sea vessels.After putting in place an enabling environment to kick-start the fledgling sector through the Sagarmala programme, the government is now targeting fertilizers and automobiles to show the way. The shipping of cars by sea on roll-on-roll-off ships is slowly picking up on the back of an 80% discount in vessel-related and cargo-related charges over the rates approved at the ports owned by the Indian government for a two-year period.The shipment of cars on national waterway 1 between Varansai and Haldia has also commenced.Water currently contributes less than 6% to Indias modal mix and the government is looking to double this share by 2025. China uses its inland waterways to transport raw material and finished goods between the eastern and western provinces; water contributes 24% to Chinas freight modal mix. Australia carries 17% of goods through coastal shipping. In Germany, 11% of goods are moved through inland waterways and coastal shipping.If the movement of automobiles and fertilizers through coastal shipping and inland waterways catches up, it would not be long before producers of other commodities such as oil, liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas, steel, iron ore, coal and cement also seriously consider a big switch to this cost-effective and eco-friendly mode of transport, with a little more support from the government. This would give a lot more confidence to cargo owners, who are now sceptical about the sustainability of such a shift, to move their goods by water.The fertilizer ministrys decision to bring coastal shipping and inland water transport under the freight subsidy plan shows that the Narendra Modi government is willing to tweak existing schemes to prop up the twin sectors, rather than formulate new incentive packages to achieve the objective. Many more funding schemes with individual ministries/departments can be tapped to promote water transport.P. Manoj looks at trends in the shipping industry.",2016-10-28,o4WIJOP90gHDELZ7KCWZGM,Fertilizer ministrys decision to bring coastal shipping and inland water transport under freight subsidy plan shows government is willing to tweak schemes to prop up the twin sectors,00:10,"Will fertilizers, automobiles show water transport the way?"

It hit them hard that they lost their jobs, their savings dwindled and so on. They were then willing to gamble with their politics, or take a blind, under-analysed bet on anyone who promised them these basics. People have been hurt widely since 2008they are angry, bewildered why their perfect lives suddenly went badand smart politicians across the world have leveraged on this by showing easy cures and fantasy fixes. The extremist politics is just peoples answer of their outrage to why us? That is what also led to events that we saw in 2016.How do you see 2017 panning out for Indian markets?I am very negative on large cap (stocks) in India in light of the recent demonetization. I was tepid about them before. I am, however bullish on Indian small cap stocks and micro-cap stocks.Demonetization has been a big, big shock to companies earnings and economic growth. The near-term impact is significant. I do not hold out much hope for large caps in terms of their ability to recover quickly. Banks will be the hardest hit as there is no credit offtake and (there is) a slowdown in demand. It may even hit recovery of loans, and even add marginally to non-performing assets.Why are you bullish on small caps and micro-cap stocks?They dont necessarily have to bank on government or strong domestic economic growth per se. Small companies can find a niche area, a good product or they find demand from a specific industry. So, I find many of those attractive bets in small and micro space. Some of those companies have corrected, and valuations are pretty attractive.Where do Indian equities stand vs emerging market peers in 2017?Before demonetization, I was reasonably optimistic on India outperforming emerging markets or at least performing in line with them. India was going to stand a little behind commodity-producing markets, which had rallied on the back of a recovery in commodity prices. There was, however, a good monsoon after two bad years, and consumption was finally looking up. There was general optimism on earnings growth, which has been very tepid in the last few quarters.However, post demonetization, things have turned bad, at least for a few quarters. I think India is now going to lag other emerging markets in 2017.Whatever tepid growth rate we were seeing, that also is in question right now. Also, post a shock like that, while people say it will hurt the economic growth for one or two quarters, the point is nobody knows. Macroeconomics is not arithmetical. It is not like I give x input and y output is delivered. Sometimes, it may happen, sometimes it may not, and sometime a completely un-modelled thing may happen.It is very clear that the economic growth momentum is broken. How does it come back, how much you need to stimulate for it to come back and whether we have the firepower to stimulate that much, we do not know. So, suddenly from being reasonably okay position, we are in a situation where we need to invest hugely to repair the damage.If you are thirsty, you drink a glass of water. But if you are dehydrated, you need to be put on the drip. Now, the stimulus has to be disproportionate to the loss the economy is suffering. Does the government have that ammo?Do you think demonetisation was a wrong move by the government?That is not a call I can take. It is for the government to make these decisions.Do you think there are more negatives than positives from it?If you want to look at it from the lens of politics, I think it is a terrific move. If you look at it from the economic or financial lens, its a very muddled picture. For a government in power, the objective is to win elections at any cost. If this helps them achieve this, I think it is all okay, because ultimately like an asset management companys sole purpose of existence is to gather assets, the sole purpose of a political party is to win elections. Period. Performance etc. are all secondary.The goods and services tax is set to be implemented next year. How do you see things shaping up post its implementation?Even before demonetization, the general consensus has been that there will be a near-term impact of adjustment and understanding of GST on economic growth. There are various factors that come into play when a big change like this is introduced. So, even without demonetization, it would have had a significant near-term impact in terms. Now, post demonetization, we are looking at a double whammy to the economy in the immediate future after its implementation.What is your budget wishlist ?I am not a big budget analyst or a big budget watcher. In my view, Indian budgets are generally fairy tales and I dont believe in fairy tales. I dont waste my time analysing it. I think it is just a statement of intent. I dont listen to what they (government) say, I only watch what they do.Private investment demand has not revived for a long time. What is the missing piece that can help revive this?This government has decided as the Big Brother that I will do the all the spending in the economy because I know better than an individual consumer as to where to spend.So, if you see all the economic auctionsall money flows to the government that obviously gives them the power on how low the pricing for telecom etc. can gothe government has decided the economy belongs to them, and not the citizens; and they will decide how economic gains are spent, not the citizens.As we enter 2017, which sectors do you really like in Indian markets, and which sectors would you avoid?The one sector I will definitely avoid is banks. Banks have been over-owned in India. In such a situation, upside usually gets capped. After demonetization, private lenders will suffer as consumption hits a hurdle. Public sector banks that primarily lend to industries were, as it is, going through bad times. The economic slowdown is going to hurt even more than before.",2016-12-26,oxgZihdWTzj0Ns5iw0SCNN,Shankar Sharma of First Global Securities believes demonetisation will affect larger companies more than smaller ones,00:51,I think India is going to lag other emerging markets next year: Shankar Sharma
0.58,"Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw is the chairperson and managing director at Biocon Ltd, a biotechnology firm. Named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time magazine in 2010, Mazumdar-Shaw is recognized as much for her entrepreneurial expertise as she is for her philanthropy. This year, she became the second Indian to take the Giving Pledge, which encourages billionaires to give away their wealth for social good. In an interview conducted by Bridgespan in partnership with Mint, she explains that her philanthropic efforts are focused on healthcare, and makes a distinction between charity and philanthropy.  Edited excerpts: 
What motivated you to start your philanthropic journey and where did you go for advice?I belong to the breed of first-generation entrepreneurs who have basically created our enterprises with very frugal resources. Being in a field like healthcare, for me as someone who is basically on a mission to make a global impact in terms of affordable access to healthcare, I am very, very concerned about the fact that there are a large number of people in this world who need to have some access to basic rights, whether it is in education or healthcare. This is a huge global challenge which I think every one of us who has been fortunate enough to create the kind of wealth we have created, needs to do something about.Inherently I have a social conscience which my late father inculcated in me. He was not exactly a very wealthy man but he was very concerned about the underprivileged, about the people who didnt have equal opportunities.Can you talk about your portfolio of philanthropic works? You mentioned you work in cancer, and initiated work in diabetes.My philanthropy is largely focused on healthcare and I really want to make a difference to peoples lives. The poor are absolutely neglected and they are abused in many ways, because the system just totally ignores their needs, so I have also sort of allocated some part of my philanthropy funds to primary healthcare. In primary healthcare again, I want to use technology in a big way, because I feel that we have got to leapfrog if we have to make any difference to society. I have helped to create what are called ilaaj (diagnosis) clinics and we use technology to diagnose early so that you can treat early and the outcomes become better.These are experimental times but for me philanthropy is about catalyzing a process. It is not about doing the governments job, which very often the government believes is what philanthropy is. I dont ascribe to that at all. I believe that in philanthropy, there are certain things where you can make a big difference like you know building hospitals where you can actually deliver affordable healthcare. I think the government needs to partner with philanthropists and with corporate social responsibility to experiment with new ideas, and that is a form of philanthropy that can really transform.For you, what has translated from your for-profit experience into your philanthropy?Philanthropy has to be sustainable, and thats why I will make a big distinction between charity and philanthropy. Charity has generally a sort of temporary effect and is about giving fish to a hungry man rather than teaching a person how to fish. Philanthropy changes somebody elses life in a meaningful way.How is new philanthropy different from traditional philanthropy?I think old wealth understands philanthropy and they do have a lot of philanthropic programmes to show for it, like in the case of the Birlas or Tatas. They do have a lot to show in terms of philanthropic outcomes; they have created educational institutes, hospitals and other kind of institutions. New wealth takes time to understand what philanthropy is about, because when you create new wealth, your first immediate reaction is I got to make sure that I keep that wealth for a rainy day.What can be done to stimulate philanthropy in India?Philanthropy is about setting an example and I think many of us first-generation entrepreneurs who have built very successful businesses have come together under the India Philanthropy Initiative (IPI) that Mr (Azim) Premji started. Ratan Tata was also one of the co-conspirators. I would say that many of us who belong to IPI, like Nandan and Rohini Nilekani, are like-minded people when it comes to philanthropy. We all believe that every generation has to create new wealth and the wealth that you have created, a large part of it must go back into making the society better, to make a difference to the ones who have been wronged in the society. Every one of us who has created this kind of wealth in India in recent times has demonstrated a social conscience, whether it is Infosys or Wipro, or Biocon.What advice do you give to the new philanthropists who are early in their journey?I always tell people to ask themselves: where do you think you can make a difference and why do you want to make that difference. New philanthropists tend to feel overwhelmed by the needs of society. How do you decide to focus on certain things and say no to other things?Its not just about being a new philanthropist. Even seasoned philanthropists get absolutely bombarded by requests. Everyone comes with great ideas and how wonderful their initiative is and why you should be helping them. As a philanthropist, you have to be very clear on what you are trying to do. If something that is being done actually aligns with what you are doing, then it is very clear that you can actually help this person. But more often most requests dont quite align with what you are trying to do, so it is very easy to say no. Personally I back ideas where I know that the person is very passionately involved with that initiative because again it is about sustainability. Youve got to have ownership of what you are doing.What can strengthen Indian philanthropy?I believe that investing in incubators and accelerators through an angel investment is also extremely important, provided that you are not looking for a return on that investment and are prepared to reinvest whatever returns you make on such investments. To me as a first-generation entrepreneur I know how tough it is to build a business and to scale it up, so I think philanthropic funds should also help others to build social businesses.What are the things that you do to be able to delegate in your philanthropy?You do need to make sure that you build a philanthropic organization or an administrative cell that really looks at your philanthropy very objectively. In most of my kind of philanthropic initiatives, I have really invested in such a way that I leave it to the investees to really take my philanthropy forward. For instance, at the hospital project, I just leave it to the administration of the hospital to make sure that they leverage what I have given them into a very big opportunity.ALSO READ | Govt policy should make it easier to give: Rohini NilekaniALSO READ | You really want to be doing things that make a difference: Ratan TataThe Bridgespan Group, an adviser and resource for mission-driven leaders and organizations, in partnership with Mint interviewed several philanthropists across India to trace their journeys and share their learningsConversations with Remarkable Givers: India.

The algorithm diagnoses the condition with over 90% accuracy by analysing retinal fundus photographs and will probably eliminate the need for an ophthalmologist at the diagnosis stage. Strangely, nobody, including its creator, knows what exactly the algorithm is looking for in the photographs as the algorithm has trained itself rather than being told what and where to look. 
				   
				Our world is being shaped by the intersection of multiple emerging as well as some entirely new technologies. Self-driving cars, drones and intelligent homes are already accepted as inevitable. In other industries, we might witness a shift to consumerization in energy, i.e. the way that energy is produced and distributed, relying heavily on naturally available sources, new storage methods and intelligent grids. We will see the dawn of an entirely new way of commerce, of transparency and efficiency enabled by technology. One doesnt have to look hard to find examples which show that technology is becoming core and inseparable from innovation in every industry. Artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, the Internet of Things, blockchain and many game-changing technologies are coming of age. At the same time, digital is becoming the de facto approach to buying products, services and experiences. The fast-moving landscape on both sides of demand and supply will make most 10-year predictions seem tame in hindsight.Thanks to its unique vantage point over the last three decades, the Indian IT industry has an opportunity to shape these global forces. It has earned its stripes based on the seemingly unassailable value proposition of cost, scale and quality. It has been successful in constantly reinventing service excellence across a broad range of technology, business processes and engineering services. However, this may no longer be enough. To win in the next decade, the industry may need, in some sense, to be an antithesis of the past. Past winning factors of cost, scale and predictability will need to pivot to value-based, agile and innovative, i.e. be true digital co-partners, while helping customers ruthlessly drive efficiencies in their operations. Innovation in AI and robotic process automation platforms and technologies will play a critical role in helping achieve almost unimaginable levels of automation. Winning in the new paradigm thus implies the need for a significant shift in capabilities, skill sets, delivery models and new relationships/partnerships. Capabilities are shifting from technology based to business solution oriented, skills from generalists to specialists with a broad range of expertise, delivery models from off-shore to agile and as a service based, and stakeholders are shifting from calling only on the chief information officer (CIO) to business, functional and IT. Workforce transformation through upskilling and multi-skilling will be essential in the new landscape. Working in cross-function agile teams, imbibing and practising design thinking will need to become second nature to a large majority of technology workers who have traditionally focused on narrow technical excellence.Developing leading-edge capabilities will require an almost boundary-less approach to developing IP (intellectual property) and solutions through an effective external ecosystema combination of investment and participation in innovation ecosystems such as start-ups, academia and venture capital ecosystems. While thats a lot of change to deal with in a short time frame, it is also an opportunity to create value on a much larger scale. India has a large and growing market for digital products and services and a start-up landscape. Government-led initiatives like Digital India can be real catalysts for the change, providing the impetus to leapfrog in innovation ahead of other, slower- growing economies.It will take a sense of purpose, a pioneering spirit and a start-up culture to realize this vision. At a time when globalization is facing some scepticism and headwinds, the industry can be a beacon of hope, showing the power of ideas, innovation and technology to create economic and social value across borders and without bias. The opportunity is ours to win.Rishad Premji is chief strategy officer and member of the board at Wipro LtdThis is part of a series of articles in Mints 10th anniversary special issue that look at India 10 years from now.

0.57,"New Delhi: British Prime Minister Theresa Mays visit to India last week helped to spotlight Indias importance in India-UK trade as Britain looks to rebalance its commercial links with countries post Brexit, according to Patricia Hewitt, chair of the UK India Business Council. To boost investment, the India-UK CEO forum has suggested that the two governments look at a bilateral tax treaty, Hewitt said. Edited excerpts from an interview:
What are the major takeaways from PM Mays visit?It was very important indeed that PM May made India her first international bilateral destination. And I think that was very well recognised by our Indian friends. That said, two thingsone was that following the referendum on Brexit, India, which was already very important to the UK, is even more important. It has gone further up the Prime Ministers list of priorities. But there was a deeper message. There was I think a real fear on the part of our Indian friends and others in other parts of the world that the referendum meant Britain was turning inwards and even at the risk of becoming protectionist. And I think what PM May said here publicly and privately has put that fear to rest. She has made it very plain that Britain remains open for business and that Britain is not turning its back on Europe but is trying to rebalance its relationships around the world to give more importance to its non-European trading partners. I think there is a much better understanding between the two governments and critically between the two Prime Ministers on how to move forward.There seem to be many stress points in the relationshipwhether it is the Vodafone or Cairn India tax cases or Tatas plans to sell Corus. What is your view?I think the economic relationship is very strong. There are always issues in every bilateral relationship. I would say on the tax issue, of course two years ago there was the hope that those issues would be dealt with and put to rest. The Indian government for various reasons decided that wasnt possible. Those two cases are now in arbitration. They will run their course, there will be a decision. So if you like, its been factored in. At the CEOs forum meeting, there were some very constructive proposals for a possible bilateral tax treaty to create a modern framework, ensure that there is a right climate for investors and we get the maximum amount of capital coming in from the city of London directly into India. It the past, much of this has gone through Mauritius; some of it is going via Singapore now. Actually, lets have a bilateral tax treaty and deal with that issue. So actually, I would say there is less tension. The suggestion on the tax treaty came from the CEOs of both sides.Can you please elaborate a little more on the tax treaty proposal? Is there a timeline for when it should be in place?At this point, its a fairly new suggestion. It is to ensure for instance that investors dont find themselves subject to double taxation. Vodafone Plc is covered by a double taxation treaty with the Netherlands but there isnt one between India and the UK. And that is why so much British investment was routed via Mauritius and Singapore. There was a positive interest in the idea from the Indian (government) side. But bilateral tax treaties dont get negotiated overnight as you know. I think both governments were receptive to the idea.Whats the sentiment among British businesses vis-a-vis India?We recently did a survey of our membersBritish companies with an interest in Indiaand they were very positive about the reforms they had seen in the past two years, about the business environment in India and as a result, 60% of them were saying that they were more likely to increase their investment in India over the next couple of years. And that is a direct result of the improved business environment. When you look at what the Modi government has achieved in less than three years, it is very, very substantialone, the Ease of Doing Business and cooperative federalism.The introduction of GST (goods and services tax) is a major step. The bankruptcy laws, inflation and interest rates coming down, lifting the caps on limits in FDI (foreign direct investments)this is a very long list of achievements in a very short space of time.",2016-11-14,qJVS8NsWdQWDlZyJpQem0M,UK India Business Council  chair Patricia Hewitt on major takeaways from Theresa Mays India visit and investment ties between the two countries,01:30,60% of British firms say they may increase their investment in India: Patricia Hewitt
0.71,"Infosys Ltds December quarter results were in line with Street expectations, which isnt great news because expectations had been running low. Revenues fell 1.4% sequentially to $2.551 billion, largely due to the ramp-down of a large project with Royal Bank of Scotland Plc. (RBS) subsidiary Williams and Glyn.
				   
				While the trouble with the RBS project was already known, it turns out that revenues from some other large clients also fell meaningfully last quarter. Revenue from the top 10 clients fell as much as 9.1% sequentially. The RBS project is estimated to have accounted for about half of that decline, which means revenue from other large customers fell 4.5% sequentially.The company management played this down, saying this was due to the seasonal weakness that is typical of the December quarter. Customers take furloughs and have a lower number of working days at the end of a calendar year.But the companys guidance for the full year and the March quarter doesnt inspire much confidence either. According to analysts at Emkay Research, the annual guidance suggests revenue growth of 0.3-1.8% in the March quarter in constant currency terms, which is lower than the 1.9% sequential growth reported by the company in the corresponding period a year ago.ALSO READ | Infosys cuts full-year revenue guidance againThe company said certain pockets of headwinds and some client specific changes are responsible for the guidance, even though most of the verticals it operates in look set for a bounce-back. Analysts at Nomura Research said in a recent note to clients that improvement in demand for IT services could be lagged and likely to reflect only by 2QFY18. They added that the recovery is not uniform with the US banking and financial services (BFS) sector improving, and European BFS, telecom, retail and healthcare client financials showing soft trends, and that the policy uncertainty on immigration in US/regulation in BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) could keep momentum slow at the start of the year.Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services Ltds December quarter results and related commentary provide little reason for any optimism.

One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.But while higher margins and the better-than-expected profit are welcome, investors are far more interested in growth returning to double-digit levels.

-0.06,"Mumbai: Union Budget 2017s proposals on electoral funding reforms have found favour generally, but the plan to issue so-called electoral bonds is seen as yet another attempt by the government to step on the turf of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
				   
				While all details on electoral bonds are not out yet, heres what is known: a person wishing to donate to a political party can purchase these bonds from an authorized bank using cheques or digital payment methods. These bonds shall be redeemable only in the designated account of a registered political party. To issue these bonds, the government will amend the RBI Act. On the face of it, these bonds look like bearer bonds. These are instruments which are not registered in the name of a specific owner and will pay to whoever bears them.Section 31 of the RBI Act gives power, as of today, to issue bearer bonds to RBI and government. The bearer bond has the characteristic of a currency. That is why the power is not given to a bank, said a senior RBI official on condition of anonymity.The RBI Act states that other than the central bank and central government, nobody can issue notes which have the characteristic of a banknote or a currency note. Hence, the government move to amend the Act to allow commercial banks to issue such bonds is leading to some discomfort among RBI officials who feel it will erode some of the central banks authority.The issue is especially sensitive coming at a time when two former governorsY.V. Reddy and Bimal Jalanhave expressed concern over RBIs eroding autonomy after the government rode roughshod over the central bank while demonetizing high-value currency notes.This will unnecessarily fragment the note-issuing authoritys capacity. The government can do without amending the Act, said a senior banker on condition of anonymity.Such bonds have nothing to do with RBIs authority or autonomy, said an expert in financial markets, but added that they are a bad idea nonetheless. RBI is a creature of RBI Act and if the government amends the Act, RBI will have to comply. I dont see the governments move to issue electoral bonds as infringing on RBIs autonomy, said Ajay Shah, professor, National Institute for Public Finance and Policy.A bearer bond assumes the character of cash. Then there is no difference if political parties are funded by cash or through electoral bonds. It doesnt improve the transparency of the funding process, said Shah.This is not the first time that the government has issued bearer bonds. In 1987, the then government floated a development bond called Indira Vikas Patra, which was issued through post offices. Since this had the characteristic of a bearer bond, it conferred anonymity to the holders of this bond. However, it was finally discontinued after it was suspected that these bonds were used as a conduit for laundering black money.",2017-02-03,r8DNSqB9GJ4BWVJh3WFR4N,"The plan to issue electoral bonds for political funding, as announced by Arun Jaitley in his budget speech, is seen as yet another attempt by govt to step on RBIs turf",01:57,Union Budget 2017s electoral bond proposal raises thorny questions for RBI
0.4,"San Francisco: Juergen Schmidhuber taught a computer to park a car. Hes also showing that same machine how to trade stocks and detect flaws in steel production. Unrelated as these tasks may appear, Schmidhuber thinks a seemingly random training regimen is key to creating artificial intelligence that can solve any problem.
				   
				Schmidhubers AI theories tend to carry weight. In 1997, he co-authored a seminal paper that laid the groundwork for modern AI systems. It introduced a form of memory modelled after the human brain that helps computers make decisions based on context and prior experiences. The concept underpins most modern AI networks. Today he serves as the head of a Swiss AI institute thats proven to be a fertile breeding ground for many of the worlds top experts. The New York Times recently referred to him as a would-be father of AI.ALSO READ | Charting our artificial intelligence futureIn the last couple years, Schmidhuber has been toiling away in relative obscurity on a small venture called Nnaisense SA. As his ambitions grew, the company, whose name is pronounced nascence, raised its first round of venture capital this month. The funding shows that investors are willing to make a bet on Schmidhuber and his big ideathat just as with a child, the more skills Nnaisenses AI acquires, the easier it is to learn new ones.Schmidhuber, a consummate academic, said he decided to raise money partly to guard against the likes of Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Baidu Inc. The big companies came in and tried to hire my best people away, he said. One of the reasons that I had to become an entrepreneur, as well as an academic, was to try to defend that.Creating an all-purpose AI is a steep challenge for any company, let alone one with 15 employees. Nnaisense may not have the vast reams of search data on which Googles machines learn, but it can more nimbly jump from project to project, exposing its digital mind to many different experiences in the process. We always let it learn something new on top of the previous professions, Schmidhuber said. As you are learning new things, you want to make the task more complex.ALSO READ | Reverse-engineering artificial intelligenceSchmidhuber believes that by contracting out the services of his company to a variety of industries, the skills learned from each job will gradually snowball into a system capable of tackling any challenge it faces. Some within the AI community are skeptical of Schmidhubers bullishness. Companies such as International Business Machines Corp. and German start-up Arago GmbH have worked for years on applying AI to various unrelated projects without achieving consciousness. (But Watson has gotten pretty adept at chess and Jeopardy!)Nnaisenses new financier is Madrids Alma Mundi Ventures. Rajeev Singh-Molares, a partner at the firm, said hes optimistic about the startups chances going up against much larger companies. His firm invested $2 million to $5 million, though he declined to specify the exact sum. The big boys and girls have a lot of data, but they dont have this cross-industry datain insurance, banking, automotive, industrial processes and a couple of others, he said.ALSO READ | Securing a digital futureNnaisense recently worked with Volkswagen AGs Audi luxury auto unit to create a miniaturized car able to park itself.

0.9,"Last week, at the Mints 10th Annual Banking Conclave in Mumbai, one question was common for both former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor D. Subbarao and the current chiefs of large India banks: what do they expect from the union budget?
				   
				Subbarao wants the government to stick to the fiscal consolidation path but most bankers (not all) want Indias finance minister to focus on growth, even if that means a slightly expansionary budget. Chiefs of the three biggest state-owned banks also said they would like the budget to take note of the capital requirement of banks.Most analysts say that the government will be able to stick to the target of a fiscal deficit of 3.5% of gross domestic product, or GDP, in the current fiscal year that ends in March and aim for at least 3.3% fiscal deficit for 2018. The government has been diligently lowering the fiscal deficit for seven years since 2012 when the deficit touched 5.9% of GDP.Subbarao feels that even though there could be a slowdown in growth in the wake of the so-called demonetisation exercise, the government should adhere to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act which seeks to institutionalize financial discipline.ALSO READ | Banks eyeing big-ticket reforms in budget: SurveyThe original objective of the Act was to bring down the fiscal deficit to 3% of the GDP by March 2008 but in the aftermath of the global meltdown, the Act was first postponed and later suspended in 2009. A committee headed by former revenue and expenditure secretary N.K. Singh to reconsider reinstating the provisions of the Act submitted its report on 23 January, a week before the presentation of the budget.The report is not in the public domain but people familiar with its recommendations say the N.K. Singh Committeewhose members include RBI governor Urjit Patel and the chief economic adviser to the finance ministry Arvind Subramanianis in favour of fiscal consolidation but not sacrificing growth.While no one can question the importance of keeping the fiscal deficit low, the budget should also focus on reform in the banking industry. Many of the government-owned banks that have around 70% share of banking assets are laden with bad loans and need capital to stay afloat. Indeed, the banking system plays the most critical role in carrying out the governments development agenda but precious little is being done for the banks.ALSO READ | Budget 2017: Government should stick to fiscal targetsBut for them, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, the most ambitious financial inclusion programme ever undertaken in any part of the world, would not have been successful. Till 11 January, some 266.8 million new accounts have been opened and 210 million debit cards have been issued. One-fourth of such accounts still do not have any money in them but post-demonetization, the collective balance in such accounts has swelled to Rs69,000 crore. The banking industry also made sure that around Rs15 trillion worth of Rs1000 and Rs500 notes have come back to the system in 50 days in the biggest ever currency swap programme in the world.In his address to the nation on 31 December, a day after the banks closed the currency swap window, respecting the autonomy of the banks, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed to them to move beyond their traditional priorities, and keep the poor, the lower middle class, and the middle class at the focus of their activities. He announced cheaper home loans for the poor, 30 million debit cards for farmers, doubling the amount of loan (taken from banks as well as non-banking finance companies) to be underwritten by the government and higher fund flow to the small industrial units, among other things. The budget may have many more such schemes for rural development and employment generation but we need a healthy banking system to implement such schemes.ALSO READ | Budget 2017: Ten things to look out forThe RBIs December Financial Stability Report has pointed out that the gross non-performing loans of the Indian banking industry rose to 9.1% in September 2016 from 7.8% in March, pushing the overall stressed loans to 12.3% from 11.5% and it will rise further. While these reflect the health of the industry, the state of affairs in the public sector banks is far worse. Their stressed loans are at least 16%, more than three times than that of private banks. In fact, the report has said that the public sector banks may record the highest bad loans and lowest capital adequacy ratio, a measurement of capital against risk-weighted assets, among all banks. Has the government done anything meaningful to address these issues?The government had held an offsite with the banking bosses, Gyan Sangam, in Pune, in January 2015. Addressing the bankers, Modi had said it was a unique initiative and the first step towards catalyzing transformation. In August 2015, finance minister Arun Jaitley announced the grand Indradhanush planthe solution to the problems of the industry, which Modi explored in Gyan Sangam. It promised to tackle several critical issues, including appointments, capitalization, stress in the system, empowerment, accountability and governance reforms to revamp functioning of the government-owned banks.Estimating the capital requirement between fiscal year 2015 and 2019 at around Rs1.8 trillion, assuming 12-15% growth in bank credit, the government has committed to pump in Rs70,000 crore in phases till 2019 when the new Basel norms kick in. It also feels that the public sector banks (PSBs) market valuations will improve significantly following governance reforms, tight bad loan management and risk controls, significant operating improvements and, of course, capital allocation in successive budgets. Higher valuations, coupled with sale of non-core assets as well as improvement in performance would enable these banks to raise money from the market, the government had said.It also issued a circular that said there would be no interference from the government and the banks would be encouraged to take their decisions independently, keeping the commercial interest of the organization in mind.A government note describes the Indradhanush framework for transforming the PSBs as the most comprehensive reform effort undertaken since banking nationalisation in 1970 adding, Our PSBs are now ready to compete and flourish in a fast-evolving financial services landscape. If indeed setting up of the Banks Board Bureau with a string of vague and ambiguous terms, splitting the top post in PSBs between chairman and managing director and CEO and appointing a few private sector bankers as heads of PSBs are meaningful reforms, then Indradhanush has done wonders.Even though the credit growth has been far lower than what has been estimated, the banks would need higher capital as growing bad assets are eating into their capital but none has any idea whats happening on that front. The banks are required to set aside money or provide for their bad assets and that erodes their capital.As far as the Banks Board Bureau is concerned, I wonder whether even the members of the Bureau themselves know what they are expected to do. Its mandate includes selection and appointment of managing director and CEOs as well as non-executive chairman of PSBs, helping banks develop a robust leadership succession plan for critical positions, advising the government on the formulation and enforcement of a code of conduct and ethics for bank executives, and helping banks develop business strategies and capital raising plan, among others.Barring the top level appointments, all other assignments are vague and even here, the Bureau does not have the final say. One-fifth of Indian Overseas Banks loans have turned bad and it has recorded losses for six successive quarters till December (to the tune of Rs5,786.63 crore) but it doesnt have either the chairman or a managing director and CEO for seven months since its last boss retired in June 2016. Apparently, the Bureau recommended the executive director of a PSB for this position and it was cleared by the vigilance authoritya necessary precondition for any top appointment in a PSBbut a division of the finance ministry shot it down. Clearly, there is a disconnect between the ministry and the Bureau.The Bureau also recommended nine candidates for the posts of executive directors in various PSBs in September, but none of them has been appointed as yet. Moreover, it does not have the power to appoint the so-called non-official directors at boards of PSBs, many of whom are the root cause of mis-governance in banks.The governments plan to dilute ownership in IDBI Bank has also gone nowhere. Similarly, the employee stock option plan or ESOPs for PSBs remains a promise on paper so far.In sum, barring a few cosmetic changes, nothing significant has been done to revive the public sector banks. I would love to see finance minister Arun Jaitley using this budget to move forward with a concrete reform agenda.

-0.05,"Sydney: When Indias Tata Motors bought Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford in 2008, many investors thought then-chairman Ratan Tata was making a big mistake.
				   
				Ford was selling the units for less than half what it paid to acquire them, just as early tremors of the credit crisis began sapping luxury demand. The day before the deal was announced on 3 January, 2008, West Texas Intermediate crude reached $100 a barrel for the first time, suggesting a tough environment for gas-guzzling sports cars and four-wheel drives.Tatas Nano, a super-cheap one lakh rupee ($1,500) minicar pitched at Indias emerging middle class, was seen as the best prospect, and Jaguar Land Rover looked like an expensive distraction. Moodys and S&P both downgraded Tata Motors, and the stock fell almost 30% in the six months it took to complete the transaction.How have those prognostications turned out?Wrong on almost every count. Jaguar Land Rover now accounts for more than half of Tata Motors unit sales, overtaking the trucks and passenger cars produced by Tata Motors India in the past two quarters, according to annual results released Monday.Helped by a weakening rupee, Jaguar Land Rovers British-pound-denominated sales have risen more than fivefold since the takeover to Rs.2.24 trillion ($33.3 billion) in the year through March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tata Motors Indias are up a relatively modest 74%.Jaguar Land Rover is also more profitable, even after one-time costs of £224 million ($329 million) during the fourth quarter related to Takatas airbags recall and damage from the 2015 Tianjin chemicals explosions. Operating margins averaged 11% over the past five years, versus 1% in the domestic business.Hows the much-hyped Tata Nano doing? Not so well. With sales rarely rising above 2,000 units a month, the Gujarat-based factory that was set up to build it is only running at about 10% capacity. Like the netbook computers that were launched around the same time and likewise failed to change the world, its entry-level pricing couldnt quite compensate for quality that was also a bit bargain basement.Tata Motors India is now focusing its attentions on the stronger mid- and high-cost vehicle segments, and has revamped the Nano with a Rs.1.99 lakh starting price. Spare capacity in the Gujarat plant will be used to make its new Tiago, which costs Rs.3.2 lakh and upwards.What should Ratan Tatas successor Cyrus Mistry do about this situation? One option sure to delight investors would be selling the legacy Tata business to focus entirely on Jaguar Land Rover, as canvassed by Gadflys Andy Mukherjee in March. The problem there is finding a buyer for an unprofitable arm thats also more indebted than its upmarket stablemate.A better idea would be to make the best of a bad job and work at applying lessons learned from the British business. As Nissan has shown since its 1999 alliance with Renault, troubled carmakers are often only a few blockbusting designs away from success. Many investors nowadays regard Tata Motors India as an irredeemable basket case thats lurched from one crisis to another for decades. They thought the same thing of Jaguar Land Rover eight years ago.

0.73,"Just when you think Bharti Airtel Ltd already has all the mobile spectrum it needs, the company goes ahead and buys some more. Last Friday, it announced it will pay Rs.3,500 crore to buy spectrum in the 2300MHz band from Aircel Ltd in eight telecom circles. This is less than a month after it agreed to pay Videocon Telecommunications Ltd Rs.4,430 crore for spectrum in the 1800MHz band in six circles. The spectrum in both these bands is suited for fourth-generation (4G) telecom services.
				   
				Growth for telecom companies is already being driven largely by the data segment; in Bhartis case, voice revenue has declined on a year-on-year basis in the past three quarters. In this backdrop, it makes sense to have adequate spectrum to support efficient data services.Analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd point out in a note to clients, With this deal, Bharti will have 490MHz of broadband (3G+4G) spectrum on aggregate basis across the 22 circles, versus 486MHz of all 4G spectrum owned by Jio. Bharti now has 4G-spectrum (i.e. 1800MHz or 2300MHz) in all 22 circles, and both 1800/2300 frequencies in 13 circles.Besides the wide coverage, spectrum trading has opened a new avenue for purchasing the hitherto scarce asset. In spectrum auctions, the only avenue available earlier, companies often ended up bidding up prices to extremely high levels. After adjusting Aircels spectrum valuation for its remaining validity of roughly 14.5 years, Bharti Airtel has ended up paying around 10% higher than the reserve price set by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.If Bharti had let the opportunity pass and waited for the auctions, it may have had to shell out a substantially higher amount. JM Financials analysts say, We now expect Bharti to focus primarily on filling up its 2100 (3G) and 1800 (4G) gaps in the next auction; reduced competition for 2300 augurs well for other 4G-contenders like Idea/Vodafone. Of course, the deal is a win-win for Aircel as well; this helps it reduce its debt by about one-fifth, according to news reports.While the deal augurs well for Bharti in the long run, investors must note that the benefits may not be visible anytime soon. As it is, the pace of data subscriber additions has slowed, calling to question the large investments on this segment. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltds launch later this year could put a spoke in the wheel as well.Even so, these are early days of consolidation and, eventually, subscribers may veer towards telecom operators who provide the best service. If Bharti is able to put all of its spectrum to good use and provide quality voice and data connectivity, its investments can result in substantial returns.",2016-04-11,tLnDGcKIgpJu98oSreWSxL,"If Bharti Airtel had let the opportunity pass and waited for the auctions, it may have had to shell out a substantially higher amount

0.78,"London: Tata Sons interim chairman Ratan Tata was on Sunday hailed as the saviour of the UK steel industry after the Tata Group announced a 10-year commitment of £1 billion investment to save thousands of jobs for its embattled steelworks in the country last week. 
				   
				In a special feature titled Man of Steel, the Sunday Times attributes the thousands of jobs saved in the industry largely to the sacking of Cyrus Mistry and Ratan Tata stepping in as interim chairman. Last weeks abrupt change of heart owes much to a terse board meeting in Mumbai on 24 October. At that meeting the board of Tata Sons, the parent company that sits astride an empire spanning steel to tea, sacked its chairman Cyrus Mistry and reinstated his predecessor Ratan Tata, the report said. Describing Ratan Tata as the architect of the £6.1-billion acquisition of Corus in 2007, it quotes insiders as saying that the 78-year-old tycoon was never comfortable with the idea of abandoning Tata Steels Welsh plant at Port Talbotthe UKs largest steelworks. Now he is back at the helm, Port Talbot has won a reprieve, it notes. Tata is said to have been painfully aware that the closure of Port Talbot would devastate the town already marred by poverty. As the head of the (Tata company) charity, Ratan is not like that. You dont want to get rid of vast chunks of people and create mass unemployment. Ratan was quite upset at the way he (Mistry) was dealing with Tata Steel. There were all these whispers that he (Ratan) did the wrong thing in buying Corus, the newspaper quotes an insider as saying. Nearly 11,000 British workers at Tata Steel have been rejoicing after the company has indicated that it would not take any dividends from its British plants until their profit tops £200 million a year. The company made the pledge last week as part of a plan that will keep the Port Talbot site in south Wales open until at least 2021. It promised no job cuts for five years and to pump £1 billion into its UK plants over 10 years. Tata said in a statement, The immediate target of £200 million provides sufficient funds to invest in the business and to manage working capital needs.

0.76,"For a week in May, some of Instagrams designers, engineers and product managers met not at the companys Menlo Park, California, headquarters but at a rented house, stocked with grocery store snacks. 
				   
				There, away from computers and armed with pencil and paper, they explored a question important for the photo-sharing apps future: how do we get our users to shop? In particular, they wanted to figure out how to introduce shopping tools without making them so obvious that they would transform the app into a splashy catalog. Together they came up with 150 ideas. After an extensive process of elimination, the team settled on the design being unveiled this week: letting brands tag products in their photos, the way users tag their friends. Tap on the tagging descriptions to get more information, tap again to buy on the retailers site. Its the first test from Facebook Inc.s Instagram to kick off a broader strategy for helping people pick out and buy things, according to James Quarles, Instagrams vice-president of monetization. The team will gather data from users behaviour to figure out what to do next. Maybe theyll add a way to comparison shop, a way to search for products elsewhere on the app or even a Pinterest-like feature to save posts that inspire, he said. We are so well-positioned in this space, Quarles said. Instagram is super visual, we have a well-defined graph of your interests based on what youre following, and the serendipity of discovery happens every day through the ad products and who you follow.People have long been shopping on Instagram without a formal way to buy things. A crop of influencers on the photo app push fashions into popularity. Company researchers have noticed that users take screenshots of products they love, or direct-message them to themselves. But, like the design teams caution suggests, making shopping an actual app feature is a risky proposition.The main problem: shopping hasnt worked well in social media. Facebooks history is peppered with discontinued e-commerce products, like birthday gifts for friends and Facebook credits, which was a virtual currency for social games. The company recently introduced a Marketplace product that allows people to buy and sell to each other, but its launch was quickly marred when users started posting ads for drugs, sex and exotic animals. Twitter tested a buy button for more than a year, but the project faded and the head of e-commerce departed. Pinterest made a bigger investment in shopping, allowing direct buying on its site from thousands of retailers, but its still unclear how popular the tool is with consumers. Quarles said Instagram aims to learn from all these experiencesespecially from its parent company, Facebook, which has shared its notes. Instagram already lets retailers promote products in ads, but the shopping update would apply to regular posts, making it a more natural experience a more natural experience for users. The apps e-commerce ambitions are largeincluding international expansion and a video version of the productbut theyre starting small. Its testing its new feature with just 20 brands, including Kate Spade and Warby Parker, and not taking any cut of the proceeds.For J. Crew, which is one of the test brands, Instagrams product fills a gap in mobile shopping. For one, its image-based, which makes it much more amenable to inspiring people to buy products than Facebook, according to Jenna Lyons, J. Crews president and creative director. It has the opportunity to take a customer from the point theyre interested in a product to actually making a purchase. Its happening in the real world already, she said.Its been a little frustrating to us in the past to not be able to have people purchase on Instagram, Lyons said. Not only has it become a place for people to get influenced by their friends, but theyre walking into our stores with their phones and saying, do you have this?She is hoping the test will show that Instagrams method is subtle enough to not turn people away, but powerful enough to drive people to J. Crews site. I really hope it works, Lyons said.

Google software now runs on 85% of the worlds smartphones, but as voice control threatens to replace touch as the primary means of using a hand-held device, the company is experimenting with a different approach  more akin to Apples tight integration of hardware and software.The Pixels hardware and Assistant teams gather for happy hour every on Friday and have already received a prototype for the camera on next years phone, said Brian Rakowski, vice president of product for Googles Android operating system. Their ambition: to make the companys voice-powered digital assistant better than rivals such as Apples Siri and Microsoft Corps Cortana.We really wanted the Assistant on the phone to feel like a natural extension of the ways you ask Google for information, Rakowski said in an interview. Leaf from Apples book The fusion of hardware and software is key to that goal. Certain specifications are crucial for a high-performing assistant, such as a well-placed microphone and a powerful processor to crunch reams of data.Creating an app isnt enough; that requires a few clicks for users to get to it. The hardware and software teams worked closely on details such as the graphics that appear when users call up the assistant, settling on a flurry of colourful dots, which Rakowski called a whimsical touch to give a little bit of life to the home button. The Assistant is always at the ready on the Pixel phone and can be summoned by pressing the home button or saying the words OK Google.By integrating the Assistant into the Pixel, Google doesnt have to do negotiations with another handset maker  they can make it as tight as they want, said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, which offers a digital assistant by the same name.To make sure users get the best possible experience, the Assistant will live only on Google products such as the Pixel, at least for now.In the long term, however, it is unclear whether Google will keep it that way, or return to its original phone strategy and try to push the product out to the millions of smartphones running on other manufacturers Android phones, at the risk of offering a slightly lower-quality experience. Rakowski said making sure the Assistant works well on other phones would require a close level of integration with handset makers, beyond the typical work that happens on the Android operating system.We want all these features of the Assistant to work well and work quickly and be nicely integrated so it gives the right idea of what the Assistant can do, he said We dont want it to feel limited or bolted on in any way.He admits it could be challenging to execute the Assistant on some current Android phones.You cant do some of the always-on OK Google detection on some phones because they dont include the right hardware to do that, he said. In some cases, the microphone is not in a great position.Samsung going it alone?Whatever Google decides, there are already some signs that its Assistant may not be welcome on all Android phones. Samsung Electronics Co, the worlds top selling smartphone maker and the leading Android manufacturer, recently acquired Viv Labs, an artificial intelligence startup founded by the creators of Siri, and plans to weave the assistant into its phones. Having already ceded their operating systems to Google, Android manufacturers may be reluctant to delegate the digital assistant as well, people in the industry said.If we get to the point where the face of the brand is the assistant itself, that is totally a differentiator, said Babak Hodjat, co-founder of artificial intelligence company Sentient. They will be relegated to just pushing hardware. Google is coy about its plans. Over time, we want to bring the Assistant to as many people as possible, Steve Cheng, product management director for the Assistant, said in an interview, without giving details. Analysts expect that eventually Google will try to make money by taking a share of transactions brokered by the Assistant  such as when a user buys flowers from a store the Assistant just located. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai appeared to hint at that possibility during the companys earnings call on Thursday.The Assistant team talked about conversational actions as a way by which we can integrate third parties into the voice experience, he said. But he did make clear, whether on its own or others hardware, the shift from touch to voice-controlled assistants presents a prime opportunity for Google. As we went from desktops to mobile, its not like one replaced the other... It expanded the pie, he said. I approach this the same way.  Reuters",2016-10-29,uZTypcSENAEbzboSMPJD3I,"To make sure users get the best possible experience, the Assistant will live only on Google products such as the Pixel, at least for now",13:09,Google tries new approach with voice on Pixel phone

What is it? The approximate number of companies that had contended the right of states to impose entry tax (levy on movement of goods from one state to another).Why is it important? The Supreme Court on Friday ruled against these companies and upheld states rights to levy entry tax and said that this did not violate the principles of free trade. According to estimates, companies would have to reportedly pay Rs30,000-Rs35,000 crore in entry tax to states. The government is trying to roll out the goods and services tax, which is to subsume all indirect taxes (including the entry tax) in the country, by 1 April 2017 but this could be delayed by another six months.Tell me more: Companies including the Jindal Group, Vedanta, Tata Steel and Steel Authority of India had argued that the imposition of the entry tax by states on the movement of goods into their respective territories was against the right to freedom of trade and commerce in India, which is guaranteed under Article 301 of the Constitution.Rs2,500What is it? The cash withdrawal limit at ATMs per day, up from Rs2,000, as per a government notification.Why is it important? One of the consequences of the shock announcement of withdrawal of old currency notes in Rs500 and Rs1,000 denominations by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday has been the long queues outside bank branches and ATMs. The governments apparent lack of preparedness at dealing with the moves aftermath has been criticised and there have been instances of daily wage labourers losing out on their livelihoods, low-income workers struggling to get their hands on cash due to not having bank accounts or means/awareness to transact digitally.Tell me more: After a review by the finance ministry, the limit of old notes of Rs500 and Rs1,000 that can be exchanged with new notes of Rs2,000 and Rs500 have been increased from Rs4,000 to Rs4,500 per day. The weekly limit of withdrawal from bank accounts has been hiked to Rs24,000 from Rs20,000 and the limit of Rs10,000 has been removed.6What is it? The number of years of negotiations to arrive at a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement between India and Japan signed during Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit to Japan.Why is it important? This will help India buy nuclear technology from Japan and for Japan, it is its first civilian nuclear pact cooperation with a country (India) that has not signed the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. However, this exception has been made by Japan reportedly due to a separate note that says that it would suspend nuclear cooperation with India if it conducts a nuclear test, though unnamed Indian officials have insisted that this is not legally binding but only included keeping in mind Japanese sensitivities. This has raised apprehensions that this may lead to re-negotiations with other countries with whom India has signed nuclear pacts to insert similar clauses.Tell me more: Another clause in the note reportedly says that if Japan scraps the deal in the event of India conducting a nuclear test, the latter cannot ask for compensation for disruption of electricity from a nuclear plant or for the resultant economic losses. Japan is the only country to have suffered the impact of nuclear weapons being dropped on it and, therefore, has been uncomfortable signing such a pact with India, which is outside the nuclear non-proliferation regime.0.2%What is it? The expected increase in global carbon emissions above the 2015 levels from fossil fuels and industry in 2016, according to a study.Why is it important? This is the third straight year with an almost flat growth rate and a significant decline from the 3% recorded in the 2000s. One of the main reasons for this could be attributed to a decline in emissions by China and the US, the two largest emitters. Emissions by China and the US are expected to decrease by 0.5% (from 0.7% in 2015) and 17% (2.5% in 2015) this year, respectively. However, researchers said it is too early to say whether this is a temporary blip or the making of a long-term trend.Tell me more: Indias emissions, which were growing by 6% per annum over the last decade, slowed down to 5% in 2015 and such levels are expected to continue as it expects to double its coal production by 2020.$40.85 billionWhat is it? Asset sales by Indian companies pending or completed in 2016.Why is it important? This is the highest-ever asset sales by companies since liberalisation in 1991 and around 46% higher than the previous high of $27.96 billion recorded in 2007. This could be one of the main reasons why private investment has been muted in the recent past. While the 2007 asset sales were due to investors wanting a bigger pie of Indias growth story (its economy grew by 9% or more between 2005-06 and 2007-08), 2016 asset sales are due to the high debt levels of corporates.Tell me more: Some of the deals in 2016 include sale of controlling stake in Essar Oil to Russias Rosneft and its partners for nearly $13 billion and sale of Jaypee Groups cement assets to Aditya Birla-controlled UltraTech Cement for around $2.4 billion.howindialives.com is a search engine for public data",2016-11-14,uhljG1EgkoKTaCSia10yCP,"In other news, $40.85 billion is the highest-ever asset sales by companies since liberalisation in 1991",11:30,"News in Numbers | New withdrawal limit from ATMs is Rs2,500 per day "
0.17,"New Delhi: Putting speculation to rest, filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali joined hands with Viacom18 Motion Pictures for his epic project Padmavati in October. Scheduled for a 17 November, 2017 release, the estimated budget of the Ranveer Singh, Shahid Kapoor and Deepika Padukone-starrer is around Rs180 crore, making it one of Indias most expensive movie productions, said trade experts who declined to be named. About Rs150 crore has been set aside for production and the remaining for promotions, advertising and other expenses.
				   
				Media reports in the past two months suggested that the film would mark the unique collaboration of two major Bollywood corporate housesEros International that had backed the previous two films directed by Bhansali, Bajirao Mastani and Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela, and Viacom with which he had co-produced Mary Kom and Gabbar Is Back. But Eros backed out of the deal in October, industry experts say, because of a financial crunch. Eros International Plc.s stock has fallen since August this year. Its shares, as of Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, reads last traded at $18.13 apiece, down from $19.23 apiece on 8 August . Bombay Stock Exchange listed Eros International Media Ltd stock witnessed a sharper fall in the same period, falling to Rs176.90 on Friday from Rs230 apiece on 8 August. Padmavati is the second film that Eros has let go of recently; it earlier backed out of Ajay Devgn-starrer Shivaay, which also had a budget of over Rs100 crore. The studio declined to comment for this story.The deal makes sense for Viacom despite the massive budget, say trade experts. For one, it involves Bhansali, who is riding high on the Rs184 crore net box office collections of Bajirao Mastani. A director is always assured a budget equal to the recovery that his last film made. The challenge is to go beyond that and there is always about 10-20% risk for the studio involved, said Jayantilal Gada, chairman of film-producing and presenting company Pen India. Plus with him (Bhansali), its a case of take it or leave it. Look at any of his films and you can see the money spent on every scene, they are all meant to be big screen experiences.To be sure though, in absolute terms, Padmavati will have to equal the Rs500 crore plus gross collections of war epic Baahubali: The Beginning to recover the investment, said Atul Mohan, editor of trade magazine Complete Cinema, given obstacles like rising ticket prices and rampant piracy in the movie business.He is a very sensible director and you definitely need these larger-than-life films once in a while to provide variety for audiences. But the Indian box office is highly unpredictable and a big-budget film gone wrong can totally break a studio as the examples of Mohenjo Daro and Bombay Velvet show, Mohan said. Viacom shelled out about Rs40 crore for the satellite rights of Bhansalis Bajirao Mastani. The Rs150 crore production budget for Padmavati means that Viacom will spend about Rs75 crore from its own funds and the remaining will come as loans from banks. A mere Rs35 crore extra would give them rights to a Bhansali film that would, as most people agree, stand a class apart. Plus there are a variety of revenue streams available for Viacom to recover its investment in Padmavati.Earlier films were dependent on theatrical, music and satellite rights for earnings. Now there is such a huge revenue proposition in the form of digital apps, every mobile is a shop now, said Sanjay Bhandari, a financial adviser to the film industry.Viacom especially stands to benefit thanks to its video-on-demand service Voot, a joint venture with Reliance Industries Ltd, which in September launched its telecom operation. The studio remained unavailable for comment.Producers arent just looking at recovery on the table now, at least 30-40% of the recovery happens after the release. The lifespan of movies has gone up tremendously and I see this as a reasonable deal, Bhandari said.",2016-11-11,w5SiHLkpSzefzhtC0e2nuJ,The Rs150 crore production budget for Padmavati means that Viacom will spend about Rs75 crore from its own funds and the remaining will come as loans from banks,19:42,Why the Rs 180 crore Padmavati deal may work for Viacom

HCL had earlier this year appointed Vijayakumar as chief operating officer, signalling a transition at Indias fourth-largest information technology firm where growth has slowed in the past few quarters. 
				   
				Vijayakumars challenge will be to bring HCL back on the growth path and fill the void left by former CEO Anant Gupta. Edited excerpts from an interview:What will be your focus area as the new CEO?One very important thing that we have articulated to the market is our Mode 123 strategy. This is all about how we can map the customer spend and fine-tune our services to make it relevant to the spend. We have mode 1 services which are traditional services such as infrastructure, application, engineering services and BPO (business process outsourcing). These are momentum services and we believe these markets are still under-served. Only 49% of global 2,000 companies have outsourced. Then still there are a lot of re-bid opportunities, $150 billion worth of re-bid is on and year on year its $40-50 billion. Its a big opportunity.You have made niche acquisitions such as those of Volvo for automotive and Butler America for aerospace. Are you more focused on gaining technology instead of acquiring customers?We want to focus on intellectual property (IP). If you want to future-proof your business, I think products and IPs are very important, so whether you can overnight build products and IPs of very high valueno. By this partnership and niche acquisitions, we will start building it in the long term. I think its really a very important strategy for us.Are you planning to appoint a new head of the infrastructure business, and will the COO position be filled?Its something I have to think about. Its too early. But we have a very strong leadershipsales leaders, delivery leaders and HCL has always boasted of strong leadership pipeline. I think, I am pretty comfortable with the momentum and we are pretty optimistic for the overall outlook.So, can I say that the COO position was created to help you transition to the CEO post?You can take it like that. It was a part of succession planning.You have chalked out a partnership with IBM. What gains are you expecting from this, considering that IBM is also a competitor?Competition is in certain space. In the IT space, there are lots of opportunities. They have a huge software business. So, there are good IPs that can be potentially looked at and thats what we have done. And then they are also a very large PaaS (platform-as-a-service) provider, like Bluemix is a big PaaS service. Some of our modern applications can be built on Microsoft Azure or IBM Bluemix.You have been defocusing on the India market. Will that continue?Yes, we are not focusing on the India market. It will continue to come down.With a 2.8% quarterly growth and a soft second half, will you be able to achieve the 12-14% target in 2016-17?We had a 6% revenue growth in the first quarter, we have 2.8% in the second quarter, so we are clear on what the run rate is. It is between 2% and 3% to get to the 12-14%. So far, from whatever we know, we feel confident to achieve that target.While many IT peers have hired outsiders in order to transform themselves, you are a 22-year company veteran. Do you feel confident to bring new ideas?Each core business has got very strong leadership. We continue to hire from outside also. So, it gives a good mix of external and internal view. In a large company, to really drive, you need to understand the internals of the company. You need to understand what is the market positioning of the company, who are your customers and where you are resonating well.

0.09,"Large state-run lenders are seeking to break away from the system of negotiating periodic, industry-wide wage settlements with the unions and decide their own pay structures.
				   
				Lenders such as State Bank of India (SBI) and Punjab National Bank (PNB) are exploring the idea of moving to a variable pay structure, which will be based on the performance of employees.SBI is looking to introduce an employee stock ownership plan and grading system based on an employees performance, said a senior SBI official on condition of anonymity. PNB plans to approach its board with a proposal to introduce performance-based pay for all officials above the level of chief manager.Today, an employees salary is predictable. There is a need to recognize performance and give remuneration. We have formed an internal committee of general managers to work on this matter and submit the proposal to the board, Usha Ananthasubramanian, managing director and chief executive officer of PNB, said at an analysts meeting, after the lenders earnings announcement.Usha also added that PNB had earlier tried to move to a variable pay structure for all employees under the chairmanship of K.C. Chakrabarty, but failed in its attempt.PNB ran up Rs1,967.16 crore in employee costs for the quarter to September, up from Rs1,877.56 crore a year ago. SBIs staff expenses rose to Rs6,257 crore from Rs5,906 crore in the same period.Banks are discussing moving to their own pay structures after the finance ministry asked them to start the process for the 11th bipartite wage pact before the current five-year settlement expires in October 2017.The ministry has asked banks to start early, instead of waiting for the culmination of the current wage pact, an official with the Indian Banks Association (IBA), which groups all banks in India, said on condition of anonymity.As large banks explore the idea of moving to their own pay structure, a few smaller ones including Union Bank, Syndicate Bank and Vijaya Bank have sent their consent to IBA to be a part of the process for negotiating a new wage agreement, added the official.The transition to a productivity-linked settlement is easier said than done. Such a move will face stiff resistance from bank employees unions, which are used to a uniform wage hike.We will oppose a variable pay structure if banks go ahead and introduce this system. We are for more efficiency and productivity, but we dont want differentiation in salary, said C.H, Venkatachalam, general secretary of the All India Bank Employees Association. Bank employees unions have, meanwhile, started preparing a charter of demands that will be submitted to IBA by January 2017.We are looking at an adequate hike in salary this time, in conformity with rising inflation. We are also looking at a higher starting salary for attracting new talent, special facilities for women and improvement in post-retirement benefits, said Venkatachalam.Around one million bank employees across public sector banks, old private sector and a few foreign banks are part of the industry-level wage settlement.According to the 10th bipartite wage settlement, banks and unions agreed to a 15% hike in wages, which resulted in an outgo of Rs5,000 crore for the system. Also agreed to were bank holidays on second and fourth Saturdays.Also, PSU banks have been reeling under losses and mounting NPAs and implementing the variable pay structure may be ill-timed. Concept of variable pay structure is sound. It will encourage employees to make the right decision.

0.6,"London:  Ashish Thakkar, who co-founded Africa banking conglomerate Atlas Mara Ltd with ex-Barclays Plc. head Bob Diamond, is a 35-year-old billionaire whose divorce fight has been prolonged, thanks to a complex web of offshore assets. 
				   
				The question of how much Thakkar is worthhe says $541,000 while his wife claims his wealth is far greateris coming under scrutiny in a UK divorce court. A judge in the London family court has denied Thakkars request for a final divorce decree until a determination of his real worth.This is a case where the wife says her husband is a billionaire, judge Philip Moor said in the ruling that shows the difficulty courts have in making a fair assessment of wealth. All the assets are offshore. They are held in very complicated structures that have changed within the recent past. The situation is one where it can be very significant if you are a wife or a former wife.The judges ruling, which was handed down in June and published on the courts website last week, extends a legal battle over the less than five-year marriage that has cast a spotlight on the entrepreneur, whose own foundation has promoted him as Africas youngest billionaire.Financial puzzlesUK judges have become used to unpicking complex webs of offshore assets in high-stakes divorces as spouses sometimes plead net worth far less than what the other spouse claims is their actual fortune. The forensic tracing of assets is a problem that has played out in other scenarios judges have faced across the world from tax avoidance schemes to fraud prosecutions.Based on his disclosed public and closely held assets, Thakkars net worth is valued at $425 million, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His most valuable asset is Ison BPO (Business Process Outsourcing), a UAE-based outsourcing company that operates in Africa and India.Lawyers for Meera Thakkar declined to comment as did a spokesman for Ashish Thakkar. Thakkars lawyers didnt respond to a call seeking comment. In court filings, Thakkar has argued that the beneficiaries of his companies are his mother and sister.While the Thakkar case is at the London high court, similar issues have reached the countrys top court before. The ex-wife of oil trader Michael Prest won a Supreme Court ruling giving her the right to force offshore companies owned by her ex-husband to turn over assets as part of a 17.5 million-pound settlement in 2013. Prests lawyers argued at the time that the courts had no right to pierce the corporate veil of his companies to fund the settlement as they were separate entities and unrelated to the marriage.He was later threatened with up to four weeks in jail for failing to pay his ex-wife 360,000 pounds in 2015 despite his assets being estimated by the judge to be in the region of 37 million pounds.Allegations of hiding assets in divorce cases is nothing new and UK judges have wide discretion to set values as they see fit, according to Graham Coy, a lawyer at Stowe Family Law, who isnt involved in the Thakkar case.If someone is determined to try and hide their assets it is possible, but they could still end up being clobbered in the end anyway because a judge can just take a view on how much theyre worth and if they dont like it, prove it, Coy said.The ex-wife of a property magnate Scot Young told a London judge in one of the highest profile divorce cases in recent years that Young was hiding billions from her while he claimed he was about 28 million pounds in debt.The judge said in the 2013 ruling that Young wasnt a penniless man of straw with huge debts, and that hed hidden from the court about 40 million pounds in assets. Young fell to his death from a fourth-floor window of his flat in London in late 2014.The Supreme Court rolled back two divorce settlements in a 2015 decision that underlined Londons claim to be the divorce capital of the world. The top court ruled two ex-wives are entitled to larger divorce settlements because their husbands hid their true wealth, the decision could pave the way for previous divorce agreements to be revisited many years after they were agreed.Adventures in AfricaThakkars story began in Idi Amins Uganda. His family was among Asian families the dictator expelled in 1972, and moved to the UK, where Thakkar was born. They returned to Africa when he was a child, this time to Rwanda, where his family lost everything during the genocide in 1994, Thakkar says in his 2015 autobiography, The Lion Awakes: Adventures in Africas Economic Miracle.Thakkars own success has prompted him to be branded Africas youngest billionaire. Hes described that way in a 2013 video on a YouTube channel for his charity, the Mara Foundation. He is introduced as that at conferences and asked about it in media interviews.At 15, after the family had returned to Uganda, Thakkar sold a laptop to his dads friend, triggering the realization he could be a trader. His father gave him $5,000 start-up cash, and he started flying to Dubai to buy cheap computer products, which he sold from a tiny shop in central Kampala.He expanded his business by setting up a Dubai-based company. He later started a packaging factory in Uganda and partnered with an Indian Information Technology services company to help them gain entry in new markets across Africa, according to his websites.Thakkar and Diamond met at an event, hit it off and decided that they could start a banking venture together. Thakkar remains a non-executive director with Atlas Mara, which he and Diamond founded with the idea of buying up stakes in banks across sub-Saharan Africa. The company, domiciled in the British Virgin Islands, has raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors through share offerings since 2013.Its important to think big, dream big, but start small, Thakkar says in interviews and speeches. I dont want to bring Silicon Valley to Africa.

-0.06,"Undoubtedly, it was under A.M. Naiks stewardship that Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) earned a pride of place in the Indian equity markets.
				   
				From the time he took over the reins as chairman and managing director in 2003 and until date, L&Ts market capitalization has surged three times to Rs.1.425 trillion. This implies a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25%, which surpasses the 21% CAGR in the MCap index of BSE 100 companies during the period. Not just this. L&Ts stock, which trades at Rs.1,519, is reckoned by analysts, brokers and investors as the best play on the economy.The first major decision in his 13-year old journey at L&Ts helm to sell its cement business to the Aditya Birla group in lieu of the equity stake held by them in the firm, was creditable. For, it marked the end of takeover threats by big industrial groups and established greater employee and public shareholding. It also ended its presence in its only commodity playcement. Importantly, it marked L&Ts transition from a sizeable engineering and cement conglomerate into an indomitable edifice spanning several businesses such as hydrocarbons, heavy engineering, finance and information technology (IT).That said, L&Ts key focus area remains infrastructure, engineering and construction that today comprises about 45% of its revenue, compared with 83% from engineering and construction way back in 2004.Some analysts have been critical of Naiks diversification into unrelated areas such as finance and information technology (IT), though others consider these as cash-accretive businesses that would provide a hedge against economic recession.Proof of this was seen in the companys financial results during the last two years, when profit growth in the infrastructure segment dropped to single digits. Overall profitability got a leg-up from IT and financial services that did well and helped buck an economic slowdown.Again, Naiks decision to enter these businesses can be lauded in that the two recently announced public issues of L&T Infotech Ltd and L&T Technology Services will help unlock shareholder value as the money deployed in these businesses generates good returns.Further, Naik leaves behind a legacy of not just diverse businesses but diverse markets, too. From a pure domestic infrastructure firm a little over a decade ago, L&T is now present in new markets, such as West Asia. Today, almost one-third of its annual order inflows come from overseas, offsetting the slow pace of infrastructure development and order inflows in the country.Of course, in West Asia, the firms timing was perhaps wrong as the crude oil price crash stymied expansions in this region.L&Ts strength lies not just in diversification, but also in attaining size and scale in its businesses, enough to compete well.From FY03 till FY16, L&Ts consolidated revenue has grown at a CAGR of 19% to touch Rs.1.026 trillion. Growth in profit after tax has been even better at 23% CAGR.That said, sustaining fixed costs and overheads in the face of an economic slowdown is challenging. This is mirrored in its operating margin that has slowly started trending lower from 13-14% about a decade ago and is unlikely to improve in the near term.That apart, L&T could boast of a sizeable order book, enough to generate revenue for the next two years. But then, its balance sheet is also weighed down by the same. Economic slowdown and project delays due to tight liquidity conditions among customers has led to a surge in working capital requirements that is one-fourth its net revenue.The change of guard comes with huge challenges, too. Through Naiks tenure, L&T has been unable to churn out profits from some businesses. Its shipbuilding, heavy forgings, hydrocarbons, power and road subsidiaries are either loss-making or have wafer-thin profits.The scene is far from cushy in developmental projects that include roads, ports, bridges and urban infrastructure. For example, the FY16 annual report shows that while its road projects clocked single-digit revenue growth, high interest costs and depreciation translated into losses.The street is also concerned about the Hyderabad Metro project, mired in clearance hurdles and delays. It is likely to bleed once it is fully operational and weigh on L&Ts overall profitability.A Religare Capital Markets report says that decisions of capital misallocations in the recent past may not be addressed in the expected timelines. If so, it would tell on profitability. Meanwhile, analysts feel that FY17 will mirror the full impact of the new accounting (Ind-AS) norms, which could hurt profit growth given the more stringent provisions required.Be that as it may, Naiks successor is faced with the task of precariously balancing the juggernaut, until macroeconomic winds turn more favourable.",2016-09-09,x0cXVktXgElid8CsJZMZpL,"AM Naiks successor is faced with the task of precariously balancing the juggernaut, until macroeconomic winds turn more favourable

Only 15 out of 100 households have access to the Internet, and mobile broadband remains for a privileged few, with only 5.5 subscriptions for every 100 people, according to the WEF. However, India has skipped a generation in telecom technologygoing from no connectivity to over 350 million mobile Internet usersin less than two decades. This needs to be factored in while planning the democratization of digital access in India. 
				   
				The impending growth of digital assets will present India with many unique opportunities to leapfrog its traditional deficit in physical infrastructure. It will help enhance the economic conditions in remote areas, spur new businesses by enabling access for a large number of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), creating a strong digital identity for the country. Above all, digital infrastructure growth can empower the government to embrace and enable innovation, provide resources to help increase agricultural productivity as well as enable improved healthcare access for rural areas, potentially reducing mortality levels. It can also bring financial services to the unbanked rural and underprivileged communities and help fulfil the countrys longstanding goal of education for all. Digital literacy in smaller towns and villages can create employment in sectors such as business process outsourcing (BPO), retail, IT, telecom and financial services. Digital India can also ensure citizens have ubiquitous access to government services. While mobile technology has begun to make a transformative impact, digital access in Internet dark areas, could have a larger socio-economic impact.                                                                                                                              *******While the story of the potential value that Indias digital infrastructure can add, has been told many times, developments in this sector have so far lagged expectations. The governments flagship projectthe National Optical Fibre Network (NOFN)is yet to fulfil its promise for rural India. In this scenario, we continue to trail the worlds major economies in telecom infrastructure maturity and penetration. Network investments by mobile operators are being held back, due to the poor economics driven by low tariffs and a high level of competition. This has hit carriers ability to upgrade consumer services, meet demand in highly populated urban areas and expand networks to provide coverage to rural areas. The next few years could see unprecedented changes in the quantity and quality of digital access. Few would argue against the need for a robust digital infrastructure in India. However, one must realize that the economic barriers to that are very high. The following factors will be key to achieving Indias digital infrastructure dream:Expanding spectrum assets: Few policy changes have a greater impact on infrastructure creation, than optimizing spectrum availability over time by releasing unlicensed spectrum, revising allocations and enabling free sharing and trading. Spectrum is a scarce resource. The ever-increasing projections of mobile traffic growth in India, make a compelling business case for allocating more spectrum for mobile usage. These allocations need to include licensed and unlicensed spectrum bands to accommodate both network coverage and capacity needs. While India has taken a few steps in the right direction such as the department of defence releasing spectrum in the 1,800-2,100 MHz bands, it still needs a better and more comprehensive spectrum policy. India lags behind many developed and emerging markets in per-capita availability of spectrum. Also, the cost of spectrum here is one of the highest in the world. The primary goal for policymakers should be to maximize the use of spectrum, rather than focusing on its short-term value. Also, the more harmonized the spectrum used by mobile operators, the more economically viable the overall solution to improving Internet access. This calls for effective synchronization of Indias spectrum planning, allocation, network design, financing and construction. Also needed is a national policy to enable access densification in areas with low-income but high-growth potential.Creating broadband infrastructure: Let us turn our attention to the resources required for the creation of broadband infrastructure. India currently ranks low in broadband penetration, even among developing countries. Internet access has grown, driven by a higher penetration of mobile handsets and wireless infrastructure in urban and tier I and tier II towns, but  broadband penetration in the larger part of the country is still dismal. Current estimates show that broadband only reaches approximately 600 corridors, largely in and around the top 50-100 Indian cities. On the other hand, the country aspires to create a Digital India with a broadband highway offering a 100-Mbps connectivity to 250,000 gram panchayats. The funds needed to create a national IP backbone and ensure last-mile connectivity have not been supported by a strong underlying business case. The creation of Digital Bharat calls for radical changes to regulatory frameworks, allowing the generation of viable business models for inclusive broadband growth. There is significant public funding involved in making NOFN come true, but private sector operators have so far seen little value in pursuing fiber deployment beyond the top cities. This calls for the creation of robust models of public-private partnership, driven by a combination of rights of way, release of spectrum and creation of a content ecosystem to spur revenue generation via digital infrastructure. Enhancing technology adoption: This is the other side of the story, where industry participants need to get their act together. Over the last few years, new and existing players have made significant investments in transforming the infrastructure for 3G/4G/LTE roll-outs. In a country with relatively low average revenue per user (ARPU), carriers will need to continue focusing on infrastructure build-outs to increase coverage and improve customer service quality. With a large part of the data consumption moving indoors, the industry needs to move towards small cell deployments. White-labelled small cell deployment makes great economic sense for all high-demand concentration centres. Further, developments in software-defined-networking (SDN) and network-function-virtualization (NFV), have the potential to redefine the economies of infrastructure deployment for operators. Virtualization needs to become business-as-usual. This will make infrastructure deployments simpler (commodity hardware with centralized software), more cost effective, agile, reliable (battle-proven commodity hardware) and flexible (digitally defined network topology and functions). These virtualized networks will be at the core of the telecom industrys digital transformation, redefining our infrastructure into a programmable platform for a variety of new services. As an example, business-to-business connectivity business models are already being completely disrupted with software-defined wide area networks.                                                                                                                             *******Ultimately, the economics will work when there is demand for services and development of new use cases. The creation of the content and services stack in remote locations, will be key to drive adoption. There are multiple areas where digital infrastructure can play a big role in creating opportunities. These include public and law enforcement records, health data including patient and insurance records and academic and employment records. Other areas include location services, digital identity including identifiers and demographics, communications and local content. Multiple stakeholders need to come together to create an effective ecosystem of content, services and governance that will increase usage, ultimately creating the business case for a robust public-private investment. But implementation of such initiatives is fraught with constraints related to consumer privacy, ownership of data, data security and protection. Digital India will become a reality only if we can create the data ecosystem required and find solutions to overcome these constraints.Over the next few years, we need to prevent market failures in digital infrastructure creationfailures that are borne out of unfavourable economics and lead to suboptimal development of digital infrastructure and issues in both quantity and quality of digital access. The scale of change required to make this happen is disruptive and unprecedented. For digital infrastructure to take root and flourish in India, all stakeholders will have unique roles to play. For individual business leaders, it will mean overcoming technical, economic and business model-related growth challenges in a transformative way. Ultimately, the combination of public-private funding, progressive government policies and freeing up of spectrum assets will determine whether India is able to fully address the digital divide. The initiative will also hinge upon faster adoption of new, cost-effective technologies by industry players and the creation of compelling business use cases. Now is the time for all stakeholders to come together to transform India into a digital economy.Kanchan Samtani and Sumit Sarawgi are partners and directors at BCG.Twenty-five years after liberalization, and 20 years after it entered India, The Boston Consulting Group collaborates with Mint on a series of articles on what lies ahead for the country over the next 20 years.",2017-01-24,xLnErGf2Mq9xDQYj3VHWmI,The impending growth of digital assets will present India with many unique opportunities to leapfrog its traditional deficit in physical infrastructure,02:55,Building Indias digital highway
0.44,"India remains attractive for foreign investors despite the imminent interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve and UKs decision to leave the European Union, John Woods, chief investment officer for Asia-Pacific at Credit Suisse Private Banking, said in an interview. Edited excerpts:
				   
				In January, you had written that you are neutral about India as the growth and reform potentials are still suppressed by political factors. Has your view changed since then? We are cautiously constructive on India from a fundamental perspective. We know it is one of the fastest growing economies among the major economies. We are positive about its valuations. We think capital inflows into India is likely to accelerate as the focus on emerging markets continues. Thats why we are overweight on India within our asset allocation for the Asia-Pacific region and just recently turned overweight on China as well. We are recommending these two markets to our clients.Some people say the Indian equity market is overvalued.We were looking at the price earnings ratio for the next year, which is at around 16 times. For us, that is not particularly expensive. It is not particularly cheap either. It is fairly priced. The problem seems to be consumer-related stocks are quite expensive and capital consumption stocks are quite cheap. What we would like to see certainly is greater evidence of growth in the manufacturing and industrial sector, greater evidence of capital expenditure and therefore profitability growth. That would paint a more balanced picture of the choices open to investors.What are your growth projections for India?We are looking at GDP growth of 7.8% and 8% for next year. We expect the Sensex to close this year at around 28,500. We got a pretty positive outlook for next year. We are looking at 30,500, equivalent of 10% growth from current level, which would be a record high for the Sensex. We are absolutely positive on the equity story.What makes you so bullish about India?It is the fundamental story relative to the rest of Asia that is actually quite attractive. It has a growth rate most economies will die for. It has quite a positive story on consumer spending, which pretty much the rest of Asia is also seeking to expand as well. The reality is we have a positive forecast for a large number of countries in Asia because we think the emerging markets will continue to benefit from the inflows from developed markets. We have seen evidence of some of those inflows already. 2016 has been a great year for a number of emerging markets, particularly based in Asia. Our forecast is a combination of our views on dollar, on commodity prices, on interest rates and domestic factors as well.So, how will a US Fed interest rate hike change those assumptions?We think the Fed will hike interest rate in December, but we only anticipate one or two hikes next year. In other words, it is going to be a very shallow trajectory. That is pretty positive for emerging markets. It means dollar is likely to stay soft, liquidity continues to seek yield and carry. They will continue to be attracted towards economies like India, which offers both yield and carry. In May 2013, we saw the taper tantrum and we saw foreign investors attack India because it had quite unmarked external imbalance in terms of its current account deficit. Thats corrected quite dramatically since then. Foreign exchange reserves have improved quite substantially since then. The economy itself has got a much better reputation among foreign investors due to the liberalization programme.But what are the risks for emerging markets like India?The risks are focused on unexpected spike in inflation in the US because of rise in commodity prices. Then we have to start repricing the Fed, the US dollar, the term structure of bond yields and that would have quite profound effect because then the US will become the yield and carry story and all the money that were seeking carry and yield in emerging markets will go back. But the important point is we are seeing an end to deflation. The last two years or so, the global economy was hammered by deflation. Chinas latest PPI (producers price index) was for the first time positive in five years. As you know people have been accusing China of exporting deflation to the global economy, that has now ended. So we are seeing more signs of positive inflation, which leads to positive sales growth, improved profitability, improved earnings and a healthier stock market. Thats the kind of virtuous cycle that shapes emerging markets such as India.But do you think Brexit has been priced in completely by the investors?The positive effect of Brexit has certainly been priced in. As you know there were a lot of dooms day predictors. They have been proven wrong. Unemployment is now extremely low, the PMIs (purchasing price indices) are extremely high, the stock exchange is getting higher and higher, sterling itself is a great shock absorber. The UK has one of the highest current account deficits among the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries and 20-30% correction in sterling is a very good way of correcting that imbalance. The medium term implications of Brexit are uncertain. But the UK has a huge trade deficit with the EU. So I cant see it necessarily why it is in the EUs interest to burn its bridges with one of its important markets in the world. So I do think there will be mutually beneficial agreement ultimately because both parties want access to each others markets.The government is exploring ways to deal with the bad loans in public sector banks. Do you think a bad bank will be an effective tool in Indian context?In principle, recapitalizing the banking system through the vehicle of bad bank makes perfect sense. If your banking system is unable to extend credit because it is too focused on repairing its capital adequacy and provisioning for its non-performing loans, then how will the economy grow? How can credit be extended particularly to the manufacturing sector and it is one of the problems facing India right now. So the idea to create a vehicle to recapitalize the financial sector by taking out the impaired assets and thereby improving the quality of the balance sheet clearly is a very good idea. The devil always is in the detail. How do you actually do that? Who takes the hit? Should shareholders pay up or should the government pay up? In China, for example, that was originally done at face value.Do you agree with the IMF assessment that credit is growing at a dangerous pace in China and its economy risks an eventual disruptive adjustment?We dont think there will be a credit event in China over the next year because there is an extremely important national Peoples party congress in October 2017 and it is our view that until that meeting happens, the government will continue to provide support and cushion any downturn in economic growth. We have in fact upgraded Chinas economic growth to 6.5% this year and 6.3% in 2017 (from 6% earlier). So not only do we not see a hard-landing, we actually see some evidence of economic acceleration vis-à-vis our previous forecast.10-India has proposed a BRICS credit rating agency as it thinks the current rating system is quite biased against developing countries. Do you agree? Do you see scope for another rating agency?I think it is a fantastic idea. Any effort to provide independent, impartial view of an operating environment through the rating of individual companies can only increase transparency of a business environment. The problem that comes up is how impartial this rating will be? Can I trust the quality of the rating and that clearly has to take time. Initially, there will be some caution and wait and see attitude among investors whether the quality of this credit analysis replicates other rating agencies. But the big problem that I see is when you have a niche rating agency, foreign investors are unable to make a rating assessment at a global level based on a consistent set of rating methodology.",2016-10-25,y93PTvzUvdnZZYE9ZPmK4L,"Capital inflows into India likely to accelerate as focus on emerging markets continues, says Credit Suisses John Woods",01:27,"Sensex could touch  30,500 points in 2017: John Woods"

0.44,"Mumbai:  It is, said a bewildered employee of Indias biggest company, very un-Tata-like.
				   
				The dynastic business that built a reputation over more than a century for discretion, integrity and fair-dealing has sunk into a public spat of allegations and name-calling. Its directors trade barbs. Its share price is tumbling. And on Friday, executives were jostled in the street while security staff engaged in an unseemly brawl outside Bombay House, the groups revered headquarters.How did it come to this?The drama dissecting Tata Sons, Indias largest industrial group, revolves around Ratan Tata, scion of a family that built an empire so diverse that it writes financial software for Goldman Sachs Group Inc., sells pick-up trucks in Uganda and offers packaged salt to Indian families at Rs.18 a kilo.Two weeks ago, Ratan Tata threw the group into confusion and the public spotlight after the Tata Sons board sacked his successor as chairman, Cyrus Mistry, and wrested back control for the 78-year-old. Neither Tata nor any other board member or major investor has suggested that Mistry financially mismanaged the group. He remains head of many of the affiliate companies, such as Tata Motors and Tata Steel.Instead, Mistrys ouster was the result of growing discontent from Tata, who ran the company for two decades, at what he considered was an undermining of the Tata brand, according to people who have worked with both and asked not to be named because the matter is private.Egos have been bruised, said Harsh Goenka, chairman of RPG Group, another Mumbai-based conglomerate. He said the Tata name stands for humility, humaneness, benevolence, grace and boldness of vision, and it has been dented by the current conflict.Since Mistrys removal as group chairman, Tatas more than two dozen listed companies have lost in excess of $8 billion in market value. Ratan Tata didnt respond to a recent request for an interview.Brand TataTatas adherence to the idea of the brand being a byword for integrity has run throughout his career, according to interviews with more than a dozen people who have worked with him. Banks would routinely do business based on Tatas word, and once he committed to doing something, he would see it through no matter what, said a person with knowledge of some of his deals.When Tata Steel bid for Corus Plc in 2006, it arranged financing with three banks for around $5 billion to $6 billion, said the person, who asked not to be named because the negotiations were private. As the price rose in a bidding war for the European steelmaker, Tata officials found cheaper funding, but would have to pay a break fee with the original banks of about £80 million ($99 million). Some executives tried to negotiate a cheaper release, but when the matter was brought to the attention of Ratan Tata, he insisted the original contract be honoured, the person said.Tatas decision echoes the groups current spat with Japanese telecommunication partner NTT Docomo Inc., which is one of the key battlegrounds in the war of words between Tata and Mistry. Docomo is trying to enforce a London Court of International Arbitration decision ordering Tata Sons to pay $1.17 billion for failing to uphold a contract, signed during Ratan Tatas 21-year period at the helm.A Tata Sons spokesman declined to comment while Mistrys office referred to a 1 November statement on the companys partnership with NTT Docomo.Tata became frustrated at Mistrys seeming reluctance to pay, which reflected on the Tata name, according to people familiar with the case. In an email to the directors after his removal, Mistry said it was the board that has not covered itself with glory, by the way he was dismissed.Family codeBut the Tata family code, rigorously pursued by Ratan Tatas predecessor, the legendary industrialist, aviator and philanthropist J.R.D. Tata, extends far beyond just sticking to your word.J.R.D., whose portrait looked down from the boardroom wall in Bombay House as Mistry was being ousted, made Tata famous for refusing to pay bribes. He founded many of the businesses that are now key units, such as Tata Motors, and funnelled a large chunk of profits to social programs such as Asias first cancer hospital and the Tata Institute for Social Sciences.He handpicked Ratan, the great grandson via his adopted father of group founder Jamsetji Tata, to carry on that family legacy. Trained as an architect at Cornell University, Ratan began on the shop floor in 1962, stoking Tata Steels blast furnaces, before gaining experience in several positions in the group.In 1991, he took over the chairmanship and set about establishing his dominance over group companies, which had become rich and autonomous during J.R.D.s five-decade reign.In the 1990s the Tata Group was ruled by powerful satraps and he very dexterously distanced all of them from their powerful positions and gained total control, said Goenka, chairman of RPG. The one common factor that defines Ratan Tata then and now is that of an astute leader. He eased out Cyrus Mistry from the chairmanship that took India Inc. completely by surprise. If the past was about a loud war cry, the present is about stealth.During his first chairmanship, Tata expanded the company rapidly, often by acquisition, turning a predominately India business into a global group with $103 billion in salesahead of Gazprom and International Business Machines Corp. He also sowed the seeds for many of the groups current troubles, including the purchase of Corus, the venture with Docomo and the ill-fated Nano car project.Since about 2004, with the question of his succession looming, Tata gradually increased his control in the operations of the group, said a person who worked closely with both Mistry and Tata. He took major decisions with less board consultation than previously, the person said.Ratan Tata has always consulted senior executives in all his decisions, including the Corus acquisition, said a Tata official, who asked not to be identified citing company rules.New successorThe eventual choice for a successor was Mistry, the son of one of the biggest shareholders in Tata Sons, his own brother-in-law and a fellow member of the Parsi communitythe isolated followers of Zoroastrianism whose ancestors fled to India from Persia a millennium ago.With Mistry deposed, Tata is back at the helm promising to find a new successor before March. Next month he will be 79.I do not think Ratan Tata has any option other than to hold on to the position that he has taken back, whether he likes it or not, said Kavil Ramachandran, executive director of the Thomas Schmidheiny Centre for Family Enterprise at the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad. In the interest of every stakeholder, he has to take steps to get the situation back on track.While Ratan took the groups products to more than 100 countries, he retained the ethos of his predecessors, that in building a business you are also helping to build India.Nano InspirationThe Nano was inspired by seeing an Indian family riding on a motorbike in the rain. It epitomized Ratan Tatas qualitieshis vision and attention to detail, as well as his stubbornness and reluctance to terminate a key business thats losing money.Tata spent hours with the Nano development team, focusing on getting every detail right for the most anticipated auto release of 2008, said a person who worked on the project. Yet the car was marketed as cheap, a stigma that was reinforced by dealers who had little interest in pushing a low-margin vehicle.When Mistry led the introduction of Tata Motors latest modelthe unfortunately named Zica hatchback, rechristened Tiagohis main concern was how to ensure the car would be profitable, according to the person who worked with both Mistry and Tata, and asked not to be identified as hes not authorized to speak to the media. Mistry talked to staff about what he, and even his children, thought of the marketing campaign and what needed fixing, the employee said.Ratan Tatas vision for the group was a globally diversified and successful conglomerate with some distinctive values, said Rishikesha T. Krishnan, director and professor of strategic management at the Indian Institute of Management Indore. Cyrus Mistry did not dismantle that vision, but he appears to have been particularly concerned about the viability of different businesses.If something went wrong, Tata would tell you to your face and then take immediate steps to rectify the problem, said a senior Tata Sons executive who has known Ratan Tata for more than two decades. He described Tata as a humanist with a deep sense of compassion, who was keen on products that fostered social justice like the Nano, or Tata Salt.In 2012, after grooming Mistry for the top job for a year, Tata stepped down as group chairman, and moved from his relatively modest apartment to a white, three-story house he built on the seafront near the exclusive Colaba neighbourhood of Mumbai, with a private gym and rooftop infinity pool looking out over the Arabian Sea, according to local newspaper reports.Start-up InvestingHe threw his energies into working with entrepreneurs, investing nominal sums in more than three dozen startups ranging from artificial intelligence to online sales of womens lingerie.Those who met him spoke of his imposing presence, graciousness and attention to detail in how ideas would work.Mr Tata. listens intently, has a curiosity to learn and often gives a fresh perspective that hasnt been considered, said Vani Kola, head of venture capital fund Kalaari Capital. He notices the smallest things, he puts people at ease.At the same time, he continued to keep any eye on the Tata Group as head of the powerful family trusts that hold a majority stake in Tata Sons. According to several people who know Tata, he became increasingly frustrated by what was happening to the company that bore his name.On 24 October, before the board meeting in Bombay House, where stray dogs are allowed to roam the corridors, Mistry was told of the decision to remove him.Cyrus Mistry was handpicked by Ratan Tata, said Goenka. This time he will look for someone who understands the Tata culture and the Tata way of doing things, better. Bloomberg",2016-11-08,ylJCy9morUM9QsY5DRkqhN,"Tata group, the dynastic business that built a reputation over more than a century for discretion, integrity and fair-dealing has sunk into a public spat of allegations and name-calling",11:24,Ratan Tatas return as interim chairman seen taking toll on Brand Tata

Nilekani, who serves as an honorary adviser to NPCI on innovation and public policy and was one of the key brains behind UPI, said that once some of the teething issues with the current version of UPI are sorted out, the system will be ready to take off in a big way, especially in e-commerce.

This was a remarkable innovation because for the first time it gave you 24x7 instant credit. For example, in a very short period of time, in less than five years, the volume on IMPS has gone to Rs24,000 crore a month and it has become the de facto way of doing remittances in India. Thats the great success story that NPCI created and is really the first product to do instant credit. But it couldnt be used for merchant payments because for that you need instant debit Then some of us got together and were discussing that with the rise of smartphones, there was a need to build on the success of IMPS and to build something which was world-class, could do both credit and debit, smartphone-to-smartphone, etc. Then NPCI appointed me as an honorary adviser on innovation and public policy so that I could share my inputs and entered into an MoU (memorandum of understanding) with iSpirt (software product industry lobby group)... This all happened in late 2014. Then in February 2015, we had the launch of UPI by (RBI) governor (Raghuram) Rajan, who was always a big supporter of the idea. It took them a year to get the software built by RS Software, etc. So it was basically built as a layer on top of IMPS with debit. And then all these great innovations came, like virtual payment address (VPA), push-and-pull payments, etc.all that was the work of the iSpirt and NPCI teams... It took us more than a year to get it done. Then the actual launch happened in April 2016. Then another two-three months to test out everything and get all the banks going. And finally they went live about a month ago.What were some of the triggers behind the creation of UPI?We felt we were in a unique position because there was an organization like NPCI which was a very strong organization on payments, set up by the banks and owned collectively by the banks. And this organization had come into being coincidentally around the same time as UIDAIboth came up in 2009. There has been a very close working relationship between UIDAI and NPCI, which led to the creation of Aadhaar payment bridge, etc. Since it was a bank-owned utility, it was well-geared to offer an interoperable system. RBI was supportive, not just the governor but also the department of payments.How is UPI different from other payment systems in countries like the US and China?In the US and China, its like a walled garden where a couple of key players control the system. For example, in China you have the likes of WeChat and AliPay. With UPI, anyone can build on top of it and innovateits open and inclusive. Its almost like being on a highway without any toll gates.Whats your assessment of where UPI is at right now? What are some of the things that still need to be fixed?This is a mammoth task taking a countrys payments system and make it go into the completely 21st century online real time...across smartphones, fully secure, encrypted, virtual payment addresses, etc. This is a major thingthere are bound to be teething issues. There are some teething issues in onboarding customers and so on, but I think its all par for the course. Itll take a couple of months to settle that down. But as more banks like SBI (State Bank of India) and HDFC (Bank) come online, more and more of Indias banking terms will be on UPI. And then once all these teething issues are sorted out, Im very confident itll take off because it is such a superior value proposition. Both for online and offline merchant payments and both for online B2B (business to business) payments.Whats next for UPI? What should we expect in the next 6-12 months?The idea is that in the next couple of months all the technical issues, all the onboarding issues, all the user interface issues would have been shaken outany concerns that people have. All the banks will be live. All the major merchants should be live. There will be a few hundred thousand customers who will be ready to transact with their VPAs and apps. And there will be choice for consumers to select very attractive apps from a number of banks. Once you have that, you have the ground conditions for take-off. My sense is that the first take-off will happen in the online, e-commerce world. And then the same thing will migrate to the offline world...The big thing to remember is that in the typical card world, you went from offline to online. In the UPI world, were going from online to offline.",2016-10-12,zV5lj7FoBJ2s1KM8orBEKJ,"UIDAIs former boss Nandan Nilekani on the origins of Unified Payments Interface, NPCI and RBIs role in its development, and whats next for UPI",03:32,UPI is almost like being on a highway without toll gates: Nandan Nilekani
0.24,"New Delhi: One of the biggest expectations with Union Budget 2017 was that the government would divulge details of how much money has come back to the banking system after demonetisation. While the budget has disappointed in terms of giving overall statistics on this count, it does give an idea about the extent of money which has come in deposits of Rs2 lakh and above.
				   
				This is what Arun Jaitley had to say in his budget speech: After the demonetisation, the preliminary analysis of data received in respect of deposits made by people in old currency presents a revealing picture. During the period 8th November to 30th December 2016, deposits between Rs2 lakh and Rs80 lakh were made in about 1.09 crore accounts with an average deposit size of Rs5.03 lakh. Deposits of more than 80 lakh were made in 1.48 lakh accounts with average deposit size of Rs3.31 crores.Union Budget 2017: Key highlights and themesThe total amount which has been deposited under these two categories can be calculated by multiplying the number of accounts with the average deposit figures mentioned by Jaitley. This gives a figure of Rs5.48 lakh crores for deposits worth less than Rs80 lakh and Rs4.89 lakh crore for more than Rs80 lakh. The aggregate deposits under the two categories amount to Rs10.38 lakh crore. This works out to around two-third of the total value of demonetised currency, which was valued at around 15.44 lakh crore. These figures also tell us that around 31% of total value of demonetised currency has come back in individual deposits of Rs80 lakh or more. These figures show that a large chunk of the demonetised currency which has come back into banks is from the super-rich.How much of the deposits reflect unearthed black money?According to Jaitley, there are more than 3 lakh companies which show profits. There are 76 lakh individuals who report annual income greater than Rs5 lakh. Out of this 56 lakh individuals belong to the salaried class, which means that their avenues for tax evasion are extremely limited. The rest 20 lakh individuals include businessmen and professionals.It is possible that several of the high-deposit accounts belong to those who are already in the tax net, and have legitimate reasons for holding on to cash. The finance minister has not said anything about whether these are individual or business accounts. In the latter category, a lot of cash could be classified as cash in hand for business purposes, and it would be difficult to say whether these deposits reflect unearthed black money.However these numbers point to one unequivocal conclusion: most of the super-rich did not flush their cash stocks down the pit. Instead, they have chosen to park their money with banks, fully aware that this might invite scrutiny from taxmen. It is therefore likely that they will have good answers ready if and when the taxmen come to ask questions. There is very little reason to hope that the post-demonetisation data mining exercise will help unearth a significant amount of black money. This should not come as a surprise to those who have taken even a cursory look at the findings of taxmen on black money, who have reported in the past that cash is the least preferred way of holding unaccounted money.",2017-02-01,zhdFUJDvLzNJNFe0puDjbO,"About Rs10.38 lakh crore in demonetised currency was deposited in 2.57 lakh bank accounts, showing that a large chunk of the amount came from the super-rich",21:08,Arun Jaitleys budget speech gives clues about demonetisation deposits in banks
0.29,"India is making efforts to set up one more container trans-shipment terminal, closer to the east-west trade lane, with the cabinet approving a facility at Enayam in Tamil Nadu. The success of the latest trans-shipment adventure will squarely rest on getting one of the global top three container shipping lines to become an anchor investor in what is essentially a liner-driven business.
				   
				For that to happen, India needs to revisit its qualification criteria for selecting potential terminal developers at its major portsthose owned by the central government.The evaluation criteria for potential bidders set by the government in 2009 ignores the role played by shipping lines in contributing to the performance of a container terminal let alone a container trans-shipment terminal.In computing the experience score of an applicant to consider it eligible for qualification, experience in core sectors such as power, telecom, ports, airports, railways, metro rail, industrial parks/estates, logistic parks, pipelines, irrigation, water supply, sewerage and real estate development are factored in. Experience in running a shipping line, which brings business to these trans-shipment hubs, is not included.This explains why none of the global container shipping lines are part of container terminals operating at major ports. Since they dont bring any value to the table for qualification purposes, port developers are loath to signing them up as partners.On their own, they dont qualify because shipping is not part of the core sectors drawn up for working out experience scores.Geneva-based Mediterranean Shipping Co. SA (MSC), the worlds second biggest container shipping line, did apply in partnership with Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) in an auction for developing a container terminal project at Jawaharlal Nehru Port a couple of years ago. The APSEZ-MSC team was qualified to bid, but the experience score for that joint venture was counted on the basis of APSEZs credentials.This is not the situation at non-major ports or ports owned by the states but given to private firms for development and operations. For instance, APSEZ, which runs Indias biggest private port at Mundra in Gujarat, has two of the worlds top three container shipping companiesMSC and CMA-CGM SAas partners in two separate terminals.Unlike gateway terminals, trans-shipment facilities are dependent on big container lines, a fact that has been acknowledged globally.Trans-shipment hubs such as the ones located at Tanjung Pelepas in Malaysia and Colombo in Sri Lanka have shown that having a shipping line as anchor investor in the port (Maersk Line in the case of both Tanjung Pelepas and Colombo) is eventually the determinant of success. Making the liner invest in the port makes it a stakeholder in the ports success and, thus, incentivizes it to move existing traffic and establish a minimum scale of operation. The liners are also keen to operate from a port where they have investments since this will enable them to influence port planning decisions and port operations, take long-term bets while planning routes/vessel commissioning decisions and help improve overall cost economics and flexibility on pricing.About 25%, or some 2.8 million twenty foot equivalent units, or TEUs, the standard size of a cargo container, originating from or destined for India, is trans-shipped every year at overseas hubs, en-route to their final destination.Colombo, Singapore and Port Klang (Malysia) handle more than 80% of this cargo. Of this, Colombo alone handles around 1.2 million TEUs, which is a significant loss of revenue for Indias exporters, importers and ports; it builds inefficiencies in logistics and creates risk to the countrys competitiveness in export trade.The shipping ministry says there is a strong economic case for building a new trans-shipment hub in and around the same region to attract Indian and regional trans-shipment traffic from the current hubs. But is it justified?Enayam will be the third container trans-shipment terminal to be located a few kms apart from each other on Indias southern tip. Of this, Vallarpadam in Cochin port has been operational since 2011 without much success. None of the global top three container lines are an anchor investor in the facility, which is also facing multiple hurdles in its efforts to become a major hub as planned.Vizhinjam, also in Kerala, is being developed by APSEZ. There are indications one of the top three global container lines could make Vizhinjam its trans-shipment hub as the qualification rules applicable to major ports will not be relevant here as it is a port outside the control of the centre.APSEZs strong ties with two of the top three container lines at its Mundra port, where one of the container terminalsa joint venture between APSEZ and MSCis undertaking trans-shipment operations, would help make a similar partnership a reality at Vizhinjam. There are several more commercial advantages, including pricing flexibilities that flow from building a trans-shipment hub outside Indian government ownership. Vizhinjam has also secured the key environment clearance, which Enayam is yet to receive. Enayams success, to a great extent, will depend on its ability to convince a major shipping liner to become an anchor client and re-route its traffic from the competing ports, consultants TYPSA and Boston Consulting Group wrote in their techno-economic feasibility report on the Enayam project.Container shipping lines take a long-term view and consider several factors such as minimum deviation from the main trade route, and lower port charges when deciding their preferred trans-shipment port, given the costs of reconfiguring their existing route networks, according to TYPSA and BCG.But, given that Enayam is being developed as a major port like Vallarpadam in Cochin and the consequent applicability of shipping-unfriendly evaluation criteria, it calls for a change in rules.With Indias shipping ministry set to revise a so-called model concession agreement (MCA) for public-private-partnership (PPP) projects at major ports, the time is apt for reviewing the qualification rules. MCA sets the terms and conditions of a port contract.P.
